5276,Abstracts of the MASCC/ISOO Annual Meeting 2018,2018-04-23,"The +1 frameshift mutation, M5631, which is located in the gene (oxi1) for cytochrome c oxidase II (COXII) of the yeast mitochondrial genome, is suppressed spontaneously to a remarkably high extent (20%–30%). The full-length wild-type COXII produced as a result of suppression allows the mutant strain to grow with a “leaky” phenotype on non-fermentable medium. In order to elucidate the factors and interactions involved in this translational suppression, the strain with the frameshift mutation was mutated by MnCl(2) treatment and a large number of mutants showing restriction of the suppression were isolated. Of 20 mutants exhibiting a strong, restricted, respiration-deficient (RD) phenotype, 6 were identified as having mutations in the mitochondrial genome. Furthermore, genetic analyses mapped one mutation to the vicinity of the gene for tRNA(Pro) and two others to a region of the tRNA cluster where two-thirds of all mitochondrial tRNA genes are encoded. The degree of restriction of the spontaneous frameshift suppression was characterized at the translational level by in vivo (35)S-labeling of the mitochondrial translational products and immunoblotting. These results showed that in some of these mutant strains the frameshift suppression product is synthesized to the same extent as in the leaky parent strain. It is suggested that more than one +1 frame-shifted product is made as a result of suppression in these strains: one is as functional as the wild-type COXII, the other(s) is (are) non-functional and prevent leaky growth on non-fermentable medium. A possible mechanism for this heterogenous frameshift suppression is discussed.","Sakai, Hajime; Stiess, Renate; Weiss-Brummer, Brigitte",Mol Gen Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088400/,478
6167,3D Printed Patient-Specific Acetabular Jig for Cup Placement in Total Hip Arthroplasty,2020-03-17,"The conjugation of ubiquitin, a 76-amino-acid peptide, to a protein substrate provides a tag that either marks the labelled protein for degradation or modulates its function. The process of protein ubiquitylation — which is catalysed by coordinated enzymatic reactions that are mediated by enzymes known as E1, E2 and E3 — has an important role in the modulation of immune responses. Importantly, protein ubiquitylation is a reversible process, and removal of ubiquitin molecules is mediated by de-ubiquitylating enzymes: for example, A20, which has been implicated in the regulation of immune responses. In addition, the conjugation of ubiquitin-like molecules, such as ISG15 (interferon-stimulated protein of 15 kDa), to proteins is also involved in immune regulation. This Review covers recent progress in our understanding of protein ubiquitylation in the immune system.","Liu, Yun-Cai; Penninger, Josef; Karin, Michael",Nat Rev Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096784/,478
7055,"Irish Thoracic Society Annual Scientific Meeting, Ramada Hotel, Belfast: 7th–8th November 2008",2008-10-21,"Introduction: Chloroquine (CQ) has been well known for its antimalarial effects since World War II. However, it is gradually being phased out from clinical use against malaria due to emergence of CQ-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains. Besides low cost and tolerability, ongoing research has revealed interesting biochemical properties of CQ that have inspired its repurposing/repositioning in the management of various infectious/noninfectious diseases. Consequently, several novel compounds and compositions based on its scaffold have been studied and patented. Areas covered: In this review, patents describing CQ and its derivatives/compositions over the last 5 years are analyzed. The review highlights the rationale, chemical structures, biological evaluation and potential therapeutic application of CQ, its derivatives and compositions. Expert opinion: Repurposing efforts have dominantly focused on racemic CQ with no studies exploring the effect of the (R) and (S) enantiomers, which might potentially have additional benefits in other diseases. Additionally, evaluating other similarly acting antimalarials in clinical use and structural analogs could help maximize the intrinsic value of the 4-aminoquinolines. With regard to cancer therapy, successful repurposing of CQ-containing compounds will require linking the mode of action of these antimalarials with the signaling pathways that drive cancer cell proliferation to facilitate the development of a 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline that can be used as a synergistic partner in anticancer combination chemotherapy.","Njaria, Paul M; Okombo, John; Njuguna, Nicholas M; Chibale, Kelly",Expert Opin Ther Pat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7103710/,478
9479,Post-transplantation Outcomes in Patients with PA or MMA: A Review of the Literature,2020-04-08,"The smooth muscle of the airways is exposed to continuously changing mechanical forces during normal breathing. The mechanical oscillations that occur during breathing have profound effects on airway tone and airway responsiveness both in experimental animals and humans in vivo and in isolated airway tissues in vitro. Experimental evidence suggests that alterations in the contractile and mechanical properties of airway smooth muscle tissues caused by mechanical perturbations result from adaptive changes in the organization of the cytoskeletal architecture of the smooth muscle cell. The cytoskeleton is a dynamic structure that undergoes rapid reorganization in response to external mechanical and pharmacologic stimuli. Contractile stimulation initiates the assembly of cytoskeletal/extracellular matrix adhesion complex proteins into large macromolecular signaling complexes (adhesomes) that undergo activation to mediate the polymerization and reorganization of a submembranous network of actin filaments at the cortex of the cell. Cortical actin polymerization is catalyzed by Neuronal-Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and the Arp2/3 complex, which are activated by pathways regulated by paxillin and the small GTPase, cdc42. These processes create a strong and rigid cytoskeletal framework that may serve to strengthen the membrane for the transmission of force generated by the contractile apparatus to the extracellular matrix, and to enable the adaptation of smooth muscle cells to mechanical stresses. This model for the regulation of airway smooth muscle function can provide novel perspectives to explain the normal physiologic behavior of the airways and pathophysiologic properties of the airways in asthma.","Zhang, Wenwu; Gunst, Susan J.",J Eng Sci Med Diagn Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7141576/,478
9630,Shelter hospital mode: How do we prevent COVID-19 hospital-acquired infection?,2020-03-30,"Outcomes of cardiac surgery are influenced by systemic inflammation. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a pivotal inflammatory mediator, plays a potential role as a prognostic biomarker in cardiovascular disease. The aim of this prospective, observational study was to investigate the relationship between serum HMGB1 concentrations and composite of morbidity endpoints in cardiac surgery. Arterial blood samples for HMGB1 measurement were collected from 250 patients after anaesthetic induction (baseline) and 1 h after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (post-CPB). The incidence of composite of morbidity endpoints (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure and prolonged ventilator care) was compared in relation to the tertile distribution of serum HMGB1 concentrations. The incidence of composite of morbidity endpoints was significantly different with respect to the tertile distribution of post-CPB HMGB1 concentrations (p = 0.005) only, and not to the baseline. Multivariable analysis revealed post-CPB HMGB1 concentration (OR, 1.072; p = 0.044), pre-operative creatinine and duration of CPB as independent risk factors of adverse outcome. Accounting for its prominent role in mediating sterile inflammation and its relation to detrimental outcome, HMGB1 measured 1 h after weaning from CPB would serve as a useful biomarker for accurate risk stratification in cardiac surgical patients and may guide tailored anti-inflammatory therapy.","Kim, Namo; Lee, Sak; Lee, Jeong-Rim; Kwak, Young-Lan; Jun, Ji-Hae; Shim, Jae-Kwang",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156763/,478
11276,Translation of the Frailty Paradigm from Older Adults to Children with Cardiac Disease,2020-05-06,"On 31 March 2019, 68 school students suffered from vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain after participating in a group activity at a commercial park. In this outbreak, multiple norovirus genotypes were observed, including GII.2[P16], GII.17[P17], and GII.13[P21]. Further, we determined the full-genome sequences of two strains of GII.13[P21] recombinant noroviruses, which were 7434 nt long. Phylogenetic analysis based on open reading frames (ORFs) 1 and 2 revealed that these recombinants were related to stains of different genotypes from different countries. The full genome nucleotide sequences of the two isolates were 97.0% and 98.0% identical to those of strains from London and Thailand, respectively. Simplot analysis revealed the presence of a break point at nt 5059 in the ORF1 region. The histo-blood group antigen binding sites were conserved in both recombinant viruses. Our findings not only provide valuable genetic information about a recombinant norovirus but also contribute to our general understanding of the evolution, genetic diversity, and distribution of noroviruses.","Huang, Zheng; Yao, Dong; Xiao, Shan; Yang, Dong; Ou, Xinhua",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223583/,478

14620,"Community-setting pneumonia-associated hospitalizations by level of urbanization—New York City versus other areas of New York State, 2010–2014",2020-12-23,"BACKGROUND: Proteins with low complexity regions (LCRs) have atypical sequence and structural features. Their amino acid composition varies from the expected, determined proteome-wise, and they do not follow the rules of structural folding that prevail in globular regions. One way to characterize these regions is by assessing the repeatability of a sequence, that is, calculating the local propensity of a region to be part of a repeat. RESULTS: We combine two local measures of low complexity, repeatability (using the RES algorithm) and fraction of the most frequent amino acid, to evaluate different proteomes, datasets of protein regions with specific features, and individual cases of proteins with extreme compositions. We apply a representation called ‘low complexity triangle’ as a proof-of-concept to represent the low complexity measured values. Results show that proteomes have distinct signatures in the low complexity triangle, and that these signatures are associated to complexity features of the sequences. We developed a web tool called LCT (http://cbdm-01.zdv.uni-mainz.de/~munoz/lct/) to allow users to calculate the low complexity triangle of a given protein or region of interest. CONCLUSIONS: The low complexity triangle proves to be a suitable procedure to represent the general low complexity of a sequence or protein dataset. Homorepeats, direpeats, compositionally biased regions and globular regions occupy characteristic positions in the triangle. The described pipeline can be used to characterize LCRs and may help in quantifying the content of degenerated tandem repeats in proteins and proteomes.","Mier, Pablo; Andrade-Navarro, Miguel A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7773278/,478
15273,Tomographic findings in bronchial atresia,2021,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), a member of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily, are abundant in human ocular tissues and play an important role in lens development. Targeted deletion of BMP-4 in mice results in failure of lens placode formation. Following lens maturation, the formation of senile cataracts is demonstrably associated with free radical-related oxidative stress. Previous studies reported that BMPs play an antiapoptotic role in cells under oxidative stress, and the BMP-4 signal is important in inflammation regulation and homeostasis. BMP-4 evidently suppressed the apoptosis of human lens epithelial cells (HLECS) under oxidative stress induced by H(2)O(2). This protective antiapoptotic effect is partly due to a decrease in caspase-3 activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Furthermore, the expression of activating transcription factor- (ATF-) 6 and Krüppel-like factor- (KLF-) 6 increased under oxidative stress and decreased after BMP-4 treatment.","Du, Bei; Zheng, Jia-Lin; Huang, Liang-Yu; Zhang, Hong; Wang, Qiong; Hong, Ya-Ru; Zhang, Xiao-min; Li, Xiao-Rong; Dong, Li-Jie",Biomed Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7864734/,478
15511,Assessment of muscular tone of the tongue using a digital measure spoon in a healthy population: A pilot study,2021-02-18,"We have previously developed and validated a one-step assay based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for rapid detection of the Zika virus (ZIKV) from mosquito samples. Patient diagnosis of ZIKV is currently carried out in centralized laboratories using the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), which, while the gold standard molecular method, has several drawbacks for use in remote and low-resource settings, such as high cost and the need of specialized equipment. Point-of-care (POC) diagnostic platforms have the potential to overcome these limitations, especially in low-resource countries where ZIKV is endemic. With this in mind, here we optimized and validated our RT-LAMP assay for rapid detection of ZIKV from patient samples. We found that the assay detected ZIKV from diverse sample types (serum, urine, saliva, and semen) in as little as 20 min, without RNA extraction. The RT-LAMP assay was highly specific and up to 100 times more sensitive than RT-qPCR. We then validated the assay using 100 patient serum samples collected from suspected cases of arbovirus infection in the state of Pernambuco, which was at the epicenter of the last Zika epidemic. Analysis of the results, in comparison to RT-qPCR, found that the ZIKV RT-LAMP assay provided sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93.75%, and an overall accuracy of 95.00%. Taken together, the RT-LAMP assay provides a straightforward and inexpensive alternative for the diagnosis of ZIKV from patients and has the potential to increase diagnostic capacity in ZIKV-affected areas, particularly in low and middle-income countries.","da Silva, Severino Jefferson Ribeiro; Pardee, Keith; Balasuriya, Udeni B.

15573,A long-lasting emerging epidemic of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in southeastern Iran: population movement and peri-urban settlements as a major risk factor,2021-02-24,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The effect of green tea and coffee consumption on mortality among cardiovascular diseases survivors is unknown. We examined the association between green tea and coffee consumption and mortality among persons with and without stroke or myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS: In the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study, 46 213 participants (478 stroke survivors, 1214 MI survivors, and 44 521 persons without a history of stroke or MI), aged 40 to 79 years at baseline (1988–1990), completed a lifestyle, diet, and medical history questionnaire and were followed up regarding mortality until 2009. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate the multivariable hazard ratios with 95% CIs of all-cause mortality after adjusting for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: During the 18.5-year median follow-up period, 9253 cases were documented. Green tea consumption was inversely associated with all-cause mortality among stroke or MI survivors; the multivariable hazard ratios (95% CIs) for stroke survivors were 0.73 (0.42–1.27) for 1 to 6 cups/wk, 0.65 (0.36–1.15) for 1 to 2 cups/d, 0.56 (0.34–0.92) for 3 to 4 cups/d, 0.52 (0.31–0.86) for 5 to 6 cups/d, and 0.38 (0.20–0.71) for ≥7 cups/d, compared with nondrinkers. A similar inverse association was observed for MI survivors, but not evident for those without a history of stroke or MI. Coffee consumption was inversely associated with all-cause mortality in persons without a history of stroke or MI; the multivariable hazard ratios (95% CIs) were 0.86 (0.82–0.91) for 1 to 6 cups/wk, 0.86 (0.80–0.92) for 1 cup/d, and 0.82 (0.77–0.89) for ≥2 cups/d, compared with nondrinkers. The corresponding hazard ratios (95% CIs) for MI survivors were 0.69 (0.53–0.91), 0.78 (0.55–1.10), and 0.61 (0.41–0.90). No such association was observed for stroke survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Green tea consumption can be beneficial in improving the prognosis for stroke or MI survivors, whereas coffee consumption can also be so for persons without a history of stroke or MI as well as MI survivors.","Teramoto, Masayuki; Muraki, Isao; Yamagishi, Kazumasa; Tamakoshi, Akiko; Iso, Hiroyasu",Stroke,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7903984/,478
16437,The Smart Aging Platform for Assessing Early Phases of Cognitive Impairment in Patients With Neurodegenerative Diseases,2021-03-15,"Celiac disease (CeD) is a common autoimmune disorder caused by an abnormal immune response to dietary gluten proteins. The disease has high heritability. HLA is the major susceptibility factor, and the HLA effect is mediated via presentation of deamidated gluten peptides by disease-associated HLA-DQ variants to CD4+ T cells. In addition to gluten-specific CD4+ T cells the patients have antibodies to transglutaminase 2 (autoantigen) and deamidated gluten peptides. These disease-specific antibodies recognize defined epitopes and they display common usage of specific heavy and light chains across patients. Interactions between T cells and B cells are likely central in the pathogenesis, but how the repertoires of naïve T and B cells relate to the pathogenic effector cells is unexplored. To this end, we applied machine learning classification models to naïve B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires from CeD patients and healthy controls. Strikingly, we obtained a promising classification performance with an F1 score of 85%. Clusters of heavy and light chain sequences were inferred and used as features for the model, and signatures associated with the disease were then characterized. These signatures included amino acid (AA) 3-mers with distinct bio-physiochemical characteristics and enriched V and J genes. We found that CeD-associated clusters can be identified and that common motifs can be characterized from naïve BCR repertoires. The results may indicate a genetic influence by BCR encoding genes in CeD. Analysis of naïve BCRs as presented here may become an important part of assessing the risk of individuals to develop CeD. Our model demonstrates the potential of using BCR repertoires and in particular, naïve BCR repertoires, as disease susceptibility markers.","Shemesh, Or; Polak, Pazit; Lundin, Knut E.

However, little is known regarding the role of CAR in neonates with sepsis. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between CAR and neonatal sepsis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this research, from January 2016 to February 2020, a total of 1076 neonates were enrolled at Henan Children’s Hospital in China. Complete clinical and laboratory data were collected. To identify the potential independent risk factor for neonatal sepsis, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of CAR in identifying neonatal sepsis. RESULTS: CAR levels were higher in neonates with sepsis and showed a gradual increase among the control group, mild sepsis group and severe sepsis group. The prevalence of neonates with overall sepsis, mild sepsis and severe sepsis increased significantly from CAR tertile 1 to tertile 3. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that CAR was an independent risk factor for the presence of sepsis (OR = 10.144, 95% CI 4.151–24.790, P < 0.001) and severe sepsis (OR = 1.876, 95% CI 1.562–2.253, P < 0.001). ROC curve analysis showed that CAR had a well discriminatory power in predicting sepsis (area under curve (AUC) = 0.74, 95% CI, 0.71–0.77, P < 0.001) and severe sepsis (AUC = 0.70, 95% CI, 0.67–0.74, P < 0.001).

19554,"Utilisation and predictors of use of exposure therapy in the treatment of anxiety, OCD and PTSD in an Australian sample: a preliminary investigation",2021-07-27,"INTRODUCTION: Zero-dose prevalence refers to children who failed to receive any routine vaccination. Little is known about the “immunisation cascade” in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), defined as how children move from zero dose to full immunisation. METHODS: Using data from national surveys carried out in 92 LMICs since 2010 and focusing on the four basic vaccines delivered in infancy (BCG, polio, DPT and MCV), we describe zero-dose prevalence and the immunisation cascade in children aged 12 to 23 months. We also describe the most frequent combinations of vaccines (or co-coverage) among children who are partially immunized. Analyses are stratified by country income groups, household wealth quintiles derived from asset indices, sex of the child and area of residence. Results were pooled across countries using child populations as weights. RESULTS: In the 92 countries, 7.7% were in the zero-dose group, and 3.3%, 3.4% and 14.6% received one, two or three vaccines, respectively; 70.9% received the four types and 59.9% of the total were fully immunised with all doses of the four vaccines. Three quarters (76.8%) of children who received the first vaccine received all four types. Among children with a single vaccine, polio was the most common in low- and lower-middle income countries, and BCG in upper-middle income countries. There were sharp inequalities according to household wealth, with zero-dose prevalence ranging from 12.5% in the poorest to 3.4% in the wealthiest quintile across all countries. The cascades were similar for boys and girls. In terms of dropout, 4% of children receiving BCG did not receive DPT1, 14% receiving DPT1 did not receive DPT3, and 9% receiving DPT3 did not progress to receive MCV. Interpretation. Focusing on zero-dose children is particularly important because those who are reached with the first vaccine are highly likely to also receive remaining vaccines.","Cata-Preta, Bianca O.; Santos, Thiago M.; Mengistu, Tewodaj; Hogan, Daniel R.; Barros, Aluisio J.D.; Victora, Cesar G.",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8314014/,478
19704,A Quality Improvement Approach to Influence Value-based Mucolytic Use in the PICU,2021-07-28,"BACKGROUND: Understanding public health risk perceptions is essential in efficient environmental health management. In the light of the negative impact of air pollution on health and the direct and indirect mediation of this impact through risk perceptions, it is crucial to better understand the lay perceptions of air pollution. Since qualitative research methods are well suited for this aim, the central objective of this study is to present a review of qualitative research articles in the field of environmental epidemiology that investigate health risk perceptions of ambient air pollution since the 2000s. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA-guidelines which resulted in a selection of 20 scientific articles published in peer-reviewed academic journals that used qualitative research methods and reported on health risk perceptions about ambient air pollution. RESULTS: Qualitative research in the field of environmental epidemiology is still scarce. Most of the studies included in the review were based on face-to-face interviews and focus group discussions; a minority used a mixed-method approach. Interesting contributions were made with respect to both the perception of exposure to air pollution and the perception of the health effect associated with air pollution. CONCLUSIONS: The review suggests that data generated through qualitative research might complement the traditionally quantitative field of environmental epidemiology. Mixed method multidisciplinary research is likely to provide a more holistic explanation of environmental health patterns observed through quantitative research. These explanations are key in managing environmental health and in developing successful prevention, mitigation and communication strategies. Implementing qualitative research methods contribute to the field of environmental epidemiology as it i) allows for triangulation of findings; ii) generates nuanced findings and new research questions; iii) triggers in-depth understandings of quantitatively identified patterns; iv) leads to additional surprising and/or multifaceted responses; v) enhances relationships between researcher and respondent; vi) increases the awareness of important context-dependent dynamics or interactions that may generate biases and vii) grasps the local, contextual, situational and cultural elements that interact with health risk perceptions.","Noël, Charlotte; Vanroelen, Christophe; Gadeyne, Sylvie",SSM Popul Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8325091/,478

In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, social isolation induces stark changes in behavior including increased aggression, locomotor activity, and resistance to ethanol sedation. To identify genes regulating sensitivity to isolation, I screened a collection of sixteen hundred P-element insertion lines for mutants with abnormal levels of all three isolation-induced behaviors. The screen identified three mutants whose affected genes are likely central to regulating the effects of isolation in flies. One mutant, sex pistol (sxp), became extremely aggressive and resistant to ethanol sedation when socially isolated. sxp also had a high level of male–male courtship. The mutation in sxp reduced the expression of two minor isoforms of the actin regulator hts (adducin), as well as mildly reducing expression of CalpA, a calcium-dependent protease. As a consequence, sxp also had increased expression of the insulin-like peptide, dILP5. Analysis of the social behavior of sxp suggests that these minor hts isoforms function to limit isolation-induced aggression, while chronically high levels of dILP5 increase male–male courtship.","Eddison, Mark",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8405609/,478
21231,It is time for TEG in pediatric trauma: unveiling meaningful alterations in children who undergo massive transfusion,2021-09-17,"Cell culture-derived defective interfering particles (DIPs) are considered for antiviral therapy due to their ability to inhibit influenza A virus (IAV) production. DIPs contain a large internal deletion in one of their eight viral RNAs (vRNAs) rendering them replication-incompetent. However, they can propagate alongside their homologous standard virus (STV) during infection in a competition for cellular and viral resources. So far, experimental and modeling studies for IAV have focused on either the intracellular or the cell population level when investigating the interaction of STVs and DIPs. To examine these levels simultaneously, we conducted a series of experiments using highly different multiplicities of infections for STVs and DIPs to characterize virus replication in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney suspension cells. At several time points post infection, we quantified virus titers, viable cell concentration, virus-induced apoptosis using imaging flow cytometry, and intracellular levels of vRNA and viral mRNA using real-time reverse transcription qPCR. Based on the obtained data, we developed a mathematical multiscale model of STV and DIP co-infection that describes dynamics closely for all scenarios with a single set of parameters. We show that applying high DIP concentrations can shut down STV propagation completely and prevent virus-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, the three observed viral mRNAs (full-length segment 1 and 5, defective interfering segment 1) accumulated to vastly different levels suggesting the interplay between an internal regulation mechanism and a growth advantage for shorter viral RNAs. Furthermore, model simulations predict that the concentration of DIPs should be at least 10000 times higher than that of STVs to prevent the spread of IAV. Ultimately, the model presented here supports a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between STVs and DIPs during co-infection providing an ideal platform for the prediction and optimization of vaccine manufacturing as well as DIP production for therapeutic use.","Rüdiger, Daniel; Pelz, Lars; Hein, Marc D.; Kupke, Sascha Y.; Reichl, Udo",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8448327/,478

This study investigates the antecedents of patients’ satisfaction relating to telemedicine adoption in rural public hospitals settings in Bangladesh through the adaptation of Expectation Disconfirmation Theory extended by Social Cognitive Theory. This research advances a theoretically sustained prediction model forecasting patients’ satisfaction with telemedicine to enable informed decision making. A research model explores four potential antecedents: expectations, performance, disconfirmation, and enjoyment; that significantly contribute to predicting patients’ satisfaction concerning telemedicine adoption in Bangladesh.

Under a theoretical framework derived from the Blob model, we chemically crosslinked high molecular weight hyaluronic acid at a concentration close to its overlap concentration (c*), and created synthetic soft hydrogels that exhibited unique rheological properties similar to a natural soft hydrogel: being dominantly elastic under low shear stress while being viscous when the stress is above a small threshold. We explored a potential application of the hyaluronic acid‐based soft hydrogel as a long‐acting ocular surface lubricant and evaluated its therapeutic effects for dry eye. The soft hydrogel was found to be biocompatible after topical instillation on experimental animals' and companion dogs' eyes. In a canine clinical study, twice‐a‐day ocular instillation of the soft hydrogel in combination with cyclosporine for 1 month improved the clinical signs in more than 65% of dog patients previously unresponsive to cyclosporine treatment.","Yu, Yu; Chow, Derek Wai Yee; Lau, Chi Ming Laurence; Zhou, Guanqun; Back, Woojin; Xu, Jing; Carim, Sean; Chau, Ying",Bioeng Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8459603/,478

32119,A quantitative study of day–night changes in the spatial distribution of insects in a stony stream,2002-03-05,"Despite the concern over the potential loss of structural information as a result of the use of peptides as opposed to proteins as molecular probes, peptide arrays have been implemented in a broad range of applications including antibody screening and epitope mapping, characterization of molecular interactions, and enzymatic activity profiling, and they have become a valuable tool for proteomics research. In this chapter, we first (Sect. 7.1) recapitulate the development of these arrays and highlight a couple of key improvements in the array production and the application in proteomics research. For clinical and biomarker development applications, it is important to measure entities that are directly related to physiological function (and dysfunction). In this respect, the assessment of enzymatic activities is obviously preferable to genotyping, expression profiling, or even measurement of protein amounts. In Sect. 7.2, an original technology based on peptides arrayed onto a porous support allows detailed profiling of kinase activities in a biological sample. The applications described range from kinase characterization to inhibition profiles, detection of off-target effects, and drug response prediction in a clinical setting, allowing rational choice of the drug to be used. Such directly functional approaches will have an important role in the transition to more personalized medicine. Finally, in Sect. 7.3, a recently developed method for “laser printing” of peptide arrays that will make these approaches much more practical is presented.","Zhang, Hong; Pelech, Steven; Ruijtenbeek, Rob; Felgenhauer, Thomas; Bischoff, Ralf; Breitling, Frank; Stadler, Volker",Microarrays in Diagnostics and Biomarker Development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7193736/,478

33971,Title Page,2020-06-06,"The authors propose a dynamic hierarchical linear model (DHLM) to study the variations in the costs of trade finance over time and across countries in dynamic environments such as the global financial crisis of 2008–2009. The DHLM can cope with challenges that a dynamic environment entails: nonstationarity, parameters changing over time and cross-sectional heterogeneity. The authors employ a DHLM to examine how the effects of four macroeconomic indicators – GDP growth, inflation, trade intensity and stock market capitalization - on trade finance costs varied over a period of five years from 2006 to 2010 across 8 countries. We find that the effect of these macroeconomic indicators varies over time, and most of this variation is present in the year preceding and succeeding the financial crisis. In addition, the trajectory of time-varying effects of GDP growth and inflation support the “flight to quality” hypothesis: cost of trade finance reduces in countries with high GDP growth and low inflation, during the crisis. The authors also note presence of country-specific heterogeneity in some of these effects. The authors propose extensions to the model and discuss its alternative uses in different contexts.","Mullick, Shantanu; Malshe, Ashwin; Glady, Nicolas",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274302/,478

However, the role of PST is increasingly questioned in the pediatric setting. To resolve the question of PST’s diagnostic accuracy, consecutive children with a history of non-life-threatening penicillin allergy referred to a tertiary-care allergy center were recruited to undergo double-blinded PST with PPL and BP prior to drug provocation to amoxicillin. Five of 158 participants (3.2%) presented with an immediate or accelerated reaction upon amoxicillin challenge, none of which were severe. Only one of these had positive PST (20%), compared to 15 of 153 amoxicillin tolerant participants (9.8%). The sensitivity and specificity of PST with PPL and BP for reacting upon amoxicillin challenge were 20% (95% CI: 0.5–71.6%) and 90% (95% CI: 84.4–94.4%), respectively. These results argue against the routine use of PST as a preliminary step to drug provocation with amoxicillin in this population, as it is unlikely to significantly alter pre-test probability of reacting to challenge.","Labrosse, Roxane; Paradis, Louis; Samaan, Kathryn; Lacombe-Barrios, Jonathan; Paradis, Jean; Bégin, Philippe; Des Roches, Anne",Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7371808/,478

Blanchard et al. (Are capital inflows expansionary or contractionary? Theory, policy implications, and some evidence. NBER Working Papers 21619, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA, 2015) showed that capital outflows from emerging markets can reduce output by increasing the cost of financial intermediation and can increase output by increasing net exports. Regression results indicate that Indonesian banks are exposed to depreciations, but that exports are not stimulated by depreciations. The findings also indicate that Indonesia’s export price index is positively correlated with commodity prices and negatively correlated with manufactured goods prices. Exporting more manufactures would reduce Indonesia’s exposure to volatile commodity prices and allow depreciations to stimulate exports. This paper considers several steps that Indonesia could take to increase its manufacturing exports.","Thorbecke, Willem",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471639/,478

This return to great power deterrence has brought widely acknowledged military challenges related to power projection, force modernization, and burden sharing but also and notably a political challenge of defining NATO’s collective political ambitions for a continental order in which Russia will not become like the West. Like during the Cold War, the most convincing posture for NATO has become one of deterrence by punishment, building on a fairly dynamic military ability to strike Russia at a point of choosing, as opposed to defending every entry point to Alliance territory. However, NATO, not sure of what political order it represents, struggles to read Russia’s political character and intent and size its military posture accordingly. NATO’s political deficit effectively robs it of a middle ground from where it can build its military posture and invest in its upkeep. In the 1960s, NATO forged such a middle ground as an essential platform for strategic adaptation; today, NATO’s full deterrence posture is suffering from the absence of such a middle ground. Thus, a comprehensive politico-military posture of deterrence vis-à-vis Russia will require NATO’s reengagement with its own political fundamentals.","Rynning, Sten",NL ARMS Netherlands Annual Review of Military Studies 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7711749/,478
44201,Corticosteroids for COVID-19-Associated ARDS,2020-12-30,"BACKGROUND: Over 8 million people have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). People living with HIV (PWH) affected by SARS-CoV-2 represent a small proportion of patients admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 disease. Viral dynamics in this subpopulation are still unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study from a large, urban academic center in New Haven, CT of patients consecutively admitted with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection through May 31, 2020. Main outcome measure was the ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load (VL) detected in respiratory samples by cycle threshold (Ct) values and trend over time as a measure of nucleic acid concentration and replication. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory results, ART treatment, COVID treatment and outcomes were abstracted from patient records. We evaluated the relationship between virologic data and disease severity. RESULTS: Among 19 PWH hospitalized with covid19, 84% were >50 years of age, 53% were women, 63% were black, 95% were on antiretrovirals, 95% with undetectable HIV VL (< 50 copies/ml), and median CD4 count of 827.9 cells/mm3. Symptom duration was 2–14 days. Median length of stay was 12 days. There was no in-hospital mortality. A total of 62 respiratory samples were collected at various time points and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load. Eight patients had 1 specimen. Patient with more severe disease had higher baseline SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. Mean Ct values for N1 and N2 on admission were 21.6 and 23.7, respectively. CONCLUSION: PWH with COVID19 represents only a small percentage of hospitalized patients and viral dynamics are not well defined. SARS-CoV-2 VL was higher among PWH with advanced disease at the presentation of illness. Overall, PWH with COVID-19 had favorable outcomes.

However, real-world datasets exhibit highly class-imbalanced distributions, yielding two main challenges: relative imbalance amongst the classes and data scarcity for mediumshot or fewshot classes. In this work, we address the problem of long-tailed recognition wherein the training set is highly imbalanced and the test set is kept balanced. Differently from existing paradigms relying on data-resampling, cost-sensitive learning, online hard example mining, loss objective reshaping, and/or memory-based modeling, we propose an ensemble of class-balanced experts that combines the strength of diverse classifiers. Our ensemble of class-balanced experts reaches results close to state-of-the-art and an extended ensemble establishes a new state-of-the-art on two benchmarks for long-tailed recognition. We conduct extensive experiments to analyse the performance of the ensembles, and discover that in modern large-scale datasets, relative imbalance is a harder problem than data scarcity.

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify risk prediction models for PPC following abdominal surgery. External validation was performed using data from a prospective dataset of adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery from January to April 2019 in the UK, Ireland and Australia. The primary outcome was identification of PPC within 30-days (StEP-COMPAC criteria definition). Model discrimination and diagnostic accuracy were compared. RESULTS: Six unique risk prediction models were eligible from 2819 records. These were validated across 11,591 patients, with an overall PPC rate of 7.8% (n = 903).

We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on general surgical services in a district general hospital. METHOD: Electronic health care record data was retrospectively collected from 6th of April to 6th of May for both 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: Despite fewer referrals and admissions in 2020 (133 vs 177 admissions in 2019), there were more failed discharges (29 vs 17 in 2019) and higher associated costs. Higher numbers of biliary related pathologies and pancreatitis (50 in 2020 vs 25 in 2019), and fewer complaints of non-specific abdominal pain (10 in 2020 vs 22 in 2019) were observed. The use of outpatient investigations decreased by approximately 40% in 2020; however, utilisation of inpatient investigations was comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Better utilisation of outpatient investigations and virtual clinic services may surmount pressures from further peaks of COVID-19. The increase in biliary related cases and pancreatitis may be consequent upon lifestyle changes during lockdown. This merits further investigation and if appropriate, public health intervention. In the absence of an efficacious vaccine, further research would be essential to streamline general surgical services based on clinical risk stratification.","Ahn, K; Khan, N; Desai, N; Abdu, M; Hiddema, L; Odogwu, S; Cheetham, M; Pande, R",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135730/,478

It is not uncommon that a trainee’s first experience of Urology is when they encounter urological patients as a clinician and studies have revealed that graduates are lacking knowledge and confidence in managing urological pathology. Many trainees across the world are unable to access vital learning resources to address this gap in knowledge due to exorbitant prices set by publishing companies. METHOD: To address the need for affordable standardised education, ‘Urology for Medical Students and Junior Doctors’ was created. This self-published eBook was written and peer-reviewed by urologists to create a relevant learning resource that is affordable for all.

53375,Home-based Cardiac Rehabilitation: the patients claim for new strategies but do they adhere?,2021-05-11,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in NHS surgical service provision. This, combined with the government-imposed lockdown, may have impacted on patient attendance, severity of surgical disease, and outcomes. This study aimed to investigate a possible ‘lockdown’ effect on the volume and severity of surgical admissions and outcomes. METHOD: Two cohorts of adult emergency general surgery admissions 30 days immediately before (16/2/2020 to 15/3/2020), and after UK government advice (16/3/2020 to 15/4/2020). Data were collected relating to patient characteristics, disease severity, clinical outcomes, and compared between these groups. RESULTS: Following lockdown, a significant reduction in median daily admissions from 7 to 3 (p < 0.001) was observed. Post-lockdown patients were significantly older, frailer with higher inflammatory indices and rates of AKI, and more likely to present with gastrointestinal cancer, obstruction, and perforation. Patients had significantly higher rates of Clavien-Dindo Grade ≥3 complications (p = 0.001), all-cause 30-day mortality (8.5% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.028), but no significant difference was observed in operative 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be a “lockdown” effect on general surgical admissions with fewer admissions, more acutely unwell patients, and an increase in all-cause 30-day mortality. Patients should be advised to present promptly, and this should be reinforced for future lockdowns during the pandemic.","McLean, R; Young, J; Musbahi, A; Lee, J X; Hidayat, H; Abdalla, N; Chowdhury, S; Baker, E; Etherson, K",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135742/,478
53387,One year after the dyslipidemia esc guidelines: which impact in a high cardiovascular risk population is shown?,2021-05-11,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to determine if patients with CHD are at a higher risk of poor outcomes if they have COVID-19, compared to those without CHD. METHOD: A systematic review was executed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. To identify articles related to COVID-19 and CHD, an extensive literature search was performed on EMBASE, Medline, Scopus and Global Health databases using keywords and MeSH terms. RESULTS: 12 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included for analysis in this systematic review. Two themes were identified for data extraction: [1] evidence supporting higher risks in CHD patients and [2] evidence against higher risks in CHD patients. After combining the data, there were 99 patients with CHDs out of which 12 required admission to ICU. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review suggests that CHD may increase the risk of poor outcomes for those with COVID-19, but also highlights the necessity for more research with larger sample sizes in order to make a more justified conclusion, as the majority of papers that were analysed were case series and case reports. Future research should aim to quantify the risks if possible while accounting for various confounding factors such as age and treatment history.","Haiduc, A; Ogunjimi, M; Shammus, R; Mahmood, S; Harky, A",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135769/,478

Chinese medicine therapies have been applied extensively in the treatment of NB, especially in China, and the results are promising but varying. Thus, the aim of this work is to assess the efficacy and safety of various Chinese medicine therapies for NB after SCI. METHODS: A retrieval will be performed in 8 online databases (the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE Database, China Biological Medicine Database, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, Wan Fang databases, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) from their inception throughout June 2021. Only randomized controlled trials of testing Chinese medicine therapies for NB after SCI will be enrolled. The outcome indicators measured will be overall response rate, urodynamic tests, clinical assessment, and safety assessments. The methodological quality of this Bayesian-based network meta-analysis will be conducted with the “Risk of Bias” tool. Stata14.0 and WinBUGS 1.4.3 will be used to analyze the data. Furthermore, the assessment of heterogeneity, inconsistency, subgroup, sensitivity, and publication bias will also be taken into consideration with the help of Cochrane Collaboration's tool. RESULTS: The findings of this study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. CONCLUSION: This work will furnish evidence-based recommendations to figure out the optimal Chinese medicine therapy or their combinations for NB induced by SCI, and in turn contribute to further research and public health.","Zhu, Zhihong; Zhuo, Yue; Jin, Haitao; Wu, Boyu; Li, Zhijie",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8447989/,478
58399,"COVID-19 in the endoscopy unit: How likely is transmission of infection? Results from an international, multicenter study",2021-09-16,"Hybrid learning spaces are often associated with ‘blended’ education and defined by the presence of a mediating technology. In this paper, we shift the focus from technology to practice in the search for a relationist perspective that understands hybrid space as emerging from a sociomaterial assemblage. In this perspective, learning and teaching involve blurred boundaries and spatiotemporal configurations in a context of radical uncertainty. The paper presents a qualitative study of an ongoing project called Teknosofikum, a course/concept for the professional development of novice higher-education teachers in Denmark. The project addresses the complexity of distributed learning in (post-)pandemic hybrid spaces and times. It aims at generating imaginative pedagogies through the use of technology while also nurturing ontological aspects of the teaching profession. The paper presents and discusses data from the first iteration, which included co-designed processes of prototype content development and a mini-trial with seven course participants. Two key findings about teacher professional development emerge from the study. The first is the need to focus on multiple and situated teaching activities, providing a bridge between learning theories and educational practices. The second is the importance of knowing-in-practice, rather than acquiring knowledge, to create space for imagination in teaching with technologies and face up to the dynamic evolution of higher education.","Pischetola, Magda",Postdigit Sci Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481934/,478

This shift can lead to tension due to differences in values both generations share, with parents prioritizing autonomy and self-sufficiency and adult children prioritizing safety and convention. Although a great deal of research on the transition from adolescence to adulthood focuses on governance transfer and changing boundaries of autonomy, monitoring, and control, less is known about how this happens in later life. The current study used qualitative methodology to explore the dynamic balance of autonomy, safety, and care between older parents and adult children who provide assistance in their daily lives. It focused on which areas adult children were most likely to monitor and try to control and how they did so, how parents respond to those efforts, and the dynamics of information management. Sixteen adult children who had at least one living parent (M(age) = 53, SD = 6.1) discussed the challenges of managing two conflicting caregiving goals: respecting parents’ autonomy and ensuring parents’ moral well-being, health, and safety. Data were analyzed using directive content analysis. Although participants were concerned about the negative consequences of their parents’ current behaviors and health conditions, they rarely impinged on their parents’ autonomy until they were prompted by an authority figure or had clear evidence that their parents’ health or safety were threatened. Parents often kept information about their activities and well-being from their children in order to protect their autonomy. Implications for balancing parents and adult children’s goals of governance transfer are discussed.","Toyokawa, Noriko; Darling, Nancy; Toyokawa, Teru",J Adult Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8503870/,478

According to the relational sociological perspective, each uncertainty process creates various changes on social networks and relationships, and these relational changes also affect identities, roles, and relational strategies. With this study, it is aimed to explore the economic, social, and familial impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on Syrian migrants’ lives in Turkey from a relational sociological perspective. The data in the study is obtained by semi-structured qualitative interviews with 13 Syrian citizens living in Mersin province of Turkey. According to the findings of the study, the suspension or slowdown of economic activities due to the pandemic has caused not only an uncertainty about the future, but also a change in familial positions and roles. Also the accepted norms of social relations have been inevitably suspended resulting in increased ambiguity. Strengthening the network of solidarity within relatives and building stronger relationships within the family are common relational strategies of the participants to mitigate the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, but these strategies will not be adequate if the lockdown process is prolonged. Considering the fact that the lockdown measures can be tightened again at any time, social and economic policies should be expanded to include the Syrian migrants in Turkey.","Babuç, Zeynep Tekin",J Int Migr Integr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8505110/,478

MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional randomized study was conducted in Moscow region from March to May 2020. Two groups were examined for EBV-markers: hospital patients (n = 95) treated for SARS-CoV-2 infection and blood donors (n = 92). RESULTS With equal EBV prevalence the detection of active infection markers in donors (10.9%) was noticeably lower than in SARS-CoV-2 patients (80%). Significant differences in this indicator were also found when patients from subgroups with interstitial pneumonia with the presence (96.6%) and absence (97.2%) of SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharyngeal smear were compared with the subgroup of patients with mild COVID-19 (43.3%). The average IgG VCA and IgG EBNA positivity coefficients in donor group were higher than in patient group (p < 0.05). Patients with active EBV infection markers were significantly more likely to have pneumonia, exceeding the reference values of ALT and the relative number of monocytes (odds ratio - 23.6; 3.5; 9.7, respectively). DISCUSSION The present study examined the incidence and analyzed epidemiological features of active EBV infection in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION A significantly higher rate of detection of active EBV infection markers in hospital patients indicates a combined participation SARS-CoV-2 and EBV in the development of interstitial pneumonia. Low levels of specific IgG EBV serve as predictors of EBV reactivation. Exceeding the reference values of ALT and the relative number of monocytes in patients should serve as a reason for examination for active EBV infection markers.","Solomay, T V; Semenenko, T A; Filatov, N N; Vedunova, S L; Lavrov, V F; Smirnova, D I; Gracheva, A V; Faizuloev, E B",Voprosy virusologii,https://doi.org/10.36233/0507-4088-40; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33993685/,478

However, precise mechanisms underlying the beneficial cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are not fully understood. This study investigated the effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor, luseogliflozin, on arterial properties and home blood pressure (BP) in patients with T2DM. This multicenter, single-arm study enrolled adults with T2DM, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 6.5%-8.9% in the previous 4 weeks, and an indication for new/additional antidiabetic therapy. Luseogliflozin 2.5 mg/d was given for 12 weeks. Primary outcome was change in cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) from baseline to Week 4 and Week 12. Home and office BP, BP variability, and metabolic parameters were secondary endpoints. Forty-seven patients (mean age 63.5 ± 10.7 years) treated with luseogliflozin were included in the full analysis set. CAVI did not change significantly from baseline (mean [95% confidence interval] 8.67 [8.37-8.97]) to Week 12 (8.64 [8.38-8.91]; P = .750), but there were significant reductions from baseline in morning home BP, HbA1c, body weight, body mass index, and serum uric acid levels during luseogliflozin therapy. The reduction in morning home systolic BP was ≥ 5 mm Hg and was independent of baseline BP and BP control status. In conclusion, there was no change in arterial stiffness (based on CAVI) during treatment with luseogliflozin, but changes in BP and metabolic parameters were consistent with the known beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in T2DM.","Kario, Kazuomi; Okada, Kenta; Murata, Mitsunobu; Suzuki, Daisuke; Yamagiwa, Kayo; Abe, Yasuhisa; Usui, Isao; Tsuchiya, Norihiro; Iwashita, Chie; Harada, Noriko; Okawara, Yukie; Ishibashi, Shun; Hoshide, Satoshi",Journal of clinical hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1111/jch.13988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810338/,478

PRESENTATION OF CASE We diagnosed the recurrent inguinal hernia after wound infection and performed the laparosocopic approach. We would like to introduce our method. We distinguished between the presence and absence of bilateral inguinal hernia with an intra-abdominal scope using the transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TAPP) technique, which we call laparoscopic examination. Thus, we can distinguish between the types of inguinal hernias and whether they are bilateral or not. We dissected the Retzius space on the inside of an epigastric arteriovenous fistula as part of TEP part A, and dissection was performed without a balloon. We separated and dissected the Retzius space. We also performed lateral dissection of the preperitoneal space. We made an incision in the peritoneum at the inner groin ring (hernia sac). We isolated the cord structures (parietalization) using TAPP. We finally checked this operation from the abdominal space (TAPP filed) and determined whether the repair was satisfactorily completed or not. DISCUSSION Our hybrid method is not special but the conventional laparoscopic approach adapted each merits both TAPP and TEP. CONCLUSION Our method is effective for difficult recurrent inguinal hernias.","Nitta, Toshikatsu; Kinoshita, Takashi; Kataoka, Jun; Ohta, Masato; Fujii, Kensuke; Ishibashi, Takashi",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2018.07.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30081319/,478
62272,Is It Time to Revisit Pediatric Postdischarge Home Visits for Readmissions Reduction?,2020-09-01,"The prevalence and seroconversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic health care workers in the US is unclear. Our study utilized real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 testing and serological evaluation to detect IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in asymptomatic health care workers. A total of 197 subjects with a mean age of 35 years were recruited into the study. While most (67%) reported prolonged contact with known COVID-19 patients, only 8 (4.2%) tested positive on RT-PCR and 23 (11.7%) had detectable levels of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2. Out of 19 subjects with detectable IgG antibody at week 1, 11 (57.9%) lost their antibody response by week 3. No statistically significant difference was found in baseline characteristics or exposure status between subjects with positive and negative results on RT-PCR or antibody positivity. In conclusion, we found a low incidence of PCR positivity for SARS-CoV-2 in a high-risk group. This likely demonstrates the effectiveness of proper personal protective equipment use and low transmission risk in health care settings. The detectable IgG antibody titer was low, and a significant portion of subjects lost their antibody response on repeat testing. This may mean that antibody response in asymptomatic patients is categorically different than in symptomatic hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Safder, Taimur; McCullough, Peter A; Wheelan, Kevin R; Rahimi, Gelareh; Zurawski, Sandra; Zurawski, Gerard; Gu, Jinghua; Wang, Xuan; Balaji, Uthra; Berhe, Mezgebe; Clariday, Laura; Baker, Rebecca; Chionh, Kristen; Carino, Giselle; Sandkovsky, Uriel S",Proceedings,https://doi.org/10.1080/08998280.2021.1895959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34219921/,478

Data were collected from patients who were confirmed to have critical cardiovascular disease and admitted to the CCU of the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Hunan, from January 23 to April 23, 2020. Compared with the same period in 2019, the results show that the number of hospitalization decreased by 19.6%; the inhospital mortality rate of CCU was decreased (28.57% versus 16.67%; odds ratio (OR), 0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.251-0.996; P = 0.047); hospital stay was decreased (7.97 versus 12.36, P < 0.001); hospital emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) rate in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) significantly decreased (76.00% versus 39.00%, P < 0.001); among this, the PCI rate of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) decreased (76.32% versus 55.17%, P = 0.028) as well. In addition, the number of patients transferred from other hospitals significantly decreased (76.79% versus 56.67%, P = 0.002), and the number of patients transferred from other cities also decreased by 10.75%.During the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hunan Province, the number of patients admitted to CCU decreased, as well as the mortality rate; fewer patients with severe cardiovascular disease can be transported to better hospitals from remote rural areas.

62338,Failing the frail: the need to broaden the COVID-19 case definition for geriatric patients.,2021-03-01,"Canada has a long tradition of leading practice-changing clinical trials in oncology. Here, we describe methodology, results, and interpretation of oncology RCTs with Canadian involvement compared to RCTs from other high-income countries (HICs). A literature search identified all RCTs evaluating anti-cancer therapies published 2014-2017. RCTs were classified based on the country affiliation of first authors. The study cohort included 636 HIC-led RCTs; 155 (24%) had Canadian authors. Three-quarters (112/155, 72%) of Canadian RCTs were conducted in the palliative setting, compared to two thirds (299/481, 62%) of RCTs from other HICs (p = 0.022). Canadian RCTs were more likely than those from other HICs to be supported by industry (85% vs. 69%, p < 0.001). The proportion of positive Canadian trials that met the ESMO-MCBS threshold for substantial clinical benefit was comparable to RCTs without Canadian authors (29% vs. 32%, p = 0.137). Thirteen percent (20/155) of all Canadian trials were affiliated with the Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG). Canada plays a meaningful role in the global cancer research ecosystem but is overly reliant on industry support. The very low proportion of trials that identify a new treatment with substantial clinical benefit is worrisome. A renewed investment in cancer clinical trials is needed in Canada.","Sharma, Shubham; Wells, J Connor; Hopman, Wilma M; Del Paggio, Joseph C; Gyawali, Bishal; Hammad, Nazik; Hay, Annette E; Booth, Christopher M",Current oncology,https://doi.org/10.3390/curroncol28020143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33924380/,478

Unlike conventional directed self-assembly methods, trench-directed self-assembly enables the achievement of neutral surface-free vertical orientations of the block copolymer nanopatterns irrespective of the polarizability of the substrate, which may be, for example, a ceramic (SiO2) on Semiconductor (Si). In our demonstration of the proposed method, we generated various morphologies of the block copolymer nanopatterns by varying the trench width, and molecular weight of the block copolymer. The proposed trench-directed self-assembly method is potentially advantageous for the design of a process/device layout required for the development of an effective manufacturing process.","신, 진용; Lee, Bom; Lim, Heo Yeon; Kim, Simon; Jeong, Seong-Jun",Nanotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/abbbb3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977315/,478

65588,Covid-19: US will send 60 million AstraZeneca doses abroad as domestic demand falls.,2021-04-28,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Endovascular treatment (EVT) is a new standard of care for selected, large vessel occlusive strokes. We aimed to determine frequency of potentially eligible patients for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and EVT in comprehensive stroke centers. In addition, predictors of EVT eligibility were derived. METHODS Patients from a stroke center-based registry (2003-2014), admitted within 24 hours of last proof of usual health, were selected if they had all data to determine IVT and EVT eligibility according to American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines (class I-IIa recommendations). Moreover, less restrictive criteria adapted from randomized controlled trials and clinical practice were tested. Maximum onset-to-door time windows for IVT eligibility were 3.5 hours (allowing door-to-needle delay of ≤60 minutes) and 4.5 hours for EVT eligibility (door-to-groin delay ≤90 minutes). Demographic and clinical information were used in logistic regression analysis to derive variables associated with EVT eligibility. RESULTS A total of 2704 patients with acute ischemic stroke were included, of which 26.8% were transfers. Of all patients with stroke arriving at our comprehensive stroke center, a total proportion of 12.4% patients was eligible for IVT. Frequency of EVT eligibility differed between AHA/ASA guidelines and less restrictive approach: 2.9% versus 4.9%, respectively, of all patients with acute ischemic stroke and 10.5% versus 17.7%, respectively, of all patients arriving within <6 hours. Predictors for AHA-EVT eligibility were younger, shorter onset-to-admission delays, higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), decreased vigilance, hemineglect, absent cerebellar signs, atrial fibrillation, smoking, and decreasing glucose levels (area under the curve=0.86). CONCLUSIONS Of patients arriving within 6 hours at a comprehensive stroke center, 10.5% are EVT eligible according to AHA/ASA criteria, 17.7% according to criteria resembling randomized controlled trials, and twice as many patients are IVT eligible (36.2%).","Vanacker, Peter; Lambrou, Dimitris; Eskandari, Ashraf; Mosimann, Pascal J; Maghraoui, Ali; Michel, Patrik",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.012577; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27301945/,478

66576,Venous thromboembolism in the era of COVID-19.,2020-09-10,"BACKGROUND A significant proportion of patients with aortic stenosis (AS) have discordance in severity by mean gradient/peak velocity and aortic valve area. Low gradient aortic stenosis (LG-AS) is defined when the aortic valve area is < 1 cm2 consistent with severe AS and mean aortic gradient is < 40 mmHg consistent with non-severe AS. LG-AS represents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. PURPOSE OF REVIEW To summarize the different categories, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of LG-AS. LG-AS is classified as classical (ejection fraction (EF) < 50%, indexed stroke volume (SVi) < 35 ml/m2), paradoxical (EF > 50%, SVi < 35 ml/m2), pseudo-severe (moderate AS with reduced EF), or normal flow low gradient AS. RECENT FINDINGS Recent findings emphasize the importance of low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography and CT calcium score in the assessment of aortic valve. In addition, flow reserve (increase in SV > 50%) can be evaluated during dobutamine stress echocardiography and helps predict perioperative prognosis. Patients with LG-AS have better survival with aortic valve replacement (AVR) compared to medical therapy, irrespective of presence or absence of flow reserve. Some recent studies suggest that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may be superior to surgical AVR for patients with a lack of contractile flow reserve or those with paradoxical LG-AS, but further investigation is needed to clarify optimal treatment. The role of TAVR in patients with moderate AS and reduced EF is also under investigation.","Anand, Vidhu; Mankad, Sunil V; Eleid, Mackram",Current cardiology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11886-020-01341-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648081/,478

67546,Spectrum of Neurological Manifestations in Covid-19: A Review.,2020,"BACKGROUND The first wave of the COVID-19-pandemic hit different countries with varying degrees of severity, so that differences in the type and level of emergency measures were also necessary. It can be assumed that the psychological burden was higher in countries subjected to a more severe course of the pandemic (Italy) than in countries subjected to a less severe one (Germany, Austria). OBJECTIVE To investigate and contrast the wellbeing of the population in Italy, Austria, and Germany in the early phase of the first lockdown. METHOD Online survey on N = 4289 individuals. The questionnaire comprised a self-administered section, exploring the dimensions: perceived severity of COVID-19, perceived risk of disease, concerns related to COVID-19, emergency measure acceptance and emotional distress due to emergency measures; and standardized scales to record emotional state and coping: Stress-Coping-Style Questionnaire, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory. RESULTS The three countries displayed significant differences in all investigated dimensions (p < .001). Italian participants assessed the COVID-19 virus as much more dangerous (p < .001), but despite the prevalence of the virus, the subjective risk of disease was perceived to be lower in Italy (p < .001). This could be a positive effect of the restrictive curfews set by the government in Italy. The emergency measures were generally perceived to be very effective in all three countries, but due to the duration and the severity of the measures, the fear and stress-reaction were the strongest among Italian participants (p < .001). CONCLUSION The stricter measures in Italy prevented an application of many positive stress processing strategies, which, in turn, fostered the perpetuation of stresses and fear.","Eichenberg, Christiane; Grossfurthner, Martin; Kietaibl, Sibylle; Riboli, Greta; Borlimi, Rosita; Holocher-Benetka, Stefana",BMC psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03505-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34654389/,478

A CRC predictive model can be used as an effective method to provide an appropriate treatment for CRC patients. Methods A total of 34 CRC patients were enrolled in this study. After performing 1000-gene panel targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS), high-frequency mutation genes were screened, and their functional terms and pathways were enriched. In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) CRC cases, the risk factors for overall survival (OS) were screened by univariate and multivariate analysis, and a predictive model was constructed and verified. Subsequently, the relationship among mutation status, gene expression, methylation level, and OS was analyzed to explore the molecular mechanism of CRC progression. Results A total of 26 high-frequency mutation genes were screened, which were mainly enriched in breast cancer and proteoglycans in cancer pathways. The clinical parameters of age, stage, recurrence and metastasis, the mutation status of APC, BRCA2, CDH1, SMO, and TSC2 were identified as risk factors for the construction of the predictive model. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.734, 0.754, 0.774, and 0.74 for 1-, 3-, 5- and 7-year survival in the model group, respectively. Conclusions We identified several mutated genes and clinical parameters affecting OS and established a model to better predict the OS of CRC patients.","Zheng, Lei; Zhan, Yang; Lu, Jia; Hu, Jun; Kong, Dalu",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-21-1010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33987378/,478

The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa entered its second year and is unprecedented because it is the largest one in history, involved urban centers and affected a large number of health care workers. It quickly escalated from medical into a humanitarian, social, economic, and security crisis. The primary pillars to prevent EVD are: early diagnosis, isolation of patients, contact tracing and monitoring, safe burials, infection prevention and control and social mobilization. The implementation of all these components was challenged in the field. Key lessons from this Ebola outbreak are that countries with weak health care systems can't withstand the major outbreaks; preparedness to treat the first confirmed cases is a national emergency; all control measures must be coordinated together and community engagement is the great factor to combat this disease.","Raka, Lul; Guardo, Monica",Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.3889/oamjms.2015.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27275217/,478

The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting stay-at-home orders in the United States have created an optimal situation for the use of telehealth services for non-life-threatening health care use. A retrospective cohort study was performed using Kantar's Claritis™ database, which links insurance claims encounters (Komodo Health) with patient-reported data (Kantar Health, National Health & Wellness Survey). Logistic regression models (odds ratios [OR], 95% confidence intervals [CI]) examined predictors of telehealth versus in-person encounters. Adults ages ≥18 years eligible for payer-complete health care encounters in both March 2019 and March 2020 were identified (n = 35,376). Telehealth use increased from 0.2% in 2019 to 1.9% in 2020. In adjusted models of respondents with ≥1 health care encounter (n = 11,614), age, marital status, geographic residence (region; urban/rural), and presence of anxiety or depression were significant predictors of telehealth compared with in-person use in March 2020. For example, adults 45-46 years versus 18-44 years were less likely to use telehealth (OR 0.684, 95% CI: 0.561-0.834), and respondents living in urban versus rural areas were more likely to use telehealth (OR 1.543, 95% CI: 1.153-2.067). Substantial increases in telehealth use were observed during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States; however, disparities existed. These inequalities represent the baseline landscape that population health management must monitor and address during this pandemic.","Jaffe, Dena H; Lee, Lulu; Huynh, Stephanie; Haskell, Thomas P",Population health management,https://doi.org/10.1089/pop.2020.0186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32816644/,478

The determinant for such variation remains poorly understood. This study documented the activity of influenza over a 10-year period in Hong Kong; examining its association with changes in temperature and relative humidity. The two types of influenza exhibited different correlations with meteorological variations. Influenza A showed two seasonal peaks occurring respectively in winter/spring and summer months in most years. Influenza B showed a clear winter/spring peak, but its activity during summer months was more variable. Cold and humid conditions were associated with a higher activity of both influenza A and B. In contrast, hot and humid conditions were associated with a higher activity of influenza A, but were associated with only a moderate, less consistent increase in the activity of influenza B. A trend of increase in the magnitude of summer peaks of influenza A, but not influenza B, was observed. A hypothetical 2 degrees C rise in temperature would decrease the proportion of favorable days for influenza A in December-April from 78% to 57%, but an increase from 58% to 71% in May-November; with a similar effect (from 83% to 62%) for influenza B during December-April, but a modest change (from 17% to 18%) during May-November. The presence of two seasonal peaks of influenza annually emphasizes the need to evaluate the duration of protective immunity offered by vaccination.

Among them, norovirus was the main pathogenic factor in the cause of gastroenteritis and foodborne illness, of which the GII.4 and GII.17 genotypes are prevalent in China and most parts of the world. A simple and low-cost platform for rapid and accurate norovirus detection remains a major challenge. After the cell-free system and paper-based chromogenic system were optimized, a rapid and specific norovirus detection method was established based on norovirus-specific sequences in combination with toehold switch elements. The development of a visible color change during detection eliminates the need for any complicated instruments. We validated this strategy and its specificity in differentiating GII.4, GII.17, Zika virus, and human coronavirus HKU1. The results showed that the optimized detection system not only provided a simple and rapid detection method for the sufficient differentiation of the two norovirus genotypes but also showed high specificity and no cross-reactivity with other viruses. Using nucleic acid isothermal amplification, this assay showed a limit of detection of 0.5 pM for the GII.4 genotype and 2.6 fM for the GII.17 genotype in reactions that could be observed directly with the naked eye.

Thereafter, laparoscopic surgeons have attempted to improve cosmesis using single port surgery. This study aims to introduce and assess the safety and feasibility of single port laparoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) hernia repair with a nearly-scarless umbilical incision. METHODS Sixty three single port laparoscopic TEP hernia repairs were performed in sixty patients from June 2010 to March 2011 at Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, with the use of a glove single-port device and standard laparoscopic instruments. Demographic and clinical data, intraoperative findings, and postoperative course were reviewed. RESULTS Of the 63 hernias treated, 31 were right inguinal hernias, 26 were left inguinal hernias and 3 were both inguinal hernias. There was one conversion to conventional three port laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernioplasty. Mean operative time was 62 minutes (range, 32 to 150 minutes). There were no intraoperative complications. Postoperative complications occurred in two cases (wound seroma and urinary retension) and were successfully treated conservatively. Mean hospital stay was 2.15 days. CONCLUSION Single port laparoscopic TEP hernia repair is safe and feasible. Umbilical incision provides an excellent cosmetic outcome.

A decade ago, we discovered that interferons also play an important role in the biology of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are responsible for lifelong blood production. Though we have learned a great deal about the role of interferons on HSC quiescence, differentiation, and self-renewal, there remains some controversy regarding how interferons impact these stem cells, with differing conclusions depending on experimental models and clinical context. Here, we review the contradictory roles of Type 1 and 2 interferons in hematopoiesis. Specifically, we highlight the roles of interferons in embryonic and adult hematopoiesis, along with short-term and long-term adaptive and maladaptive responses to inflammation. We discuss experimental challenges in the study of these powerful yet short-lived cytokines and strategies to address those challenges. We further review the contribution by interferons to disease states including bone marrow failure and aplastic anemia as well as their therapeutic use to treat myeloproliferative neoplasms and viral infections, including SARS-CoV2. Understanding the opposing effects of interferons on hematopoiesis will elucidate immune responses and bone marrow failure syndromes, and future therapeutic approaches for patients undergoing HSC transplantation or fighting infectious diseases and cancer.","Demerdash, Yasmin; Kain, Bailee; Essers, Marieke A G; King, Katherine Y",Experimental hematology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exphem.2021.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33571568/,478

We reviewed and graded the research evidence with potential clinical application. We conducted a modified Delphi consensus among experienced colonoscopists on definitions and practice of WI, WE and UWR. METHODS Major data bases were searched to obtain research reports that could potentially shape clinical practice related to WAC and UWR. Pertinent references were graded (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Extracted data supporting evidence-based Statements were tabulated and provided to respondents. We received responses from 55 (85% surveyed) experienced colonoscopists (37 experts and 18 nonexperts in WAC) from 16 countries in 3 rounds. Voting was conducted anonymously in the second and third round, with ≥80% agreement defined as consensus. We aimed to obtain consensus in all Statements. RESULTS In the first and the second modified Delphi rounds, 20 proposed statements were decreased to 14 then 11 statements. After the third round, the combined responses from all respondents depicted the consensus in 11 Statements (S): definitions of WI (S1) and WE (S2), procedural features (S3-S5), impact on bowel cleanliness (S6), adenoma detection (S7), pain score (S8), and UWR (S9- S11). CONCLUSIONS The most important consensus Statements are that WI and WE are not the same in implementation and outcomes. Because studies that could potentially shape clinical practice of WAC and UWR were chosen for review, this modified Delphi consensus supports recommendations for the use of WAC in clinical practice.","Cadoni, Sergio; Ishaq, Sauid; Hassan, Cesare; Falt, Přemysl; Fuccio, Lorenzo; Siau, Keith; Leung, Joseph W; Anderson, John; Binmoeller, Kenneth F; Radaelli, Franco; Rutter, Matt D; Sugimoto, Shinya; Muhammad, Humayun; Leung, Felix W",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.10.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069706/,478

This study aimed to compare outcomes following laparoscopic versus open gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma at a Western center. METHODS Eighty-seven consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy from November 2005 to April 2013 were compared with 87 patients undergoing open resection during the same time period. Patients were matched for age, stage, body mass index, and procedure (distal subtotal vs. total gastrectomy). Endpoints were short- and long-term perioperative outcomes. RESULTS Overall, 65 patients (37 %) had locally advanced disease, and 40 (23 %) had proximal tumors. The laparoscopic approach was associated with longer operative time (median 240 vs.165 min; p < 0.01), less blood loss (100 vs.150 mL; p < 0.01), higher rate of microscopic margin positivity (9 vs.1 %; p = 0.04), decreased duration of narcotic and epidural use (2 vs. 4 days, p = 0.04, and 3 vs. 4 days, p = 0.02, respectively), decreased minor complications in the early (27 vs. 16 %) and late (17 vs. 7 %) postoperative periods (p < 0.01), decreased length of stay (5 vs. 7 days; p = 0.01), and increased likelihood of receiving adjuvant therapy (82 vs. 51 %; p < 0.01). There was no difference in the number of lymph nodes retrieved (median 20 in both groups), major morbidity, or 30-day mortality.

The aim of this review is to explore the literature, summarize potential predisposing factors to secondary infections and their incidence. It also summarizes a variety of healthcare scenarios in which different kinds of secondary infections occur. RECENT FINDINGS Apart from immune dysregulation, severe resource limitations in healthcare settings have made COVID-19 units conducive to a variety of secondary infections. Long-term effect of excess antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients is yet to be studied. Very few studies have assessed secondary infections as the primary outcome measure making it difficult to know the true incidence. Mortality attributable to secondary infections in COVID-19 patients is also unclear. SUMMARY Incidence of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients is likely higher than what is reported in the literature. Well designed studies are needed to understand the incidence and impact of secondary infections in this patient population. Many of these may be preventable especially now, as personal protective equipment and other healthcare resources are recovering. Infection prevention and control (IPC) and antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASP) must reassess current situation to correct any breaches that could potentially cause more harm in these already vulnerable patients as we brace for a future surge with another pandemic wave.","Sopirala, Madhuri M",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34039879/,478

METHODS Two consecutive 35-year-old patients with POP, who wished to preserve the uterus, underwent hysteropromontopexy by robotic surgery. RESULTS Both procedures were performed successfully using a robotic approach. No additional reconstructive procedures were thought to be necessary at the end of surgery. Neither intra- nor post-operative complications occurred. After a follow-up of 18 and 6 months for case 1 and 2, respectively, both patients declared themselves satisfied with the anatomical and functional results achieved.

76021,Assessing Brain Capillaries in Coronavirus Disease 2019.,2021-02-12,"Highly contagious Newcastle disease (ND) is associated with devastating outbreaks with highly variable clinical signs among gallinaceous birds. In this study we aimed to verify clinical ND suspicions in poultry holdings in Egypt suffering from respiratory distress and elevated mortality, comparing two groups of ND-vaccinated poultry holdings in three governorates. Besides testing for Newcastle disease virus (NDV), samples were screened for infectious bronchits virus (IBV) and avian influenza virus (AIV) by RT-qPCR as well as by non-directed cell-culture approach on LMH-cells. Virulent NDV was confirmed only in group A (n = 16) comprising small-scale holdings. Phylogenetic analysis of the fusion protein gene of 11 NDV-positive samples obtained from this group assigned all viruses to genotype 2.VIIb and point to four different virus populations that were circulating at the same time in one governorate, indicating independent epidemiological events. In group B, comprising large commercial broiler farms (n = 10), virulent NDV was not present, although, in six farms NDV vaccine type virus (genotype 2.II) was detected. Besides, in both groups, co-infections by IBV (n = 8), AIV H9 (n = 3) and/or avian reovirus (ARV) (n = 5) and avian astrovirus (AastVs) (n = 1) could be identified. Taken together, the study confirmed clinical ND suspicion in small scale holdings, pointing to inefficient vaccination practice in this group A. However, it also highlighted that even in an endemic situation like ND in Egypt, in cases of suspected ND vaccine failure, clinical ND suspicion has to be verified by pathotype-specific diagnostic tests.","Moharam, Ibrahim; Razik, Alaa Abd El; Sultan, Hesham; Ghezlan, Mohammed; Meseko, Clement; Franzke, Kati; Harder, Timm; Beer, Martin; Grund, Christian",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2019.1612852; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31090444/,478

77277,Temporizing management of pediatric femur fractures using J-splints.,2012,"This report describes the identification of a novel linear B-cell epitope at the N-terminus of the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) nucleocapsid (N) protein. A monoclonal antibody designated 2D2 was prepared against the IBV N protein, and a series of 23 partially overlapping, tagged fragments of the IBV N gene were expressed. These peptides and five heterogeneous IBV strains were used to identify the epitope recognized by 2D2 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting analysis. The linear motif (11)DSPAPIIKLGG(21), located at the N-terminus of the N protein, was identified as the epitope bound by 2D2. ELISA and Western blotting also showed that this epitope was recognized by IBV-positive chicken serum. We propose that this motif is a linear B-cell epitope of N protein, and is the core sequence for reactivity, as demonstrated by binding of 2D2 to the truncated peptides and different IBV strains. Alignment and comparison of the 2D2-defined epitope with other coronavirus sequences showed that the epitope is conserved among avian coronaviruses. The identified epitope might be useful for clinical applications and as a tool for further study of the structure and function of the IBV N protein.","Yu, Dan; Han, Zongxi; Xu, Jia; Shao, Yuhao; Li, Huixin; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang",Viral immunology,https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2009.0094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20373999/,478

77561,Does vitamin D deficiency increase the severity of COVID-19?,2020-06-05,"BACKGROUND Improving timely access in primary care is a continued challenge in many countries. We used positive deviance to try and identify best practices for achieving timely access in our primary care organisation in Toronto, Canada. METHODS Semistructured interviews were used to identify practice strategies used by physicians who successfully maintained a low third next available appointment (TNA) (positive deviants, n=6). We then conducted a cross-sectional survey to understand the prevalence of identified promising practices among all physicians (n=70) in the practice. We used χ2 testing to understand whether uptake of promising practices among survey respondents was different for those with a median TNA of 7 days or less vs a median TNA over 7 days. RESULTS We identified seven promising practice strategies used by positive deviants: adjusting the appointment template based on demand; reviewing the appointment schedule in advance; max-packing of visits; using phone, email and secure messaging; customising care for complex patients; managing planned absences; and involving the interprofessional team. 65 of 70 physicians responded to the survey on promising practices. Uptake of the promising practices was variable among survey respondents. In general, we found no association between uptake of promising practices and median TNA. One exception was that those with a median TNA of 7 or less were more likely to review the schedule in advance to potentially mitigate a visit using phone/email (62% vs 31%, p=0.0159). CONCLUSION Promising practices used by a small group of physicians ('positive deviants') to maintain good access were generally not associated with timely access among a larger sample of physicians in the practice. Our findings highlight the difficulty of untangling physician practice style and its contribution to timely access in primary care.","DeRocher, MaryBeth; Davie, Sam; Kiran, Tara",BMJ open quality,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2020-001228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34649853/,478

Understanding causal pathways linking participation with other population characteristics may be aided by identifying how relationships between the two patterns vary across different localities, and such knowledge may also inform decisions regarding geographical targeting of screening promotion efforts. In this analysis, models calibrated using multiscale geographically weighted regression enabled the assessment of spatial variations of determinants of screening participation levels. The models were calibrated for localities across west central Scotland (n=409), where participation levels were relatively low, using aggregated individual-level screening records within a two-year window (2009-2011). Area deprivation was found to have a strong negative impact on participation levels across the study area, and ethnic population concentration had a significant impact on male participation levels on localities within Glasgow city. Estimates of local intercepts pointed to a systemic difference in screening participation between the two health board regions in the study area. Overall the results suggest that work to increase screening participation was necessary. They also suggest that barriers to participation could be addressed locally, and that differences between health board regions required further investigation.","Geddes, Alistair; Fotheringham, A Stewart; Libby, Gillian; Steele, Robert J C",Geospatial health,https://doi.org/10.4081/gh.2021.967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34000795/,478

RPSA has reduced postprocedural pain and morbidity with shorter recovery time for the patient compared with EVLA using bare-tip fibers. However, new-generation EVLA devices with less traumatic radial-tip fibers (RTFs) operating at longer wavelengths up to 1470 nm also reduce postprocedural pain. The objective of this study was to compare long-term effectiveness of GSV thermal ablation and postprocedural recovery using RPSA or 1470-nm EVLA with RTF (EVLA-RTF). METHODS In a comparative prospective monthly altering-treatment cohort study of 311 patients (346 treated legs), each leg with incompetence of the GSV was treated with either RPSA (158 patients, 175 legs) or EVLA-RTF (153 patients, 171 legs). The primary outcome was anatomic occlusion of the GSV, assessed at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months using Kaplan-Meier statistics and compared using the log-rank test. Secondary outcomes included freedom of varicose vein recurrence, clinical success measured by Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), disease-specific quality of life determined using the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), postoperative pain scores, and time to return to work. RESULTS The total primary obliteration rate after 36 and 60 months was 96.2% with RPSA and 96.7% with EVLA-RTF (P = .81). Freedom of symptomatic anterior accessory vein recurrence after 5 years was 85% after RPSA and 87% after EVLA-RTF (P = .50). VCSS and AVVQ score presented similar and durable improvements in both groups between 6 weeks and 60 months. There was no difference in postoperative pain scores after both treatments during the first 14 days (mean visual analog scale score, 0.54-2.19). The median time for return to work was 1 day after both treatments. No severe adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS RPSA and EVLA-RTF have similarly high GSV obliteration rates in the long term, and the treatments are equally effective clinically. Both treatments are associated with similar minimal postprocedural pain scores and short recovery times.","Lawson, James A; Gauw, Stefanie A; van Vlijmen, Clarissa J; Pronk, Pascal; Gaastra, Menno T W; Tangelder, Marco J; Mooij, Michael C",Journal of vascular surgery.

COS are determined by consensus amongst key stakeholders, including health professionals, policymakers and patients, ensuring that the priorities and expertise of these representatives inform the choice of the most important outcomes to measure for a given condition. There is increased recognition of the need to integrate COS across the healthcare system and with existing regulatory apparatus, to ensure that outcomes being recorded are those of key relevance to important stakeholders. The aim of this study is to assess the degree of concordance between outcomes recommended in COS for research and in guidance provided by two key regulators: US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Methods: COS for research published during 2015-2019 with patient involvement and covering drug or device interventions will be compared against relevant regulatory guidelines, matched by condition. Guidance documents matching in scope (relating to intervention and population) to a COS for research will be scrutinised to identify all suggested outcomes for comparison against the core outcomes in the corresponding COS. Discussion: This study will identify variation between outcomes suggested in FDA and EMA regulatory guidance relative to outcomes included in published COS for research, thus demonstrating the degree of representation of COS in regulatory guidance and vice versa. We will share the study findings (in particular, highlighting any lack of concordance between COS and regulatory guidance overall or for particular disease areas) and will invite feedback from FDA and EMA; we will seek to highlight where findings support the recommendations towards using well-developed COS or will make recommendations to COS developers on outcomes of importance to these key regulators.","Dodd, Susanna; Fish, Rebecca; Gorst, Sarah; Hall, Deborah; Jacobsen, Pamela; Kirkham, Jamie; Main, Barry; Matvienko-Sikar, Karen; Saldanha, Ian J; Trépel, Dominic; Williamson, Paula R",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13139.3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34368618/,478

83167,Fracture Surgery in Known COVID-19 Infected Patients: What Are the Challenges?,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND Bone is a plastic tissue that is responsive to its physical environment. As a result, exercise interventions represent a potential means to influence the bone. However, little is currently known about how various exercise and participant characteristics interact to influence bone metabolism. Acute, controlled, interventions provide an in vivo model through which the acute bone response to exercise can be investigated, typically by monitoring circulating bone biomarkers. Currently, substantial heterogeneity in factors such as study design, quality, exercise, and participant characteristics render it difficult to synthesize and evaluate the available evidence. Using a systematic review and meta-analytic approach, the aim of this investigation is to quantify the effect of an acute exercise bout on circulating bone biomarkers as well as examine the potential factors that may moderate this response, e.g., variation in participant, exercise, and sampling characteristics. METHODS This protocol was designed in accordance with the PRISMA-P guidelines. Seven databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Sport Discus, Cochrane CENTRAL, PEDro, LILACS, and Ibec) will be systematically searched and supplemented by a secondary screening of the reference lists of all included articles. The PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes and Study Design) approach was used to guide the determination of the eligibility criteria. Participants of any age, sex, training, or health status will be considered for inclusion. We will select studies that have measured the bone biomarker response before and after an acute exercise session. All biomarkers considered to represent the bone metabolism will be considered for inclusion, and sensitivity analyses will be conducted using reference biomarkers for the measurement of bone resorption and formation (namely β-CTX-1 and P1NP). Multi-level, meta-regression models within a Bayesian framework will be used to explore the main effect of acute exercise on bone biomarkers as well as potential moderating factors. The risk of bias for each individual study will be evaluated using a modified version of the Downs and Black checklist while certainty in resultant outcomes will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. DISCUSSION A better understanding of the bone metabolic response to an acute bout of exercise has the potential to advance our understanding of the mechanisms through which this stimulus impacts bone metabolism, including factors that may moderate this response. Additionally, we will identify current gaps in the evidence base and provide recommendations to inform future research.

It is necessary for virtual biobanks to upload imaging data from those patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Standardized, collected information will be essential in the area of discovery and validation of disease markers as well as novel therapeutic strategies. It is essential for biobanks to collect COVID-19 specimens along with corresponding clinical and demographic data from COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Because COVID-19 is an acute respiratory illness, proper collection procedures must be in place to collect respiratory samples for biobanking purposes. A preconfigured purpose-built COVID-19 Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) is an efficient tool to seamlessly manage a data sharing network. Data entered into LIMS will be beneficial in designing much needed clinical trials to address any unmet needs to better address clinical treatment and outcomes. The partners or entities associated with the COVID-19 data sharing network will be able to effectively communicate, view data, and images associated with their respective research interest to advance COVID-19 research and data driven, clinical care.","Paul, Shonali; Chatterjee, Mrinal Kanti",Biopreservation and biobanking,https://doi.org/10.1089/bio.2020.0040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32833506/,478

84248,Formal guidelines: management of acute respiratory distress syndrome.,2019,"BACKGROUND Serum and synovial markers used to diagnose lower extremity prosthetic joint infection (PJI) have performed poorly for shoulder PJI. As a result, diagnosis is commonly reliant on the accuracy of positive or negative cultures. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can sequence an entire bacterial genome. This study was conducted to determine the correlation between NGS and routine cultures in revision shoulder arthroplasty. METHODS All patients undergoing revision shoulder arthroplasty were prospectively enrolled. In a standardized manner, tissue samples were transferred immediately into sterile specimen containers and transported for culture and NGS (MicroGen Dx, Lubbock, TX, USA). Infection definitions using culture and NGS were analyzed for concordance. RESULTS There were 44 total revision arthroplasty cases included. There were no cases of polymicrobial culture results. Cutibacterium (formerly Propionibacterium) acnes was the most common bacterial species cultured (8 of 13 [61.5%]) and identified by NGS (12 of 17 [70.1%]) in cases of definite and probable infection. The concordance (κ) between the 2 diagnostic criteria for defining infection that included culture or NGS was 0.333 (fair). There were significantly more cases of probable contaminants when cultures (10 of 44 [22.7%]) were used in the definition of infection compared with NGS (0 of 44 [0%]; P = .001). DISCUSSION Culture data from revision shoulder arthroplasty cases commonly yields monomicrobial results; whereas, NGS data suggests that bacterial loads in revision arthroplasty are most commonly polymicrobial. In addition, a definition of infection that uses cultures is more prone to ""probable contaminants"" than NGS. Significant uncertainty remains about our current methods of diagnosing shoulder PJI.","Namdari, Surena; Nicholson, Thema; Abboud, Joseph; Lazarus, Mark; Ramsey, Matthew L; Williams, Gerald; Parvizi, Javad",Journal of shoulder and elbow surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jse.2018.08.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30551780/,478

87063,Atypical course of COVID-19 in patient with Bruton agammaglobulinemia.,2020-11-30,"PURPOSE This study was designed to assess the role of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the multimodality management of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) in patients undergoing targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (TKI) for liver metastases. METHODS Outcomes of 17 patients who underwent liver RFA for 27 metastatic GIST after TKI therapy, from January 2004 to March 2012, were retrospectively analyzed. Mean maximum tumor diameter was 2.5 ± 1 cm (range 0.9-4.5 cm). In seven patients (group A), RFA of all residual tumors was performed, with curative intent, and TKI therapy was discontinued. In five patients (group B), RFA of all residual tumors was performed upon achieving the best morphological response with TKI therapy, which was maintained after RFA. In another five patients (group C), RFA was performed on individual liver metastases which were progressive under TKI therapy. RESULTS All 27 targeted tumors were completely ablated, without local recurrence during the mean follow-up period of 49 months. No major complications occurred. Two minor complications were reported (11 %). Only two patients (both in group C) died at 20 and 48 months. Two-year progression-free survival (PFS) after RFA was 29 % in group A, 75 % in group B, and 20 % in group C. CONCLUSIONS RFA in patients, previously treated with TKI, is feasible and safe. Our data suggest that RFA is a useful therapeutic option in patients with metastatic GIST and should be performed at the time of best clinical response with patient maintained under TKI after the procedure.","Hakimé, Antoine; Le Cesne, Axel; Deschamps, Frederic; Farouil, Geoffroy; Boudabous, Sana; Aupérin, Anne; Domont, Julien; Debaere, Thierry",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-013-0615-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23589213/,478
87647,What's New in Adult Reconstructive Knee Surgery.,2016,"OBJECTIVES Reports of patient injuries associated with videolaryngoscopy are increasing in the literature. There are a wide variety of opinions regarding both safe use of the device and patient care following aerodigestive tract injury. We have seen an increase in videolaryngoscopy-associated injuries in recent years at our institution. Because of this, we wanted to determine if video-assisted laryngoscopy presents a greater risk of injury compared with direct laryngoscopy. Furthermore, we wanted to determine if there were patient and/or surgical factors that could contribute to patient injuries following videolaryngoscopy. DATA SOURCES MAMC anesthesia records, PubMed, Ovid. REVIEW METHODS We compared rates of injury between videolaryngoscopy to direct laryngoscopy at our institution by searching anesthesia records to identify laryngoscopy procedures that resulted in injury to the soft palate or oropharynx. We also identified 19 published cases in the literature, in addition to our cases, that we reviewed for patient characteristics (e.g., body mass index, age and sex, Mallampati grade), type of videolaryngoscope, location of injury, and type of repair (if any) required. RESULTS At our institution, we have a statistically higher rate of injury using videolaryngoscopy compared to direct laryngoscopy. Our data also indicate that women are more commonly injured during videolaryngoscope intubation than men. The right tonsillar pillars and soft palate are the most frequently injured, with through-and-through perforation of the soft tissues being the most common type of injury. The most common repair of injuries required simple closures, and long-term harm was very rare. CONCLUSION Our data suggests that using video-assisted laryngoscopy for intubation puts a patient at significantly greater risk for injury compared to direct laryngoscopy.

87701,Confusion over CPR in patients with covid-19.,2020-05-06,"No study has yet investigated how the second coronavirus disease (COVID-19) lockdown has impacted the consumption of psychiatric medications in Germany. Therefore, the goal of this study was to analyze weekly pharmacy purchases of psychiatric drugs from wholesalers in this country in 2019 and 2020 using data from the IMS RPM® (Regional Pharmaceutical Market) Weekly Database. The outcome was the number of pharmacy purchases of psychiatric drugs per week from wholesalers between Calendar Week 2 and Calendar Week 52 in 2019 and 2020. Calendar Weeks 12 and 51 in 2020 corresponded to the days prior to the first and second German COVID-19 lockdowns, respectively. Descriptively, compared with 2019, the number of weekly pharmacy purchases of psychiatric drugs increased by 32% between Calendar Weeks 2-11 and Calendar Week 12 in 2020, while there was a 9% increase between Calendar Weeks 13-50 and Calendar Week 51 that same year. Overall, the relative increase in the weekly pharmacy purchases of psychiatric drugs from wholesalers was less pronounced before the second COVID-19 lockdown in Germany than before the first. Further studies are warranted to identify factors (e.g., decreases in panic buying) that may have contributed to this decreasing trend.","Jacob, Louis; Bohlken, Jens; Kostev, Karel",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.05.073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34139456/,478
88555,What's Important: Reopening Lessons from the Big Leagues' Experiences with COVID-19.,2020-11-16,"BACKGROUND COVID-19 pandemic is caused by coronavirus that is also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The viral infection continues to impact the globe with no vaccine to prevent the infection or highly effective therapeutics to treat the millions of infected people around the world. The disease starts as a respiratory infection, yet it may also be associated with a hypercoagulable state, severe inflammation owing to excessive cytokines production, and a potentially significant oxidative stress. The disease may progress to multiorgan failure and eventually death. OBJECTIVE In this article, we summarize the potential of dipyridamole as an adjunct therapy for COVID-19. METHODS We reviewed the literature describing the biological activities of dipyridamole in various settings of testing. Data were retrieved from PubMed, SciFinder-CAS, and Web of Science. The review concisely covered relevant studies starting 1977. RESULTS Dipyridamole is an approved antiplatelet drug, that has been used to prevent stroke, among other indications. Besides its antithrombotic activity, the literature indicates that dipyridamole also promotes a host of other biological activities including antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant ones. CONCLUSION Dipyridamole may substantially help improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 treatment. The pharmacokinetics profile of the drug is well established which makes it easier to design an appropriate therapeutic course. The drug is also generally safe, affordable, and available worldwide. Initial clinical trials have shown a substantial promise for dipyridamole in treating critically ill COVID-19 patients, yet larger randomized and controlled trials are needed to confirm this promise.","Aliter, Kholoud F; Al-Horani, Rami A",Current pharmaceutical design,https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612826666201001125604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33001004/,478

91050,Neurological involvement of COVID-19: from neuroinvasion and neuroimmune crosstalk to long-term consequences.,2021-02-01,"Aim: Previous research into the etiology of neuromuscular fatigue following competitive soccer match-play has primarily focused on peripheral perturbations, with limited research assessing central nervous system function in the days post-match. The aim of the present study was to examine the contribution and time-course of recovery of central and peripheral factors toward neuromuscular fatigue following competitive soccer match-play. Methods: Sixteen male semi-professional soccer players completed a 90-min soccer match. Pre-, post- and at 24, 48, and 72 h participants completed a battery of neuromuscular, physical, and perceptual tests. Maximal voluntary contraction force (MVC) and twitch responses to electrical (femoral nerve) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex during isometric knee-extension and at rest were measured to assess central nervous system (voluntary activation, VA) and muscle contractile (potentiated twitch force, Qtw, pot) function. Electromyography responses of the rectus femoris to single- and paired-pulse TMS were used to assess corticospinal excitability and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), respectively. Fatigue and perceptions of muscle soreness were assessed via visual analog scales, and physical function was assessed through measures of jump (countermovement jump height and reactive strength index) and sprint performance. Results: Competitive match-play elicited significant post-match declines in MVC force (-14%, P < 0.001) that persisted for 48 h (-4%, P = 0.01), before recovering by 72 h post-exercise. VA (motor point stimulation) was reduced immediately post-match (-8%, P < 0.001), and remained depressed at 24 h (-5%, P = 0.01) before recovering by 48 h post-exercise. Qtw,pot was reduced post-match (-14%, P < 0.001), remained depressed at 24 h (-6%, P = 0.01), before recovering by 48 h post-exercise. No changes were evident in corticospinal excitability or SICI. Jump performance took 48 h to recover, while perceptions of fatigue persisted at 72 h. Conclusion: Competitive soccer match-play elicits substantial impairments in central nervous system and muscle function, requiring up to 48 h to resolve. The results of the study could have important implications for fixture scheduling, the optimal management of the training process, squad rotation during congested competitive schedules, and the implementation of appropriate recovery interventions.","Brownstein, Callum G; Dent, Jack P; Parker, Paul; Hicks, Kirsty M; Howatson, Glyn; Goodall, Stuart; Thomas, Kevin",Frontiers in physiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2017.00831; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29118716/,478
91544,Mucosal injury following short-term tracheal intubation: A novel animal model and composite tracheal injury score.,2018,"BACKGROUND Numerous studies have suggested benefit for heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in the treatment of peritoneal metastases from colon cancer. However, the PRODIGE 7 trial that randomized 265 colon cancer patients to surgery plus HIPEC vs. surgery alone after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) did not confirm benefit. These data were published as an abstract and not as a peer-reviewed manuscript. One concern is that prior drug exposure may select for drug resistance and blunt HIPEC efficacy. METHODS A database query identified colon cancer specimens evaluated for chemotherapy sensitivity by ex-vivo analysis of programmed cell death (EVA/PCD), a primary culture platform that examines drug-induced cell death (apoptotic & non-apoptotic) by morphologic, metabolic and histologic endpoints. RESULTS Of 87 fresh colon cancer specimens, 54 (62%) were untreated and 33 (38%) had received prior folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX). In an apoptosis assay, the lethal concentration of 50% (LC50) in untreated patients was significantly lower than in patients treated by FOLFOX (p = 0.002). Then to approximate PRODIGE 7, treated patients were separated by having received oxaliplatin treatment less than or greater than 2 months before EVA/PCD analysis. The degree of resistance increasing significantly for patients who received treatment less than 2 months prior to EVA/PCD (p < 0.002). Activity for mitomycin and irinotecan was not significantly different for untreated vs. treated patients, but 5-FU was more resistant (P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS The failure of PRODIGE 7 to improve survival with surgery plus HIPEC following NACT may reflect diminished oxaliplatin cytotoxicity in patients whose residual disease has been selected for oxaliplatin and 5-FU resistance.","Nagourney, Robert A; Evans, Steven; Tran, Peter H; Nagourney, Adam J; Sugarbaker, Paul H",European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejso.2020.09.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004272/,478

92073,Resilience and Trauma among Patients with Parkinson's Disease during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-04-26,"When we first wrote Social Cognition (1984), social psychology's crisis critiqued methods, replicability, theory, and relevance. Social cognition research illustrates four phases of response to these challenges. First, the Cognitive Miser approach introduced methods less prone to experimenter or participant interference: looking time as attention, categorical memory for who said what. Next, the Motivated Tactician approach addressed replicability by identifying moderator variables, primarily goals and motivations. For example, interdependence (Fiske) and threat (Taylor) are prominent motivations in our respective research. The third wave, perceivers as Activated Actors, translated mental states to behavior, using theory-guided prediction. In intergroup bias, for example, Fiske's Stereotype Content Model predicts patterns of discriminatory behavior distinctive to each combination of stereotypic warmth and competence. Going beyond reported behavior, distinctive activations emerged in brain-imaging and muscle responses. In health psychology, Taylor's Positive Illusions theory predicts people cope with life-threatening illness by viewing the odds optimistically, the self positively, and possible control affirmatively. Again, the social cognitive processes interplay with psycho-physiology. Recently, social cognitive approaches have increasingly addressed inequality: health disparities, bias interventions, power dynamics, class effects, social morality, and intent inferences. Viewing perceivers as Inequality Enablers answers any remaining doubts about the field's continuing relevance.","Fiske, Susan T; Taylor, Shelley E",Psicothema,https://doi.org/10.7334/psicothema2020.197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32711662/,478

Given the paucity of evidence to inform otologic and neurotologic best practices during COVID-19, the recommendations herein are based on relevant peer-reviewed articles, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 guidelines, United States and international hospital policies, and expert opinion. The suggestions presented here are not meant to be definitive, and best practices will undoubtedly change with increasing knowledge and high-quality data related to COVID-19. Interpretation of this guidance document is dependent on local factors including prevalence of COVID-19 in the surgeons' local community. This is not intended to set a standard of care, and should not supersede the clinician's best judgement when managing specific clinical concerns and/or regional conditions.Access to otologic and neurotologic care during and after the COVID-19 pandemic is dependent upon adequate protection of physicians, audiologists, and ancillary support staff. Otolaryngologists and associated staff are at high risk for COVID-19 disease transmission based on close contact with mucosal surfaces of the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic procedures. While many otologic and neurotologic conditions are not imminently life threatening, they have a major impact on communication, daily functioning, and quality of life. In addition, progression of disease and delay in treatment can result in cranial nerve deficits, intracranial and life-threatening complications, and/or irreversible consequences. In this regard, many otologic and neurotologic conditions should rightfully be considered ""urgent,"" and almost all require timely attention to permit optimal outcomes. It is reasonable to proceed with otologic and neurotologic clinic visits and operative cases based on input from expert opinion of otologic care providers, clinic/hospital administration, infection prevention and control specialists, and local and state public health leaders. Significant regional variations in COVID-19 prevalence exist; therefore, physicians working with local municipalities are best suited to make determinations on the appropriateness and timing of otologic and neurotologic care.","Kozin, Elliott D; Remenschneider, Aaron K; Blevins, Nikolas H; Jan, Taha A; Quesnel, Alicia M; Chari, Divya A; Kesser, Bradley W; Weinstein, Jaqueline E; Ahsan, Syed F; Telischi, Fred F; Adunka, Oliver F; Weber, Peter; Knoll, Renata M; Coelho, Daniel H; Anne, Samantha; Franck, Kevin H; Marchioni, Daniele; Barker, Frederick G; Carter, Bob S; Lustig, Lawrence R; Bojrab, Dennis I; Bhansali, Sanjay A; Westerberg, Brian D; Lundy, Larry; Jackler, Robert K; Roland, J Thomas; Chandrasekhar, Sujana S; Antonelli, Patrick J; Carey, John P; Welling, D Bradley; Slattery, William H; Lee, Daniel J","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",https://doi.org/10.1097/mao.0000000000002868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32925832/,478

Recommendations: (1) the first line of treatment should be a csDMARD, started as soon as the diagnosis of RA is established; (2) methotrexate (MTX) is the first-choice csDMARD; (3) the combination of two or more csDMARDs, including MTX, may be used as the first line of treatment; (4) after failure of first-line therapy with MTX, the therapeutic strategies include combining MTX with another csDMARD (leflunomide), with two csDMARDs (hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine), or switching MTX for another csDMARD (leflunomide or sulfasalazine) alone; (5) after failure of two schemes with csDMARDs, a bDMARD may be preferably used or, alternatively a tsDMARD, preferably combined, in both cases, with a csDMARD; (6) the different bDMARDs in combination with MTX have similar efficacy, and therefore, the therapeutic choice should take into account the peculiarities of each drug in terms of safety and cost; (7) the combination of a bDMARD and MTX is preferred over the use of a bDMARD alone; (8) in case of failure of an initial treatment scheme with a bDMARD, a scheme with another bDMARD can be used; in cases of failure with a TNFi, a second bDMARD of the same class or with another mechanism of action is effective and safe; (9) tofacitinib can be used to treat RA after failure of bDMARD; (10) corticosteroids, preferably at low doses for the shortest possible time, should be considered during periods of disease activity, and the risk-benefit ratio should also be considered; (11) reducing or spacing out bDMARD doses is possible in patients in sustained remission.","Mota, Licia Maria Henrique da; Kakehasi, Adriana Maria; Gomides, Ana Paula Monteiro; Duarte, Angela Luzia Branco Pinto; Cruz, Bóris Afonso; Brenol, Claiton Viegas; de Albuquerque, Cleandro Pires; Castelar Pinheiro, Geraldo da Rocha; Laurindo, Ieda Maria Magalhães; Pereira, Ivanio Alves; Bertolo, Manoel Barros; Ubirajara Silva de Souza, Mariana Peixoto Guimarães; de Freitas, Max Vitor Carioca; Louzada-Júnior, Paulo; Xavier, Ricardo Machado; Giorgi, Rina Dalva Neubarth",Advances in rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42358-018-0005-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30657071/,478

Integrative medicine treatments for major depressive disorder.,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND Knowledge regarding the prevalence, clinical features and etiology of pediatric influenza-like illness (ILI) remains limited in African settings. Furthermore, it is likely that many children presenting with ILI receive antibiotics unnecessarily. More data are required to develop antimicrobial stewardship practice and guide effective vaccine strategies. We undertook a 1-year prospective study of ILI in the Gambia. METHODS Children <5 years of age presenting with ILI from March 2018 to March 2019 were recruited. Clinical and antibiotic prescribing data were collected. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and analyzed for 12 respiratory viruses using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS From a total of 735 ILI episodes, 530 (72.1%) nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for ≥1 virus. Of these, 36.7% were positive for rhinovirus, 14.7% for respiratory syncytial virus, 8.4% for influenza and 7.2% for human metapneumovirus. Compared with children <6 months of age, influenza was more common in 6- to 23-month-old children [odd ratio (OR): 5.68; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.72-18.76; P = 0.004]. Respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus were associated with low peripheral oxygen saturations (OR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.23-3.69; P = 0.007; and OR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.13-5.27; P = 0.023, respectively). Antibiotics were prescribed in 78.3% of all ILI cases. CONCLUSIONS A broad range of viruses are responsible for pediatric ILI in the Gambia. Refined treatment guidelines, improved diagnostic capacity and vaccines to prevent respiratory viruses will all play a role in reducing antimicrobial use for these cases.","Jarju, Sheikh; Greenhalgh, Khristianne; Wathuo, Miriam; Banda, Mustapha; Camara, Bakary; Mendy, Simon; Sowe, Ghata; Dahaba, Pa Omar; Jammeh, Lamin; Bajinka, Yaya; Sanneh, Papis; Jallow, Edrissa; Yates, Alexandra; Lindsey, Benjamin B; Owens, Stephen; Kampmann, Beate; Forrest, Karen; Clarke, Ed; de Silva, Thushan",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32453201/,478

However, there is a paucity of data on whether patients with IBD have an increased risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 with compared with patients without IBD. METHODS We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study in the US Veterans' Affairs healthcare system from January 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020. We matched each patient with IBD with 2 patients without IBD on age, sex, race, location, and comorbidities. The outcome of interest was development of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS Among 38,378 patients with IBD and 67,433 patients without IBD, 87 (0.23%) and 132 (0.20%) patients developed incident SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively (P = 0.29).

The zeta potential values of complexes changed from negative to positive with the increase of pea protein as a result of positively charged complexes formation. The increase in the ratio of pea protein/hydrolysates also resulted in increased turbidity in all samples. Particle size measurements indicated that the complexes tended to form larger aggregates (ranged from 61.5 ± 1.7 μm to 183 ± 2.8 μm). The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of the pea protein/fish protein hydrolysate complexes was higher than that of the protein hydrolysates alone. Moreover, increasing levels of pea protein did not affect the antioxidant activity of fish protein hydrolysates. The complexes of the Paralonchurus brasiliensis were chosen for the microencapsulation process by spray-drying. The results revealed that spray-drying did not have a significant effect (P > 0.05) on the protein hydrolysate antioxidant activity when they were complexed with pea protein. Thus, this work suggests that the complexation with pea protein and subsequent microencapsulation by spray-drying is an efficient way to protect the biological activity of protein hydrolysates obtained from bycatch. This study provides evidence for the potential use of bycatch from shrimp fisheries as functional ingredients or nutraceuticals.","Camargo, Tavani Rocha; Khelissa, Simon; Chihib, Nour Eddine; Dumas, Emilie; Wang, Jian; Valenti, Wagner C; Gharsallaoui, Adem",Marine biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10126-021-10026-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763809/,478

The related scaffold proteins, TKS5 and TKS4, are key components of the mechanism of invadopodia assembly. The molecular events through which TKS proteins direct collagenolytic invadopodia formation are poorly defined. Using coimmunoprecipitation experiments, identification of bound proteins by mass spectrometry, and in vitro pull-down experiments, we found an interaction between TKS5 and FGD1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rho-GTPase CDC42, which is known for its role in the assembly of invadopodial actin core structure. A novel cell polarity network is uncovered comprising TKS5, FGD1, and CDC42, directing invadopodia formation and the polarization of MT1-MMP recycling compartments, required for invadopodia activity and invasion in a 3D collagen matrix. Additionally, our data unveil distinct signaling pathways involved in collagenolytic invadopodia formation downstream of TKS4 or TKS5 in breast cancer cells.","Zagryazhskaya-Masson, Anna; Monteiro, Pedro; Macé, Anne-Sophie; Castagnino, Alessia; Ferrari, Robin; Infante, Elvira; Duperray-Susini, Aléria; Dingli, Florent; Lanyi, Arpad; Loew, Damarys; Génot, Elisabeth; Chavrier, Philippe",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201910132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32673397/,478

The high prevalence and spread ways of COVID-19 have become an international challenge that requires careful consideration. We aimed to review the current evidence of COVID-19 transmission modes. METHODS This study was a systematic review that was done to identify current evidence on transmission modes of COVID19. We searched selected keywords in six important databases to discover related sources on the main objective of the study. To identify studies meeting the inclusion criteria, the authors screened the titles and abstracts of retrieved documents. The appropriate articles were selected and their results were discussed to make the final inclusion. RESULTS We identified five potential transmission modes of COVID-19 including airborne, droplet, contact with contaminated surfaces, oral and fecal secretions. Furthermore, some studies have pointed out other modes of virus transmission, such as person to person, and direct contact with animals. CONCLUSION Droplet and contact with contaminated surfaces were the most frequent transmission modes of COVID-19. Fecal excretion, environmental contamination, and fluid pollution might contribute to a viral transmission. The possibility of fecal transmission of COVID-19 has implications, especially in areas with poor sanitation and the environmental pollution can be caused by patients with SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory droplets and feces, subsequently, the human environment will change to a potential medium of virus transmission.","Mehraeen, Esmaeil; Salehi, Mohammad Amin; Behnezhad, Farzane; Moghaddam, Hamed Rezakhani; SeyedAlinaghi, SeyedAhmad",Infectious disorders drug targets,https://doi.org/10.2174/1871526520666201116095934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33200716/,478

It is essential to prepare our healthcare workers on complex and unique issues in the treatment of older adults. Past studies have shown that simulated patients are a valuable teaching tool in training current and prospective healthcare professionals. Few studies have examined its use in the geriatric context. OBJECTIVES This scoping review presents the effectiveness of simulated patients in healthcare education for geriatric care and eldercare purposes among current and prospective healthcare professionals. DATA SOURCES Search on CINAHL, Cochrane, ScienceDirect and Medline were completed on studies published between January 2009 to January 2020. A manual hand searching of reference lists for relevant articles was also conducted. REVIEW METHODS This scoping review follows the methods of Arksey and O-Malley to synthesize the literature on simulated patients in the teaching of geriatric care to current and prospective healthcare professionals. Inclusion criteria were, primary studies, with full-text articles, and in English. RESULTS Fifteen articles were included in this review. These articles were of wide variation by study design, settings, populations. Four broad themes were identified from existing literature: (i) improvement in geriatric knowledge, (ii) improvement in technical and non-technical skills, (iii) greater confidence in clinical and non-clinical skills, and (iv) learners' perception towards simulation as a learning pedagogy. CONCLUSION Simulated patients may have potential in improving geriatric education. Students generally enjoyed the learning methodology, finding it engaging and easy to learn by practising. Future studies could consider engaging simulated patients in the teaching pedagogy of geriatric teaching for current or prospective healthcare professionals.","Siew, An Ling; Wong, Jing Wen; Chan, Ee-Yuee",Nurse education today,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2021.104856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740706/,478

99466,[Smell and taste in CoViD-19 patients: the forgotten sense.],2020-10-01,"INTRODUCTION Telepsychiatry can improve access to psychiatric services for those who otherwise cannot easily access care. Family physicians are gatekeepers to specialized care in Ontario, so it is essential to understand predictors relating to referrals to telepsychiatry to better plan services and increase telepsychiatry adoption. METHODS This study used an annual retrospective cross-sectional study design to compare physicians who referred their patients to telepsychiatry each year from fiscal year (FY) 2008 to FY 2016. A 1-year (FY 2016) comparison of family physicians who referred to telepsychiatry (FPTs) compared to family physicians who did not refer to telepsychiatry (FPNTs) matched (1:2) by region was also conducted. Finally, we used statistical modeling to understand the predictors of referring to telepsychiatry among physicians. RESULTS Between FY 2008 and FY 2016, the number of patients receiving telepsychiatry increased from 925 visits to 13,825 visits. Thirty-two percent of Ontario primary care physicians referred to telepsychiatry in 2016. Several characteristics were notably different between FPTs and FPNTs: FPTs were more likely to be from a residence with less than 10,000 people, to have more nurse practitioners in the practice, and to be from a family health team than FPNTs. Rostered patients of FPTs were more likely to reside in rural areas, have more clinical complexity, and to utilize more mental health services compared to FPNTs. CONCLUSIONS There has been an increase in the use of telepsychiatry by patients and family physicians over the study period, although there remains opportunity for significant growth. Family physicians who live in rural areas, are part of an FHT, have more NPs, with more rural and complex patients were more likely to refer to telepsychiatry. As recent pro-telemedicine policies support the growth of telepsychiatry, this study will serve as an important baseline.","Serhal, Eva; Iwajomo, Tomisin; de Oliveira, Claire; Crawford, Allison; Kurdyak, Paul",Canadian journal of psychiatry.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish a simple nomogram model to identify the determinants of hypertension in patients with T2DM and to quickly calculate the probability of hypertension in individuals with T2DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 643,439 subjects participating in the national physical examination has been recruited in this cross-sectional study. After excluding unqualified subjects, 30,507 adults with T2DM were included in the final analysis. 21,355 and 9,152 subjects were randomly assigned to the model developing group and validation group, respectively, with a ratio of 7:3. The potential risk factors used in this study to assess hypertension in patients with T2DM included questionnaire investigation and physical measurement variables. We used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator models to optimize feature selection, and the multivariable logistic regression analysis was for predicting model. Discrimination and calibration were assessed using the receiver operating curve (ROC) and calibration curve. RESULTS The results showed that the major determinants of hypertension in patients with T2DM were age, gender, drinking, exercise, smoking, obesity and atherosclerotic vascular disease. The area under ROC curve of developing group and validation group are both 0.814, indicating that the prediction model owns high disease recognition ability. The p values of the two calibration curves are 0.625 and 0.445, suggesting that the nomogram gives good calibration. CONCLUSION The individualized nomogram model can facilitate improved screening and early identification of patients with hypertension in T2DM.

Several instruments are available in the world to evaluate PHC services, including the family of instruments of the Primary Care Assessment Tool (PCAT), developed and disseminated by Starfield & Shi to assess the existence and extent of the features of primary health care services. Reinforcing the importance of using this instrument in Brazil, the Ministry of Health published in 2020 a new edition of the Brazilian version that informs the methodology used for such instruments, reviving the role of IBGE as a significant external evaluator of the SUS. The IBGE pioneered in its primary household random sample survey, the National Health Survey, a question-based module of the reduced version of the PCAT for adult users. The leading global results found for Brazil (overall PCAT score=5.9) inform that those who use PHC services (adults with referred morbidities) the most are also those who evaluate these services most positively. Differences were also observed among the residents of households registered by the family health teams, those receiving visits from the community and endemic workers, and age groups (older people evaluate services more positively).","Pinto, Luiz Felipe; Silva, Vinicius Siqueira Tavares Meira",Ciencia & saude coletiva,https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232021262.42552020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33605341/,478

Such heterogeneity is thought to be dynamic, shifting over periods of minutes to hours in response to signaling inputs from the tumor microenvironment. However, models of this process have been inferred from indirect or post-hoc measurements of cell state, leaving the temporal details of signaling-driven heterogeneity undefined. Here, we developed a live-cell model system in which microenvironment-driven signaling dynamics can be directly observed and linked to variation in gene expression. Our analysis reveals that paracrine signaling between two cell types is sufficient to drive continual diversification of gene expression programs. This diversification emerges from systems-level properties of the EGFR-RAS-ERK signaling cascade, including intracellular amplification of amphiregulin-mediated paracrine signals and differential kinetic filtering by target genes including Fra-1, c-Myc, and Egr1. Our data enable more precise modeling of paracrine-driven transcriptional variation as a generator of gene expression heterogeneity.

This has inspired the formation of specialised intensive care units or services to provide dedicated care of brain-injured patients, as well as new training pathways for physicians. However, expansion has been variable worldwide and it is yet to be determined if there are clear benefits in regard to patient outcomes. We are planning a systematic review with meta-analysis to assess whether the introduction of neurocritical care units or services, or neurointensivists have favourable effects on survival. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will include all observational and interventional studies comparing specialised neurocritical care units or services with general or non-specialised units in the care of acutely brain-injured adults. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality at the longest follow-up, and secondary outcomes will be intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, and functional outcomes. All relevant studies will be identified through database searches. All study selection and data extraction will be conducted by two independent reviewers. We will conduct a random-effects meta-analysis to synthesise evidence for all outcomes. In addition, we will perform a subgroup analysis by disease process. We will assess confidence in the cumulative evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework.

103726,Searching for the perfect timing: Should we routinely extubate patients in the operating room?,2020-09-03,"Healthcare workers (HCW) are a risk group for TB. Even in countries with low TB incidence, the risk of TB in HCW is elevated for a wide range of tasks in healthcare, and the prevention of nosocomial infection of HCW remains as a challenge. IFN-γ release assays (IGRA) facilitate the screening of HCW for latent TB infection. In comparison with the tuberculin skin test, the IGRA reduces the number of x-rays and the amount of chemoprevention needed. However, a borderline zone should be introduced for the interpretation of IGRA results in the serial testing of HCW. More data on disease progression depending on conversion and reversion in IGRA is needed and a better test, which is able to distinguish recent from remote latent TB infection, would be desirable in the future.","Nienhaus, Albert; Ringshausen, Felix C; Costa, José Torres; Schablon, Anja; Tripodi, Dominique",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1586/eri.12.150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23428101/,478
103984,Organizing pneumonia-like pattern in COVID-19.,2021-10-06,"Power-law behaviors are common in many disciplines, especially in network science. Real-world networks, like disease spreading among people, are more likely to be interconnected communities, and show richer power-law behaviors than isolated networks. In this paper, we look at the system of two communities which are connected by bridge links between a fraction r of bridge nodes, and study the effect of bridge nodes to the final state of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model by mapping it to link percolation. By keeping a fixed average connectivity, but allowing different transmissibilities along internal and bridge links, we theoretically derive different power-law asymptotic behaviors of the total fraction of the recovered R in the final state as r goes to zero, for different combinations of internal and bridge link transmissibilities. We also find crossover points where R follows different power-law behaviors with r on both sides when the internal transmissibility is below but close to its critical value for different bridge link transmissibilities. All of these power-law behaviors can be explained through different mechanisms of how finite clusters in each community are connected into the giant component of the whole system, and enable us to pick effective epidemic strategies and to better predict their impacts.","Ma, Jing; Valdez, Lucas D; Braunstein, Lidia A",Physical review.

104235,Role of telepharmacy in pharmacist counselling to coronavirus disease 2019 patients and medication dispensing errors.,2020-10-15,"In recent decades, endovascular aneurysm repair or endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) has become an acceptable alternative to open surgery for the treatment of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms and other aortic pathologies such as the acute aortic syndromes (e.g., penetrating aortic ulcer, intramural hematoma, dissection). Available data suggest that endovascular repair is associated with lower perioperative 30-day all-cause mortality as well as a significant reduction in perioperative morbidity when compared to open surgery. Additionally, EVAR leads to decreased blood loss, eliminates the need for cross-clamping the aorta and has shorter recovery periods than traditional surgery. It is currently the preferred mode of treatment of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms in a subset of patients who meet certain anatomic criteria conducive to endovascular repair. The main disadvantage of EVAR procedures is the high rate of post-procedural complications that often require secondary re-intervention. As a result, most authorities recommend lifelong imaging surveillance following repair. Available surveillance modalities include conventional radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance angiography, ultrasonography, nuclear imaging and conventional angiography, with computed tomography currently considered to be the gold standard for surveillance by most experts. Following endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, the rate of complications is estimated to range between 16% and 30%. The complication rate is higher following thoracic EVAR (TEVAR) and is estimated to be as high as 38%. Common complications include both those related to the endograft device and systemic complications. Device-related complications include endoleaks, endograft migration or collapse, kinking and/or stenosis of an endograft limb and graft infection. Post-procedural systemic complications include end-organ ischemia, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events and post-implantation syndrome. Secondary re-interventions are required in approximately 19% to 24% of cases following endovascular abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysm repair respectively. Typically, most secondary reinterventions involve the use of percutaneous techniques such as placement of cuff extension devices, additional endograft components or stents, enhancement of endograft fixation, treatment of certain endoleaks using various embolization techniques and embolic agents and thrombolysis of occluded endograft components. Less commonly, surgical conversion and/or open surgical modification are required. In this article, we provide an overview of the most common complications that may occur following endovascular repair of thoracic and AAAs. We also summarize the current surveillance recommendations for detecting and evaluating these complications and discuss various current secondary re-intervention approaches that may typically be employed for treatment.","Daye, Dania; Walker, T Gregory",Cardiovascular diagnosis and therapy,https://doi.org/10.21037/cdt.2017.09.17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29850426/,478

Methods Intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation was induced in Fbn1Tsk/+ and wild type (wt) mice by injecting microbeads into the anterior chamber. Mice were then followed up for four months, with IOP measurements every three to six days. Retinas were stained for Brn3a to determine RGC number. Optic nerve cross-sections were stained with p-phenylene diamine to determine nerve area, axon number, and caliber and thickness of the pia mater. Results Microbead injection induced significant IOP elevation that was significantly less for Fbn1Tsk/+ mice compared with wt. The optic nerves and optic nerve axons were larger, and the elastic fiber-rich pia mater was thinner in Fbn1Tsk/+ mice. Microbead injection resulted in reduced optic nerve size, thicker pia mater, and a slight decrease in axon size. Fbn1Tsk/+ mice had significantly greater loss of RGCs and optic nerve axons compared with wt (14.8% vs. 5.8%, P = 0.002, and 17.0% vs. 7.5%, P = 0.002, respectively). Conclusions Fbn1Tsk/+mice had altered optic nerve structure as indicated by larger optic nerves, larger optic nerve axons and thinner pia mater, consistent with our previous findings. Despite lower IOP elevation, Fbn1Tsk/+mice had greater loss of RGCs and optic nerve axons, suggesting increased susceptibility to IOP-induced optic nerve degeneration in microfibril-deficient mice.","Wu, Hang-Jing; Kuchtey, John; Kuchtey, Rachel W",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.61.10.28; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797197/,478

Though the coronavirus infection affects all age and sex groups, the mortality is skewed towards the elderly population and the cause of death is mostly acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There are data suggesting the role of excessive immune activation and cytokine storm as the cause of lung injury in COVID-19. The excessive immune activation and cytokine storm usually occurs due to an imbalance in redox homeostasis of the individuals. Considering the antioxidant and free radical scavenging action of N acetyl cysteine (NAC), its use might be useful in COVID-19 patients by decreasing the cytokine storm consequently decreasing the disease severity. Therefore, we reviewed all the available resources pertaining to the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cytokine storm and the mechanism of action of NAC in preventing ROS. We also reviewed the use of NAC in COVID-19.","Mohanty, R R; Padhy, B M; Das, S; Meher, B R",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202103_25442; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33829465/,478

The primary aim of this retrospective study is to analyze weight loss outcome after revision of failed LGCP into laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Patients and Methods: Patients who experienced failure (insufficient weight loss/weight regain) after LGCP performed in our center from 2009 to 2012 were included. LSG was performed for all patients. Results: Among 127 who underwent LGCP, 42 patients (33%) underwent revision. Mean body mass index (BMI) at time of LGCP was 44 ± 6 kg/m2. The highest % total weight loss (%TWL) after LGCP ranged from 11% to 34% (24.1 ± 5) (corresponding to % excess weight loss [%EWL] of 12%-47% [33.5 ± 12]). The time interval between LGCP and LSG ranged from 12 to 25 months (15.4 ± 3.8). After conversion, 2 patients (5%) experienced acute leakage managed by endoscopic stenting. After LSG, mean BMI (kg/m2) was 38, 32, 30, 28, 29, 30.2, and 30.4, while mean %TWL reached 9%, 19%, 24%, 29%, 25%, 25%, and 24% and mean %EWL reached 15%, 51%, 69%, 77%, 68%, 66%, and 64% at 1 month, 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively. Except for results at 1 month, all results showed statistical significance (P ≤ .05).

Prior research has shown some topical makeup products absorb alternate light similar to the absorption noted in bruises. Therefore, the purposes of this study were (a) to further examine the ALS findings of multiple brands and types of makeup products and (b) to compare the efficacy of three methods of makeup removal. METHODS Fourteen makeup products were applied to the forearms of 100 healthy adult volunteers with varying skin tones and then assessed under white light, six alternate light wavelengths, and three color filters, producing 19 total wavelength-and-filter combinations. The results were recorded before and after removal procedures by forensic nurse examiners who were blinded to the removal method. A three-arm randomized controlled trial of makeup removal methods (soap and water, isopropyl alcohol swab, makeup removal wipe) was conducted with the participants. RESULTS All 14 makeup products produced absorption in at least 10% of the observations. Fluorescence was observed in more than 10% of the observations for only two products. After product removal, four products continued to produce statistically significant absorption findings when viewed under an ALS. One product produced significant fluorescence after removal procedures. There were no statistically significant differences between the removal methods noted in any of these analyses. CONCLUSION Our findings support the importance of using alternate light as one component of a comprehensive forensic examination, including history taking and physical examination.","Anderson, Jocelyn C; Pollitt, Erin N; Schildbach, Caroline; MacDonald, Ryan; Rose, Lauren; Sheridan, Daniel J",Journal of forensic nursing,https://doi.org/10.1097/jfn.0000000000000300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33060415/,478

The aim of this study was to report the safety and feasibility of the robotic-assisted repair. METHODS The study was approved by the local ethic committee (2019-01132 CE3495). A retrospective search on a prospectively collected dataset including demographic and clinical records on robotic surgery at our institution was performed to identify patients treated for a flank hernia. Patients were followed-up 6 months. RESULTS From January 2018 to December 2019, out of 190 patients who underwent robotic-assisted hernia surgery, seven with incisional flank hernia were included. Median age was 69.0 years (IQR 63.2-78.0), BMI was 27.3 kg/m2 (IQR 25.8-32.3) and two patients were male (29%). All patients were referred to surgery because of pain, whereas one of them described recurrent episodes of small bowel obstruction. The median hernia defect measured 25 mm ((IQR 21-40), median mesh diameter was 10 cm (IQR 10-12.5) and median operative time was 137 min (IQR 133-174). No intraoperative complication occurred. Postoperatively, one patient developed a pneumonia, which required antibiotics. Length of hospital stay was 4.0 days (IQR 3.0-7.7). Six months after surgery, neither recurrence nor chronic pain were recorded. CONCLUSIONS Robotics in abdominal wall hernia surgery remains a matter of debate, despite a growing interest from the surgical community. In our reported experience with flank hernias, we found the robotic-assisted approach to be safe and feasible for the treatment of this uncommon clinical entity.","Di Giuseppe, Matteo; Mongelli, Francesco; Marcantonio, Maria; La Regina, Davide; Pini, Ramon",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-020-00843-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32787817/,478

METHODS During the Fourth International Consensus Summit on LSG in New York Dec. 2012, an online questionnaire (SurveyMonkey®) was filled out by 130 surgeons experienced in LSG. The survey was submitted directly to the statisticians. RESULTS The 130 surgeons performed 354.9 ± SD 453 LSGs/surgeon (median 175), for a total of 46,133 LSGs. The LSGs had been performed over 4.9 ± 2.7 year (range 1-10). Of the 46,133 LSGs, 0.2 ± 1.0 % (median 0, range 0-10 %) were converted to an open operation. LSG was intended as the sole operation in 93.1 ± 14.8 %; in 3.0 ± 6.3 %, a second stage became necessary. Of the 130 surgeons, 40 (32 %) use a 36F bougie, which was most common (range 32-50F). Staple-line is reinforced by 79 %; of these, 57 % use a buttress and 43 % over-sew. Mean %EWL at year 1 was 59.3 %; year 2, 59.0 %; year 3, 54.7 %; year 4, 52.3 %; year 5, 52.4 %; and year 6, 50.6 %.

The Italian Serie A league abruptly interrupted all competitions and teams could not train in a group anymore. These containment measures were gradually eased in May. The aim of this study was to ascertain the impact of the lockdown-restart transition on the body composition of a group of Italian footballers of a Serie A team during the pandemic. METHODS The body composition of 18 male football players (age27.6 ± 4.5 yr.) from an Italian Serie A team was studied by bioelectrical impedance (BIA). Measures were conducted after lockdown, when they restarted to train in group with the ball (T0), and after the first regular match (T1). RESULTS Results show that there were no changes in body mass, body mass index, fat mass, fat-free mass, and total body water between T0 and T1. Differently, intracellular water, extracellular water, and phase angle were changed. CONCLUSIONS We concluded that the lockdown did not have any impact in athletes' body composition as they kept training at home. Moreover, the BIA method was able to detect subtle signals of shift in body water compartments (intra cellular and extra cellular water) likely due to the different kind of training conducted during and after the lockdown.","Ghiani, Giovanna; Roberto, Silvana; Mura, Roberto; Fois, Francesco; Scorcu, Marco; Crisafulli, Antonio",The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0022-4707.21.12894-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34651614/,478
113168,Post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis.,2021-05-01,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a rapidly worsening global epidemic over the last thirty-five years. The increased prevalence of DM has changed the phenotypic expression of atherosclerotic limb threatening ischemia (LTI), resulting in an increase in lesions in the tibial vessels. These patients are also afflicted with peripheral neuropathy, foot deformities, and medial calcification of the vasculature. In response to the evolving phenotype of atherosclerosis, newer minimally invasive tools and techniques have been developed to improve the blood supply in LTI. Arterial access, traditionally obtained from the contralateral common femoral artery (CFA) in a retrograde fashion, is now also frequently being obtained in the ipsilateral limb in an antegrade fashion. Retrograde access of the tibial, pedal, tarsal, or calf collateral vessels is also being utilized to provide a route through which wires, catheters, balloons and stents may be placed. Wires have evolved to have a variety of diameters, materials and coatings providing interventionalists with a wide variety of choices when attempting to traverse blockages in the arteries. When catheters and wires fail to traverse the lesion, newer chronic total occlusion (CTO) devices have been developed to aid in the placement of a wire across the offending lesions. Due to medial calcification associated with DM, atherectomy devices have been developed to debulk the atherosclerotic plaque within the vessel. High pressure balloon angioplasty with or without stents remain the mainstay of intervention, with drug-coated balloons (DCBs) and drug-eluting stents (DESs) now being frequently used to prevent reocclusions of atherosclerotic lesions.","Chung, Jayer",Journal of diabetes science and technology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1932296817702169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28349710/,478
113476,Urticaria and COVID-19 infection: a critical appraisal- Reply.,2020-09-02,"Casual videogames (CVGs), played on smartphones, are becoming increasingly popular, especially among females and adults. Whereas the addictive potential of online (computer) videogames is well-established, there is yet insufficient evidence for Internet gaming disorder (IGD) in mobile gamers and for the mediating role of some mechanisms involved. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the frustration of psychological needs on mobile videogamers' addictive behavior as well as the role of cognitions (game-use expectancies) and behaviors (time spent playing) through a hypothesized serial mediation model, while controlling for important correlates, such as game genre, age, gender and payment during play. A total of 471 mobile game users (211 males) with an average age of 21.73 replied to an online survey containing sociodemographic and game variables, the Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale (NSFS), the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form (IGDS9-SF) and a slightly modified version of the Internet Use Expectancies Scale (IUES). The results corroborate the negative effects of need frustration on IGD among mobile gamers and clarify the role of time spent playing and game-use expectancies in the development of IGD, highlighting the important role of cognitions in this relationship. We conclude that both the time spent playing and game-use expectancies should be important targets for clinical interventions, even though they are not included in the diagnostic criteria.","Chamarro, Andrés; Oberst, Ursula; Cladellas, Ramón; Fuster, Héctor",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899364/,478

Herein we extend this concept to the field of noble metal nanocrystals and report the solution synthesis of metastable face-centered tetragonal Au that has not been discovered before. The successful synthesis relies on the formation of intermetallic AuCu3@Au core-shell structure, where the interface strain stabilizes the metastable fct Au overlayer. Compared with the face-centered cubic Au counterpart, the metastable fct Au shows greatly improved catalytic activity toward CO2 reduction to CO.

Patients and parents completed preintervention and postintervention surveys to assess likeability and concussion knowledge including concussion definition, symptoms, return-to-ED criteria, and resuming normal activity. Data were analyzed using descriptive and comparative statistics. RESULTS A total of 57 patients (47.4% female; mean age, 15 years) and 37 guardians were enrolled. Most (73%) concussions were sports related, with the majority having sought care within 24 hours in an ED (80%). Over half (51%) had experienced 2 or more prior concussions. Overall, 31 adolescents and 20 guardians viewed both comic and video, whereas 26 adolescents and 17 guardians viewed the comic only. Both comic and video were favorably reviewed, but a higher proportion of respondents rated the video more positively than the comic for likability (P < 0.01), comprehensibility (P < 0.05), and increasing understanding (P < 0.05). Patients' knowledge of some concussion symptoms emphasized in the comic increased after reading (emotional changes, P = 0.02; vomiting, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS Patients showed increased concussion knowledge using the favorably endorsed comic-based discharge instructions. Using comic-based supplemental discharge tools may optimize concussion education for adolescents.","Kolberg, Kristen; Larson, Jennifer; Almeida, Andrea; Ichesco, Ingrid; Johnson, Abigail; Van Tubbergen, Marie; Nagappan, Bella S; Saleem, Noor; Cranford, James A; Hashikawa, Andrew",Pediatric emergency care,https://doi.org/10.1097/pec.0000000000002133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530836/,478
114606,Covid-19: Known risk factors fail to explain the increased risk of death among people from ethnic minorities.,2020-05-11,"ABSTRACT This study investigated the association between COVID-related myalgia experienced by patients at hospital admission and the presence of post-COVID symptoms. A case-control study including patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 between February 20 and May 31, 2020 was conducted. Patients reporting myalgia and patients without myalgia at hospital admission were scheduled for a telephone interview 7 months after hospital discharge. Hospitalisation and clinical data were collected from medical records. A list of post-COVID symptoms with attention to musculoskeletal pain was evaluated. Anxiety and depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were likewise assessed. From a total 1,200 hospitalised COVID-19 patients, 369 with and 369 without myalgia at hospital admission were assessed 7.2 months (SD 0.6) after hospital discharge. A greater proportion (P=0.03) of patients with myalgia at hospital admission (20%) showed ≥3 post-COVID symptoms when compared with individuals without myalgia (13%). A higher proportion of patients presenting myalgia (OR1.41, 95%CI 1.04-1.90) exhibited musculoskeletal post-COVID pain when compared to those without myalgia. The prevalence of musculoskeletal post-COVID pain in the total sample was 38%. Fifty percent of individuals with pre-existing musculoskeletal pain experienced a worsening of their symptoms after COVID-19. No differences in fatigue, dyspnoea, anxiety/depressive levels or sleep quality were observed between myalgia and non-myalgia groups. The presence of myalgia at hospital admission was associated with pre-existing history of musculoskeletal pain (OR1.62, 95%CI 1.10-2.40). In conclusion, myalgia at the acute phase was associated with musculoskeletal pain as long-term post-COVID sequelae. Additionally, half of patients with pre-existing pain conditions experienced a persistent exacerbation of their previous syndromes.","Fernández-de-Las-Peñas, César; Rodríguez-Jiménez, Jorge; Fuensalida-Novo, Stella; Palacios-Ceña, María; Gómez-Mayordomo, Víctor; Florencio, Lidiane L; Hernández-Barrera, Valentín; Arendt-Nielsen, Lars",Pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33863864/,478

115189,COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease: characteristic features in older patients.,2020-10-16,"Current studies have revealed the immune effects of graphene oxide (GO) and have utilized them as vaccine carriers and adjuvants. However, GO easily induces strong oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction at the site of injection. It is very necessary to develop an alternative adjuvant based on graphene oxide derivatives for improving immune responses and decreasing side effects. Carnosine (Car) is an outstanding and safe antioxidant. Herein, the feasibility and efficiency of ultrasmall graphene oxide decorated with carnosine as an alternative immune adjuvant were explored. OVA@GO-Car was prepared by simply mixing ovalbumin (OVA, a model antigen) with ultrasmall GO covalently modified with carnosine (GO-Car). We investigated the immunological properties of the GO-Car adjuvant in model mice. Results show that OVA@GO-Car can promote robust and durable OVA-specific antibody response, increase lymphocyte proliferation efficiency, and enhance CD4(+) T and CD8(+) T cell activation. The presence of Car in GO also probably contributes to enhancing the antigen-specific adaptive immune response through modulating the expression of some cytokines, including IL-6, CXCL1, CCL2, and CSF3. In addition, the safety of GO-Car as an adjuvant was evaluated comprehensively. No symptoms such as allergic response, inflammatory redness swelling, raised surface temperatures, physiological anomalies of blood, and remarkable weight changes were observed. Besides, after modification with carnosine, histological damages caused by GO-Car in lung, muscle, kidney, and spleen became weaken significantly. This study sufficiently suggest that GO-Car as a safe adjuvant can effectively enhance humoral and innate immune responses against antigens in vivo.","Meng, Chunchun; Zhi, Xiao; Li, Chao; Li, Chuanfeng; Chen, Zongyan; Qiu, Xusheng; Ding, Chan; Ma, Lijun; Lu, Hongmin; Chen, Di; Liu, Guangqing; Cui, Daxiang",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5b06750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26766427/,478
115230,The impact of false positive COVID-19 results in an area of low prevalence.,2020-11-26,"UNLABELLED Ubiquitin-like domains (Ubls) now are recognized as common elements adjacent to viral and cellular proteases; however, their function is unclear. Structural studies of the papain-like protease (PLP) domains of coronaviruses (CoVs) revealed an adjacent Ubl domain in severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV, and the murine CoV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Here, we tested the effect of altering the Ubl adjacent to PLP2 of MHV on enzyme activity, viral replication, and pathogenesis. Using deletion and substitution approaches, we identified sites within the Ubl domain, residues 785 to 787 of nonstructural protein 3, which negatively affect protease activity, and valine residues 785 and 787, which negatively affect deubiquitinating activity. Using reverse genetics, we engineered Ubl mutant viruses and found that AM2 (V787S) and AM3 (V785S) viruses replicate efficiently at 37°C but generate smaller plaques than wild-type (WT) virus, and AM2 is defective for replication at higher temperatures. To evaluate the effect of the mutation on protease activity, we purified WT and Ubl mutant PLP2 and found that the proteases exhibit similar specific activities at 25°C. However, the thermal stability of the Ubl mutant PLP2 was significantly reduced at 30°C, thereby reducing the total enzymatic activity. To determine if the destabilizing mutation affects viral pathogenesis, we infected C57BL/6 mice with WT or AM2 virus and found that the mutant virus is highly attenuated, yet it replicates sufficiently to elicit protective immunity. These studies revealed that modulating the Ubl domain adjacent to the PLP reduces protease stability and viral pathogenesis, revealing a novel approach to coronavirus attenuation. IMPORTANCE Introducing mutations into a protein or virus can have either direct or indirect effects on function. We asked if changes in the Ubl domain, a conserved domain adjacent to the coronavirus papain-like protease, altered the viral protease activity or affected viral replication or pathogenesis. Our studies using purified wild-type and Ubl mutant proteases revealed that mutations in the viral Ubl domain destabilize and inactivate the adjacent viral protease. Furthermore, we show that a CoV encoding the mutant Ubl domain is unable to replicate at high temperature or cause lethal disease in mice. Our results identify the coronavirus Ubl domain as a novel modulator of viral protease stability and reveal manipulating the Ubl domain as a new approach for attenuating coronavirus replication and pathogenesis.","Mielech, Anna M; Deng, Xufang; Chen, Yafang; Kindler, Eveline; Wheeler, Dorthea L; Mesecar, Andrew D; Thiel, Volker; Perlman, Stanley; Baker, Susan C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00338-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25694594/,478

Inherent design flaws in the standard high-volume low-pressure cuffed tracheal tubes form a major part of the pathogenic mechanism causing VAP. The formation of folds in the inflated cuff leads to microaspiration of pooled oropharyngeal secretions into the trachea, and biofilm formation on the inner surface of the tracheal tube helps to maintain bacterial colonization of the lower airways. Improved design of tracheal tubes with new cuff material and shape have reduced the size and number of these folds, which together with the addition of suction ports above the cuff to drain pooled subglottic secretions leads to reduced aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions. Furthermore, coating tracheal tubes with antibacterial agents reduces biofilm formation and the incidence of VAP. In this Viewpoint article we explore the published data supporting the new tracheal tubes and their potential contribution to VAP prevention strategies. We also propose that it may now be against good medical practice to continue to use a 'standard cuffed tube' given what is already known, and the weight of evidence supporting the use of newer tube designs.","Zolfaghari, Parjam S; Wyncoll, Duncan L A",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/cc10352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21996487/,478
116762,Cobalt and chromium levels in blood and urine following hip resurfacing arthroplasty with the Conserve Plus implant.,2011,"Urbanization is progressing rapidly. It can affect soils ecosystem services directly through land management and indirectly through changes in the socioeconomic environment, which eventually leads to an increase in emissions of greenhouse gases. Soil carbon (C) sequestration plays an important role in offsetting the anthropogenic C emissions. However, there is limited knowledge of how urbanization affects the soil C especially that in suburban. In this study, we studied changes in easily oxidizable organic C (EOC) and total organic C (TOC) of suburban soils (0-100 cm) in the rapid urbanising megacity Chengdu, China. The EOC stock and TOC stock decreased from the outer-suburb to the inner-suburb by 17.8-28.2% and 5.4-13.5%, respectively; particularly, the inner-suburb EOC decreased by 31.4-38.6% during the past 10 years. The quotient of EOC/TOC in the soil profile, reflecting the stability of soil C, declined from the outer-suburb (0.78) to the inner-suburb (0.20). Factors that influenced the EOC and TOC included the changes in economics (economic density, industrialization), farmland (cultivated area, farmland structure), urbanization (city size, population growth) and traffic flow. Among which, economic density growth was the primarily driver of the loss in TOC, explaining 31.6% of the variation in soil surface TOC and 16.0% of the variation in subsoil TOC; changes in farmland and urban expansion were the main factors contributing to the loss of subsoil EOC, with 40.4% explanatory ability. In addition, traffic flow also has contribution to the subsoil EOC loss. We concluded that the increasing soil C loss with decreasing distance from the city centre has a continuous contribution to C emission, and the C loss will persist until the suburbs are fully urbanized. The large losses of EOC and TOC caused by urbanization, and their contribution to global warming, necessitate their consideration in future appraisals of climate change and urban planning projects.","Luo, Youlin; Shen, Jie; Chen, Aifang; Tao, Qi; Li, Qiquan; White, Philip J; Li, Tingqiang; Li, Bing; Chen, Lin; Li, Huanxiu; Gao, Xuesong; Xu, Qiang; Wang, Changquan",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932679/,478

METHOD A review of the literature on disability and COVID-19 is provided, with an emphasis on sources of trauma and stress that disproportionately impact the disability community and the ways in which disability intersects with other marginalized identities in the context of trauma and the pandemic. We also reflect on the potential impacts on the field of psychology and the ways in which psychologists, led by rehabilitation psychologists, can support disabled clients and the broader disability community at both the individual client and systemic levels. RESULTS The COVID-19 pandemic introduces unique potential sources of trauma and stress within the disability community, including concerns about health care rationing and ableism in health care, isolation, and the deaths and illnesses of loved ones and community members. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS Rehabilitation psychologists and other professionals should be aware of the potential for trauma and stress among disabled clients and work with them to mitigate its effects. Additionally, psychologists should also work with the disability community and disabled colleagues to address systemic and institutional ableism and its intersections with other forms of oppression.

METHODS Data were collected for 68 patients who underwent type 7 TLH with adnexectomy. Analyzed variables included patient characteristics (age, body mass index (BMI), parity, medical and surgical history, indications for hysterectomy, weight of the removed uterus), operative data (operative time, procedures performed in addition to TLH, intraoperative blood loss), complications, difference between preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS Mean age was 53.7 ± 6.9 years (range 46-74) and mean body mass index was 27.9 ± 6.1 kg/m(2) (range 19.4-45.7). Overall mean operative time was 100.4 ± 31.7 min (range 60-180), mean intraoperative blood loss was 98.1 ± 96.9 ml (range 0-700), and the mean difference between preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels was 1.39 ± 0.6 g/dl (range 0-3.4). Mean weight of the removed uteruses was 229.4 ± 174.8 g (range 60-750). Mean hospital stay was 1.12 ± 0.7 days (range 1-7). Additional operative procedures included Burch colposuspension (15; 22.1%), adhesiolysis (9; 13.2%), cholecystectomy (2; 2.9%), transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair (1; 1.5%) and repair of intraoperative bladder injury (1; 1.5%). Major intraoperative complications were encountered in two patients. In one, the left ureter was injured and in the other the bladder was injured.

In this study, we used malaria-specific transgenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to track evolution of T cell immunity during the acute and memory phases of P. berghei ANKA infection. Using a combination of techniques, including intravital multiphoton and confocal microscopy and flow cytometric analysis, we showed that, shortly before onset of ECM, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations exit the spleen and begin infiltrating the brain blood vessels. Although dominated by CD8+ T cells, a proportion of both T cell subsets enter the brain parenchyma, where they are largely associated with blood vessels. Intravital imaging shows these cells moving freely within the brain parenchyma. Near the onset of ECM, leakage of RBCs into areas of the brain can be seen, implicating severe damage. If mice are cured before ECM onset, brain infiltration by T cells still occurs, but ECM is prevented, allowing development of long-term resident memory T cell populations within the brain. This study shows that infiltration of malaria-specific T cells into the brain parenchyma is associated with cerebral immunopathology and the formation of brain-resident memory T cells. The consequences of these resident memory populations is unclear but raises concerns about pathology upon secondary infection.","Ghazanfari, Nazanin; Gregory, Julia L; Devi, Sapna; Fernandez-Ruiz, Daniel; Beattie, Lynette; Mueller, Scott N; Heath, William R",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2000773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400523/,478

We report the test results of three children with COVID-19 in a family cluster and assess the results of LAMP tests. The LAMP results of these children showed a sensitivity and specificity of 63.6% and 100%, respectively, that was relative to the RT-PCR results. LAMP tests using nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and RT-PCR were almost consistent throughout hospitalization in the school children, except in the very early stage of infection. The preliminary results suggest that salivary samples would be less sensitive than NPS for LAMP testing in the late stage of infection, and that LAMP would not provide accurate results in neonates.","Kubota, Kei; Nagakura, Ken-Ichi; Ebisawa, Motohiro; Kaneda, Goro; Yanagida, Noriyuki",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.7883/yoken.jjid.2020.1090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34053952/,478

This work is the first to systematically review -following PRISMA guidelines- the empirical evidence regarding the effects of BD on neural activity -assessed by electroencephalography- of adolescents and young adults. A systematic review was conducted in 34 studies (N = 1723). Results indicated that binge drinkers (BDs) showed similar behavioral performance as non/low drinkers. The most solid electrophysiological finding was an augmented P3 amplitude during attention, working memory and inhibition tasks. This increased neural activity suggests the recruitment of additional resources to perform the task at adequate/successful levels, which supports the neurocompensation hypothesis. Similar to alcoholics, BDs also displayed increased reactivity to alcohol-related cues, augmented resting-state electrophysiological signal and reduced activity during error detection -which gives support to the continuum hypothesis. Evidence does not seem to support greater vulnerability to BD in females. Replication and longitudinal studies are required to account for mixed results and to elucidate the extent/direction of the neural impairments associated with BD.","Almeida-Antunes, Natália; Crego, Alberto; Carbia, Carina; Sousa, Sónia S; Rodrigues, Rui; Sampaio, Adriana; López-Caneda, Eduardo",NeuroImage.

At 2-year follow-up the patient had moderate motor delays and mild speech delays, but she continued to meet milestones and her cardiac failure was completely resolved.

This has led to a significant impact on the lives and economy in China and other countries. Here we develop a discrete-time stochastic epidemic model with binomial distributions to study the transmission of the disease. Model parameters are estimated on the basis of fitting to newly reported data from January 11 to February 13, 2020 in China. The estimates of the contact rate and the effective reproductive number support the efficiency of the control measures that have been implemented so far. Simulations show the newly confirmed cases will continue to decline and the total confirmed cases will reach the peak around the end of February of 2020 under the current control measures. The impact of the timing of returning to work is also evaluated on the disease transmission given different strength of protection and control measures.","He, Sha; Tang, San Yi; Rong, Libin",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2020153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32987496/,478

The simulations include both the mechanical and electrical influences of the conducting sensing layer. We show that three-dimensional simulations are necessary because of the out-of-plane displacements of the commonly used (0, 138.5, 26.7) Euler angle. Measurements of the transducer input admittance in reflective delay-line devices yield a value for the electromechanical coupling coefficient that is in good agreement with the three-dimensional simulations on bare langasite substrate. The input admittance measurements also show evidence of excitation of an additional wave mode and excess loss resulting from the finger resistance. The results of these simulations and measurements will be useful in the design of surface acoustic wave gas sensors.","Zheng, Peng; Greve, David W; Oppenheim, Irving J","IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",https://doi.org/10.1109/tuffc.2013.2599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23475923/,478

However, significant international variation exists in risk stratification prior to peanut introduction. RECENT FINDINGS A policy-level screening approach, such as the one in the United States, is not practical and is associated with higher costs and more cases of peanut allergy over time, in contrast to international models that recommend universal early introduction without prescreening. In Australia, population-level efforts to introduce peanut early without screening have demonstrated high rates of peanut introduction before 12 months of age and low rates of severe allergic reactions. In contrast, screening prior to peanut introduction in the United States is associated with 'screening creep' - the tendency of clinicians to test populations where screening is not recommended. SUMMARY Early peanut introduction can reduce the risk of developing food allergy and is more effective without a risk-based screening approach. In some circumstances, shared clinical decision-making can facilitate food allergy prevention in a manner consistent with family values and preferences.","Yuan, Irene; Greenhawt, Matthew; Shaker, Marcus",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1097/mop.0000000000000957; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33060444/,478

We analyzed ligand recognition by the retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I) protein in biochemical assays and in transiently transfected cells and characterized the requirements for both single- and double-stranded RNA agonists for RIG-I activation of signaling. RIG-I mutants such as K270A and T409A/S411A that were defective in signaling with triphosphorylated single-stranded RNAs were perfectly capable of signaling with dsRNAs. Furthermore, phosphorothioated oligodeoxynucleotides were found to antagonize RIG-I signaling. Both agonists and antagonist bind purified RIG-I protein and a truncated RIG-I protein that lacked the signaling domain. The agonists were necessary to activate RIG-I ATPase activity in vitro, whereas antagonist inhibited ATPase activity. Differential scanning fluorometry showed that RIG-I bound to agonists, and antagonists have different denaturation properties, suggesting a difference in protein conformations. Last, single particle reconstruction was used to generate three-dimensional models of the RIG-I dimers in complex with an agonist and an antagonist.

This disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly worldwide, and on March 2020 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Today, more than 9 million people have been infected, with more than 470,000 casualties. Today, no vaccine or antiviral drug is available. While the development of a vaccine might take at least a year, and for a novel drug, even longer; finding a new use to an old drug (drug repurposing) could be the most effective strategy. We present a docking-based screening using a quantum mechanical scoring of a library built from approved drugs and compounds undergoing clinical trials, against three SARS-CoV-2 target proteins: the spike or S-protein, and two proteases, the main protease and the papain-like protease. The S-protein binds directly to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 receptor of the human host cell surface, while the two proteases process viral polyproteins. Following the analysis of our structure-based compound screening, we propose several structurally diverse compounds (either FDA-approved or in clinical trials) that could display antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Clearly, these compounds should be further evaluated in experimental assays and clinical trials to confirm their actual activity against the disease.

125950,Mortality after total hip replacement surgery: A systematic review.,2014,"BACKGROUND Recent studies showed partial reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the pre-Bötzinger complex and the parabrachial nucleus/Kölliker-Fuse complex. The hypothesis for this study was that opioid antagonism in the parabrachial nucleus/Kölliker-Fuse complex plus pre-Bötzinger complex completely reverses respiratory depression from clinically relevant opioid concentrations. METHODS Experiments were performed in 48 adult, artificially ventilated, decerebrate rabbits. The authors decreased baseline respiratory rate ~50% with intravenous, ""analgesic"" remifentanil infusion or produced apnea with remifentanil boluses and investigated the reversal with naloxone microinjections (1 mM, 700 nl) into the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, and pre-Bötzinger complex. In another group of animals, naloxone was injected only into the pre-Bötzinger complex to determine whether prior parabrachial nucleus/Kölliker-Fuse complex injection impacted the naloxone effect. Last, the µ-opioid receptor agonist [d-Ala,2N-MePhe,4Gly-ol]-enkephalin (100 μM, 700 nl) was injected into the parabrachial nucleus/Kölliker-Fuse complex. The data are presented as medians (25 to 75%). RESULTS Remifentanil infusion reduced the respiratory rate from 36 (31 to 40) to 16 (15 to 21) breaths/min. Naloxone microinjections into the bilateral Kölliker-Fuse nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, and pre-Bötzinger complex increased the rate to 17 (16 to 22, n = 19, P = 0.005), 23 (19 to 29, n = 19, P < 0.001), and 25 (22 to 28) breaths/min (n = 11, P < 0.001), respectively. Naloxone injection into the parabrachial nucleus/Kölliker-Fuse complex prevented apnea in 12 of 17 animals, increasing the respiratory rate to 10 (0 to 12) breaths/min (P < 0.001); subsequent pre-Bötzinger complex injection prevented apnea in all animals (13 [10 to 19] breaths/min, n = 12, P = 0.002). Naloxone injection into the pre-Bötzinger complex alone increased the respiratory rate to 21 (15 to 26) breaths/min during analgesic concentrations (n = 10, P = 0.008) but not during apnea (0 [0 to 0] breaths/min, n = 9, P = 0.500). [d-Ala,2N-MePhe,4Gly-ol]-enkephalin injection into the parabrachial nucleus/Kölliker-Fuse complex decreased respiratory rate to 3 (2 to 6) breaths/min. CONCLUSIONS Opioid reversal in the parabrachial nucleus/Kölliker-Fuse complex plus pre-Bötzinger complex only partially reversed respiratory depression from analgesic and even less from ""apneic"" opioid doses. The lack of recovery pointed to opioid-induced depression of respiratory drive that determines the activity of these areas.

Bevezetés: A myeloma multiplex mindmáig alapvetően gyógyíthatatlan betegség, ezért nagy klinikai jelentőségük van az eredményes mentő kezeléseknek. A szájon át adható első proteaszómagátlóval, az ixazomibbal kiegészített lenalidomid-dexametazon terápia jól tolerálható, csak orális szerekből álló kombináció, mely hazánkban 2015 áprilisától kezdődően a ""Named Patient Program"" keretén belül vált elérhetővé relabált, refrakter myeloma multiplexes betegek kezelésére. Célkitűzés: Kutatásunk célja az ixazomib-lenalidomid-dexametazon kezelés mellett a hosszú távon progressziómentes túlélők célzott vizsgálata. Módszer: A program keretében összesen 7 centrumban 80 visszaeső beteg részesült e triplet kezelésben, adataikat retrospektíven elemeztük. Leíró statisztikai és Kaplan-Meier-analízist végeztünk. Eredmények: A betegek nagyobb hányada reagált: 63,75%-os válaszarány mellett 14 (17,5%) betegnél nem volt terápiás válasz/stabil betegség alakult ki, és 15-nél (18,75%) a betegség a kezelés mellett is progrediált. A progressziómentes túlélés a teljes betegcsoportban 10,6 hónapnak adódott, ugyanakkor 16 beteg (18,75%) két éven túl progressziómentesnek bizonyult, sőt közülük 11-nél a betegség még 3 év után sem progrediált. Tanulmányunkban a fenti, hosszú távú túlélő betegcsoport tulajdonságait tárjuk fel. Megbeszélés: A folyamatos terápia a myeloma multiplex kezelésében meghatározóvá vált. Ezért fontos ismernünk, hogy kik lehetnek azok a betegek, akik különösen sokat profitálnak egy bizonyos terápiából. A hosszú távon progressziómentes túlélők között az immunglobulin-nehézláncot érintő transzlokációk vagy triszómiák közül (trend szintjén) az utóbbiak kedvezőbb progressziómentes túléléssel bírtak, de progressziómentes platót mindkét betegcsoportban észleltünk. A betegség tumortömegét mérő nemzetközi stádiumbeosztás (ISS) nem jelezte előre a hosszú túlélést. Gyógyszerelhagyáshoz vezető mellékhatást a hosszú távú túlélő csoportban egyet sem regisztráltunk; az észlelt mellékhatások nagy része enyhe volt. Következtetések: Munkánk során az ixazomib-lenalidomid-dexametazon kombinációt effektívnek és biztonságosnak találtuk relabált, refrakter myeloma multiplex kezelésére, mely a betegek mintegy hatodánál több éven át eredményesen alkalmazható.

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(36): 1451-1458. SUMMARY INTRODUCTION Despite great advances in therapy, multiple myeloma is still a largely incurable disease, therefore the importance of salvage therapies is paramount. The first oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide-dexamethasone is a tolerable, orally administered regime, which has become available for Hungarian relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma patients from April 2015 in the Named Patient Program. OBJECTIVE Our goal was to investigate the long-time progression-free surviving patient population treated with the ixazomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone triplet. METHOD We retrospectively studied a total of 80 patients from 7 centers who received the triplet combination. Survival analyses were performed. RESULTS Two-third of the patients responded: the overall response rate was 63.75%. 14 patients (17.5%) did not respond/had stable disease and 15 patients (18.75%) outright progressed upon therapy. Although progression-free survival was only 10.6 months for the entire patient cohort, the disease in a subgroup of 16 patients did not progress within two years. In fact, 11 of them were still in sustained remission after 3 years of therapy. Our goal was to analyze the characteristics of this subgroup. DISCUSSION The idea of long-term therapy of multiple myeloma is gaining widespread acceptance. Therefore it is important to know which patients may benefit the most from certain therapies. Among these 16 long-term responder patients, reciprocal translocation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain seemed to lack an adverse impact on progression-free survival; comparable to trisomies, both curves had a progression-free plateau. The International Staging System (ISS) score at the start of therapy did not predict long-term survivorship. Most of the side effects in this subgroup were mild, manageable, none led to therapy discontinuation. CONCLUSION Ixazomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone was confirmed to be an effective and safe combination for relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma, and one-sixth of the treated patients were able to receive it for several years, effectively. This fully oral therapeutic option is at its best during the present COVID-19 pandemic.

128225,Dabigatran: patient management in specific clinical settings.,2014,"BACKGROUND Intracranial aneurysm initiation is poorly understood, although hemodynamic insult is believed to play an important role in triggering the pathology. It has recently been found in a rabbit model that while macrophages are absent during hemodynamic aneurysm initiation, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are elevated and co-localize with smooth muscle cells (SMCs). This study investigates whether SMCs play a mechanistic role in aneurysm initiation triggered by hemodynamics. METHODS Aneurysmal damage was induced at the basilar terminus via bilateral common carotid artery ligation in rabbits (n = 45, plus 7 sham controls). 16 ligated rabbits were treated with doxycycline to inhibit MMPs, 7 received clodronate liposomes to deplete circulating monocytes, and the rest received no drug. Effects of the treatments on aneurysm development were assessed histologically 5 days and 6 months after ligation. MMP production and expression of inflammatory markers by SMCs was monitored by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. RESULTS Treatment with doxycycline attenuated aneurysmal development examined at 5 days and 6 months, suggesting that MMPs contribute to aneurysm initiation. However, systemic depletion of macrophages did not decrease MMPs or suppress aneurysmal development. Immunofluorescence showed that during aneurysm initiation MMP-2 and MMP-9 were distributed in SMCs, and in situ hybridization indicated that they were transcribed by SMCs. In regions of early aneurysmal lesion, SMCs exhibited decreased expression of smooth muscle actin and increased NF-κB and MCP-1 expressions. CONCLUSIONS During aneurysm initiation triggered by hemodynamics, SMCs rather than macrophages are responsible for MMP production that is critical for aneurysmal lesion development. These SMCs exhibit proinflammatory behavior.","Mandelbaum, Max; Kolega, John; Dolan, Jennifer M; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Meng, Hui",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0074357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24023941/,478

However, the optimal time point for PFO closure is unknown and depends on the risk of stroke recurrence. Objective: We aimed to investigate risk of early new ischemic lesions on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in cryptogenic stroke patients with and without PFO. Methods: Cryptogenic stroke patients underwent serial MRI examinations within 1 week after symptom onset to detect early new ischemic lesions. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions were delineated, co-registered, and analyzed visually for new hyperintensities by raters blinded to clinical details. A PFO was classified as stroke-related in patients with PFO and a Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) score >5 points. Results: Out of 80 cryptogenic stroke patients, risk of early recurrent DWI lesions was not significantly different in cryptogenic stroke patients with and without PFO. Similar results were observed in patients ≤60 years of age. Patients with a stroke-related PFO even had a significantly lower risk of early recurrent ischemic lesions compared to all other patients with cryptogenic stroke (unadjusted odds ratio 0.23 [95% confidence interval 0.06-0.87], P = 0.030). Conclusion: Our data argue against a high risk of early stroke recurrence in patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO.","Braemswig, Tim Bastian; Usnich, Tatiana; Scheitz, Jan F; Erdur, Hebun; Fiebach, Jochen B; Audebert, Heinrich J; Endres, Matthias; Nolte, Christian H",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2018.00996; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524364/,478

Synchronous communication telemedicine, which involves the use of real time audio and video between patient and provider, is a developing field and its use in the pediatric orthopaedic population is not well defined. To better understand the existing use of and challenges posed by telemedicine for pediatric orthopaedic providers, the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA) practice management committee conducted a survey of current POSNA members. METHODS A 33-question survey was created by the POSNA Practice Management Committee, piloted among committee members and approved by the POSNA Evidence Based Practice Committee. A total of 167 responses were complete (75% complete response rate). Telemedicine use questions referred to the use of synchronous communication telemedicine. RESULTS A total of 50% reported being ""moderately"" or ""not really"" familiar with telemedicine. Sixty percent of study participants reported their hospital systems utilize telemedicine; however, only 40% reported utilizing telemedicine in their own practice. Sixty-seven percent indicated interest in telemedicine training.

We therefore elected to investigate factors that may influence the long-term patency of these covered side branches. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the long-term patency of side branches covered by the Pipeline Embolization Device at our institution during treatment of intracranial aneurysms with at least 6 months of conventional angiography follow-up. Procedural and anatomic factors that might influence the fate of covered side branches were explored. RESULTS One hundred forty-eight Pipeline Embolization Device treatments in 137 patients met the inclusion criteria. In 217 covered side branches, 29 (13.4%) were occluded on follow-up, and 40 (18.4%) were stenotic. All stenoses and occlusions were asymptomatic. In the entire cohort and in the largest subset of ophthalmic arteries, a smaller Pipeline Embolization Device diameter was associated with branch vessel occlusion (P = .001, P = .013). When we considered stenotic and occluded side branches together, smaller Pipeline Embolization Device size (P = .029) and administration of intraprocedural abciximab (P = .03) predicted side branch stenosis/occlusion, while anterior choroidal branch type (P = .003) was a predictor of gross side branch patency. CONCLUSIONS A smaller Pipeline Embolization Device diameter is associated with delayed side branch stenosis/occlusion following Pipeline Embolization Device treatment, likely due to the higher metal density of smaller caliber devices. Although hemodynamic factors, including the potential for collateral flow, are still paramount in determining the fate of covered side branches, the amount of metal coverage at the side branch orifice also plays an important role.","Miller, T R; Kole, M J; Le, E J; Cannarsa, G; Jones, S; Wessell, A P; Jindal, G; Aldrich, E F; Simard, J M; Gandhi, D",AJNR.

130790,"Covid-19 and long term conditions: what if you have cancer, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease?",2020-03-27,"Background Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and bundle-branch block have poor prognoses. The new European Society of Cardiology guideline suggests a primary percutaneous coronary intervention strategy when persistent ischemic symptoms occur in patients with persistent ischemic symptoms and right bundle-branch block (RBBB), but the level of evidence is not high. In fact, the presence of RBBB may lead to the misdiagnosis of transmural ischemia and mask the early diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Moreover, new-onset RBBB is occasionally caused by AMI. Our study aims to investigate the prognostic value of new-onset RBBB in AMI. Methods and Results We conducted a meta-analysis of studies to evaluate the prognostic value of RBBB in AMI patients. Of 914 primary records, five studies and 874 MI patients were included for meta-analysis. Compared with previous RBBB, AMI patients with new-onset RBBB had a higher risk of long-term mortality (RR, 1.66, 95% CI [1.31-2.09], I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.000, n = 2), ventricular arrhythmia (RR, 4.86, 95% CI [2.10-11.27], I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.000, n = 3), and cardiogenic shock (RR, 2.76, 95% CI [1.66-4.59], I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.000, n = 3), but a lower risk of heart failure (RR, 0.66, 95% CI [0.52-0.85], I2 = 2.50%, p = 0.001, n = 4). Compared with AMI patients with new-onset permanent RBBB, patients with new-onset transient RBBB had a lower risk of short-term mortality (RR, 0.20, 95% CI [0.11-0.37], I2 = 44.1%, p = 0.000, n = 4). Conclusion New-onset RBBB is likely to increase long-term mortality, ventricular arrhythmia, and cardiogenic shock, but not heart failure in AMI patients. AMI patients with new-onset transient RBBB have a lower risk of short-term mortality than those with new-onset permanent RBBB. Revascularization therapies should be considered when persistent ischemic symptoms occur in patients with RBBB, especially new-onset RBBB.","Wang, Juntao; Luo, Hongxing; Kong, Chunling; Dong, Shujuan; Li, Jingchao; Yu, Haijia; Chu, Yingjie",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4497; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29576967/,478

Most countries were unprepared for such a rapid spread and crisis. This led to various strategies for effective control of the new pandemic. A key aspect in all countries was to effectively test the population for the virus. Most countries chose a lockdown strategy in which many workplaces and activities are completely closed, leading to substantial economy costs. Here, we present a protocol we recently developed that allows rapid and simple detection of SARS-CoV-2 for the large population, eliminating costs and involvement of professional teams and laboratories. This protocol is based on Reverse Transcribed Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP). We tested this protocol directly on patient samples, both nasal and throat clinical swabs as well as saliva.

OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of ocular and facial injuries in dental professionals and to investigate factors in dental practice contributing to ocular injuries. METHODS An analytical cross-sectional study was performed in public and private sector universities. The study had 301 participants including final year undergraduate students, interns, postgraduate trainees, general practitioners, and dental specialists. Data were gathered online using Google forms. Information on sociodemographic, practice details, history of ocular and facial encounters during the clinical experience, and protective measures adopted by the dentists were collected. Means and standard deviations were calculated for continuous variables whereas frequencies and percentages were calculated for categorical variables. A Chi-square test was applied for association between variables. RESULTS Ocular events and facial injuries occurred more in females 204 (67.8%) than in males 97(32.2%). Final year students reported more incidence of ocular encounters than specialists (40.9%, 3.3%). Dentists working in the government sector underwent more ocular encounters than those in private sectors 185(61.4%) and 96 (31.8%). Majority of participants reported that scaling was the procedure in which dentists experienced an ocular event. A significant association was found between ocular events, qualification, years of experience in clinical practice, number of patients treated per day, improper posture, and proper armamentarium (p < 0.05). However, no association was found between ocular events, gender, working sector, and dental procedures. CONCLUSION Occurrence of ocular injuries were high compared to facial injuries and these outcomes were dependent on dental expertise and experiences. Appropriate measures should be adopted to minimize the risk of disease transmission and COVID-19 through the eyes among practicing dentists.","Anzar, Wajiha; Afaq, Ashar; Baig, Qaiser Ali; Mohamed, Osama Y; Bukhari, Ishfaq A; Vohra, Fahim",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-205101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180445/,478

The present situation demands the countries to scale up their testing and design innovative strategies to conserve diagnostic kits and reagents. The pooling of samples saves time, workforce and most importantly diagnostic kits and reagents. In the present study, we tried to define the pool size that could be applied with acceptable confidence for testing. Materials and Methods We used repeatedly tested positive clinical sample elutes having different levels of SARS CoV 2 RNA and negative sample elutes to prepare seven series of 11 pools each, having pool sizes ranging from 2 to 48 samples to estimate the optimal pool size. Each pool had one positive sample elute in different compositions. All the pools were tested by SARS CoV 2 reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results Out of the 77 pools, only 53 (68.8%) were found positive. The sensitivity of pools of 2-48 samples was decreased from 100% (95% confidence interval [CL]; 98.4-100) to 41.41% (95% CL; 34.9-48.1). The maximum size of the pool with acceptable sensitivity (>95%) was found to be of six samples. For the pool size of six samples, the sensitivity was 97.8% and the efficiency of pooling was 0.38.

131475,Myeloma clinical outcomes following the first wave of COVID-19: results from the Thames Valley Cancer Alliance (UK).,2020-12-16,"Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving intervention for respiratory failure and thus has become the cornerstone of the practice of critical care medicine. A mechanical ventilation mode describes the predetermined pattern of patient-ventilator interaction. In recent years there has been a dizzying proliferation of mechanical ventilation modes, driven by technological advances and market pressures, rather than clinical data. The comparison of these modes is hampered by the sheer number of combinations that need to be tested against one another, as well as the lack of a coherent, logical nomenclature that accurately describes a mode. In this paper we propose a logical nomenclature for mechanical ventilation modes, akin to biological taxonomy. Accordingly, the control variable, breath sequence, and targeting schemes for the primary and secondary breaths represent the order, family, genus, and species, respectively, for the described mode. To distinguish unique operational algorithms, a fifth level of distinction, termed variety, is utilized. We posit that such coherent ordering would facilitate comparison and understanding of modes. Next we suggest that the clinical goals of mechanical ventilation may be simplified into 3 broad categories: provision of safe gas exchange; provision of comfort; and promotion of liberation from mechanical ventilation. Safety is achieved via optimization of ventilation-perfusion matching and pressure-volume relationship of the lungs. Comfort is provided by fostering patient-ventilator synchrony. Liberation is promoted by optimization of the weaning experience. Then we follow a paradigm that matches the technological capacity of a particular mode to achieving a specific clinical goal. Finally, we provide the reader with a comparison of existing modes based on these principles. The status quo in mechanical ventilation mode nomenclature impedes communication and comparison of existing mechanical ventilation modes. The proposed model, utilizing a systematic nomenclature, provides a useful framework to address this unmet need.","Mireles-Cabodevila, Eduardo; Hatipoğlu, Umur; Chatburn, Robert L",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22710796/,478

DESIGN This study uses an incident user cohort design to compare associations between incidence of vascular/bleeding events and the relative affinity (low, moderate or high) of the antidepressant for the serotonin transporter during an exposure risk period for each patient. SETTING New England healthcare system electronic medical record database. PARTICIPANTS 36 389 individuals with a diagnosis of MDD and monotherapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor or other new-generation antidepressant were identified from among 3.1 million patients in a New England healthcare system. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Rates of bleeding or other vascular complications, including acute liver failure, acute renal failure, asthma, breast cancer and hip fractures. RESULTS 601 GI bleeds were observed in the 21 462 subjects in the high-affinity group versus 333 among the 14 927 subjects in the lower affinity group (adjusted RR: 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.34). Similarly, 776 strokes were observed in the high-affinity group versus 434 in the lower affinity treatment group (adjusted RR: 1.18, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.32). No significant association with risk for a priori negative control outcomes, including acute liver failure, acute renal failure, asthma, breast cancer and hip fractures, was identified. CONCLUSIONS Use of antidepressants with high affinity for the serotonin transporter may confer modestly elevated risk for GI and other bleeding complications. While multiple methodologic limitations must be considered, these results suggest that antidepressants with lower serotonin receptor affinity may be preferred in patients at greater risk for such complications.","Castro, Victor M; Gallagher, Patience J; Clements, Caitlin C; Murphy, Shawn N; Gainer, Vivian S; Fava, Maurizio; Weilburg, Jeffrey B; Churchill, Susanne E; Kohane, Isaac S; Iosifescu, Dan V; Smoller, Jordan W; Perlis, Roy H",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22466034/,478

DESIGN An observational study was conducted including preterm infants born with a gestational age (GA) less than 32 weeks treated with non-synchronised nIPPV. During 1 hour, spontaneous breathing was measured with transcutaneous electromyography of the diaphragm simultaneous with ventilator inflations. An asynchrony index (AI), a percentage of asynchronous breaths, was calculated and the incidence of different types of inspiratory and expiratory asynchrony were reported. RESULTS Twenty-one preterm infants with a mean GA of 26.0±1.2 weeks were included in the study. The mean inspiratory AI was 68.3%±4.7% and the mean expiratory AI was 67.1%±7.3%. Out of 5044 comparisons of spontaneous inspirations and mechanical inflations, 45.3% of the mechanical inflations occurred late, 23.3% of the mechanical inflations were early and 31.4% of the mechanical inflation were synchronous. 40.3% of 5127 expiratory comparisons showed an early termination of ventilator inflations, 26.7% of the mechanical inflations terminated late and 33.0% mechanical inflations terminated in synchrony with a spontaneous expiration. In addition, 1380 spontaneous breaths were unsupported and 611 extra mechanical inflations were delivered. CONCLUSION Non-synchronised nIPPV results in high patient-ventilator asynchrony in preterm infants during both the inspiratory and expiratory phase of the breathing cycle. New synchronisation techniques are urgently needed and should address both inspiratory and expiratory asynchrony.","de Waal, Cornelia G; van Leuteren, Ruud W; de Jongh, Frans H; van Kaam, Anton H; Hutten, Gerard J",Archives of disease in childhood.

133454,The COVID pandemic-Potential collateral damage in a less focused dimension.,2020-10-08,"BACKGROUND Fertility in dairy cows depends on ovarian cyclicity and on uterine involution. Ovarian cyclicity and uterine involution are delayed when there is uterine dysbiosis (overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria). Fertility in dairy cows may involve a mechanism through which the uterine microbiota affects ovarian cyclicity as well as the transcriptome of the endometrium within the involuting uterus. The hypothesis was that the transcriptome of the endometrium in postpartum cows would be associated with the cyclicity status of the cow as well as the microbiota during uterine involution. The endometrium of first lactation dairy cows was sampled at 1, 5, and 9 weeks postpartum. All cows were allowed to return to cyclicity without intervention until week 5 and treated with an ovulation synchronization protocol so that sampling at week 9 was on day 13 of the estrous cycle. The endometrial microbiota was measured by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and principal component analysis. The endometrial transcriptome was measured by mRNA sequencing, differential gene expression analysis, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. RESULTS The endometrial microbiota changed from week 1 to week 5 but the week 5 and week 9 microbiota were similar. The endometrial transcriptome differed for cows that were either cycling or not cycling at week 5 and cyclicity status depended in part on the endometrial microbiota. Compared with cows cycling at week 5, there were large changes in the transcriptome of cows that progressed from non-cycling at week 5 to cycling at week 9. There was evidence for concurrent and longer-term associations between the endometrial microbiota and transcriptome. The week 1 endometrial microbiota had the greatest effect on the subsequent endometrial transcriptome and this effect was greatest at week 5 and diminished by week 9. CONCLUSIONS The cumulative response of the endometrial transcriptome to the microbiota represented the combination of past microbial exposure and current microbial exposure. The endometrial transcriptome in postpartum cows, therefore, depended on the immediate and longer-term effects of the uterine microbiota that acted directly on the uterus. There may also be an indirect mechanism through which the microbiome affects the transcriptome through the restoration of ovarian cyclicity postpartum.","Moore, Stephen G; Ericsson, Aaron C; Behura, Susanta K; Lamberson, William R; Evans, Timothy J; McCabe, Matthew S; Poock, Scott E; Lucy, Matthew C",BMC genomics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-5797-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31117952/,478

Few comparison studies between the two techniques exist. The aim was to determine whether the uniportal technique had more favourable postoperative outcomes than the multiport technique. METHODS All VATS lobectomies undertaken at a single university hospital during August 2012 to December 2013 were studied. Patients with preoperative opiate use or chronic pain were excluded. Patients were divided into those with uniportal and multiport approaches for analysis. All continuous data were assessed for normality, and analysed with the Mann-Whitney U-tests or t-tests as appropriate. Categorical data were analysed by Fisher's exact or χ(2) test for trend as appropriate. RESULTS One hundred and twenty-nine VATS lobectomies were completed. Six were excluded and data were incomplete for 13, leaving 110 (15 uniportal, 95 multiport) for analysis. The demographics of the two groups were similar. There was no significant difference in the Thoracoscore or American Society of Anesthesiologists grades. The median morphine use in the first 24 postoperative hours was 19 mg in the uniportal group and 23 mg in the multiport group, P = 0.84. The median visual analogue pain score in the first 24 h was 0 in the uniportal group and 0 in the multiport group, P = 0.65. There was no difference in the duration of patient-controlled analgesia (P = 0.97), chest drain duration (P = 0.67) or hospital length of stay (P = 0.54). There was no inpatient mortality and no unplanned admission to critical care in either group. CONCLUSIONS Uniportal VATS lobectomy is safe, and there is no appreciable negative impact on the hospital stay or morbidity.

However, work remains to be done to establish methods for measuring the value of such data. PURPOSE The purpose of this article is to establish and evaluate a method for measuring the utility of biosurveillance data. METHOD The authors derive an expected utility model in which the value of data may be determined by trading data relevance for time delay in receiving data. In a sample of 23 disease surveillance practitioners, the authors test if such tradeoffs are sensitive to the types of data elements involved (chief complaint v. emergency department [ED] log of visit) and proportional changes to the time horizon needed for receiving data (24 v. 48 h). In addition, they evaluate the logical error rate: the proportion of responses that scored less relevant data as having higher utility. RESULTS Utilities of chief complaints were significantly higher than ED log of visit, F(1, 21)= 5.60, P < 0.05, suggesting the method is sensitive. Further utilities did not depend on time horizon used in the exercise, F(1, 21) = 0.00, P = ns. Of 92 time tradeoffs elicited, there were 5 logical errors (i.e., 5% logical error rate). CONCLUSIONS In this article, the authors establish a time-tradeoff exercise for valuing biosurveillance data. Empirically, the method shows initial promise for evaluating a minimum data set for biosurveillance. Future applications of this approach may prove useful in disease surveillance planning and evaluation.","Doctor, Jason N; Baseman, Janet G; Lober, William B; Davies, Jac; Kobayashi, John; Karras, Bryant T; Fuller, Sherrilynne",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x08317011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18480039/,478
134937,Variable computed tomography appearances of COVID-19.,2020-04-21,"Two members of the paramyxovirus family, Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV), are recent additions to a growing number of agents of emergent diseases which use bats as a natural host. Identification of ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 as cellular receptors for these viruses has enabled the development of immunotherapeutic reagents which prevent virus attachment and subsequent fusion. Here we present the structural analysis of the protein and carbohydrate components of the unbound viral attachment glycoprotein of NiV glycoprotein (NiV-G) at a 2.2-A resolution. Comparison with its ephrin-B2-bound form reveals that conformational changes within the envelope glycoprotein are required to achieve viral attachment. Structural differences are particularly pronounced in the 579-590 loop, a major component of the ephrin binding surface. In addition, the 236-245 loop is rather disordered in the unbound structure. We extend our structural characterization of NiV-G with mass spectrometric analysis of the carbohydrate moieties. We demonstrate that NiV-G is largely devoid of the oligomannose-type glycans that in viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and Ebola virus influence viral tropism and the host immune response. Nevertheless, we find putative ligands for the endothelial cell lectin, LSECtin. Finally, by mapping structural conservation and glycosylation site positions from other members of the paramyxovirus family, we suggest the molecular surface involved in oligomerization.

Text messaging data were abstracted and quantified between January 29, 2020, and April 18, 2020, and the patterns of text messages were analyzed per shift and by provider. RESULTS The survey was completed by 33 of 39 providers (85%). Out of responders, 78% indicated that clinical text messaging frequently or very frequently disrupts critical thinking and workflow. They also felt that the burden of messages was worse during the night shift. Through abstraction, 31 926 text messages were identified. A median of 15 (interquartile range: 12-19) messages per hour were received. A median of 5 messages were received per hour per provider during the day shift and 6 during the night shift. From the entire study period, there were total 2 hours of high-frequency texting (≥15 texts per hour) during the day shift and 68 hours during the night shift. CONCLUSION In our study, providers in the CICU received a large number of texts with a disproportionate burden during the night shift. Text messages are a potential source of cognitive overload for providers. Optimization of text messaging may be needed to mitigate cognitive burden for frontline providers.","Han, Brian; Gal, Dana B; Mafla, Monica; Sacks, Loren D; Singh, Amit T; Shin, Andrew Y",Hospital pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/hpeds.2021-005869; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34497133/,478
135571,Universal Testing for COVID-19 in Essential Orthopaedic Surgery Reveals a High Percentage of Asymptomatic Infections.,2020-06-05,"PURPOSE The main goal of this study was to assess whether maximal fluid infusion improves both oxygen delivery (DO2) and micro-circulatory parameters during hemodilution. The secondary objective was to assess the ability of baseline micro-circulatory parameters to predict oxygen consumption (VO2) response following fluid infusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS In a postoperative cardiac ICU, patients received repeated fluid infusion until stroke volume (SV) was maximized. Before and after each fluid expansion, macro- (DO2, VO2) and micro-circulatory oxygenation parameters were recorded [central venous oxygen saturation (ScVO2), blood lactate, difference in veno-arterial carbon dioxide tension (P(v-a)CO2), somatic and cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2)]. Patients were classified as VO2-Responders or VO2-Non-Responders according to an increase in VO2 above or below 15%, respectively. RESULTS After maximal fluid infusion, all patients showed improved macro- and micro-circulatory oxygenation parameters, but VO2-Responders had lower values (especially for ScVO2 and cerebral rSO2). Only baseline ScVO2 and cerebral rSO2 were useful to predict the VO2 response to maximal fluid infusion (ROCAUC 0.80 (95% CI: 0.54-0.95, P=0.012) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.57-0.96, P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS Maximal fluid infusion improves macro- and micro-circulatory oxygenation parameters. For VO2-Responders, only ScVO2 and cerebral rSO2 could serve as markers of tissue hypoxia.","Fischer, Marc-Olivier; Bonnet, Vincent; Lorne, Emmanuel; Lefrant, Jean-Yves; Rebet, Olivier; Courteille, Benoît; Lemétayer, Charlotte; Parienti, Jean-Jacques; Gérard, Jean-Louis; Fellahi, Jean-Luc; Hanouz, Jean-Luc",Journal of critical care,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2017.03.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28364680/,478
135677,Cardiopulmonary resuscitation after hospital admission with covid-19.,2020-04-06,"OBJECT To summarize the administration model of a COVID-19 designated hospital transformed from a community hospital to improve the emergency capacity of community hospitals and the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment of medical staff in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Analyze the surrounding environment, ward layout, area management, treatment process, medical staff and patient management of the designated community hospital. RESULTS From February 5, 2020, to February 18, 2020, the designated community hospital has received 198 COVID-19 mild and general patients (including 41 in the hospital at the beginning of the period). Among them, 39 were transferred to module hospitals, 131 were discharged, and 28 were in the hospital at the end of the period, and none of them became severe. There were 41 medical staff, and none of them had COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS We have achieved excellent results in the prevention and control stratagems implemented in this new community-designated hospital that specializes in treating patients with COVID-19. Its diagnosis and treatment model has completed the treatment of COVID- 19 patients successfully. After adjustment, this community hospital can shoulder the critical task of being a designated hospital for COVID-19, which includes admission, isolation, and therapy of suspected and mild COVID-19 patients, reducing the medical burden of superior hospitals. Furthermore, our experience provides concepts for community hospitals to temporarily undertake medical responsibilities to reduce the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic.","Zhang, Qifeng; Cheng, Shile; Cheng, Qingzhou",Panminerva medica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0031-0808.20.03908-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32290643/,478

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. The requirement for informed consent was waived. Data were reviewed from 580 patients with HCCs measuring 3 cm or smaller (BCLC stage 0 or A) who underwent ultrasonographically (US) guided percutaneous RF ablation (n = 438) or NAR (n = 142) as a first-line treatment. Local tumor progression, intrahepatic distant recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were analyzed by using propensity score matching to compare therapeutic efficacy. In addition, major complications and length of postoperative hospital stay were compared. RESULTS Before propensity score matching (n = 580), the 5-year cumulative rates of local tumor progression for RF ablation and NAR (20.9% vs 12.7%, respectively; P = .093) and overall survival rates (85.5% vs 90.9%, respectively; P = .194) were comparable, while the 5-year cumulative intrahepatic distant recurrence rates (62.7% vs 36.6%, respectively; P < .001) and disease-free survival rates (31.7% vs 61.1%, respectively; P < .001) in the NAR group were significantly better than those in the RF ablation group. After matching (n = 198), there were no significant differences in therapeutic outcomes between the RF ablation and NAR groups, including 5-year cumulative intrahepatic distant recurrence (47.0% vs 40.2%, respectively; P = .240) and disease-free survival rates (48.9% vs 54.4%, respectively; P = .201). RF ablation was superior to NAR for major complication rates and length of postoperative hospital stay (P < .001). CONCLUSION In patients with one BCLC stage 0 or A (≤ 3 cm) HCC who received RF ablation or NAR as first-line treatment, there were no significant differences in long-term therapeutic outcomes; however, RF ablation was associated with fewer major complications and a shorter hospital stay after treatment.","Kang, Tae Wook; Kim, Jong Man; Rhim, Hyunchul; Lee, Min Woo; Kim, Young-sun; Lim, Hyo Keun; Choi, Dongil; Song, Kyoung Doo; Kwon, Choon Hyuck David; Joh, Jae-Won; Paik, Seung Woon; Paik, Yong Han; Ahn, Joong Hyun",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.15141483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25688888/,478

METHODS On three occasions, nine males completed an intermittent treadmill protocol with an exercise intensity and activity profile simulating a four-set tennis match, with 90-s breaks between odd-numbered games and 120-s breaks between sets, according to International Tennis Federation rules. During breaks, 1) the currently used cooling strategy-an ice-filled damp towel around the neck and a cold-damp towel on the head and thighs (ICE); 2) wetting of arms, neck, face, and lower legs with a sponge in front of an electric fan (FANwet); or 3) no cooling (CON) were applied. Rectal (Tre) and mean skin (Tsk) temperature and HR were measured throughout. Thermal sensation and RPE were assessed during breaks. Trials were terminated upon reaching a Tre ≥ 39.5°C or volitional exhaustion. RESULTS Seven, five, and one participant completed FANwet, ICE, and CON, respectively. By end set 1, ΔTre was lower in FANwet (0.92°C ± 0.15°C) compared with CON (1.09°C ± 0.09°C, P = 0.01), and by end set 2, ΔTre was lower (P < 0.001) in FANwet (1.55°C ± 0.23°C) and ICE (1.59°C ± 0.17°C) compared with CON (1.99°C ± 0.19°C). Mean RPE (FANwet = 13.9 ± 2.2, ICE = 13.6 ± 1.8, CON = 16.6 ± 1.8), HR (FANwet = 163 ± 21, ICE 164 ± 22, CON = 175 ± 19 bpm), Tsk (FANwet = 36.56°C ± 0.69°C, ICE 36.12°C ± 0.44°C, CON = 37.21°C ± 0.42°C), and thermal sensation were lower in FANwet and ICE (P < 0.05) compared with CON by end set 2. CONCLUSIONS The currently recommended ICE strategy successfully mitigates thermal strain during simulated tennis match play in hot/humid conditions. The FANwet intervention is an equally effective alternative that may be more practical in limited resource settings.","Schranner, Daniela; Scherer, Lisa; Lynch, Grant P; Korder, Svenja; Brotherhood, John R; Pluim, Babette M; Périard, Julien D; Jay, Ollie",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000001183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27977528/,478

137469,COVID-19: Limiting the Risks for Eye Care Professionals.,2020-04-20,"Background and aims The randomized controlled trial (RCT) is currently facing several challenges, one of these being that the placebo response appears to be increasing in RCTs, thereby making it difficult to demonstrate an effect of potentially new treatments over placebo. This problem has primarily been approached by predicting the magnitude of the placebo response via stable factors, such as demographic variables, and/or by developing complex designs aimed at reducing the placebo response in the hope that it will improve the test of the active treatment. Yet, the success of this approach has so far been limited. Methods A new approach toward improving the RCT is put forward based on placebo and nocebo mechanism studies, i.e. studies that investigate the mechanisms underlying placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia. In a series of meta-analyses the magnitude of placebo and nocebo effects were determined. Experimental studies across nociplastic and neuropathic pain conditions and across pharmacological and acupuncture treatments investigated psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying these effects. The obtained results were used to make approximations of expectations to see if that could predict the placebo response in RCTs and function as a new way of tapping into the placebo component of treatment effects. Results The magnitude of placebo and nocebo effects is large and highly variable. Placebo effects exist across chronic pain conditions with varying degrees of known etiology as well as across pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. Patients' perception of the treatment, the verbal suggestions given for pain relief, and the patients' expectations toward pain relief contribute to the magnitude of the placebo effect and to pain relief following placebo interventions. Also, unintentional unblinding and patients' perception of a treatment markedly influence the treatment outcome. By making approximations of expectations toward treatment effects it was possible to predict the magnitude of the placebo response in RCTs. Conclusions and implications The new approach of tapping into or directly asking patients about their perception and expectations toward a treatment, along with the account of the natural history of pain, has the potential to improve the information that can be obtained from RCTs. Thus, by interfacing insights from placebo and nocebo mechanism studies, it may be possible to enhance the information that can be obtained from RCTs and to account for a large part of the variability in the placebo component of the overall treatment effect. This approach has the potential to improve the scientific evaluation of treatments, as well as to illustrate how the effect of treatments can be optimized in clinical practice, which is the crux of evidence-based medicine.","Vase, Lene",Scandinavian journal of pain,https://doi.org/10.1515/sjpain-2019-0183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609651/,478

We investigated whether there is an association between AST activity and mortality in IHD patients. METHODS AND RESULTS The study included 6857 patients with coronary angiography-proven IHD and AST activity within the reference range. AST activity measurements were available in all patients. The primary outcome was 3-year cardiac mortality. Patients were categorized in groups according to the AST activity tertiles: a group with AST within the 1st tertile (AST < 17.0 U/L), a group with AST within the 2nd tertile (AST > 17-24.5 U/L) and a group with AST within the 3rd tertile (AST > 24.5 U/L). Cardiac death (n = 297) occurred in 109, 69 and 119 patients in the 1st to 3rd AST tertiles (Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality: 5.3%, 3.6% and 5.9%; univariable hazard ratio [HR] = 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-2.36, P < 0.001 for tertile 3 vs. 2; HR = 1.13 [0.87-1.46], P = 0.370 for tertile 3 vs. 1; and HR = 0.65 [0.48-0.87], P = 0.004 for tertile 2 vs. 1). The association between AST and cardiac mortality was U-shaped. AST values <15 U/L (HR = 1.118 [1.009-1.238]) and >23 U/L (HR = 1.029 [1.003-1.056]) were associated with higher cardiac mortality compared with the reference value (21 U/L). After adjustment, the association between AST and cardiac mortality was attenuated (P = 0.133) but remained non-linear (P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS In patients with IHD, AST activity was associated with the risk of cardiac mortality with a U-shaped relationship. After adjustment, the association between AST and mortality was attenuated.","Ndrepepa, Gjin; Holdenrieder, Stefan; Cassese, Salvatore; Xhepa, Erion; Fusaro, Massimiliano; Laugwitz, Karl-Ludwig; Schunkert, Heribert; Kastrati, Adnan","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.07.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917497/,478

Fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common complication of RA. Whether MTX exposure increases the risk of ILD in patients with RA is disputed. We aimed to evaluate the association of prior MTX use with development of RA-ILD. METHODS Through a case-control study design with discovery and international replication samples, we examined the association of MTX exposure with ILD in 410 patients with chronic fibrotic ILD associated with RA (RA-ILD) and 673 patients with RA without ILD. Estimates were pooled over the different samples using meta-analysis techniques. RESULTS Analysis of the discovery sample revealed an inverse relationship between MTX exposure and RA-ILD (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.90; p=0.022), which was confirmed in the replication samples (pooled adjusted OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.19-0.79; p=0.009). The combined estimate using both the derivation and validation samples revealed an adjusted OR of 0.43 (95% CI, 0.26-0.69; p=0.0006). MTX ever users were less frequent among patients with RA-ILD compared to those without ILD, irrespective of chest high resolution computed tomography pattern. In patients with RA-ILD, ILD detection was significantly delayed in MTX ever users compared to never users (11.4±10.4 years and 4.0±7.4 years, respectively; p<0.001). ANSWER TO THE QUESTION Our results suggest that MTX use is not associated with an increased risk of RA-ILD in patients with RA, and that ILD was detected later in MTX treated patients.","Juge, Pierre-Antoine; Lee, Joyce S; Lau, Jessica; Kawano-Dourado, Leticia; Rojas Serrano, Jorge; Sebastiani, Marco; Koduri, Gouri; Matteson, Eric; Bonfiglioli, Karina; Sawamura, Marcio; Kairalla, Ronaldo; Cavagna, Lorenzo; Bozzalla Cassione, Emanuele; Manfredi, Andreina; Mejia, Mayra; Rodríguez-Henriquez, Pedro; González-Pérez, Montserrat I; Falfán-Valencia, Ramcés; Buendia-Roldán, Ivette; Pérez-Rubio, Gloria; Ebstein, Esther; Gazal, Steven; Borie, Raphaël; Ottaviani, Sébastien; Kannengiesser, Caroline; Wallaert, Benoît; Uzunhan, Yurdagul; Nunes, Hilario; Valeyre, Dominique; Saidenberg-Kermanac'h, Nathalie; Boissier, Marie-Christophe; Wemeau-Stervinou, Lidwine; Flipo, René-Marc; Marchand-Adam, Sylvain; Richette, Pascal; Allanore, Yannick; Dromer, Claire; Truchetet, Marie-Elise; Richez, Christophe; Schaeverbeke, Thierry; Lioté, Huguette; Thabut, Gabriel; Deane, Kevin D; Solomon, Joshua; Doyle, Tracy; Ryu, Jay H; Rosas, Ivan; Holers, V Michael; Boileau, Catherine; Debray, Marie-Pierre; Porcher, Raphaël; Schwartz, David A; Vassallo, Robert; Crestani, Bruno; Dieudé, Philippe",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00337-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32646919/,478

The present study aimed to validate the potential of multispectral imaging in the detection of microcirculatory perfusion disturbances during a vascular occlusion test (VOT). Two consecutive VOT's were performed on healthy volunteers and tissue oxygenation was measured with MSI and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Correlations between the rate of desaturation, recovery and the hyperemic area under the curve (AUC) measured by MSI and NIRS were calculated. Fifty-eight volunteers were included. The MSI oxygenation curves showed identifiable components of the VOT, including a desaturation and recovery slope and hyperemic area under the curve, similar to those measured with NIRS. The correlation between the rate of desaturation measured by MSI and NIRS was moderate: r = 0.42 (p = 0.001) for the first and r = 0.41 (p = 0.002) for the second test. Our results suggest that non-contact multispectral imaging is able to measure changes in regional oxygenation and deoxygenation during a vascular occlusion test in healthy volunteers. When compared to measurements with NIRS, correlation of results was moderate to weak, most likely reflecting differences in physiology of the regions of interest and measurement technique.","Bruins, Arnoud A; Geboers, Diederik G P J; Bauer, Jacob R; Klaessens, John H G M; Verdaasdonk, Rudolf M; Boer, Christa",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-019-00448-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31902095/,478

METHODS Between March 2020 and May 2020, patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the ICU were enrolled in this study. Upon discharge, patients were telephoned and asked to complete a survey related to taste and smell impairment. Characteristics were compared between patients with and without taste and/or smell impairment. RESULTS Fifty-two patients were enrolled (mean age, 61.32 ± 12.53 years; mean ICU stay, 10.19 ± 10.24 days). Age, sex, type/number of comorbid diseases, most ICU support modalities, and ICU stay duration did not significantly differ between groups. Patients in group B required more high-flow nasal oxygen therapy than patients in group A (P = .010). In total, 22 (42.3%) of 52 patients experienced taste and/or smell impairment. Three patients experienced isolated smell impairment and one patient experienced isolated taste impairment. Among the 21 patients who experienced smell impairment, 18 (85.78%) experienced hyposmia (mean visual analog scale [VAS] score: 6.33 ± 0.97), while 3 (14.28%) experienced anosmia. Among the 19 patients who experienced taste impairment, 16 (84.22%) experienced hypogeusia (mean VAS score: 6.43 ± 1.03) and 3 (15.78%) experienced ageuisa.

140447,Does immune privilege result in recovered patients testing positive for COVID-19 again?,2020-05-16,"Influenza remains a global health risk and challenge. Currently, NA inhibitors are extensively used to treat influenza, but their efficacy is compromised by the emergence of drug resistant variants. Neutralizing antibodies targeting influenza A virus surface glycoproteins are critical components of influenza therapeutic agents and may provide alternative strategies to the existing countermeasures. However, the major hurdle for the extensive application of antibody therapies lies in the difficulty of generating non-immunogenic antibodies in large quantities rapidly. Here, we report one human monoclonal antibody (mAb), 53C10, isolated from transchromosomic (Tc) cattle exhibits potent neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition titers against different clades of H1N1 subtype influenza A viruses. In vitro selection of antibody escape mutants reveals that 53C10 recognizes a novel non-continuous epitope in the HA head domain involving three amino acid residues, glycine (G), Serine (S) and glutamic acid (E) at positions172, 207 and 212, respectively. The results of our experiments supported a critical role for substitution of arginine at position 207 (S207R) in mediating resistance to 53C10, while substitutions at either G172E or E212A did not alter antibody recognition and neutralization. The E212A mutation may provide structural stability for the epitope, while the substitution G172E probably compensates for loss of fitness introduced by S207R. Our results offer novel insights into the mechanism of action of mAb 53C10 and indicate its potential role in therapeutic treatment of H1 influenza virus infection in humans.IMPORTANCE Respiratory diseases caused by influenza viruses still pose a serious concern to global health and neutralizing antibodies constitute a promising area of antiviral therapeutics. However, the potential application of antibodies is often hampered by the challenge in generating non-immunogenic antibodies in large scale. In the present study, the transchromosomic (Tc) cattle were used for the generation of non-immunogenic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and characterization of such mAbs revealed one monoclonal antibody 53C10, exhibiting a potent neutralization activity against H1N1 influenza viruses. Further characterization of the neutralization-escape mutant generated using this mAb, showed that three amino acid substitutions in the HA head domain contributed to the resistance. These findings emphasize the importance of Tc cattle in the production of non-immunogenic mAbs and highlight the potential of 53C10 mAb in the therapeutic application against H1 influenza virus infection in humans.","Gao, Rongyuan; Sreenivasan, Chithra C; Sheng, Zizhang; Hause, Ben M; Zhou, Bin; Wentworth, David E; Clement, Travis; Rausch, Dana; Brunick, Colin; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Wu, Hua; Bausch, Christoph L; Sullivan, Eddie J; Hoppe, Adam D; Huber, Victor C; Wang, Dan; Li, Feng",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00945-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32847862/,478
140522,Structural Allograft Versus PEEK Implants in Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion: A Systematic Review.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND The World Health Organization's definition of maternal morbidity refers to ""a negative impact on the woman's wellbeing and/or functioning"". Many studies have documented the, mostly negative, effects of maternal ill-health on functioning. Although conceptually important, measurement of functioning remains underdeveloped, and the best way to measure functioning in pregnant and postpartum populations is unknown. METHODS A cross-sectional study among women presenting for antenatal (N = 750) and postpartum (N = 740) care in Jamaica, Kenya and Malawi took place in 2015-2016. Functioning was measured through the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS-12). Data on health conditions and socio-demographic characteristics were collected through structured interview, medical record review, and clinical examination. This paper presents descriptive data on the distribution of functioning status among pregnant and postpartum women and examines the relationship between functioning and health conditions. RESULTS Women attending antenatal care had a lower level of functioning than those attending postpartum care. Women with a health condition or associated demographic risk factor were more likely to have a lower level of functioning than those with no health condition. However, the absolute difference in functioning scores typically remained modest. CONCLUSIONS Functioning is an important concept which integrates a woman-centered approach to examining how a health condition affects her life, and ultimately her return to functioning after delivery. However, the WHODAS-12 may not be the optimal tool for use in this population and additional components to capture pregnancy-specific issues may be needed. Challenges remain in how to integrate functioning outcomes into routine maternal healthcare at-scale and across diverse settings.","Cresswell, Jenny A; Barbour, Kelli D; Chou, Doris; McCaw-Binns, Affette; Filippi, Veronique; Cecatti, Jose Guilherme; Barreix, Maria; Petzold, Max; Kostanjsek, Nenad; Cottler-Casanova, Sara; Say, Lale",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-020-03216-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894081/,478

Some conventional processes, such as steaming, frying, and boiling, were carried out to study their effect. The results indicated that all of the techniques reduced carbohydrate content. Frying significantly increased the fat content of Kabau and reduced other nutritional components. In general, all the methods significantly reduced phytic acid, tannin, and trypsin inhibitors, as much as 94.95-96.26%, 20-35%, and 89.22-92.88%, respectively.

METHODS Pubmed, Ovid, Embase, SCI database, Cochrane, and Google Scholar were searched. The primary endpoints analyzed were cosmetic result and the postoperative pain (at 6 and 24 h) and the secondary endpoints were operating time, hospital stay, incidence of overall postoperative complications, wound-related complications, and port-site hernia. RESULTS Six hundred fifty-nine patients (SILC-349, CLC-310) were analyzed from nine randomized controlled trials. The objective postoperative pain scores at 6 and 24 h and the hospital stay were similar in both groups. The total postoperative complications, wound-related problems, and port-site hernia formation, though higher in SILC, were also comparable in both groups. SILC had significantly favorable cosmetic scoring compared to CLC [weighted mean difference = 1.0, p = 0.0001]. The operating time was significantly longer in SILC [weighted mean difference = 15.63, p = 0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy does not confer any benefit in postoperative pain (6 and 24 h) and hospital stay as compared to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy while having significantly better cosmetic results at the same time. Postoperative complications, though higher in SILC, were statistically similar in both the groups.","Garg, Pankaj; Thakur, Jai Deep; Garg, Mahak; Menon, Geetha R",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-012-1906-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22580841/,478

However, little is known about their occurrence, genetic diversity and evolutionary history in bats, even though bats are important reservoirs for many emerging viral pathogens. This study screened 380 specimens from 35 bat species from Kenya and Guatemala for the presence of PyVs by semi-nested pan-PyV PCR assays. PyV DNA was detected in 24 of the 380 bat specimens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the bat PyV sequences formed 12 distinct lineages. Full-genome sequences were obtained for seven representative lineages and possessed similar genomic features to known PyVs. Strikingly, this evolutionary analysis revealed that the bat PyVs were paraphyletic, suggestive of multiple species jumps between bats and other mammalian species, such that the theory of virus-host co-divergence for mammalian PyVs as a whole could be rejected. In addition, evidence was found for strong heterogeneity in evolutionary rate and potential recombination in a number of PyV complete genomes, which complicates both phylogenetic analysis and virus classification. In summary, this study revealed that bats are important reservoirs of PyVs and that these viruses have a complex evolutionary history.","Tao, Ying; Shi, Mang; Conrardy, Christina; Kuzmin, Ivan V; Recuenco, Sergio; Agwanda, Bernard; Alvarez, Danilo A; Ellison, James A; Gilbert, Amy T; Moran, David; Niezgoda, Michael; Lindblade, Kim A; Holmes, Edward C; Breiman, Robert F; Rupprecht, Charles E; Tong, Suxiang",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.047928-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23239573/,478

Such drugs might increase the expression of the fundamental receptor of this new infectious agent: the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Preclinical observations indicate that the increase of ACE2 expression or the activity by ACEis and ARBs leads to a greater transformation of angiotensin (Ang)-II to Ang-(1-7), which is associated with positive effects on cardiovascular and pulmonary pathophysiology. This association has been demonstrated in observational studies in patients with cardiovascular pathology and pneumonia. It has not been possible to confirm whether users of ACEis or ARBs are more infected by the new coronavirus, due to methodological issues in studies with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, the use of such antihypertensive treatments in both children and adults might reduce the virulence of infection. Therefore, changes in the antihypertensive therapy of patients at risk of contracting COVID-19 are not recommended.","Vázquez-Cornejo, Edmundo",Boletin medico del Hospital Infantil de Mexico,https://doi.org/10.24875/bmhim.20000158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33064690/,478

We conducted a study to evaluate two academic laboratories' fingerstick capillary blood collection kits suitable for home use for laboratory measurement of HbA1c. Methods: Four clinical sites recruited 240 participants (aged 4-80 years, HbA1c 5.1%-13.5%). Capillary blood samples were obtained by the participant or parent using collection kits from two laboratories (University of Minnesota Advanced Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (ARDL) and Children's Mercy Hospital Laboratory (CMH)) and mailed under varying shipping conditions by United States Postal Service to the laboratories. Comparisons were made between HbA1c measurements from capillary samples and contemporaneously obtained venous samples. The primary outcome was percentage of capillary HbA1c values within 5% of the corresponding venous values. Results: HbA1c values were within 5% of venous values for 96% of ARDL kit specimens shipped with a cold pack and 98% without a cold pack and 99% and 99%, respectively, for the CMH kits. R2 values were 0.98, 0.99, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively. Results appeared similar across HbA1c levels and for pediatric and adult participants. Usability survey scores were high. Conclusions: Capillary blood collection kits, suitable for home use, from two academic laboratories, were demonstrated to be easy to use and provided results that are comparable with those obtained from venous specimens. Based on these results, there is strong evidence that HbA1c measurements from capillary specimens obtained with these specific kits can be used interchangeably with HbA1c measurements from venous specimens for clinical research and clinical care.","Beck, Roy W; Bocchino, Laura E; Lum, John W; Kollman, Craig; Barnes-Lomen, Victoria; Sulik, Mark; Haller, Michael J; Bode, Bruce; Cernich, Joseph T; Killeen, Anthony A; Garg, Uttam; Liljenquist, David; Adams, Janey G; Clements, Margaret; Gabrielson, Deanna; Johnson, Terri; Clements, Mark A",Diabetes technology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1089/dia.2021.0023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33826420/,478
141891,Management of intraoral stents for radiotherapy during COVID-19 pandemic.,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Previous cell-based and animal studies showed mixed tocotrienols are neuroprotective, but the effect is yet to be proven in humans. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the protective activity of mixed tocotrienols in humans with white matter lesions (WMLs). WMLs are regarded as manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease, reflecting varying degrees of neurodegeneration and tissue damage with potential as a surrogate end point in clinical trials. METHODS A total of 121 volunteers aged ≥35 years with cardiovascular risk factors and MRI-confirmed WMLs were randomized to receive 200 mg mixed tocotrienols or placebo twice a day for 2 years. The WML volumes were measured from MRI images taken at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years using a validated software and were compared. Fasting blood samples were collected for full blood chemistry investigation. RESULTS According to per-protocol (88 volunteers) and intention-to-treat (121 volunteers) analyses, the mean WML volume of the placebo group increased after 2 years, whereas that of the tocotrienol-supplemented group remained essentially unchanged. The mean WML volume change between the 2 groups was not significantly different (P=0.150) at the end of 1 year but was significant at the end of 2 years for both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses (P=0.019 and P=0.018). No significant difference was observed in the blood chemistry parameters between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS Mixed tocotrienols were found to attenuate the progression of WMLs.

For this purpose, allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were the areas chosen for further discussion. RECENT FINDINGS The role of allergy as a major immunopathologic mechanism causing inflammation in pediatric rhinosinusitis is becoming better defined. However, despite the fact that allergic rhinitis and CRS are characterized by inflammation, there appears to be a distinct difference in the inflammatory response of children and adults with CRS, which may attest to a difference in the pathophysiologic pathways. Local allergic rhinitis, a recently described pathological entity, appears to affect a significant number of patients with a previous diagnosis of nonallergic rhinitis, making this a prevalent entity in patients evaluated with rhinitis. With regard to the relationships between allergy and infectious diseases, it has been reported that basophils are activated in the presence of suboptimal doses of allergens and bacteria and may explain the clinical behavior of allergy exacerbation. SUMMARY Allergic rhinitis is frequently associated with CRS. The management of CRS should include evaluation of the pediatric patient for allergic disease and the management should be targeted at decreasing the inflammatory response, which will most likely result in better control of the CRS patient.","Veling, Maria C",Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/moo.0b013e32835fb399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23481372/,478

Crucially, improved information handling capabilities have allowed concepts such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to enter the research world. The Covid-19 pandemic has shown how quickly information can be generated and analysed using such approaches, but also showed its limitations. This review will look at how ""omics"" has begun to be translated into clinical practice. While there appears almost limitless potential in using big data for ""precision"" or ""personalised"" medicine, the reality is that this remains largely aspirational. Oncology is the only field of medicine that is widely adopting such technologies, and even in this field uptake is irregular. There are practical and ethical reasons for this lack of translation of increasingly affordable techniques into the clinic. Undoubtedly there will be increasing use of large datasets from traditional (e.g. tumour samples, patient genomics) and non-traditional (e.g. smartphone) sources.

Due to their complexity, an in-depth TE characterization is only available for a handful of model organisms. In the present study, we performed a de novo and homology-based characterization of TEs in the genomes of 24 mosquito species and investigated their mode of inheritance. More than 40% of the genome of Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus is composed of TEs, varying substantially among Anopheles species (0.13%-19.55%). Class I TEs are the most abundant among mosquitoes and at least 24 TE superfamilies were found. Interestingly, TEs have been extensively exchanged by horizontal transfer (172 TE families of 16 different superfamilies) among mosquitoes in the last 30 million years. Horizontally transferred TEs represents around 7% of the genome in Aedes species and a small fraction in Anopheles genomes. Most of these horizontally transferred TEs are from the three ubiquitous LTR superfamilies: Gypsy, Bel-Pao and Copia. Searching more than 32,000 genomes, we also uncovered transfers between mosquitoes and two different Phyla-Cnidaria and Nematoda-and two subphyla-Chelicerata and Crustacea, identifying a vector, the worm Wuchereria bancrofti, that enabled the horizontal spread of a Tc1-mariner element among various Anopheles species. These data also allowed us to reconstruct the horizontal transfer network of this TE involving more than 40 species. In summary, our results suggest that TEs are frequently exchanged by horizontal transfers among mosquitoes, influencing mosquito's genome size and variability.","de Melo, Elverson Soares; Wallau, Gabriel Luz",PLoS genetics,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33253164/,478

To characterize statewide seroprevalence and point prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Rhode Island.Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of randomly selected households across Rhode Island in May 2020. Antibody-based and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests for SARS-CoV-2 were offered. Hispanics/Latinos and African Americans/Blacks were oversampled to ensure adequate representation. Seroprevalence estimations accounted for test sensitivity and specificity and were compared according to age, race/ethnicity, gender, housing environment, and transportation mode.Results. Overall, 1043 individuals from 554 households were tested (1032 antibody tests, 988 PCR tests). The estimated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 2.1% (95% credible interval [CI] = 0.6, 4.1). Seroprevalence was 7.5% (95% CI = 1.3, 17.5) among Hispanics/Latinos, 3.8% (95% CI = 0.0, 15.0) among African Americans/Blacks, and 0.8% (95% CI = 0.0, 2.4) among non-Hispanic Whites. Overall PCR-based prevalence was 1.5% (95% CI = 0.5, 3.1).Conclusions. Rhode Island had low seroprevalence relative to other settings, but seroprevalence was substantially higher among African Americans/Blacks and Hispanics/Latinos. Rhode Island sits along the highly populated northeast corridor, making our findings broadly relevant to this region of the country.

147484,Comparison of Phenotypic Characteristics and Prognosis Between Black and White Patients in a Tertiary ALS Clinic.,2020-12-28,"BACKGROUND The pipeline embolization device (PED) provides effective, durable and safe endovascular reconstruction of large and giant intracranial aneurysms. However, 80% of all cerebral aneurysms found in the general population are less than 10 mm in size. Treatment of small aneurysms (<10 mm) with flow diverters may be advantageous over endosaccular modalities that carry risks of procedural rupture during aneurysm access or coil placement. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed a prospective, single-center aneurysm database to identify all patients with small (<10 mm) internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms who underwent endovascular treatment using the PED. Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, procedural details, complications, and technical and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Forty-four cases were performed in 41 patients (age range 31-78 years). PED was successfully implanted in 42 cases. A single PED was used in 37/42 (88%) cases. Mean postprocedure hospital stay was 1.7 ± 0.3 days and 98% of patients were discharged home. Major complication occurred in one patient (2.3%), who died of early subarachnoid hemorrhage. Transient neurological deficit, delayed intracerebral hemorrhage (asymptomatic), and delayed groin infection occurred in one patient each. Follow-up rate was 91.8% (45 aneurysms in 35 patients) with a mean follow-up of 4.0 ± 1.9 months. By 6 months post-PED implantation, angiographic success (complete or near complete aneurysm occlusion) was observed in 80%. Mild (<50%), asymptomatic, nonflow limiting in-stent stenosis was observed in 5.4% (2/37 cases). All the 35 patients with follow-up remained at preprocedure neurological baseline. CONCLUSION Small (<10 mm) ICA aneurysm treatment with PED implantation is safe and carries a high rate of early angiographic success.","Lin, Li-Mei; Colby, Geoffrey P; Kim, Jennifer E; Huang, Judy; Tamargo, Rafael J; Coon, Alexander L",Surgical neurology international,https://doi.org/10.4103/2152-7806.117711; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24083050/,478
147992,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Psychiatric Sequelae in South Africa: Anxiety and Beyond.,2020-07-01,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Obesity and psoriasis represent chronic inflammatory states that are interconnected in a vicious cycle, sharing also a degree of synergy. In this review, we aim to decipher the various lines of evidence supporting the bidirectional association between psoriasis and obesity highlighting their pathophysiologic connections as well as we attempt to strategize a therapeutic holistic approach for obese psoriatic patients. RECENT FINDINGS Recent meta-analyses have shown that (1) genetically higher BMI increased the odds of psoriasis occurrence; (2) obesity is associated with higher incidence and prevalence of psoriasis as well as psoriasis severity; (3) obesity is associated with lower efficacy to anti-TNF agents and may predict biologic treatment discontinuation; and (4) weight loss through diet and physical exercise may improve pre-existing psoriasis and prevent from de novo psoriasis. Methotrexate, acitretin, and cyclosporine could worsen hypertension, liver steatosis, and dyslipidemia. Since infliximab and ustekinumab are weight adjusted, they may be ideal drugs to treat obese psoriatic patients. IL-17 inhibitors are very effective independently from body weight; however, they tend to present better clearance rates in normal weight patients. There is a paucity on weight data regarding the efficacious IL-23 inhibitors. Apremilast may induce weight loss as an adverse effect presenting also some beneficial metabolic actions. Finally, simvastatin and some antidiabetic drugs could decrease psoriasis severity. More mechanistic, observational studies and well-conducted RCTs are necessary to decipher the enigmatic link between psoriasis and obesity, and to provide evidence-based specific guidelines for the screening and management of obese psoriatic patients.","Paroutoglou, Kyriaki; Papadavid, Evangelia; Christodoulatos, Gerasimos Socrates; Dalamaga, Maria",Current obesity reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13679-020-00380-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418186/,478

METHODS Human retinas were collected from 8 donors who had been clinically diagnosed and treated for glaucoma, and from 9 control donors. Immunohistochemical analysis for BDNF and TrkB was performed. The percent of each retina expressing BDNF and TrkB was quantified for the total retinal thickness, and separately for the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) complex + retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). The expression of each protein was correlated with clinical outcomes obtained from the subject's ocular histories. RESULTS There was no significant difference in BDNF or TrkB expression when comparing glaucomatous and control retinas. Correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between BDNF expression and the use of prostaglandin analogs. TrkB expression was highly correlated with the last-measured intraocular pressure (IOP), the use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, the use of beta blockers, and the total number of drugs used for the treatment of glaucoma. CONCLUSION Topical drugs used to treat glaucoma were associated with an increase in retinal BDNF and TrkB expression in human retina, independent of IOP, which may represent molecular evidence of neuroprotective pathway activation.","Harper, Matthew M; Boese, Erin A; Kardon, Randy H; Ledolter, Johannes; Kuehn, Markus H",Current eye research,https://doi.org/10.1080/02713683.2020.1822417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985274/,478
148459,Biobanking of Specimens from COVID-19 Patients: An Economic Perspective from a Clinical Biobank.,2021-05-19,"Background Despite being sexually active and engaging in risky sexual behaviours similar to young adults, older adults (50 years or older) are less likely to receive HIV testing, and disaggregated data are still scarce about HIV prevention and treatment in this vulnerable population in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This systematic review is aimed at examining sex differences in HIV testing and counseling (HTC) among older adults in SSA. Methods A systematic search of four databases, namely, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), Web of Science, and Global Health, was conducted from 2000 to January 2020. The primary outcome of interest for this study was gender differences in HTC among older adults in SSA. Observational studies including cross-sectional, retrospective, and prospective cohort studies were included. Eligible studies must have reported sex differences in HIV testing uptake in a standard HTC service among older adults in SSA. Results From the database search, 4143 articles were identified. Five studies were ultimately included in the final review. Of the 1189 participants, 606 (51.1%) and 580 (48.9%) were female and male, respectively. The review findings suggested that both men and women preferred HTC providers that are the same sex as them with women additionally preferring a provider who is also of a similar age. Men and women differed in their pathways to getting tested for HIV. The review documented mixed results with regard to the associations between sex of older adults and uptake of HTC. Older adult HTC uptake data are limited in scope and coverage in sub-Saharan Africa. Conclusion This review revealed shortage of evidence to evaluate optimum HTC utilization among older adults. Few studies examined sex differences in HIV testing among older adults in the region. There is a need for stakeholders working in the area of HIV prevention and treatment to focus on older adult health utilization evidence organization, disaggregated by age and sex. Hence, high-quality research designs are needed on the topic in order to generate good quality evidence for targeted interventions to improve HTC among older adults in sub-Saharan Africa.","Gebremeskel, Akalewold T; Gunawardena, Nathali; Omonaiye, Olumuyiwa; Yaya, Sanni",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5599588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34513993/,478
148506,Pericardial effusion and COVID-19.,2021-02-18,"INTRODUCTION The main points to consider in secondary alveolar bone grafting (ABG) of cleft patients are age at the time of surgery, the type of bone graft, and pre/postorthodontic expansion of the upper jaw. PURPOSE The aim of this study is to evaluate the reverse quad-helix (RQH) expander device. Does RQH improve the surgical procedure before ABG? We will evaluate the outcome of the procedure, duration of the operation, hospitalization time, satisfaction of the surgeon with this procedure and the success of the bone graft in the long-term. PATIENTS AND METHODS We reviewed the medical records of 103 cleft patients who underwent secondary bone grafting at our institution between 2001 and 2012. All patients were treated presurgically with a RQH appliance to expand the cleft area. The following data were recorded for each of the patients: Unilateral/bilateral cleft, surgery time, hospital stay, success/failure, and follow-up. CONCLUSION Presurgical orthodontic application of the RQH expander in the cleft area enabled improved anterior expansion rather than posterior expansion. This technique improves access for surgery and bone grafting, the use of RQH facilitates the improved manipulation of the nasal mucosa via direct view due to the wide separation of the alveolar segments in the cleft area. Furthermore, this gap enables improved access for the bone grafting procedure, shortens the surgery time and provides stable maxillary transverse correction.","Emodi, Omri; Noy, Dani; Hazan-Molina, Hagai; Aizenbud, Dror; Rachmiel, Adi",Annals of maxillofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.4103/2231-0746.161056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26389031/,478

However, there is growing evidence that the trajectory of recovery following intracerebral haemorrhage may differ significantly from that following ischaemic stroke. A better understanding of current approaches to outcome assessment is essential to ensure that future trials examining treatments for intracerebral haemorrhage are designed appropriately. OBJECTIVE To determine when and how outcomes are measured in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage. METHODS AND ANALYSIS With the assistance of an information specialist, we will conduct a scoping review by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science for prospective studies of adults with primary intracerebral haemorrhage and documented outcomes with specified times. Two reviewers will independently collect data on included studies pertaining to publication data, study population information, timing of outcome and details of the outcome measurement tools used. The extracted data will be used to demonstrate the type and timing of outcome measures. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Primary data will not be collected therefore formal ethics is not required.

Customs officers are considered as 'high-demand' and 'high-responsibility' governmental officials, which constitute members of multidisciplinary teams at the local, as well as international level and collaborate with different authorities, including medical officers. Despite limited data in the medical literature, customs officers are considered as a 'high-risk' occupational group for infections and environmental health risk. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza A/H1N1 pandemic outbreaks in 2003 and 2009, respectively, customs officers had a fundamental front-line input in the establishment of the recommended at that time border measures. In Belgium in 1994, a psittacosis outbreak occurred in customs officers following their exposure to illegally imported parakeets. During the recent increased immigration proceedings, customs officers have been involved in detaining unauthorized populations for various infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, varicella and measles. Occupational risk for customs officers also includes noise-induced hearing loss, exposure to diesel engine emission and stored tobacco and occupational stress due to their increased time-schedule and decision-making duties. In this review, we discuss customs officers' occupational risk towards environmental and infectious factors, including viral infections, tuberculosis and psittacosis.","Mamma, Maria; Spandidos, Demetrios A",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2018.7077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679987/,478

GA may improve catheter stability and mapping system accuracy compared to CS, but its influence on contact force (CF) parameters during ipsilateral PVI has not previously been investigated. The study population comprised 176 consecutive patients (107 in GA group and 69 in CS group) with AF who underwent their first PVI procedure. We retrospectively assessed CF parameters, force-time integral (FTI), FTI/wall thickness during anatomical ipsilateral PVI and long-term outcome after ablation. Complete PVI with single continuous circular lesions around the ipsilateral PVs was achieved in 54 patients (50.5%) in the GA group but only 24 patients (34.8%) in the CS group (P = 0.04). The distribution of gaps did not differ between the groups. All CF parameters were significantly higher in the GA group than in the CS group (average CF: 19.4 ± 8.7 vs. 16.7 ± 7.7 g, P < 0.0001; FTI: 399.0 ± 262.5 vs. 293.9 ± 193.4 gs, P < 0.0001; FTI/wall thickness: 155.5 ± 106.1 vs. 115.7 ± 85.5 gs, P < 0.0001).

While biochemical parameters were within the reference range, the cat had leukocytosis and rapidly decreasing haematocrit values, and eventually died 7 days after the sudden onset of aggravating clinical signs. From blood samples of the cat 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum' was identified by molecular methods, according to its 100% 16S rRNA gene sequence homology with two Swiss isolates and one isolate from the UK. The rapid termination of the disease and the high pathogenicity of the causative agent observed in this case are unusual, taking into account that PCR results were negative for immunosuppressive viruses.

154893,Telemedicine in Orthopaedic Surgery: Challenges and Opportunities.,2020-05-25,"Opioid overdose is the leading cause of death for Americans 25 to 64 years of age, and opioid use disorder affects >2 million Americans. The epidemiology of opioid-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United States is changing rapidly, with exponential increases in death resulting from synthetic opioids and linear increases in heroin deaths more than offsetting modest reductions in deaths from prescription opioids. The pathophysiology of polysubstance toxidromes involving opioids, asphyxial death, and prolonged hypoxemia leading to global ischemia (cardiac arrest) differs from that of sudden cardiac arrest. People who use opioids may also develop bacteremia, central nervous system vasculitis and leukoencephalopathy, torsades de pointes, pulmonary vasculopathy, and pulmonary edema. Emergency management of opioid poisoning requires recognition by the lay public or emergency dispatchers, prompt emergency response, and effective ventilation coupled to compressions in the setting of opioid-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Effective ventilation is challenging to teach, whereas naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can be administered by emergency medical personnel, trained laypeople, and the general public with dispatcher instruction to prevent cardiac arrest. Opioid education and naloxone distributions programs have been developed to teach people who are likely to encounter a person with opioid poisoning how to administer naloxone, deliver high-quality compressions, and perform rescue breathing. Current American Heart Association recommendations call for laypeople and others who cannot reliably establish the presence of a pulse to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation in any individual who is unconscious and not breathing normally; if opioid overdose is suspected, naloxone should also be administered. Secondary prevention, including counseling, opioid overdose education with take-home naloxone, and medication for opioid use disorder, is important to prevent recurrent opioid overdose.","Dezfulian, Cameron; Orkin, Aaron M; Maron, Bradley A; Elmer, Jonathan; Girotra, Saket; Gladwin, Mark T; Merchant, Raina M; Panchal, Ashish R; Perman, Sarah M; Starks, Monique Anderson; van Diepen, Sean; Lavonas, Eric J",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000000958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33682423/,478

Anatomical models have also been used to assist in teaching. Of these, traditional plastic models have been shown to be effective educational tools, yet have significant drawbacks such as a lack of anatomical detail and texturisation. Three-dimensional (3D) printed models stand to solve these problems and widen access to high-quality anatomical teaching. This paper outlines the use of 3D multi-planar imaging (CT and MRI) as a framework to develop an accurate model of the retroperitoneum. CT and MRI scans were used to construct a virtual 3D model of the retroperitoneum. This was printed locally as a full-size colour model for use in medical education. We give a complete account of the processes and software used. This study is amongst the first of a series in which we will document the newly formed Oxford Library of Anatomy. This series will provide the methodology for the production of models from CT and MRI scans, and the Oxford Library of Anatomy will provide a complete series of some of the most complex anatomical areas and ones which degrade quickly when a real cadaver is being used. In our own internal experience, the models are highly accurate, reproducible and durable, as compared to prosected specimens.

This was a cross-sectional nationwide study based on data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), conducted in 2015-2016, with 9,412 individuals 50 years or older. Multimorbidity was defined as ≥ 2 chronic conditions based on a list of 15 diseases considered risk conditions for severe COVID-19. The analyses included calculation of prevalence and estimation of the absolute number of persons in the population at risk. Self-rated health status, frailty, and basic activities of daily living were used as markers of health status. Sex, age, region of the country, and schooling were used as covariables. Some 80% of the sample had at least one of the target conditions, which represents some 34 million individuals. Multimorbidity was reported by 52% of the study population, with higher proportions in the Central, Southeast, and South of Brazil. Cardiovascular diseases and obesity were the most frequent chronic conditions. An estimated 2.4 million Brazilians are at serious health risk. The results revealed inequalities according to schooling. The number of persons 50 years or older who presented risk conditions for severe COVID-19 is high both in absolute and relative terms. The estimate is important for planning strategies to monitor persons with chronic conditions and for preventive strategies to deal with the novel coronavirus.","Nunes, Bruno Pereira; Souza, Ana Sara Semeão de; Nogueira, Januse; Andrade, Fabíola Bof de; Thumé, Elaine; Teixeira, Doralice Severo da Cruz; Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda; Facchini, Luiz Augusto; Batista, Sandro Rodrigues",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00129620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33237250/,478
155439,Re-examining the Association Between E-Cigarette Use and Myocardial Infarction: A Cautionary Tale.,2021-07-22,"PURPOSE A multi-electrode array was used to generate spatially resolved Surface electromyography (SEMG) data of the hip muscles in healthy older adults. The cohort was meant to serve as an age-matched, normal control population for future surgical and rehabilitative studies in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty, in view of the large, continuously increasing number of hip joint replacements. METHODS Bilateral hip muscle SEMG activity, including tensor fasciae latae (TFL), gluteus medius (Gmed), and gluteus maximus (Gmax), was measured during locomotion on a walkway at self-selected slow, normal, and fast walking speeds (age-matched cohort of 29 females and 25 males). Eight equally-spaced, vertically oriented bipolar channels were applied on a horizontal line at mid-distance between iliac crest and greater trochanter (length 17.5 cm; named P1 to P8). Time-independent parameters (e.g., mean amplitude) were derived from the amplitude curves expressed as root mean square. RESULTS The acquired SEMG data were not significantly influenced by gender (p = 0.202) or side (p = 0.313) and were therefore pooled. The most ventral to central electrode positions P1 to P5, representing TFL and ventral to central Gmed, showed the highest mean amplitude levels (averaged over the whole stride; 0.001 < p < 0.027 against P6 to P8; Bonferroni-adjusted paired t-test) at all walking speeds. Also, the respective curves showed two distinct amplitude peaks (representing load acceptance and hip stabilization during mid-stance), with a continuous increase of the first peak from P1 to P4 (most pronounced at fast speed) and the second peak from P1 to P3. Independently of the underlying individual muscles, both peaks displayed a continuous time shift from the most dorsal P8 to the most ventral P1 position, with the peaks for the ventral positions occurring at later time points during the normalized stride. CONCLUSIONS The continuously changing activation patterns of the superficial muscles in the gluteal region during walking may reflect function-driven, finely tuned coordination patterns of neighboring muscles and muscle segments, rather than independent activation of anatomically defined muscles. This may be important for the definition of specific target parameters for the improvement and/or normalization of muscle function during training and post-injury rehabilitation.","Anders, Christoph; Patenge, Steffen; Sander, Klaus; Layher, Frank; Biedermann, Uta; Kinne, Raimund W",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0178957; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28582456/,478

Our aim was to examine differences in the association between oral health status and social isolation among older people by comparing Japan and England. We used cross-sectional information obtained from adults aged 65+ in two ongoing prospective cohort studies: The Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES, N = 120,195) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA, N = 3,958). The dependent variable, social isolation score (SIS) was calculated from five factors (marital status, social support from children, social support from family, social support from friends, and social participation). The independent variables were self-reported number of remaining teeth (0, 1-9, 10-19, ≥20) and denture use (≥20 teeth, 10-19 teeth with denture, 10-19 teeth without denture, 0-9 teeth with denture, 0-9 teeth without denture), while the covariates in the model were: sex, age, educational attainment, self-rated health, number of comorbidities, household annual equivalized income, mental health status, daily living activities, and smoking status. We examined associations between oral health status and SIS by applying an ordered logit model by country. Compared to England, more Japanese participants were socially isolated (1.4% vs. 5.8%), but fewer were edentulous (13.1% vs. 7.7%).

EEG is a sensitive method for detecting neurophysiological changes in the brain and represents an important frontier in the monitoring and treatment of patients in the perioperative period. In this review, we briefly introduce the essential principles of EEG. We review EEG application during anesthesia practice in the operating room, including the use of processed EEG in depth of anesthesia assessment, raw EEG monitoring in recognizing brain states under different anesthetic agents, the use of EEG in the prevention of perioperative neurocognitive disorders and detection of cerebral ischemia. We then discuss EEG utilization in the intensive care units, including the use of EEG in sedative level titration and prognostication of clinical outcomes. Existing literature provides insight into both the advances and challenges of the clinical applications of EEG. Future study is clearly needed to elucidate the precise EEG features that can reliably optimize perioperative care for individual patients.","Sun, Yi; Wei, Changwei; Cui, Victoria; Xiu, Meihong; Wu, Anshi",Frontiers in medicine,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32582735/,478

Of particular concern is the impact of COVID-19 in low-income settings-especially in terms of their capacity to mitigate a surge in COVID-19 cases. Indeed, response measures currently in place to tackle the spread of COVID-19 in geographic regions predominantly consisting of low-income nations, such as Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), remain tenuous and will require context-appropriate interventions. Control measures to tackle COVID-19 in SSA should therefore be informed through lessons learned from past outbreaks and emergencies on the continent. These lessons will represent a key source of guidance for the strategic implementation and promotion of public health interventions to assist scale-up of COVID-19 case management, infection prevention and control. Importantly, as governments in SSA continue to combat the spread of COVID-19, there will be a need to expand the coverage of social safety net programs and fiscal policy responses to tackle the socio-economic and health impact of COVID-19.","Bitanihirwe, Byron K Y; Ssewanyana, Derrick",Global health promotion,https://doi.org/10.1177/1757975920977874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33302803/,478
158163,Oncology Patients' Perspectives on Remote Patient Monitoring for COVID-19.,2021-06-04,"Type III CRISPR-Cas systems initiate an intracellular signaling pathway to confer immunity. The signaling pathway includes synthesis of cyclic oligo-adenylate (cOA) and activation of the RNase activity of type III accessory ribonuclease Csm6/Csx1 by cOA. After the immune response, cOA should be cleared on time to avoid constant cellular RNA degradation. In this study, we find a metal-dependent cOA degradation activity in Sulfolobus islandicus. The activity is associated with the cell membrane and able to accelerate cOA clearance at a high cOA level. Further, we show that a metal-dependent and membrane-associated DHH-DHHA1 family nuclease (MAD) rapidly cleaves cOA and deactivates Csx1 ribonuclease. The cOA degradation efficiency of MAD is much higher than the cellular ring nuclease. However, the subcellular organization may prevent it from degrading nascent cOA. Together, the data suggest that MAD acts as the second cOA degrader after the ring nuclease to remove diffused redundant cOA.","Zhao, Ruiliang; Yang, Yang; Zheng, Fan; Zeng, Zhifeng; Feng, Wenqian; Jin, Xuexia; Wang, Jiayi; Yang, Ke; Liang, Yun Xiang; She, Qunxin; Han, Wenyuan",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937129/,478

Existing literature has demonstrated feasibility and acceptance of neuropsychological measures administered by videoconference, although few studies have examined feasibility and patient acceptance of TNP visits directly to patients' homes (DTH-TNP). METHODS We modified a previously published patient satisfaction survey for DTH-TNP and developed a clinician feasibility survey to examine experiences during DTH-TNP. RESULTS Seventy-two patients (age range: preschool-geriatric) evaluated by DTH-TNP for cognitive problems at an academic medical center responded to voluntary surveys between April 20, 2020, and August 19, 2020, and 100% indicated satisfaction. Fifty-nine percent of patients reported limitations (e.g., technological concern) during the appointment. 134 clinician surveys were collected and indicated that clinicians achieved the goal of their appointment in 90% of encounters. CONCLUSIONS These qualitative data suggest that patients and clinicians found DTH-TNP to be satisfactory during the COVID-19 pandemic, while also recognizing limitations of the practice. These results are limited in that voluntary surveys are subject to bias. They support the growing body of literature suggesting that DTH-TNP provides a valuable service, though additional research to establish reliability and validity is needed.","Parsons, Michael W; Gardner, Melissa M; Sherman, Janet C; Pasquariello, Kathryn; Grieco, Julie A; Kay, Christina D; Pollak, Lauren E; Morgan, Amy K; Carlson-Emerton, Britt; Seligsohn, Karen; Davidsdottir, Sigurros; Pulsifer, Margaret B; Zarrella, Giuliana V; Burstein, Sarah M; Mancuso, Sarah M",Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1355617721000436; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33952375/,478

Recent clinical trials have assessed whether botanical fermented foods (BFFs) have beneficial effects on metabolic biomarkers, inflammatory markers and gut microbiota. The aim of this review is to critically evaluate all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of BFF for evidence of impact on the outcome measures of these disease states. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Four electronic databases (Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL and Google Scholar) as well as the grey literature will be searched from inception to present without language or publication status restrictions applied. Eligible RCTs which have enrolled adult participants with T2DM, any MetS components or combinations of these components, treated prophylactically or therapeutically with any botanical fermented food intervention, compared with a control group (no intervention, placebo or active control) will be assessed. Primary outcomes are related to the target conditions, including metabolic biomarkers, inflammatory markers and gut microbiota composition/function. Using Covidence, two independent investigators will conduct title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening to identify appropriate studies. Methodological quality of the trials will be assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool.

In this study, we present the overall picture of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Japan, focusing on why the country's countermeasures against COVID-19 have been delayed. As per our findings, it would be safe to say that the Japanese government has failed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic by failing to provide sufficient medical support. This is because of its refusal to change from the conservative policies it has implemented since the 1990s. Half-hearted countermeasures against infectious diseases and economic promotion measures that are inconsistent with the countermeasures against infectious diseases have not slowed down the spread of the pandemic. A change in direction from conservatism is essential not only for the containment of the coronavirus but also for the prospect of a long-term sustainable society.Alternate abstract:Este estudio tiene como objetivo explicar cómo ha afectado la pandemia de COVID-19 a Japón, enfocándonos especialmente en el sector económico del país.

Según nuestras conclusiones, se puede afirmar que el gobierno japonés ha fracasado en la contención de la pandemia de COVID-19 al no proporcionar suficiente apoyo médico. Esto se debe a su negativa a cambiar las políticas conservadoras que ha aplicado desde la década de 1990. Las medidas poco entusiastas contra las enfermedades infecciosas y las políticas de promoción económica que no son coherentes con las estrategias contra las enfermedades infecciosas no han frenado la propagación de la enfermedad.

Fetching new admissions to EI campuses during the pandemic has become a now or never situation for EIs. During crisis situations, institutions have struggled to return to the normal track. The pandemic has drastically changed students behavior and family preferences due to mental stress and the emotional life attached to it. Consequently, it becomes a prerequisite, and emergencies need to examine the choice characteristics influencing the selection of EI during the COVID19 pandemic situation. The purpose of this study is to critically examine institutional influence and pandemic influence due to COVID19 that affects students choice about an engineering institution (EI) and consequently to explore relationships between institutional and pandemic influence. The findings of this quantitative research, conducted through a self-reported survey, have revealed that institutional and pandemic influence have governed EI choice under the COVID19 pandemic. Second, pandemic influence is positively affected by institutional influence. The study demonstrated that EIs will have to reposition themselves to normalize pandemic influence by tuning institutional characteristics that regulate situational influence and new enrollments. It can be yardstick for policy makers to attract new enrollments under pandemic situations.","Mahajan, Prashant; Patil, Vaishali",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13297v1.pdf,478

In this report, we present the case of a 60-year-old female, who was a known case of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The patient presented to the emergency department on the 21st of October 2020, complaining of left breast pain for 10 days, which was associated with fever and nausea. On physical examination, the left breast was swollen and tender to palpation. There was a single patch of inflamed skin measuring 1 x 1 cm with greenish discoloration in the inframammary fold. Ultrasound of the breast showed a patch of focal mastitis with edema seen at 4-8 o'clock with no underlying fluid collection. She was admitted as a case of left breast abscess and was started on antibiotics.

In this paper, we study the impact of weekly testing protocols on college campuses. Methods: An extended susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) compartmental model was used to simulate COVID-19 spread on a college campus setting. Seven scenarios were evaluated which considered polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid antigen testing kits available at various levels of supply. The infection attack rate (IAR), the number of infections, and the number of tests utilized by the end of the simulation semester are reported and compared. Results: Weekly testing significantly reduces the number of infections compared to when testing is not available. The use of PCR tests results in the lowest infection attack rate and the total number of cases; however, using rapid antigen tests with higher coverage is more effective than using PCR tests with lower coverage. Conclusions: The implementation of COVID-19 testing protocols should be considered and evaluated as using testing allows for identification and isolation of cases which reduces the spread of COVID-19 on college campuses.

Next-generation sequencing is the state-of-the-art in open-view pathogen detection, and one of the few methods available at the earliest stages of an epidemic, even when the biological threat is unknown. Analyzing the samples as the sequencer is running can greatly reduce the turnaround time, but existing tools rely on close matches to lists of known pathogens and perform poorly on novel species. Machine learning approaches can predict if single reads originate from more distant, unknown pathogens, but require relatively long input sequences and processed data from a finished sequencing run. Incomplete sequences contain less information, leading to a trade-off between sequencing time and detection accuracy. Using a workflow for real-time pathogenic potential prediction, we investigate which subsequences already allow accurate inference. We train deep neural networks to classify Illumina and Nanopore reads and integrate the models with HiLive2, a real-time Illumina mapper. This approach outperforms alternatives based on machine learning and sequence alignment on simulated and real data, including SARS-CoV-2 sequencing runs. After just 50 Illumina cycles, we observe an 80-fold sensitivity increase compared to real-time mapping. The first 250bp of Nanopore reads, corresponding to 0.5s of sequencing time, are enough to yield predictions more accurate than mapping the finished long reads. The approach could also be used for screening synthetic sequences against biosecurity threats.","Bartoszewicz, Jakub M.; Genske, Ulrich; Renard, Bernhard Y.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.26.428301,478

The data showed that the avian infectious bronchitis virus (genus: γ-coronavirus) with an estimated D90 value of 17.8 J/m2 was highly UV sensitive, whereas Salivirus NG-J1 (genus: salivirus) with a D90 value of 346.4 J/m2 was highly UV resistant. Overall, the trend of UV-C sensitivity of (+) ssRNA virus families followed as Coronaviridae < Flaviviridae < Togadoviridae < Arteriviridae, Matonaviridae, Astroviridae < Caciviridae < Picornaviridae < Nodaviridae < Herpeviridae. The results revealed that the enveloped viral families (Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togadoviridae Arteriviridae, and Matonaviridae) are more UV-C sensitive than other nonenveloped families.

167423,Effect of Vitamin D Deficiency on COVID-19 Status: A Systematic Review,2021,"COVID-19 is a multi-system disease affecting many organs outside of the lungs, and patients generally develop varying degrees of neurological symptoms. Whereas, the pathogenesis underlying these neurological manifestations remains elusive. Although in vitro models and animal models are widely used in studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection, human organ models that can reflect the pathological alterations in a multi-organ context are still lacking. In this study, we propose a new strategy to probe the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on human brains in a linked alveolus-BBB organ chip platform. The new multi-organ platform allows to recapitulate the essential features of human alveolar-capillary barrier and blood-brain barrier in a microfluidic condition by co-culturing the organ-specific cells. The results reveal direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure has no obvious effects on BBB chip alone. While, infusion of endothelial medium from infected alveolus chips can cause BBB dysfunction and neuroinflammation on the linked chip platform, including brain endothelium disruption, glial cell activation and inflammatory cytokines release. These new findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could induce neuropathological alterations, which might not result from direct viral infection through hematogenous route, but rather likely from systemic inflammation following lung infection. This work provides a new strategy to study the virus-host interaction and neuropathology at an organ-organ context, which is not easily obtained by other in vitro models. This will facilitate to understand the neurological pathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2 and accelerate the development of new therapeutics. SUMMARY A linked human alveolus-BBB chip platform is established to explore the influences of SARS-CoV-2 on human brains in an organ-organ context. SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce BBB injury and neuroinflammation. The neuropathological changes are caused by SARS-CoV-2 indirectly, which might be mediated by systemic inflammation following lung infection, but probably not by direct viral neuroinvasion.","Wang, Peng; Jin, Lin; Zhang, Min; Wu, Yunsong; Duan, Zilei; Chen, Wenwen; Wang, Chaoming; Liao, Zhiyi; Han, Jianbao; Guo, Yingqi; Guo, Yaqiong; Wang, Yaqing; Lai, Ren; Qin, Jianhua",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.05.463205,478

168753,Plant Formulation ATRICOV 452 in Improving the Level of COVID-19 Specific Inflammatory Markers in Patients,2021-10-09,"This study explored the association of quality of life (QOL) during the pandemic with family climate and family integrity. Participants were 1085 parents from Turkey. According to the findings, the participants’ QOL, which demonstrated their judgments regarding their physical health, mental well-being, social relations, and general happiness, was greatly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Women were seen to have lower perceptions in relatedness in the family and cognitive cohesion than male participants. While there was a positive, but low, association between the variables, there were positive and high correlations between cognitive cohesion and relatedness in the family. When the mediation analyses were evaluated, it was concluded that QOL predicted the sense of family coherence alone, while intergenerational authority influenced other variables. The results highlighted the importance of family climate–based prevention and intervention targeting the promotion of family coherence.

169235,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Stroke Care at the University of Rochester Medical Center,2021,"COVID-19 has triggered an unprecedented global crisis, the increasing recessions in many countries and related trade uncertainties are affecting the whole wine sector, from production to distribution, sales, and consumption. While the full recovery is still uncertain, and even worse scenarios are possible if it takes longer to bring back trust and financial stability on wine markets, the crisis risks to jeopardies recent developments and sustainability in wine territories. Developing from a mixed-method participatory research process that integrates recent economic prospective with diverse experience data, we offer a critical reflection made by researchers and stakeholders supporting several socio-economic narratives and policy implications in the light of the current crisis. Distinguishing between short and long-term implications, we offer a reflection on the policy needs to alleviate the ongoing suffering of the sector. The speed and scope of the pandemic crisis underscore the need for the wine sector to become more resilient by increasing the ability to cooperate and coordinate among supply chain actors and between policy levels. The latter offers a reflection on the balance between short-term interventions and the complementarity of post-2020 CAP measures to stabilize market and future incomes. We conclude that once the crisis abates, it will be necessary to reaffirm credible commitment and trust at all levels, not only with regard to the vineyard and the cellars but also on distribution, especially in the face of a changing demand that in the future will become more pressing for issues related to safety and sustainability.","Vergamini, Daniele Bartolini Fabio Brunori Gianluca",Bio - Based and Applied Economics,https://doi.org/10.36253/bae-9017,478

170175,Regional Changes in Patterns of Stroke Presentation During the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"Vector Informatik offers technical training on different topics for engineers in the context of its Vector Academy. While some trainings were already implemented in a blended learning format, most were conducted as classroom trainings when the pandemic lockdown occurred. The Vector Academy rapidly created an offer for remote trainings tailored specifically to the further education of engineers, who were now restricted to their home office. Many existing studies on the nonmedical effects of the Covid-19 pandemic focus on schools or university students, but of course learning continues into the vocational regime of working adults where technical trainers like those of the Vector Academy provide job-relevant trainings for engineers. While some previous studies about trainers investigate the readiness of this very content-focussed teaching group to incorporate modern didactic concepts, now a radical switch to remote teaching formats was imposed. How did the trainers face that challenge? Guided (semi-structured) interviews with several technical trainers of both genders are analysed for common key concepts and summarized. We identify successful strategies and advantageous existing preconditions, as well as opposing factors hindering a swift methodical transition. These are translated into competencies and compared with a known competency model for technical trainers. We investigate whether competencies aiding a swift methodical transition are already included in a previously identified sub-set most relevant for this occupation and identify possible blind spots of either the model or the trainers. From the shared experience, recommendations are derived. Drastic changes like the pandemic lockdown of 2020 will be the focus of many studies in different fields, that might eventually condense into meta-studies and our common pool of knowledge. For those, studies like this one increase the range of teaching and learning subjects beyond the typical student age.

In response, the global scientific community has been committed to seeking to stop it. Classically, inactivation of viruses in the open space can be done by microwave thermal heating, strong chemical inactivation or UV irradiation, methods that affect the open public. New solutions have been researched, such as the use of the acoustic and / or electromagnetic field with certain frequencies, because the inactivation of the virus takes place at a reasonable power density, safe for the open public. The main target of this research was the S glycoprotein of SARS-Cov-2, because through its two subunits, S1 and S2, the virus recognizes and binds to the host cell. Based on the cryo-electron microscopy images at atomic level of the S glycoprotein, the 3D random surface calculation model was generated for the two functional states: pre-fusion and post-fusion. The S glycoprotein is analyzed as a microwave dielectric resonator and antenna;the resonance frequencies and radiation pattern have been computed in this paper. A number of 10 resonant frequencies in the millimeter range of the microwave and the radiation pattern of the first resonant frequency are presented. Because the viral action of SARS-CoV-2 is strongly dependent on the efficiency of the S glycoprotein, the change in its shape (through changes in the RNA of the cell) will be able to control the width of the radiation pattern (possible at its resonant eigenfrequency). © 2021 IEEE.","Gavriloaia, M.

Indeed the Kolkata index can be viewed as a generalized Hirsch index for a normalized inequality function and gives the fraction k of the total wealth possessed by the rich (1-k) fraction of the population. We analyze the structures of the inequality indices for both continuous and discrete income distributions. We also compare the Kolkata index to some other measures like the Gini coefficient and the Pietra index. Lastly, we provide some empirical studies which illustrate the differences between the Kolkata index and the Gini coefficient.","Banerjee, Suchismita; Chakrabarti, Bikas K.; Mitra, Manipushpak; Mutuswami, Suresh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08762v2.pdf,478

School closure and home confinement might have adverse effects on children's physical and mental health. In this study, we aimed to compare the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological reactions and coping of CF patients and healthy controls. Methods: 132 CF patients and 135 volunteers, ages 7 years and older, were included in the study. The survey included questions regarding family environment and peer relations, self care during lockdown and psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Compared to the patient group, the control group showed more anxiety symptoms, tried to have new hobbies during lockdown and needed more psychological help (Table 1). [Table presented] Conclusion: Surprisingly, symptoms of anxiety were higher in the control group compared to the CF group. CF patients seem to show more resiliance in coping with the outbreak and with school closure than their peers. Also, they reported needing less psychological help (not statistically significant). Since CF patients are already used to wearing face masks and follow infection control measures in their daily lives, these measures may not cause extra anxiety as in their healthy peers. Screening for psychological symptoms should be recommended both for CF patients and healthy children. Children with CF and also healthy children should be screened for anxiety symptoms and appropriate psychological support should be provided to them, if needed.","Ergenekon, A.

Objective: This research examines the combination of the Face Net algorithm with either k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) or multiclass support vector machine (SVM) to improve the accuracy. Methods: In this study, we used the UTA-RLDD dataset. The features used for fatigue detection come from the face, so the dataset is segmented using the Haar Cascades method, which is then resized. The feature extraction process uses FaceNet's pre-trained algorithm. The extracted features are classified into three classes—focused, unfocused, and fatigue—using the K-NN or multiclass SVM method. Results: The combination between the FaceNet algorithm and K-NN, with a value of resulted in a better accuracy than the FaceNet algorithm with multiclass SVM with the polynomial kernel (at 94.68% and 89.87% respectively).

However, the application of SfM-MVS in active underground mining has received less attention as there are unique challenges that need to be overcome, especially if a procedure is to be applied daily in active mining. Unique challenges include preparation time, camera positioning, illumination and useability. The faces of active development drives are generally only available for a short period before prepared and blasted, thus information is lost if not mapped immediately. Furthermore, due to safety concerns, unsupported faces cannot be approached for physical mapping. SfM-MVS allows these faces to be viewed and mapped in the form of a virtual outcrop, thus, allowing for remote mapping of underground development, which at the Dugald River mine, located in Queensland, Australia, allowed for mapping continuity as staff worked remotely during COVID-19. This contribution describes how to set-up a capture in an underground mine to produce high-quality SfM-MVS 3D reconstructions of development faces. The methodology can be readily incorporated into a standard operating procedure. While the procedure can be used with most photogrammetry software packages that utilise SfM-MVS algorithms, it is best utilised using the provided Python script and Agisoft Metashape Professional v1.6. The script allows for automation of capture processing, which can free up several hours per day compared to user-interacted processing.","Creus, P. K.; Sanislav, I. V.; Dirks, P. H. G.

This study evaluated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of patients, patient response time (pain-to-door), and intervention time (door-to-balloon) for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Methods: Patients with STEMI or NSTEMI visiting a hospital in South Korea who underwent primary coronary intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 29, 2020, to December 31, 2020) were compared with those in the equivalent period in 2018 to 2019. Patient response and intervention times were compared for the COVID-19 pandemic window (2020) and the equivalent period in 2018 to 2019. Results: We observed no decrease in the number of patients with STEMI (P=0.50) and NSTEMI (P=0.94) during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to that in the previous years. Patient response times (STEMI: P=0.34; NSTEMI: P=0.89) during the overall COVID-19 pandemic period did not differ significantly. However, we identified a significant decrease in time to intervention among patients with STEMI (14%; p<0.01) during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: We found that the number of patient with STEMI and NSTEMI was consistent during the COVID-19 pandemic and that no time delays in patient response and intervention occurred. However, the door-to-balloon time among patients with STEMI significantly reduced during the early COVID-19 pandemic, which could be attributed to reduced emergency care utilization during the early pandemic.","Ryu, S.; Kim, D.; Jung, L.

We employ a generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model and extend the analysis using the exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model to capture asymmetry and allegedly leverage. We proxy the news related to the negative effect of COVID-19 on the Australian health system and its economy as bad news, and on the other hand, measures taken by government economic stimulus packages through their monetary and fiscal policies as good news. The S&amp;P ASX200 (ASX-200) index is used as a proxy to the Australian stock market, and we use value-weighted returns of the stocks listed on ASX-200 for the period 27 January 2020 to 29 December 2020. The empirical results suggest the EGARCH model fits better in capturing asymmetry and leverage than the GARCH model in estimating the volatility of the Australian stock returns. However, another interesting finding is that the EGARCH model with volatility equation without news demonstrates a larger (smaller) leverage effect of the negative (positive) shocks on the conditional volatility compared to its variant with the news.","Iqbal, Najam Manzoor Muhammad Saqib Bhatti Muhammad Ishaq",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,https://doi.org/10.3390/jrfm14070314,478

One way to alleviate the problem might be to use prioritisation methods for patients on the waiting list and a wide range of research is available on such methods. However, significant variations and inconsistencies have been reported in prioritisation protocols from various specialties, institutions, and health systems. To bridge the evidence gap in existing literature, this comprehensive systematic review will synthesise global evidence on policy strategies with a unique insight to patient prioritisation methods to reduce waiting times for elective surgeries. This will provide evidence that might help with the tremendous burden of surgical disease that is now apparent in many countries because of operations that were delayed or cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and inform policy for sustainable healthcare management systems. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, with our most recent searches in January 2020. Articles published after 2013 on major elective surgery lists of adult patients were eligible, but cancer and cancer-related surgeries were excluded. Both randomised and non-randomised studies were eligible and the quality of studies was assessed with ROBINS-I and CASP tools. We registered the review in PROSPERO (CRD42019158455) and reported it in accordance with the PRISMA statement. Results: The electronic search in five bibliographic databases yielded 7543 records (PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Cochrane) and 17 eligible articles were identified in the screening. There were four quasi-experimental studies, 11 observational studies and two systematic reviews. These demonstrated a moderate to low risk of bias in their research methods. Three studies tested generic approaches using common prioritisation systems for all elective surgeries in common. The other studies assessed specific prioritisation approaches for re-ordering the waiting list for a particular surgical specialty. Conclusions: Explicit prioritisation tools with a standardised scoring system based on clear evidence-based criteria are likely to reduce waiting times and improve equitable access to health care. Multiple attributes need to be considered in defining a fair prioritisation system to overcome limitations with local variations and discriminations. Collating evidence from a diverse body of research provides a single framework to improve the quality and efficiency of elective surgical care provision in a variety of health settings. Universal prioritisation tools with vertical and horizontal equity would help with re-ordering patients on waiting lists for elective surgery and reduce waiting times.

Deep learning approaches are already widely used in the medical community. However, they require a large amount of data to be accurate. The open-source community collectively has made efforts to collect and annotate the data, but it is not enough to train an accurate deep learning model. Few-shot learning is a sub-field of machine learning that aims to learn the objective with less amount of data. In this work, we have experimented with well-known solutions for data scarcity in deep learning to detect COVID-19. These include data augmentation, transfer learning, and few-shot learning, and unsupervised learning. We have also proposed a custom few-shot learning approach to detect COVID-19 using siamese networks. Our experimental results showcased that we can implement an efficient and accurate deep learning model for COVID-19 detection by adopting the few-shot learning approaches even with less amount of data. Using our proposed approach we were able to achieve 96.4% accuracy an improvement from 83% using baseline models.","Jadon, Shruti",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06285v2.pdf,478
178404,Integrated miRNA/cytokine/chemokine profiling reveals immunopathological step changes associated with COVID-19 severity,2021-08-05,"A meaningful and deep understanding of the human aspects of software engineering (SE) requires psychological constructs to be considered. Psychology theory can facilitate the systematic and sound development as well as the adoption of instruments (e.g., psychological tests, questionnaires) to assess these constructs. In particular, to ensure high quality, the psychometric properties of instruments need evaluation. In this paper, we provide an introduction to psychometric theory for the evaluation of measurement instruments for SE researchers. We present guidelines that enable using existing instruments and developing new ones adequately. We conducted a comprehensive review of the psychology literature framed by the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing. We detail activities used when operationalizing new psychological constructs, such as item pooling, item review, pilot testing, item analysis, factor analysis, statistical property of items, reliability, validity, and fairness in testing and test bias. We provide an openly available example of a psychometric evaluation based on our guideline. We hope to encourage a culture change in SE research towards the adoption of established methods from psychology. To improve the quality of behavioral research in SE, studies focusing on introducing, validating, and then using psychometric instruments need to be more common.","Graziotin, Daniel; Lenberg, Per; Feldt, Robert; Wagner, Stefan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09959v4.pdf,478

It exploits echo-location information embedded within VoIP audio to support fine-grained location inference. We found consistent statistical features induced by the echo-reflection characteristics of the location into recorded speech. These features are discernible within traces received at the VoIP destination, enabling location inference. We evaluated VoIPLoc by developing a dataset of audio traces received through VoIP channels over the Tor network. We show that recording locations can be fingerprinted and detected remotely with a low false-positive rate, even when a majority of the audio samples are unlabelled. Finally, we note that the technique is fully passive and thus undetectable, unlike prior art. VoIPLoc is robust to the impact of environmental noise and background sounds, as well as the impact of compressive codecs and network jitter. The technique is also highly scalable and offers several degrees of freedom terms of the fingerprintable space.","Nagaraja, Shishir; Shah, Ryan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01904v2.pdf,478

To adapt to the current situation, as professionals, we have decided to transform the format into a virtual one that will offer the continuity of rehabilitation and therapy. Two clinical psychologists held online sessions and a special chat created in the IM messenger where patients could safely interact with each other.ObjectivesThis pilot study aimed to evaluate the effect of online sessions in a sample of outpatients engaged in rehabilitation programs.MethodsData from 50 patients (F20-F25, aged from 25 to 45) treated with a new online psychosocial program, including i. psychoeducation, ii. learning skills of the behavior under the circumstances of isolation, iii. training skills of effective communication and emotional regulation, and assessed for depression, anxiety, hopelessness, hostility (BDI, STAI, BHS, BDHI), and self-esteem, were analyzed for this study. Motivational enhancement techniques were also used to engage the patients in this new treatment format.ResultsAccording to the preliminary data, we point out a statistically meaningful reduction in depression (p=0,003), anxiety (p=0,001), and hostility (р=0,001);self-esteem, evaluated with the Dembo-Rubinstein method, was improved (p=0,002);the T Wilcoxon criterion used for rating the magnitude.ConclusionsOur results indicate that establishing a new online psychosocial program over the last few months positions us to respond effectively to such a new challenge and suggest that rehabilitative programs targeting patients’ needs may continue in this time of uncertainty.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Palin, A.; Shilko, N.; Pozharskaya, A.; Burygina, L.; Semenova, N.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.1800,478

To play such diverse roles, the N protein has two structured RNA-binding modules, the N- (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD) domains, which are connected by an intrinsically disordered region. Despite the wealth of structural data available for the isolated NTD and CTD, how these domains are arranged in the full-length protein and how the oligomerization of N influences its RNA-binding activity remains largely unclear. Herein, using experimental data from electron microscopy and biochemical/biophysical techniques combined with molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that, in the absence of RNA, the N protein forms structurally dynamic dimers with the NTD and CTD arranged in extended conformations. In the presence of RNA, however, the N protein assumes a more compact conformation where the NTD and CTD are packed together. We also provide an octameric model for the full-length N bound to RNA that is consistent with electron microscopy images of the N protein in the presence of RNA. Together, our results shed new light on the dynamics and higher-order oligomeric structure of this versatile protein.","Ribeiro Filho, Helder Veras; Jara, Gabriel Ernesto; Batista, Fernanda Aparecida Heleno; Schleder, Gabriel Ravanhani; Tonoli, Celisa Caldana; Soprano, Adriana Santos; Guimarães, Samuel Leite; Borges, Antonio Carlos; Cassago, Alexandre; Bajgelman, Marcio Chaim; Marques, Rafael Elias; Trivella, Daniela Barreto Barbosa; Franchini, Kleber Gomes; Figueira, Ana Carolina Migliorini; Benedetti, Celso Eduardo; Lopes de Oliveira, Paulo Sergio",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.27.457964,478

Typically, in the face of such a problem setting, we can model the network as a multi-attributed road-social network, in which each user is linked with location information and $d$ ($\geq\! 1$) numerical attributes. In practice, user preferences (i.e., weights) are usually inherently uncertain and can only be estimated with bounded accuracy, because a human user is not able to designate exact values with absolute precision. Inspired by this, we introduce a normative community model suitable for multi-criteria decision making, called multi-attributed community (MAC), based on the concepts of $k$-core and a novel dominance relationship specific to preferences. Given uncertain user preferences, namely, an approximate representation of weights, the MAC search reports the exact communities for each of the possible weight settings. We devise an elegant index structure to maintain the dominance relationships, based on which two algorithms are developed to efficiently compute the top-$j$ MACs. The efficiency and scalability of our algorithms and the effectiveness of MAC model are demonstrated by extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic road-social networks.","Guo, Fangda; Yuan, Ye; Wang, Guoren; Zhao, Xiangguo; Sun, Hao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09668v2.pdf,478

Retrospective assessment of the performance of three measures of comorbidity using 4,607 hospitalizations",2021-07-06,"Conotruncal malformations are a major cause of congenital heart defects in newborn infants. Recently, genetic screens in humans and mouse models have identified mutations in LRP2 as a novel cause of a common arterial trunk, a severe form of outflow tract (OFT) defect. Yet, the underlying mechanism why the morphogen receptor LRP2 is essential for OFT development remained unexplained. Studying LRP2-deficient mouse models, we now show that LRP2 is expressed in the cardiac progenitor niche of the anterior second heart field (SHF) that contributes to elongation of the OFT during separation into aorta and pulmonary trunk. Loss of LRP2 in mutant mice results in depletion of a pool of sonic hedgehog-dependent progenitor cells in the SHF due to premature differentiation into cardiomyocytes as they migrate into the OFT myocardium. Depletion of this cardiac progenitor cell pool results in aberrant shortening of the OFT, the cause of CAT formation in affected mice. Our findings identified the molecular mechanism whereby LRP2 controls maintenance of progenitor cell fate in the anterior SHF essential for OFT separation, and why receptor dysfunction is a novel cause of conotruncal malformation.","Christ, Annabel; Willnow, Thomas E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/801910,478

Methods and materials: We combined data from the Danish National Patient Register and in-hospital data on drug administrations and estimated glomerular filtration rates for admissions between 1 October 2009 and 1 June 2016, from a pool of about 2.9 million persons. We trained artificial neural network and linear logistic ridge regression models to predict the risk of five outcomes (>0, [≥]1, [≥]2, [≥]3 and [≥]5 inappropriate doses daily) with index set 24 hours after admission. We used time-series validation for evaluating discrimination, calibration, clinical utility and explanations. Results: Of 52,451 admissions included, 42,250 (81%) were used for model development. The median age was 77 years; 50% of admissions were of women. [≥]5 drugs were used between admission start and index in 23,124 admissions (44%); the most common drug classes were analgesics, systemic antibacterials, diuretics, antithrombotics, and antacids. The neural network models had better discriminative power (all AUROCs between 0.77 and 0.81) and were better calibrated than their linear counterparts. The main prediction drivers were use of anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and anti-Parkison's drugs as well as having a diagnosis of chronic kidney failure. Sex and age affected predictions but slightly. Conclusion: Our models can flag patients at high risk of receiving at least one inappropriate dose daily in a controlled in-silico setting. A prospective clinical study may confirm this holds in real-life settings and translates into benefits in hard endpoints.","Kaas-Hansen, B. S.; Rodriguez, C.

Anti-inflammatory therapy is used to achieve and maintain asthma control, as well as respiratory function indicators monitoring. Telemedicine technologies can be used for this purpose, and it became particularly essential during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective. The aim of the study is to analyze efficacy of the mobile technology MedQuizBot for asthma monitoring, to estimate patient compliance to use such instruments of self-control via the bot and without it, and bot's functioning satisfaction. Methods. 6-month prospective observational comparative study in patients with asthma from 4 to 17 years old was conducted. All patients were divided into two groups: patients who have used MedQuizBot and patients who have used any other self-control tools. Patients had to enter peakflowmetry data daily and undergo asthma control tests monthly. Patients were able to communicate with their doctor remotely via the chat bot. Main study indicators: determining the efficacy of MedQuizBot in patients with asthma by estimating the compliance to self-control tools at using the bot. Secondary study indicators: estimation of patients satisfaction on using the MedQuizBot and determination of level of asthma control due to the obtained data results. Results. 41 patients have used MedQuizBot, 27 patients were in the control group. Patients who used the bot more often answered asthma control test questions. Patients over 12 years old have completed the asthma control test less often than young children: ACT was filled on average in 1.5 times, САСТ — 1.8 times. 51% of patients filled in data on peakflowmetry via the new technology, patients from control group did not start the picflowmetry diary. Patients under 12 years old, who filled up the test with their parents, has entered picflowmetry data 7 times more often than adolescents. The asthma was under control in 70% of patients. The data was entered into the system 2.5 times more often during the lockdown period due to COVID-19 pandemic and during the tree flowering season in comparison to other periods of 2020. Patients noted the usability of the MedQuizBot and agreed to use it in future. Conclusion. MedQuizBot is effective in achieving asthma control mainly during the period of need — in case of insufficient control over the disease itself (exposure to pollen allergens, acute respiratory diseases), during the limitations in medical care availability.","Arimova, P.

The standard method of contagion detection is based on the evolution of the correlation matrix for the example of exchange rates or returns, usually after removing univariate dynamics with the GARCH model. It is a common observation that crises that have occurred in one financial market are usually transmitted to other financial markets/countries simultaneously and that they are visible in different financial variables such as returns and volatility which determine probability distribution. The changes in distributions can be detected through changes in the descriptive statistics of, e.g., returns characterised by expected value, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and other statistics. They determine the shape of the distribution function of returns. These descriptive statistics display dynamics over time. Moreover, they can interreact within the given financial or capital market and among markets.

Whether and to which degree pandemic-related therapy changes have occurred, has not been studied in detail. Objectives: To study the behaviour of patients with CIRD initially facing the COVID 19 pandemic related to their disease status and medication. Methods: Patients with CIRD were contacted by telephone to assess their health status and ask for changes in medication. Standardized assessment tools were used to assess disease activity, depression and anxiety. High disease activity was assumed if RADAI-5 ≥ 3.2 and BASDAI ≥ 4. Anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D) of patients were assessed using HADS. A score < 8 was taken as indication of no major problem in this regard. Results: A total of 886 patients was interviewed between April 15 and June 15 of 2020. Here we report on 550 patients with complete information on standard assessments (62%). About 60% were female, mean age 54.4±13.7, mean disease duration 12.2±10.5 years. Most had spondyloarthritis (SpA, n=287) including axial SpA (axSpA, n=172) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA, n=116), in total 52.2%, while 40.2% had rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n=221), and 7.6% connective tissue diseases (CTD, n=42). Most RA patients were on methotrexate (48.8%), while 43.8% took glucocorticoids. In addition, 61.0% of patients were on bDMARDs, mostly on TNF inhibitors (59.6%). More SpA than RA patients were on bDMARDs: 71.0% vs 49.7% respectively. A recent change in medication was reported by 182 patients (33.1%): 89 with RA (40.2%), 88 with SpA (30.6%) and 5 with CTD (11.9%).

A well-designed facility layout planning is essential for the smooth functioning as well as to provide safe and convenient services to patients at the right time. A functional layout is suggested to optimize time and resources in the process of service delivery, reducing the challenges of patients and healthcare professionals involved in patient care. This article focuses on developing a new facility functional layout that promotes convenience, comfort and economy with enhanced quality of medical care. A pathway of patient movement is effectively designed for better health outcomes, especially when there is a huge inflow of patients seeking information about the choice of healthcare facilities and subsequent medical attention. A circular hospital facility layout with unidirectional flow is proposed, which will effectively prevent face-to-face movement of incoming and outgoing patients and their bystanders, thereby preventing spread of diseases or infection and speed up the service delivery process. The authors believe that the proposed layout will substantially improve quality, service and speed of medical procedures, though the initial investment might be higher for implementing this layout.

Controlling for other relevant determinants of NPLs, our regression analyses show that economies in which policymakers have used prudential and borrower support measures reported significantly slower growth of aggregate NPLs. The prudential measures also confirmed a more robust relationship with NPL reductions compared with borrower support measures. Added to this, non-mortgage consumer loans are found to be more sensitive than mortgage loans to economic policy responses.","Gholipour, Hassan F.; Arjomandi, Amir",International Review of Finance,https://doi.org/10.1111/irfi.12362,478

For this reason, the importance of a good measurement on the counting of observed cases has a crucial role. This work addresses the time-lagged effect problem via Bayesian analysis supported by a stochastic discrete-event simulation to give an answer to the truthfulness of the data and to validate the obtained results in terms of proportions based on an expected result in the particular case of Spain. Obtained results show that the reported data is untruthful and can make wrong any analysis, but even when the simulating results are as we expected they might be wrong in terms of absolute numbers.

Here we report the first experiences from a first-line referral centre from Amager-Hvidovre Hospital, situated on the outskirts of Copenhagen. METHODS A retrospective quality assessment was performed with collection of symptom patterns and COVID-19 status. RESULTS During the first 24 days, a total of 3,551 patients were referred for assessment of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection and COVID-19. A total of 2,048 patients were assessed as having mild symptoms and referred for COVID-19 testing alone, whereas 337 patients were assessed clinically by a physician. Thirty-seven were positive for COVID-19 infection, 286 were negative. The most common symptoms reported were fever, coughing and dyspnoea. Fever was an independent predictor of COVID-19 infection (odds ratio (OR) = 2.25 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-5.04); p = 0.037); whereas sore throat was not (OR = 0.40 (95% CI: 0.15-0.92); p = 0.045). Only a small number of patients reported loss of taste or anosmia. In total, 113 patients were admitted to hospital, the majority of patients were discharged within 24 hours with mild symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections. Three of the COVID-19-positive patients developed a severe infection and two had a fatal outcome.

187623,Sterile Parts of Operating Gown during Lower Limb Joint Replacement Surgery.,2019,"For paramyxoviruses, two viral glycoproteins are key to the entry process: an attachment protein (HN, H, or G) and the fusion protein (F). The F protein folds to a metastable state that can be triggered to undergo large conformational rearrangements to a fusogenic intermediate and a more stable postfusion state. The triggering mechanism that controls paramyxovirus fusion has not been elucidated. To correlate the molecular structure of a soluble form of the prefusion F (PIV5 F-GCNt) with the biological function of F, soluble F protein was triggered to refold. In the absence of HN, heat was found to function as a surrogate F trigger, and F associated with liposomes and aggregated on sucrose density gradients. Electron microscopy data showed that triggered F formed rosettes. Taken together these data suggest that release and membrane insertion of the hydrophobic fusion peptide require both cleavage of F and heat. Heating of cleaved F causes conversion to a postfusion form as judged by its ""golf tee"" morphology in the electron microscope. Heating of uncleaved F also causes conversion of F to a morphologically similar form. The reactivity of the F protein with conformation-specific mAbs and peptide binding suggest that soluble F-GCNt and membrane-bound F proteins refold through a comparable pathway.","Connolly, Sarah A; Leser, George P; Yin, Hsien-Shen; Jardetzky, Theodore S; Lamb, Robert A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17093041/,478

The implicated bacteria (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, and Tannerella forsythensis) are located in stagnant areas in the oral cavity, such as the dorsal surface of tongue, periodontal pockets, and interproximal areas. These bacteria proteolyse the amino acids releasing volatile sulphur compounds. The management of halitosis involves determining and eliminating the causes, which includes identifying any contributory factors, because certain medical conditions are also associated with characteristic smells. Professional advice should be given on oral hygiene and diet, and treatments should include dental scaling, and root planing of the associated periodontal pockets to reduce the bacterial loading. In addition to the normal oral hygiene practice, tongue cleaning and use of mouthwash are advocated.

HRV species C, described in 2006, can only be detected using molecular methods. The objectives of this paper were to adapt a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for HRV detection and to further determine the frequency of HRV in respiratory samples from children under 2 years of age, with acute respiratory infection (ARI), from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Two real-time RT-PCR assays amplifying the 207 base pair of the 5' non-coding region were compared. The original protocol includes locked nucleic acid analogues and a pyrimidine derivative in the forward primer, while the adapted protocol avoided those molecules. Of 67 respiratory samples, 17 (25.4 %) were positive with the original protocol, and 20 (29.9 %) with the adapted one. Discrepant results were confirmed by sequencing analysis. An expanded gold standard was defined to determine the performance of both assays, and was used to describe the clinical characteristics of positive patients. Better sensitivity and specificity were obtained with the adapted protocol. Considering the expanded gold standard, HRV were detected in 23/67 (34.3 %) patients with ARI: 8/18 (44.4 %) outpatients and 15/49 (30.6 %) hospitalized. Wheezing episodes were more frequent in HRV positive patients (43.5 %) than in HRV negative patients (18.2 %) (p = 0.041).

191323,Cardiovascular risk and complications associated with COVID-19.,2020,"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common nosocomial infection in the intensive care unit and is associated with major morbidity and attributable mortality. Strategies to prevent VAP are likely to be successful only if based upon a sound understanding of pathogenesis and epidemiology. The major route for acquiring endemic VAP is oropharyngeal colonization by the endogenous flora or by pathogens acquired exogenously from the intensive care unit environment, especially the hands or apparel of health-care workers, contaminated respiratory equipment, hospital water, or air. The stomach represents a potential site of secondary colonization and reservoir of nosocomial Gram-negative bacilli. Endotracheal-tube biofilm formation may play a contributory role in sustaining tracheal colonization and also have an important role in late-onset VAP caused by resistant organisms. Aspiration of microbe-laden oropharyngeal, gastric, or tracheal secretions around the cuffed endotracheal tube into the normally sterile lower respiratory tract results in most cases of endemic VAP. In contrast, epidemic VAP is most often caused by contamination of respiratory therapy equipment, bronchoscopes, medical aerosols, water (eg, Legionella) or air (eg, Aspergillus or the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus). Strategies to eradicate oropharyngeal and/or intestinal microbial colonization, such as with chlorhexidine oral care, prophylactic aerosolization of antimicrobials, selective aerodigestive mucosal antimicrobial decontamination, or the use of sucralfate rather than H(2) antagonists for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and measures to prevent aspiration, such as semirecumbent positioning or continuous subglottic suctioning, have all been shown to reduce the risk of VAP. Measures to prevent epidemic VAP include rigorous disinfection of respiratory equipment and bronchoscopes, and infection-control measures to prevent contamination of medical aerosols. Hospital water should be Legionella-free, and high-risk patients, especially those with prolonged granulocytopenia or organ transplants, should be cared for in hospital units with high-efficiency-particulate-arrestor (HEPA) filtered air. Routine surveillance of VAP, to track endemic VAPs and facilitate early detection of outbreaks, is mandatory.","Safdar, Nasia; Crnich, Christopher J; Maki, Dennis G",Respiratory care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15913465/,478

Published data on changes in medication use after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, a type of bariatric surgery that is growing in popularity, are limited. OBJECTIVE To determine whether patients took fewer medications for management of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, relative to preprocedure medications. METHODS In this prospective, single-centre cohort study, a nurse practitioner used standard medication reconciliation and study data-extraction forms to interview adult patients who had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and determine their medication use and pertinent demographic data. The data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations and standard statistical software. Outcome measures included changes in the use of antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and antilipemic medications at 1, 3, and 6 months after the surgery. RESULTS A total of 65 patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy between May 2011 and January 2014 met the study inclusion criteria. Before surgery, the 30 patients with type 2 diabetes were taking an average of 1.9 antidiabetic medications. One month after the procedure, 15 (50%) had discontinued all antidiabetic medications, with a further decline at 3 and 6 months (p < 0.001 at each time point). Among the patients who were taking antihypertensives (n = 48) and antilipemics (n = 33) before surgery, the decline in use occurred at a more modest rate, with 6 (12%) and 2 (6%), respectively, discontinuing these medication classes within 1 month, and 12 (25%) (p = 0.001) and 8 (24%) (p = 0.015) having discontinued by 6 months. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that patients with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and/or dyslipidemia who undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy are less likely to require disease-specific medications shortly after surgery.","Dillon, Carla; Peddle, Justin; Twells, Laurie; Lester, Kendra; Midodzi, William; Manning, Kimberley; Murphy, Raleen; Pace, David; Smith, Chris; Boone, Darrell; Gregory, Deborah",The Canadian journal of hospital pharmacy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25964682/,478

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Methods This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on suspected COVID-19 patients, who presented to Behpooyan Clinic Medical center in Tehran (Iran) from 22 February to 14 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases. Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum. In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others. ALT (AUC = 0.879), CRP (AUC = 0.870), NEU (AUC = 0.858), LDH (AUC = 0.835), and Urea (AUC = 0.835) had very good accuracy in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19, respectively.

All animal RNA viruses have Asn at the structurally homologous position of their polymerases, suggesting a conserved function for this residue. However, all prokaryotic RNA viruses have Glu at this position. In the presence of Mg2+, the apparent affinity of Glu-297 3Dpol for 2'-deoxyribonucleotides was decreased by 6-fold relative to wild type without a substantial difference in the fidelity of 2'-dNMP incorporation. The fidelity of ribonucleotide misincorporation for Glu-297 3Dpol was reduced by 14-fold relative to wild type. A 4- to 11-fold reduction in the rate of ribonucleotide incorporation was observed. Glu-297 PV was unable to grow in HeLa cells due to a replication defect equivalent to that observed for a mutant PV encoding an inactive polymerase. Evaluation of the protein-(VPg)-primed initiation reaction showed that only half of the Glu-297 3Dpol initiation complexes were capable of producing VPg-pUpU product and that the overall yield of uridylylated VPg products was reduced by 20-fold relative to wild-type enzyme, a circumstance attributable to a reduced affinity for UTP. These studies identify the first RdRp derivative with a mutator phenotype and provide a mechanistic basis for the elevated mutation frequency of RNA phage relative to animal RNA viruses observed in culture. Although protein-primed initiation and RNA-primed elongation complexes employ the same polymerase active site, the functional differences reported here imply significant structural differences between these complexes.","Korneeva, Victoria S; Cameron, Craig E",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17400557/,478
195274,[Diagnostic imaging findings in COVID-19].,2020-04-06,"The Vaccine Research Center has developed a number of vaccine candidates for different diseases/infectious agents (HIV-1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus, West Nile virus, and Ebola virus, plus a plasmid cytokine adjuvant-IL-2/Ig) based on a DNA plasmid vaccine platform. To support the clinical development of each of these vaccine candidates, preclinical studies were performed to screen for potential toxicities (intrinsic and immunotoxicities). All treatment-related toxicities identified in these repeated-dose toxicology studies have been confined primarily to the sites of injection and seem to be the result of both the delivery method (as they are seen in both control and treated animals) and the intended immune response to the vaccine (as they occur with greater frequency and severity in treated animals). Reactogenicity at the site of injection is generally seen to be reversible as the frequency and severity diminished between doses and between the immediate and recovery termination time points. This observation also correlated with the biodistribution data reported in the companion article (Sheets et al., 2006), in which DNA plasmid vaccine was shown to remain at the site of injection, rather than biodistributing widely, and to clear over time. The results of these safety studies have been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration to support the safety of initiating clinical studies with these and related DNA plasmid vaccines. Thus far, standard repeated-dose toxicology studies have not identified any target organs for toxicity (other than the injection site) for our DNA plasmid vaccines at doses up to 8 mg per immunization, regardless of disease indication (i.e., expressed gene-insert) and despite differences (strengths) in the promoters used to drive this expression. As clinical data accumulate with these products, it will be possible to retrospectively compare the safety profiles of the products in the clinic to the results of the repeated-dose toxicology studies, in order to determine the utility of such toxicology studies for signaling potential immunotoxicities or intrinsic toxicities from DNA vaccines. These data build on the biodistribution studies performed (see companion article, Sheets et al., 2006) to demonstrate the safety and suitability for investigational human use of DNA plasmid vaccine candidates for a variety of infectious disease prevention indications.","Sheets, Rebecca L; Stein, Judith; Manetz, T Scott; Andrews, Charla; Bailer, Robert; Rathmann, John; Gomez, Phillip L",Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16569728/,478

Response measures employed to control it have generally been effective but are unlikely to be sustainable over the long term. METHODS We examined the evidence for a vaccine-driven COVID-19 exit strategy including academic papers, governmental reports and epidemiological data, and discuss the shift from the current pandemic footing to an endemic approach similar to influenza and other respiratory infectious diseases. RESULTS A desired endemic state is characterised by a baseline prevalence of infections with a generally mild disease profile that can be sustainably managed by the healthcare system, together with the resumption of near normalcy in human activities. Such an endemic state is attainable for COVID-19 given the promising data around vaccine efficacy, although uncertainty remains around vaccine immunity escape in emergent variants of concern. Maintenance of non-pharmaceutical interventions remains crucial until high vaccination coverage is attained to avoid runaway outbreaks. It may also be worthwhile to de-escalate measures in phases, before standing down most measures for an endemic state. If a variant that substantially evades immunity emerges, it will need to be managed akin to a new disease threat, with pandemic preparedness and response plans. CONCLUSION An endemic state for COVID-19, characterised by sustainable disease control measures, is likely attainable through vaccination.","Wei, Wycliffe Enli; Tan, Wei Keat; Cook, Alex Richard; Hsu, Li Yang; Teo, Yik Ying; Lee, Vernon Jian Ming","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34472557/,478
199086,Neurological features and outcome in COVID-19: dementia can predict severe disease,2021,"Context SARS-CoV-2 is a global public-health concern. Interventions to prevent infection are urgently needed. The anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects of neem make it a potential agent for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Objective The study intended to evaluate the prophylactic effects of neem capsules for persons at high risk of COVID-19 infection due to contact with COVID-19 positive patients. Design The research team designed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study. Setting The study was conducted at a single center in India. Participants Participants were 190 healthcare workers at the hospital or relatives of patients with COVID-19 infection. Intervention Of the 190 participants, 95 were in the intervention group and 95 in the control group. Participants received 50 mg of a proprietary, patent-pending, neem-leaf extract or a placebo orally in capsules, twice a day for 28 days. Outcome Measures The number of individuals positive for COVID-19 between baseline and follow-up on day 56 was the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures included an evaluation of neem's safety and its effects on quality of life (QOL) and changes in biomarkers. Results The mean age of participants was 36.97 years, and 68.42% were male. Total 13 subjects tested positive during the study. All were asymptomatic. Of the 154 participants who completed the study per-protocol, 11 tested positive, 3 in the intervention group and 8 in the control group. The probability of COVID-19 infection in participants receiving the intervention was 0.45 times that of participants receiving the placebo, a relative risk of 0.45, with the effectiveness of the intervention being around 55%. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in both groups were minimal and were of grade 1 or 2 in severity. Biomarkers and QOL remained stable in both groups. Conclusions The study found a reduced risk of COVID-19 infection in participants receiving neem capsules, which demonstrates its potential as a prophylactic treatment for the prevention of COVID-19 infection. The findings warrant further investigation in clinical trials.","Nesari, Tanuja Manoj; Bhardwaj, Anju; ShriKrishna, Rajagopala; Ruknuddin, Galib; Ghildiyal, Shivani; Das, Asim; Pandey, Anil Kumar; Chaudhary, Nidhi; Soman, Girish; Barde, Mohini",Alternative therapies in health and medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33891569/,478

The effect on pregnancy was to cause embryonic death and resorption, leaving a deciduoma with trophoblastic giant cells as the only embryonic remnants. Up to 30% of fetuses in each pregnant animal were affected at the time of severe maternal lung lesions. Heavy growths of Pasteurella pneumotropica were obtained from the lungs of all affected dams. The formation of deciduomas as a result of embryonic death was due to the indirect effect of damage to the lungs during pregnancy rather than the direct pathogenic effect on the developing embryo of the microbial organisms isolated.","Carthew, P; Aldred, P",Laboratory animals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2832656/,478
199575,Being a Myeloproliferative Patient in COVID-19 Era: The Mytico Study,2021,"We present an analysis of the first 10 weeks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong. The epidemic to date has been characterized by two large clusters-initiated by two separate ""super-spread"" events (SSEs)-and by ongoing community transmission. By fitting a stochastic model to data on 1512 cases, including these clusters, we show that the etiological agent of SARS is moderately transmissible. Excluding SSEs, we estimate that 2.7 secondary infections were generated per case on average at the start of the epidemic, with a substantial contribution from hospital transmission. Transmission rates fell during the epidemic, primarily as a result of reductions in population contact rates and improved hospital infection control, but also because of more rapid hospital attendance by symptomatic individuals. As a result, the epidemic is now in decline, although continued vigilance is necessary for this to be maintained. Restrictions on longer range population movement are shown to be a potentially useful additional control measure in some contexts. We estimate that most currently infected persons are now hospitalized, which highlights the importance of control of nosocomial transmission.","Riley, Steven; Fraser, Christophe; Donnelly, Christl A; Ghani, Azra C; Abu-Raddad, Laith J; Hedley, Anthony J; Leung, Gabriel M; Ho, Lai-Ming; Lam, Tai-Hing; Thach, Thuan Q; Chau, Patsy; Chan, King-Pan; Lo, Su-Vui; Leung, Pak-Yin; Tsang, Thomas; Ho, William; Lee, Koon-Hung; Lau, Edith M C; Ferguson, Neil M; Anderson, Roy M",Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12766206/,478
199619,Neurological complications of COVID-19: a preliminary review,2020,"OBJECTIVE To describe the epidemiologic, clinical, neuroimaging, and laboratory features; treatment; and outcome in a cohort of children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). METHODS A 6-year retrospective chart review of children with the diagnosis of ADEM was conducted. RESULTS Eighteen cases were identified. Sixteen patients (88%) presented in either winter or spring. Thirteen children (72%) had a recent upper respiratory tract illness. Patients presented most often with motor deficits (77%) and secondly with altered consciousness (45%). Spinal fluid abnormalities occurred in 70%. Despite rigorous microbiologic testing, a definite microbiologic diagnosis was established only in 1 child with Epstein-Barr virus disease and probable or possible diagnoses in 3 children with Bartonella henselae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or rotavirus disease. Brain magnetic resonance imaging identified lesions in the cerebral cortex in 80%, in subcortical white matter in 93%, in periventricular white matter in 60%, in deep gray matter in 47%, and in brainstem in 47% of patients. Eleven patients (61%) were treated with corticosteroids, and 2 were treated with intravenous immunoglobulins. All patients survived. Three patients (17%) had long-term neurologic sequelae. CONCLUSIONS Epidemiologic evidence from this study suggests an infectious cause for ADEM. The agent is most likely a difficult-to-diagnose winter/spring respiratory virus. Magnetic resonance imaging was the neuroimaging study of choice for establishing the diagnosis and for following the course of the disease. Prognosis for survival and outcome was excellent. Recurrent episodes of ADEM must be differentiated from multiple sclerosis.","Murthy, S N Krishna; Faden, Howard S; Cohen, Michael E; Bakshi, Rohit",Pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12165620/,478
199745,Five common skin manifestations of COVID-19 identified,2020,"AIM The aim of our study was to improve poor results of preliminary colporrhaphy and anterior levatoroplasty performed for patients with low and middle rectocele. MATIRIAL OF STUDY 55 patients who had undergone colporrhaphy and anterior levatoroplasty for rectocele in 2012- 2015 and contacted the clinic with complaints of ongoing obstructive defecation were included in this investigation. They had a comprehensive medical examination using defecography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, anorectal functional tests. This study revealed perineum descending in 20 patients, apical prolapse 23 patients, and 12 patients demonstrated simultaneous pathology. All these patients were performed additional abdominal sacrocolporectopexy in 2015-2017 and results were estimated. RESULTS Abdominal sacrocolporectopexy significantly improved anatomical and functional results of previous surgery which was confirmed by the listed methods of research. The average location of the anorectal area and utero-cervical zone became higher. So, perineum descendents and apical prolapsed were improved. DISCUSSION Sacrocolporectopexy is often used for surgical treatment of pelvic organ prolapse. Our study shows its efficiency in patients with perineum descending and upper rectocele. CONCLUSIONS Abdominal sacrocolporectopexy is an effective method of surgical correction of relapses and unsatisfactory results of treatment of patients with pelvic prolapse, manifested by perineum body descending and apical prolapse.

200069,An Evaluation of Mathematical Models for the Outbreak of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND Trauma remains a leading cause of death worldwide. The development of trauma systems in low-resource settings may be of benefit. The objective of this study was to describe operative procedures performed for trauma at a tertiary care facility in Kigali, Rwanda, and to evaluate geographical variations and referral patterns of trauma care. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all prospectively collected operative cases performed at the largest referral hospital in Rwanda, the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali (CHUK), between June 1 and Dec. 1, 2011, for injury-related diagnoses. We used the Pearson χ² and Fisher exact tests to compare cases arising from within Kigali to those transferred from other provinces. Geospatial analyses were also performed to further elucidate transfer patterns. RESULTS Over the 6-month study period, 2758 surgical interventions were performed at the CHUK. Of these, 653 (23.7%) were for trauma. Most patients resided outside of Kigali city, with 337 (58.0%) patients transferred from other provinces and 244 (42.0%) from within Kigali. Most trauma procedures were orthopedic (489 [84.2%]), although general surgery procedures represented a higher proportion of trauma surgeries in patients from other provinces than in patients from within Kigali (28 of 337 [8.3%] v. 10 of 244 [4.1%]). CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this is the first study to highlight geographical variations in access to trauma care in a low-income country and the first description of trauma procedures at a referral centre in Rwanda. Future efforts should focus on maturing prehospital and interfacility transport systems, strengthening district hospitals and further supporting referral institutions.","Ntakiyiruta, Georges; Wong, Evan G; Rousseau, Mathieu C; Ruhungande, Landouald; Kushner, Adam L; Liberman, Alexander S; Khwaja, Kosar; Dakermandji, Marc; Wilson, Marnie; Razek, Tarek; Kyamanywa, Patrick; Deckelbaum, Dan L",Canadian journal of surgery.

200632,COVID-19: A Potential Trigger for Thyroid Dysfunction,2021,"Emerging infectious diseases of wildlife are of increasing concern to managers and conservation policy makers, but are often difficult to study and predict due to the complexity of host-disease systems and a paucity of empirical data. We demonstrate the use of an Approximate Bayesian Computation statistical framework to reconstruct the disease dynamics of bovine tuberculosis in Kruger National Park's lion population, despite limited empirical data on the disease's effects in lions. The modeling results suggest that, while a large proportion of the lion population will become infected with bovine tuberculosis, lions are a spillover host and long disease latency is common. In the absence of future aggravating factors, bovine tuberculosis is projected to cause a lion population decline of ~3% over the next 50 years, with the population stabilizing at this new equilibrium. The Approximate Bayesian Computation framework is a new tool for wildlife managers. It allows emerging infectious diseases to be modeled in complex systems by incorporating disparate knowledge about host demographics, behavior, and heterogeneous disease transmission, while allowing inference of unknown system parameters.","Kosmala, Margaret; Miller, Philip; Ferreira, Sam; Funston, Paul; Keet, Dewald; Packer, Craig",Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27039526/,478

200659,Challenges and Consequences of COVID-19 in the Management of Anorectal Cancer: Coming Together Through Social Distancing,2020,"This review summarizes the combined insights from recent structural and functional studies of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) with the primary focus on the mechanisms of initiation of RNA synthesis. Replication of RNA viruses has traditionally been approached using a combination of biochemical and genetic methods. Recently, high-resolution structures of six viral RdRPs have been determined. For three RdRPs, enzyme complexes with metal ions, single-stranded RNA and/or nucleoside triphosphates have also been solved. These advances have expanded our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of viral RNA synthesis and facilitated further RdRP studies by informed site-directed mutagenesis. What transpires is that the basic polymerase right hand shape provides the correct geometrical arrangement of substrate molecules and metal ions at the active site for the nucleotidyl transfer catalysis, while distinct structural elements have evolved in the different systems to ensure efficient initiation of RNA synthesis. These elements feed the template, NTPs and ions into the catalytic cavity, correctly position the template 3' terminus, transfer the products out of the catalytic site and orchestrate the transition from initiation to elongation.","van Dijk, Alberdina A; Makeyev, Eugene V; Bamford, Dennis H",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15105525/,478

200893,Periorbital erythema is a common cutaneous manifestation in COVID-19,2021,"Protective properties of three distinct infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) Ark Delmarva poultry industry (ArkDPI) S1 proteins encoded from replication-defective recombinant adenovirus vectors were investigated. Using a suboptimal dose of each recombinant virus, we demonstrated that IBV S1 amino acid sequences showing > or = 95.8% amino acid identity to the S1 of the challenge strain differed in their ability at conferring protection. Indeed, the S1 sequence of the IBV population previously designated C4 (AdIBVS1.C4), which protected the most poorly, differs from the S1 sequence of population C2 (AdIBVS1.C2), which provided the highest protection, only at amino acid position 56. The fact that a change in one amino acid in this region significantly altered the induction of a protective immune response against this protein provides evidence that the first portion of S1 displays relevant immunoprotective epitopes. Use of an optimal dose of AdIBVS1.C2 effectively protected chickens from clinical signs and significantly reduced viral load after IBV Ark virulent challenge. Moreover, increased numbers of both IgA and IgG IBV-specific antibody secreting lymphocytes were detected in the spleen after challenge. The increased response detected for both IgA and IgG lymphocytes after challenge might be explained by vaccine-induced B memory cells. The fact that a single vaccination with Ad/IBVS1.C2 provides protection against IBV challenge is promising, because Ad-vectored vaccines can be mass delivered by in ovo inoculation using automated in ovo injectors.","Toro, H; Zhang, J F; Gallardo, R A; van Santen, V L; van Ginkel, F W; Joiner, K S; Breedlove, C",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055623/,478

The etiologic agent of this disease was found to be a previously unknown coronavirus, SARS-CoV. The detailed pathology of SARS-CoV infection and the host response to the viral infection are still not known. The 3a gene encodes a non-structural viral protein which is predicted to be a transmembrane protein. In this study, we showed that the 3a protein was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in 3a-transfected monkey kidney Vero E6 cells. In vitro experiments of chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation suggest that the 3a protein may trigger apoptosis. Our data show that over-expression of a single SARS-CoV protein can induce apoptosis in vitro. Thus GFP-3a fusion protein could also be used as a biosensor for monitoring the cytopathic features of SARS infection, e.g. lymphopenia, in animal model systems, similar to nucleocapsid and 7a proteins.","Y Waye, Mary; W Law, Patrick; Wong, Chi-Hang; C Au, Thomas; Chuck, Chi-Pang; Kong, Siu-Kai; S Chan, Paul; To, Ka-Fai; I Lo, Anthony; W Chan, Judy; Suen, Yick-Keung; Edwin Chan, H Y; Fung, Kwok-Pui; Y Sung, Joseph; Lo, Y M; W Tsui, Stephen",Conference proceedings : ...

We identified published articles on SARS-COV efficacy experiments in which some selected compounds were used to test the reduction of the virus load in mice. METHODS A systematic search of articles was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. We then developed a combined model based on a systematic review, meta-analyses, and molecular docking studies to evaluate the effect size of preclinical studies of compounds that have been tested against SARS-COV. Because substantial heterogeneity was expected, random effect model meta-analyses were carried out to estimate the overall pooled disease's prevalence. All meta-analyses were performed with Stata version 15.0. Subgroup analyses on therapies were conducted as well. Molecular docking studies of the inhibitors in the active pocket of COVID-19 protease were also performed. RESULTS From all screened articles, six studies were appropriate for ultimate meta-analysis and systematic review. The residual amount of heterogeneity was high (τ2 =0.02; heterogeneity I2 =85.5 % with heterogeneity chi-square =103.57, a degree of freedom =15, and p <0.001). The overall random pooled prevalence of infected mice treated with the selected compounds was 78.1 % [95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 14.7-17.0 %]. Prophylactic has a significantly higher pooled prevalence than therapeutic, with 21.8 % (95 % CI: 16.4 % to 28.8 %). Our results indicated that most of the SARS-COV inhibitors analyzed were less effective in reducing the lung virus titer of SARS-COV infection in animal models. The findings from molecular docking studies also identified COVID-19 inhibitors that are good for optimization and drug development to fight against COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS Findings from the review showed that studies on the preclinical compounds targeting SARS-COV and COVID-19 are limited. Furthermore, molecular docking studies and meta-analysis results substantiated three compounds, i.e., EIDD-2801, GS-5734, and amodiaquine.

Worldwide reports describe significant declines in pediatric emergency department (PED) visits during COVID-19. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 on all PED presentations, including asthma, at an early epicenter has not been studied beyond the pandemic peak and into the early phases of state re-opening. OBJECTIVES: To compare PED health-seeking behaviors and clinical characteristics during the 2020 pandemic and subsequent initial New York State (NYS) phased re-opening to the same period in 2019. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of children &lt;21 years utilizing the PED at a high-volume quaternary children's hospital in The Bronx, NY from March 15th 2020 - July 6th 2020 (pandemic cohort) and the same interval in 2019 (comparison cohort). Visits were assigned to pre-determined diagnostic categories. Demographic and clinical data were compared. RESULTS: 19,981 visits were included. Visits declined by 66% during 2020. Proportions of asthma visits (2% vs. 7%, p &lt; 0.0001) and minor medical problems (61% vs. 67%, p &lt; 0.0001) had significant declines in the pandemic cohort, while major medical problems (13% vs. 8%, p &lt; 0.0001), appendicitis (1% vs. 0.4%, p &lt; 0.0001) and other surgical complaints (1% vs. 0.5%, p &lt; 0.0001) had proportional increases in the pandemic cohort. No significant proportional changes were noted among psychosocial and trauma groups between the two cohorts. CONCLUSION: The pandemic cohort experienced a substantial decrease in PED volume, but an increase in acuity and admission rates, which was sustained through the NYS phase-II re-opening. Despite being located in an asthma hub, the incidence of asthma-related PED visits declined appreciably in the pandemic cohort. Future studies examining the effects of indoor allergens in isolation on pediatric asthma are warranted.","Levene, R.; Fein, D. M.; Silver, E. J.; Joels, J.

205623,In the eye of the storm: the right ventricle in COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate prevalence and epidemiological and clinical factors associated with olfactory dysfunction (OD) and gustatory dysfunction (GD) in COVID-19 patients according to the disease severity. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 2579 patients with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified between March 22 and June 3, 2020 from 18 European hospitals. Epidemiological and clinical data were extracted. Otolaryngological symptoms, including OD and GD, were collected through patient-reported outcome questionnaire and Sniffin'Sticks tests were carried out in a subset of patients. RESULTS: A total of 2579 patients were included, including 2166 mild (84.0%), 144 moderate (5.6%) and 269 severe-to-critical (10.4%) patients. Mild patients presented an otolaryngological picture of the disease with OD, GD, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea and sore throat as the most prevalent symptoms. The prevalence of subjective OD and GD was 73.7 and 46.8%, and decreases with the severity of the disease. Females had higher prevalence of subjective OD and GD compared with males. Diabetes was associated with a higher risk to develop GD. Among the subset of patients who benefited from psychophysical olfactory evaluations, there were 75 anosmic, 43 hyposmic and 113 normosmic patients. The prevalence of anosmia significantly decreased with the severity of the disease. Anosmia or hyposmia were not associated with any nasal disorder, according to SNOT-22. CONCLUSION: OD and GD are more prevalent in patients with mild COVID-19 compared with individuals with moderate, severe or critical diseases. Females might have a higher risk of developing OD and GD compared with males.","Lechien, Jerome R; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos M; Varia, Luigi A; De Riu, Giacomo; Cammaroto, Giovanni; Chekkoury-Idrissi, Younes; Circiu, Marta; Distinguin, Lea; Journe, Fabrice; de Terwangne, Christophe; Machayekhi, Shahram; Barillari, Maria R; Calvo-Henriquez, Christian; Hans, Stéphane; Saussez, Sven",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,478

No drug has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy for COVID-19. Immunomodulatory treatment with hydroxychloroquine and biologics as tocilizumab, in fact, has not proven to show satisfactory results in several reports. We therefore treated a selected patient with interstitial multifocal pneumonia, positive to COVID-19, with polyclonal preparation of immunoglobulins as an adjuvant therapy, obtaining in few days clinical remission and improvements in radiological findings. Based on this case report, we suggest that clinical trials are conducted to test the efficacy and safety of polyclonal immunoglobulins for adjunctive therapy of COVID-19.","Carannante, Novella; Fiorentino, Giuseppe; Corcione, Antonio; Di Sarno, Raffaele; Spatarella, Micaela; Maturo, Nicola; Fragranza, Fiorentino; Di Micco, Pierpaolo",Front Med (Lausanne),,478
207207,Pharmacologic treatment of COVID-19: Evidence-based update,2021,"BACKGROUND: Accurately predicting outcomes for cancer patients with COVID-19 has been clinically challenging. Numerous clinical variables have been retrospectively associated with disease severity, but the predictive value of these variables, and how multiple variables interact to increase risk, remains unclear. METHODS: We used machine learning algorithms to predict COVID-19 severity in 348 cancer patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. Using only clinical variables collected on or before a patient's COVID-19 positive date (time zero), we sought to classify patients into one of three possible future outcomes: Severe-early (the patient required high levels of oxygen support within 3 days of being tested positive for COVID-19), Severe-late (the patient required high levels of oxygen after 3 days), and Non-severe (the patient never required oxygen support). RESULTS: Our algorithm classified patients into these classes with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) ranging from 70 to 85%, significantly outperforming prior methods and univariate analyses. Critically, classification accuracy is highest when using a potpourri of clinical variables - including basic patient information, pre-existing diagnoses, laboratory and radiological work, and underlying cancer type - suggesting that COVID-19 in cancer patients comes with numerous, combinatorial risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we provide a computational tool that can identify high-risk patients early in their disease progression, which could aid in clinical decision-making and selecting treatment options.","Navlakha, Saket; Morjaria, Sejal; Perez-Johnston, Rocio; Zhang, Allen; Taur, Ying",BMC Infect Dis,,478

The SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein protein is one of the main focus of COVID-19 related research as it is a structural protein that facilitates its attachment, entry, and infection to the host cells. We have focused our work on mutations in two of the several functional domains in the virus spike glycoprotein, namely, receptor-binding domain (RBD) and heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain. These domains are majorly responsible for the stability of spike glycoprotein and play a key role in the host cell attachment and infection. In our study, several mutations like R408I, L455Y, F486L, Q493N, Q498Y, N501T of RBD (319-591), and A930V, D936Y of HR1 (912-984) have been studied to examine its role on the spike glycoprotein native structure. Comparisons of MD simulations in the WT and mutants revealed a significant de-stabilization effect of the mutations on RBD and HR1 domains. We have investigated the impact of mapped mutations on the stability of the spike glycoprotein, before binding to the receptor, which may be consequential to its binding properties to the receptor and other ligands.

The virus itself not only invades and destroys the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-expressing cells of the lungs, kidneys, liver, etc. but also elicits a hyperinflammatory immune response, further damaging the tissue leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. Although vaccines, as a prime example of active immunotherapy, have clearly disrupted the transmission of virus and reduced mortality, hospitalization, and burden of disease, other avenues of immunotherapy are also being explored. One such approach would be to adoptively transfer modified/unmodified immune cells to the critically ill.

Here one particular such question is addressed: what will happen if large numbers of metropolitan people visit a less populated province during the summer vacation? By means of a simple epidemic model, allowing for both short and long-term visitors to the province, it is studied which features are most influential in determining if such summer movements will result in large number of infections among the province population. The method is applied to the island of Gotland off the South East coast of Sweden. It is shown that the amount of mixing between the metropolitan and province groups and the fraction of metropolitan people being infectious upon arrival are most influential. Consequently, minimizing events gathering both the province and metropolitan groups and/or reducing the number of short-term visitors could substantially decrease spreading, as could measures to lower the fraction initially infectious upon arrival.","Britton, Tom; Ball, Frank",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00579v1.pdf,478

By re-interpreting the data in geographical terms, this work aims to contribute to the analysis of the plagues from a geo-historic perspective, with the intention of verifying whether the spread, development and effects of these phenomena have common trends, while taking into account the different socio-economic and territorial aspects that characterize the various contexts.","Podda, Cinzia; Secchi, Paolo",Documenti Geografici,,478
209730,Defining causality in COVID-19 and neurological disorders,2020,"BACKGROUND: The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is holding the world in its grip. Epidemiologists have shown that the mortality risks are higher when the health care system is subjected to pressure from COVID-19. It is therefore of great importance to maintain the health of health care providers and prevent contamination. An important group who will be required to treat patients with COVID-19 are health care providers during semiacute surgery. There are concerns that laparoscopic surgery increases the risk of contamination more than open surgery; therefore, balancing the safety of health care providers with the benefit of laparoscopic surgery for the patient is vital. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to provide an overview of potential contamination routes and possible risks for health care providers; we also aimed to propose research questions based on current literature and expert opinions about performing laparoscopic surgery on patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a scoping review, adding five additional questions concerning possible contaminating routes. A systematic search was performed on the PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases, adding results from gray literature as well. The search not only included COVID-19 but was extended to virus contamination in general. We excluded society and professional association statements about COVID-19 if they did not add new insights to the available literature. RESULTS: The initial search provided 2007 records, after which 267 full-text papers were considered. Finally, we used 84 papers, of which 14 discussed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Eight papers discussed the added value of performing intubation in a low-pressure operating room, mainly based on the SARS outbreak experience in 2003. Thirteen papers elaborated on the risks of intubation for health care providers and SARS-CoV-2, and 19 papers discussed this situation with other viruses. They conclude that there is significant evidence that intubation and extubation is a high-risk aerosol-producing procedure. No papers were found on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 and surgical smoke, although 25 papers did provide conflicting evidence on the infection risk of human papillomavirus, hepatitis B, polio, and rabies. No papers were found discussing tissue extraction or the deflation risk of the pneumoperitoneum after laparoscopic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: There seems to be consensus in the literature that intubation and extubation are high-risk procedures for health care providers and that maximum protective equipment is needed. On the other hand, minimal evidence is available of the actual risk of contamination of health care providers during laparoscopy itself, nor of operating room pressure, surgical smoke, tissue extraction, or CO2 deflation. However, new studies are being published daily from current experiences, and society statements are continuously updated. There seems to be no reason to abandon laparoscopic surgery in favor of open surgery. However, the risks should not be underestimated, surgery should be performed on patients with COVID-19 only when necessary, and health care providers should use logic and common sense to protect themselves and others by performing surgery in a safe and protected environment.","de Leeuw, Robert Adrianus; Burger, Nicole Birgit; Ceccaroni, Marcello; Zhang, Jian; Tuynman, Jurriaan; Mabrouk, Mohamed; Barri Soldevila, Pere; Bonjer, Hendrik Jaap; Ankum, Pim; Huirne, Judith",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,478

And if these foam components are important, one has to determine by which mechanisms, and which microscopic parameters involved in these mechanisms are eventually crucial. I report here recent experimental results, shedding light on these issues. It allows us to summarize how the surfactant, the liquid bulk properties, and the gas modify or not the drainage and coarsening features.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed baseline characteristics, clinical course and findings of COVID-19, hospitalization and death rates, overall survival and case fatality rates of HSCT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 retrospectively. RESULTS: 57.6% of the patients underwent AHSCT, and 42.4% underwent allo-HSCT. 60.6%, 27.3%, and 12.1% of the patients had mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 or critical illness, respectively. 45.5% were hospitalized, and 12.1% required intensive care. 9.1% necessitated invasive mechanical ventilation. The total CFR was 9.1% in HSCT recipients, 22.2% in patients with active hematologic malignancy and 4.2% in patients without active hematologic malignancy.

215028,An Unusual Presentation of COVID-19: Hemorrhagic Pericardial Effusion With Tamponade Physiology,2021,"Within-host models of COVID-19 infection dynamics enable the merits of different forms of antiviral therapy to be assessed in individual patients. A stochastic agent-based model of COVID-19 intracellular dynamics is introduced here, that incorporates essential steps of the viral life cycle targeted by treatment options. Integration of model predictions with an intercellular ODE model of within-host infection dynamics, fitted to patient data, generates a generic profile of disease progression in patients that have recovered in the absence of treatment. This is contrasted with the profiles obtained after variation of model parameters pertinent to the immune response, such as effector cell and antibody proliferation rates, mimicking disease progression in immunocompromised patients. These profiles are then compared with disease progression in the presence of antiviral and convalescent plasma therapy against COVID-19 infections. The model reveals that using both therapies in combination can be very effective in reducing the length of infection, but these synergistic effects decline with a delayed treatment start. Conversely, early treatment with either therapy alone can actually increase the duration of infection, with infectious virions still present after the decline of other markers of infection. This suggests that usage of these treatments should remain carefully controlled in a clinical environment.","Fatehi, Farzad; Bingham, Richard J; Dykeman, Eric C; Stockley, Peter G; Twarock, Reidun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08957v2.pdf,478

Medical schools social accountability focuses on the training, healthcare provision and research services they offer. The principles of medical education and the structure proposed by the Flexner Report are in crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and redefinition of the social contract is required. This document offers a proposal for medical schools social accountability that includes anticipation of the needs of the community, patient-centered inter-professional care, training of people in the area of health and collaboration between institutions. It highlights the need for a conscious institution that finds new training spaces other than hospitals, where each patient is cared for in a personalized way, with inter-professional training models that consider the student as a person who takes care of him/herself in open collaboration with organizations. Leaders must act now because it is their social accountability and because it is the right thing to do.","Abreu-Hernández, Luis F; Valdez-García, Jorge E; Esperón-Hernández, Ramón I; Olivares-Olivares, Silvia L",Gac Med Mex,,478
215634,Nonparametric fuzzy hypothesis testing for quantiles applied to clinical characteristics of COVID-19,2021,"Many human viral diseases are a consequence of a zoonotic event. Some of the diseases caused by these zoonotic events have affected millions of people around the world, some of which have resulted in high rates of mor-bidity/mortality in humans. Changes in the viral proteins that function as ligands of the host receptor may promote the spillover between species. The most recent of these zoonotic events that have caused an ongoing epidemic of high magnitude is the Covid-19 epidemics caused by SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to determine the mutation(s) in the sequence of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 that might be favoring human to human transmission. An in silico approach was performed, and changes were detected in the S1 subunit of the receptor-binding domain of spike. The observed changes have significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 spike/ACE2 interaction and produce a reduction in the binding energy, compared to the one of the Bat-CoV to this receptor. The data presented in this study suggest a higher affinity of the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein to the human ACE2 receptor, compared to the one of Bat-CoV spike and ACE2. This could be the cause of the rapid viral spread of SARS-CoV-2 in humans.","Ortega, Joseph Thomas; Serrano, Maria Luisa; Pujol, Flor Helene; Rangel, Hector Rafael",EXCLI J.,,478

However, these restrictions come with a substantial price tag. It is crucial for governments to form anti-virus strategies that balance the trade-off between protecting public health and minimizing the economic cost. This work proposes a probabilistic programming method to quantify the efficiency of major non-pharmaceutical interventions. We present a generative simulation model that accounts for the economic and human capital cost of adopting such strategies, and provide an end-to-end pipeline to simulate the virus spread and the incurred loss of various policy combinations. By investigating the national response in 10 countries covering four continents, we found that social distancing coupled with contact tracing is the most successful policy, reducing the virus transmission rate by 96\% along with a 98\% reduction in economic and human capital loss. Together with experimental results, we open-sourced a framework to test the efficacy of each policy combination.","Zhunis, Assem; Mai, Tung-Duong; Kim, Sundong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00192v1.pdf,478

Presently, there remains no effective vaccine or efficient treatment strategies against COVID-19. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are medicines very widely used to alleviate fever, pain, and inflammation (common symptoms of COVID-19 patients) through effectively blocking production of prostaglandins (PGs) via inhibition of cyclooxyganase enzymes. PGs can exert either proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects depending on the inflammatory scenario. In this review, we survey the potential roles that NSAIDs and PGs may play during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development and progression of COVID-19.

216198,Role of data science in managing COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Ghana confirmed the first two cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) infection on 12th March 2020. Following this, the government introduced routine and enhanced contact tracing to identify, quarantine, and test contacts for COVID-19. This study, therefore, intends to document the experiences of contact tracers, their supervisors, during COVID-19 containment in Ghana. METHODS: Purposive sampling was used to select twenty-seven (27) participants; sixteen contact tracers, six supervisors, and five contacts of COVID-19 cases for an in-depth interview using a topic guide. These interviews were conducted on a phone or face-to-face basis whilst maintaining physical distancing protocol. All these were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Then, QSR NVivo 12 was used to analyse the data thematically. RESULTS: Contact tracers were selected based on their professional background and surveillance experience with other infectious diseases. They were trained before the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country and before deployment. Deployment of contact tracers was in pairs to monitor contacts daily through physical visits or over the phone. Their activities included educating contacts about the condition, filling the symptoms diary, and providing psychological support. Contacts for COVID-19 were identified through case investigation, and their monitoring is done once a day despite the twice-daily requirement. Wherever a case was confirmed, enhanced contact tracing within a 2km radius was done. Furthermore, it was reported that some contacts were not adhering to the self-quarantine. In addition to this, other challenges included; unstable provision of PPEs and remuneration, refusal of some contact to test, delays in receiving test results, and poor coordination of the whole process. CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that contact tracing was generally perceived to be helpful in COVID-19 containment in Ghana. However, adhering to self-quarantine protocol had many challenges for both contact tracers and the contacts. Improving coordination and quick release of test results to contacts is necessary for COVID-19 containment. Lastly, the supply of Personal Protection Equipment and motivation needs to be addressed to help position the country well for effective contact tracing.","Asiimwe, Nashira; Tabong, Philip Teg-Nefaah; Iro, Stanley Amogu; Noora, Charles Lwanga; Opoku-Mensah, Kwabena; Asampong, Emmanuel",PLoS One,,478

One area that is implementing is the city of Surabaya by implementing Perwali number 28 of 2020 regarding the guidelines for the new normal order in the 2019 corona virus disease pandemic conditions (COVID-19) in Surabaya city. In preventing the spread of COVID-19 a foundation is needed in carrying out the implementation of the Surabaya mayor’s policy. It is expected that the participation between the government in this case the mayor of Surabaya and the community can be carried out properly in line with the enactment of the regulation. Concrete manifestation of the implementation of the policy is the existence of a formidable village program as one of the intermediary programs of the policy of the mayor of Surabaya. The purpose of this study was to identify and analyze the new normal implementation in RT 04 RW 14 Kalirungkut Surabaya city based on Perwali number 28 tahun 2020. The type of research in this study is qualitative with descriptive methods. The technique of determining informants is by means of purposive sampling by collecting data information in the form of primary data and secondary data. Which is primary or direct data obtained from interviews and observations. While secondary data obtained from various references such as books and journals that support this research. The results showed that the implementation factors were communication resources disposition and bureaucratic structure.

217653,Recognition and treatment of devastating vasculopathic systemic disorders: Coronavirus disease 2019 and rickettsioses,2021,"The invariable governmental approach to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been to effect the White Knight stance of Don Quixote, defending the population from the ""Virus Dragon"" and dedicating its knight-errantry to the damsel Dulcinea. Though essential, new therapeutics, vaccines, physical distancing, rigorous hygiene standards and efficient health systems are not sufficient to counter the effects of the virus. Individual compliance to public health guidelines also matters, while remaining similarly insufficient to diminish the threat. Earthier, citizen-led, community participation strategies, however, lead to innovative, tailored solutions that better fulfil the needs of diverse neighbourhoods and assures greater virus resistance and increase in population health compared to a top-down, knightly approach or isolated individual efforts. The challenge of COVID-19 offers communities a moment to build more resilient, antifragile communities that not only survive the current crisis, but that thrive after it, and that are better equipped for the next challenge. This is not the time for the singular heroics of the White Knight, or the antics of Don Quixote, tilting at windmills. It is the time of Sancho Panza, which is to say of regular non-credentialed citizens, and their collective efforts, who up to now have largely been considered pawns in this contest. Asset-based community development (ABCD) rejects both the individual as an island and the institutional, knightly emphasis on assessing needs and deficits within communities. It favours identifying and mobilising available and latent assets within a community to forge closer connections among all people, the better to collectivise problem-solving efforts. Community-driven initiatives are assisted in this by localised not-for-profit agencies that practice subsidiarity.","Russell, Cormac","Gac. sanit. (Barc., Ed. impr.)",,478
217695,The SADDEN DEATH Study: Results from a Pilot Study in Non-ICU COVID-19 Spanish Patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC), which is related with insulin resistance, is a one of the most common cancers. Triglyceride-glucose index (TyG index) was made for a marker of insulin resistance. We conducted the investigation of association between TyG index and incident CRC. METHODS: We examined the affect of TyG index on incident CRC in this historical cohort study of 27,944 (16,454 men and 11,490 women) participants. TyG index was calculated as ln [fasting triglycerides (mg/dL) × fasting plasma glucose (mg/dL)/2]. The impact of TyG index on incident CRC was investigated using Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for sex, age, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, exercise, systolic blood pressure and creatinine. The covariate-adjusted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve calculated the area under the curve (AUC) and cut-off value of TyG index for the incidence of CRC. RESULTS: During the median 4.4-year follow-up, 116 participants were diagnosed as CRC. The cumulative incidence rate of CRC were 0.4%. In Cox proportional hazard model, the HRs of TyG index were 1.38 (95% Confidence interval (CI), 1.00-1.91, p = 0.049) after adjusting for covariates. In the covariate-adjusted ROC curve analysis, the cut-off value of TyG index for incident CRC was 8.272 (AUC 0.687 (95%CI, 0.637-737, sensitivity = 0.620, specificity = 0.668, p < 0.001)). CONCLUSIONS: TyG index can predict the onset of CRC. For early detection of CRC, we should encourage people with high TyG index to undergo screening for CRC.","Okamura, Takuro; Hashimoto, Yoshitaka; Hamaguchi, Masahide; Obora, Akihiro; Kojima, Takao; Fukui, Michiaki",BMC Endocr Disord,,478
217696,The SADDEN DEATH Study: Results from a Pilot Study in Non-ICU COVID-19 Spanish Patients,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increased level of anxiety and fear among the general population related to its management and infection spread. Considering the relevance of present circumstances, we explored perceptions and attitudes of community members towards their mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study using a purposive sampling approach, at two communities of Karachi, Pakistan. PARTICIPANTS: In-depth interviews were conducted with community members including, young adults, middle-aged adults and older adults of both genders. Study data were analysed manually using the thematic analysis technique. PRIMARY OUTCOME: The primary outcome is assessing community perception towards their mental well-being amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 27 in-depth interviews were conducted, between May and June 2020. Three overarching themes were identified: (1) impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of the general communities; (2) current coping mechanisms to adapt to the new reality and (3) recommendations to address the mental health of communities. Generally, community members underwent increased anxiety and fear due to the contagious nature of the virus. Alongside, social, financial and religious repercussions of the pandemic have also heightened psychological distress among community members. However, community members were able to point out some of the coping mechanisms such as getting closer to God, connecting with family, participating in mental health sessions and resetting lives by indulging in diverse activities. Simultaneously, they also recommended the need for remote mental health services for elders and continuous efforts by the government to address the mental health needs of the community. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-associated mental health consequences have hit every individual in society. The study finding has the potential to guide the development of context-specific innovative mental health programmes to overcome the pandemic repercussions.","Ali, Naureen Akber; Feroz, Anam Shahil; Akber, Noshaba; Feroz, Rida; Nazim Meghani, Salima; Saleem, Sarah",BMJ Open,,478

218398,COVID-19 Illness in a Patient With Anti-Glomerular Basement Membrane Disease: A Clinical Dilemma,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Ad-hoc guidelines for managing the COVID-19 pandemic are published worldwide. We investigated international applications of such policies in the urologic-oncology community. METHODS: A 20-item survey was e-mailed via SurveyMonkey to 100 international senior urologic-oncology surgeons. Leaders' policies regarding clinical/surgical management and medical education were surveyed probing demographics, affiliations, urologic-oncologic areas of interest, and current transportation restrictions. Data on COVID-19 burden were retrieved from the ECDC. Statistical analyses employed non-parametric tests (SPSS v.25.0, IBM). RESULTS: Of 100 leaders from 17 countries, 63 responded to our survey, with 58 (92%) reporting university and/or cancer-center affiliations. Policies on new-patient visits remained mostly unchanged, while follow-up visits for low-risk diseases were mostly postponed, for example, 83.3% for small renal mass (SRM). Radical prostatectomy was delayed in 76.2% of cases, while maintaining scheduled timing for radical cystectomy (71.7%). Delays were longer in Europe than in the Americas for kidney cancer (SRM follow-up, Pâ¯=â¯0.014), prostate cancer (new visits, Pâ¯=â¯0.003), and intravesical therapy for intermediate-risk bladder cancer (Pâ¯=â¯0.043). In Europe, COVID-19 burden correlated with policy adaptation, for example, nephrectomy delays for T2 disease (râ¯=â¯0.5, P =0.005). Regarding education policies, trainees' medical education was mainly unchanged, whereas senior urologists' planned attendance at professional meetings dropped from 6 (IQR 1-11) to 2 (IQR 0-5) (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Under COVID-19, senior urologic-oncology surgeons worldwide apply risk-stratified approaches to timing of clinical and surgical schedules. Policies regarding trainee education were not significantly affected. We suggest establishment of an international consortium to create a directive for coping with such future challenges to global healthcare.","Rosenzweig, Barak; Bex, Axel; Dotan, Zohar A; Frydenberg, Mark; Klotz, Laurence; Lotan, Yair; Schulman, Claude C; Tsaur, Igor; Ramon, Jacob",Urol Oncol,,478

Our inclusion criteria were guidelines, recommendations, or best practice statements by international urology organizations and reference centers about urological care in different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Of 366 titles identified, 15 guidelines met our criteria. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of the 15 guidelines, 14 addressed emergency situations and 12 reported on assessment of elective uro-oncology procedures. There was consensus on postponing radical prostatectomy except for high-risk prostate cancer, and delaying treatment for low-grade bladder cancer, small renal masses up to T2, and stage I seminoma. According to nine guidelines that addressed endourology, obstructed or infected kidneys should be decompressed, whereas nonobstructing stones and stent removal should be rescheduled. Five guidelines/recommendations discussed laparoscopic and robotic surgery, while the remaining recommendations focused on outpatient procedures and consultations. All recommendations represented expert opinions, with three specifically endorsed by professional societies. Only the European Association of Urology guidelines provided evidence-based levels of evidence (mostly level 3 evidence). CONCLUSIONS: To make informed decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are multiple national and international guidelines and recommendations for urologists to prioritize the provision of care. Differences among the guidelines were minimal. PATIENT SUMMARY: We performed a systematic review of published recommendations on urological practice during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which provide guidance on prioritizing the timing for different types of urological care.","Heldwein, Flavio Lobo; Loeb, Stacy; Wroclawski, Marcelo Langer; Sridhar, Ashwin Narasimha; Carneiro, Arie; Lima, Fabio Sepulveda; Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun",Eur Urol Focus,,478

Aims To check the dose-response model for stress between the number of COVID-19-related stressful events and mental health indices. Method We conducted two cross-sectional studies, using internet survey samples across the UK (N = 1293 for study 1;N = 1073 for study 2). Samples used internet panel surveys during March-April 2020 and 3 months later (June 2020), and used random stratified samples. Studies assessed prevalence of serious risk of mental illness and probable ICD-11 adjustment disorder. Results Elevated risk of serious mental illness was found among those with COVID-19-related social life or occupationally stressful events (study 1). Elevated risk of serious mental illness and probable ICD-11 adjustment disorder was evident among those reporting COVID-19-related stressful events (personal health problems and caregiving;study 2). Cumulative COVID-19-related stressful events were associated with elevated risk of serious mental illness in study 1 (odds ratio 1.65;95% CI 1.03-2.64;P = 0.037), and with both elevated risk of serious mental illness (odds ratio 2.19;95% CI 1.15-4.15;P = 0.017) and probable ICD-11 adjustment disorder (odds ratio 2.45;95% CI 1.27-4.72;P = 0.007) in study 2. Conclusions Psychiatrists should be aware that COVID-19-related stressful events can lead to serious psychological problems. Mental health professionals need to pay particular attention to patients who report cumulative COVID-19-related stressful events, and consider them for mental health assessment and treatment.","Ben-Ezra, M.; Hou, W.

221374,Global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stroke hospitalizations and mechanical thrombectomy volumes: A society of vascular and interventional neurology COVID-19 international collaboration,2021,"This study aimed to explore key regulatory connections underlying lung transplant rejection. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between rejection and stable lung transplantation (LTx) samples were screened using R package limma, followed by functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction network construction. Subsequently, a global triple network, including miRNAs, mRNAs, and transcription factors (TFs), was constructed. Furthermore, immune cell infiltration characteristics were analyzed to investigate the molecular immunology of lung transplant rejection. Finally, potential drug-target interactions were generated. In brief, 739 DEGs were found between rejection and stable LTx samples. PTPRC, IL-6, ITGAM, CD86, TLR8, TYROBP, CXCL10, ITGB2, and CCR5 were defined as hub genes. Eight TFs, including STAT1, SPIB, NFKB1, SPI1, STAT5A, RUNX1, VENTX, and BATF, and five miRNAs, including miR-335-5p, miR-26b-5p, miR-124-3p, miR-1-3p, and miR-155-5p, were involved in regulating hub genes. The immune cell infiltration analysis revealed higher proportions of activated memory CD4 T cells, follicular helper T cells, Î³Î´ T cells, monocytes, M1 and M2 macrophages, and eosinophils in rejection samples, besides lower proportions of resting memory CD4 T cells, regulatory T cells, activated NK cells, M0 macrophages, and resting mast cells. This study provided a comprehensive perspective of the molecular co-regulatory network underlying lung transplant rejection.","Xiu, Meng-Xi; Liu, Zu-Ting; Tang, Jian",Int Immunopharmacol,,478
221765,Organ transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic: Making the best patient care decision,2020,"STUDY DESIGN: Original research, cross-sectional study. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate patient satisfaction with spine care delivered via telemedicine. Identify patient- and visit-based factors associated with increased satisfaction and visit preference. METHODS: Telemedicine visits with a spine surgeon at 2 practices in the United States between March and May 2020 were eligible for inclusion in the study. Patients were sent an electronic survey recording overall satisfaction, technical or clinical issues encountered, and preference for a telemedicine versus an in-person visit. Factors associated with poor satisfaction and preference of telemedicine over an in-person visit were identified using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 772 responses were collected. Overall, 87.7% of patients were satisfied with their telemedicine visit and 45% indicated a preference for a telemedicine visit over an in-person visit if given the option. Patients with technical or clinical issues were significantly less likely to achieve 5 out of 5 satisfaction scores and were significantly more likely to prefer an in-person visit. Patients who live less than 5 miles from their surgeon's office and patients older than 60 years were also significantly more likely to prefer in-person visits. CONCLUSIONS: Spine telemedicine visits during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with high patient satisfaction. Additionally, 45% of respondents indicated a preference for telemedicine versus an in-patient visit in the future. In light of these findings, telemedicine for spine care may be a preferable option for a subset of patients into the future.","Satin, Alexander M; Shenoy, Kartik; Sheha, Evan D; Basques, Bryce; Schroeder, Gregory D; Vaccaro, Alexander R; Lieberman, Isador H; Guyer, Richard D; Derman, Peter B",Global Spine J,,478
221900,Contrastive Learning Improves Critical Event Prediction in COVID-19 Patients,2021,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi enhance plant salt tolerance. However, physiological mechanisms of enhanced salt tolerance in leaves and roots of trees rarely have been compared. To reveal the different mechanisms, our study utilized comprehensive analyses of leaves and roots to examine the effects of Funneliformis mosseae on the salinity tolerance of Zelkova serrata. Seedlings of Z. serrata were exposed to four salt levels in a greenhouse with and without F. mosseae inoculation. Treatment comparisons revealed that following F. mosseae inoculation, (1) nutrient deficiency caused by osmotic stress was mitigated by the fungus enhancing nutrient contents (K, Ca, and Mg) in roots and (N, P, K, Ca, and Mg) in leaves, with Ca and K contents being higher in both leaves and roots; (2) mycorrhizas alleviated ion toxicity by maintaining a favorable ion balance (e.g., K+/Na+), and this regulatory effect was higher in leaves than that in roots; and (3) oxidative damage was reduced by an increase in the activities of antioxidant enzymes and accumulation of antioxidant compounds in mycorrhizal plants although the increase differed in leaves and roots. In particular, AM fungus-enhanced catalase activity and reduced glutathione content only occurred in leaves, whereas an enhanced content of reduced ascorbic acid was only noted in roots. Growth, root vitality, leaf photosynthetic pigments, net photosynthetic rate, and dry weight were higher in seedlings with AM fungus inoculation. These results suggest that AM fungus inoculation improved salinity tolerance of Z. serrata, but the physiological mechanisms differed between leaves and roots.","Wang, Jinping; Zhai, Lu; Ma, Jieyi; Zhang, Jinchi; Wang, G Geoff; Liu, Xin; Zhang, Shuifeng; Song, Juan; Wu, Yingkang",Mycorrhiza,,478

222246,Digital health strategies in the war against COVID-19 and beyond,2020,"Background & objectives: Nearly 5,500 tests for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had been conducted on March 31, 2020 across the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-approved public and private laboratories in India. Given the need to rapidly increase testing coverage, we undertook an exercise to explore and quantify interventions to increase the daily real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)-based testing capacity over the next few months. The objective of this exercise was to prepare a potential plan to scale-up COVID-19 testing in India in the public sector. Methods: Potential increase in daily testing capacity of the existing public laboratories was calculated across the three base scenarios of shifts (9, 16 and 24 h). Additional testing capacity was added for each shift scenario based on interventions ranging from procurement of additional qRT-PCR machines, leveraging spare capacity on available qRT-PCR machines not drafted into COVID-19 testing, to in-laboratory process optimization efforts. Results: Moving to a 24 h working model in the existing approved laboratories can enhance the daily testing capacity to 40,464 tests/day. The capacity can be further bolstered by leveraging qRT-PCR and nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-based machines available with the Multidisciplinary Research Units (MRUs), National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP). Using combination/multiplex kits, and provision of automated RNA extraction platforms at all laboratories could also optimize run time and contribute to capacity increase by 1.5-2 times. Interpretation & conclusions: Adopting these interventions could help increase public sector's daily testing capacity to nearly 100,000-120,000 tests/day. It is important to note that utilization of the scaled-up testing capacity will require deployment of additional workforce, procurement of corresponding commodities for testing and scale-up of sample collection and transportation efforts.","Gupta, Nivedita; Bhatnagar, Tarun; Rade, Kiran; Murhekar, Manoj; Gangakhedkar, Raman R; Nagar, Anu",Indian J Med Res,,478

But these figures were estimated before the full Covid-19 pandemic ensued. With 1.5 million people in the UK now socially shielding, and with the rest of the country in lockdown for weeks, it is not surprising that there has been a surge in online medical advice and services. 2Driven by the rapid growth in remote patient monitoring, virtual GP consultations and online prescription services, the telehealth market has enjoyed a significant boom. However, this has created a lucrative opportunity for fraudsters. Over 1 billion patient health records can be easily accessed on the dark web and millions of additional records are being added daily. Medical records command a high value to bad actors.

223798,Impact of COVID-19 in patients with lymphoid malignancies,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Numerous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological tests exists commercially; however, their performance using clinical samples is limited. Although insufficient to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of infection, antibody assays can be of great use for surveillance studies or for some coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients presenting late to the hospital. METHODS: This study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of four commercial SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow antibody tests using 213 serum specimens from 90 PCR-positive confirmed COVID-19 patients. Of 59 negative control sera, 50 were obtained from patients with other respiratory infectious diseases before COVID-19 pandemic began while nine were from patients infected with other respiratory viruses, including two seasonal coronaviruses. RESULTS: The varied sensitivities for the four commercial kits were 70.9%, 65.3%, 45.1%, and 65.7% for BioMedomics, Autobio Diagnostics, Genbody, and KURABO, respectively, between sick days 1 and 155 in COVID-19 patients. The sensitivities of the four tests gradually increased over time after infection before sick day 5 (15.0%, 12.5%, 15.0%, and 20.0%); from sick day 11-15 (95.7%, 87.2%, 53.2%, and 89.4%); and after sick day 20 (100%, 100%, 68.6%, and 96.1%), respectively. For severe illness, the sensitivities were quite high in the late phase after sick day 15. The specificities were over 96% for all four tests. No cross-reaction due to other pathogens, including seasonal coronaviruses, was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated the large differences in the antibody test performances. This ought to be considered when performing surveillance analysis.","Ashizawa, Nobuyuki; Takazono, Takahiro; Ohyama, Kaname; Nagasaki, Yoji; Okamoto, Masaki; Hirayama, Tatsuro; Takahashi, Kensuke; Yamanashi, Hirotomo; Tashiro, Masato; Hosogaya, Naoki; Tanaka, Takeshi; Yamamoto, Kazuko; Fukuda, Yuichi; Imamura, Yoshifumi; Kawanami, Toshinori; Miyazaki, Taiga; Sawai, Toyomitsu; Fukushima, Kiyoyasu; Yatera, Kazuhiro; Yanagihara, Katsunori; Izumikawa, Koichi; Mukae, Hiroshi",J Infect Chemother,,478

225089,Life-threatening cardiac tamponade complicating myo-pericarditis in COVID-19. (Focus issue on Coronavirus/COVID-19.),2020,"COVID-19, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2, is characterized by various symptoms, ranging from mild fatigue to life-threatening pneumonia, “cytokine storm,” and multiorgan failure. The manifestation of COVID-19 may lead to a cytokine storm, i.e., it facilitates viral replication that triggers a strong release of cytokines, which then modulates the immune system and results in hyperinflammation. Today’s diet is high in omega-6 fatty acids and deficient in omega-3 fatty acids;this, along with a high fructose intake, leads to obesity, which is a chronic state of low-grade inflammation. Omega-6 fatty acids are proinflammatory and prothrombotic whereas omega-3 fatty acids are less proinflammatory and thrombotic. Furthermore, omega-3 fatty acids make specialized lipid mediators, namely resolvins, protectins, and maresins, that are potent anti-inflammatory agents. Throughout evolution there was a balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids with a ratio of 1–2/1 omega-6/omega-3, but today this ratio is 16–20/1 omega-6/omega-3, leading to a proinflammatory state. In addition, genetic variants in FADS1, FADS2, ELOV-2, and ELOV-5 lead to a more efficient biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), e.g., of linoleic acid (LA) to arachidonic acid (ARA), and (alpha-linolenic acid) (ALA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), leading to higher ARA levels. Because the US diet is already high in omega-6 fatty acids, the increased biosynthesis of ARA in people with the derived FADS haplotype (haplotype D) leads to an increased production of leukotrienes, thromboxanes, C-reactive protein (CRP), and eventually elevated levels of cytokines, like interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which may increase susceptibility to COVID-19. About 80% of African Americans, 50% of Hispanics, and 45% of European Americans have the FADS haplotype D and are thus efficient metabolizers, which could account for the higher vulnerability of these populations to COVID-19. Therefore, another reason that African Americans and Hispanics are more susceptible to COVID-19 is that they have a higher frequency of haplotype D, which is no longer beneficial in today’s environment and diet. Genetic variation must be considered in all studies of disease development and therapy because it is important to the practice of precision nutrition by physicians and other health professionals. The objective of this commentary is to emphasize the importance of genetic variation within populations and its interaction with diet in the development of disease. Differences in the frequency of genes and their interactions with nutrients in various population groups must be considered among the factors contributing to health disparities in the development of COVID-19. A balanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio is essential to health. Physicians should measure their patients’ fatty acids and recommend decreasing the intake of foods rich in omega-6 fatty acids and increasing the intake of omega-3 fatty acids along with fruits and vegetables.","Simopoulos, Artemis P.",Lifestyle Genomics,,478
225766,Cancer Surgery During COVID-19: How We Move Forward,2020,"Toxoplasmosis is a globally spread disease, affecting humans and many animal species, including birds. Antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii were detected in ostriches from South and North America, Africa and Asia. Except for one study from Spain, there is a lack of information about T. gondii seroprevalence in ostriches from Europe. For this reason, the aim of the study was to detect antibodies to T. gondii in farm-reared ostriches from the Czech Republic. Serum samples of 409 ostriches (Struthio camelus), collected at 9 farms were tested by Latex agglutination test. Antibodies to T. gondii were detected in 149 (36%) birds with a statistical difference for individual farms (8%-71%, p = 0.0121), and regions (8%-65%, p = 0.002). Seropositivity did not statistically differ (p > 0.05) in size of farms (50% and 35% on small and large farms, respectively), sex of birds (38% and 35% in males and females, respectively), season and year of collection. Tissue samples (brain, heart, and pectoral muscle) of 105 birds were also tested by PCR to detect T. gondii DNA. The parasite T. gondii was detected in the brain and heart of one seronegative ostrich (1%) from a small farm. Based on our results, we can assume that ostriches may present high risk of toxoplasmosis for humans through consumption of raw or undercooked ostrich meat and even seronegative individuals could harbor T. gondii in their tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first serological detection of T. gondii in ostriches in the Czech Republic, and the first PCR detection in Europe.","Bártová, E; Kobédová, K; Budíková, M; Racka, K",Int J Food Microbiol,,478
225855,Clinical and Chest Radiography Features Determine Patient Outcomes in Young and Middle-aged Adults with COVID-19,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 RNA is identified as a pivotal player to bolster energizing zones of COVID-19 detection. Herein, we develop a rapid and unamplified nanosensing platform for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human throat swab specimens. A gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-decorated graphene field-effect transistor (G-FET) sensor was fabricated, after which complementary phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligos (PMO) probe was immobilized on the AuNP surface. This sensor allowed for highly sensitive testing of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as PMO does not have charges, leading to low background signal. Not only did the method present a low limit of detection in PBS (0.37 fM), throat swab (2.29 fM), and serum (3.99 fM), but also it achieved a rapid response to COVID-19 patients' samples within 2 min. The developed nanosensor was capable of analyzing RNA extracts from 30 real clinical samples. The results show that the sensor could differentiate the healthy people from infected people, which are in high agreement with RT-PCR results (Kappa index = 0.92). Furthermore, a well-defined distinction between SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and SARS-CoV RdRp was also made. Therefore, we believe that this work provides a satisfactory, attractive option for COVID-19 diagnosis.","Li, Jiahao; Wu, Ding; Yu, Yi; Li, Tingxian; Li, Kun; Xiao, Meng-Meng; Li, Yirong; Zhang, Zhi-Yong; Zhang, Guo-Jun",Biosens Bioelectron,,478

226090,COVID-19 and cardiovascular problems in elderly patients: Food for thought,2021,"Introduction. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant medication, supply and equipment, and provider shortages, limiting the resources available for provision of surgical care. In response to mandates restricting surgery to high-acuity procedures during this period, our institution developed a multidisciplinary Low-Resource Operating Room (LROR) Taskforce in April 2020. This study describes our institutional experience developing an LROR to maintain access to urgent surgical procedures during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. A delineation of available resources and resource replacement strategies was conducted, and a final institution-wide plan for operationalizing the LROR was formed. Specialty-specific subgroups then convened to determine best practices and opportunities for LROR utilization. Orthopedic surgery performed in the LROR using wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet (WALANT) is presented as a use case. Results. Overall, 19 limited resources were identified, spanning across the domains of physical space, drugs, devices and equipment, and personnel. Based on the assessment, the decision to proceed with creation of an LROR was made. Sixteen urgent orthopedic surgeries were successfully performed using WALANT without conversion to general anesthesia. Conclusion. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a LROR was successfully designed and operationalized. The process for development of a LROR and recommended strategies for operating in a resource-constrained environment may serve as a model for other institutions and facilitate rapid implementation of this care model should the need arise in future pandemic or disaster situations.","Turcotte, Justin J; Gelfand, Jeffrey M; Jones, Christopher M; Jackson, Rubie S",Surg Innov,,478
226332,EEG findings in COVID-19 related encephalopathy,2020,"The global pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occasioned that most of the population in Spain was confined to home to reduce the risk of contagion. This affected mental health, increasing anxiety and worry about COVID-19 contagion. The aim of this study was assessing the moderation and mediation effect of cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) on general anxiety and whether the mediation effect was moderated by gender and/or age. A total of 1753 Spanish adults (78,6% female; M = 40.4 years, SD = 12.9) participated in an online survey that was available from March 26 to April 25 (2020) during the time period in which the population in Spain was confined. Participants completed measures of worry about COVID-19 contagion, the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire-Short (CERQ-Short) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Several models were tested through structural equation modelling. Moderation analyses reported that maladaptive strategies moderated positively anxiety, whereas adaptive strategies moderated negatively anxiety. Also, the best fitted mediation model found that worry about COVID-19 contagion and general anxiety was mediated by CERS in different directions. Maladaptive CERS increased anxiety, whereas adaptive CERS reduced anxiety. Age (not gender) also moderated this mediation, were younger adults presented an indirect effect only through maladaptive CERS, but older adults through both adaptive and maladaptive. Limitations are related to the study design which was a convenience sample. CERS moderated and mediated between worry about COVID-19 contagion and general anxiety. Prevention programs for mental health problems during the pandemic must be provided, especially for younger adults.","Muñoz-Navarro, Roger; Malonda, Elisabeth; Llorca-Mestre, Anna; Cano-Vindel, Antonio; Fernández-Berrocal, Pablo",J Psychiatr Res,,478

Other coronaviruses are causing epizootic representing a significant threat for both domestic and wild animals. Members of this viral family have the longest genome of all RNA viruses, and express up to 29 proteins establishing complex interactions with the host proteome. Deciphering these interactions is essential to identify cellular pathways hijacked by these viruses to replicate and escape innate immunity. Virus-host interactions also provide key information to select targets for antiviral drug development. Here, we have manually curated the literature to assemble a unique dataset of 1311 coronavirus-host protein-protein interactions. Functional enrichment and network-based analyses showed coronavirus connections to RNA processing and translation, DNA damage and pathogen sensing, interferon production, and metabolic pathways. In particular, this global analysis pinpointed overlooked interactions with translation modulators (GIGYF2-EIF4E2), components of the nuclear pore, proteins involved in mitochondria homeostasis (PHB, PHB2, STOML2), and methylation pathways (MAT2A/B). Finally, interactome data provided a rational for the antiviral activity of some drugs inhibiting coronaviruses replication. Altogether, this work describing the current landscape of coronavirus-host interactions provides valuable hints for understanding the pathophysiology of coronavirus infections and developing effective antiviral therapies.","Perrin-Cocon, Laure; Diaz, Olivier; Jacquemin, Clémence; Barthel, Valentine; Ogire, Eva; Ramière, Christophe; André, Patrice; Lotteau, Vincent; Vidalain, Pierre-Olivier",J Transl Med,,478
227811,"Prognostic Implication of Volumetric Quantitative CT Analysis in Patients with COVID-19: A Multicenter Study in Daegu, Korea",2020,"BACKGROUND: The recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread globally since its discovery in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. A comprehensive strategy - including surveillance, diagnostics, research, and clinical treatment - is urgently needed to win the battle against COVID-19. Recently, numerous studies have reported the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients. Yet, the incidence and viral transmission from the asymptomatic cases are not yet apparent. AIM: To estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among asymptomatic cases and describe its epidemiological and clinical significance this review systematically examined the published literature on SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients. METHODS: The literature was searched through four scientific databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Science Direct. RESULTS: Sixty-three studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. The majority of the reported studies were from China. However, there was a lack of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological studies, from several countries worldwide, tracing the actual incidence of COVID-19, especially in asymptomatic patients. Studies with a large sample size (>1000) estimated that the percentage of people contracting SARS-CoV-2 and likely to be asymptomatic ranged from 1.2-12.9%. However, other studies with a smaller sample size reported a much higher incidence and indicated that up to 87.9% of COVID-19 infected individuals could be asymptomatic. Most of these studies indicated that asymptopatics are a potential source of infection to the community. CONCLUSION: This review highlighted the need for more robust and well-designed studies to better estimate COVID-19 incidence among asymptomatic patients worldwide. Early identification of asymptomatic cases, as well as monitoring and tracing close contacts, could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.","Al-Sadeq, Duaa W; Nasrallah, Gheyath K",Int J Infect Dis,,478

Foram avaliados pelo teste tuberculinico, 353 ovinos das raças Santa Inês e Texel de duas propriedades da região de Pindamonhangaba - São Paulo. Dos 57 animais selecionados para abate, 31 apresentavam reação ao PPD bovino maior que ao PPD aviário e 26 com reação ao PPD bovino menor que ao PPD aviário. Onze animais (19,3%) apresentaram na necrópsia lesões sugestivas de tuberculose. Os órgãos afetados foram o fígado, linfonodo submandibular, intestino, pulmão, linfonodo mediastino e glândula mamária. Foram isoladas micobactérias de sete (12,3%) animais e a tipificação genética pelo método de PRA demonstrou cinco (71,42%) infectados pelo Mycobacterium flavescens 1, um (14,28%) pelo M. kansasi, e um (14,28%) por micobactéria pertencente ao Complexo M. tuberculosis. Exames bacteriológicos para outras bactérias e/ou fungos isolaram Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis em quatro (7,01%) dos 57 animais abatidos. Houve isolamento simultâneo de micobactérias e de Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis em dois (3,5%) dos 57 animais abatidos. Os exames histopatológicos apontaram em nove (15,78%) animais a presença de granuloma e coloração de Ziehl-Neelsen positivo. A análise dos resultados obtidos permitiram concluir que, neste trabalho, os testes imunoalérgicos (Teste Cervical Simples e Teste Cervical Comparativo) não foram capazes de diferenciar infecção provocada pelo M. flavescens 1, M. kansasi, complexo M. tuberculosis e C. pseudotuberculosis.

229658,Secondary Attack Rate of COVID-19 in household contacts: Systematic review,2020,"The COVID19 pandemic globally and significantly has affected the life and health of many communities. The early detection of infected patients is effective in fighting COVID19. Using radiology (X-Ray) images is, perhaps, the fastest way to diagnose the patients. Thereby, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be considered as applicable tools to diagnose COVID19 positive cases. Due to the complicated architecture of a deep CNN, its real-time training and testing become a challenging problem. This paper proposes using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) instead of the last fully connected layer to address this deficiency. However, the parameters' stochastic tuning of ELM's supervised section causes the final model unreliability. Therefore, to cope with this problem and maintain network reliability, the sine-cosine algorithm was utilized to tune the ELM's parameters. The designed network is then benchmarked on the COVID-Xray-5k dataset, and the results are verified by a comparative study with canonical deep CNN, ELM optimized by cuckoo search, ELM optimized by genetic algorithm, and ELM optimized by whale optimization algorithm. The proposed approach outperforms comparative benchmarks with a final accuracy of 98.83% on the COVID-Xray-5k dataset, leading to a relative error reduction of 2.33% compared to a canonical deep CNN. Even more critical, the designed network's training time is only 0.9421 ms and the overall detection test time for 3100 images is 2.721 s.","Wu, Chao; Khishe, Mohammad; Mohammadi, Mokhtar; Taher Karim, Sarkhel H; Rashid, Tarik A",Soft comput,,478

However, the current detection technologies are far from ideal. A lack of timely and accessible testing for identifying cases and close contacts has allowed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of the ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, to spread uncontrollably. The slow and expensive detection of mutations-predictors for chronic diseases such as cancer-form a barrier to personalized treatment. A recently developed diagnostic assay is ideal and field-ready-it relies on CRISPR-Cas13. CRISPR-Cas13 works similarly to other CRISPR systems: Cas13 is guided by a crRNA to cleave next to a specific RNA target sequence. Additionally, Cas13 boasts a unique collateral cleavage activity; collateral cleavage of a fluorescent reporter detects the presence of the target sequence in sample RNA. This system forms the basis of CRISPR-Cas13 diagnostic assays. CRISPR-Cas13 assays have >95% sensitivity and >99% specificity. Detection is rapid (<2 h), inexpensive ($0.05 per test), and portable-a test using lateral flow strips is akin to a pregnancy test. The recent adaptation of micro-well chips facilitates high-level multiplexing and is high-throughput. In this review, we cover the development of CRISPR-Cas13 assays for medical diagnosis, discuss the advantages of CRISPR-Cas13-based diagnosis over the traditional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and present examples of detection from real patient samples.","Shihong Gao, David; Zhu, Xiaodong; Lu, Binfeng",J. med. virol,,478

Health care services delivery is being compromised due to the surge in the number of infected patients during this pandemic. Aims: This study aimed to assess the risk factors associated with poor prognosis among COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia. Methods: This was a multi-centre retrospective cohort study that included all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases with definitive outcomes in Saudi Arabia during March 2020. Demographic, clinical history, comorbidity and outcomes data were retrieved from the National Health Electronic Surveillance Network (HESN) database. We used logistic regression models to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) to explore risk factors for critical outcomes (intensive care unit admission or death) among COVID-19 cases. Results: We included 648 COVID-19-positive patients with a median age of 34 years. Of these, 11.9% were in the critical group. Risk factors associated with worse outcomes included males (OR=1.92), age >60 years (OR=3.65), cardiac diseases (OR=3.05), chronic respiratory diseases (OR=2.29), and cases with two or more comorbidities (OR=2.57) after adjusting for age and sex; all had significant P-values <0.05. Conclusions: Independent risk factors for critical outcomes among COVID-19 cases include old age, males, cardiac patients, chronic respiratory diseases, and the presence of two or more comorbidities. We recommend designing a unique multi-item scale system to prognosticate COVID-19 patients.","Khan, Anas; Althunayyan, Saqer; Alsofayan, Yousef; Alotaibi, Raied; Mubarak, Abdullah; Arafat, Mohammed; Assiri, Abdullah; Jokhdar, Hani",East Mediterr Health J,,478

231060,Chemokine-Expressing Th1 and Treg Cells are Increased in the Lung of Patients with COVID-19,2020,"Recently, sound-based COVID-19 detection studies have shown great promise to achieve scalable and prompt digital pre-screening. However, there are still two unsolved issues hindering the practice. First, collected datasets for model training are often imbalanced, with a considerably smaller proportion of users tested positive, making it harder to learn representative and robust features. Second, deep learning models are generally overconfident in their predictions. Clinically, false predictions aggravate healthcare costs. Estimation of the uncertainty of screening would aid this. To handle these issues, we propose an ensemble framework where multiple deep learning models for sound-based COVID-19 detection are developed from different but balanced subsets from original data. As such, data are utilized more effectively compared to traditional up-sampling and down-sampling approaches: an AUC of 0.74 with a sensitivity of 0.68 and a specificity of 0.69 is achieved. Simultaneously, we estimate uncertainty from the disagreement across multiple models. It is shown that false predictions often yield higher uncertainty, enabling us to suggest the users with certainty higher than a threshold to repeat the audio test on their phones or to take clinical tests if digital diagnosis still fails. This study paves the way for a more robust sound-based COVID-19 automated screening system.","Xia, Tong; Han, Jing; Qendro, Lorena; Dang, Ting; Mascolo, Cecilia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02005v2.pdf,478

Results of the observational studies published during this pandemic have been conflicting. In this context, we conducted a multi-center, parallel group, randomized controlled feasibility study on awake prone positioning in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen. METHODS: 60 patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia requiring 4 or more liters of oxygen to maintain a saturation of &#8805;92% were recruited in this study. Thirty patients each were randomized to either standard care or awake prone group. Patients randomized to the prone group were encouraged to self-prone for at least 6 hours a day. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients adhering to the protocol in each group. RESULTS: In the prone group, 43% (13 out of 30) of patients were able to self-prone for 6 or more hours a day. In the supine group, 47% (14 out of 30) were completely supine and 53% spent some hours in the prone position, but none exceeded 6 hours. There was no significant difference in any of the secondary outcomes between the 2 groups and there were no adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Awake prone positioning in non-intubated patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure is feasible and safe under clinical trial conditions. The results of our feasibility study will potentially help in the design of larger definitive trials to address this key knowledge gap.","Jayakumar, Devachandran; Ramachandran Dnb, Pratheema; Rabindrarajan Dnb, Ebenezer; Vijayaraghavan Md, Bharath Kumar Tirupakuzhi; Ramakrishnan Ab, Nagarajan; Venkataraman Ab, Ramesh",J Intensive Care Med,,478

Meanwhile, most countries apply social distancing with the objective to keep the number of critical cases below the capabilities of the health care system. Due to the novelty and rapid spread of the virus, an a priori assessment of this strategy was not possible. In this study, we present a model-based systems analysis to assess the effectiveness of social distancing measures in terms of intensity and duration of application. Results show a super-linear scaling between intensity (percent contact reduction) and required duration of application to have an added value (a lower number of fatalities). This holds true for an effective reproduction of [Formula: see text] and is reverted for [Formula: see text].

233856,Stroke etiologies in patients with COVID-19: the svin COVID-19 multinational registry,2021,"Background: Healthcare Workers may stigmatize and discriminate against Men who have Sex with Men in East Africa. Objective: To understand the predictors of abuse and discrimination of sexual minority men in healthcare settings by Healthcare workers in seven cities in Tanzania. Method: In total, 300 sexual minority men over the age of 18 were interviewed in 7 Tanzanian cities by trained local interviewers. Abuse from others (physical, verbal, sexual, discrimination/humiliation), and abuse from Healthcare workers, was ascertained. Gender role mannerisms were self-rated by the respondent, and at the end of the interview, by the interviewer, on a Likert scale from very feminine to very masculine. Respondents also indicated whether they had revealed their homosexual behavior or had it exposed in the health consultation. Results: Median age was 27. Verbal abuse and community discrimination were the most commonly reported forms of abuse. Eighty-four percent had visited a healthcare center with a sexually related complaint (usually a sexually transmitted infection); of these, 24% reported abuse or discrimination from from a healthcare worker. Correlation between self-rated gender role mannerisms and interviewer-rated was r = 0.84. Regression analysis indicated that the degree of perceived gender role nonconformity was the major and significant predictor from Healthcare worker abuse: confirmation of homosexual behavior was non-significant. Gender role nonconformity predicted 21% of the variance in health worker abuse. Conclusion: There is speculation that abuse of sexual minority men by Healthcare workers in public clinics is due to factors in addition to their sexual behavior as gay/bisexual, and that it is due to violating perceived gender roles. Data confirm that perceived feminine gender role is a significant predictor, of abuse in healthcare and other settings. Common confusion between homosexual behavior and gender role norms may trigger discrimination, which may be as much due to violation of perceived gender roles as having sex with other men.","Ross, Michael W; Kashiha, John; Mgopa, Lucy R",Glob Health Action,,478

We calculated basic reproduction number (R0) and the time-varying estimate of the effective reproductive number (Rt) of COVID-19 by using the maximum likelihood method and the sequential Bayesian method, respectively. European and North American countries possessed higher R0 and unsteady Rt fluctuations, whereas some heavily affected Asian countries showed relatively low R0 and declining Rt now. The numbers of patients in Africa and Latin America are still low, but the potential risk of huge outbreaks cannot be ignored. Three scenarios were then simulated, generating distinct outcomes by using SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed) model. First, evidence-based prompt responses yield lower transmission rate followed by decreasing Rt. Second, implementation of effective control policies at a relatively late stage, in spite of huge casualties at early phase, can still achieve containment and mitigation. Third, wisely taking advantage of the time-window for developing countries in Africa and Latin America to adopt adequate measures can save more people's life.

We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients transported by the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and to investigate the surge capacity of and operational implications for the RFDS in dealing with COVID-19. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study. To determine the characteristics of patients transported for confirmed or suspected COVID-19, we included patient data from February 2, 2020, to May 6, 2020. To investigate the surge capacity and operational implications for the RFDS in dealing with COVID-19, we built and validated an interactive operations area-level discrete event simulation decision support model underpinned by RFDS air medical activity data from 2015 to 2019 (4 years). This model was subsequently used in a factorial in silico experiment to systematically investigate both the supply of RFDS air medical services and the increased rates of demand for these services for diseases of the respiratory system. Results: The RFDS conducted 291 patient episodes of care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19. This included 288 separate patients, including 136 men and 119 women (sex missingâ¯=â¯33), with a median age of 62.0 years (interquartile range, 43.5-74.9 years). The simulation decision support model we developed is capable of providing dynamic and real-time support for RFDS decision makers in understanding the system's performance under uncertain COVID-19 demand. With increased COVID-19-related demand, the ability of the RFDS to cope will be driven by the number of aircraft available. The simulation model provided each aviation section with estimated numbers of aircraft required to meet a range of anticipated demands. Conclusion: Despite the lack of certainty in the actual level of COVID-19-related demand for RFDS services, modeling demonstrates that the robustness of meeting such demand increases with the number of operational and medically staffed aircraft.","Gardiner, Fergus W; Johns, Hannah; Bishop, Lara; Churilov, Leonid",Air Med J,,478

There is less emphasis on the hand hygiene of hospitalised patients; in the context of COVID-19 mechanisms to support it are particularly important. The purpose of this study was to establish if providing patient hand wipes, and a defined protocol for encouraging their use, was effective in improving the frequency of patient hand hygiene (PHH). DESIGN: Before and after study SETTING: General Hospital, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients admitted to six acute elderly care/rehabilitation hospital wards between July and October 2018. METHODS: Baseline audit of PHH opportunities conducted over 6 weeks. Focus group with staff and survey of the public informed the development of a PHH bundle. Effect of bundle on PHH monitored by structured observation of HH opportunities over 12 weeks. RESULTS: During baseline 303 opportunities for PHH were observed; compliance with PHH was 13.2% (40/303; 95%CI 9.9-7.5). In the evaluation of PHH bundle 526 PHH opportunities were observed with HH occurring in 58.9% (310/526); an increase of 45.7% vs. baseline (95%CI 39.7-51.0%; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Providing patients with multi-wipe packs of handwipes is a simple, cost-effective approach to increasing patient hand hygiene and reducing the risk of HCAI in hospital.

Far from being an obsolete chapter we will revise the IgY-technology as a new frontier for research and clinic. A wide range of IgY applications has been effectively confirmed in both human and animal health. The molecular particularities of IgY give them functional advantages recommending them as good candidates in this endeavor. Obtaining specific IgY is sustained by reliable and nature friendly methodology as an alternative for mammalian antibodies. The aria of application is continuously enlarging from bacterial and viral infections to tumor biology. Specific anti-viral IgY were previously tested in several designs, thus its worth pointing out that in the actual COVID-19 pandemic context, respiratory infections need an enlarged arsenal of therapeutic approaches and clearly the roles of IgY should be exploited in depth.","Constantin, Carolina; Neagu, Monica; Supeanu, Teodora Diana; Chiurciu, Viorica; Spandidos, Demetrios A.",Exp.

Many factors are involved, and though impressive strides have been made in studying this novel disease in a very short time, there is still a great deal that is unknown about how the virus functions. Clinical data has been crucial for providing information on COVID-19 progression and determining risk factors. However, the mechanisms leading to the multi-tissue pathology are yet to be fully established. Although insights from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV have been valuable, it is clear that SARS-CoV-2 is different and merits its own extensive studies. In this review, we highlight unresolved questions surrounding this virus including the temporal immune dynamics, infection of non-pulmonary tissue, early life exposure, and the role of circadian rhythms. Risk factors such as sex and exposure to pollutants are also explored followed by a discussion of ways in which bioengineering approaches can be employed to help understand COVID-19. The use of sophisticated in vitro models can be employed to interrogate intercellular interactions and also to tease apart effects of the virus itself from the resulting immune response. Additionally, spatiotemporal information can be gleaned from these models to learn more about the dynamics of the virus and COVID-19 progression. Application of advanced tissue and organ system models into COVID-19 research can result in more nuanced insight into the mechanisms underlying this condition and elucidate strategies to combat its effects.","Shirazi, Jasmine; Donzanti, Michael J; Nelson, Katherine M; Zurakowski, Ryan; Fromen, Catherine A; Gleghorn, Jason P",Cell Mol Bioeng,,478
240341,WITHDRAWN: Covid-19: Round and oval areas of ground-glass opacity,2020,"The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) firstly considered as a cardiovascular circulating hormonal system, it is now accepted as a local tissue system that works synergistically or independently with the circulating one. Evidence states that tissue RAAS locally generates mediators with regulatory homeostatic functions, thus contributing, at some extent, to organ dysfunction or disease. Specifically, RAAS can be divided into the traditional RAAS pathway (or classic RAAS) mediated by angiotensin II (AII), and the non-classic RAAS pathway mediated by angiotensin 1-7. Both pathways operate in the heart and lung. In the heart, the classic RAAS plays a role in both hemodynamics and tissue remodeling associated with cardiomyocyte and endothelial dysfunction, leading to progressive functional impairment. Moreover, the local classic RAAS may predispose the onset of atrial fibrillation through different biological mechanisms involving inflammation, accumulation of epicardial adipose tissue, and electrical cardiac remodeling. In the lung, the classic RAAS regulates cell proliferation, immune-inflammatory response, hypoxia, and angiogenesis, contributing to lung injury and different pulmonary diseases (including COVID-19). Instead, the local non-classic RAAS counteracts the classic RAAS effects exerting a protective action on both heart and lung. Moreover, the non-classic RAAS, through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), mediates the entry of the etiological agent of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) into cells. This may cause a reduction in ACE2 and an imbalance between angiotensins in favor of AII that may be responsible for the lung and heart damage. Drugs blocking the classic RAAS (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) are well known to exert a cardiovascular benefit. They are recently under evaluation for COVID-19 for their ability to block AII-induced lung injury altogether with drugs stimulating the non-classic RAAS. Herein, we discuss the available evidence on the role of RAAS in the heart and lung, summarizing all clinical data related to the use of drugs acting either by blocking the classic RAAS or stimulating the non-classic RAAS.","Mascolo, A.; Scavone, C.; Rafaniello, C.; De Angelis, A.; Urbanek, K.; di Mauro, G.; Cappetta, D.; Berrino, L.; Rossi, F.; Capuano, A.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,,478

To analyze the association between the perceived care demand in the emergency call center of Castilla La Mancha (and hospital and ICU admissions for COVID-19, as well as their temporal characteristics, to explore its potential capacity as a predictive tool for COVID hospital admissions. Methodology. Retrospective observational study on the daily calls made to the emergency call center of Castilla La Mancha, both calls to 112 and those made to COVID line, in the period between March 1 and October 14, 2020. The data were analyzed by codes “diarrhea”, “dyspnea”, “fever” and “general discomfort” that were used as predictor variables, and their relationship with hospital admissions and ICU admissions. Results. A total of 831,943 calls were received at the CLM emergency call center through 112, with a maximum on March 13, 2020 with 10,582 calls. On COVID line, a total of 208,803 calls were received in that period, with a maximum on March 15 with 23,744. A statistically significant relationship was found between the regulation codes studied (specific symptoms) and the number of calls with hospital admissions and ICU admissions, with a predictive capacity of 2 weeks in relation to occupancy peaks. The codes with the greatest relationship were “general malaise” and “diarrhea”. Conclusion. We have found an association between the number of calls to a CCUE due to dyspnea, fever, general discomfort, diarrhea and the number of calls with hospital admissions and ICU for COVID-SARS-2 2 weeks in advance, mainly due to general discomfort and diarrhea. The design of predictive expert systems and their automation using artificial intelligence could be part of the preparation, planning and anticipation programs of health systems in the near future in the event of future pandemics..","Delgado, R.

Short communication,2020,"Background: The Hospital das Clínicas - University of Sao Paulo Medical School (HCFMUSP) is the largest university hospital complex in Brazil. HCFMUSP has been converted into a reference center for coronavirus disease 2019. The Division of Plastic Surgery postponed non-essential surgeries and outpatient consultations, accomplishing new guidelines (ANG) of national and international organizations. Even with these challenges arising from the pandemic, alternatives were considered to maintain institutional characteristics. This study aims to analyze this new scenario and the impact on patients' assistance and Plastic Surgery residents training. Methods: Total number of surgeries, type of procedures, and outpatient consultations in 2020, before (pre-ANG) and after (post-ANG) ANG, were compared with the same period in 2019 (2019-pre and 2020-post). Results: A marked reduction in the total number of surgeries and outpatient consultations was observed in the post-ANG period. In the post-ANG period, 267 operations were performed (26.7 ± 20.3/week), while in the 2019-post period, 1036 surgeries were performed (103.6 ± 9.7/week) (p = 0.0002). Similarly, 1571 consultations were conducted in the post-ANG period (157.1 ± 93.6/week), while in the 2019-post period, 3907 were performed (390.7 ± 43.1/week) (p = 0.0003). However, in the post-ANG period, an increase in the proportion of reconstructive compared with aesthetic surgery was observed. The maintenance of highly complex procedures such as microsurgical transplants was also identified. Conclusions: The predominant profile of reconstructive surgeries at the Division of Plastic Surgery allowed the continuity of procedures at all technical complexity levels, patient care maintenance, and Plastic Surgery residents training.Level of evidence: not ratable.","Pagotto, Vitor Penteado Figueiredo; Abbas, Laielly; Goldenberg, Dov Charles; Lobato, Rodolfo Costa; do Nascimento, Bruno Baptista; Monteiro, Gustavo Gomes Ribeiro; Camargo, Cristina Pires; de Freitas Busnardo, Fabio; Gemperli, Rolf",Eur J Plast Surg,,478

METHODS: Retrospective observational study performed in four university affiliated hospitals in Paris. AKI was defined according to the KIDGO guidelines. Factors associated with AKI were picked up using multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression. Independent risk factors of day 28 mortality were assessed using Cox model. RESULTS: 379 patients (median age 62 [53,69], 77% of male) were included. Half of the patients had AKI (n = 195, 52%) including 58 patients (15%) with AKI stage 1, 44 patients (12%) with AKI stage 2, and 93 patients (25% with AKI stage 3). Chronic kidney disease (OR 7.41; 95% CI 2.98-18.4), need for invasive mechanical ventilation at day 1 (OR 4.83; 95% CI 2.26-10.3), need for vasopressors at day 1 (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.05-4.21) were associated with increased risk of AKI. Day 28 mortality in the cohort was 26.4% and was higher in patients with AKI (37.4 vs. 14.7%, P < 0.001). Neither AKI (HR 1.35; 95% CI 0.78-2.32) nor AKI stage were associated with mortality (HR [95% CI] for stage 1, 2 and 3 when compared to no AKI of, respectively, 1.02 [0.49-2.10], 1.73 [0.81-3.68] and 1.42 [0.78-2.58]). CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of SARS-CoV2-related pneumonia patients admitted to the ICU, AKI was frequent, mostly driven by preexisting chronic kidney disease and life sustaining therapies, with unclear adjusted relationship with day 28 outcome.","Geri, Guillaume; Darmon, Michael; Zafrani, Lara; Fartoukh, Muriel; Voiriot, Guillaume; Le Marec, Julien; Nemlaghi, Saafa; Vieillard-Baron, Antoine; Azoulay, Elie",Ann Intensive Care,,478

This survey study reports on the experiences of 141 therapists who transitioned to providing video therapy during the pandemic. Aspects of the therapeutic relationship (e.g. working alliance, real relationship), experienced anxiety and professional self-doubt, attitudes towards and intention of video therapy use in the future were assessed. Although therapists reported some anxiety and self-doubt, most felt that online sessions had a sufficient working alliance and a strong real relationship. Therapists with more online therapy experience, lower levels of self-doubt and anxiety, and those who experienced a strong online real relationship during the pandemic, or thought their patients viewed it positively, tended to be more accepting of video therapy. Therapists were largely undecided as to whether they planned to use video therapy in the future; however, those with prior video therapy experience were more likely to endorse future utilization. Training is needed, especially for therapists with less online therapy experience, in order to foster a better experience and to support effective use of online therapy in the future.","Aafjes-van Doorn, Katie; Békés, Vera; Prout, Tracy A.",Couns.

DESIGN: An online questionnaire survey. METHODS: The self-designed questionnaire was distributed among residents online in February 2020. Descriptive statistics, two independent samples t-tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson's correlation analysis, multivariate linear regression and content analysis were performed. RESULTS: A total of 919 valid questionnaires were collected. The scoring rates of residents' knowledge, attitude and practice were 85.2%, 92.9% and 84.4%, respectively. Main factors influencing residents' knowledge included gender and occupation; while those influencing attitude were occupation, family economic level and knowledge; and those influencing practice included place of residence, occupation, with or without chronic disease, knowledge and attitude. Mass media was the primary approach for people to learn the knowledge and information of COVID-19. Difficulties or challenges faced were mainly lack of protective equipments, concerns about the risk of prevention and control, impact on daily life, work and study, lack of knowledge and consensus, psychological problems and information problems. CONCLUSION: The attitude of residents towards COVID-19 prevention and control is generally positive. The knowledge and practice have been popularized to a certain extent, but there are still deviations or deficiencies in residents' understanding of certain important knowledge and the adoption of relevant preventive measures.

Although some of the studies were conducted in Bangladesh, none of these studies considered the geographical distribution of knowledge and preventive behaviors towards COVID-19. Therefore, the present nationwide cross-sectional study with 10,067 samples for the first-time aims to assess the knowledge gap by presenting the geographical distribution of the COVID-19 knowledge and preventive behaviors across all administrative districts of Bangladesh. The measures included socio-demographics and questions about knowledge and preventive behaviors related to COVID-19. One-way ANOVA, independent t-test, and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the data. In addition, GIS-based mapping identified district-wise distribution of the outcomes. Results indicated that the overall mean score of knowledge related to COVID-19 was 14.363 ± 3.073, whereas 16.95 ± 2.89 was for preventive behaviors. Participants' being male, being divorced or widowed, consuming alcohol, smoking cigarettes, living in villages, and having no formal education reported lower performing preventive COVID-19 behaviors. Those participants with higher knowledge scores reported higher preventive COVID-19 behaviors (ß = 0.053, p<0.001). However, the model predicted only 13.2% of the variation in preventive COVID-19 behaviors while the overall model being significant. The findings suggest that the Bangladeshi government should initiate appropriate far-reaching program of health education focusing on knowledge and preventive behaviors towards COVID-19 at a community level. After all, the strategies to combat COVID-19 will require individuals' involvement to control and prevent the disease outbreak, for which education is essential.","Hosen, Ismail; Pakpour, Amir H; Sakib, Najmuj; Hussain, Nur; Al Mamun, Firoj; Mamun, Mohammed A",PLoS One,,478

249722,COVID-19 patients with progressive and non-progressive CT manifestations,2020,"Polyanions are negatively charged macromolecules known for several decades as inhibitors of many viruses in vitro, notably AIDS virus. In the case of enveloped viruses, this activity was assigned to the formation of a polyelectrolyte complex between an anionic species, the polyanion, and the spike cationic proteins which are, for polymer chemists, comparable to cationic polyelectrolytes. Unfortunately, in vitro antiviral activity was not confirmed in vivo, possibly because polyanions were captured by cationic blood elements before reaching target cells. Accordingly, virologists abandoned the use of polyanions for antiviral therapy. In the case of coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants the game may not be over because these viruses infect cells of airways and not of blood. This communication proposes strategies to use polysulfates to attack and inhibit viral particles before they reach target cells in the airways. For this, polysulfate solutions may be administered by spray, gargling and nebulization or used to capture virus-containing droplets and aerosols by bubbling when these vectors are in the atmosphere. The technical means exist. However, biocompatibility and biofunctionality tests are necessary in the case of airways. Such tests require manipulation of pathogens, something which is beyond the competences of a biomaterialist. For this, a specialist in virology is necessary. Attempts to find one failed so far despite all-around solicitations over the past ten months and despite the fact that attacking the virus with polysulfates may complement beneficially the defensive strategies based on masks, vaccines and hospitals.","Vert, Michel",J Biomater Sci Polym Ed,,478
250178,COVID-19 pneumonia: a tailor-made dress for a Down syndrome patient,2021,"Introduction Emerging research and clinical evidence suggest that severe COVID-19 is a microvascular disease, where SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a rapid inflammatory vascular response that leads to endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis. Underlying medical conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension, have been associated with increased risk for severe illness. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by surface spike protein binding to host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Isolated S protein of SARS-CoV-1 has been shown to induce an innate immune response. Here we investigate the cytokine response of monocytes with and without comorbidities (obesity and hypertension) exposed to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and the effects of this response on endothelial barrier function. Methods Human CD14+ monocytes (Lonza, Precision for Medicine) from two Caucasian males in their 50s, one with obesity and hypertension (HTN) and one without, were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/mL [positive control]), recombinant spike receptor-binding domain (RBD, 10 ug/mL) or serum-free media (negative control) for 48 hours. Monocyte conditioned media (MCM) was collected and cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4) were analyzed by multiplex ELISA. Human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) from a healthy donor were exposed to MCM from healthy or HTN subjects. Endothelial barrier function was measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). Briefly, HLMVECs were seeded on ECIS chambers to proliferate until impedance plateaued. Half of the media was then replaced with MCM. Differences in impedance drops were compared among various conditions. Western blotting was used to investigate Spike RBD internalization. Results Spike RBD and resulted in increased IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, and TNF-alpha compared to negative control (Fig1A). Monocytes from HTN subject showed increased secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12p70 compared to those from the healthy subject (Fig 1B). HLMVECs showed moderate long-term barrier disruption, when treated with Spike RBD alone and Spike RBD with MCM from healthy subjects and no difference in transient barrier disruption or recovery. HLMVECs exposed to MCM from HTN subjects showed increased long-term barrier dysfunction, especially with Spike RBD present, and recovery of barrier function was also hampered (Fig 2). Spike RBD was observed to be internalized by both monocytes and HLMVECs. Discussion Spike RBD alone induces inflammatory cytokine secretion by CD14+ monocytes and is further increased in monocytes from the obese/HTN subject. Exposure to Spike RBD and MCM from both healthy and HTN subjects caused significant long-term endothelial barrier dysfunction in HLMVECs with increased dysfunction seen for the obese/HTN MCM. These results are consistent with clinical experience with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, increased disease severity, and worse outcome in COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. Further work is being done to characterize the cytokine profile and mechanisms of barrier dysfunction.","Wang, Huilei Dante Siddhartha Nandakumar Kavitha Khoury Elizabeth Tucker Elizabeth Steppan Jochen Kannan Sujatha Santhanam Lakshmi",The FASEB Journal,,478

Although a global phenomenon, there is the need to react locally with swift and informed actions, as some of the essential plans are highly dependent on factors such as culture, geography, laws, and customs. This paper presents our approach to mapping the geospatial spread of COVID-19 in Mexico at the state and municipal level, the highest allowed possible resolution in the publicly available dataset provided by the Health Ministry. To visualize the magnitude of the infection, we offer a map for the confirmed positive, pending, and deceases cases, while to support mobility, we provide a geospatial visualization of $R_t$, the basic reproduction number. This document describes the structure of the dataset, the software tools employed, and a description of the functionality of the maps, which definition we make publicly available.","Pulido, Dagoberto; Basurto, Daniela; C'andido, Mayra; Salas, Joaq'in",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07784v1.pdf,478

This includes host inflammatory and cytokine responses to COVID-19 caused by the SARS-2 coronavirus (SARS CoV2). From studies conducted in laboratory animals, there are additional concerns about immune enhancement and the role of potential host immunopathology resulting from experimental human COVID-19 vaccines. Here we summarize evidence suggesting there may be partial overlap between the underlying immunopathologic processes linked to both coronavirus infection and vaccination, and a role for Th17 in immune enhancement and eosinophilic pulmonary immunopathology. Such findings help explain the link between viral-vectored coronavirus vaccines and immune enhancement and its reduction through alum adjuvants. Additional research may also clarify links between COVID-19 pulmonary immunopathology and heart disease.","Hotez, Peter J; Bottazzi, Maria Elena; Corry, David B",Microbes Infect,,478

Although most vaccine strategies have focused on systemic immunization, here we compared the protective efficacy of 2 adjuvanted subunit vaccines with spike protein S1: an intramuscularly primed/boosted vaccine and an intramuscularly primed/intranasally boosted mucosal vaccine in rhesus macaques. The intramuscular-alum-only vaccine induced robust binding and neutralizing antibody and persistent cellular immunity systemically and mucosally, whereas intranasal boosting with nanoparticles, including IL-15 and TLR agonists, elicited weaker T cell and Ab responses but higher dimeric IgA and IFN-&#945;. Nevertheless, following SARS-CoV-2 challenge, neither group showed detectable subgenomic RNA in upper or lower respiratory tracts versus naive controls, indicating full protection against viral replication. Although mucosal and systemic protective mechanisms may differ, results demonstrate both vaccines can protect against respiratory SARS-CoV-2 exposure. In summary, we have demonstrated that the mucosal vaccine was safe after multiple doses and cleared the input virus more efficiently in the nasal cavity and thus may act as a potent complementary reinforcing boost for conventional systemic vaccines to provide overall better protection.","Sui, Yongjun; Li, Jianping; Zhang, Roushu; Prabhu, Sunaina Kiran; Andersen, Hanne; Venzon, David; Cook, Anthony; Brown, Renita; Teow, Elyse; Velasco, Jason; Greenhouse, Jack; Putman-Taylor, Tammy; Campbell, Tracey-Ann; Pessaint, Laurent; Moore, Ian N; Lagenaur, Laurel; Talton, Jim; Breed, Matthew W; Kramer, Josh; Bock, Kevin W; Minai, Mahnaz; Nagata, Bianca M; Lewis, Mark G; Wang, Lai-Xi; Berzofsky, Jay A",JCI insight,,478

255208,Defogging Strategy for Protective Eye Goggles to Prevent Microorganism Transmission While Performing Neurosurgical Procedures,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence suggests young children are at greater risk of COVID-19 infection than initially predicted. However, a comprehensive understanding of epidemiology of COVID-19 infection in young children under five years, the most at-risk age-group for respiratory infections, remain unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in children under five years. METHOD: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses , we searched several electronic databases (Pubmed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus) with no language restriction for published epidemiological studies and case-reports reporting laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection in children under five years until June 4, 2020. We assessed pooled prevalence for key demographics and clinical characteristics using Freeman-Tukey double arcsine random-effects model for studies except case-reports. We evaluated risk of bias separately for case-reports and other studies. RESULTS: We identified 1,964 articles, of which, 65 articles were eligible for systematic review that represented 1,214 children younger than five years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. The pooled estimates showed that 50% young COVID-19 cases were infants (95% CI: 36% - 63%, 27 studies); 53% were male (95% CI: 41% - 65%, 24 studies); 43% were asymptomatic (95% CI: 15% - 73%, 9 studies) and 7% (95% CI: 0% - 30%, 5 studies) had severe disease that required intensive-care-unit admission. Of 139 newborns from COVID-19 infected mothers, five (3.6%) were COVID-19 positive. There was only one death recorded. DISCUSSION: This systematic review reports the largest number of children younger than five years with COVID-19 infection till date. Our meta-analysis shows nearly half of young COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic and half were infants, highlighting the need for ongoing surveillance to better understand the epidemiology, clinical pattern, and transmission of COVID-19 to develop effective preventive strategies against COVID-19 disease in young paediatric population.","Bhuiyan, Mejbah Uddin; Stiboy, Eunice; Hassan, Md Zakiul; Chan, Mei; Islam, Md Saiful; Haider, Najmul; Jaffe, Adam; Homaira, Nusrat",Vaccine,,478

259944,COVID-19 related mortality in post-operative cardiac surgical patients,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, including Pfizer/Biontech BNT162b2, were shown to be effective for COVID-19 prevention, eliciting both robust antibody responses in naive individuals and boosting pre-existing antibody levels in SARS-CoV-2-recovered individuals. However, the magnitude, repertoire, and phenotype of epitope-specific T cell responses to this vaccine, and the effect of vaccination on pre-existing T cell memory in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients, are still poorly understood. Thus, in this study we compared epitope-specific T cells elicited after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, and vaccination of both naive and recovered individuals. We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells before and after BNT162b2 vaccination and used pools of 18 DNA-barcoded MHC-class I multimers, combined with scRNAseq and scTCRseq, to characterize T cell responses to several immunodominant epitopes, including a spike-derived epitope cross-reactive to common cold coronaviruses. Comparing responses after infection or vaccination, we found that T cells responding to spike-derived epitopes show similar magnitudes of response, memory phenotypes, TCR repertoire diversity, and {beta}TCR sequence motifs, demonstrating the potency of this vaccination platform. Importantly, in COVID-19-recovered individuals receiving the vaccine, pre-existing spike-specific memory cells showed both clonal expansion and a phenotypic shift towards more differentiated CCR7-CD45RA+ effector cells. In-depth analysis of T cell receptor repertoires demonstrates that both vaccination and infection elicit largely identical repertoires as measured by dominant TCR motifs and receptor breadth, indicating that BNT162b2 vaccination largely recapitulates T cell generation by infection for all critical parameters. Thus, BNT162b2 vaccination elicits potent spike-specific T cell responses in naive individuals and also triggers the recall T cell response in previously infected individuals, further boosting spike-specific responses but altering their differentiation state. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of mRNA vaccines to induce, maintain, and shape T cell memory through vaccination and revaccination.","Minervina, Anastasia A; Pogorelyy, Mikhail V; Kirk, Allison M; Allen, Emma Kaitlynn; Allison, Kim J; Lin, Chung-Yang; Brice, David C; Zhu, Xun; Vegesana, Kasi; Wu, Gang; Crawford, Jeremy Chase; Schultz-Cherry, Stacey; Estepp, Jeremie H; McGargill, Maureen; Team, - the SJTRC Study; Wolf, Joshua; Thomas, Paul G",,,478
260214,"Authors' Reply to: ""COVID-19 in the IBD Population: The Need for Correct Nomenclature.""",2020,"OBJECTIVES: to describe and compare the effectiveness of national and local lockdowns in controlling the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: a rapid review of published and grey literature on COVID-19 pandemic was conducted following predefined eligibility criteria by searching electronic databases, repositories of pre-print articles, websites and databases of international health, and research related institutions and organisations. RESULTS: of 584 initially identified records up to 5 July 2020, 19 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Most of the studies (No. 11) used the reproduction number (Rt) as a measure of effect and in all of them areduction of the estimated value at post-intervention period was found. The implementation of lockdown in 11 European countries was associated with an average 82% reduction of Rt, ranging from a posterior Rt of 0.44 (95%CI 0.26-0.61) for Norway to a posterior Rt of 0.82 (95%CI 0.73- 0.93) for Belgium. Changes in infection rates and transmission rates were estimated in 8 studies. Daily changes in infection rates ranged from -0.6% (Sweden) to -11.3% (Hubei and Guangdong provinces). Additionally, other studies reported a change in the trend of hospitalizations (Italy, Spain) and positive effects on the doubling time of cases (Hubei, China) after lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: results of this rapid review suggest a positive effect of the containment measures on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, with a major effect in countries where lockdown started early and was more restrictive. Rigorous research is warranted to evaluate which approach is the most effective in each stage of the epidemic and in specific social contexts, in particular addressing if these approaches should be implemented on the whole population or target specific risk groups.","Caristia, Silvia; Ferranti, Margherita; Skrami, Edira; Raffetti, Elena; Pierannunzio, Daniela; Palladino, Raffeele; Carle, Flavia; Saracci, Rodolfo; Badaloni, Chiara; Barone-Adesi, Francesco; Belleudi, Valeria; Ancona, Carla",Epidemiol Prev,,478

We demonstrate that if each subpopulation is informed of its infection rate and reduces interactions accordingly, the fraction of the subpopulation infected can remain below half for all time instants. To this end, we first modify the basic SIS model by introducing a state dependent parameter representing the frequency of interactions between subpopulations. Thereafter, we show that for this modified SIS model, the spectral radius of a suitably-defined matrix being not greater than one causes all the agents, regardless of their initial sickness levels, to converge to the healthy state; assuming non-trivial disease spread, the spectral radius being greater than one leads to the existence of a unique endemic equilibrium, which is also asymptotically stable. Finally, by leveraging the aforementioned results, we show that the fraction of (sub)populations infected never exceeds half.","Wang, Yuan; Gracy, Sebin; Ishii, Hideaki; Johansson, Karl Henrik",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00122v2.pdf,478

Beware of the same storm that has a different origin",2020,"This paper studies the social acceptability and feasibility of a focused protection strategy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We propose a control scheme to develop herd immunity while satisfying the following two basic requirements for a viable policy option. The first requirement is social acceptability: the overall deaths should be minimized for social acceptance. The second is feasibility: the healthcare system should not be overwhelmed to avoid various adverse effects. To exploit the fact that the disease severity increases considerably with age and comorbidities, we assume that some focused protection measures for those high-risk individuals are implemented and the disease does not spread within the high-risk population. Because the protected population has higher severity ratios than the unprotected population by definition, the protective measure can substantially reduce mortality in the whole population and also avoid the collapse of the healthcare system. Based on a simple susceptible-infected-recovered model, social acceptability and feasibility of the proposed strategy are summarized into two easily computable conditions. The proposed framework can be applied to various populations for studying the viability of herd immunity strategies against COVID-19. For Japan, herd immunity may be developed by the proposed scheme if [Formula: see text] and the severity rates of the disease are 1/10 times smaller than the previously reported value, although as high mortality as seasonal influenza is expected.","Akamatsu, Takashi; Nagae, Takeshi; Osawa, Minoru; Satsukawa, Koki; Sakai, Takara; Mizutani, Daijiro",Sci Rep,,478

AKI is associated with high mortality rates in this setting, especially when renal replacement therapy is required. Several studies have highlighted changes in urinary sediment, including proteinuria and hematuria, and evidence of urinary SARS-CoV-2 excretion, suggesting the presence of a renal reservoir for the virus. The pathophysiology of COVID-19 associated AKI could be related to unspecific mechanisms but also to COVID-specific mechanisms such as direct cellular injury resulting from viral entry through the receptor (ACE2) which is highly expressed in the kidney, an imbalanced renin-angotensin-aldosteron system, pro-inflammatory cytokines elicited by the viral infection and thrombotic events. Non-specific mechanisms include haemodynamic alterations, right heart failure, high levels of PEEP in patients requiring mechanical ventilation, hypovolemia, administration of nephrotoxic drugs and nosocomial sepsis. To date, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 induced AKI. A number of investigational agents are being explored for antiviral/immunomodulatory treatment of COVID-19 and their impact on AKI is still unknown. Indications, timing and modalities of renal replacement therapy currently rely on non-specific data focusing on patients with sepsis. Further studies focusing on AKI in COVID-19 patients are urgently warranted in order to predict the risk of AKI, to identify the exact mechanisms of renal injury and to suggest targeted interventions.","Gabarre, Paul; Dumas, Guillaume; Dupont, Thibault; Darmon, Michael; Azoulay, Elie; Zafrani, Lara",Intensive Care Med,,478

Laboratory-based diagnostic tests utilized real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on throat samples. This study evaluated the diagnostic value to analyzing throat and sputum samples in order to improve accuracy and detection efficiency. Methods Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by the RT-PCR assay. Results The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using the RT-PCR assay (p = 0.001). Conclusions The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens were significantly higher than those from throat swabs. We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum.

There is a pressing need for institutions to present discipline-specific strategies for the management of COVID-19 patients. We present the comprehensive considerations at the National University Hospital, Singapore from the surgeon's and anesthetist's perspectives in the performance of spinal surgery in COVID-19 patients. These are based on national guidelines and overarching principles of protection for the healthcare workers (HCWs) and efficiency in surgical planning. The workflow begins with the emergency department screening that has been adapted to the local epidemiology of COVID-19 in order to identify suspected/confirmed cases. If patient history cannot be obtained, demographic, clinical, and imaging data are used. Designated orthopedic ""contaminated teams"" are available 24/7 with an activation time of <30 minutes for review. In cases where sub-specialty spine surgeons were required, these professionals were inducted into the ""contaminated team"" and quarantined until cleared to return to work. Indications for emergency spine surgery were determined pre-emptively. Preoperative surgical considerations included the minimization of manpower, limited dissection, reduced operative time, and judicious use of equipment, leading to reduced aerosolization. Anesthesia considerations include preoperative screening for COVID-19-related concerns that influence surgery, operating room process planning and induction, intraoperative, reversal, recovery, and resuscitation considerations. Focused multi-disciplinary preoperative briefing facilitates familiarization. Surgical, anesthetic, and postoperative workflows were designed to reduce the risk of transmission and protect HCWs while effectively performing spinal surgery. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated paradigm shifts in healthcare planning, hospital workflows, and operative protocols. The viral burden does not discriminate between surgeons and physicians, and it is crucial that we, as medical professionals, adapt practices to be malleable and fluid to address the ever-changing developments.","Barry, Tan Wei Loong; Jeanette, Tan Sze Lyn Jasmin; Ashokka, Balakrishnan; Lopez, Keith Gerard; Thambiah, Joseph; Kumar, Naresh",Asian Spine J,,478

Expression of two mucosa-specific serine proteases, TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4, facilitated SARS-CoV-2 spike fusogenic activity and promoted virus entry into host cells. We also demonstrate that viruses released into the intestinal lumen were inactivated by simulated human colonic fluid, and infectious virus was not recovered from the stool specimens of COVID-19 patients. Our results highlight the intestine as a potential site of SARS-CoV-2 replication, which may contribute to local and systemic illness and overall disease progression.","Zang, Ruochen; Gomez Castro, Maria Florencia; McCune, Broc T; Zeng, Qiru; Rothlauf, Paul W; Sonnek, Naomi M; Liu, Zhuoming; Brulois, Kevin F; Wang, Xin; Greenberg, Harry B; Diamond, Michael S; Ciorba, Matthew A; Whelan, Sean P J; Ding, Siyuan",Sci. immunol,,478

266957,Trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic: chasing a moving target,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced many education systems to consider alternative remote e-learning modalities, which have consequential behavioral and health implications for youth. In particular, increased e-learning engagement with digital screens and reduction in outdoor activities are two likely channels posing adverse risks for myopia development. This study investigated the association between e-learning screen use, outdoor activity, lighting condition, and myopia development among school-age children in China, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from 3405 school-age children attending primary, lower-secondary, and upper-secondary schools in China. Univariate parametric and nonparametric tests, and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used. Findings show that each diopter hour increase in daily e-learning screen use is significantly associated with progression of myopia symptoms (OR: 1.074, 95% CI: 1.058–1.089;p &lt;0.001), whereas engaging in outdoor exercise four to six times per week (OR: 0.745, 95% CI: 0.568–0.977;p = 0.034) and one to three times per week (OR: 0.829, 95% CI: 0.686–0.991;p = 0.048) is associated with a lower likelihood of myopia progression than none at all. In addition, we found that indoor lighting that is either “too dim” (OR: 1.686, 95% CI: 1.226–2.319;p = 0.001) or “too bright” (OR: 1.529, 95% CI: 1.007–2.366;p = 0.036) is significantly associated higher likelihood of myopic symptoms. Findings in this study uncover the less observable vision consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on youths through digital online learning and highlight the importance of considering appropriate mitigation strategies to deal with this emerging public health challenge.","Liu, Ji Li Baihuiyu Chen Qiaoyi Dang Jingxia",Healthcare,,478

267690,Antihypertensive medications and COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality: Population-based case-control analysis in the United Kingdom,2021,"BACKGROUND: Recent research and policy initiatives propose addressing the social determinants of health within clinical settings. One such strategy is the expansion of routine data collection on patient Race, Ethnicity, and Language (REAL) within electronic health records (EHRs). Although previous research has examined the general views of providers and patients on REAL data, few studies consider health care workers' perceptions of this data collection directly at the point of care, including how workers understand REAL data in relation to health equity. OBJECTIVE: This qualitative study examines a large integrated delivery system's implementation of REAL data collection, focusing on health care workers' understanding of REAL and its impact on data's integration within EHRs. RESULTS: Providers, staff, and administrators expressed apprehension over REAL data collection due to the following: (1) disagreement over data's significance, including the expected purpose of collecting REAL items; (2) perceived barriers to data retrieval, such as the lack of standardization across providers and national tensions over race and immigration; and (3) uncertainty regarding data's use (clinical decision making vs. system research) and dissemination (with whom the data may be shared; eg, public agencies, other providers, and insurers). CONCLUSION: Emerging racial disparities associated with COVID-19 highlight the high stakes of REAL data collection. However, numerous barriers to health equity remain. Health care workers need greater institutional support for REAL data and related EHR initiatives. Despite data collection's central importance to policy objectives of disparity reduction, data mandates alone may be insufficient for achieving health equity.","Cruz, Taylor M; Smith, Sheridan A",Med. care,,478

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus is called COVID-19, which is highly contagious and has an overall mortality rate of 6.35% as of May 26, 2020. There is no vaccine or antiviral available for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we report our discovery of inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Using the FRET-based enzymatic assay, several inhibitors including boceprevir, GC-376, and calpain inhibitors II, and XII were identified to have potent activity with single-digit to submicromolar IC50 values in the enzymatic assay. The mechanism of action of the hits was further characterized using enzyme kinetic studies, thermal shift binding assays, and native mass spectrometry. Significantly, four compounds (boceprevir, GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII) inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cell culture with EC50 values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37 µM. Notably, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII represent novel chemotypes that are distinct from known substrate-based peptidomimetic Mpro inhibitors. A complex crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with GC-376, determined at 2.15 Å resolution with three protomers per asymmetric unit, revealed two unique binding configurations, shedding light on the molecular interactions and protein conformational flexibility underlying substrate and inhibitor binding by Mpro. Overall, the compounds identified herein provide promising starting points for the further development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.","Ma, Chunlong; Sacco, Michael Dominic; Hurst, Brett; Townsend, Julia Alma; Hu, Yanmei; Szeto, Tommy; Zhang, Xiujun; Tarbet, Bart; Marty, Michael Thomas; Chen, Yu; Wang, Jun",Cell Res,,478

269475,The impact of COVID-19 in Dravet syndrome: A UK survey,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 has been emerged in December 2019 in China, causing deadly (5% mortality) pandemic pneumonia, termed COVID-19. More than one host-cell receptor is reported to be recognized by the viral spike protein, among them is the cell-surface Heat Shock Protein A5 (HSPA5), also termed GRP78 or BiP. Upon viral infection, HSPA5 is upregulated, then translocating to the cell membrane where it is subjected to be recognized by the SARS-CoV-2 spike. In this study, some natural product compounds are tested against the HSPA5 substrate-binding domain ß (SBDß), which reported to be the recognition site for the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations are used to test some natural compounds binding to HSPA5 SBDß. The results show high to a moderate binding affinity for the phytoestrogens (Diadiazin, Genistein, Formontein, and Biochanin A), chlorogenic acid, linolenic acid, palmitic acid, caffeic acid, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, hydroxytyrosol, cis-p-Coumaric acid, cinnamaldehyde, thymoquinone, and some physiological hormones such as estrogens, progesterone, testosterone, and cholesterol to the HSPA5 SBDß. Based on its binding affinities, the phytoestrogens and estrogens are the best in binding HSPA5, hence may interfere with SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the stressed cells. These compounds can be successful as anti-COVID-19 agents for people with a high risk of cell stress like elders, cancer patients, and front-line medical staff.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

In the last months some droplet and aerosol containment strategies have been circulating on the internet, however, until now there is no evidence in the literature to prove the effectiveness of such barriers. Thus, using a microbial dispersion model with the fast handpiece, the aim of this preliminary study was to compare the dispersion caused by the the dental drill (DD) alone or in association with an individual biosafety barrier (IDBD / DD), which consisted of a layer of PVC film combined to a layer of polypropylene mounted on a frame. The dental drill was activated for one minute having had the water from the reservoir been replaced with a suspension of Lactobacillus casei Shirota. Petri dishes containing MRS agar were positioned at 50, 100 and 150 cm from the headboard of the dental chair at different angles (90 and 0 degrees). At 50 cm, the mean (standard deviation) of L. casei Shirota for DD was 13,554.59 (493.48) CFU, while for IDBD / DD was 570.67 (60.54) CFU (p &lt;0.0001), establishing a 96% reduction. Considering these preliminary results, the individual biosafety barrier proved effective in reducing dispersion from the dental drill in this study model, which suggests that this barrier may be a viable option to optimize biosafety in the dental environment.","Montalli, Victor Angelo Martins; Garcez, Aguinaldo Silva; Montalli, Gabriel Angelo Martins; França, Fabiana Mantovani Gomes; Suzuki, Selly Sayuri; Mian, Letícia Marques Tondini; Motta, Rogério Heládio Lopes; Napimoga, Marcelo Henrique; Junqueira, José Luiz Cintra",RGO Rev.

Furthermore, the ROX index (ie, the ratio of [Formula: see text] to breathing frequency) has been validated to predict high-flow nasal cannula failure in subjects under spontaneous breathing. However, these indices have not been tested in subjects with COVID-19 receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. This study aims to verify the correlation between both the ROX index and [Formula: see text] with [Formula: see text] and the ratio of [Formula: see text] to breathing frequency, and to determine the accuracy of the indices that use [Formula: see text] for the prediction of extubation failure in subjects with COVID-19. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted from May 15, 2020, to June 15, 2020, with subjects with COVID-19 on invasive mechanical ventilation. Indices using [Formula: see text] in the formula were compared to those using [Formula: see text]. Additionally, the performance of the indices in predicting extubation failure was evaluated. RESULTS: This study included 69 subjects age 64.8 ± 14.6 y. There were no differences between the median values of the indices, including between the ROX index and [Formula: see text] to breathing frequency (P = .40) or between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] (P = .83). When comparing the ROX index with the [Formula: see text] index to breathing frequency, they were found to be strongly correlated (R2 = 0.75 [95% CI 0.6763-0.8152], P < .001). The comparison of [Formula: see text] with [Formula: see text] revealed R2 = 0.70 (95% CI 0.563-0.749, P < .001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the ROX index to determine extubation failure was 0.74 (P = .01), whereas for [Formula: see text] it was 0.78 (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The indices presented a good correlation in subjects with COVID-19 on invasive mechanical ventilation, and both the ROX index and [Formula: see text] can discriminate extubation failure in this population.","Andrade Filho, Pedro H de; Brasil, Eduardo S de Assis; Costa, Ladyer G; M Sousa, Daniel Escóssia; Pereira, Talison S; Silva, João Manoel",Respir Care,,478

We highlight the SARS-CoV-2 human-animal interfaces and elaborate containment strategies using the same vaccination (i.e., nanoparticle ""NP"" formulations of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines) for humans, minks, raccoon dogs, cats, and zoo animals. We investigate the toxicity issues of anti-CoV NPs (i.e., plasmonic NPs and quantum dots) on different levels. Namely, nano-bio interfaces (i.e., protein corona), in vitro (i.e., lung cells) and in vivo (i.e., zebrafish embryos) assessments, and impacts on humans are discussed in a narrative supported by original figures. Ultimately, we express our skeptical opinion on the comprehensive administration of such antiviral nanotheranostics, even when integrated into facemasks, because of their reported toxicities and the different NP parameters (e.g., size, shape, surface charge, and purity and chemical composition of NPs) that govern their end toxicity. We believe that more toxicity studies should be performed and be presented, clarifying the odds of the safe administration of nanotoxocological solutions and the relief of a worried public.","Mosselhy, Dina A; Virtanen, Jenni; Kant, Ravi; He, Wei; Elbahri, Mady; Sironen, Tarja",,,478

272567,Predictors of Worse Prognosis in Young and Middle-Aged Adults Hospitalized with COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Multi-Center Italian Study (COVID-UNDER50),2021,"BACKGROUND: Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is a form of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for diarrhoea that has the potential to drastically reduce child mortality; yet, according to UNICEF estimates, less than half of children younger than 5 years with diarrhoea in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) received ORS in 2016. A variety of recommended home fluids (RHF) exist as alternative forms of ORT; however, it is unclear whether RHF prevent child mortality. Previous studies have shown considerable variation between countries in ORS and RHF use, but subnational variation is unknown. This study aims to produce high-resolution geospatial estimates of relative and absolute coverage of ORS, RHF, and ORT (use of either ORS or RHF) in LMICs. METHODS: We used a Bayesian geostatistical model including 15 spatial covariates and data from 385 household surveys across 94 LMICs to estimate annual proportions of children younger than 5 years of age with diarrhoea who received ORS or RHF (or both) on continuous continent-wide surfaces in 2000-17, and aggregated results to policy-relevant administrative units. Additionally, we analysed geographical inequality in coverage across administrative units and estimated the number of diarrhoeal deaths averted by increased coverage over the study period. Uncertainty in the mean coverage estimates was calculated by taking 250 draws from the posterior joint distribution of the model and creating uncertainty intervals (UIs) with the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of those 250 draws. FINDINGS: While ORS use among children with diarrhoea increased in some countries from 2000 to 2017, coverage remained below 50% in the majority (62·6%; 12â417 of 19â823) of second administrative-level units and an estimated 6â519â000 children (95% UI 5â254â000-7â733â000) with diarrhoea were not treated with any form of ORT in 2017. Increases in ORS use corresponded with declines in RHF in many locations, resulting in relatively constant overall ORT coverage from 2000 to 2017. Although ORS was uniformly distributed subnationally in some countries, within-country geographical inequalities persisted in others; 11 countries had at least a 50% difference in one of their units compared with the country mean. Increases in ORS use over time were correlated with declines in RHF use and in diarrhoeal mortality in many locations, and an estimated 52â230 diarrhoeal deaths (36â910-68â860) were averted by scaling up of ORS coverage between 2000 and 2017. Finally, we identified key subnational areas in Colombia, Nigeria, and Sudan as examples of where diarrhoeal mortality remains higher than average, while ORS coverage remains lower than average. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this study is the first to produce and map subnational estimates of ORS, RHF, and ORT coverage and attributable child diarrhoeal deaths across LMICs from 2000 to 2017, allowing for tracking progress over time. Our novel results, combined with detailed subnational estimates of diarrhoeal morbidity and mortality, can support subnational needs assessments aimed at furthering policy makers' understanding of within-country disparities. Over 50 years after the discovery that led to this simple, cheap, and life-saving therapy, large gains in reducing mortality could still be made by reducing geographical inequalities in ORS coverage.

272901,Survey on the impact of COVID19 in patients on immunosuppression for ocular and orbital inflammatory disorders,2021,"D614G genotype of SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly infectious and responsible for almost all infection for 2nd wave. However, there are currently no reports with D614G as vaccine candidate. Here we report the development of an mRNA-LNP vaccine with D614G variant and characterization in animal model. We have used special mRNA-architecture and formulation that provides suitable response of the product. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) data with spike protein (S) revealed that immunization generated specific antibody pools against the whole extracellular domain (RBD and S2) of the spike protein. The anti-sera and purified IgGs from immunized mice neutralized SARS-CoV-2-pseudoviruses in ACE2-expressing HEK293 cells in a dose dependent manner. Importantly, single-dose immunization protected mice-lungs from homotypic-pseudovirus entry and cytopathy. The immunologic responses have been implicated by a balanced and stable population of CD4+ cells with a Th1 bias. The data suggested great promise for immediate translation of the technology to the clinic.","Nag, Kakon; Chandra Baray, Juwel; Rahman Khan, Maksudur; Mahmud, Asif; Islam, Jikrul; Myti, Sanat; Ali, Rostum; Haq Sarker, Enamul; Kumar, Samir; Hossain Chowdhury, Mobarak; Roy, Rony; Islam, Faqrul; Barman, Uttam; Khan, Habiba; Chakraborty, Sourav; Badsha, Alam; Hossain, Manik; Ahammad, Shamim; Rahman Chowdhury, Mashfiqur; Ghosh, Polash; Islam Shimul, Rayhanul; Ahmmed, Ronzu; Hussain Bhuiya, Eleus; Kumar Biswas, Bipul; Mohiuddin, Mohammad; Sultana, Naznin",Vaccine,,478

We demonstrated a utility of using traditional contact tracing measures supplemented with symptom tracking and contact management system to assist public health workers with high efficiency. METHODS: A centralized contact tracing system was developed to support data linkage, cross-jurisdictional coordination, and follow-up of contacts' health status. We illustrated the process of how digital tools support contact tracing and management of COVID-19 cases and measured the timeliness from case detection to contact monitoring to evaluate system performance. RESULTS: Among the 8051 close contacts of the 487 confirmed cases (16.5 close contacts/case, 95% CI [13.9-19.1]), the median elapsed time from last exposure to quarantine was three days (IQR 1-5). By implementing the approach of self-reporting using automatic text-messages and web-app, the percentage of health status updates from self-reporting increased from 22.5% to 61.5%. The high proportion of secondary cases detected via contact tracing (88%) might reduce the R0 to under one and minimize the impact of local transmission in the community. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive contact tracing and management with complementary technology would still be a pillar of strategies for containing outbreaks during de-escalation or early in the next wave of COVID-19 pandemic.","Jian, Shu-Wan; Cheng, Hao-Yuan; Huang, Xiang-Ting; Liu, Ding-Ping",Int J Infect Dis,,478
273248,Chest imaging in patients with suspected COVID-19,2020,"An outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is a major public health disease as well as a challenging task to people with comorbidity worldwide. According to a report, comorbidity enhances the risk factors with complications of COVID-19. Here, we propose and explore a mathematical framework to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 with comorbidity. Within this framework, the model is calibrated by using new daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in India. The qualitative properties of the model and the stability of feasible equilibrium are studied. The model experiences the scenario of backward bifurcation by parameter regime accounting for progress in susceptibility to acquire infection by comorbidity individuals. The endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable if recruitment of comorbidity becomes higher without acquiring the infection. Moreover, a larger backward bifurcation regime indicates the possibility of more infection in susceptible individuals. A dynamics in the mean fluctuation of the force of infection is investigated with different parameter regimes. A significant correlation is established between the force of infection and corresponding Shannon entropy under the same parameters, which provides evidence that infection reaches a significant proportion of the susceptible.","Das, Parthasakha; Nadim, Sk Shahid; Das, Samhita; Das, Pritha",Nonlinear Dyn,,478

275111,Dengue amidst COVID-19 in India: The mystery of plummeting cases,2021,"OBJECTIVES: T1 mapping (T1-map) and cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) techniques have been introduced for the early detection of interstitial myocardial fibrosis and deformation abnormalities. We sought to demonstrate that T1-map and CMR-FT may identify the presence of subclinical myocardial structural changes in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP). METHODS: Consecutive MVP patients with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation and comparative matched healthy subjects were prospectively enrolled and underwent CMR-FT analysis to calculate 2D global and segmental circumferential (CS) and radial strain (RS) and T1-map to determine global and segmental native T1 (nT1) values. RESULTS: Seventy-three MVP patients (mean age, 57 ± 13 years old; male, 76%; regurgitant volume, 57 ± 21 mL) and 42 matched control subjects (mean age, 56 ± 18 years; male, 74%) were included. MVP patients showed a lower global CS (- 16.3 ± 3.4% vs. - 17.8 ± 1.9%, p = 0.020) and longer global nT1 (1124.9 ± 97.7 ms vs. 1007.4 ± 26.1 ms, p < 0.001) as compared to controls. Moreover, MVP patients showed lower RS and CS in basal (21.6 ± 12.3% vs. 27.6 ± 8.9%, p = 0.008, and - 13.0 ± 6.7% vs. - 14.9 ± 4.1%, p = 0.013) and mid-inferolateral (20.6 ± 10.7% vs. 28.4 ± 8.7%, p < 0.001, and - 12.8 ± 6.3% vs. - 16.5 ± 4.0%, p < 0.001) walls as compared to other myocardial segments. Similarly, MVP patients showed longer nT1 values in basal (1080 ± 68 ms vs. 1043 ± 43 ms, p < 0.001) and mid-inferolateral (1080 ± 77 ms vs. 1034 ± 37 ms, p < 0.001) walls as compared to other myocardial segments. Of note, nT1 values were significantly correlated with CS (r, 0.36; p < 0.001) and RS (r, 0.37; p < 0.001) but not with regurgitant volume. CONCLUSIONS: T1-map and CMR-FT identify subclinical left ventricle tissue changes in patients with MVP. Further studies are required to correlate these subclinical tissue changes with the outcome. KEY POINTS: â¢ T1 mapping (T1-map) and cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) techniques have been introduced for the early detection of interstitial myocardial fibrosis and deformation abnormalities. â¢ In MVP patients, we demonstrated a longer global nT1 with associated reduced global circumferential (CS) and radial strain (RS) as compared to control subjects. â¢ Among MVP patients, the mid-basal left ventricle inferolateral wall showed longer nT1 with reduced CS and RS as compared to other myocardial segments.

275859,Cancer Treatment Adaptations in the COVID-19 Era,2020,"In light of the favorable outcomes of few small, non‐randomized clinical studies, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients. In fact, subsequent clinical studies with COVID‐19 and HCQ have reported limited efficacy and poor clinical benefits. Unfortunately, a robust clinical trial for its effectiveness is not feasible at this emergency. Additionally, HCQ was suspected of causing cardiovascular adverse reactions (CV‐ AEs), but it has never been directly investigated. The objective of this pharmacovigilance analysis was to determine and characterize HCQ‐associated cardiovascular adverse events (CV‐AEs). We performed a disproportionality analysis of HCQ‐associated CV‐AEs using the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database. The FAERS database, comprising more than 11,901,836 datasets and 10,668,655 patient records with drug‐adverse reactions, was analyzed. The disproportionality analysis was used to calculate the reporting odds ratios (ROR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to predict HCQ‐associated CV‐AEs. HCQ was associated with higher reporting of right ventricular hypertrophy (ROR: 6.68; 95% CI: 4.02 to 11.17), left ventricular hypertrophy (ROR: 3.81; 95% CI: 2.57 to 5.66), diastolic dysfunction (ROR: 3.54; 95% CI: 2.19 to 5.71), pericarditis (ROR: 3.09; 95% CI: 2.27 to 4.23), torsades de pointes (TdP) (ROR: 3.05; 95% CI: 2.30 to 4.10), congestive cardiomyopathy (ROR: 2.98; 95% CI: 2.01 to 4.42), ejection fraction decreased (ROR: 2.41; 95% CI: 1.80 to 3.22), right ventricular failure (ROR: 2.40; 95% CI: 1.64 to 3.50), atrioventricular block complete (ROR: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.55 to 3.41) and QT prolongation (ROR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.74 to 2.52). QT prolongation and TdP are most relevant to the COVID‐19 treatment regimen of high doses for a comparatively short period and represent the most common HCQ‐associated AEs. The patients receiving HCQ are at higher risk of various cardiac AEs, including QT prolongation and TdP. These findings highlight the urgent need for prospective, randomized, controlled studies to assess the risk/benefit ratio of HCQ in the COVID‐19 setting before its widespread adoption as therapy.","Singh, Anand Prakash; Tousif, Sultan; Umbarkar, Prachi; Lal, Hind",J.

SARS-CoV-2 mortality/morbidity risk increases with age and for those chronic disease co-morbidities, both of which are associated with lower zinc status, as is the risk of infection. Methods: Rapid review methods will be applied to a systematic review of zinc for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and viral respiratory tract infections in humans. Included are published studies reporting randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compare zinc intervention to placebo and/or other comparator interventions. English and Chinese language databases will be searched for primary studies of viral respiratory tract infections and clinical trial registries for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Due to concerns about indirectness, studies evaluating non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections will be rated down by one level, and non-specific or confirmed non-coronavirus viral infections will be rated down by two levels. Review constraints include (1) using Google translate when screening articles published in languages other than English or Chinese and limited translation (2) following calibration, only one reviewer will screen articles, extract data, appraise quality and conduct the analysis, (3) prioritising data extraction and meta-analyses of SARS-CoV-2 studies and critical outcomes of other viral infections, followed by high risk groups and (4) reporting important preliminary findings prior to peer review if necessary.

276963,An interpretable mortality prediction model for COVID-19 patients,2020,"Reducing airborne infectious risk is crucial for controlling infectious respiratory diseases (e g , COVID-19) The airborne transmissibility of COVID-19 is high so that the common ventilation rate may be insufficient to dilute the airborne pathogens, particularly in public buildings with a relatively large occupancy density Reducing occupancy can reduce the pathogen load thereby reducing airborne infection risk However, reduced occupancy deteriorates work productivity due to the lost hours of work This study proposes an occupancy-aided ventilation strategy for constraining the airborne infection risk and minimizing the loss of work productivity Firstly, two mechanisms of occupancy schedule (alternative changeovers between normal occupancy and reduced occupancy) for reducing the airborne infection risk and loss of work productivity are revealed based on analyzing features of the indoor concentration profile of exhaled aerosols Secondly, optimization of the occupancy schedule is developed to maximize the total time length of normal occupancy for the minimum loss in work productivity while satisfying the constraint on airborne infection risk (e g , with the reproduction number less than one) The airborne infection risk is evaluated with the rebreathed fraction model Case studies on COVID-19 in a classroom demonstrate that the proposed occupancy-aided ventilation is effective with an earning ratio of 1 67 (the ratio of the improvement in health outcome to the loss in work productivity) and is robust to the variable occupancy loads and occupancy flexibilities","Zhang, Sheng Ai Zhengtao Lin Zhang",Building and Environment,,478

We further estimated that the cost at a national level to neutralize the revenue losses caused by COVID-19 among primary care practices would be $15.1 billion.

280282,Endocrinology and Covid-19: A Multifaceted Interaction,2020,"In this study, we review the psychometric literature on mating effort and find that extant instruments (1) have not been adequately evaluated in terms of internal structure and measurement invariance, and (2) disproportionately focus on mate retention and intrasexual competition tactics designed to repel competitors, relative to attraction and investment effort. To address these gaps in the literature, we carried out two studies to develop and validate a new Mating Effort Questionnaire (MEQ). In Study 1, we report a pilot study in which participants' responses to an item pool were submitted to exploratory factor analysis. In Study 2, we replicated the structure found in Study 1 using confirmatory factor analysis in an independent sample. A three-factor solution yielded the best fit. The three factors reflected respondents' allocation of energy to attracting high mate value partners when already mated, seeking out romantic partners when single, and investing in their current romantic partner and relationships. Strong partial measurement invariance held across the sexes, implying that observed scores may be used to compare them. We also found evidence of concurrent validity via associations between the MEQ and constructs such as sociosexual orientation, K-factor, mate retention behaviors, and respondents' sexual behavior. These findings suggest that the MEQ is a valid and novel measure of individual differences in mating effort which is well suited to complement existing mating effort measures.","Albert, Graham; Richardson, George B; Arnocky, Steven; Senveli, Zeynep; Hodges-Simeon, Carolyn R",Arch. sex. behav,,478

281656,Caring for Patients With Cancer During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy,2020,"During the pandemic, many healthcare professionals (HCPs) are overburdened by work and stress. The aim of the study was to examine alcohol intake, sleep disorders, and depressive symptoms of HCPs during the pandemic in comparison with the pre-pandemic period. Another goal was to indicate risk factors for mental state deterioration and an increase in alcohol use. A cross-sectional survey study was conducted from 1 April to 15 May 2020. HCPs (n = 158) completed questionnaires that probed for symptoms during and prior to the pandemic, including the Beck depression inventory (BDI), Social Support Scale (MOS-SSS), Athens insomnia scale (AIS), and Alcohol Timeline Followback (TLFB) calendar of alcohol consumption. Gender, age, education, marital status, work situation, income, participants' and relatives' COVID-19 diagnosis as correlates were analyzed. Depressive symptoms and insomnia became more severe during the pandemic among HCPs, while social support increased. The increase in depressive symptoms was even higher among women (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.05-7.36; p = 0.04) and was also positively correlated with work reduction (p = 0.02); the presence of sleep disorders was correlated with female gender. Alcohol consumption increased during the pandemic, and was correlated with both more time spent at work and income increase. HCPs involved in the treatment of COVID-19 need support and attention due to the excessive stress load during pandemics, resulting in depression, insomnia, and increased alcohol intake.","Klimkiewicz, Anna; Schmalenberg, Adrianna; Klimkiewicz, Jakub; Jasinska, Agata; Jasionowska, Joanna; Machura, Weronika; Wojnar, Marcin",,,478

While the concentrations of AMX and ENR tested were not toxic, OXY decreased plant growth and cell division. OXY induced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation and related oxidative stress through its interference with the activities of mitochondria electron transport chain enzymes, although those deleterious effects could be ameliorated by the presence of AMX and/or ENR, which prevented the overaccumulation of ROS by increasing catalase enzyme activity. L. minor plants accumulated significant quantities of AMX, ENR and OXY from the media, although competitive uptakes were observed when plants were submitted to binary or tertiary mixtures of those antibiotics. Our results therefore indicate L. minor as a candidate for phytoremediation of service waters contaminated by AMX, ENR, and/or OXY.","Gomes, Marcelo Pedrosa; Moreira Brito, Júlio César; Cristina Rocha, Daiane; Navarro-Silva, Mário Antônio; Juneau, Philippe",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,478

284625,Multicenter Analysis of Liver Injury Patterns and Mortality in COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) significantly impacted cardiac care delivery in a manner that has not been previously experienced in the United States. Attention and resources have focused on physicians, patients, and healthcare systems with little information regarding the effects on nurses and technologists in the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL). METHODS: A national, online survey was conducted for nurses and technologists working in the CCL in the United States. The survey was self administered, anonymous, and included 45 questions assessing baseline demographics, logistical changes to workflow and responsibilities, staff preparedness, and mental health. RESULTS: A total of 450 respondents completed the survey, including 283 nurses (63%) and 167 technologists (37%). A total of 349 (78%) were female and mean age range was 41-50 years. Responses indicated that 68% were the primary financial provider for their families, and 74% experienced >75% decrease in case volume despite a low inpatient COVID-19 census (54% of respondents with census <10%). There were high rates of direct care for COVID-19 patients (47%), relocation (45%), lay-off/furloughs of part-time or per diem staff (42%), lay-offs of full-time staff (12%), and decreased work hours (65%). A total of 95% expressed decreased morale with an increase in mental distress, including depression (36%). Predictors of depression included relocation status, staff preparedness, and work hours. CONCLUSION: Logistical changes to CCL staffing resulted in relocation, lay-offs, furloughs, and diminished work hours, with financial and emotional ramifications. Particular attention should be paid to those in large urban hospitals, those at risk for relocation, layoffs, and furloughs, and when preparedness and administrative communication is perceived as poor.","Estes, Bailey Ann; Varghese, Joji J; Jacques, Jared; Naidu, Srihari S",J. invasive cardiol,,478
284894,COVID-2019 outbreak: Negative swab but positive bronchoalveolar lavage?,2020,"COVID-19 triggered widespread disruption in the lives of university students across the United States. We conducted 9 online focus groups with 30 students from a large public university to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the food choices of those displaced from their typical residences due to the pandemic. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first qualitative research to examine the changes in food choice for US university students due to COVID-19 and offer insight into why these changes occurred. Students in this study reported significant, and often negative, changes in food choices during the pandemic compared to when on campus. Many students described changes in the foods they ate, the amount consumed, and increased snacking behaviors. We found food availability and household roles to be powerful factors influencing food choices. Most students had returned to family homes with many students taking a passive role in activities that shape food choices. Parents usually purchased groceries and prepared meals with students eating foods made available to them. Increased free time contributed to boredom and snacking for some students, while for a few students with increased skills and/or agency, additional free time was used to plan and prepare meals. About a third of the students attributed eating different foods at home to food availability issues related to the pandemic such as groceries being out of stock, purchasing non-perishable foods, or the inability to get to a store. This information may be helpful to researchers and health promotion professionals interested in the effects of COVID-19 on student nutrition and related food behaviors, including those interested in the relationship between context and food choice.","Powell, Patricia K; Lawler, Sheleigh; Durham, Jo; Cullerton, Katherine",Appetite,,478

The novel coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 started to threaten many people's lives and highly infectious risk of severe respiratory illness.COVID-19 is spread by human-to-human transmission through the droplet, faeco-oral route, and direct contact. Older adults and those with underlying health conditions are at greatest risk for severe infection and death due to COVID-19. Several researchers are showing that adults 60 and older, especially those with preexisting medical conditions, especially heart disease, lung disease, diabetes or cancer are more likely to have severe even deadly coronavirus infection than other age groups. A time-sensitive study was done among higher-risk, older adults living with pre-existing respiratory diseases to determine their current awareness of COVID-19, their perception of the seriousness of its threat. The study aims to determine the perception, attitude, and knowledge of COVID-19 infections among elders with respiratory diseases. An online questionnaire-based survey was conducted among 200 older people with preexisting respiratory infections. All the data from the survey was collected and it was analyzed statistically with the help of SPSS. Results showed that the majority of people were aware of coronavirus and its symptoms and mode of transmission. The current threatening pandemic caused by coronavirus has significant impacts on the daily routine life of our study population. Majority 57.71% have reported that the COVID-19 affected their regular hospital visits and treatments. Many of our participants are not feeling safe to go to the hospital during the current global threat. Preference over e-consulting was started by a few of our study population.

A concomitant of sedentariness is compromised mental health. We investigated the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on PA, sedentary behavior, and mental health across four Western nations (USA, UK, France, and Australia). METHODS: An online survey was administered in the second quarter of 2020 (N = 2541). We measured planned and unplanned dimensions of PA using the Brunel Lifestyle Physical Activity Questionnaire and mental health using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. Steps per day were recorded only from participants who used an electronic device for this purpose, and sedentary behavior was reported in hours per day (sitting and screen time). RESULTS: In the USA and Australia samples, there was a significant decline in planned PA from pre- to during lockdown. Among young adults, Australians exhibited the lowest planned PA scores, while in middle-aged groups, the UK recorded the highest. Young adults exhibited the largest reduction in unplanned PA. Across nations, there was a reduction of ~ 2000 steps per day. Large increases in sedentary behavior emerged during lockdown, which were most acute in young adults. Lockdown was associated with a decline in mental health that was more pronounced in women. CONCLUSIONS: The findings illustrate the deleterious effects of lockdown on PA, sedentary behavior, and mental health across four Western nations. Australian young and lower middle-aged adults appeared to fare particularly badly in terms of planned PA. The reduction in steps per day is equivalent to the non-expenditure of ~ 100 kcal. Declines in mental health show how harmful lockdowns can be for women in particular.","Karageorghis, Costas I; Bird, Jonathan M; Hutchinson, Jasmin C; Hamer, Mark; Delevoye-Turrell, Yvonne N; Guérin, Ségolène M R; Mullin, Elizabeth M; Mellano, Kathleen T; Parsons-Smith, Renée L; Terry, Victoria R; Terry, Peter C",BMC Public Health,,478
288357,Covid-19 follow-up planning: What will we be missing?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Proning has been shown to improve oxygenation and mortality in certain populations of intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Small observational analyses of COVID-19 patients suggest awake proning may lead to clinical improvement. Data on safety and efficacy is lacking. We sought to describe the effect of proning on oxygenation in nonintubated COVID-19 patients. We also evaluated feasibility, safety, and other physiological and clinical outcomes associated with this intervention. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study of nonintubated patients with COVID-19 who underwent proning per an Emergency Department (ED) clinical protocol. Patients with mild to moderate respiratory distress were included. We calculated change in oxygenation by comparing the oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (SpO2:FiO2) during the five minutes prior to proning and first 30 min of proning. We also captured data on respiratory rate, duration of proning, need for intubation, intensive care unit admission, survival to discharge. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled. Thirty were excluded for not meeting protocol inclusion criteria or missing baseline oxygenation data, leaving 22 for analysis. The SpO2:FiO2 ratio increased by a median of 5 (IQR: 0-15) in the post-proning period compared to the pre-proning period (median: 298 (IQR: 263-352) vs 295 (IQR: 276-350), p = 0.01). Respiratory rate did not change significantly between time periods. No immediate adverse events occurred during proning. Five patients (23%) were intubated within 48 h of admission. CONCLUSION: Early, awake proning may be feasible in select COVID-19 patients and was associated with improved oxygenation.","Dubosh, Nicole M; Wong, Matthew L; Grossestreuer, Anne V; Loo, Ying K; Sanchez, Leon D; Chiu, David; Leventhal, Evan L; Ilg, Annette; Donnino, Michael W",Am. j. emerg. med,,478
288520,[Dealing with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy],2020,"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified in patients in Wuhan, China. The virus, subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, spread worldwide and the disease (coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Older adults and individuals with comorbidities have been reported as being more vulnerable to COVID-19. Patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) have compromised immune function due to cirrhosis and are more susceptible to infection. However, it is unclear if patients with CLD are more vulnerable to COVID-19 and its complications than other populations. The high number of severe cases of COVID-19 has placed an unusual burden on health systems, compromising their capacity to provide the regular care that patients with CLD require. Hence, it is incredibly crucial at this juncture to provide a set of interim recommendations on the management of patients with CLD during the current COVID-19 outbreak.","Alqahtani, Saleh A; Aljumah, Abdulrahman A; Hashim, Almoutaz; Alenazi, Thamer H; AlJawad, Mohammed; Al Hamoudi, Waleed K; Alghamdi, Mohammed Y",Ann Saudi Med,,478

To understand and predict the transmission dynamics of this disease, mathematical models can be very effective. It has been shown that the fractional order is related to the memory effects, which seems to be more effective for modeling the epidemic diseases. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose fractional-order susceptible individuals, asymptomatic infected, symptomatic infected, recovered, and deceased (SEIRD) model for the spread of COVID-19. We consider both classical and fractional-order models and estimate the parameters by using the real data of Italy, reported by the World Health Organization. The results show that the fractional-order model has less root-mean-square error than the classical one. Finally, the prediction ability of both of the integer- and fractional-order models is evaluated by using a test data set. The results show that the fractional model provides a closer forecast to the real data.","Rajagopal, Karthikeyan; Hasanzadeh, Navid; Parastesh, Fatemeh; Hamarash, Ibrahim Ismael; Jafari, Sajad; Hussain, Iqtadar",Nonlinear Dyn,,478

290803,Covid-19 vaccine- induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia-a commentary on an important and practical clinical dilemma,2021,"Human coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause respiratory infection epidemics that sometimes expand into globally relevant pandemics. All human CoVs have sister strains isolated from animal hosts and seem to have an animal origin, yet the process of host jumping is largely unknown. RNA interference (RNAi) is an ancient mechanism in many eukaryotes to defend against viral infections through the hybridization of host endogenous small RNAs (miRNAs) with target sites in invading RNAs. Here, we developed a method to identify potential RNAi-sensitive sites in the viral genome and discovered that human-adapted coronavirus strains had deleted some of their sites targeted by miRNAs in human lungs when compared to their close zoonic relatives. We further confirmed using a phylogenetic analysis that the loss of RNAi-sensitive target sites could be a major driver of the host-jumping process, and adaptive mutations that lead to the loss-of-target might be as simple as point mutation. Up-to-date genomic data of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and Middle-East respiratory syndromes-CoV strains demonstrate that the stress from host miRNA milieus sustained even after their epidemics in humans. Thus, this study illustrates a new mechanism about coronavirus to explain its host-jumping process and provides a novel avenue for pathogenesis research, epidemiological modeling, and development of drugs and vaccines against coronavirus, taking into consideration these findings.","Meng, Qingren; Chu, Yanan; Shao, Changjun; Chen, Jing; Wang, Jian; Gao, Zhancheng; Yu, Jun; Kang, Yu",Brief Bioinform,,478

The diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 detection between healthcare worker-collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP + OP) swabs and patient performed self-collected random saliva was assessed. Paired NP + OP swabs and random saliva were collected and processed within 48 h of specimen collection from two cohort studies which recruited 562 asymptomatic adult candidates. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting Open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and nucleocapsid (N) genes was performed and the results were compared. Overall, 65 of 562 (28.1%) candidates tested positive for COVID-19 based on random saliva, NP + OP swabs, or both testing techniques. The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in random saliva compared to NP + OP testing (92.3%; 60/65 vs. 73.8%; 48/65; p < .05). The estimated sensitivity and specificity of random saliva were higher than NP + OP swabs (95.0; 99.9 vs. 72.2; 99.4). The Ct values of ORF1a and N genes were significantly lower in random saliva compared to NP + OP swabs specimens. Our findings demonstrate that random saliva is an alternative diagnostic specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Self-collected random oropharyngeal saliva is a valuable specimen that provides accurate SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing of a community.","Rao, Mohan; Rashid, Fairuz A; Sabri, Fashihah S A H; Jamil, Nur Nadia; Seradja, Valentinus; Abdullah, Nurul A; Ahmad, Hanisah; Aren, S L; Ali, Shareh A S; Ghazali, Mawaddah; Manaf, Anizan A; Talib, Harishah; Hashim, Rohaidah; Zain, Rozainanee; Thayan, Ravindran; Amran, Fairuz; Aris, Tahir; Ahmad, Norazah",J Med Virol,,478

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 15 April and 14 May 2020, a multicentre cross-sectional survey was performed to study depression, anxiety and resilience in a sample of Spanish pregnant women during the lockdown set up by the Government in response to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. We designed an anonymous online self-administered questionnaire (https://bit.ly/34RRpq1) that included the Spanish validated versions of the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Connor-Davidson Resilience 10-items Scale (CD-RISC-10). RESULTS: A total of 514 pregnant women completed the survey. 72.8% had been confined < 40 days and 27.2% between 41 and 60 days. 182 (35.4%) participants scored over 10, with 21.3% scoring over 13 (75th Percentile) in depressive symptoms rates. We found high trait and anxiety scores, with 223 (43.4%) and 227 (44.2%) pregnant women scoring over the trait and state mean scores. Neither depression, anxiety or resilience levels showed any significant correlation with the length of confinement. We found low CD-RISC-10 scores. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms during the quarantine, although we did not find an increased prevalence of psychological distress according to length of home confinement. Resilience correlated negatively with depression and anxiety.","Lubián López, Daniel María; Butrón Hinojo, Carmen Aisha; Arjona Bernal, Jose Eduardo; Fasero Laiz, María; Alcolea Santiago, José; Guerra Vilches, Virginia; Casaus Fernández, Marta; Bueno Moral, Ana; Olvera Perdigones, Antonio; Rodríguez Rodríguez, Begoña; Cuevas Palomino, Andrés; Presa Lorite, Jesús; Coronado Martín, Pluvio; Sánchez-Prieto, Manuel; Sánchez-Borrego, Rafael; González-Mesa, Ernesto",J Psychosom Obstet Gynaecol,,478

We draw attention to the trend of inverse relative COVID-19 mortality in Europe versus the states of the Southern Hemisphere (Australia, Brazil, South Africa) in dependence on season, which may be associated with intensity of ultraviolet radiation and consequent seasonal fluctuation of serum vitamin D levels. Although we cannot yet confirm causal role of vitamin D in SARS-CoV-2 positivity or COVID-19, we recommend consumption of vitamin D rich food or vitamin D supplementation in the non-sunny season to prevent vitamin D deficiency.","Kopecek, Miloslav; Höschl, Cyril",Cas Lek Cesk,,478

As elective procedures and surgeries get scheduled, ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) must implement some form of widespread testing in order to ensure the safety of both the ASC staff and the patients being seen. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently announced the approval of new serological testing for SARS-CoV-2, a test that can indicate the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum against viral particles. However, the possibility for reinfection raises questions about the utility of this new serological test, as the presence of IgG may not correspond to long-term immunity. SARS-CoV-2 has been known to form escape mutations, which may correspond to a reduction in immunoglobulin binding capacity. Patients who develop more robust immune responses with formation of memory CD8+ T-cells and helper CD4+ T-cells will be the most equipped if exposed to the virus, but, unfortunately, the serology test will not help us in distinguishing those individuals. Given the inherent disadvantages of serological testing, antibody testing alone should not be used when deciding patient care and should be combined with polymerase chain reaction testing.","Chaturvedi, Rahul; Naidu, Ramana; Sheth, Samir; Chakravarthy, Krishnan",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,478

To end the global COVID-19 pandemic major behavioral, social distancing, contact tracing, and state interventions has been undertaken to reduce the outbreak and avert the persistence of the coronavirus in humans in India and worldwide. In absence of any vaccine or therapeutics, forecasting is of utmost priority for health care planning and control the transmission of COVID-19. Methods: We have proposed a mathematical model that explain the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in India. Based on the estimated data our model predicts the evolution of epidemics and the end of SARS-CoV-2 and aids to evaluate the influence of different policies to control the spread of the diseases. Findings: With the real data for infected individuals, we find the basic reproduction number $R_0$ for 17 states of India and overall India. A complete figure is given to demonstrate the estimated pandemic life cycle along with the real data or history to date. Our study reveals that the strict control measures implemented in India substantially mitigated the disseminate of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, model simulations predict that 95% reduction of outbreak on June 26, 2020 and 99% reduction of outbreak on July 26, 2020 in India. Interpretation: Our model simulation demonstrates that the community-wide elimination of SARS-CoV-2 is possible by mitigating the social distancing and use essential precautions. Lockdown can be implemented strictly to prevent the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19. The model-based and parameter estimation of epidemic life cycle, and end dates, if can be done precisely, may decrease distress and over optimism and develop the mentality for all of us for the next stages of the outbreak evolution.","Sarkar, Kankan; Khajanchi, Subhas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07071v1.pdf,478

Assuming no unmeasured confounding, we estimate that vaccinations caused a -4.3 (-4.7, -3.8), -3.4 (-3.9, -2.9), and -4.8 (-5.4, -4.1) percentage point change in these outcomes, respectively. We further argue that these effects provide a lower bound on the mental health burden of the pandemic, implying that the COVID-19 pandemic was responsible for at least a 28.6 (25.3, 31.9) percent increase in feelings of depression and a 20.5 (17.3, 23.6) percent increase in feelings of isolation during February 2021 among vaccine-accepting CTIS survey respondents. We also posit a model where vaccinations affect depression through worries about health and feelings of isolation, and estimate the proportion mediated by each pathway. We find that feelings of social isolation is the stronger mediator, accounting for 41.0 (37.3, 44.7) percent of the total effect, while worries about health accounts for 9.4 (7.6, 11.1) percent of the total effect. We caution that the causal interpretation of these findings rests on strong assumptions. Nevertheless, as the pandemic continues, policymakers should also target interventions aimed at managing the substantial mental health burden associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rubinstein, Max; Haviland, Amelia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06834v2.pdf,478
294509,Designing COVID-19 mortality predictions to advance clinical outcomes: Evidence from the Department of Veterans Affairs,2021,"Chronic exposure to crystalline silica causes the development of silicosis, which is one of the most important occupational diseases worldwide. In the early stage of silicosis, inhaled silica crystals initiate oxidative stress, a cycle of persistent inflammation and lung injury. And it is crucial to prevent the deteriorative progression in the onset of the disease. Herein, we present a promising candidate for the treatment of crystalline silica-induced pulmonary inflammation, using a silicosis mouse model caused by intratracheal instillation based on local administration of ß-alanine and hydroxyl functionalized C70 fullerene nanoparticles (FNs). The results demonstrate that FNs could significantly alleviate inflammatory cells infiltration, lower the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduce the destruction of lung architecture stimulated by crystalline silica. Further investigations reveal that FNs could effectively inhibit the activation of NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3) inflammasome, and thus prevent the secretion of mature IL-1ß and neutrophil influx, deriving from the superior ROS scavenging capability. Importantly, FNs could not cause any obvious toxicity after pulmonary administration.","Liu, Shuai; Chen, Daiqin; Li, Xue; Guan, Mirong; Zhou, Yue; Li, Lei; Jia, Wang; Zhou, Chen; Shu, Chunying; Wang, Chunru; Bai, Chunli",Nanoscale,,478

Both surgical operations, and endoscopic procedures are considered as interventions with an increased risk of infection. Therefore, determining the algorithm becomes crucial for qualifying patients for surgical treatment, but also to stratify the risk of personnel being infected during surgery and to adequately protect staff. Each hospital should be logistically prepared for the need to perform urgent surgery on a patient with suspected or confirmed infection, including personal protective equipment. Limited availability of the equipment, working under pressure and staff shortages in addition to a highly contagious pathogen necessitate a pragmatic management of human resources in health care.

Objective: To evaluate the process of organization and the clinical results of intensive programs of cholecystectomy by videolaparoscopy on an ambulatory surgery basis. Methods: Among the 314 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis who were waiting for surgery at HCFMRP-USP, 160 were selected for treatment on an ambulatory basis. A multiprofessional team consisting of surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses and social workers scheduled 4 intensive programs to be performed on weekends according to the availability of the surgical block and of the post-anesthesia recovery room. In a retrospective evaluation, the authors analyzed 79 medical records of patients operated upon in the intensive programs I and II (Group A) and 79 records of the 80 patients operated upon in the intensive programs III and IV (Group B). Statistical analysis was concluded using the Wilcoxon and Fisher's exact tests, with the level of significance of p=0.05. Results: Co-morbidities were recorded for 48 patients of Group A (60.8%) and for 31 of Group B (39.8%), p=0.007. Acute inflammation and scleroatrophy of the gallbladder were observed in 10 patients of group A (12.7%) and in 2 patients of group B (2.6%). The mean duration of surgery was 90 minutes (25-240) for group A and 68.2 minutes (20-180) for group B, p=0.002. There was one conversion in each group (1.3%). Prophylaxis for pain and vomiting was performed in 13 (16.4%) and 2 (2.5%) patients of group A, respectively. In group B, 63 patients (79.7%) received prophylaxis with analgesics and 73 (92.5%) with anti-emetics. Abdominal pain, vomiting and cardiorespiratory symptoms during post-anesthetic recovery involved 34 (43%), 18 (22.6%) and 10 (12.6%) of the patients in group A and 18 (22.8%), 14 (17.7%) and 3 (3.8%) of the patients in group B. The need for an overnight stay was greater in group A: 45 patients (50.7%) with a mean hospital stay of 18.3 hours (2.2-26), while in group B 5 patients stayed overnight and the mean permanence time was 7.8 hours (4-24), p=0.000. Five hospital admissions occurred in group A (6.3%) and 2 in group B (2.5%). Medical re-evaluation during the first week was necessary for 8 patients of group A (10.2%) and resulted in 3 readmissions (3.8%). In group B, 2 patients (2.6%) sought health services but did not require readmission. In group A, 2 patients presented coliperitoneum and 1 was re-operated upon. No death occurred in either group. Conclusion: As experience was gained in these programs, the process of patient selection and the offer of preoperative care were improved, demonstrating that intensive programs of videolaparoscopic cholecystectomy are a possible strategy for the reduction of waiting lists.","Santos, J.

A great percentage of patients with this disease developed symptoms of dry cough, malaise, and a high fever. During this time, several patients requiring assessment and treatment of endodontic emergencies were directed to the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. We examined the characteristics of these patients. METHODS: A total of 96 patients with a mean age of 42.24 ± 18.32 years visited the general and emergency department of the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University because of endodontic emergencies during the peak period of February 22 to March 2, 2020. Patient information was collected and organized by date of visit, sex, age, and systemic disease history. Body temperature was measured and acquired for each patient, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiologic investigation questionnaire was given to each patient, an endodontic diagnosis was determined for the offending tooth, and a verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) was used to record pain levels. RESULTS: Of the total patient visits during this period, 50.26% of visits were for endodontic treatment. No patients had a fever (>37.2°C). One patient with a confirmed COVID-19 history was admitted after recovery. Three admitted patients had been exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. Twelve admitted patients (12.5%) with a mean age of 62.42 ± 13.77 years had a history of systemic diseases. The most common age group for endodontic emergencies was 45-64 years (30.21%), and patients of this group showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score compared with that of the 6- to 19-year age group and the 20- to 34-year age group (P < .05). The majority of endodontic emergency diagnoses were diseases of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (53.10%). Patients who were diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic apical periodontitis, and acute apical abscess showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score than that of other groups (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Endodontic emergencies, with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis being the most common, consist of a much higher proportion of dental emergencies in a COVID-19 high-risk area than normally. Vital pulp therapy can advantageously reduce treatment time, resulting in a reduced risk of infection for vital pulp cases. Rubber dams, personal protective equipment, and patient screening are of great importance during the COVID-19 outbreak in protecting clinicians.","Yu, Jingjing; Zhang, Tian; Zhao, Dan; Haapasalo, Markus; Shen, Ya",J Endod,,478

298533,Coagulation abnormalities and thrombosis in patients with COVID-19,2020,"Background: A new digital peak flow meter, known as Smart Peak Flow (SPF), has been developed to monitor asthma patients' peak expiratory flow (PEF) at home. It is connected wirelessly to any type of smartphone and it is used by asthma patients to self-monitor progress of their clinical condition. Thus evaluation of the SPF's ability to provide accurate PEF values is essential. The aim of this pilot work was to provide preliminary in-vivo data about the measurement agreement between the SPF and a lab spirometer for a first time. Methods: PEF measurements were obtained by 9 healthy adults as this pilot work was terminated earlier than it was expected due to COVID-19 restrictions. PEF readings (n=27) were recorded by the comparable devices at the same time during three different expiratory maneuvers performed by each participant. The Bland and Altman plot was used to assess the agreement. Results: Good agreement between the SPF and the lab spirometer was found with the mean bias being estimated 0.29 L/min. The lower and upper limits of agreement (LOA) were estimated 30.03 L/min and -30.61 L/min respectively. Conclusion: Due to a small sample size, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the SPF's accuracy. However the current promising results encourage further testing in the future.","Sakkatos, P.; Williams, A.",Digital Health,,478
298795,Clinical sensitivity and interpretation of PCR and serological COVID-19 diagnostics for patients presenting to the hospital,2020,"The exquisite chemodiversity of terpenoids is the product of the large diverse terpene synthase (TPS) superfamily. Here, by using structural and phylogenetic analyses and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified a residue (Cys440 in Nicotiana tabacum 5-epi-aristolochene synthase) proximal to an ion-binding motif common to all TPSs and named the preNSE/DTE residue, which determines the product specificity of sesquiterpene synthases from different plant species. In sesquiterpene synthases catalyzing 1,10-cyclization (1,10-cyclases) of farnesyl diphosphate, mutation of the residue in both specific and promiscuous 1,10-cyclases from different lineages leads to the accumulation of monocyclic germacrene A-11-ol, which is ""short-circuited"" from complex cyclization cascades, suggesting a key role of this residue in generating the first common intermediate of 1,10-cyclization. Altering this residue in a specific 1,11-cyclase results in alternative 1,10-cyclization products. Moreover, the preNSE/DTE residue can be harnessed to engineer highly specific sesquiterpene synthases for an improved proportion of high-value terpenoids, such as patchoulol, a main constituent of several traditional Chinese medicines that could treat SARS-CoV-2.","Huang, Jin-Quan; Li, Dong-Mei; Li, Jian-Xu; Lin, Jia-Ling; Tian, Xiu; Wang, Ling-Jian; Chen, Xiao-Ya; Fang, Xin",Org Biomol Chem,,478

While murine studies have yielded important insights into the cellular responses of GVHD, differences between murine and human biology has hindered the translation of novel therapies into the clinic. Recently, the field has expanded the ability to investigate primary human T cell responses through the transplantation of human T cells into immunodeficient mice. These xenogeneic HSCT models benefit from the human T cell receptors, CD4 and CD8 proteins having cross-reactivity to murine MHC in addition to several cytokines and co-stimulatory proteins. This has allowed for the direct assessment of key factors in GVHD pathogenesis to be investigated prior to entering clinical trials. In this review, we will summarize the current state of clinical GVHD research and discuss how xenogeneic HSCT models will aid in advancing the current pipeline of novel GVHD prophylaxis therapies into the clinic.","Hess, Nicholas J; Brown, Matthew E; Capitini, Christian M",Front Immunol,,478
299724,MULTIORGAN DAMAGE IN PATIENTS WITH COVID-19: IS THE TGF-ß /BMP PATHWAY THE MISSING LINK?,2020,"BACKGROUND: With the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, its effect on society is amplified. We aimed to describe the viral detection results across different timepoints throughout the disease course. METHODS: A retrospective study of 301 confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, were included. Demographic characteristics of the patients were collected. Upper respiratory specimens (throat and/or nasal swabs) were obtained and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Period of viral infection and the contagious stage were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 301 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the median age was 58 years and 51.2 % were male. The median period between symptoms presence and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results was 16 days (IQR, 10-23, Nâ¯=â¯301). The median period between symptoms presence and an effective negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result was 20 days (IQR, 17-24; Nâ¯=â¯216). Infected patient &#8805;65 years old stayed contagious longer (22 days vs 19 days, pâ¯=â¯0.015). Although two consecutive negative results were confirmed in 70 patients, 30 % of them had positive viral test results for the third time. Using specimens from nasal swabs to run the RT-PCR test showed a higher positive rate than using specimens from throat swabs. CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale investigation with 1113 RT-PCR test results from 301 COVID-19 patients showed that the average contagious period of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was 20 days. Longer observation period and more than 2 series of negative viral test are necessary for patients &#8805;65 years.","Xiao, Ai Tang; Tong, Yi Xin; Gao, Chun; Zhu, Li; Zhang, Yu Jie; Zhang, Sheng",J Clin Virol,,478

The secondary aim is to analyze the diagnostic value of hematologic parameters in COVID-19 complicated pregnancies. METHODS: The current study is conducted in a high volume tertiary obstetrics center burdened by COVID-19 pandemics, in Turkey. In this cohort study, perinatal outcomes and complete blood count indices performed at the time of admission of 39 pregnancies (Study group) complicated by COVID-19 were compared with 69 uncomplicated pregnancies (Control group). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnancies with COVID-19 compared to data of healthy pregnancies, except the increased C-section rate (p=0.026). Monocyte count, red cell distribution width (RDW), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR) were significantly increased (p<0.0001, p=0.009, p=0.043, p<0.0001, respectively) whereas the MPV and plateletcrit were significantly decreased (p=0.001, p=0.008) in pregnants with COVID-19. ROC analysis revealed that the optimal cut-off value for MLR was 0.354 which indicated 96.7% specificity and 59.5% sensitivity in diagnosis of pregnant women with COVID-19. A strong positive correlation was found between the MLR and the presence of cough symptom (r=41.4, p=<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that, pregnancies complicated by COVID-19 is not related with adverse perinatal outcomes. MLR may serve as a supportive diagnostic parameter together with the Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) in assessment of COVID-19 in pregnant cohort.","Erol Koç, Esin Merve; Findik, Rahime Bedir; Akkaya, Hatice; Karadag, Isilay; Tokalioglu, Eda Özden; Tekin, Özlem Moraloglu",J Perinat Med,,478
300037,Incidence of COVID-19 in outpatients with cancer receiving active treatment in the context of a pandemic: An Andalusian cohort study,2021,"The objective of this study was to compare the positive detection rates obtained using the Oxoid IMAGEN® direct immunofluorescence assay (designated as IF) with those obtained using the CLART® PneumoVir multiplex RT-PCR DNA microarray assay (designated as RT-PCR) in the diagnosis of respiratory viruses in hospitalized children. This was a retrospective study of 62 individuals < 18 years old who had nasopharyngeal aspirates collected for virus identification in a tertiary university hospital in south Brazil between January 1st, 2014 and December 31st, 2014. All 62 nasopharingeal aspirates were analyzed using both assay methods. The main outcome to be measured was the difference in the proportion of test samples returning a positive virus detection result between the IF and the RT-PCR. The McNemar test was used for data analysis and the results showed that the RT-PCR and the IF methods produced 55 (88.7 %) and 17 (27.4 %) virus-positive samples, respectively (pâ¯<â¯0.001). The most prevalent virus was rhinovirus (45.5 % of the RT-PCR positive samples). The RT-PCR method increased the detection rates of human respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus and parainfluenza 3 virus. The RT-PCR and IF had concordant results in 19 samples (30.6 %) and discordant results in 43 samples (69.4 %). It is concluded that in comparison to the Oxoid IMAGEN® IF method, the CLART® PneumoVir multiplex RT-PCR method had a greater potential to contribute to the clinical management of hospitalized children due its greater ability in detecting respiratory viruses than the IF method.","Ferreira, Isabel Cristina Schutz; Alegretti, Ana Paula; De Paris, Fernanda; Paiva, Rodrigo Minuto; Chakr, Valentina Coutinho Baldoto Gava",J Virol Methods,,478

Rational drug design against emerging threats depends on well-established methodology, mainly utilizing X-ray crystallography, to provide accurate structure models of the macromolecular drug targets and of their complexes with candidates for drug development. In the current crisis, the structural biological community has responded by presenting structure models of CoV-2 proteins and depositing them in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), usually without time embargo and before publication. Since the structures from the first-line research are produced in an accelerated mode, there is an elevated chance of mistakes and errors, with the ultimate risk of hindering, rather than speeding up, drug development. In the present work, we have used model-validation metrics and examined the electron density maps for the deposited models of CoV-2 proteins and a sample of related proteins available in the PDB as of April 1, 2020. We present these results with the aim of helping the biomedical community establish a better-validated pool of data. The proteins are divided into groups according to their structure and function. In most cases, no major corrections were necessary. However, in several cases significant revisions in the functionally sensitive area of protein-inhibitor complexes or for bound ions justified correction, re-refinement, and eventually reversioning in the PDB. The re-refined coordinate files and a tool for facilitating model comparisons are available at https://covid-19.bioreproducibility.org.

Since the disease does not currently have a particular treatment, there is a compelling need to find substitute means to dominate its expansion. In this rapid review, we aimed to determine some countries’ public responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: In this study, academic databases, including MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase, were investigated. The keywords applied in the search strategy besides the names of each country were: “Public Health,” “Public Response”, “Health Policy”, “COVID-19”, “Novel Coronavirus,” “2019-nCoV”, and “SARS-COV-2”. The countries included China, Italy, Iran, Spain, South Korea, Germany, France, United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, and Singapore. Results: The total number of retrieved articles in MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase in April 2020 was 594, and after removing 259 duplicate articles, 335 papers were screened by the experts. After this investigation, 50 articles, in addition to 12 webpages, were extensively reviewed for the results section. Public health strategies and responses can be divided into four main areas, including monitoring, public education, crowd controlling, and care facilities. Conclusion: According to the results of the management decisions of some governments on quarantining, social isolation, screening methods, and flight suspensions due to the severity and anonymity of COVID-19, it is highly assured that these strategies would be the most successful approaches to confront the present pandemic. Governments should put in place timely and strict measures to halt the spread and diminish its unintended deadly consequences.","Tabari, Parinaz; Amini, Mitra; Moghadami, Mohsen; Moosavi, Mahsa",Iran.

METHODS: In this study, data about 540 patients with stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) were analyzed from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases to determine the expression of eEF2K. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blots, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were also performed to determine the clinical significance of eEF2K expression in 96 postoperative patients with gastric cancer. Among the 96 patients, 36 had low expression of eEF2K and 60 had high expression. RESULTS: Analysis of the TCGA and GEO datasets revealed that eEF2K expression was significantly higher in the STAD tissue samples than in the non-tumorous gastric tissues. IHC, western blots, and RT-PCR confirmed these findings. The high expression level of eEF2K was found to be related to the presence of lymph node metastasis (p = 0.002). Moreover, multivariate analysis showed that eEF2K was an independent indicator of prognosis for overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-2.79; p = 0.03) and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 1.66, 95% CI = 0.997-2.765; p = 0.052) in patients with surgically resected STAD. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our findings suggest that eEF2K is a clinical indicator of metastatic and prognostic significance for STAD survival and could serve as a potential therapeutic target.","Jiang, Mingxia; Qi, Ling; Jin, Kexin; Li, Lisha; Wu, Yiming; Song, Dongfeng; Gan, Junqing; Huang, Mei; Li, Yanjing; Song, Chengxin",Pathol Res Pract,,478

Evidence suggests diabetes to be a risk factor for the progression and poor prognosis of COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to understand the pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients infected with COVID-19. We also aimed to compute the risk of mortality and ICU admissions in COVID-19 patients with and without diabetes. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed to identify the articles reporting the diabetes prevalence and risk of mortality or ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome was to compute the pooled prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 patients. Secondary outcomes included risk of mortality and ICU admissions in COVID-19 patients with diabetes compared to patients without diabetes. RESULTS: This meta-analysis was based on a total of 23007 patients from 43 studies. The pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients infected with COVID-19 was found to be 15% (95% CI: 12%-18%), p = <0.0001.

302422,Arrhythmias and COVID-19: A Review,2020,"Changs in individual behavior often entangles with the dynamic interaction of individuals, which complicates the epidemic process and brings great challenges for the understanding and control of the epidemic. In this work, we consider three kinds of typical behavioral changes in epidemic process that is, self-quarantine of infected individuals, self-protection of susceptible individuals, and social distancing between them. We connect the behavioral changes with individual's social attributes by the activity-driven network with attractiveness. A mean-field theory is established to derive an analytical estimate of epidemic threshold for SIS models with individual behavioral changes, which depends on the correlations between activity, attractiveness and the number of generative links in the susceptible and infected states. We find that individual behaviors play different roles in suppressing the epidemic. Although all the behavioral changes could delay the epidemic by increasing the epidemic threshold, self-quarantine and social distancing of infected individuals could effectively decrease the epidemic size. In addition, simultaneous changes in these behaviors and the timing of implement of them also play a key role in suppressing the epidemic. These results provide helpful significance for understanding the interaction of individual behaviors in the epidemic process.","Wang, Bing; Xie, Zeyang; Han, Yuexing",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.14143v1.pdf,478

While racial disparities in cumulative incidence (CmI) and mortality from the influenza pandemics of 1918 and 2009 implicated Blacks with survival disadvantage relative to Whites in the United States, COVID-19 currently indicates comparable disparities. We aimed to: (a) assess COVID-19 CmI by race, (b) determine the Black-White case fatality (CF) and risk differentials, and (c) apply explanatory model for mortality risk differentials. METHODS: COVID-19 data on confirmed cases and deaths by selective states health departments were assessed using a cross-sectional ecologic design. Chi-square was used for CF independence, while binomial regression model for the Black-White risk differentials. RESULTS: The COVID-19 mortality CmI indicated Blacks/AA with 34% of the total mortality in the United States, albeit their 13% population size. The COVID-19 CF was higher among Blacks/AA relative to Whites; Maryland, (2.7% vs. 2.5%), Wisconsin (7.4% vs. 4.8%), Illinois (4.8% vs. 4.2%), Chicago (5.9% vs. 3.2%), Detroit (Michigan), 7.2% and St. John the Baptist Parish (Louisiana), 7.9%.

We applied a bioinformatics approach using molecular dynamics and docking to identify FDA-approved drugs that can be re-purposed to potentially inhibit the non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9) replicase and spike proteins in SARS-CoV-2. We performed virtual screening of FDA-approved compounds, including antiviral, anti-malarial, anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, anti-tuberculosis, and active phytochemicals against the Nsp9 replicase and spike proteins. Selected hit compounds were identified based on their highest binding energy and favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) profile. Conivaptan, an arginine vasopressin antagonist drug exhibited the highest binding energy (-8.4 Kcal/mol) and maximum stability with the amino acid residues present at the active site of the Nsp9 replicase. Tegobuvir, a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus, also exhibited maximum stability along with the highest binding energy (-8.1 Kcal/mol) at the active site of the spike proteins. Molecular docking scores were further validated by molecular dynamics using Schrodinger, which supported the strong stability of ligands with the proteins at their active sites through water bridges, hydrophobic interactions, and H-bonding.

303636,Severe Bleeding Complications Resulting in Death Following Anticoagulant Treatment in COVID-19 Surgical Patients,2020,"In mathematics education, there is general agreement regarding the significance of mathematical literacy (also quantitative literacy or numeracy) for informed citizenship, which often requires evaluating the use of numbers in public policy discourse We hold that such an evaluation must accommodate the necessarily fragile relation between the information that numbers are taken to carry and the policy decisions they are meant to support In doing so, attention needs to be paid to differences in how that relation is formed With this in mind, we investigated a public discourse that heavily relied on numbers in the context of introducing, maintaining, and easing the rules and regulations directed to contain the spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2 during the first epidemic wave of COVID-19 in Germany with its peak in early April 2020 We used a public-service broadcasting outlet as data Our theoretical stance is affiliated with post-structuralist discourse theory As an outcome, we identified four major related strategies of using numbers, which we named rationalisation, contrast, association and recharging In our view explicit attention to these strategies as well as identifying new ones can aid the task of furthering critical mathematical literacy [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Educational Studies in Mathematics is the property of Springer Nature and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","Jablonka, Eva Bergsten Christer",Educational Studies in Mathematics,,478
303680,Remote Home Monitoring of Patients With Cancer During the COVID Pandemic: A Pilot Study,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted frail older adults, especially residents of long-term care (LTC) facilities. This has appropriately led to prioritization of frail older adults and LTC residents, and those who care for them, in the vaccination effort against COVID-19. Older adults have distinct immunological, clinical, and practical complexity, which can be understood through a lens of frailty. Even so, frailty has not been considered in studies of COVID-19 vaccines to date, leading to concerns that the vaccines have not been optimally tailored for and evaluated in this population even as vaccination programs are being implemented. This is an example of how vaccines are often not tested in Phase 1/2/3 clinical trials in the people most in need of protection. We argue that geriatricians, as frailty specialists, have much to contribute to the development, testing and implementation of COVID-19 vaccines in older adults. We discuss roles for geriatricians in ten stages of the vaccine development process, covering vaccine design, trial design, trial recruitment, establishment and interpretation of illness definitions, safety monitoring, consideration of relevant health measures such as frailty and function, analysis methods to account for frailty and differential vulnerability, contributions in regulatory and advisory roles, post-marketing surveillance, and program implementation and public health messaging. In presenting key recommendations pertinent to each stage, we hope to contribute to a dialogue on how to push the field of vaccinology to embrace the complexity of frailty. Making vaccines that can benefit frail older adults will benefit everyone in the fight against COVID-19.","Andrew, Melissa K; Schmader, Kenneth E; Rockwood, Kenneth; Clarke, Barry; McElhaney, Janet E",Clin Interv Aging,,478

305066,Exposure risk of patients with chronic infectious wounds during the COVID-19 outbreak and its countermeasures,2020,"Introduction: Orthopedic surgical procedures (OSPs) are known to generate bioaerosols, which could result in transmission of infectious diseases. Hence, this review was undertaken to analyse the available evidence on bioaerosols in OSPs, and their significance in COVID-19 transmission. Methods: A systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxiv and Lancet preprint databases for studies on bioaerosols in OSPs. Random-effects metanalysis was conducted to determine pooled estimates of key bioaerosol characteristics. Risk of bias was assessed by the RoB-SPEO tool; overall strength of evidence was assessed by the GRADE approach. Results: 17 studies were included in the systematic review, and 6 in different sets of meta-analyses. The pooled estimate of particle density was 390.74â¯µg/m3, Total Particle Count, 6.08â¯×â¯106/m3, and Microbial Air Contamination, 8.08â¯CFU/m3. Small sized particles (</â¯=â¯0.5 µm) were found to be 37 and 1604 times more frequent in the aerosol cloud in comparison to medium and large sized particles respectively. 4 studies reported that haemoglobin could be detected in aerosols, and one study showed that HIV could be transmitted by blood aerosolized by electric saw and burr. The risk of bias for all studies in the review was determined to be high, and the quality of evidence, low. Conclusion: Whereas there is evidence to suggest that OSPs generate large amounts of bioaerosols, their potential to transmit infectious diseases like COVID-19 is questionable. High-quality research, as well as consensus minimum reporting guidelines for bioaerosol research in OSPs is the need of the hour.","Sharma, Siddhartha; John, Rakesh; Patel, Sandeep; Neradi, Deepak; Kishore, Kamal; Dhillon, Mandeep S",,,478
305182,Prevalence of Elevated Liver Enzyme in Covid-19 and Its Association with Disease Outcome,2020,"This study explored social factors that are associated with the US deaths caused by COVID‐19 after the declaration of economic reopening on May 1, 2020 by President Donald Trump. We seek to understand how county‐level support for Trump interacted with social distancing policies to impact COVID‐19 death rates. Overall, controlling for several potential confounders, counties with higher levels of Trump support do not necessarily experience greater mortality rates due to COVID‐19. The predicted weekly death counts per county tended to increase over time with the implementation of several key health policies. However, the difference in COVID‐19 outcomes between counties with low and high levels of Trump support grew after several weeks of the policy implementation as counties with higher levels of Trump support suffered relatively higher death rates. Counties with higher levels of Trump support exhibited lower percentages of mobile staying at home and higher percentages of people working part time or full time than otherwise comparable counties with lower levels of Trump support. The relative negative performance of Trump‐supporting counties is robust after controlling for these measures of policy compliance. Counties with high percentages of older (aged 65 and above) persons tended to have greater death rates, as did more populous counties in general. This study indicates that policymakers should consider the risks inherent in controlling public health crises due to divisions in political ideology and confirms that vulnerable communities are at particularly high risk in public health crises. Counties with higher levels of Trump support did not necessarily experience greater mortality rates due to COVID‐19. The predicted weekly death counts per county tend to increase over time with the implementation of several key health policies. The difference in COVID‐19 outcomes between counties with low and high levels of Trump support grew after several weeks of the policy implementation as counties with higher levels of Trump support suffered relatively higher death rates.

305194,Analysis of changes and influencing factors of T cell count in COVID -19 patients,2020,"Rapid diagnosis and case isolation are pivotal to controlling the current pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, a label-free DNA capacitive biosensor for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 that demonstrates real-time, low-cost, and high-throughput screening of nucleic acid samples is presented. Our novel biosensor composed of the interdigitated platinum/titanium electrodes on the glass substrate can detect the hybridization of analyte DNA with probe DNA. The hybridization signals of specific DNA sequences were verified through exhaustive physicochemical analytical techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry, contact-angle analysis, and capacitance-frequency measurements. For a single-step hybridized reaction, the fabricated kit exhibited significant sensitivity (capacitance change, &#916;C = ~2 nF) in detecting the conserved region of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene with high sensitivity of 0.843 nF/nM. In addition to capacitive measurements, this selective detection was confirmed by the fluorescence image and intensity from a SARS-CoV-2 gene labeled with a fluorescent dye. We also demonstrated that the kits are recyclable by surface ozone treatment using UV irradiation. Thus, these kits could potentially be applied to various types of label-free DNA, thereby acting as rapid, cost-effective biosensors for several diseases.","Hwang, Chuljin; Park, Nakkyun; Kim, Eun Seong; Kim, Miran; Kim, Su Dong; Park, Sungjun; Kim, Nam Young; Kim, Joo Hee",Biosens Bioelectron,,478

We found that all TSPs are important, especially in terms of reaching vulnerable groups. They need, however, to be used simultaneously in an integrated manner to be successful and should be linked to crisis and disaster management. It is also important to enhance targeting of vulnerable groups within universalism to protect groups of individuals who require additional or different kinds of support, for example, migrant or informal workers. If these additional integrated policies become part of long‐term development policies, they could be instrumental in ensuring that no one is left behind when the SDGs are implemented.","Kempf, Isabell Dutta Paramita",Sustainable Development,,478

For this, the study was conducted in Bhadaure-Tamagi village of the Panchase Protected Forest Area of Gandaki Province, which was planned to be developed as an important tourist destination for tourists visiting Pokhara because of its cultural and natural importance. Mixed-method research approach was implemented in this research for data collection and analysis. One hundred and twenty-two tourism stakeholders (30 hoteliers, 40 homestay owners, and 52 tourists) were surveyed for quantitative data collection and analysis along with seven key informant interviews (KII) for qualitative data collection and analysis. It was observed that the current demand for accommodation facilities in the Bhadaure-Tamagi village was 23,390 bed nights per annum. The tourism demand in terms of tourism revenues estimated through this study amounted to a total of US$10,763.67 per year. The occupancy rate of accommodation facilities at Bhadaure-Tamagi village was a mere 20%, which is well below the national and international average. Despite outstanding ecotourism opportunities and a necessary regulatory framework in place, the SWOT analysis revealed that the tourism sector development is not satisfactory. In the current situation, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) had adversely affected the ecotourism in the area. So, tourism promotional activities need to be focused by following appropriate health, hygiene, and safety measures.","Neupane, Ramesh; K C, Anup; Aryal, Manoj; Rijal, Kedar",Environ Dev Sustain,,478

The most relevant antiviral activities of Qx are related to its ability to raise pH in acidic organelles, diminishing viral enzymatic activity for viral cell entry, and its ability to bind to viral DNA and RNA. Moreover, Qx has been used as an immunomodulator in cutaneous lupus erythematosus and various rheumatological diseases, by inhibiting phospholipase A2 modulating the Th1/Th2 response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential antiviral effect of Qx against denominated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Vero E6 cells. The cytotoxicity of Qx in Vero E6 cells was determined by the MTT assay. Afterwards, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at different multiplicities of infections (MOIs) of 0.1 and 0.01 in the presence of Qx (0-30 µM) to determinate the half maximal effective concentration (EC50). After 48 h, the effect of Qx against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by viral cytotoxicity and viral copy numbers, the last were determined by digital real-time RT-PCR (ddRT-PCR). Additionally, electron and confocal microscopy of Vero E6 cells infected and treated with Qx was studied.

311016,Dermatological diseases presented before COVID-19: Are patients with psoriasis and superficial fungal infections more vulnerable to the COVID-19?,2020,"FPR2, a member of the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), mediates neutrophil migration, a response that has been linked to ß-arrestin recruitment. ß-Arrestin regulates GPCR endocytosis and can also elicit non-canonical receptor signaling. To determine the poorly understood role of ß-arrestin in FPR2 endocytosis and in NADPH-oxidase activation in neutrophils, Barbadin was used as a research tool in this study. Barbadin has been shown to bind the clathrin adaptor protein (AP2) and thereby prevent ß-arrestin/AP2 interaction and ß-arrestin-mediated GPCR endocytosis. In agreement with this, AP2/ß-arrestin interaction induced by an FPR2-specific agonist was inhibited by Barbadin. Unexpectedly, however, Barbadin did not inhibit FPR2 endocytosis, indicating that a mechanism independent of ß-arrestin/AP2 interaction may sustain FPR2 endocytosis. This was confirmed by the fact, that FPR2 also underwent agonist-promoted endocytosis in ß-arrestin deficient cells, albeit at a diminished level as compared to wild type cells. Dissection of the Barbadin effects on FPR2-mediated neutrophil functions including NADPH-oxidase activation mediated release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chemotaxis revealed that Barbadin had no effect on chemotactic migration whereas the release of ROS was potentiated/primed. The effect of Barbadin on ROS production was reversible, independent of ß-arrestin recruitment, and similar to that induced by latrunculin A. Taken together, our data demonstrate that endocytic uptake of FPR2 occurs independently of ß-arrestin, while Barbadin selectively augments FPR2-mediated ROS production independently of receptor endocytosis. Given that Barbadin binds to AP2 and prevents the AP2/ß-arrestin interaction, our results indicate a role for AP2 in FPR2-mediated ROS release from neutrophils.","Sundqvist, Martina; Holdfeldt, André; Wright, Shane C; Møller, Thor C; Siaw, Esther; Jennbacken, Karin; Franzyk, Henrik; Bouvier, Michel; Dahlgren, Claes; Forsman, Huamei",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,,478

According to theories of stress spillover, stressors originating outside the relationship, such as work stress and financial uncertainty, often undermine relationship quality. However, if individuals can easily attribute their problems to the stressful circumstances, their relationship may be more resilient. Given the salience of the pandemic, the current study used two waves of 14-day daily diary data collected from 191 participants to examine whether blaming the pandemic for problems may reduce stress spillover. We also expected the buffering effect of pandemic blaming attributions to wane as stressful conditions persisted and continued to tax partners’ coping resources. Multilevel modeling confirmed that women, but not men, who were more blaming of the pandemic exhibited reduced stress spillover during the COVID-19 outbreak;notably, this buffering effect did not weaken over time. © The Author(s) 2021.","Neff, L.

311057,Is butyrate a natural alternative to dexamethasone in the management of CoVID-19?,2021,"Nrf2 is an important transcription factor involved in the antioxidant response and is widely expressed in animal tissues. The function of Nrf2 is regulated by its negative regulator Keap1 by inducing its cytoplasmic degradation. Recent studies have suggested that Nrf2 is also regulated post-transcriptionally via miRNAs. However, to date, how miRNAs regulate Nrf2 in fish skeletal muscles is unknown. In this study, the full-length cDNAs with 2398 bp of the Nrf2 was firstly cloned by SMART RACE amplification tools from Chinese perch. The Nrf2 gene structure and its 3'-UTR region for possible miRNA binding sites, as well as its spatial expression profile were assayed. Then, we employed TargetScan Fish tool MiRNAnome to predict putative sites for five miRNAs including miR-181a-5p, MiR-194a, MiR-216a, miR-459-5p, and miR-724. Using qRT-PCR assay, we found that Nrf2 mRNA levels have negative correlation with all five miRNAs expression in muscle of nutritionally deprived fish, and that ectopic expression of miR-181a-5p alone reduces Nrf2 mRNA levels. Luciferase reporter assay in a heterologous cell system revealed that each of the five miRNAs reduced Nrf2 expression, suggesting a direct regulatory mechanism. Moreover, the miR-181a-5p suppression using specific antagomir led to a significant increase in Nrf2 expression in vivo. At the same time, the expression levels of the antioxidant enzymes CAT, ZnSOD, GPx, GSTA, and GSTA genes increased significantly after injecting miR-181a-5p antagomir. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that miRNAs are involved in the Nrf2 signaling networks in regulation of oxidative stress in fish, at least in Chinese perch muscle.","Wu, Ping; Chen, Lin; Cheng, Jia; Pan, Yaxiong; Guo, Xinhong; Chu, Wuying; Zhang, Jianshe; Liu, Xuanming",,,478

RECENT FINDINGS: Recent guidelines on the use of CT scans in COVID-19 vary between countries. However, the consensus is that it should not be used as the first line; a notion supported by the WHO. Currently, several investigations are being used including reverse transcription PCR testing, chest radiographs, and ultrasound scans, and CT scans. They are ideally performed later during the disease process as the sensitivity and specificity are highest by that time. Typical COVID-19 features on CT scans vary but include vascular enlargement, ground-glass opacities, and ground glass opacification together with consolidation. SUMMARY: Since COVID-19 was declared as a global pandemic, there was a push towards identifying appropriate diagnostic tests that are both reliable and effective. There is a general agreement that CT scans have a high sensitivity but low specificity in diagnosing COVID-19. However, the quality of available studies is not optimal, so this must always be interpreted with the clinical context in mind. Clinicians must aim to weigh up the practicalities and drawbacks of CT scans when considering their use for a patient. The ease and speed of use of CT scans must be balanced with their high radiation doses, and infection control considerations.","Axiaq, Ariana; Almohtadi, Ahmad; Massias, Samuel A; Ngemoh, Dorette; Harky, Amer",Curr Opin Pulm Med,,478
314099,Challenges and recommendations for cancer care in the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Aging impairs senses, mastication, oral status and function, causing nutritional needs and diet insufficiencies. The present needs of independent older adults suggest that health research and oral health care should shift from reductionist disease management to integral and personal treatment plans, including lifestyle, psychological, nutritional and oral health coaching approaches. Dentists and other medical professionals that work in the field of gerodontology should be educated on the macro and micronutrient needs of the elderly and incorporate certain nutritional plans early in the life of their patients with their approval and cooperation, in order to postpone tooth loss and masticatory impairment. Old recipes such as the Mediterranean diet should be kept as a base for all the elderly and be enriched in a customized interpersonal way from the dentist as well as the medical professional according to the specific needs of one's oral and general health status. In this nonsystematic review paper, the basic aspects of the vicious cycle of nutrition and oral health status are discussed and suggestions of major nutrients' influence and needs for independent elders are reported. Based on the scientific data collected, suggestions are made for the food industry for better quality and dosage of foods for this category of individuals. Such strategies can be a whole new area of interest for the food industry in order to obtain better quality of food packaging for the independent OA with accepted texture, odor, colors, macronutrients and micronutrients' consistency and in specific portions.","amp,; 913,; ntoniadou, Maria; Varzakas, Theodoros",Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr,,478

It has spread over most of the countries in the world, leading to the infection of millions of people with a death rate of 2-3% simultaneously causing a serious economic crisis. It resulted in significant pollution reduction, but effects to combat COVID-19 led to an increase of some special pollutants. In such circumstances water can be considered as a cleaning and diluting agent for pollutants, providing hygienic conditions, as well as valuable raw material for the production of a variety of goods necessary for combating COVID-19. On the contrary, water can be viewed as a potential threat in relation to the virus spreading. Within the context of the human water cycle, we have identified possible hotspots related to risks of infection spreading. It may occur when contaminated water is reused (grey and black water), or insufficiently purified water enters the environment, which might interfere with drinking water.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study involved 32 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were divided into two groups according to the evidence of fibrosis on their latest follow-up CT imaging. Clinical data and CT imaging features of all the patients in different stages were collected and analyzed for comparison. RESULTS: The latest follow-up CT imaging showed fibrosis in 14 patients (male, 12; female, 2) and no fibrosis in 18 patients (male, 10; female, 8). Compared with the non-fibrosis group, the fibrosis group was older (median age: 54.0 years vs. 37.0 years, p = 0.008), and the median levels of C-reactive protein (53.4 mg/L vs. 10.0 mg/L, p = 0.002) and interleukin-6 (79.7 pg/L vs. 11.2 pg/L, p = 0.04) were also higher. The fibrosis group had a longer-term of hospitalization (19.5 days vs. 10.0 days, p = 0.001), pulsed steroid therapy (11.0 days vs. 5.0 days, p < 0.001), and antiviral therapy (12.0 days vs. 6.5 days, p = 0.012). More patients on the worst-state CT scan had an irregular interface (59.4% vs. 34.4%, p = 0.045) and a parenchymal band (71.9% vs. 28.1%, p < 0.001). On initial CT imaging, the irregular interface (57.1%) and parenchymal band (50.0%) were more common in the fibrosis group. On the worst-state CT imaging, interstitial thickening (78.6%), air bronchogram (57.1%), irregular interface (85.7%), coarse reticular pattern (28.6%), parenchymal band (92.9%), and pleural effusion (42.9%) were more common in the fibrosis group. CONCLUSION: Fibrosis was more likely to develop in patients with severe clinical conditions, especially in patients with high inflammatory indicators. Interstitial thickening, irregular interface, coarse reticular pattern, and parenchymal band manifested in the process of the disease may be predictors of pulmonary fibrosis. Irregular interface and parenchymal band could predict the formation of pulmonary fibrosis early.","Yu, Minhua; Liu, Ying; Xu, Dan; Zhang, Rongguo; Lan, Lan; Xu, Haibo",Korean J Radiol,,478
315737,Pediatric routine vaccinations in the COVID 19 lockdown period: the survey of the Italian Pediatric Society,2021,"COVID-19 can affect the central nervous system (CNS) indirectly by inflammatory mechanisms and even directly enter the CNS. Thereby, COVID-19 can evoke a range of neurosensory conditions belonging to infectious, inflammatory, demyelinating, and degenerative classes. A broad range of non-specific options, including anti-viral agents and anti-inflammatory protocols, is available with varying therapeutic. Due to the high mortality and morbidity in COVID-19-related brain damage, some changes to these general protocols, however, are necessary for ensuring the delivery of therapeutic(s) to the specific components of the CNS to meet their specific requirements. The biomaterials approach permits crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and drug delivery in a more accurate and sustained manner. Beyond the BBB, drugs can protect neural cells, stimulate endogenous stem cells, and induce plasticity more effectively. Biomaterials for cell delivery exist, providing an efficient tool to improve cell retention, survival, differentiation, and integration. This paper will review the potentials of the biomaterials approach for the damaged CNS in COVID-19. It mainly includes biomaterials for promoting synaptic plasticity and modulation of inflammation in the post-stroke brain, extracellular vesicles, exosomes, and conductive biomaterials to facilitate neural regeneration, and artificial nerve conduits for treatment of neuropathies. Also, biosensing surfaces applicable to the first sensory interface between the host and the virus that encourage the generation of accelerated anti-viral immunity theoretically offer hope in solving COVID-19.","Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Emergent Mater,,478

315839,The neurological impact of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Identification of infected healthcare workers (HCWs) is an important step in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission control. Rapid antigen tests (RATs) are considered an important addition to molecular tests in diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), mainly because of their fast turnaround time, easier analytical procedure and lower price. However, real-life studies on the usefulness of such testing for screening of HCWs are limited. METHODS: Physicians, nurses and hospital attendants currently working at the University Clinic of Respiratory and Allergic Diseases Golnik were invited to participate in the pilot study. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained three times per week for two consecutive weeks and tested with a point-of-care RAT and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum samples were obtained at the beginning of the study and 2 weeks after the last swab was collected to evaluate the serological status. RESULTS: A total of 191 nasopharyngeal swabs from 36 HCWs were obtained. None of the samples tested was positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen, whereas two HCWs tested positive on RT-PCR. Of these, one HCW had a newly identified SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas RT-PCR probably detected a previous but recent infection in the other HCW. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this pilot study, it is unlikely that RAT will reliably detect novel SARS-CoV-2 infections among asymptomatic HCWs despite serial sampling. Although RT-PCR-based screening of HCWs may not be feasible due to high sample volume, molecular methods may identify SARS-CoV-2-infected HCWs already during the presymptomatic stage.

316017,Molecular mechanisms for thrombosis risk in Black people: a role in excess mortality from COVID-19,2020,"Developing robust methods to detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a causative agent for the current global health pandemic, is an exciting area of research. Nevertheless, the currently used conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique in COVID-19 diagnosis endures with some inevitable limitations. Consequently, the establishment of rapid diagnostic tools and quick isolation of infected patients is highly essential. Furthermore, the requirement of point-of-care testing is the need of the hour. Considering this, we have provided a brief review of the use of very recently reported robust spectral tools for rapid COVID-19 diagnosis. The spectral tools include, colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), with the admittance of principal component analysis (PCA) and machine learning (ML) for meeting the high-throughput and fool-proof diagnostic platforms for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, are reviewed. Recently, these techniques have been readily applied to screen a large number of suspected patients within a short period and they demonstrated higher sensitivity for the detection of COVID-19 patients from unaffected human subjects.","Mohanty, Abhijeet; Fatrekar, Adarsh P; Krishnan, Saravanan; Vernekar, Amit A",Results Chem,,478

In the present study, we conceived a novel pair-based multiobjective approach implemented in an adapted SMILES generative algorithm based on recurrent neural networks for the automated de novo design of new molecules whose overall features are optimized by finding the best trade-offs among relevant physicochemical properties (MW, logP, HBA, HBD) and additional similarity-based constraints biasing specific biological targets. In this respect, we carried out the de novo design of chemical libraries targeting neuraminidase, acetylcholinesterase, and the main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Several quality metrics were employed to assess drug-likeness, chemical feasibility, diversity content, and validity. Molecular docking was finally carried out to better evaluate the scoring and posing of the de novo generated molecules with respect to X-ray cognate ligands of the corresponding molecular counterparts. Our results indicate that artificial intelligence and multiobjective optimization allow us to capture the latent links joining chemical and biological aspects, thus providing easy-to-use options for customizable design strategies, which are especially effective for both lead generation and lead optimization.

316296,Trans-Atlantic aeromedical repatriation of multiple COVID-19 patients: a hybrid military-civilian model,2020,"Data is published on the web over time in great volumes, but majority of the data is unstructured, making it hard to understand and difficult to interpret. Information Extraction (IE) methods extract structured information from unstructured data. One of the challenging IE tasks is Event Extraction (EE) which seeks to derive information about specific incidents and their actors from the text. EE is useful in many domains such as building a knowledge base, information retrieval, summarization and online monitoring systems. In the past decades, some event ontologies like ACE, CAMEO and ICEWS were developed to define event forms, actors and dimensions of events observed in the text. These event ontologies still have some shortcomings such as covering only a few topics like political events, having inflexible structure in defining argument roles, lack of analytical dimensions, and complexity in choosing event sub-types. To address these concerns, we propose an event ontology, namely COfEE, that incorporates both expert domain knowledge, previous ontologies and a data-driven approach for identifying events from text. COfEE consists of two hierarchy levels (event types and event sub-types) that include new categories relating to environmental issues, cyberspace, criminal activity and natural disasters which need to be monitored instantly. Also, dynamic roles according to each event sub-type are defined to capture various dimensions of events. In a follow-up experiment, the proposed ontology is evaluated on Wikipedia events, and it is shown to be general and comprehensive. Moreover, in order to facilitate the preparation of gold-standard data for event extraction, a language-independent online tool is presented based on COfEE.","Balali, Ali; Asadpour, Masoud; Jafari, Seyed Hossein",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.10326v2.pdf,478

In this study, we performed clot waveform analyses to investigate whether specific modulations are observed in COVID-19 subjects. We analyzed the second derivative of the absorbance in routine APTT tests performed using an ACL-TOP system. We observed high frequencies of abnormal patterns in APTT second-derivative curves that could be classified into an early shoulder type, a late shoulder type, or a biphasic type, high maximum first-derivative and second-derivative peak levels, and a low minimum second-derivative peak level in COVID-19 subjects. These modulations were not observed in subjects with disseminated intravascular coagulation. These abnormal patterns are also observed in patients with lupus anticoagulant, hemophilia, or factor IX deficiency. The plasma fibrinogen levels might also be involved in the abnormal APTT waveforms, especially the high maximum first-derivative and second-derivative peak levels. The abnormal patterns in the APTT second-derivative curves appear with highest frequency at around 2 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 and were not associated with the severity of COVID-19.

METHOD AND RESULTS: Multi-centre, observational, cohort study over a 100-day period during the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19) in the USA. Remote monitoring was used to assess AF episodes in patients with a CIED (pacemaker or defibrillator; 20 centres, 13 states). For comparison, the identical 100-day period in 2019 was used (Control). The primary outcomes were the AF burden during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the association of the pandemic with AF occurrence, as compared with 1 year prior. The secondary outcome was the association of AF occurrence with per-state COVID-19 prevalence. During COVID-19, 10 346 CIEDs with an atrial lead were monitored. There were 16 570 AF episodes of &#8805;6 min transmitted (16 events per 1000 patient days) with a significant increase in proportion of patients with AF episodes in high COVID-19 prevalence states compared with low prevalence states [odds ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-1.48, P < 0.001]. There were significantly more AF episodes during COVID-19 compared with Control [incident rate ratio (IRR) 1.33, 95% CI 1.25-1.40, P < 0.001]. This relationship persisted for AF episodes &#8805;1 h (IRR 1.65, 95% CI 1.53-1.79, P < 0.001) and &#8805;6 h (IRR 1.54, 95% CI 1.38-1.73, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: During the first 100 days of COVID-19, a 33% increase in AF episodes occurred with a 34% increase in the proportion of patients with AF episodes observed in states with higher COVID-19 prevalence. These findings suggest a possible association between pandemic-associated social disruptions and AF in patients with CIEDs.

Despite the unprecedented research interest in this field, the lack of specific treatments leads to severe complications in a high number of cases. Current treatment includes antivirals, corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, antimalarials, interleukin-6 inhibitors, anti-GM-CSF, convalescent plasma, immunotherapy, antibiotics, circulation support, oxygen therapy, and circulation support. Due to the limited results, until specific treatments are available, other therapeutic approaches need to be considered. The endocannabinoid system is found in multiple systems within the human body, including the immune system. Its activation can lead to beneficial results such as decreased viral entry, decreased viral replication, and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-&#945;, or IFN-Î³. Moreover, endocannabinoid system activation can lead to an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines, mainly represented by IL-10. Overall, the cannabinoid system can potentially reduce pulmonary inflammation, increase the immunomodulatory effect, decrease PMN infiltration, reduce fibrosis, and decrease viral replication, as well as decrease the 'cytokine storm'. Although the cannabinoid system has many mechanisms to provide certain benefits in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, research in this field is needed for a better understanding of the cannabinoid impact in this situation.","Lucaciu, Ondine; Aghiorghiesei, Ovidiu; Petrescu, Nausica Bianca; Mirica, Ioana Codruta; Benea, Horea RareÈ Ciprian; Apostu, DragoÈ",Drug Metab Rev,,478

In light of this, this article explores the potential of SE international expansion as a catalyst for scaling social impact across borders. From our reading of the literature, we discern three major typologies of cross-border scaling: Control-based, altruism-based, and hybrid. Drawing on a multiple-case study of nine international SEs, we examine why and how SEs deploy these scaling strategies on an international scale; the challenges to maximize social impact across borders associated with each of the scaling strategies, and the resources and actions that SEs can mobilize to manage such challenges associated with international expansion. Contrary to conventional wisdom and mainstream theory depicting SEs as small-sized organizations that suffer from different limitations to expand beyond their traditional national boundaries, our findings illustrate how these organizations can successfully operate on an international scale and simultaneously generate financial, social, and environmental value.","Bretos, Ignacio; Díaz-Foncea, Millán; Marcuello, Carmen",Sustainability,,478

The screened circRNAs were verified in the third largest cohort, and the ROC curves were drawn to assess the diagnostic efficiency. RESULTS: As discovered by experiment, there were a total of 67 circRNAs presented differential expressions between the two groups, with 28 circRNAs upregulated and 39 circRNAs downregulated in DFU group. Two types of circRNAs, hsa_circ_0000907 and hsa_circ_0057362, were selected as candidate biomarkers in current study and validated in a large cohort. The AUCs of serum hsa_circ_0000907 and hsa_circ_0057362 to diagnose early DFU were 0.9389 and 0.8792, respectively, and the AUCs of exosomal hsa_circ_0000907 and hsa_circ_0057362 to diagnose early DFU were 0.8783 and 0.8481, respectively. Furthermore, the expressions of serum hsa_circ_0000907 and hsa_circ_0057362 were negatively correlated with ankle brachial index (ABI) and transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) in DFU patients. CONCLUSIONS: Serum and exosomal hsa_circ_0000907 and hsa_circ_0057362, especially hsa_circ_0000907, have novel diagnostic capabilities in the early diagnosis of DFU.","Chen, Z-J; Shi, X-J; Fu, L-J; Liu, J; Shi, K; Zhang, W-B; Su, P-K",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,478

319991,Managing Severe Aortic Stenosis in the COVID-19 Era,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 helicase Nsp13 is a promising target for developing anti-COVID drugs. In the present study, we have identified potential natural product inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 targeting the ATP-binding site using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD simulation of the prepared crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 was performed to generate an ensemble of structures of helicase Nsp13 capturing the conformational diversity of the ATP-binding site. A natural product library of more than 14,000 phytochemicals from Indian medicinal plants was used to perform virtual screening against the ensemble of Nsp13 structures. Subsequently, a two-stage filter, first based on protein-ligand docking binding energy value and second based on protein residues in the ligand-binding site and non-covalent interactions between the protein residues and the ligand in the best-docked pose, was used to identify 368 phytochemicals as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 helicase Nsp13. MD simulations of the top inhibitors complexed with protein were performed to confirm stable binding, and to compute MM-PBSA based binding energy. From among the 368 potential phytochemical inhibitors, the top identified potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 helicase Nsp13 namely, Picrasidine M, (+)-Epiexcelsin, Isorhoeadine, Euphorbetin and Picrasidine N, can be taken up initially for experimental studies.","Vivek-Ananth, R P; Krishnaswamy, Sankaran; Samal, Areejit",Mol. divers,,478

Clinically, its initial manifestation may mimic oral lichen planus or lichen sclerosus. If the habit is not halted, the mucosa gets leathery and thickened, and fibrous bands form causing significant morbidity. Microscopically, it is characterized by atrophic epithelium, loss of rete ridges, and hyalinization of lamina propria. Of note, these hallmark histological features may be overlooked in the unusual presence of lichenoid interface changes, which may lead to the wrong diagnosis. We present herein 5 cases in which the rare joint appearance of OSF and lichenoid reaction features posed a diagnostic challenge. Because of its progressive nature and malignant potential, the presence of oral lichenoid changes overlying submucous hyalinization, in the right clinical and demographic setting, should raise suspicion of OSF and prompt actions directed at quid-chewing discontinuation.

METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study involving 142 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and moderate inflammation divided into three treatment groups (pulses of methylprednisolone alone [groupI], tocilizumab alone [groupII] and methylprednisolone plus tocilizumab [groupIII]). The aim was to assess intergroups differences in the clinical course with a 60-day follow-up and related analytical factors. RESULTS: 14 patients (9,8%) died: 8 (10%) in groupI and 6 (9,5%) in groupsII andIII. 15 (10,6%) were admitted to ICU: 2 (2,5%) from groupI, 4 (28,5%) from groupII and 9 (18,4%) from groupIII. The mean hospital stay was longer in groupII and clinical outcome was not associated with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab seems to be not associated with better clinical outcomes and should be reserved for clinical trial scenario, since its widespread use may result in higher rate of ICU admission and longer mean hospital stay without differences in mortality rate and potentially adverse events.","Aomar-Millán, Ismael Francisco; Salvatierra, Juan; Torres-Parejo, Úrsula; Nuñez-Nuñez, María; Hernández-Quero, José; Anguita-Santos, Francisco",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),,478

We sought to determine the willingness of Australians to take a (then prospective) COVID-19 vaccine, compared with their previously recorded opinions about other vaccines. We also sought to determine reasons for hesitancy, levels of support for possible government mandates, and the political basis of support. We surveyed 1200 Australians, including 898 participants in a panel previously asked in 2017 about vaccines and mandates. In all, 66% of respondents indicated they would take a coronavirus vaccine, less than the 88% who in 2017 agreed that vaccines are safe, effective, and necessary. Also, 70% of the respondents who indicated hesitancy were concerned about the safety of the vaccine if it was developed too quickly, and 73% of all respondents agreed that the government should require a coronavirus vaccine for work, travel, and study. This is lower than the 85% who agreed with the childhood vaccine mandate in 2017, but slightly higher than the number of respondents who indicated that they would definitely be willing to take the coronavirus vaccine themselves. Older respondents, higher income respondents, and respondents who vote for major parties were all significantly more likely to take a coronavirus vaccine and to support government requirements.

321403,Innovation and Knowledge Sharing Can Transform COVID-19 Infection Prevention Response,2020,"Transfer factor (TF), also called ""Lawrence transfer factor"", or dialyzable leukocyte extract (DLE), has been used since the mid-twentieth century to transfer specific skin hypersensitivity through the injection of leukocytes from immunized donors to animals and humans. The main mechanism of action of TF has been suggested at the level of cell-mediated immunity, as it induces the production of migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and interferon gamma (IFN-Î³). Otherwise, TF can inhibit nuclear factor &#954;-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#954;B), and decrease tumoral necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;) and IL-4 levels. Given these biological effects, TF has been prescribed for a wide variety of conditions including infections, allergies, autoimmunity, and cancer, with inconsistent results. The exact nature of TF, however, remains unknown, so it has been impossible to accurately define its pharmacokinetics or dosage. This is further complicated because researchers have used TF in a variety of ways across the different studies: antigen-specific or non-antigen-specific, orally or subcutaneously administered, human and non-human origin. In this review we summarize the most important data about what TF is, its mechanism of action, how it is produced, its biological effects, and the available clinical trials using it, in order to establish its role and potential clinical applications in modern medicine.","Macias, Alejandro E; Guaní-Guerra, Eduardo",Arch. med. res,,478

324112,Negative pressure aerosol containment box: An innovation to reduce COVID-19 infection risk in healthcare workers,2020,"Introduction: Medical students are known to have high levels of depression, anxiety and stress from the high-pressure environments that they study and train in. The coronavirus pandemic presents source of stress and anxiety to large populations in general, and to healthcare professionals in particular. This study was undertaken to assess the psychological effects of this pandemic on the mental health of medical students and trainees. Materials and Methods: An online questionnaire was designed to capture information on the participant's anxieties related to the pandemic and included a validated tool for the assessment of anxiety and depression symptoms (GAD-7 and PHQ-9, respectively). The questionnaire was prepared on Google Forms, and the link to the questionnaire was disseminated to 113 medical students and junior doctors on 19 April 2020, and the survey closed on 22 April 2020 midnight. Results: The survey was sent to 113 students, and 83 students participated. Of the participants, 47 (56.6%) were female and 36 (43.4%) were male, and 80 (96.4%) were aged less than 30 years old. Formal anxiety and depression scores using the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 tools indicated 15/82 (18.3%) had anxiety scores of 0 (lowest possible) and 21/82 (25.6%) had the lowest possible depression score of 0. However, 6/82 (7.3%) had scores that were classified as severe depression. Females had significantly higher median anxiety (5 v 2, p < 0.002) and depression scores (5 v 3, p = 0.025) than male participants. Direct patient care and care of patients with Covid-19 did not result in significant deterioration in anxiety and depression. Conclusion: Female students/junior doctors showed higher anxiety and depression scores than males. Direct patient care and care of patients with Covid-19 did not result in a measurable deterioration in anxiety and depression in this study. In this stressful pandemic situation, it is imperative to look after the mental health of healthcare workers as well as patients.","Pandey, Uma; Corbett, Gillian; Mohan, Suruchi; Reagu, Shuja; Kumar, Shubham; Farrell, Thomas; Lindow, Stephen",J Obstet Gynaecol India,,478

To assess the utility of the measures and the need for their continuation, we conducted an online survey of Ontario oncology clinicians. The survey was open 3-25 September 2020 and generated 105 responses. Between April and June 2020, 46% of respondents changed treatment plans for more than 25% of their cancer patients due to the pandemic. Clinicians report broad use of interim funding measures. The most frequently reported strategies used were treatment breaks for stable patients (62%), extending dosing intervals (59%), and deferring routine imaging (56%). Most clinicians anticipate continuing to use these interim funding measures in the coming months. The survey showed that adapting cancer drug funding policies has supported clinical care in Ontario during the pandemic.","Naipaul, Rohini D; Mercer, Rebecca E; Chan, Kelvin K W; Yeung, Lyndee; Forbes, Leta; Gavura, Scott",Curr Oncol,,478

The first case of COVID-19 in the United States of America (USA) was confirmed on 21 January 2020, in Snohomish County in Washington State (WA). Following this, a rapid explosion of COVID-19 cases was observed throughout WA and the USA. Lack of access to publicly available spatial data at finer scales has prevented scientists from implementing spatial analytical techniques to gain insights into the spread of COVID-19. Datasets were available only as counts at county levels. The spatial response to COVID-19 using coarse-scale publicly available datasets was limited to web mapping applications and dashboards to visualize infected cases from state to county levels only. This research approaches data availability issues by creating proxy datasets for COVID-19 using publicly available news articles. Further, these proxy datasets are used to perform spatial analyses to unfolding events in space and time and to gain insights into the spread of COVID-19 in WA during the initial stage of the outbreak. Spatial analysis of theses proxy datasets from 21 January to 23 March 2020, suggests the presence of a clear space–time pattern. From 21 January to 6 March, a strong presence of community spread of COVID-19 is observed only in close proximity of the outbreak source in Snohomish and King Counties, which are neighbors. Infections diffused to farther locations only after a month, i.e., 6 March. The space–time pattern of diffusion observed in this study suggests that implementing strict social distancing measures during the initial stage in infected locations can drastically help curb the spread to distant locations.","Thakar, Vaishnavi",ISPRS Int.

Results: 21/337 (6.2%) patients were SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid re-positive, and 4 /337(1.2%) patients were suspected positive. The median day interval between the discharge to nucleic acid re-positivity was 7.5 days (IQR, 6–13), ranging from 6 to 13 days. Cough/expectoration are the most common symptoms, followed by chest congestion/dyspnea during the 2 weeks post-discharge quarantine. Risk factors of nucleic acid re-positivity including the number of lobes infiltration (odds ratio[OR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09–1.19), distribution (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.13–0.19), CT imaging feature of patchy shadowing accompanying with consolidation (OR, 9.36; 95% CI, 7.84–11.17), respiratory symptoms of cough accompanying with expectoration (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.28–1.52), and chest congestion accompanying by dyspnea (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.28–1.57). Conclusion: The 2 weeks post-discharge quarantine may be an effective measure to prevent the outbreak from rebounding from the recovered patients. The second week is a critical period during post-discharge quarantine. Special attention should be paid to cough, expectoration, chest congestion, and dyspnea in recovered COVID-19 patients. A few recovered patients may prolong the quarantine based on clinical symptoms and signs and nucleic acid results in the 2 weeks of medical observation.","Yan, Nao; Wang, Wei; Gao, Yongzhe; Zhou, Junhui; Ye, Jiuhong; Xu, Zhipeng; Cao, Jing; Zhang, Junjian",Front.

Data from 56 non-hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection referred to our nuclear medicine department from July–December 2020 for a perfusion only SPECT/CT study or a ventilation perfusion SPECT/CT study were collected. Images were assessed for the presence and type of perfusion defects. The CT component of the study was also assessed for the presence of mosaic attenuation and COVID pneumonia changes. Results: Thirty-two (57.1%) cases had perfusion defects. There were 20 (35.7%) cases with defects in keeping with pulmonary embolism, 17 (30.4%) cases with defects associated with mosaic attenuation but not due to pulmonary embolism, and 6 (10.7%) of cases with defects due to pulmonary infiltrates from COVID pneumonia. A total of 24 (42.9%) cases had mosaic attenuation on CT, with 10 (17.9%) of them showing a pattern likely consistent with shunting on the perfusion images. Conclusion: Lung perfusion abnormalities are a common finding in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients with mild disease. They are usually either due to pulmonary embolism, parenchymal infiltrates, or other causes of mosaic attenuation related to, but not specific to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection. The value of VQ SPECT/CT imaging is also shown in this study, in detecting and differentiating the various types of perfusion abnormalities. © 2021, The Author(s).","Evbuomwan, O.; Engelbrecht, G.; Bergman, M.

Initially, mostly laboratory developed molecular tests were available but shortly thereafter different commercial assays started to appear and are still increasing in number. Although independent performance evaluations are ongoing, available data is still scarce. Here we provide a direct comparison of key performance characteristics of 13 commercial RT-PCR assays. Thirteen RT-PCR assays were selected based on the criteria that they can be used following generic RNA extraction protocols, on common PCR platforms and availability. Using a 10-fold and 2-fold dilution series of a quantified SARS-CoV-2 cell-cultured virus stock, performance was assessed compared to our in house validated assay. Specificity was tested by using RNA extracted from cultured common human coronaviruses. All RT-PCR kits included in this study exhibited PCR efficiencies > 90%, except for the Sentinel Diagnostics B E-gene RUO assay (80%). Analytical sensitivity varied between 3.3 RNA copies to 330 RNA copies. Only one assay cross reacted with another human coronavirus (MERS). This study provides a technical baseline of 13 different commercial PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection that can be used by laboratories interested in purchasing any of these for further full clinical validation.","Iglói, Zsófia; Leven, Margareta; Abdel-Karem Abou-Nouar, Zain; Weller, Babette; Matheeussen, Veerle; Coppens, Jasmine; Koopmans, Marion; Molenkamp, Richard",J Clin Virol,,478

328692,COVID IN THE PRISONS Reply,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major health emergency in today's time. In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China was attributed to a novel coronavirus. The World Health Organization declared it as a pandemic. As the majority of the cases suffering from COVID-19 are mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic, it becomes a great challenge to identify the infected persons in the absence of extensive testing. In the hospital environment, it can infect several other vulnerable patients and healthcare providers, significantly impacting the hospital services. Anesthesiologists are at an increased risk of COVID-19 transmission from the patients, as they are frequently involved in several aerosol-generating procedures. It is not possible to identify asymptomatic COVID-19 patients solely based on history-taking during their first point of contact with the anesthesiologists at the preanesthetic checkup clinic. Most of the neurosurgical conditions are of urgent in nature and cannot be postponed for a longer duration. In view of this, the position statement and practice advisory from the Indian Society of Neuroanaesthesiology and Critical Care (ISNACC) provides guidance to the practice of neuroanesthesia in the present scenario. The advisory has been prepared considering the current disease status of the COVID-19 pandemic, available literature, and consensus from experts in the field of neuroanesthesiology. Since the pandemic is still progressing and the nature of the disease is dynamic, readers are advised to constantly look for updated literature from ISNACC and other neurology and neurosurgical societies.","Jangra, K.; Manohar, N.; Bidkar, P.

Little is known about the efficacy of PR in these patients. We therefore compared post-COVID-19 patients (PG) referred to PR patients with other lung diseases (LG). METHODS: 99 PG were admitted to PR. In a prospective design, the results of PG were collected and compared to the results of LG of 2019 (n = 419) according to Functional Independence Measurement (FIM), Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS), 6-min walk test (6-MWT), duration of PR, and Feeling Thermometer (FT). RESULTS: According to age, sex, and CIRS, both groups showed no significant differences. The improvements in the 6-MWT in the pre to post comparison were on average 180 (±101) meters for PG and 102 (±89) meters for LG (p < 0.001). FT showed a significant enhancement for PG of 21 (±14) points and for LG of 17 (±16) points (p < 0.039), while FIM significantly increased by 11 (±10) points in PG and 7 (±8) points in LG (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive PR in PG is very effective according to the results in FIM, 6-MWT and FT. Therefore, we recommend PR following severe post-COVID-19 infections.","Spielmanns, Marc; Pekacka-Egli, Anna-Maria; Schoendorf, Sabine; Windisch, Wolfram; Hermann, Matthias",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,478

The PS-PICCSBs mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) have successfully fabricated and characterized based on spectral and microscopic analyses, porosity, zeta potential, water contact angle, and water uptake (wettability) measurements. The PWF, fouling-resistance against bovine serum albumin (BSA), as well as ion exchange capacity (IEC) against nitrate anion were studied. The wettability, hydrophilicity and overall porosity of new MMMs have greatly increased, in comparison to a pristine PS membrane (M0). In addition, blending of PS with PICCSBs resulted in switching its surface from negatively- to positively-charged. The PWF of MMMs has increased to reach a maximum value of 238.6â¯L/m2â¯h for MMM1 (9.3-fold higher than M0). Meanwhile, BSA rejection has declined from 96.62% for M0 to 41.9% for MMM1. The fouling parameters results of MMMs indicated their low fouling propensity. The IEC of nitrate anions revealed that the nitrate uptake by MMM1 is higher than that for M0 and MMM2 by 34% and 14%, respectively.","Elshaarawy, Reda F M; Abd El-Aal, Reda M; Mustafa, Fatma H A; Borai, Ahmed E; Schmidt, Stephan; Janiak, Christoph",Int. j. biol. macromol,,478

It is vital to continue investigating the landscape of SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia and therapeutic interventions. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a study that aims to compare the pneumonia exacerbation rate between ciclesonide (Alvesco R) administration and symptomatic treatment in COVID-19 patients and to determine the efficacy of ciclesonide (Alvesco R). The secondary objectives are to investigate the safety of ciclesonide (Alvesco R) administration, changes in clinical and laboratory findings, and the number of viral genome copies of SARS-CoV-2 over time between the two groups. METHODS: In this investigator-initiated, exploratory, prospective, multi-center, parallel-group, open-label, randomized trial, a total of 90 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with specific inclusion/exclusion criteria will be recruited from 21 hospitals in Japan. Participants will be randomized to either the ciclesonide group receiving ciclesonide (Alvesco R) 400 µg dose three times a day over a seven-day period or to the symptomatic treatment group. Both groups will antitussives and antipyretics as required. Data collection for various parameters will be conducted on days 1, 2, 4, 8, 22, and 29 to record baseline assessments and the findings over an extended period. Computed tomography (CT) image scans prior to drug administration and 1 week following treatment will be compared, and efficacy will be confirmed by checking for pneumonia exacerbation. Primary endpoint analysis will be performed using Fisher's exact test to determine statistically significant differences in the pneumonia exacerbation rate between the ciclesonide and symptomatic treatment groups. RESULTS: The first trial participant was enrolled on April 3, 2020; recruitment is expected to be completed on September 30, 2020, while follow-up assessments of all participants are expected to be completed by October 31, 2020. The study results will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. CONCLUSIONS: The RACCO study will provide definitive comparative effectiveness data and important clinical outcomes data between the ciclesonide and symptomatic treatment groups. If the hypotheses that pneumonia exacerbation rate reduction is more significant in the ciclesonide treatment group than in the symptomatic treatment group and that ciclesonide is safe for use are valid, ciclesonide (Alvesco R) will serve as an important therapeutic option for COVID-19 patients.

The aims of the study were: (1) to examine the trajectories of anxiety, depression, and pandemic-related stress factors (PRSF) of COVID-19 hospitalized patients one-month following hospitalization; (2) to assess the presence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) a month after hospitalization; (3) to identify baseline risk and protective factors that would predict PTSS one month after hospitalization. METHODS: We contacted hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 64) by phone, at three time-points: during the first days after admission to the hospital (T1); after ~two weeks from the beginning of hospitalization (T2), and one month after hospitalization (T3). At all time-points we assessed the levels of anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as PRSF. At T3, PTSS were assessed. RESULTS: The levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms decreased one-month following hospitalization. Moreover, higher levels of anxiety (standardized ß = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.81-1.49, p < 0.001) and depression (ß = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.63-1.31 p < 0.001) symptoms during the first week of hospitalization, feeling socially disconnected (ß = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37-0.81 p < 0.001) and experiencing a longer hospitalization period (ß = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.03-0.47 p = 0.026) predicted higher PTSS scores a month post-hospitalization.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective data (January 1, 2018, to July 31, 2020) on firearm incidents/injuries/deaths and types of firearm violence were obtained from the Gun Violence Archive. The periods for SAH and reopening for the US were based on dates for California. Ohio dates were based on Ohio's timeline. Mann-Whitney U analyses compared trends and types of daily firearm violence per 100,000 legal firearm owners across 2018-2020 periods. RESULTS: In California, SAH and reopening orders had no effect on firearm violence in 2020 compared with 2018 and 2019 periods, respectively. In Ohio, daily median firearm deaths increased during 2020 SAH compared with 2018 and 2019 and firearm incidents and injuries increased during 2020 reopening compared with 2018, 2019 and 2020 SAH. In the United States, during 2020, SAH firearm deaths increased compared with historical controls and firearm incidents, deaths and injuries increased during 2020 reopening compared with 2018, 2019 and 2020 SAH (all P < 0.05). Nationally, when compared with 2018 and 2019, 2020 SAH had increased accidental shootings deaths with a decrease in defensive use, home invasion, and drug-involved incidents. CONCLUSIONS: During 2020 SAH, the rates of firearm violence increased in Ohio and the United States but remained unchanged in California. Nationally, firearm incidents, deaths and injuries also increased during 2020 reopening versus historical and 2020 SAH data.

335553,Are Blood Groups Protective Against COVID-19?,2021,"COVID-19 is an emerging viral illness that has rapidly transmitted throughout the world. Its impact on society and the health care system has compelled hospitals to quickly adapt and innovate as new information about the disease is uncovered. During this pandemic, essential medical and surgical services must be carried out while minimizing the risk of disease transmission to health care workers. There is an elevated risk of COVID-19 viral transmission to health care workers during surgical procedures of the head and neck due to potential aerosolization of viral particles from the oral cavity/naso-oropharynx mucosa. Thus, patients with facial fractures pose unique challenges to the variety of injuries and special considerations, including triaging injuries and protective measures against infection. The proximity to the oral cavity/naso-oropharyngeal mucosa, and potential for aerosolization of secretions containing viral particles during surgical procedures make most patients undergoing operative interventions for facial fractures high risk for COVID-19 transmission. Our proposed algorithm aims to balance patient care with patient/medical personnel protection as well as judicious health care utilization. It stratifies facial trauma procedures by urgency and assigns a recommended level of personal protective equipment, extreme or enhanced, incorporating current best practices and existing data on viral transmission. As this pandemic continues to evolve and more information is obtained, the protocol can be further refined and individualized to each institution.","Hsieh, Tsung-Yen; Dedhia, Raj D; Chiao, Whitney; Dresner, Harley; Barta, Ruth J; Lyford-Pike, Sofia; Hamlar, David; Stephan, Scott J; Schubert, Warren; Hilger, Peter A",Facial Plast Surg Aesthet Med,,478

Patients with severe COVID-19 have a higher probability and progression of liver injury than those without severe disease. We aimed to evaluate the prognosis of liver injury in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively included 502 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical features and survival of patients with and without liver injury were compared. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the variables that might have an effect on survival. RESULTS: Among the 502 patients enrolled, 301 patients had abnormal liver function with increased neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, creatinine, troponin I (TnI), D-dimer, lactose dehydrogenase and creatine kinase. Patients with abnormal liver functions had a higher mortality rate (28.9% vs 9.0%, P < 0.001), a higher ratio of male sex (65.1% vs 40.8%, P < 0.001) and a higher chance of developing systemic inflammatory response syndrome (53.5% vs 41.3%, P = 0.007). Among patients with abnormal liver functions, patients with grade 2 liver damage (with both abnormal alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels and abnormal alkaline phosphatase or gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels) had a higher ratio of male patients, elevated neutrophil count, procalcitonin, D-dimer levels and mortality rate. Multivariate Cox regression analyses suggested that the grade of liver damage (hazard ratio: 1.377, 95% confidence interval: 1.000-1.896, P = 0.049) was an independent predictor of death. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 and abnormal liver functions have a higher mortality than those with normal liver functions. Liver damage is an independent prognostic factor of COVID-19.","Chen, Liu Ying; Chu, Hui Kuan; Bai, Tao; Tu, Sheng Jin; Wei, Yuan; Li, Zhong Lin; Hu, Li Lin; Zhu, Rui; Zhang, Lei; Han, Chao Qun; Xiao, Li; He, Qi; Song, Jun; Liu, Wei Hua; Zhu, Qing Jing; Chen, Hua; Yang, Ling; Hou, Xiao Hua",J Dig Dis,,478

Recent studies have found that â 15.7% of patients develop severe pneumonia, and cytokine storm is an important factor leading to rapid disease progression. Currently, there are no specific drugs for COVID-19 and the cytokine storm it causes. IL-6 is one of the key cytokines involved in infection-induced cytokine storm. Tocilizumab, which is the IL-6 receptor antagonist, has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), is expected to treat cytokine storm caused by COVID-19 and is now in clinical trials. In this paper, we will elaborate the role of cytokine storm in COVID-19, the mechanism of tocilizumab on cytokine storm and the key points of pharmaceutical care based on the actual clinical application for COVID-19 in our hospital, the latest research reports, clinical trial progress of tocilizumab, drug instruction from the US FDA, and ""Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (seventh trial edition)"" in China, so as to provide reference for the treatment of COVID-19.","Zhang, Shengyu; Li, Lei; Shen, Aizong; Chen, Yongwu; Qi, Zhigang",Clin Drug Investig,,478

However, we do not sufficiently know whether inequalities are related to social characteristics of communities, such as collective engagement. We tested whether neighborhood social cohesion is associated with inequalities in COVID-19 diagnosis rate and the extent the association varies across neighborhood racial composition. We calculated COVID-19 diagnosis rates in Philadelphia, PA, per 10,000 general population across 46 ZIP codes, as of April 2020. Social cohesion measures were from the Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey, 2018. We estimated Poisson regressions to quantify associations between social cohesion and COVID-19 diagnosis rate, testing a multiplicative interaction with Black racial composition in the neighborhood, which we operationalize via a binary indicator of ZIP codes above vs. below the city-wide average (41%) Black population. Two social cohesion indicators were significantly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis. Associations varied across Black neighborhood racial composition (p <0.05 for the interaction test). In ZIP codes with &#8805;41% of Black people, higher collective engagement was associated with an 18% higher COVID-19 diagnosis rate (IRR=1.18, 95%CI=1.11, 1.26). In contrast, areas with <41% of Black people, higher engagement was associated with a 26% lower diagnosis rate (IRR=0.74, 95%CI=0.67, 0.82). Neighborhood social cohesion is associated with both higher and lower COVID-19 diagnosis rates, and the extent of associations varies across Black neighborhood racial composition. We recommend some strategies for reducing inequalities based on the segmentation model within the social cohesion and public health intervention framework.","Ransome, Yusuf; Ojikutu, Bisola O; Buchanan, Morgan; Johnston, Demerise; Kawachi, Ichiro",J Urban Health,,478

Other vaccines have similar heterologous effects. This review covers molecular mechanisms behind the heterologous effects, and the potential use of heterologous vaccination in the current COVID-19 pandemic.

However, to this end accurate models are of essence that capture both the viral spread and the courses of disease in space and time at reasonable resolution. Here, we combine a spatially resolved county-level infection model for Germany with a memory-based integro-differential approach capable of directly including medical data on the course of disease, which is not possible when using traditional SIR-type models. We calibrate our model with data on cumulative detected infections and deaths from the Robert-Koch Institute and demonstrate how the model can be used to obtain county- or even city-level estimates on the number of new infections, hospitality rates and demands on intensive care units. We believe that the present work may help guide decision makers to locally fine-tune their expedient response to potential new outbreaks in the near future.","Kergaßner, Andreas; Burkhardt, Christian; Lippold, Dorothee; Kergaßner, Matthias; Pflug, Lukas; Budday, Dominik; Steinmann, Paul; Budday, Silvia",Comput Mech,,478

We describe the epidemiological and laboratory data from one of the first such outbreaks in Ontario to assess factors associated with its severity, and the impact of progressive interventions for infection control over the course of the outbreak. METHODS: We obtained line list and outbreak data from the public health unit to describe resident and staff cases, severity and distribution of cases over time and within the outbreak facility. Where available, we obtained data on laboratory specimens from the Public Health Ontario Laboratory and performed whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of viral specimens from the outbreak. RESULTS: Among 65 residents of the long-term care home, 61 (94%) contracted SARS-CoV-2, with a case fatality rate of 45% (28/61). Among 67 initial staff, 34 (51%) contracted the virus and none died. When the outbreak was declared, 12 staff, 2 visitors and 9 residents had symptoms. Resident cases were located in 3 of 4 areas of the home. Phylogenetic analysis showed tight clustering of cases, with only 1 additional strain of genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 identified from a staff case in the third week of the outbreak. No cases were identified among 26 new staff brought into the home after full outbreak measures were implemented. INTERPRETATION: Rapid and undetected viral spread in a long-term care home led to high rates of infection among residents and staff. Progressive implementation of outbreak measures after the peak of cases prevented subsequent staff cases and are now part of long-term care outbreak policy in Ontario.","Murti, Michelle; Goetz, Monika; Saunders, Andrea; Sunil, Vidya; Guthrie, Jennifer L; Eshaghi, AliReza; Zittermann, Sandra; Teatero, Sarah; Fittipaldi, Nahuel; Rilkoff, Heather; Gubbay, Jonathan B; Garber, Gary; Callery, Sandra; Holt, Anne Marie; Noseworthy, A Lynn",CMAJ,,478

The disturbing statistics of this infection promoted us to develop an effective vaccine candidate against the COVID-19. In this study, bioinformatics approaches were employed to design and introduce a novel multi-epitope vaccine against 2019-nCoV that can potentially trigger both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell immune responses and investigated its biological activities by computational tools. Three known antigenic proteins (Nucleocapsid, ORF3a, and Membrane protein, hereafter called NOM) from the virus were selected and analyzed for prediction of the potential immunogenic B and T-cell epitopes and then validated using bioinformatics tools. Based on in silico analysis, we have constructed a multi-epitope vaccine candidate (NOM) with five rich-epitopes domain including highly scored T and B-cell epitopes. After predicting and evaluating of the third structure of the protein candidate, the best 3 D predicted model was applied for docking studies with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and HLA-A*11:01. In the next step, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used to evaluate the stability of the designed fusion protein with TLR4 and HLA-A*11:01 receptors. MD studies demonstrated that the NOM-TLR4 and NOM-HLA-A*11:01 docked models were stable during simulation time. In silico evaluation showed that the designed chimeric protein could simultaneously elicit humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Determination of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at least 21 days after the RT-PCR test. Results: 126 patients were included, 33 with confirmed infection and age mean 8.4 years (95% CI 6.8-10.5) higher than not infected. Fever was the most common and with greater sensitivity. The differences found were a greater frequency of anosmia (P = .029) and headache (P = .009) among children infected with a specificity of 96.7% and 81.5% respectively. There were no differences in the duration of the symptoms. 81.8% of those infected were probably infected in the nucleus 85.2% by a parent who worked outside the home. The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 70.9% and its negative predictive value 91.1%. Conclusions: The clinical picture is nonspecific and the symptoms more specific difficult to detect in younger children. Children had a reduced role in the intrafamily transmission.

Herein, we found an enrichment of CD14highCD16- monocytes displaying inflammasome activation evidenced by caspase-1/ASC-speck formation in severe COVID-19 patients when compared to mild ones and healthy controls, respectively. Those cells also showed aberrant levels of mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX) and lipid peroxidation, both hallmarks of the oxidative stress response, which strongly correlated with caspase-1 activity. In addition, we found that NLRP3 inflammasome-derived IL-1{beta} secretion by SARS-CoV-2- exposed monocytes in vitro was partially dependent on lipid peroxidation.

342014,Clinical phenotypes of hypoxia in patients with covid-19,2021,"Consumption of contaminated meat and poultry products is a major source of foodborne illness in the United States and globally. Meat inspection procedures, established more than a hundred years ago to detect prevailing food safety issues of the time and largely harmonized around the world, do not effectively detect modern hazards and may inadvertently increase food safety risks by spreading contamination across carcasses. Visual-only inspection (VOI) is a modernized meat inspection system that is data-driven and minimizes physical manipulation of the carcass during inspection. It was developed based on scientific evidence and risk assessment and aims to better control current food safety hazards. In 2014, the European Union (EU) became the first supranational government in the world to require VOI for all swine herds slaughtered in Member States that met certain epidemiologic and animal rearing conditions. Here, we review the implementation of this new inspection system with the goal of informing similar modernization efforts in other countries and for other commodities beyond pork. This article reports the results of a literature review and interviews conducted with nine experts in 2018 on the implementation of the EU's 2014 VOI regulation. Challenges, opportunities, and lessons learned about the implementation of the regulation are described for audiences interested in adapting inspection procedures to prevent and detect modern food safety hazards. Overall, implementation of VOI varies within and across Member States, and among slaughterhouses of different sizes. This variation is due to disease risk patterns, supply chain conditions, and trade barriers. Before transitioning to a similar risk-based inspection system, other countries should consider science-based research agendas to identify what information best predicts herd health and foodborne hazards, regulatory system design that reflects local hazards, and development of targeted VOI educational materials.","Riess, Beth; Hoelzer, Karin",J. foof prot,,478

342140,Impact of smoking and tobacco use on the severity of COVID-19 infection,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Best practice approaches for addressing COVID-19-related psychological distress among young people (<25 years) and their families remain unclear. Psychological first aid (PFA) is promoted by public health authorities to provide psychological support in the context of extreme events; however, there is limited evidence for its effectiveness. As a prerequisite to conducting a randomised controlled trial to examine programme effectiveness, this project is evaluating the acceptability and feasibility of implementing and evaluating a PFA training programme ('LIVES for Families') for mental health (MH) practitioners to improve their ability to recognise and respond to COVID-19-related psychological distress among their clients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are using a triangulation mixed methods research design; complementary strands of quantitative and qualitative data are being collected in parallel and will be merged at the interpretation phase of the project. The quantitative strand uses a repeated measures design; a consecutive sample of MH practitioners (n=80) providing MH support to young people or their families are being recruited to participate in the LIVES for Families PFA training programme and complete quantitative measures at baseline (pretraining), 2-week and 6-month follow-up time points. The qualitative strand uses fundamental description and semistructured interviews with a subset of practitioners (n=30), as well as managers of MH agencies (n=20). A mixed methods joint display and associated narrative will generate a comprehensive understanding regarding acceptability and feasibility. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board approved the study (project number: 11295). Results will be shared broadly with the policy and practice community through publications, presentations and public webinars. As a brief, evidence-informed intervention, the LIVES for Families PFA training programme is suitable in its mode of delivery across care settings. The outcomes of this study could have international implications for mitigating the MH impacts of viral pandemics.","Kimber, Melissa; Harms, Sheila; Soreni, Noam; Inrig, Maggie; Acai, Anita; Lipman, Ellen Louise; Sassi, Roberto; Streiner, David L; MacMillan, Harriet L",BMJ Open,,478
342195,Race/ethnicity association with COVID-19 outcomes in rheumatic disease: Data from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance Physician Registry,2020,"BACKGROUND: Public polling indicates that vaccine uptake will be suboptimal when COVID-19 vaccines become available. Formative research seeking an understanding of weak vaccination intentions is urgently needed. METHODS: Nationwide online survey of 804 U.S. English-speaking adults. Compensated participants were recruited from the U.S. through an internet survey panel of 2.5 million residents developed by a commercial survey firm. Recruitment was based on quota sampling to produce a U.S. Census-matched sample representative of the nation with regard to region of residence, sex, and age. RESULTS: COVID-19 vaccination intentions were weak, with 14.8% of respondents being unlikely to get vaccinated and another 23.0% unsure. Intent to vaccinate was highest for men, older people, individuals who identified as white and non-Hispanic, the affluent and college-educated, Democrats, those who were married or partnered, people with pre-existing medical conditions, and those vaccinated against influenza during the 2019-2020 flu season. In a multiple linear regression, significant predictors of vaccination intent were general vaccine knowledge (ß = 0.311, p < .001), rejection of vaccine conspiracies (ß = -0.117, p = .003), perceived severity of COVID-19 (ß = 0.273, p < .001), influenza vaccine uptake (ß = 0.178, p < .001), having &#8805; 5 pre-existing conditions (ß = 0.098, p = .003), being male (ß = 0.119, p < .001), household income of &#8805; $120,000 (ß = 0.110, p = .004), identifying as a Democrat (ß = 0.075, p < .029), and not relying upon social media for virus information (ß = -0.090, p ã002). Intent to vaccinate was lower for Fox News (57.3%) than CNN/MSNBC viewers (76.4%) (&#967;2(1) = 12.68, p < .001). Political party differences in threat appraisals and vaccine conspiracy beliefs are described. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic characteristics, vaccine knowledge, perceived vulnerability to COVID-19, risk factors for COVID-19, and politics likely contribute to vaccination hesitancy.","Ruiz, Jeanette B; Bell, Robert A",Vaccine,,478
342642,Management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections and of patients with chronic lung diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic (as of 9 may 2020). (Covid-19 part I.),2020,"Violence against children occurs in all countries, affecting children of all ages, genders, race and socio-economic strata. A multiplicity of factors contributes to children's experience of violence. Social and gender norms can act as risk and protective factors exposing children to violence or preventing them from having well-being and healthy development. This Special Symposium was conceived of during the first International Viable and Operable Ideas for Child Equality (VOICE) Conference in 2018 in Bali, Indonesia. The four manuscripts in this Special Symposium illustrate with evidence the importance of social norms to preventing violence against children and the importance of understanding norms in context. The authors find that understanding how geographic location, social cohesion, group roles and identities, age and gendered expectations inform whether, when and which children experience violence, who perpetrates it, and how individuals and communities respond to it. The global COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated how rapidly behaviours can shift towards caregiving and health, as well as against it. If we are to prevent violence against children, and ensure the safety, well-being, and opportunity to thrive for all children, advancing our understanding of norms in relation to violence against children is critical to effective programming and learning.","Kohli, Anjalee; Agastya, Ni Luh Putu Maitra; Cislaghi, Ben; Schulte, Marie-Celine",Glob Public Health,,478
342825,70 Reno-Pulmonary Extracorporeal Organ Support for Severe COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: In-Vitro/Cellular evidence is the backbone and vital proof of concept during the development of novel therapeutics as well as drugs repurposing against COVID-19. Choosing an ideal in-vitro model is vital as the virus entry is through ACE2, CD147, and TMPRSS2 dependant and very specific. In this regard, this is the first systematic review addressing the importance of specific cell lines used as potential in-vitro models in the isolation, pathogenesis, and therapeutics for SARS-COV-2. METHODS: We searched 17 literature databases with appropriate keywords, and identified 1173 non-duplicate studies. In the present study, 71 articles are included after a careful, thorough screening of the titles and their abstracts for possible inclusion using predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria (PRISMA Guidelines). RESULTS: In the current study, we compiled cell culture-based studies for SARS-CoV-2 and found the best compatible In-Vitro models for SARS-CoV-2 (Vero, VeroE6, HEK293 as well as its variants, Huh-7, Calu-3 2B4, and Caco2). Among other essential cell lines used include LLC-MK2, MDCKII, BHK-21, HepG2, A549,T cell leukemia (MT-2), stems cells based cell line DYR0100for differentiation assays, and embryo-specific NIH3T3 cell line for vaccine production. CONCLUSION: The Present study provides a detailed summary of all the drugs/compounds screened for drug repurposing and discovery purpose using the in-vitro models for SARS-CoV-2 along with isolation, pathogenesis and vaccine production. This study also suggests that after careful evaluation of all the cell line based studies, Kidney cells (VeroE6, HEK293 along with their clones), liver Huh-7cells, respiratory Calu-3 cells, and intestinal Caco-2 are the most widely used in-vitro models for SARS-CoV-2.","Kumar, Subodh; Sarma, Phulen; Kaur, Hardeep; Prajapat, Manisha; Bhattacharyya, Anusuya; Avti, Pramod; Sehkhar, Nishant; Kaur, Harpinder; Bansal, Seema; Mahendiratta, Saniya; Mahalmani, Vidya M; Singh, Harvinder; Prakash, Ajay; Kuhad, Anurag; Medhi, Bikash",Tissue Cell,,478

345153,Cardiac rehabilitation and telemedicine (and COVID-19),2020,"BACKGROUND: Little is known regarding long-term outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 6-month outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients with new neurological complications during hospitalization who survived were propensity score-matched to COVID-19 survivors without neurological complications hospitalized during the same period. The primary 6-month outcome was multivariable ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin Scale(mRS) comparing patients with or without neurological complications. Secondary outcomes included: activities of daily living (ADLs;Barthel Index), telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Neuro-QoL batteries for anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep. RESULTS: Of 606 COVID-19 patients with neurological complications, 395 survived hospitalization and were matched to 395 controls; N = 196 neurological patients and N = 186 controls completed follow-up. Overall, 346/382 (91%) patients had at least one abnormal outcome: 56% had limited ADLs, 50% impaired cognition, 47% could not return to work and 62% scored worse than average on &#8805;1 Neuro-QoL scale (worse anxiety 46%, sleep 38%, fatigue 36%, and depression 25%). In multivariable analysis, patients with neurological complications had worse 6-month mRS (median 4 vs. 3 among controls, adjusted OR 1.98, 95%CI 1.23-3.48, P = 0.02), worse ADLs (aOR 0.38, 95%CI 0.29-0.74, P = 0.01) and were less likely to return to work than controls (41% versus 64%, P = 0.04). Cognitive and Neuro-QOL metrics were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in functional outcomes, ADLs, anxiety, depression and sleep occurred in over 90% of patients 6-months after hospitalization for COVID-19. In multivariable analysis, patients with neurological complications during index hospitalization had significantly worse 6-month functional outcomes than those without.","Frontera, Jennifer A; Yang, Dixon; Lewis, Ariane; Patel, Palak; Medicherla, Chaitanya; Arena, Vito; Fang, Taolin; Andino, Andres; Snyder, Thomas; Madhavan, Maya; Gratch, Daniel; Fuchs, Benjamin; Dessy, Alexa; Canizares, Melanie; Jauregui, Ruben; Thomas, Betsy; Bauman, Kristie; Olivera, Anlys; Bhagat, Dhristie; Sonson, Michael; Park, George; Stainman, Rebecca; Sunwoo, Brian; Talmasov, Daniel; Tamimi, Michael; Zhu, Yingrong; Rosenthal, Jonathan; Dygert, Levi; Ristic, Milan; Ishii, Haruki; Valdes, Eduard; Omari, Mirza; Gurin, Lindsey; Huang, Joshua; Czeisler, Barry M; Kahn, D Ethan; Zhou, Ting; Lin, Jessica; Lord, Aaron S; Melmed, Kara; Meropol, Sharon; Troxel, Andrea B; Petkova, Eva; Wisniewski, Thomas; Balcer, Laura; Morrison, Chris; Yaghi, Shadi; Galetta, Steven",J Neurol Sci,,478

BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is the betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. It was listed as a potential global health threat by WHO due to high mortality, high basic reproduction number and lack of clinically approved drugs and vaccines for COVID-19. The genomic sequence of the virus responsible for COVID-19, as well as the experimentally determined three dimensional structure of the Main protease are available. OBJECTIVE: To identify potential drugs that can be repurposed for treatment of COVID-19 by using molecular docking based virtual screening of all approved drugs. METHODS: List of drugs approved for clinical use was obtained from SuperDRUG2 database. The structure of the target in the apo form, as well as structures of several target-ligand complexes, were obtained from RCSB PDB. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro determined from X-ray diffraction data was used as the target. Data regarding drugs in clinical trials for COVID-19 was obtained from clinicaltrials.org. Input for molecular docking based virtual screening was prepared by using Obabel and customized python, bash and awk scripts. Molecular docking calculations were carried out with Vina and SMINA, and the docked conformations were analyzed and visualized with PLIP, Pymol and Rasmol. RESULTS: Among the drugs that are being tested in clinical trials for COVID-19, Danoprevir and Darunavir have the highest binding affinity for the target main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Saquinavir and Beclabuvir were identified as the best novel candidates for COVID-19 therapy by using Virtual Screening of drugs approved for other clinical indications. CONCLUSION: Protease inhibitors approved for treatment of other viral diseases have the potential to be repurposed for treatment of COVID-19.","Talluri, Sekhar",,,478

Within this context, the paper aims: (i) to analyse the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on perceived weight changes; (ii) to evaluate factors associated with the perception of weight changes (Body Mass Index (BMI), sleep quality, time spent in sedentary activities), in an Italian academic community of students and workers. A total of 3666 participants took part in this cross-sectional study (2838 students and 828 workers, of whom 73.0% were female). T-test, Chi-square test and the two-way ANOVA were used. Results showed that 43.3% of participants perceived a weight gain. Workers experienced a more substantial increase in body weight (0.7 kg) compared to students (0.3 kg; p = 0.013). A significant difference between preobese/obese workers (0.9 kg) and students (-0.3 kg; p < 0.001) was found. Overall, 57.0% of the sample was characterized by high levels of sedentary activities. Sedentary people noticed a higher weight gain (0.4 kg) compared to less sedentary people (0.3 kg; p = 0.048). More than 45% of participants reported a worsening of sleep quality and showed a perceived increase in body weight (0.5 kg) in comparison to those who improved their sleep quality (no weight change; p = 0.001). Designing tailored interventions to promote health-related behaviours during lockdown periods is essential.","Micheletti Cremasco, Margherita; Mulasso, Anna; Moroni, Alessia; Testa, Andrea; Degan, Raffaella; Rainoldi, Alberto; Rabaglietti, Emanuela",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,478
347647,COVID-19 diagnosis and management: a comprehensive review,2020,"Patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) have a two- to threefold greater risk of developing venous as well as arterial thrombotic events. Although such thrombotic events are more commonly seen during phases of active AAV, they are also recognized to occur during AAV in remission. Endothelial injury is a key pathogenic event in AAV. Endothelial injury can be caused by neutrophil activation and release of thrombogenic tissue factor into the circulation. Neutrophil activation further results in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs contribute to thrombosis by expressing tissue factor. NETs have also been detected in cutaneous thrombi from patients with AAV induced by hydralazine. Activated neutrophils in AAV patients release thrombogenic microparticles loaded with tissue factor which further enhances clotting of blood. Antiphospholipid antibodies (APLs) have been detected in up to a third of AAV and might also be induced by drugs such as cocaine adulterated with levamisole and propylthiouracil, which are known to trigger AAV. Such APLs further drive the thrombosis in AAV. Once thrombogenesis occurs, the homeostatic mechanisms resulting in clot dissolution are further impaired in AAV due to anti-plasminogen antibodies. The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with endothelial injury and NETosis, mechanisms which are in common with AAV. Reports of new-onset AAV following COVID-19 have been described in the literature, and there could be shared mechanisms driving these processes that require further evaluation.","Misra, Durga Prasanna; Thomas, Koshy Nithin; Gasparyan, Armen Yuri; Zimba, Olena",Clin. rheumatol,,478
347662,Smoking and risk of COVID-19 hospitalization,2021,"In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic experienced around the world, new student lifestyles have had an impact on their daily behavior. The purpose of this study was to examine post-traumatic stress associated with the initial COVID-19 crisis in students (N = 280) with a mean age of 13 ± 1.70 and to determine the relationship between their reported daily behaviors in terms of their gender. The study was conducted primarily in Casablanca and Marrakech, the two cities most affected by the pandemic at the time of the study in Morocco in May 2020. Our sample consists of 133 high school students and 147 middle school students, 83.6% of whom are females. Students were asked to answer questions based on an Activity Biorhythm Questionnaire, the Post-Traumatic Stress Scale (Weathers et al., 1993), the Hamilton Scale (Hamilton, 1960), the Worry Domains Questionnaire (Tallis, Eyzenck, Mathews, 1992), and the Visual Analog Scale of Moods (VASM) (Stern et al., 1997). The results obtained confirm that there is a significant relationship between the circadian rhythm of some variables and gender in some activities such as academic study (p < 0.05) and TV and Internet use (p < 0.05) and was highly significant for physical activity (p = 0.001), while others are not significant in relation to other schedules of the same variables or in relation to others. Likewise, for the psychological conditions, significant relationships with mood states and depressive tendencies were confirmed. In lockdown, the students' daily lives underwent changes in circadian rhythm and lifestyle. Therefore, it is necessary to treat their current psychological problems and avoid future complications.","Sabaoui, Ikram Lotf Said Talbi Mohammed",Education Sciences,,478

OBJECTIVE: This single centre cross-section study aimed to grade the severity of pneumonia by bed-side lung ultrasound (LUS). METHODS: A scoring system discriminates 5 levels of lung opacities: A-lines (0 points),&#8805;3 B-Line (1 point), coalescent B-Lines (2 points), marked pleural disruptions (3 points), consolidations (4 points). LUS (convex 1-5âMHz probe) was performed at 6 defined regions for each hemithorax either in supine or prone position. A lung aeration score (LAS, maximum 4 points) was allocated for each patient by calculating the arithmetic mean of the examined lung areas. Score levels were correlated with ventilation parameters and laboratory markers. RESULTS: LAS of 20 patients with ARDS reached from 2.58 to 3.83 and was highest in the lateral right lobe (Mean 3.67).

351875,Study on glycemic profiles and emotional scales in diabetic patients after the outbreak of COVID-19,2020,"Evidence strongly supports that access to specialty gastroenterology or hepatology care in cirrhosis is associated with higher adherence to guideline-recommended care and improves clinical outcomes. Presently, only about one half of acute care hospitalizations for cirrhosis-related complications result in inpatient specialty care, and the current hepatology workforce cannot meet the demand of patients with liver disease nationwide, particularly in less densely populated areas and in community-based practices not affiliated with academic centers. Telemedicine, defined as the delivery of health care services at a distance using electronic means for diagnosis and treatment, holds tremendous promise to increase access to broadly specialty care. The technology is cheap and easy to use, although it is presently limited in scale by interstate licensing restrictions and reimbursement barriers. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and coronavirus disease 2019 has, in the short term, accelerated the growth of telemedicine delivery as a public health and social distancing measure.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the outcomes of the use of synchronous telemedicine for outpatient consultations in a tertiary adult allergy center. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all non-face-to-face appointments during the second month of the pandemic in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: A total of 637 non-face-to-face appointments for unique patients were booked between April 1 and 30, 2020; 91% were new consultations. Most referrals (81.5%) were related to nondrug reactions. The overall ""Did Not Attend"" rate was 15.7%. A total of 439 patients were assessed for nondrug reactions; 87% were new appointments. Food-related reactions (50.4%), urticaria/angioedema (23.2%), and rhinitis (18.1%) were the most common reasons for new referrals. Two hundred twenty-one (57.7%) of these patients required further allergy testing, primarily for suspected food allergy. More than 42% of the new patients, mainly referred for urticaria/angioedema, were discharged after their remote assessment. Less than 10% of the follow-up patients required additional testing. Ninety-seven new patients were assessed for a suspected drug reaction, predominantly to beta-lactam antibiotics (57.7%). Sixty-nine patients (71%) required further investigations, but a notable 29% did not require further allergy input. The overall experience was very good/good for most patients (85%). CONCLUSION: Telemedicine can transform the current models of allergy care. Screening criteria for selecting suitable new patients are required.

States' actions to address the pandemic have varied widely, and federal and state officials have provided conflicting messages. This fragmented approach has surely cost time and lives. Federalism will shape the long-term health and economic impacts of COVID-19, including plans for the future, for at least two reasons: First, federalism exacerbates inequities, as some states have a history of underinvesting in social programs, especially in certain communities. Second, many of the states with the deepest needs are poorly equipped to respond to emergencies due to low taxes and distrust of government, leading to inadequate infrastructure. These dynamics are not new, but they have been laid bare by this crisis. What can policy makers do to address the inequities in health and economic outcomes that federalism intensifies?

The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the effectiveness of using new technologies in the rehabilitation of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and discuss their potential role during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods: The studies were identified by searching two online databases-PUBMED and Web of Science. Combinations of the key words ""Multiple sclerosis"" and ""e-health""; ""Multiple sclerosis"" and ""virtual reality""; ""Multiple sclerosis"" and ""telerehabilitation""; ""Multiple sclerosis"" and ""new technologies""; ""Multiple sclerosis"" and ""tele-exercise"" were used to find suitable publications. Results: A total of 17 studies were included. Although the overall number of participants in all the studies was 904, two of the studies were conducted on the same group. Thus, a total of 854 participants were involved in the studies included. All participants were diagnosed with MS. In 10 studies, participants had to be diagnosed according to the McDonald criteria. Of the included studies: five involved intervention at participants' home, six were conducted using Xbox Kinect, and seven studies reported no adverse outcomes. Conclusion: The review proves telerehabilitation to be an effective motivational tool to restore and maintain both physical and cognitive function in patients with MS. Remote communication technologies seem to be measures of high effectiveness in rehabilitating and supporting MS patients especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the traditional rehabilitation option is less accessible or in some cases inaccessible for these patients.","Zasadzka, Ewa; Trzmiel, Tomasz; Pieczynska, Anna; Hojan, Katarzyna",Medicina (Kaunas),,478
353194,Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The world is currently facing a novel viral pandemic (SARS-CoV-2), and large-scale testing is central to decision-making for the design of effective policies and control strategies to minimize its impact on the global population. However, testing for the presence of the virus is a major bottleneck in tracking the spreading of the disease. Given its adaptability regarding the nucleotide sequence of target regions, RT-qPCR is a strong ally to reveal the rapid geographical spreading of novel viruses. We assessed PCR variations in the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis taking into account public genome sequences and diagnosis kits used by different countries. We analyzed 226 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from samples collected by March 22, 2020. Our work utilizes a phylogenetic approach that reveals the early evolution of the virus sequence as it spreads around the globe and informs the design of RT-qPCR primers and probes. The quick expansion of testing capabilities of a country during a pandemic is largely impaired by the availability of adequately trained personnel on RNA isolation and PCR analysis, as well as the availability of hardware (thermocyclers). We propose that rapid capacity development can circumvent these bottlenecks by training medical and non-medical personnel with some laboratory experience, such as biology-related graduate students. Furthermore, the use of thermocyclers available in academic and commercial labs can be promptly calibrated and certified to properly conduct testing during a pandemic. A decentralized, fast-acting training and testing certification pipeline will better prepare us to manage future pandemics.","Barreto, Horllys Gomes; de Pádua Milagres, Flávio Augusto; de Araújo, Gessi Carvalho; Daúde, Matheus Martins; Benedito, Vagner Augusto",J Mol Med (Berl),,478

The number of deaths in the whole world has been rising rapidly. However, the early warning factors for mortality have not been well ascertained. In this retrospective, single-centre cohort study, we included some adult inpatients (&#8805;18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University who had been discharged or had died by Apr. 8, 2020. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data at admission were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable analysis, Cox proportional hazard model analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to explore the early warning factors associated with in-hospital death. A total of 159 patients were included in this study, of whom 86 were discharged and 73 died in hospital. Hypertension (52.1% vs. 29.1%, P=0.003) and coronary heart disease (28.8% vs. 12.8%, P=0.012) were more frequent among non-survived patients than among survived patients. The proportions of patients with dyspnoea (67.1% vs. 25.6%, P<0.001), chest distress (58.9% vs. 26.7%, P<0.001) and fatigue (64.4% vs. 25.6%, P<0.001) were significantly higher in the non-survived group than in the survived group. Regression analysis with the Cox proportional hazards mode revealed that increasing odds of in-hospital death were associated with higher IL-6 (odds ratio 10.87, 95% CI 1.41-83.59; P=0.022), lactate (3.59, 1.71-7.54; P=0.001), older age (1.86, 1.03-3.38; P=0.041) and lower lymphopenia (5.44, 2.71-10.93; P<0.001) at admission. The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of IL-6, lymphocyte, age and lactate were 0.933, 0.928, 0.786 and 0.753 respectively. The AUC of IL-6 was significantly higher than that of age (z=3.332, P=0.0009) and lactate (z=4.441, P<0.0001) for outcome prediction. There was no significant difference between the AUCs of IL-6 and lymphocyte for outcome prediction (z=0.372, P=0.7101). It was concluded that the potential risk factors of higher IL-6, lactate, older age and lower lymphopenia at admission could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.","Shang, Min; Wei, Jie; Zou, Han-Dong; Zhou, Qing-Shan; Zhang, Yun-Ting; Wang, Chang-Yong",Curr Med Sci,,478

METHODS: All obese inpatients recorded during a hospital stay by the French National Health Insurance were included, and their electronic health data were reviewed retrospectively. Patients who had undergone bariatric surgery comprised the BS group and patients with obesity but no history of BS served as controls. The primary outcome was COVID-19-related death and the secondary outcome was the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: 4,248,253 obese individuals aged 15-75 years were included and followed for a mean observation time of 5.43 ± 2.93 years. 8286 individuals with a previous diagnosis of obesity were admitted for COVID-19 between January 1 and May 15, 2020. Of these patients, 541 had a history of BS and 7745 did not. The need for invasive mechanical ventilation and death occurred in 7% and 3.5% of the BS group versus 15% and 14.2% of the control group, respectively. In logistic regression, the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation was independently associated with increasing age, male sex, and hypertension, and mortality was independently associated with increasing age, male sex, history of heart failure, cancer, and diabetes, whereas BS had an independent protective effect. Two random exact matching tests confirmed the protective effect of BS. CONCLUSION: This nationwide study showed that BS is independently associated with a reduced risk of death and invasive mechanical ventilation in obese individuals with COVID-19.","Iannelli, Antonio; Bouam, Samir; Schneck, Anne-Sophie; Frey, Sébastien; Zarca, Kevin; Gugenheim, Jean; Alifano, Marco",Obes. surg,,478

In response to the epidemic, a lot of important decisions need to be taken to save communities and economies worldwide. Data clearly play a vital role in effective decision-making. Data-driven decision-making uses data-related evidence and insights to guide the decision-making process and verify the plan of action before it is committed. To better handle the epidemic, governments and policy-making institutes have investigated abundant data originating from COVID-19. These data include those related to medicine, knowledge, media, and so on. Based on these data, many prevention and control policies are made. In this survey article, we summarize the progress of data-driven decision-making in the response to COVID-19, including COVID-19 prevention and control, psychological counseling, financial aid, work resumption, and school reopening. We also propose some current challenges and open issues in data-driven decision-making, including data collection and quality, complex data analysis, and fairness in decision-making. This survey article sheds light on current policy-making driven by data, which also provides a feasible direction for further scientific research.

356627,Geographic Differences in Lung Transplant Volume and Donor Availability During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The number of sunspots shows the solar activity level. During the high solar activity, emissions of matter and electromagnetic fields from the Sun make it difficult for cosmic rays to penetrate the Earth. When solar energy is high, cosmic ray intensity is lower, so that the solar magnetic field and solar winds affect the Earth externally and originate new viruses. In this paper, we assess the possible effects of sunspot numbers on the world virus appearance. The literature has no sufficient results about these phenomena. Therefore, we try to relate solar ray extremum to virus generation and the history of pandemics. First, wavelet decomposition is used for smoothing the sunspot cycle to predict past pandemics and forecast the future time of possible virus generation. Finally, we investigate the geographical appearance of the virus in the world to show vulnerable places in the world. The result of the analysis of pandemics that occurred from 1750 to 2020 shows that world's great viral pandemics like COVID-19 coincide with the relative extrema of sunspot number. Based on our result, 27 pandemic (from 36) incidences are on sunspot extrema. Then, we forecast future pandemics in the world for about 110 years or 10 cycles using presented multi-step autoregression (MSAR). To confirm these phenomena and the generation of new viruses because of solar activity, researchers should carry out experimental studies.","Nasirpour, Mohammad Hossein; Sharifi, Abbas; Ahmadi, Mohsen; Jafarzadeh Ghoushchi, Saeid",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,478

357132,The effect of COVID-19 pandemic on daily oncology clinical practice,2021,"The studies claim that COVID-19 has positive impacts on the environment because it minimizes air pollution, water pollution, and noise pollution due to lockdown. On the contrary, COVID-19 is harming the environment due to increased medical wastage. COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Due to the exponential growth of COVID-19 cases people using large quantities of medical accessories to shield themselves from coronavirus, a large amount of medical wastage is produced per day. This medical wastage is a major concern for the expert because this medical waste is not adequately handled. The early detection of the COVID patient is the only solution to control this coronavirus. Several COVID detection models have been proposed in the last few months. Most of the existing models have a high false-positive rate where COVID patients are classified as healthy. To address this problem, this paper explores the positive and negative environmental consequences of COVID-19 and suggests a novel method based on artificial intelligence (AI) to identify COVID-19 disease. A comparative analysis of different previously trained models such as Visual Geometry Group Network (VGGNet-19), Residual Network (ResNet50), and Inception ResNet V2 is presented in this paper. Experimental results show that Inception_ResNet_V2 is a better choice for COVID detection. It has a minimal false-positive rate and offers 99.26% and 94% higher training and test accuracy compared to VGGNet and ResNet, respectively.

358225,Neurosensory dysphagia in a COVID-19 patient,2021,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety profiles of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with cancer is unknown. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine in patients with cancer. METHODS: For this prospective observational study, we recruited patients with cancer and healthy controls (mostly health-care workers) from three London hospitals between Dec 8, 2020, and Feb 18, 2021. Participants who were vaccinated between Dec 8 and Dec 29, 2020, received two 30 µg doses of BNT162b2 administered intramuscularly 21 days apart; patients vaccinated after this date received only one 30 µg dose with a planned follow-up boost at 12 weeks. Blood samples were taken before vaccination and at 3 weeks and 5 weeks after the first vaccination. Where possible, serial nasopharyngeal real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) swab tests were done every 10 days or in cases of symptomatic COVID-19. The coprimary endpoints were seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in patients with cancer following the first vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine and the effect of vaccine boosting after 21 days on seroconversion. All participants with available data were included in the safety and immunogenicity analyses. Ongoing follow-up is underway for further blood sampling after the delayed (12-week) vaccine boost. This study is registered with the NHS Health Research Authority and Health and Care Research Wales (REC ID 20/HRA/2031). FINDINGS: 151 patients with cancer (95 patients with solid cancer and 56 patients with haematological cancer) and 54 healthy controls were enrolled. For this interim data analysis of the safety and immunogenicity of vaccinated patients with cancer, samples and data obtained up to March 19, 2021, were analysed. After exclusion of 17 patients who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (detected by either antibody seroconversion or a positive rRT-PCR COVID-19 swab test) from the immunogenicity analysis, the proportion of positive anti-S IgG titres at approximately 21 days following a single vaccine inoculum across the three cohorts were 32 (94%; 95% CI 81-98) of 34 healthy controls; 21 (38%; 26-51) of 56 patients with solid cancer, and eight (18%; 10-32) of 44 patients with haematological cancer. 16 healthy controls, 25 patients with solid cancer, and six patients with haematological cancer received a second dose on day 21. Of the patients with available blood samples 2 weeks following a 21-day vaccine boost, and excluding 17 participants with evidence of previous natural SARS-CoV-2 exposure, 18 (95%; 95% CI 75-99) of 19 patients with solid cancer, 12 (100%; 76-100) of 12 healthy controls, and three (60%; 23-88) of five patients with haematological cancers were seropositive, compared with ten (30%; 17-47) of 33, 18 (86%; 65-95) of 21, and four (11%; 4-25) of 36, respectively, who did not receive a boost. The vaccine was well tolerated; no toxicities were reported in 75 (54%) of 140 patients with cancer following the first dose of BNT162b2, and in 22 (71%) of 31 patients with cancer following the second dose. Similarly, no toxicities were reported in 15 (38%) of 40 healthy controls after the first dose and in five (31%) of 16 after the second dose. Injection-site pain within 7 days following the first dose was the most commonly reported local reaction (23 [35%] of 65 patients with cancer; 12 [48%] of 25 healthy controls). No vaccine-related deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION: In patients with cancer, one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine yields poor efficacy. Immunogenicity increased significantly in patients with solid cancer within 2 weeks of a vaccine boost at day 21 after the first dose. These data support prioritisation of patients with cancer for an early (day 21) second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine.

Similarly, no toxicities were reported in 15 (38%) of 40 healthy controls after the first dose and in five (31%) of 16 after the second dose. Injection-site pain within 7 days following the first dose was the most commonly reported local reaction (23 [35%] of 65 patients with cancer; 12 [48%] of 25 healthy controls). No vaccine-related deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION: In patients with cancer, one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine yields poor efficacy. Immunogenicity increased significantly in patients with solid cancer within 2 weeks of a vaccine boost at day 21 after the first dose. These data support prioritisation of patients with cancer for an early (day 21) second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine.

358630,Structured reporting in portable chest radiographs: An essential tool in the diagnosis of COVID-19,2020,"Purpose: To test whether mice with microfibril deficiency due to the Tsk mutation of fibrillin-1 (Fbn1Tsk/+) have increased susceptibility to pressure-induced retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration. Methods: Intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation was induced in Fbn1Tsk/+ and wild type (wt) mice by injecting microbeads into the anterior chamber. Mice were then followed up for four months, with IOP measurements every three to six days. Retinas were stained for Brn3a to determine RGC number. Optic nerve cross-sections were stained with p-phenylene diamine to determine nerve area, axon number, and caliber and thickness of the pia mater. Results: Microbead injection induced significant IOP elevation that was significantly less for Fbn1Tsk/+ mice compared with wt. The optic nerves and optic nerve axons were larger, and the elastic fiber-rich pia mater was thinner in Fbn1Tsk/+ mice. Microbead injection resulted in reduced optic nerve size, thicker pia mater, and a slight decrease in axon size. Fbn1Tsk/+ mice had significantly greater loss of RGCs and optic nerve axons compared with wt (14.8% vs. 5.8%, P = 0.002, and 17.0% vs. 7.5%, P = 0.002, respectively). Conclusions: Fbn1Tsk/+mice had altered optic nerve structure as indicated by larger optic nerves, larger optic nerve axons and thinner pia mater, consistent with our previous findings. Despite lower IOP elevation, Fbn1Tsk/+mice had greater loss of RGCs and optic nerve axons, suggesting increased susceptibility to IOP-induced optic nerve degeneration in microfibril-deficient mice.","Wu, Hang-Jing; Kuchtey, John; Kuchtey, Rachel W",Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,,478

The current unprecedent outbreak SARS-COV-2 is prompting a search for new cost-effective therapies to combat this deadly pathogen. Suitably functionalized polysubstituted quinoxalines show very interesting biological properties (antiviral, anticancer, and antileishmanial), ensuring them a bright future in medicinal chemistry. OBJECTIVES: Focusing on the promising development of new quinoxaline derivatives as antiviral drugs, this review forms part of our program on the anti-infectious activity of quinoxaline derivatives. METHODS: Study compiles and discusses recently published studies concerning the therapeutic potential of the antiviral activity of quinoxaline derivatives, covering the literature between 2010 and 2020. RESULTS: A final total of 20 studies included in this review. CONCLUSIONS: This review points to a growing interest in the development of compounds bearing a quinoxaline moiety for antiviral treatment. This promising moiety with different molecular targets warrants further investigation, which may well yield even more encouraging results regarding this scaffold.","Montana, Marc; Montero, Vincent; Khoumeri, Omar; Vanelle, Patrice",Molecules (Basel),,478

However, the ability of broilers to respond to three or four different antigenic types of IBV vaccine has not been examined experimentally. In this study, we vaccinated one-day-old broiler chicks by eyedrop with three or four different IBV vaccine types simultaneously. The presence and relative amount of each vaccine was examined in all of the birds by IBV type-specific real-time RT-PCR at 5 days post-vaccination and each vaccine was detected in all of the birds given that vaccine. The birds were challenged at 28 days of age and protection was measured by clinical signs, virus detection and by ciliostasis. Birds vaccinated with three different IBV types (Ark, Mass and GA98) were protected against challenge with each of those IBV types and were partially protected against challenge with the GA08 virus. Birds vaccinated with four different IBV types (Ark, Mass, GA98 and GA08) were protected against challenge with each of those IBV types with the exception of Mass challenged birds which clearly had 3/11 birds not protected based on individual ciliostasis scores, but had an average ciliostasis score of >50% which is considered protected. The results are important for the control of IBV because they indicate that simultaneous vaccination with up to four different IBV vaccine types can provide adequate protection against challenge for each type.","Jackwood, Mark W; Clark, Randi; Cheng, Sunny; Jordan, Brian J",Avian Pathol,,478
361195,Reduced Fractionation in Lung Cancer Patients Treated with Curative-intent Radiotherapy during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) is a composite score which can detect the first signs of cognitive impairment, which can be of importance for research and clinical practice. It is designed to be administered in person; however, in-person assessments are costly, and are difficult during the current COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of performing the PACC assessment with videoconferencing, and to compare the validity of this remote PACC with the in-person PACC obtained previously. METHODS: Participants from the HEalth and Ageing Data IN the Game of football (HEADING) Study who had already undergone an in-person assessment were re-contacted and re-assessed remotely. The correlation between the two PACC scores was estimated. The difference between the two PACC scores was calculated and used in multiple linear regression to assess which variables were associated with a difference in PACC scores. FINDINGS: Of the 43 participants who were invited to this external study, 28 were re-assessed. The median duration in days between the in-person and the remote assessments was 236.5 days (7.9 months) (IQR 62.5). There was a strong positive correlation between the two assessments for the PACC score, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0·82 (95% CI 0·66, 0·98). The multiple linear regression found that the only predictor of the PACC difference was the time between assessments. INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence on the feasibility of performing cognitive tests online, with the PACC tests being successfully administered through videoconferencing. This is relevant, especially during times when face-to-face assessments cannot be performed.","Seghezzo, Giulia; Van Hoecke, Yvonne; James, Laura; Davoren, Donna; Williamson, Elizabeth; Pearce, Neil; McElvenny, Damien; Gallo, Valentina",J. neurol,,478

The inventory of Rh and K antigen-negative red cell units recommended for patients with hemoglobinopathies became alarmingly low and continues to be strained. Because patients with sickle cell disease requiring chronic red cell exchange (RCE) incur a large demand for red cell units, we hypothesized that implementation of 2 measures could reduce blood use. First, obtaining the pretransfusion hemoglobin S (HbS) results by procedure start time would facilitate calculation of exact red cell volume needed to achieve the desired post-RCE HbS. Second, as a short-term conservation method, we identified patients for whom increasing the targeted end procedure hematocrit up to 5 percentage points higher than the pretransfusion level (no higher than 36%) was not medically contraindicated. The goal was to enhance suppression of endogenous erythropoiesis and thereby reduce the red cell unit number needed to maintain the same target HbS%. These 2 measures resulted in an 18% reduction of red cell units transfused to 50 patients undergoing chronic RCE during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite reduction of blood use, pretransfusion HbS% target goals were maintained and net iron accumulation was low. Both strategies can help alleviate a shortage of Rh and K antigen-negative red cells, and, more generally, transfusing red cell units based on precise red cell volume required can optimize patient care and judicious use of blood resources.","Uter, Stacey; An, Hyun Hyung; Linder, Grace E; Kadauke, Stephan; Sesok-Pizzini, Deborah; Kim, Haewon C; Friedman, David F; Chou, Stella T",Blood Adv,,478

362656,Warfarin-Induced Calciphylaxis in a COVID-19 Patient,2020,"AimsOut-of-hours (‘on-call’) work can be perceived by junior doctors to be a daunting experience, associated with feeling unprepared and less supported. Simulated on-call programmes have been used to great effect in medicine and surgery to improve junior doctors’ skills in task prioritisation, interpersonal communication and confidence on-call. However, few psychiatry-specific programmes exist.We aimed to: i) Develop a psychiatry specific virtual-on-call programme, ii) Investigate if the virtual-on-call programme improved confidence amongst junior trainees in key areas of psychiatry practice.MethodThe Psychiatry Virtual-On-Call programme commenced in December 2020. It involves attending an introductory on-call lecture, followed later in the rotation by a 2-hour simulated on-call shift. All trainees are expected to attend during their attachment and the simulated shifts are ongoing. During the shift, trainees are ‘bleeped’ with different psychiatry specific tasks. They work through the tasks, using local intranet policies and telephone advice from the on-call psychiatry registrar. Due to COVID-19 the sessions were delivered virtually. Participants completed a questionnaire evaluating confidence in ten domains, rated on a Likert scale from 0–10. Questionnaires were completed at four time-points during the programme;pre- and post-introductory lecture and pre- and post-simulated shift. Scores were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests. Significance was defined as P &lt; 0.05 with Bonferroni correction applied for multiple testing.ResultTwenty-nine trainees attended the introductory lecture, 25 and 21 trainees completed the pre- and post-lecture questionnaire respectively. A non-significant improvement in confidence was reported in three domains: seclusions reviews, prescribing, detention under the mental health act.At the time of writing, ten trainees had attended the on-call shift. All participants completed a pre- and post-session questionnaire. The on-call shift was a useful learning experience (median score 9), and significantly increased perceived preparedness for on-call work from 3/10 to 7/10 (p &lt; 0.001). Confidence was significantly improved in seven domains, most markedly in seclusion reviews, prescribing and mental health act tasks.ConclusionThe psychiatry virtual-on-call programme fills a niche in the training curriculum and is perceived by trainees to be a useful learning experience. The introductory lecture improved confidence in several domains, but not as effectively as the on-call shift. The on-call shift was well received by participants and significantly improved confidence in 7/10 domains. In summary, the virtual-on-call experience improves preparedness for out-of-hours psychiatry work. Follow-up of participants at the end of their psychiatry rotation will ascertain if they felt the programme to be useful during out-of-hours work.","Harrison, Charlotte Blamey Helen Roddick Alistair Saunders Kate Malhotra Tina",BJPsych Open,,478
362675,Metabolic Syndrome and COVID 19: Endocrine-Immune-Vascular Interactions Shapes Clinical Course,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Strategic planning for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) care has dominated the agenda of medical services, which have been further restricted by the need for minimizing viral transmission. Risk is particularly relevant in relation to endoscopy procedures. This study aimed to describe a contingency plan for a tertiary academic cancer center, define a strategy to prioritize and postpone examinations, and evaluate the infection rate among healthcare workers (HCWs) in the endoscopy unit of the Cancer Institute of the State of São Paulo (ICESP). METHODS: We created a strategy to balance the risk of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and to mitigate the effects of postponing endoscopic procedures in oncological patients. A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on all endoscopies between March and June 2020 compared with those during the same period in 2019 was carried out. All HCWs were interviewed to obtain clinical data and SARS-CoV-2 test results. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, there was a reduction of 55% in endoscopy cases in total. Colonoscopy was the most affected modality. The total infection rate among all HCWs was 38%. None of the senior digestive endoscopists had COVID-19. However, all bronchoscopists had been infected. One of three fellows had a serological diagnosis of COVID-19. Two-thirds of all nurses were infected, whereas half of all technicians were infected. CONCLUSIONS: In this pandemic scenario, all endoscopy services must prioritize the procedures that will be performed. It was possible to maintain some endoscopic procedures, including those meant to provide nutritional access, tissue diagnosis, and endoscopic resection. Personal protective equipment (PPE) seems effective in preventing transmission of COVID-19 from patients to digestive endoscopists. These measures can be useful in planning, even for pandemics in the future.","Pombo, Amanda A.M.; Lenz, Luciano; Paulo, Gustavo A.; Santos, Mônica A.; Tamae, Patricia K.; Santos, Alisson L.D.R.; Rezende, Daniel T.; Martins, Bruno; Kawaguti, Fabio S.; Pennachi, Caterina M.P.S.; Gusmon-Oliveira, Carla C.; Uemura, Ricardo S.; Geiger, Sebastian; Lima, Marcelo S.; Baba, Elisa R.; Figueiredo, Viviane R.; Safatle-Ribeiro, Adriana; Maluf-Filho, Fauze; Ribeiro-Júnior, Ulysses",Clinics,,478

In the current study, a novel ""symptomics"" approach was employed to examine the association between acute transdiagnostic symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and burnout and work and relationship difficulties in FHCWs at an urban tertiary care hospital in New York City. METHODS: Symptoms of COVID-19-related PTSD (4-item PTSD Checklist-5), MDD (Patient Health Questionnaire-8), GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), burnout (Single-Item Mini-Z Burnout Assessment), and functional difficulties (Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning) were assessed. Relative importance analyses were conducted to identify PTSD, MDD, and GAD symptoms associated with burnout and functional difficulties. RESULTS: The total number of eligible participants included 6,026 presumed FHCWs, of which 3,360 (55.8%) completed the survey and 2,579 (76.8%) of whom endorsed directly treating patients with COVID-19 and provided sufficient responses to our outcome variables for analysis. Feeling tired/having little energy, being easily annoyed or irritable, and feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge were most strongly associated with burnout; feeling tired/having little energy accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (> 15%). Negative expectations of oneself or the world, trouble concentrating, and feeling easily annoyed or irritable were most strongly associated with work difficulties; negative expectations of oneself or the world accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (> 9%). Feeling easily annoyed or irritable, negative expectations about oneself or the world, and feeling bad about oneself were most strongly associated with relationship difficulties; feeling easily annoyed or irritable accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (> 10%). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study underscore the importance of a transdiagnostic, symptom-based approach when examining associations between acute psychopathology and burnout and functional difficulties in FHCWs. Further work is needed to determine if early interventions aimed at ameliorating specific psychiatric symptoms may help mitigate risk for peri- and posttraumatic burnout and functional difficulties in this population.","Kachadourian, Lorig K; Feder, Adriana; Murrough, James W; Feingold, Jordyn H; Kaye-Kauderer, Halley; Charney, Dennis; Southwick, Steven M; Peccoralo, Lauren; Ripp, Jonathan; Pietrzak, Robert H",J. clin. psychiatr,,478

363695,"Covid-19: Patients should self-isolate for two weeks before elective care, trusts are told",2020,"A novel luminol electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing platform was developed based on the closed indium tin oxide bipolar electrode (ITO BPE) for detecting the biomarkers of squamous cell carcinomas named cytokeratin 19 fragments (CYFRA 21-1). A strategy of in situ-generated coreactant H2O2 and O2 was proposed to enhance luminol ECL intensity. CaO2, possessing a high capacity of self-supplying H2O2 and O2, was encapsulated by ZIF-67, glucose oxidase, and horseradish peroxidase (GOD/HRP-loaded ZIF-67@CaO2). In the presence of glucose, gluconic acid and H2O2 were generated via the catalytic effect of GOD; then, gluconic acid induced the degradation of ZIF-67, leading to the hydrolysis of the unprotected CaO2 to produce both O2 and H2O2. Therefore, the generated coreactants O2 and H2O2, via the oxidation of glucose and the hydrolysis of CaO2, can effectively enhance the luminol ECL behavior. According to the luminol ECL reaction occurring on the anode surface of the ITO BPE, a sandwich immunosensor was fabricated on the anodic ITO BPE and GOD/HRP-loaded ZIF-67@CaO2 as labels incubated with secondary antibodies. Owing to the cathodic reaction rate influencing the anodic reaction rate, Au nanoparticles were electrodeposited on the cathode surface of the ITO BPE, which not only meliorated oxygen reduction but also further enhanced the ECL intensity of luminol. Under optimal experiments, an ECL immunosensor for detecting CYFRA 21-1 with a wider linear range from 0.0075 to 50 ng mL-1 and a detection limit of 1.89 pg mL-1 (S/N = 3) was obtained.","Li, Xiaojian; Du, Yu; Wang, Huan; Ma, Hongmin; Wu, Dan; Ren, Xiang; Wei, Qin; Xu, Jing-Juan",Anal. chem,,478

However, reversible hydrogel adhesives that can be used for gelid conditions were rarely reported. In this work, we have developed a freezing-tolerant (freezing temperature < -50 °C), ultra-stretchable (stretch strain > 30000% at 25 °C) glycerol-ionic hydrogel via the ultraviolet curing of acrylamide monomer and hyper-branched polyethylenimine polymer in CaCl2-water-glycerol solution. The fabricated hydrogel exhibited reversible gelid adhesion, rapid self-healing (recover in 3 s) and weight-retaining (>2 weeks) properties. The hydrogel allows two iron substrates to adhere together at -40 °C with the lap-shear adhesion strength as high as ~1 MPa. Such strong adhesion measured was reversible, specifically achieving ~100% of initial adhesion strength at 25 °C and ~36% at -40 °C. Additionally, decreasing the testing temperature significantly improved the tensile strength but decreased the fracture strain of the hydrogel. Interestingly, lap-shear adhesion tests suggested that the gelid adhesion strength was enhanced by 130 times as the testing temperature decreased from 25 °C to -40 °C, which was mainly attributed to the enhanced mechanical strength of the bulk hydrogel as well as the increased surface interaction at gel-substrate interfaces. More importantly, the adhesion failure gradually changed from cohesive failure to adhesive failure as the temperature decreased. This work provides new practical and fundamental insights into developing multifunctional freezing-tolerant hydrogel adhesive for gelid conditions.","Yan, Yonggan; Huang, Jun; Qiu, Xiaoyong; Cui, Xin; Xu, Shulei; Wu, Xunwei; Yao, Peng; Huang, Chuanzhen",J Colloid Interface Sci,,478

Therefore, the exploration of prognostic predictors for patients with COVID-19 is vital for prompt clinical intervention. Our study aims to explore the predictive value of hematological parameters in the prognosis of patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: Ninety-eight patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at Jingzhou Central Hospital and Central Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei Province, were included in this study. Results: The median age of the patients was 59 [28-80] years; the median age of patients with a good prognosis was 56 [28-79] years, and the median age of patients with a poor outcome was 67 [35-80] years. The patients in the poor outcome group were older than the patients in the good outcome group (P<0.05). The comparison of hematological parameters showed that lymphocyte count (Lym#), red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) were significantly lower in the poor outcome group than in the good outcome group (P<0.05). Further, the red cell volume distribution width-CV (RDW-CV) and red cell volume distribution width-SD (RDW-SD) were significantly higher in the poor outcome group than in the good outcome group (P<0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed RDW-SD, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.870 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.796-0.943], was the most significant single parameter for predicting the prognosis of severe patients. When the cut-off value was 42.15, the sensitivity and specificity of RDW-SD for predicting the prognosis of severe patients were 73.1% and 80.2%, respectively. Reticulocyte (RET) channel results showed the RET level was significantly higher in critical patients than in moderate patients and severe patients (P<0.05), which may be one cause of the elevated RDW in patients with a poor outcome. Conclusions: In this study, the hematological parameters of COVID-19 patients were statistically analyzed. RDW was found to be a prognostic predictor for patients with severe COVID-19, and the increase in RET may contribute to elevated RDW.","Wang, Changzheng; Zhang, Hongmei; Cao, Xiaocui; Deng, Rongrong; Ye, Yi; Fu, Zhongxiao; Gou, Liyao; Shao, Feng; Li, Jin; Fu, Weiyang; Zhang, Xiaomei; Ding, Xiao; Xiao, Jianping; Wu, Chuanjian; Li, Tao; Qi, Huan; Li, Chengbin; Lu, Zhongxin",Ann Transl Med,,478

Methods: A total of 357 international students from 62 countries (236 in the host country and 121 in the home country) completed an online questionnaire survey 2 months after transition to online learning. We studied students' levels of loneliness, life and academic satisfaction, acculturative stress, academic adjustment, performance, loyalty, and perceptions of the online learning experience. Results: The country-of-residence variable had no statistically significant effects on most psychological and academic variables. Significant effects were observed only for two academic variables. Specifically, students who returned to the home country found online communication with other students more contributing to their online learning experience and exhibited higher academic adjustment than students who remained in the host country. This suggests the positive influence of (peer and familial) support on online learning experience from the home country. Furthermore, a significant difference in experiencing acculturative stress occurred for students in quarantine/self-isolation in the host country, which expands prior literature on the disruptive effects of social distancing on students' mental health. Finally, this study confirmed the expected increased levels of loneliness among self-isolating students in both countries, hence extending prior results to the home- and host-country contexts. No relationship between self-isolation and students' life or academic satisfaction was found, which is explained by the specific nature of the learning-from-home experience.","Wilczewski, M.; Gorbaniuk, O.; Giuri, P.",Front Psychol,,478

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a major problem with rising prevalence in the western world. Hypertension is also a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Self-report, remotely from the clinic, becomes even more essential when patients are encouraged to avoid visiting the clinic as during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-reporting of height and weight is suspected of leading to underestimation of obesity prevalence in the population; however, it has not been well studied in the elderly population.The Health Belief Model tries to predict and explain decision making of patients based on the patient's health beliefs. METHODS: Residents of a retirement home network filled a questionnaire about their health beliefs regarding hypertension and obesity and self-reported their height, weight, and blood pressure. Blood pressure, height, and weight were then measured and compared to the patients' self-reporting. FINDINGS: Ninety residents, aged 84.90 ± 5.88, filled the questionnaire. From a clinical perspective, the overall gap between the measured and the self-reported BMI (M = 1.43, SD = 2.72), which represents an absolute gap of 0.74 kilograms and 2.95 centimeters, is expected to have only a mild influence on the physician's clinical evaluation of the patient's medical condition. This can allow the physician to estimate their patient's BMI status before the medical consultation and physical examination upon the patient's self-reporting. Patients' dichotomous (normal/abnormal) self-report of their blood pressure condition was relatively credible: positive predictive value (PPV) of 77.78% for normal blood pressure (BP) and 78.57% for abnormal BP. The relatively high PPV of BP self-reporting demonstrates an option for the physician to recognize patients at risk. Regression analysis found no correlation between the anthropometric parameters and the Health Belief Model.","Amster, Roi; Reychav, Iris; McHaney, Roger; Zhu, Lin; Azuri, Joseph",Prim Health Care Res Dev,,478

We have an idea of what doctors, nurses, teachers, among many of the other professions, do for the general public, but one may ask whether there is something substantial that philosophers and ethicists can offer in these circumstances. The thesis of this paper is that the stoic attitude towards times of trouble and the pragmatist way of finding out what is possible to elevate the quality of living against all odds, if skilfully interwoven, could be an important tool in keeping mental health in good shape and, additionally, could contribute to the cultural scene at large. If this is the case, stoic pragmatists can indeed offer an interesting example of practical philosophy for many audiences, especially during the pandemic lockdown and, perhaps, for other serious difficulties or problems. To be effective in delivering their message, stoic pragmatists, as most with philosophers today, should enrich their textual and oral modes of traditional transmission of knowledge and become digital-culture public intellectuals that can recognize and reach more general audiences by, among other things, visual modes of digital communication. © 2021 Krzysztof Piotr Skowroński, published by Sciendo 2021.","Skowroński, K.

Exercise training is now a strategy that is commonly recommended for management of MS in clinical practice. Yet, there are still many opportunities for expanding the breadth and strength of research on exercise training in MS. AREAS COVERED: This paper provides the authors' perspective on eight emerging areas of research involving exercise and physical activity behavior in persons living with MS. Those areas include behavior change interventions, research across the activity continuum, telerehabilitation, neuroplasticity, heterogeneity of outcomes, inclusion of targeted samples, combined interventions involving exercise training, and multi-site trials. EXPERT OPINION: Additional research addressing those areas will greatly expand the opportunity for translation of exercise and physical activity into the clinical care of persons with MS.","Motl, Robert W; Sandroff, Brian M",Expert Rev Neurother,,478

Records of patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were reviewed retrospectively from 24 January 2020 to 15 March 2020. Patients were classified into common and severe groups according to the diagnostic criteria of severe pneumonia. The quantitative CT features of lung lesions were automatically calculated using artificial intelligence algorithms, and the percentages of ground-glass opacity volume (PGV), consolidation volume (PCV) and total lesion volume (PTV) were determined in both lungs. PGV, PCV and PTV were analyzed based on the time from the onset of initial symptoms in the common and severe groups. In the common group, PTV increased slowly and peaked at approximately 12 days from the onset of the initial symptoms. In the severe group, PTV peaked at approximately 17 days. The severe pneumonia group exhibited increased PGV, PCV and PTV compared with the common group. These features started to appear in Stage 2 (4-7 days from onset of initial symptoms) and were observed in all subsequent stages (p<0.05). In severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients, PGV, PCV and PTV began to significantly increase in Stage 2 and decrease in Stage 5 (22-30 days). Compared with common SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients, the patients in the severe group exhibited increased PGV, PCV and PTV as well as a later peak time of lesion and recovery time.","Zhang, Yue; Liu, Ying; Gong, Honghan; Wu, Lin",PLoS One,,478

We investigated the association between IFN-&#945;-2b and the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 1401 patients were enrolled, with 852 (60.8%) patients receiving 5 000 000 U of IFN-&#945;-2b via aerosol inhalation twice daily. The primary outcome was a composite measure consisting of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. A subgroup analysis was performed to investigate the impact of the IFN-&#945;-2b initiation schedule on symptom onset. RESULTS: The risk probability for crude endpoints was lower in the IFN-&#945;-2b group (3.8%) than in the non-IFN-&#945;-2b group (9.3%, P < .001). After adjusting the confounding factors, IFN-&#945;-2b therapy achieved a reduction of 64% in occurrence of endpoint events (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.62). In the subgroup analysis, compared with patients who received IFN-&#945;-2b treatment 0-2 days after symptom onset, the hazard ratio for endpoints was 2.2 (95% CI, 0.43-11.13) in patients who received the therapy 3-5 days after symptom onset, 5.89 (95% CI, 0.99-35.05) in patients who received the therapy 6-8 days after symptom onset, and remained at a high level thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-&#945;-2b aerosol inhalation therapy may be associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19, and delayed IFN-&#945;-2b intervention was associated with increased probabilities of risk events. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to validate the preliminary findings of this study.","Yu, Jiong; Lu, Xuan; Tong, Ling; Shi, Xiaowei; Ma, Jing; Lv, Feifei; Wu, Jian; Pan, Qiaoling; Yang, Jinfeng; Cao, Hongcui; Li, Lanjuan",,,478

The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to emerging SARS-CoV-2 rose concern about the eventuality of IPA complicating COVID-19 in intensive care unit mechanically-ventilated patients. While the association between severe influenza and IPA has been demonstrated, it remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 infection represents a specific risk factor for IPA. A variable incidence of such complication has been previously reported, which can be partly attributed to differences in diagnostic strategy and IPA definitions, and possibly local environmental/epidemiological factors. In this article, we discuss the similarities and differences between influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) and COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). Compared to IAPA, the majority of CAPA cases have been classified as putative rather than proven/probable IPA, in the absence of positive serum galactomannan or histopathologic evidence of angio-invasion. Discrimination between Aspergillus airways colonization and CAPA is difficult. Distinct physiopathology and cytokine profiles of influenza and COVID-19 may explain these discrepancies. Whether CAPA represents a distinct entity is still debatable and many questions remain unanswered, such as its actual incidence, the predisposing role of corticosteroids or immunomodulatory drugs, and the indications for antifungal therapy.","Lamoth, Frederic; Lewis, Russell E; Walsh, Thomas J; Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P",J. infect. dis,,478

374370,Should We Mandate a COVID-19 Vaccine for Children?,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Since the first case of the pneumonia caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is found in Wuhan, there have been more than 70,000 cases reported in China. This study aims to perform the meta-analysis of risk factors for the case fatality rate (CFR) of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). DESIGN AND METHODS: We have searched PubMed, Google scholar and medRxiv for the cohort studies involving risk factors for the CFR of COVID-19. This meta-analysis compares the risk factors of CFR between fatal patients and non-fatal patients. RESULTS: Two cohort studies are included in this study. After comparing the patients between fatal cases and non-fatal cases, several important factors are found to significantly increase the CFR in patients with COVID-19, and include the age ranging 60-70 (OR = 1.85; 95% CI = 1.62 to 2.11; P < .00001) and especially&#8805;70 (OR = 8.45; 95% CI = 7.47 to 9.55; P < .00001), sex of male (OR = 1.88; 95% CI = 1.30 to 2.73; P = .0008), occupation of retirees (OR = 4.27; 95% CI = 2.50 to 7.28; P < .00001), and severe cases (OR = 691.76; 95% CI = 4.82 to 99,265.63; P = .01). As the advancement of early diagnosis and treatment, the CFR after January 21 (or 22), 2020 is substantially decreased in COVID-19 than before (OR = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.24; P < .00001). CONCLUSIONS: Several factors are confirmed to significantly improve the CFR in patients with COVID-19, which is very important for the treatment and good prognosis of these patients.","Zhao, Jinqiu; Li, Xiaosong; Huang, Wenxiang; Zheng, Junyi",Am. j. emerg. med,,478

In this paper, we perform an empirical study of a Chinese historical text, Records of the Three Kingdoms (\textit{Records}), and a historical novel of the same story, Romance of the Three Kingdoms (\textit{Romance}). We employ natural language processing techniques to extract characters and their relationships. Then, we characterize the social networks and sentiments of the main characters in the historical text and the historical novel. We find that the social network in \textit{Romance} is more complex and dynamic than that of \textit{Records}, and the influence of the main characters differs. These findings shed light on the different styles of storytelling in the two literary genres and how the historical novel complicates the social networks of characters to enrich the literariness of the story.","Zhang, Chenhan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10835v1.pdf,478

While everyone has been striving very hard to combat the pandemic, some healthcare professionals have shown varying degrees of infection symptoms and even died. The Chinese Army Medical Aid Team arrived in Wuhan on January 25, 2020, and quickly entered the battle against the pandemic after a short and rigorous training. As one of the earliest medical teams to enter the pandemic area, researchers have been exploring effective infection control measures that are currently in practice. Through observation and research, it has been noticed that layers of protective equipment have a hidden danger of infection while protecting the safety of the personnel. The members of each medical team have typically focused on the standard use of personal protective equipment (PPE). However, after a long period of intensive diagnosis and treatment in clinics and due to physical exertion and tiredness, problems such as improper operation are prone to occur during the tedious PPE doffing, thereby producing a relatively high risk of infection. This study primarily analyzes PPE doffing procedures, existing problems, and measures for improvement to explore methods to improve PPE donning and doffing and reduce the risk of infection.","Cheng, Lin; Chen, Lei; Xiao, Li; Zhang, Jianping; Cheng, Yilian; Zhou, Lian; Peng, Yu; Liu, Lei",Open Med.,,478

This study investigated two prognostic biomarkers, the high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), in patients with severe COVID-19 at the time of admission in the intensive care unit (ICU). Of 60 ICU patients with COVID-19 enrolled and analyzed in this prospective cohort study, 48 patients (80%) were alive at ICU discharge. HMGB1 and IL-6 plasma levels at ICU admission were elevated compared with a healthy control, both in ICU nonsurvivors and ICU survivors. HMGB1 and IL-6 plasma levels were higher in patients with a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (> 10), and the presence of septic shock or acute kidney injury. HMGB1 and IL-6 plasma levels were also higher in patients with a poor oxygenation status (PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mm Hg) and a longer duration of ventilation (> 7 days). Plasma HMGB1 and IL-6 levels at ICU admission also correlated with other prognostic markers, including the maximum neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer levels, and C-reactive protein levels. Plasma HMGB1 and IL-6 levels at ICU admission predicted ICU mortality with comparable accuracy to the SOFA score and the COVID-GRAM risk score. Higher HMGB1 and IL-6 were not independently associated with ICU mortality after adjustment for age, gender, and comorbidities in multivariate analysis models. In conclusion, plasma HMGB1 and IL6 at ICU admission may serve as prognostic biomarkers in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Sivakorn, Chaisith; Dechsanga, Jutamas; Jamjumrus, Lawan; Boonnak, Kobporn; Schultz, Marcus J; Dorndorp, Arjen M; Phumratanaprapin, Weerapong; Ratanarat, Ranistha; Naorungroj, Thummaporn; Wattanawinitchai, Patchrapa; Siripoon, Tanaya; Duangdee, Chatnapa; Techarang, Tachpon",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,478

We summarise the literature on the performance of different rapid tests for exertional desaturation and draw on this evidence base to provide guidance in the context of acute Covid-19. MAIN RESEARCH QUESTIONS: 1. What exercise tests have been used to assess exertional hypoxia at home or in an ambulatory setting in the context of Covid-19 and to what extent have they been validated? 2. What exercise tests have been used to assess exertional hypoxia in other lung conditions, to what extent have they been validated and what is the applicability of these studies to acute Covid-19? METHOD: AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE MEDLINE, Cochrane and PubMed using LitCovid, Scholar and Google databases were searched to September 2020. Studies where participants had Covid-19 or another lung disease and underwent any form of exercise test which was compared to a reference standard were eligible. Risk of bias was assessed using QUADAS 2. A protocol for the review was published on the Medrxiv database. RESULTS: Of 47 relevant papers, 15 were empirical studies, of which 11 described an attempt to validate one or more exercise desaturation tests in lung diseases other than Covid-19. In all but one of these, methodological quality was poor or impossible to fully assess. None had been designed as a formal validation study (most used simple tests of correlation). Only one validation study (comparing a 1-min sit-to-stand test [1MSTST] with reference to the 6-min walk test [6MWT] in 107 patients with interstitial lung disease) contained sufficient raw data for us to calculate the sensitivity (88%), specificity (81%) and positive and negative predictive value (79% and 89% respectively) of the 1MSTST. The other 4 empirical studies included two predictive studies on patients with Covid-19, and two on HIV-positive patients with suspected pneumocystis pneumonia. We found no studies on the 40-step walk test (a less demanding test that is widely used in clinical practice to assess Covid-19 patients). Heterogeneity of study design precluded meta-analysis. DISCUSSION: Exertional desaturation tests have not yet been validated in patients with (or suspected of having) Covid-19. A stronger evidence base exists for the diagnostic accuracy of the 1MSTST in chronic long-term pulmonary disease; the relative intensity of this test may raise safety concerns in remote consultations or unstable patients. The less strenuous 40-step walk test should be urgently evaluated.","Kalin, Asli; Javid, Babak; Knight, Matthew; Inada-Kim, Matt; Greenhalgh, Trisha",Syst Rev,,478

379161,An Insight of the First Community Infected COVID-19 Patient in Beijing by Imported Case: Role of Deep Learning-Assisted CT Diagnosis,2021,"Medicine and public health have traditionally separated the prevention and treatment of communicable and noncommunicable diseases. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged this paradigm, particularly in the setting of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Overall, individuals with underlying CVD who acquire severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 experience up to a 10-fold higher case-fatality rate compared with the general population. Although the impact of the pandemic on cardiovascular health continues to evolve, few have defined this association from a frontline, public health perspective of populations disproportionately affected by CVD and COVID-19. Louisiana is ranked within the bottom 5 states for cardiovascular health, and it is home to several parishes that have experienced among the highest COVID-19 case-fatality rates nationally. Herein, we review CVD prevention and implications of COVID-19 in New Orleans, LA, a city holding a sobering yet resilient history with previous public health disasters. In particular, we discuss potential pandemic-driven changes in access to health care, preventive pharmacotherapy, and lifestyle behaviors, all of which may adversely affect CVD prevention and management, while amplifying racial disparities. Through this process, we highlight proposed recommendations for how CVD prevention efforts can be improved in the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises.","Razavi, Alexander C; Kelly, Tanika N; He, Jiang; Fernandez, Camilo; Whelton, Paul K; Krousel-Wood, Marie; Bazzano, Lydia A",J Am Heart Assoc,,478

METHODS: The superficial (SF) and deep macular VD of 50 patients with SARS CoV2 pneumonia who had positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and who recovered after receiving treatment and 55 healthy age- and gender-matched controls were compared using OCTA. Blood inflammation parameters were also recorded. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of age and gender (p = 0.147 and p = 0.504, respectively). Nor was there a difference with respect to smokers between the two groups (p = 0.231). In COVID-19 patients, the VDs in superior hemi quadrant, superior quadrant and inferior quadrant, were significantly lower (p = 0.033, p = 0.029 and p = 0.042, respectively) in superficial plexus. It was also significantly lower in parafovea, superior hemi and superior quadrants (p = 0.026, p < 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively) in deep plexus. In addition, white blood cell and neutrophil counts were significantly negatively correlated with the VD of the deep parafovea, deep superior quadrant and deep superior hemi quadrant (p < 0.05). There was no difference between the patient and control groups in both superficial and deep foveal avascular zone (FAZ) (p = 0.101 and p = 0.691 respectively). CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 disease, VD is low in some sectors in both SF and deep layers, but no change in FAZ.

We investigated the effects of an estimated 24 h urinary Na/K (e24hUNa/K) on a 6-year renal function decline among 927 urban Japanese community dwellers with no history of cardiovascular diseases and medication for hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. We partitioned the subjects into quartiles according to the e24hUNa/K. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD/EPI) formula and renal function decline was defined as an absolute value at or above the third quartile of the eGFR decline rate. A multivariable logistic regression model was used for estimation. Compared with the first quartile of the e24hUNa/K, multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for eGFR decline in the second, third, and fourth quartiles were 0.96 (95% confidence interval: 0.61-1.51), 1.06 (0.67-1.66), and 1.65 (1.06-2.57), respectively. These results were similar when the simple spot urine Na/K ratio was used in place of the e24hUNa/K. Apparently healthy urban residents with an almost within normal range mean baseline eGFR and high e24hUNa/K ratios had an increased risk for a future decline in renal function. Reducing the Na/K ratio may be important in the prevention of chronic kidney disease in its early stage.","Hattori, Hiroko; Hirata, Aya; Kubo, Sachimi; Nishida, Yoko; Nozawa, Miki; Kawamura, Kuniko; Hirata, Takumi; Kubota, Yoshimi; Sata, Mizuki; Kuwabara, Kazuyo; Higashiyama, Aya; Kadota, Aya; Sugiyama, Daisuke; Miyamatsu, Naomi; Miyamoto, Yoshihiro; Okamura, Tomonori",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,478

In this study, cellulose was used for co-HTC with swine manure to investigate the influence on the properties of the hydrochar. The yield of hydrochar obtained from co-HTC reduced gradually with the cellulose proportion increased, and the solid yield was lower than the theoretical value. This was because the cellulose-derived intermediates favored the stability of the fragments from hydrolysis of swine manure. The increased temperature resulted in the reduction of the hydrochar yield whereas the prolonged time enhanced the formation of solid product. The interaction of the co-HTC intermediates facilitated the formation of O-containing species, thus making the solid more oxygen- and hydrogen-rich with a higher volatility. In addition, the co-HTC affected the evolution of functionalities like -OH and CO during the thermal treatment of the hydrochar and altered its morphology by stuffing the pores from swine manure-derived solid with the microspheres from HTC of cellulose. The interaction of the varied intermediates also impacted the formation of amines, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, aromatics and the polymeric products in distinct ways.","Li, Qingyin; Lin, Haisheng; Zhang, Shu; Yuan, Xiangzhou; Gholizadeh, Mortaza; Wang, Yi; Xiang, Jun; Hu, Song; Hu, Xun",Sci Total Environ,,478

The ability of an organization to grow is heavily influenced by job satisfaction and employee motivation. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the factors affecting employee motivation and job satisfaction among medical and dental college faculty members in Pakistan, both in the private and public sector, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Medical and dental college faculty in Pakistan comprised the sample for this multi-centric cross-sectional study. A questionnaire, which was modified from an existing study, was distributed electronically. A student's independent t-test was applied to compare the mean scores of the responses from public and private sector employees. RESULTS: Of the 466 total respondents, 55 %were female and 45 %male. Public sector faculty reported receiving adequate resources and preferred online teaching. Both public and private sector faculty reported being satisfied with regular workshops and training. Private sector employees demonstrated more satisfaction with workplace safety measures. Public sector faculty highlighted the positive influence of job security and timely salary payments on productivity. CONCLUSION: Faculty members from both the public and private sector find working from home to be easier and better for handling one's workload. Public sector faculty noted job security, timely salary payments, and an individual's sense of achievement as sources of motivation. Private institutes are more lacking in ensuring their faculty feel content and satisfied. Measures should be undertaken to improve the level of motivation felt by faculty members, especially in the private sector.","Ali, Saqib; Alam, Beenish Fatima; Noreen, Sara; Anwar, Madiha; Qazi, Sabeen Hashmat; Hussain, Talib",Work,,478

Health care workers (HCWs) are at the forefront of any health care system and thus especially at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their potentially frequent and close contact with patients suffering from COVID-19. Serum samples from 198 HCWs with direct patient contact of a regional medical center and several outpatient facilities were collected during the early phase of the pandemic (April 2020) and tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Commercially available IgA- and IgG-specific ELISAs were used as screening technique, followed by an in-house neutralization assay for confirmation. Neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected in seven of 198 (3.5%) tested HCWs. There was no significant difference in seroprevalence between the regional medical center (3.4%) and the outpatient institution (5%). The overall seroprevalence of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in HCWs in both a large regional medical center and a small outpatient institution was low (3.5%) at the beginning of April 2020. The findings may indicate that the timely implemented preventive measures (strict hygiene protocols, personal protective equipment) were effective to protect from transmission of an airborne virus when only limited information on the pathogen was available.","Müller, Katharina; Girl, Philipp; Ruhnke, Michaela; Spranger, Mareike; Kaier, Klaus; von Buttlar, Heiner; Dobler, Gerhard; Borde, Johannes P",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,478

In efforts to respond to the growing volume of cases, hospitals have become a microcosm for US pandemic response. The COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted that hospital preparedness for biological events, such as a pandemic, are often inadequate and dependent on leadership investment in biopreparedness. This article discusses the proactive decision, before COVID-19, that a Phoenix-based hospital system made to invest in high-consequence disease (HCD) preparedness. Within these efforts, a gap analysis was performed, which led to creation of an HCD subcommittee and corresponding efforts to address vulnerabilities and opportunities for improvement. From establishing enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) and infectious disease training for frontline staff, to building an outbreak tracking mechanism for travel alerts within the electronic medical record, the HCD efforts of this hospital system created a stronger foundation to respond to biological events like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Popescu, Saskia; Leach, Rebecca; Robinson, Krystal",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,478

The present work addressed the question of how people dealt with stressors during a lockdown period and investigated the role of trait mindfulness and its subcomponents in coping and mental well-being. We recruited a sample of 93 participants to study coping reactions using a multi-wave study over a period of two-months with 13 measurement points. Multilevel analysis revealed that engagement-related coping such as problem-solving was positively related to well-being; the opposite was true for disengagement coping such as blaming. The mindfulness facet orientation towards experience (being open and accepting experiences without judgment) was negatively related to disengagement coping while the facet self-regulated attention (awareness of the present moment) was positively related to engagement coping. Self-regulated attention but not orientation towards experience was associated with savoring positive aspects of COVID-related changes over time. Engagement -related coping mediated the effects of trait mindfulness on well-being. The findings point to the differential effects of subcomponents of trait mindfulness in the context of coping and mental well-being.

Patients infected with 2019-nCoV are at risk for developing respiratory failure and requiring admission to critical care units. While providing optimal treatment for these patients, careful execution of infection control measures is necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission to other patients and to healthcare workers providing care. Although the exact mechanisms of transmission are currently unclear, human-to-human transmission can occur, and the risk of airborne spread during aerosol-generating medical procedures remains a concern in specific circumstances. This paper summarizes important considerations regarding patient screening, environmental controls, personal protective equipment, resuscitation measures (including intubation), and critical care unit operations planning as we prepare for the possibility of new imported cases or local outbreaks of 2019-nCoV. Although understanding of the 2019-nCoV virus is evolving, lessons learned from prior infectious disease challenges such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome will hopefully improve our state of readiness regardless of the number of cases we eventually manage in Canada.","Wax, Randy S; Christian, Michael D",Can J Anaesth,,478
386569,Understanding of COVID-19 based on current evidence,2020,"BACKGROUND: Host determinants of severe coronavirus disease 2019 include advanced age, comorbidities and male sex. Virologic factors may also be important in determining clinical outcome and transmission rates, but limited patient-level data is available. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study at seven public hospitals in Singapore. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and compared between individuals infected with different SARS-CoV-2 clades. Firth's logistic regression was used to examine the association between SARS-CoV-2 clade and development of hypoxia, and quasi-Poisson regression to compare transmission rates. Plasma samples were tested for immune mediator levels and the kinetics of viral replication in cell culture were compared. FINDINGS: 319 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection had clinical and virologic data available for analysis. 29 (9%) were infected with clade S, 90 (28%) with clade L/V, 96 (30%) with clade G (containing D614G variant), and 104 (33%) with other clades 'O' were assigned to lineage B.6. After adjusting for age and other covariates, infections with clade S (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0·030 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0·0002-0·29)) or clade O (B·6) (aOR 0·26 (95% CI 0·064-0·93)) were associated with lower odds of developing hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen compared with clade L/V. Patients infected with clade L/V had more pronounced systemic inflammation with higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. No significant difference in the severity of clade G infections was observed (aOR 0·95 (95% CI: 0·35-2·52). Though viral loads were significantly higher, there was no evidence of increased transmissibility of clade G, and replicative fitness in cell culture was similar for all clades. INTERPRETATION: Infection with clades L/V was associated with increased severity and more systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Infection with clade G was not associated with changes in severity, and despite higher viral loads there was no evidence of increased transmissibility.","Young, Barnaby E; Wei, Wycliffe E; Fong, Siew-Wai; Mak, Tze-Minn; Anderson, Danielle E; Chan, Yi-Hao; Pung, Rachael; Heng, Cheryl Sy; Ang, Li Wei; Zheng, Adrian Kang Eng; Lee, Bernett; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Pada, Surinder; Tambyah, Paul A; Parthasarathy, Purnima; Tan, Seow Yen; Sun, Louisa; Smith, Gavin Jd; Lin, Raymond Tzer Pin; Leo, Yee-Sin; Renia, Laurent; Wang, Lin-Fa; Ng, Lisa Fp; Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian; Lye, David Chien; Lee, Vernon J",EBioMedicine,,478

388757,Implementation of a Telemedicine Clinic in the Covid-19 Era,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically affected the economic and social activities, leading to large reductions in anthropogenic emissions on a global scale. Despite the reduction of primary emissions during the lockdown period, heavy haze pollution was observed unexpectedly in megacities in North and East China. In this study, we conducted online measurements of organic aerosol in a background site before and during the lockdown in Guanzhong basin, Northwest China. The oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) increased from 24% of total OA (3.2 ± 1.6 µg m-3) before lockdown to 54% of total OA (4.5 ± 1.3 µg m-3) during lockdown, likely due to substantial decrease of NOx emissions during lockdown which resulted in large increase of O3 and thus atmospheric oxidizing capacity. OOA showed higher mass concentrations and fractional contributions during lockdown than before lockdown, and increased with the increase of Ox in both periods. In comparison, aqueous secondary organic aerosol (aqSOA) showed high mass concentrations and fractional contributions in both polluted periods before and during lockdown with the increase of aerosol liquid water content (ALWC). The increase of aqSOA under high ALWC conditions is very likely the reason of pollution events during lockdown. Combined with trajectory analysis, the absence of Guanzhong cluster in polluted period during lockdown may play a key role in the OA variations between two polluted periods. In addition, when comparing the clusters from the same transmission directions between before lockdown and during lockdown, the OA fractions showed similar variations during lockdown in all clusters, suggesting the OA variations are widespread in northwest China.","Zhong, Haobin; Huang, Ru-Jin; Chang, Yunhua; Duan, Jing; Lin, Chunshui; Chen, Yang",Sci Total Environ,,478

391301,Lawsuits of Last Resort: Employees Fight for Safe Workplaces during COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs) are common during newborn resuscitation. Neonates with respiratory viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may pose a risk to healthcare workers. International guidelines differ on methods to minimize the risk due to limited data. OBJECTIVE: We examined the expiratory airflow dispersion during common neonatal resuscitation AGMPs using infant simulators. METHODS: Expiratory airflow dispersion in term and preterm manikins was simulated (n = 288) using fine particle smoke at tidal volumes of 5 ml/kg. Using ImageJ, we quantified dispersion during common airway procedures including endotracheal tube (ETT) and T-piece ventilation. RESULTS: Maximal expiratory dispersion distances for the unsupported airway and disconnected uncuffed ETT scenarios were 30.2 and 22.7 cm (term); 22.1 and 17.2 cm (preterm), respectively. Applying T-piece positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) via an ETT (ETTPEEP ) generated no expiratory dispersion but increased tube leak during term simulation, while ventilation breaths (ETTVENT ) caused significant expiratory dispersion and leak. There was no measurable dispersion during face mask ventilation. For term uncuffed ETT ventilation, the particle filter eliminated expiratory dispersion but increased leak. No expiratory dispersion and negligible leak were observed when combining a cuffed ETT and filter. Angulated T-pieces generated the greatest median dispersion distances of 35.8 cm (ETTPEEP ) and 23.3 cm (ETTVENT ). CONCLUSIONS: Airflow dispersion during neonatal AGMPs is greater than previously postulated and potentially could contaminate healthcare providers during resuscitation of infants infected with contagious viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. It is possible to mitigate this risk using particle filters and cuffed ETTs. Applicability in the clinical setting requires further evaluation.","Kwok, T039; Chang, ng; Swaby, Rabbi; Sharkey, Don",Pediatr. pulmonol,,478

Although most tumours initially respond to this therapy, some will be acquired resistant and progress to metastatic castration-resistant (mCRPC) disease which clinically tends to progress more rapidly than earlier disease manifestations. The underlying molecular biology of mCRPC is highly complex, and numerous mechanisms have been proposed that promote and retain androgen independence. In various clinical and preclinical data explored, the nature of intracellular signalling pathways mediating mitogenic acquired resistant effects of GPCRs in prostate cancer is poorly defined. G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) contributes to the modulation of basic cellular functions-such as cell proliferation, survival, or motility-and is involved in metabolic homeostasis, inflammation, or angiogenic processes. Moreover, altered GRK2 levels are starting to be reported in different tumoural contexts and shown to promote breast tumourigenesis or to trigger the tumoural angiogenic switch. Thus, we are exploring recent findings that present unexpected opportunities to interfere with major tumourigenic signals by manipulating GPCR-mediated pathways.","Tian, Jing-Yan; Chi, Chang-Liang; Bian, Ge; Guo, Feng-Jun; Wang, Xiao-Qing; Yu, Bing",Basic clin. pharmacol. toxicol,,478

The illness caused by SARS COV-2 is referred to as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is a highly contagious disease that has resulted in a global pandemic. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction, and death. The most common symptoms include fever, fatigue, dry cough, dyspnea, and diarrhea. Neurological manifestations have also been reported. However, the data on the association of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with COVID-19 are scarce. We report a rare case of a COVID-19-positive 36-year-old immunocompromised male who presented with clinical features of GBS. His clinical examination showed generalized weakness and hyporeflexia. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed albuminocytological dissociation. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered based on the high clinical suspicion of GBS. The patient's neurological condition worsened with progression to bulbar weakness and ultimately neuromuscular respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. His nerve conduction studies were consistent with demyelinating polyneuropathy. He received five plasma exchange treatments and was successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation. A brain and cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging was obtained to rule out other causes, which was normal. COVID-19 is believed to cause a dysregulated immune system, which likely plays an important role in the neuropathogenesis of GBS.","Rajdev, Kartikeya; Victor, Navin; Buckholtz, Elaine S; Hariharan, Praveen; Saeed, Muhammad Ahsan; Hershberger, Daniel M; Bista, Sabin",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,,478

Electrophysiological data has suggested MUs located superficially are larger than those located deeper within young muscle. However, the effects of ageing and exercise on MU heterogeneity across deep and superficial aspects of vastus lateralis (VL) remain unclear. Intramuscular electromyography was used to record individual MU potentials (MUPs) and near fibre MUPs (NFMs) from deep and superficial regions of the VL during 25% maximum voluntary contractions, in 83 males (15 young (Y), 17 young athletes (YA), 22 old (O) and 29 master athletes (MA)). MUP size and complexity were assessed using area and number of turns, respectively. Multilevel mixed effects linear regression models were performed to investigate the effects of depth in each group. MUP area was greater in deep compared with superficial MUs in Y (p<0.001) and O (p=0.012) but not in YA (p=0.071) or MA (p=0.653). MUP amplitude and NF MUP area were greater, and MUPs were more complex in deep MUPs from Y, YA and O (all p<0.05) but did not differ across depth in MA (all p>0.07). These data suggest MU characteristics differ according to depth within the VL which may be influenced by both ageing and exercise. A more homogenous distribution of MUP size and complexity across muscle depths in older athletes may be a result of a greater degree of age-related MU adaptations.","Jones, Eleanor J; Piasecki, Jessica; Ireland, Alex; Stashuk, Daniel W; Atherton, Philip J; Phillips, Bethan E; McPhee, Jamie S; Piasecki, Mathew",Geroscience,,478

In premenopausal women increased signalling of angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) via the Mas receptor has been linked to lower cardiovascular risk. Since stimulation of the Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis protects the endothelial barrier in acute lung injury (ALI), we hypothesised that increased Ang-(1-7)/Mas signalling may protect females over males in ALI/ARDS.Clinical data were collected from Charité inpatients. Sex differences in ALI were assessed in wild-type (WT) and Mas-deficient (Mas-/- ) mice. Endothelial permeability was assessed as weight change in isolated lungs and as trans-endothelial electrical resistance in vitroIn 734â090 Charité inpatients (2005-2016), ARDS had a higher incidence in men as compared to women. In murine ALI, male WT mice had more lung edema, protein leak, and histological evidence of injury than female WT mice. Lung weight change in response to platelet-activating factor (PAF) was more pronounced in male WT and female Mas-/- mice than female WT, whereas Mas receptor expression was higher in female WT lungs. Ovariectomy attenuated protection in female WT mice and reduced Mas receptor expression. In vitro, estrogen increased Mas receptor expression and attenuated endothelial leak in response to thrombin; this effect was alleviated by Mas receptor blockade.Improved lung endothelial barrier function protects female mice from ALI-induced lung edema. This effect is partially mediated via enhanced Ang-(1-7)/Mas signalling as a result of estrogen-dependent Mas expression.","Erfinanda, Lasti; Ravindran, Krishnan; Kohse, Franziska; Gallo, Kathleen; Preissner, Robert; Walther, Thomas; Kuebler, Wolfgang M",Eur. respir. j,,478

Their broad-spectrum antiviral activity, excellent safety profile, tolerability, low cost, and ready availability made them prime repurposing therapeutic candidates at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.Areas covered: Here, the authors discuss the history of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, the in vitro data which led to their widespread repurposing and adoption in COVID-19 and their complex pharmacokinetics. The evidence for the use of these drugs is assessed through in vivo animal experiments and the wealth of conflicting data and interpretations published during COVID-19, including the more informative results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The safety aspects of these drugs, in particular cardiotoxicity, are then reviewed.Expert opinion: The evidence from clinical trials in COVID-19 supports the well-established safety record of the 4-aminoquinolines at currently recommended dosage. In hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 RCTs show clearly that the 4-aminoquinolines are not beneficial. The only treatments with proven benefit at this stage of infection are immunomodulators (dexamethasone, IL-6 receptor antagonists).

This disease has become a reason for disturbance and concern. India, as a densely populated country, took initiative after the pandemic was declared. The objective of this study was to determine the mortality and recovery rates at 30 days from the first unlock phase after five phases of lockdown. The the number of infected people has continually increased, and currently, this pandemic continues to present challenges to public health. Subject and methods: Statistical analysis was used to calculate the mortality rate, ratio between active and death cases, active cases and recovered cases, recovered and death cases in India during the first 30 days of the unlock phase. Results: The relationship between the new cases, deaths and recovered cases, shows that the new and recovered cases increased progressively. From the scatter plot of daily deaths and new cases, the R2 value is 0.0047. That means the death ratio is low against the new cases. Also, if we look at another scatter plot, the ratio between new cases and recovery rate shows the R2 value is 0.8015. That means the recovery rate was very high during the study period in India. The R2 value of daily recovery and death is 0.0072. India faced a huge number of new coronavirus cases and increased death rate every day during the first unlock phase. Conclusion: There was not the same condition as in the preliminary stage. The affected graphs progressively increased, and the government is fighting to control this deadly infection. Central and state governments are working together to combat this pandemic.","Halder, Bijay; Bandyopadhyay, Jatisankar; Banik, Papiya",Z Gesundh Wiss,,478
398109,"[COVID-19, forstyrrelse af lungearkitektur]",2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus leading to serious respiratory disease and is spreading around the world at a raging speed. Recently there is emerging speculations that the central nervous system (CNS) may be involved during SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the respiratory failure. However, the existence of viral replication in CNS has not been confirmed due to the lack of evidence from autopsy specimens. Considering the tropism of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is prevailing in CNS, and the neuro-invasive property of human coronavirus was widely reported, there is a need to identified the possible complications during COVID-19 for CNS. In this review, we conduct a detailed summary for the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to infect central nervous system from latest biological fundamental of SARS-CoV-2 to the clinical experience of other human coronaviruses. To confirm the neuro-invasive property of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent influence on patients will require further exploration by both virologist and neurologist.","Huang, Jianhan; Zheng, Meijun; Tang, Xin; Chen, Yaxing; Tong, Aiping; Zhou, Liangxue",Front.

398219,Management of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy in persons with haemophilia,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) virus has caused a worldwide pandemic because of the viruss ability to transmit efficiently human-to-human. A key determinant of infection is the attachment of the viral spike protein to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Because of the presumed zoonotic origin of SC2, there is no practical way to assess every species susceptibility to SC2 by direct challenge studies. In an effort to have a better predictive model of animal host susceptibility to SC2, we expressed the ACE2 and/or transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) genes from humans and other animal species in the avian fibroblast cell line, DF1, that is not permissive to infection. We demonstrated that expression of both human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes is necessary to support SC2 infection and replication in DF1 and a non-permissive sub-lineage of MDCK cells. Titers of SC2 in these cell lines were comparable to those observed in control Vero cells. To further test the model, we developed seven additional transgenic cell lines expressing the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 derived from Felis (cat), Equus (horse), Sus (pig), Capra (goat), Mesocricetus (Golden hamster), Myotis lucifugus (Little Brown bat) and Hipposideros armiger (Great Roundleaf bat) in DF1 cells. Results demonstrate permissive replication of SC2 in cat, Golden hamster, and goat species, but not pig or horse, which correlated with the results of reported challenge studies. The development of this cell culture model allows for more efficient testing of the potential susceptibility of many different animal species for SC2 and emerging variant viruses. IMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 (SC2) is believed to have originated in animal species and jumped into humans where it has produced the greatest viral pandemic of our time. Identification of animal species susceptible to SC2 infection would provide information on potential zoonotic reservoirs, and transmission potential at the human-animal interface. Our work provides a model system to test the ability of the virus to replicate in an otherwise non-permissive cell line by transgenic insertion of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes from human and other animal species. The results from our in vitro model positively correlate with animal infection studies enhancing the predicative capability of the model. Importantly, we demonstrate that both proteins are required for successful virus replication. These findings establish a framework to test other animal species for susceptibility to infection that may be critical zoonotic reservoirs for transmission, as well as to test variant viruses that arise over time.","Kapczynski, Darrell R.; Sweeney, Ryan; Suarez, David L.; Spackman, Erica; Pantin-Jackwood, Mary",,,478

The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical features of face mask-related headache during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study carried out on healthcare workers at the Afyonkarahisar Health Sciences University. The number of workers at our university was established. Sample size was calculated using the G*Power program. A questionnaire consisting of questions relating to pre-existing headache, an aggravation in headache, and de-novo headache was filled out by 3 neurologists with all participants. Results: Data was collected from a total of 375 participants, after the exclusion of 5 individuals who refused to participate. Out of all participants, 26 (6.9%) used a filtering mask, 274 (73.1%) used a surgical mask, 75 (20.0%) participants used a combination of both masks. The number of participants with preexisting headache was 114 (30.4%) had pre-existing headache. Of those with pre-existing headache, 77 (67.5%) healthcare workers had reported an aggravation in their headache after mask use. De-novo headache was observed in 116 (30.9%) of participants. De-novo headache characteristics included throbbing in 17 (14.7%) participants and pressing in 99 (85.3%) participants. In addition, symptoms such as tachypnea, sleep disturbance, and fatigue were found to be significantly higher. Conclusions: This study indicates that healthcare workers develop headaches due to use of masks during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Köseoglu Toksoy, Cansu; Demirbas, Hayri; Bozkurt, Erhan; Acar, Hakan; Türk Börü, Ülkü",Korean J Pain,,478

We excluded patients being treated with other immunomodulant drugs, receiving low-dose corticosteroids and receiving corticosteroids 72 hours after admission. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality from hospital admission. The main exposure variable was corticosteroid therapy at a dose of &#8805;0.5 mg/kg of prednisone equivalents. It was introduced as binomial covariate in a logistic regression model for the primary endpoint and inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. RESULTS: Of 1717 patients with COVID-19 evaluated, 513 were included in the study, and of these, 170 (33%) were treated with corticosteroids.

We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and undergoing swab tests for SARS-CoV-2. Complete blood counts (CBCs) were analysed looking for predictors of test positivity. Eight significant predictors were identified and used to build a 'complete' CBC score with a discriminatory power for COVID-19 diagnosis of AUC 92% (p<0.0001). When looking at the weight of individual variables, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), age, platelets and eosinophils (MAPE: MCV &#8804;90 fL, 65 points; age &#8805;45 years, 100 points; platelets &#8804;180×103/µL, 73 points; eosinophils <0.01/µL, 94 points) gave the highest contribution and were used to build a 'simplified' MAPE score with a discriminatory power of AUC 88%. By setting the cut-off MAPE score at &#8805;173 points, sensitivity and specificity for COVID-19 diagnosis were 83% and 82%, respectively, and the actual test positivity rate was 60% as compared to 6% of patients with MAPE score <173 points (odds ratio 23.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.1-58.3, p-value <0.0001). In conclusion, CBC-based scores have potential for optimising the SARS-CoV-2 testing process: if these findings are confirmed in the future, swab tests may be waived for subjects with low score and uncertain symptoms, while they may be considered for asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic patients with high scores.","Formica, Vincenzo; Minieri, Marilena; Bernardini, Sergio; Ciotti, Marco; D039,; Agostini, Cartesio; Roselli, Mario; Andreoni, Massimo; Morelli, Cristina; Parisi, Giusy; Federici, Massimo; Paganelli, Carla; Legramante, Jacopo M",Clin Med (Lond),,478
402631,Emergency endoscopic variceal band ligation in a COVID-19 patient presented with hematemesis while on mechanical ventilation,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a worldwide epidemic of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Antibody drugs present an effective weapon for tens of millions of COVID-19 patients. Antibodies disrupting the interactions between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) effectively block SARS-CoV-2 cell entry into host cells. In order to rapidly develop more potent neutralizing antibodies, we utilized virtual scanning mutageneses and molecular dynamics simulations to optimize the antibody of P2B-2F6 isolated from single B cells of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Two potent P2B-2F6 mutants, namely H:V106R and H:V106R/H:P107Y, were found to possess higher binding affinities with the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 than others. Polar interactions are preferred near 106 and 107 paratope residues of the heavy chain. The mutations also increase the hydrogen-bonding network formed between the antibody and the RBD. Notably, the optimized antibodies possess potential neutralizing activity against the alarming SARS-CoV-2 variant of N501Y. This study provides insights into structure-based optimization of antibodies with higher affinity to the antigen. We hope that our proposed antibody mutants could contribute to the development of improved therapies against COVID-19.","Chen, Jiao; Wu, Fei; Lin, Dan; Kong, Weikang; Cai, Xueting; Yang, Jie; Sun, Xiaoyan; Cao, Peng",Comput Biol Med,,478

403113,Metabolic syndrome and COVID-19,2020,"There are currently no proven or approved treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Early anecdotal reports and limited in vitro data led to the significant uptake of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and to lesser extent chloroquine (CQ), for many patients with this disease. As an increasing number of patients with COVID-19 are treated with these agents and more evidence accumulates, there continues to be no high-quality clinical data showing a clear benefit of these agents for this disease. Moreover, these agents have the potential to cause harm, including a broad range of adverse events including serious cardiac side effects when combined with other agents. In addition, the known and potent immunomodulatory effects of these agents which support their use in the treatment of auto-immune conditions, and provided a component in the original rationale for their use in patients with COVID-19, may, in fact, undermine their utility in the context of the treatment of this respiratory viral infection. Specifically, the impact of HCQ on cytokine production and suppression of antigen presentation may have immunologic consequences that hamper innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses for patients with COVID-19. Similarly, the reported in vitro inhibition of viral proliferation is largely derived from the blockade of viral fusion that initiates infection rather than the direct inhibition of viral replication as seen with nucleoside/tide analogs in other viral infections. Given these facts and the growing uncertainty about these agents for the treatment of COVID-19, it is clear that at the very least thoughtful planning and data collection from randomized clinical trials are needed to understand what if any role these agents may have in this disease. In this article, we review the datasets that support or detract from the use of these agents for the treatment of COVID-19 and render a data informed opinion that they should only be used with caution and in the context of carefully thought out clinical trials, or on a case-by-case basis after rigorous consideration of the risks and benefits of this therapeutic approach.","Meyerowitz, Eric A; Vannier, Augustin G L; Friesen, Morgan G N; Schoenfeld, Sara; Gelfand, Jeffrey A; Callahan, Michael V; Kim, Arthur Y; Reeves, Patrick M; Poznansky, Mark C",FASEB J,,478

404282,Cardiac Surgery Model During COVID-19 Pandemic: Now It's Time to Ramp Up,2021,"The recent observation of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) without notable magnetization in antiferromagnets has suggested that ferromagnetic ordering is not a necessary condition. Thus, recent theoretical studies have proposed that higher-rank magnetic multipoles formed by clusters of spins (cluster multipoles) can generate the AHE without magnetization. Despite such an intriguing proposal, controlling the unconventional AHE by inducing these cluster multipoles has not been investigated. Here, we demonstrate that strain can manipulate the hidden Berry curvature effect by inducing the higher-rank cluster multipoles in spin-orbit-coupled antiferromagnets. Observing the large AHE on fully strained antiferromagnetic Nd2Ir2O7 thin films, we prove that strain-induced cluster T 1-octupoles are the only source of observed AHE. Our results provide a previously unidentified pathway for generating the unconventional AHE via strain-induced magnetic structures and establish a platform for exploring undiscovered topological phenomena via strain in correlated materials.","Kim, Woo Jin; Oh, Taekoo; Song, Jeongkeun; Ko, Eun Kyo; Li, Yangyang; Mun, Junsik; Kim, Bongju; Son, Jaeseok; Yang, Zhuo; Kohama, Yoshimitsu; Kim, Miyoung; Yang, Bohm-Jung; Noh, Tae Won",Sci Adv,,478

Drastic measures to combat COVID-19 are warranted due to its contagiousness and higher mortality rates, specifically in the aged patient population. At the current stage, due to the lack of effective treatment strategies for COVID-19 innovative approaches need to be considered. It is well known that host cellular miRNAs can directly target both viral 3'UTR a nd coding region of the viral genome to induce the antiviral effect. In this study, we did in silico analysis of human miRNAs targeting SARS (4 isolates) and COVID-19 (29 recent isolates from different regions) genome and correlated our findings with aging and underlying conditions. We found 848 common miRNAs targeting the SARS genome and 873 common micr oRNAs targeting the COVID-19 genome. Out of a total of 848 miRNAs from SARS, only 558 commonly present in all COVID-19 isolates. Interestingly, 315 miRNAs are unique for COVID-19 isolates and 290 miRNAs unique to SARS. We also noted that out of 29 COVID-19 isolates, 19 isolates have identical miRNA targets. The COVID - 19 isolates, Netherland (EPI_ISL_422601), Australia (EPI_ISL_413214), and Wuhan (EPI_ISL_403931) showed six, four, and four unique miRNAs targets, respectively. Furthermore, GO, and KEGG pathwa y analysis showed that COVID-19 targeting human miRNAs involved in various age-related signaling and diseases. Recent studies also suggested that some of the human miRNAs targeting COVID-19 decreased with aging and underlying conditions. GO and KEGG identified impaired signaling pathway may be due to low abundance miRNA which might be one of the contributing factors for the increasing severity and mortality in aged individuals and with other underlying conditions. Further, in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to validate some of these targets and identify potential therapeutic targets.","Fulzele, Sadanand; Sahay, Bikash; Yusufu, Ibrahim; Lee, Tae Jin; Sharma, Ashok; Kolhe, Ravindra; Isales, Carlos M.",Aging Dis.,,478

405922,Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 After Gynecologic Oncology Surgery in Three Women: A Retrospective Review of Medical Records,2020,"BACKGROUND: Spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy forced health facilities to drastically change their organization to face the overwhelming number of infected patients needing hospitalization. The aim of this paper is to share with all the vascular community the protocol developed by the USL (Unità Sanitaria Locale) Toscana Centro for the reorganization of the Vascular Surgery Unit during the COVID-19 emergency, hoping to help other institutions to face the emergency during the hard weeks coming. METHODS: The USL Toscana Centro is a public Italian health care institution including four districts (Empoli, Florence, Pistoia, Prato) with 13 different hospitals, serving more than 1,500,000 people in a 5000 km2 area. The USL adopted a protocol of reorganization of the Vascular Surgery Unit during the first difficult weeks of the epidemic, consisting in the creation of a Vascular Hub for urgent cases, with a profound reorganization of activities, wards, surgical operators, operating blocks, and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. RESULTS: All 13 hospitals are now COVID-19 as the first days of April passed. The San Giovanni di Dio Hospital (Florence) has more than 80 COVID-19 patients in different settings (ICU, medical and surgical ward), which at the time of writing is almost one-third of the total hospital capacity (80/260 beds). It has been identified as the Surgical Hub for urgent vascular COVID-19 cases. Therefore, the elective surgical and office activities were reduced by 30% and 80%, respectively, and reserved to priority cases. A corner of the whole operating block, well separate from the remaining operating rooms, was rapidly converted into one operating room and six ICU beds dedicated to COVID patients. The COVID-19 surgical path now includes an emergency room for suspected COVID-19 patients directly connected to an elevator for the transfer of COVID patients in the COVID operating block and dedicated COVID-19 ward and ICU beds. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid modification of hospital settings, a certain ""flexibility"" of the medical personnel, a stepwise shutdown of vascular surgical and office activity, and the necessity of a strong leadership are mandatory to cope with the tsunami of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Chisci, Emiliano; Masciello, Fabrizio; Michelagnoli, Stefano",J Vasc Surg,,478

With the differences in health care systems and lockdown policies in various regions, the pandemic's effect on organ donation and transplant service may vary. Most of the deceased donor organ referrals in our hospital came from non-intensive care units (ICUs). The objective of this study is to report our experience and quantify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on deceased donor organ donation in our center. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study comparing the deceased donor organ donation activity during the period January 23 to November 30, 2020 with the same period in 2018 in Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong. RESULTS: There was a 26.9% reduction in deceased donor organ donor referral in 2020 compared with 2018. No significant difference in the proportion of referrals from ICU or non-ICU areas between the 2 time periods was observed. The brain death confirmation rate was significantly higher in 2020 (40.8% vs 20.2%, P = .003). Nine patients had family consent for organ donation in 2020 (vs 7 patients in the same period in 2018). There were no significant differences in consent rate and number of recovered organs between the 2 periods. CONCLUSIONS: With effective measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 in a community, it is possible to support the needs of both patients with COVID-19 and deceased donor organ donation services.","Cheung, Chi Yuen; Pong, Mei Lan; Au Yeung, Suk Fun; Chak, Wai Leung",Transplant Proc,,478

Unlike the standard SIR model, SIR-NC does not assume population conservation. Although similar in form to the standard SIR, SIR-NC admits a closed form solution while allowing us to model mortality, and also provides different, and arguably a more realistic, interpretation of the model parameters. Numerical comparisons of this SIR-NC model with the standard, population conserving, SIR model are provided. Extensions to include imported infections, interacting communities, and models that include births and deaths are presented and analyzed. Several numerical examples are also presented to illustrate these models. Two control problems for the SIR-NC epidemic model are presented. First we consider the continuous time model predictive control in which the cost function variables correspond to the levels of lockdown, the level of testing and quarantine, and the number of infections. We also include a switching cost for moving between lockdown levels. A discrete time version that is more amenable to computation is then presented along with numerical illustrations. We then consider a multi-objective and multi-community control where we can define multiple cost functions on the different communities and obtain the minimum cost control to keep the value function corresponding to these control objectives below a prescribed threshold.","Borkar, Vivek S.; Manjunath, D.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.06445v2.pdf,478

METHODS: Symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were tested throughout a large psychiatric hospital to determine penetrance. The hospital followed initial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent (N=51 of 65) of tested patients in the building where the first positive patient was housed (building zero) tested positive for COVID-19. Eighty-eight percent (N=14 of 16) of tested asymptomatic patients in building zero were positive, compared with 12% (N=6 of 51) of randomly selected asymptomatic patients in a sample from the rest of the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of patients can become positive for COVID-19 despite following initial CDC guidelines. As such, use of masks by all patients in close-quarter settings prior to the first positive case appears warranted.

406911,Management of ovarian cancer patients in affected areas during COVID-19 pandemic: Japan and Korea,2020,"The deepening integration of telecommunication technology into other industries has giving birth to a variety of new applications, such as self-driving, telemedicine, and intelligent manufacturing. Whether the telecom service is traditional or new, users put forward personalized and multidimensional requirements for performance, which results in a conflict between their requirements for customized service and the failure of telecom enterprises to meet every requirement. This contradiction directly influences the sustainability and stable development of the telecom industry. To address this problem, this paper carried out systematic research into collaboration and adaptation between business-model and technological innovation. From the view of business-model innovation, this paper proposes a novel service provision mode named Multidimensional Customization of Telecom Services for Each User to analyze the value of the business model and the factors that influence it. From the view of technological innovation, it will design an implementation scheme corresponding to the business model, and verify its advantages in network-carrying capacity and significance to enterprises’ business value through a simulation experiment. The research shows that the novel mode is beneficial both to telecom users and telecom enterprises. In addition, it addresses this novel mode’s impact on environmental sustainability and the regulation of the telecom industry, as well as the limitations of this research and future research directions.","Wang, Xueyan Wu Hong Lu Lu",Sustainability,,478

408384,Cancer population may be paradoxically protected from severe manifestations of COVID-19,2020,"Many coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients demonstrate lethal respiratory complications caused by cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Multiple cytokines have been implicated in CRS, but levels of tumor necrosis factor superfamily 14 (TNFSF14) (LIGHT) have not been previously measured in this setting. In this study, we observed significantly elevated serum LIGHT levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to healthy age- and gender-matched control patients. The assay detected bioavailable LIGHT unbound to the inhibitor Decoy receptor-3 (DcR3). Bioavailable LIGHT levels were elevated in patients both on and off ventilatory support, with a trend toward higher levels in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In hospitalized patients over the age of 60, who exhibited a mortality rate of 82%, LIGHT levels were significantly higher (P = 0.0209) in those who died than in survivors. As previously reported, interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were also elevated in these patients, with significantly (P = 0.0076) higher levels observed in patients who died than in survivors, paralleling the LIGHT levels. Although attempts to block IL-6 binding to its receptor have shown limited success in COVID-19 CRS, neutralization of LIGHT may prove to be more effective owing to its more central role in regulating antiviral immune responses. The findings presented here demonstrate that LIGHT is a cytokine which may play an important role in COVID-19 patients presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and CRS and suggest that LIGHT neutralization may be beneficial to COVID-19 patients.","Perlin, David S; Zafir-Lavie, Inbal; Roadcap, Lori; Raines, Shane; Ware, Carl F; Neil, Garry A",MSphere,,478

The number of studies examining the symptoms of the otolaryngology system and organs in COVID-19 patients is limited. The purpose of this study is to show whether COVID-19 infections cause any changes in nasal physiology in adult patients by measuring the mucociliary clearance (MCC) time with the saccharin test. METHODS: One hundred one patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection (group 1, nâ=â42 smokers and group 2, nâ=â59 nonsmokers) and 87 individuals without COVID-19 infection as the control group (group 3, nâ=â33 smokers and group 4, nâ=â54 nonsmokers) were included in the study. A saccharin test was used to evaluate the nasal MCC time. RESULTS: Mucociliary clearance test averages of the groups were determined as 473.571â±â263.684, 442.966â±â228.463, 468.333â±â267.367, 412.629â±â192.179 seconds, respectively.

The second group, with the most prolonged MCC duration, was determined as the smoking control group (468.333â±â267.367âseconds). No statistically significant difference was found in intergroup mucociliary clearance time (Pâ=â0.760).

410249,COVID-19 and Cushing Disease: A Protective or a Deadly Combination?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses have caused outbreaks of respiratory disease since the beginning of the 21st century, representing a significant threat to public health. Together, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and, more recently, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world. Thus, investments in research and the development of strategies aimed at diagnosing, treating, and preventing these infections are urgently needed. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the patents that address pathogenic coronaviruses in Google Patents databases in the last year (2019-2020). METHOD: The search strategy was carried out in April 2020, based on the keywords ""SARS"", ""SARS-CoV"", ""MERS"", ""MERS-CoV"", ""SARS-CoV-2"" and ""COVID-19. Out of the patents examined, 25 were selected for a short description in this study. RESULTS: A total of 191 patents were analyzed, 149 of which were related to SARS-CoV, and 29 and 12 were related to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, respectively. The patents addressed the issues of diagnosis, therapeutic agents, prevention and control, along with other applications. CONCLUSION: Several promising strategies have been documented in intellectual property databases favoring the need for further studies on the pathogenesis and optimization of the diagnosis and therapeutic treatment for these emerging infections.","Dos Santos, Michelli; Ferreira, André Vinícius Fernandes; da Silva, Jonatas Oliveira; Nogueira, Laís Moreira; Machado, Juliana Martins; Francisco, Mariana Ferraz Chaves; Campos-da-Paz, Mariana; Giunchetti, Rodolfo Cordeiro; Galdino, Alexsandro Sobreira",Recent patents on biotechnology (Online),,478

We aimed to evaluate the provision of obstetrics and gynaecology services in the UK during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Interview-based national survey. SETTING: Women's healthcare units in the National Health Service. POPULATION: Junior doctors in obstetrics and gynaecology. METHODS: Participants were interviewed by members of the UK Audit and Research in Obstetrics and Gynaecology trainees' collaborative between 28 March and 7 April 2020. We used a quantitative analysis for closed-ended questions and a thematic framework analysis for open comments. RESULTS: We received responses from 148/155 units (95%), most of the participants were in years 3-7 of training (121/148, 82%). Most completed specific training drills for managing obstetric and gynaecological emergencies in women with COVID-19 (89/148, 60.1%) and two-person donning and doffing of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (96/148, 64.9%). The majority of surveyed units implemented COVID-19-specific protocols (130/148, 87.8%), offered adequate PPE (135/148, 91.2%) and operated dedicated COVID-19 emergency theatres (105/148, 70.8%). Most units reduced face-to-face antenatal clinics (117/148, 79.1%) and suspended elective gynaecology services (131/148, 88.5%). The 2-week referral pathway for oncological gynaecology was not affected in half of the units (76/148, 51.4%), but half reported a planned reduction in oncology surgery (82/148, 55.4%). CONCLUSION: The provision of obstetrics and gynaecology services in the UK during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be in line with current guidelines, but strategic planning is needed to restore routine gynaecology services and ensure safe access to maternity care in the long term.

413154,Clinical characteristics of 19 neonates born to mothers with COVID-19,2020,"In late 2018 and early 2019, the city of Belgrade was host to as many as four different exhibitions with the topic of human-animal relations. The fact that these exhibitions were held in such a short time in a city the size of Belgrade is in itself interesting, seeing as the topic of human-animal relations is still not part of the academic and artistic mainstream globally, let alone in Serbia. The themes and messages of these exhibitions seem even more relevant with regard to the current global situation. Thus, the two main goals of this paper are: 1. to point out the importance studying human-animal relations in the social sciences and the humanities can have for the understanding of different economic, political and ideological assemblages of the anthropocene that make human civilization, seemingly apart from nature, susceptible to catastrophes such as the current COVID-19 global pandemic - through the analysis of the contents of the exhibitions and the panel discussions that accompanied them;2. to indicate the welcome rise in interest in issues of human-animal relations evident in both the general public and academic and artistic contexts in Serbia. The paper offers an analytical overview of the contents of the Of Animals and Humans, Covoyagers, Instinct and Terrain and Emil/Specimen B5044 exhibitions, the ensuing discussions with the public and some of the main issues raised within these discussions such as the issue of responsibility humans have toward other species we share the planet with, as well as the issue of the accountability of big polluters, which is often swept under the rug through the utilization of discourse on the impact of Man - with a capital m - on the environment. The paper also emphasizes the importance of these topics for life in the anthropocene, and calls attention to the emergent interest in human-animal relations and innovative theoretical approaches to them in Serbian academia, especially in ethnology and anthropology and archaeology.","Zakula, S.",Etnoantropoloski Problemi-Issues in Ethnology and Anthropology,,478

414017,CLINICAL ORAL ABSTRACTS: Safety and efficacy of no-test medication abortion: A retrospective multi-site study,2021,"Bacterial genomes have been shown to be partitioned into several kilobases long chromosomal domains that are topologically independent from each other, meaning that change of DNA superhelicity in one domain does not propagate to neighbors. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have been performed to question the nature of the topological barriers at play, leading to several predictions on possible molecular actors. Here, we address the question of topological barriers using polymer models of supercoiled DNA chains. More specifically, we determine under which conditions DNA-bridging proteins may act as topological barriers. To this end, we developed a coarse-grained bead-and-spring model and investigated its properties through Brownian dynamics simulations. As a result, we find that DNA-bridging proteins must exert rather strong constraints on their binding sites: they must block the diffusion of the excess of twist through the two binding sites on the DNA molecule and, simultaneously, prevent the rotation of one DNA segment relative to the other one. Importantly, not all DNA-bridging proteins satisfy this second condition. For example, single bridges formed by proteins that bind DNA non-specifically, like H-NS dimers, are expected to fail with this respect. Our findings might also explain, in the case of specific DNA-bridging proteins like LacI, why multiple bridges are required to create stable independent topological domains. Strikingly, when the relative rotation of the DNA segments is not prevented, relaxation results in complex intrication of the two domains. Moreover, while the value of the torsional stress in each domain may vary, their differential is preserved. Our work also predicts that nucleoid associated proteins known to wrap DNA must form higher protein-DNA complexes to efficiently work as topological barriers.","Joyeux, Marc; Junier, Ivan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05973v1.pdf,478

However, the definition of well-being and the evidence base behind such guidelines remain unclear. AIMS: The aims of the study are to assess the applicability of well-being guidelines in practice, identify unaddressed healthcare workers' needs and provide recommendations for supporting front-line staff during the current and future pandemics. METHOD: This paper discusses the findings of a qualitative study based on interviews with front-line healthcare workers in the UK (n = 33), and examines them in relation to a rapid review of well-being guidelines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 14). RESULTS: The guidelines placed greater emphasis on individual mental health and psychological support, whereas healthcare workers placed greater emphasis on structural conditions at work, responsibilities outside the hospital and the invaluable support of the community. The well-being support interventions proposed in the guidelines did not always respond to the lived experiences of staff, as some reported not being able to participate in these interventions because of understaffing, exhaustion or clashing schedules. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers expressed well-being needs that aligned with socio-ecological conceptualisations of well-being related to quality of life. This approach to well-being has been highlighted in literature on support of healthcare workers in previous health emergencies, but it has not been monitored during this pandemic. Well-being guidelines should explore the needs of healthcare workers, and contextual characteristics affecting the implementation of recommendations.","Vera San Juan, Norha; Aceituno, David; Djellouli, Nehla; Sumray, Kirsi; Regenold, Nina; Syversen, Aron; Mulcahy Symmons, Sophie; Dowrick, Anna; Mitchinson, Lucy; Singleton, Georgina; Vindrola-Padros, Cecilia",BJPsych Open,,478

415660,Cardiac Involvement After Recovering From COVID-19-Reply,2020,"BACKGROUND: Missed appointments can have an adverse impact on health outcomes by delaying appropriate imaging, which can be critical in influencing treatment decisions. OBJECTIVE: To assess for socioeconomic and imaging exam factors associated with missed appointments among children scheduled for diagnostic imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed children (<18 years) scheduled for outpatient diagnostic imaging during a 12-month period. In doing so, we obtained socioeconomic and radiology exam characteristics (modality, intravenous contrast administration, radiation and use of sedation) data from the electronic medical record. We employed multivariate logistic regression to assess the association of socioeconomic, demographic and imaging exam characteristics with imaging missed appointments. RESULTS: In total, 7,275 children met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 8.8 years (standard deviation [SD] = 6.2 years) and the study population consisted of 52% female gender, 69% White race, 38% adolescent age group and 32% with a median household income by ZIP-code category of <$50,000. Logistic regression showed increased likelihood of missed appointments among children of Black/African-American race (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-2.5); with insurance categories including Medicaid (OR=2.0; 95% CI=1.6-2.4), self-pay (OR=2.1; 95% CI=1.3-3.6) and other (OR=2.7; 95% CI=1.3-5.4); with <$50,000 median household income by ZIP-code category (OR=1.7; 95% CI=1.4-2.0); and with examination wait time of 7-21 days (OR=2.7; 95% CI=2.1-3.5) and >21 days (OR=3.7; 95% CI=2.9-4.8). The use of radiation, intravenous contrast agent or sedation was not associated with increased likelihood of missed appointments. CONCLUSION: Expanding our knowledge of how different socioeconomic and imaging-related factors influence missed appointments among children can serve as a foundational step to better understand existing and emerging disparities and inform strategies to advance health equity efforts in radiology.","Flores, Efrén J; Daye, Dania; Peña, Miguel A; Lopez, Diego B; Jaimes, Camilo; Glover, McKinley",Pediatr. radiol,,478
415904,The Epidemiology of COVID-19 and MS-Related Characteristics in a National Sample of People With MS in China,2021,"Healthcare workers are at an increased risk of infection, harm and death from COVID-19. Close and prolonged exposure to individuals infectious with SARS-CoV-2 leads to infection. A person's individual characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity and comorbidities) then influence the subsequent risk of COVID-19 leading to hospitalisation, critical care admission or death. While relative risk is often reported as a measure of individual danger, absolute risk is more important and dynamic, particularly in the healthcare setting. Individual risk interacts with exposure and environmental risk-factors, and the extent of mitigation to determine overall risk. Hospitals are a unique environment in which there is a significantly increased risk of infection for all healthcare workers. Anaesthetists and intensivists particularly are at high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infected patients due to their working environments and exposure to certain patient groups. However, the available evidence suggests that the risk for this group of individuals is not currently increased. This review examines factors associated with increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, increasing severity of COVID-19 and death. A risk tool is proposed that includes personal, environmental and mitigating factors, and enables an individualised dynamic 'point-of-time' risk assessment.","Cook, T M",Anaesthesia,,478

One of the most important known complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the occurrence of venous thromboembolic events, especially in critically ill patients who are hospitalized in the intensive care unit. The pathology of this event is complex and multifactorial, but the main problem now is the timely diagnosis of these phenomena, which can reduce the mortality and morbidity of patients. Deterioration of clinical condition in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection along with increased coagulation markers can increase clinical suspicion of venous thromboembolic events.

418172,Rising Concern on Damaged Testis of COVID-19 Patients,2020,"Introduction: Humanity is facing a global pandemic at the start of 2020. The health systems of each country are reorganizing to cope with an influx of patients. This crisis reorganization is the source of psychological tension that can lead to symptomatic manifestations in many caregivers. This situation is similar in many points to that encountered by soldiers on external operations (loss of usual bearings, feeling of threat, focusing of attention on the crisis, deterioration of living conditions with limitation of the possibility of taking breaks). The aim of this work is to describe at the hospital level the changes in the professional and personal environment linked to the crisis likely to cause stress and then to describe the clinical manifestations observed both on an individual and collective level. Analysis of the situation: In this chapter, after having described the reorganization of the hospital in which we operate, we try to identify various factors likely to have psychological repercussions such as: the perceived urgency of the situation, the achievement of privacy, the reorganization of the work tool and the exercise of unusual tasks in newly formed teams, but also the fear of lack, the anxiety linked to contamination, the uncertainties linked to the threat. Clinical description: In this chapter, we describe the clinical manifestations observed in the caregivers of the hospital in reaction to the crisis. Rather than decompensations, they are mainly anxious manifestations characterized by an increase in somatic concerns, an accentuation of verification rituals, an increase in snacking and the consumption of certain psychoactive substances (coffee, tobacco) and for certain people a character stiffening. On a collective level, it was mainly the misuse of social networks reflecting the group's anxieties (search for meaning and responsibility, need for certainty) that was observed. Conclusion: We then conclude with a description of the approach that led to the establishment of a support system by offering a graduated response, re-assessable over time, compatible with the maintenance of usual activity while maintaining a therapeutic distance.","Gilles, Thomas",Ann. med.-psychol,,478

We assessed the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers, persistent congestion and CKD and their prognostic implications in patients with acute heart failure. METHODS: We enrolled 97 hospitalised patients (mean age: 66â±â12 years, ejection fraction: 30â±â8%) with acute heart failure. Before discharge, congestion was assessed using a heart failure scoring system on the basis of Framingham criteria. Circulating levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, TGF-ß-1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-&#945;, soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor type 1 and 2 were measured. Patients were divided into four groups according to the presence of CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60âml/min/1.73âm) and congestion (Framingham heart failure score &#8805;2). The primary end point was the combination of death and rehospitalisation for acute heart failure. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 32 months, 37 patients died and 14 were rehospitalised for acute heart failure. Patients with CKD and congestion had significantly higher TNF-&#945; (Pâ=â0.037), soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor type 1 (Pâ=â0.0042) and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor type 2 (Pâ=â0.001), lower TGF-ß-1 (Pâ=â0.02) levels, and the worst outcome (Pâ<â0.0001). Congestion (Pâ=â0.01) and CKD (Pâ=â0.02) were independent predictors of the end-point together with N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (Pâ=â0.002) and TNF-&#945; (Pâ=â0.004). TNF-&#945; attenuated the direct relation between CKD, congestion and outcome, explaining 40% of the difference in the outcome. CONCLUSION: In patients hospitalised with acute heart failure, the prognostic impact of persistent congestion and CKD is associated with increased cytokine levels, which may also interfere with the outcome.","Pugliese, Nicola R; Fabiani, Iacopo; Conte, Lorenzo; Nesti, Lorenzo; Masi, Stefano; Natali, Andrea; Colombo, Paolo C; Pedrinelli, Roberto; Dini, Frank L",J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),,478

The health situation is understood as a set of selected factors influencing inhabitants' health and the healthcare system in their area of residence. So far, studies concerning the health situation of selected territorial units have been based on data relating to a specific year rather than longer periods. The task of assessing province homogeneity was carried out in two stages. In stage one, the original spatio-temporal data space (space of multivariate time series) was transformed into a functional discriminant coordinates space. The resulting functional discriminant coordinates are synthetic measures of the health situation of inhabitants of particular provinces. These measures contain complete information regarding 8 diagnostic variables examined over a period of 6 years. In the second stage, the Ward method, commonly used in cluster analysis, was applied in order to identify groups of homogeneous provinces in the space of functional discriminant coordinates. Sixteen provinces were divided into four clusters. The homogeneity of the clusters was confirmed by the multivariate functional coefficient of variation.","Krzysko, Miroslaw; Wolynki, Waldemar; Szymkowiak, Marcin; Wojtyla, Andrzej",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,478

OXA-48-like enzymes and their variants are unique carbapenemases with low or null hydrolytic activity toward carbapenems but no intrinsic activity against expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. CPEs have been classified by the WHO as high-priority pathogens given their association with morbidity and mortality and the scarce number of effective antibiotic treatments. In Spain, the frequency of OXA-48 CPE outbreaks is higher than in other European countries, representing the major resistance mechanism of CPEs. Horizontal transfer of plasmids and poor effective antibiotic treatment are additional threats to the correct prevention and control of these hospital outbreaks. One of the most important risk factors is antibiotic pressure, specifically carbapenem overuse. We explored the use of these antibiotics in Spain and analyzed the frequency, characteristics and prevention of CPE outbreaks. Future antibiotic stewardship programs along with specific preventive measures in hospitalized patients must be reinforced and updated in Spain.","Rivera-Izquierdo, Mario Antonio Jesús Láinez-Ramos-Bossini Rivera-Izquierdo Carlos López-Gómez Jairo Fernández-Martínez Nicolás Francisco Redruello-Guerrero Pablo Luis Miguel Martín-delosReyes Martínez-Ruiz Virginia Moreno-Roldán Elena Jiménez-Mejías Eladio",Antibiotics,,478

Using access data from a free Android app with curated regional anesthesia learning modules, we aimed to estimate global interest in regional anesthesia and potential applications to clinical practice stratified by World Bank income level. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data collected from the free Android app ""Anesthesiologist"" from December 2015 to April 2020. The app performs basic anesthetic calculations and provides links to videos on performing 12 different nerve blocks. Users of the app were classified on the basis of whether or not they had accessed the links. Nerve blocks were also classified according to major use (surgical block, postoperative pain adjunct, rescue block). RESULTS: Practitioners in low- and middle-income countries accessed the app more frequently than in high-income countries as measured by clicks. Users from low- and middle-income countries focused mainly on surgical blocks: ankle, axillary, infraclavicular, interscalene, and supraclavicular blocks. In high-income countries, more users viewed postoperative pain blocks: adductor canal, popliteal, femoral, and transverse abdominis plane blocks. Utilization of the app was constant over time with a general decline with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The use of an in app survey and analytics can help identify gaps and opportunities for regional anesthesia techniques and practices. This is especially impactful in limited-resource areas, such as lower-income environments and can lead to targeted educational initiatives.","Moll, Vanessa; Mariano, Edward R; Kitzman, Jamie M; O039,; Reilly-Shah, Vikas N; Jabaley, Craig S",PLoS One,,478
420962,"Management of acute stroke and urgent neurointerventional procedures during COVID-19 pandemic: recommendations on the Scientific Department on Cerebrovascular Diseases of the Brazilian Academy of Neurology, Brazilian Society of Cerebrovascular Diseases a",2020,"RATIONALE: Chest computed tomography (CT) scans play a key role in diagnosing and managing of COVID-19 pneumonia. The typical manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia on a chest CT scan are ground glass opacities, consolidation, nodules, and linear opacities. It can be accompanied by a ""crazy-paving"" pattern, air bronchograms, pleural hypertrophy, and pleural effusion. However, no literature has reported a case with cavities in the lungs. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 34-year-old male patient complained of fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, diarrhea, headache, and dizziness for 2 weeks. This patient is living in Xiaogan, a city around Wuhan, and he had contact with a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia from Wuhan <14 days before he had fever. DIAGNOSIS: A nucleic acid test by rRT-PCR returned positive on a pharyngeal swab, confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS: Isolation antiviral treatment. OUTCOMES: After 19 days of isolation and antiviral treatment, his temperature returned to normal and the symptoms were relieved. The laboratory results also were returning to normal levels. The chest CT scan showed that the acute inflammation had subsided significantly. With 2 consecutive novel coronavirus nucleic acid tests had returned negative, the patient was discharged from the hospital and sent to a government designated hotel for quarantine observation. The unique chest CT manifestation in this case was the small cavities in both lungs during the absorption phase of this disease. These small cavities developed into consolidated nodules with clear edges and gradually shrank or disappeared. LESSONS: Although 2 consecutive nucleic acid tests returned negative in this patient, the small cavity changes in the lungs were observed, so the patient was quarantined for 14 days. However, follow-up CT after the first 14 days' quarantine showed new small cavity changes on the lungs, a further 14 days of quarantine was recommended. Therefore, in some COVID-19 cases, even if the nucleic acid tests turns negative, the disappearance of lung lesions may take a long time. The repeated chest CT scan plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of the recovery of COVID-19.","Chen, Jinqing; Peng, Song; Zhang, Bangjun; Liu, Zhifeng; Liu, Lang; Zhang, Wendy",Medicine (Baltimore),,478

422084,Functional movement disorders in a patient with COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE: To assess the long-term results after Rex bypass (RB) shunt and Rex transposition (RT) shunt and determine the optimal approach. METHODS: Between 2010 and 2019, traditional RB shunt was performed in 24 patients, and modified RT shunt was performed in 23 children with extrahepatic portal hypertension (pHTN). A retrospective study was conducted based on comparative symptoms, platelet counts, color Doppler ultrasonography and computed tomographic portography of the portal system, and gastroscopic gastroesophageal varices postoperatively. The portal venous pressure was evaluated intraoperatively. RESULTS: The operation in the RB group was notably more time-consuming than that in the RT group (P < 0.05). Compared to RT shunt, the reduction in gastroesophageal varix grading, the increases in platelets, and the caliber of the bypass were greater in the RB group (P < 0.05). Although not statistically significant, higher morbidity of surgical complications was found after RT shunt (17.4%) compared with RB shunt (8.3%) with patency rates of 82.6 and 91.7%, respectively. Additionally, patients exhibited a lower rate of rebleeding under the RB procedure (12.5%) than under the RT procedure (21.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The RT procedure is an alternative option for the treatment of pediatric extrahepatic pHTN, and RB shunt is the preferred procedure in our center.","Zhang, Yu-Qing; Wang, Qing; Wu, Mei; Ruan, Zheng -Min; Li, Ya; Wei, Xiu -Liang; Zhang, Fei-Xue; Li, Yan; Shao, Guang-Rui; Xiao, Juan",Pediatr. surg. int,,478
422819,Rapid ramp-up of powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) training for infection prevention and control during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Traditional vaccines against viruses are designed to target their surface proteins, i.e., antigens, which can trigger the immune system to produce specific antibodies to capture and neutralize the viruses. However, viruses often evolve quickly, and their antigens are prone to mutations to avoid recognition by the antibodies (antigenic drift). This limitation of the antibody-mediated immunity could be addressed by the T-cell mediated immunity, which is able to recognize conserved viral HLA peptides presented on virus-infected cells. Thus, by targeting conserved regions on the genome of a virus, T-cell epitope-based vaccines are less subjected to mutations and may work effectively on different strains of the virus. Here we propose a personalized workflow to identify an optimal set of T-cell epitopes based on the HLA alleles and the immunopeptidome of an individual person. Specifically, our workflow trains a machine learning model on the immunopeptidome and then predicts HLA peptides from conserved regions of a virus that are most likely to trigger responses from the person T cells. We applied the workflow to identify T-cell epitopes for the SARS-COV-2 virus, which has caused the recent COVID-19 pandemic in more than 100 countries across the globe.","Qiao, Rui; Tran, Ngoc Hieu; Shan, Baozhen; Ghodsi, Ali; Li, Ming",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10650v1.pdf,478

423250,Telehealth to expand access of oncology care in Utah during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore the need for a strong health system for the social protection of people and to improve health programme implementation in the coming years. India has made great progress in health over the past 50 years;however, despite the progress made, it is faced with several challenges. While infectious diseases remain an unfinished agenda, chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are rising and are now the leading cause of mortality in the country. This is further compounded by the prevailing inequalities in access to quality health care among population groups including those living in remote rural areas. To achieve Universal Health Coverage and Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, India in 2017 revised its National Health Policy and committed itself to attain the highest possible level of good health and well-being, through preventive and promotive health interventions. While policies are enunciated and plans are formulated, the implementation at ground level is at best tardy and lack lustre As an administrative unit for programme implementation, a district has a key role to play in implementing national programmes and in delivery of basic health services to the people. They are strategically placed to plan, organise and lead efforts meant to deliver primary health care services through better management of existing resources and by fully engaging all relevant stakeholders in contributing towards achievement of national health goals and in responding to a public health emergency such as Covid-19. Planning and managing health problems need an improved and responsive health governance. Strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation require integration and coordination of various health programmes including dealing with health crises, fostering inter-sectoral involvement and engagement of the community as a key actor. Efforts are needed to ensure that services reach the most vulnerable and marginalised sections of the society. Adequate governance support at district level through a whole-of-society approach is essential to bridge the health inequities and ensure equitable access to health services.","Natasha, Dawa Thelma Narayan Narain J.

423630,Health care system and COVID-19 policies in Okayama Prefecture,2020,"PURPOSE: This article assesses the relative efficacy and safety of infliximab biosimilars in treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: A frequentist, random-effects network meta-analysis was performed to evaluate evidence from randomized controlled trials that examined the use of infliximab biosimilars for treatment of patients with RA. PubMed/MEDLINE and other sources were searched for reports evaluating rates of response to treatment with the reference product (infliximab) vs an infliximab biosimilar. The primary efficacy outcome of interest was the rate of attainment of ACR20 (ie, 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology core measures). The primary safety outcome was the rate of treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs). Data were extracted by the primary author, and an assessment for risks of methodological bias was performed for each evaluated study. RESULTS: Five studies that enrolled a total of 2,499 patients were included. Overall comparisons using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) did not indicate statistically significant differences in response to treatment with biosimilar agents relative to each other or the infliximab reference product. ORs for ACR20 response for biosimilars vs infliximab were as follows: 1.475 (95% CI, 0.940-2.315) for infliximab-axxq, 1.259 (95% CI, 0.854-1.855) for infliximab-dyyb, 0.865 (95% CI, 0.5511.358) for infliximab-qbtx, and 0.832 (95% CI, 0.506-1.367) for infliximab-abda. Similar findings were observed in reported SAE rates among patients treated with the various biosimilars. CONCLUSION: ACR20 response appears to be comparable and nonsignificantly different between infliximab biosimilars. In the absence of any meaningful differences in safety or efficacy, biosimilar cost may be the deciding factor in choosing a treatment or agent for formulary inclusion.","Hanrahan, Conor; Lee, Todd",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,478
423813,Management of patients with liver derangement during the COVID-19 pandemic: an Asia-Pacific position statement,2020,"Palmar erythema in children can be due to various reasons, such as chronic liver disease, rheumatological disorders, medications, irritant contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis. Recently, there are few reports about contact dermatitis caused by frequent, daily use of hand sanitizers during this COVID-19 pandemic. A 3-year-old toddler brought with the concern of waxing-waning bilateral palmar erythema for the past 2 weeks. The parents revealed that the child liked the bright color of a recently bought hand sanitizer bottle so much he used to wash his hands every 20-30 min throughout the day. The atypical presentation of contact dermatitis might be because the child was using the sanitizer more frequently during the daytime. The dermatitis resolved with stopping excessive use of the hand sanitizer by the toddler. Clinicians should be aware of contact dermatitis during these pandemic times. Instead of investigating them extensively, careful history taking and merely advising them to judicially utilize the sanitizer can lead to complete reversal of symptoms.","Panda, Prateek Kumar; Sharawat, Indar Kumar",J. trop. pedriatr,,478

The community of Castile and León in Spain is one of the most affected by COVID-19 infection and the province of León has a total of 3711 cases and 425 deaths so far. Rheumatic patients should be given special attention regarding COVID-19 infection due to their immunocompromised state resulting from their underlying immune conditions and use of targeted immune-modulating therapies. Studying epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with rheumatic diseases infected with SARS-CoV2 is pivotal to clarify determinants of COVID-19 disease severity in patients with underlying rheumatic disease. OBJECTIVES: To describe epidemiological characteristics of patients with rheumatic diseases hospitalized with COVID-19 and determine risk factors associated with mortality in a third level Hospital setting in León, Spain. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study, from 1st March 2020 until the 1st of June including adults with rheumatic diseases hospitalized with COVID-19 and performed a univariate and multivariate logistic regression model to estimate ORs and 95% CIs of mortality. Age, sex, comorbidities, rheumatic disease diagnosis and treatment, disease activity prior to infection, radiographic and laboratorial results at arrival were analysed. RESULTS: During the study period, 3711 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital, of whom 38 (10%) had a rheumatic or musculoskeletal disease. Fifty-three percent were women, with a mean age at hospital admission of 75.3 (IQR 68-83) years. The median length of stay was 11 days. A total of 10 patients died (26%) during their hospital admission. Patients who died from COVID-19 were older (median age 78.4 IQR 74.5-83.5) than those who survived COVID-19 (median age 75.1 IQR 69.3-75.8) and more likely to have arterial hypertension (9 [90%] vs 14 [50%] patients; OR 9 (95% CI 1.0-80.8), p 0.049), dyslipidaemia (9 (90%) vs 12 (43%); OR 12 (95% CI 1.33-108), p 0.03), diabetes ((9 (90%) vs 6 (28%) patients; OR 33, p 0.002), interstitial lung disease (6 (60%) vs 6 (21%); OR 5.5 (95% CI 1.16-26), p 0.03), cardiovascular disease (8 (80%) vs 11 (39%); OR 6.18 (95% IC 1.10-34.7, p 0.04) and a moderate/high index of rheumatic disease activity (7 (25%) vs 6(60%); OR 41.4 (4.23-405.23), p 0.04). In univariate analyses, we also found that patients who died from COVID-19 had higher hyperinflammation markers than patients who survived: C-reactive protein (181 (IQR 120-220) vs 107.4 (IQR 30-150; p 0.05); lactate dehydrogenase (641.8 (IQR 465.75-853.5) vs 361 (IQR 250-450), p 0.03); serum ferritin (1026 (IQR 228.3-1536.3) vs 861.3 (IQR 389-1490.5), p 0.04); D-dimer (12,019.8 (IQR 843.5-25,790.5) vs 1544.3 (IQR 619-1622), p 0.04). No differences in sex, radiological abnormalities, rheumatological disease, background therapy or symptoms before admission between deceased patients and survivors were found. In the multivariate analysis, the following risk factors were associated with mortality: rheumatic disease activity (p = 0.003), dyslipidaemia (p = 0.01), cardiovascular disease (p = 0.02) and interstitial lung disease (p = 0.02). Age, hypertension and diabetes were significant predictors in univariate but not in multivariate analysis. Rheumatic disease activity was significantly associated with fever (p = 0.05), interstitial lung disease (p = 0.03), cardiovascular disease (p = 0.03) and dyslipidaemia (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that comorbidities, rheumatic disease activity and laboratorial abnormalities such as C-reactive protein (CRP), D-Dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum ferritin elevation significantly associated with mortality whereas previous use of rheumatic medication did not. Inflammation is closely related to severity of COVID-19. Key Points â¢ Most patients recover from COVID-19. â¢ The use of DMARDs, corticosteroids and biologic agents did not increase the odds of mortality in our study. â¢ Rheumatic disease activity might be associated with mortality.","Santos, C Sieiro; Morales, C Moriano; Álvarez, E Díez; Castro, C Álvarez; Robles, A López; Sandoval, T Perez",Clin Rheumatol,,478

The main objective of this study was to determine the incidence of these infections in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHOD: Retrospective observational study of all patients admitted for COVID-19 and bacterial/fungal infections at the Hospital Clínico Universitario of Valladolid, Spain (March 1-May 31, 2020). Demographic, clinical and microbiological data were compared based on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and predictors of mortality by were identified using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 712 COVID-19 patients, 113 (16%) presented bacterial/fungal coinfections or superinfections. Their median age was 73 years (IQR 57-89) and 59% were men. The profiles of ICU patients (44%) included male, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, leukocytosis, elevated inteleukin-6, with interferon ß-1b and tocilizumab and superinfection (p < 0.05). Coinfections were diagnosed in 5% (39/712) patients. Most common pathogens of respiratory coinfection (18) were Streptococcus pneumoniae (6) and Staphylococcus aureus (6).

Through a genomic epidemiology study based on 250 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from different Amazonas municipalities sampled between March 2020 and January 2021, we reveal that the first exponential growth phase was driven mostly by the dissemination of lineage B.1.195, which was gradually replaced by lineage B.1.1.28 between May and June 2020. The second wave coincides with the emergence of the variant of concern (VOC) P.1, which evolved from a local B.1.1.28 clade in late November 2020 and replaced the parental lineage in <2 months. Our findings support the conclusion that successive lineage replacements in Amazonas were driven by a complex combination of variable levels of social distancing measures and the emergence of a more transmissible VOC P.1 virus. These data provide insights to understanding the mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 epidemic waves and the risk of dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 VOC P.1 in Brazil and, potentially, worldwide.","Naveca, Felipe Gomes; Nascimento, Valdinete; de Souza, Victor Costa; Corado, André de Lima; Nascimento, Fernanda; Silva, George; Costa, Ágatha; Duarte, Débora; Pessoa, Karina; Mejía, Matilde; Brandão, Maria Júlia; Jesus, Michele; Gonçalves, Luciana; da Costa, Cristiano Fernandes; Sampaio, Vanderson; Barros, Daniel; Silva, Marineide; Mattos, Tirza; Pontes, Gemilson; Abdalla, Ligia; Santos, João Hugo; Arantes, Ighor; Dezordi, Filipe Zimmer; Siqueira, Marilda Mendonça; Wallau, Gabriel Luz; Resende, Paola Cristina; Delatorre, Edson; Gräf, Tiago; Bello, Gonzalo",Nat Med,,478

428509,Cutaneous Manifestations of COVID-19 in the Inpatient Setting,2021,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore family medicine graduates' attitudes and perspectives on modifiable and unmodifiable factors that influenced their scope of practice and career choices. By understanding how these factors intersect to influence desired and actual scope of practice decisions, we hope to inform strategies to address training and health care workforce needs. METHODS: During 5 focus group discussions, comprised of a total of 32 family physicians who either resided in or attended a residency program in western North Carolina, we explored family physicians' attitudes and perspectives on their desired and actual scope of practice. We used thematic analysis to identify patterns in the qualitative data. RESULTS: We created a conceptual framework to understand the complex factors which influence family physicians' scope of practice. Personal factors were found to impact desired scope, while workplace, environmental, and population factors influenced actual scope of practice. Stressors in each of these 4 categories often caused family physicians to narrow their scope of practice. Our study highlights specific supports that, if in place, enable physicians to maintain their desired broad scope of practice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the national trend toward family physicians narrowing their scope of practice can be addressed by providing specific supports during training, residency, and mid-career. Understanding personal, workplace, environmental, and population factors that influence scope of practice can inform specific interventions that create desirable jobs for family physicians and improve their ability to meet changing population needs.","Russell, Amy; Fromewick, Jill; Macdonald, Brittney; Kimmel, Stephen; Franke, Kara; Leach, Kimberly; Foley, Kathy",Ann Fam Med,,478

Unfortunately, due to the high infectiousness of the novel beta-coronavirus, it is very likely to become an ordinary epidemic. The development of dietary supplements and functional foods might provide a strategy for the prevention and management of COVID-19. Scope and Approach: A great diversity of potential edible and medicinal plants and/or natural compounds showed potential benefits in managing SARS, which may also combat COVID-19. Moreover, many plants and compounds have currently been proposed to be protective against COVID-19. This information is based on data-driven approaches and computational chemical biology techniques. In this study, we review promising candidates of edible and medicinal plants for the prevention and management of COVID-19. We primarily focus on analyzing their underlying mechanisms. We aim to identify dietary supplements and functional foods that assist in managing this epidemic. Key findings and Conclusion: We infer that acetoside, glyasperin, isorhamnetin, and several flavonoid compounds may prevent and/or be effective in managing COVID-19 by targeting the viral infection, reducing the host cytokine storm, regulating the immune response, and providing organ protection. These bioactive dietary components (used either alone or in combination) might assist in the development of dietary supplements or functional foods for managing COVID-19.","Li, S.; Cheng, C.

429076,Neurological manifestations in COVID-19: an overview,2021,"Given that conventional therapies are ineffective for COVID-19, obtained exosomes from stem cells have been proposed as a sustainable and effective treatment. Exosomes are subsets with lengths between 30 and 100 nanometers, and they can be secreted by different cells. Exosomes are containing different types of miRNAs, mRNAs, and different proteins. The role of immune system modulation of exosomes of mesenchymal stem cells has been studied and confirmed in more than one study. Exosome miRNAs detect and reduce cytokines that cause cytokine storms such as IL-7, IL-2, IL-6, etc. These miRNAs include miR-21, miR-24, miR-124, miR-145, etc. The risks associated with treatment with exosomes from different cells are relatively small compared to other treatments because transplanted cells do not stimulate the host immune system and also has reduced infection transmission. Due to the ineffectiveness of existing drugs in reducing inflammation and preventing cytokine storms, the use of immune-boosting systems may be suggested as another way to control cytokine storm.","Kheirkhah, Amir Hossein; Shahcheraghi, Seyed Hossein; Lotfi, Malihe; Lotfi, Marzieh; Raeisi, Sanaz; Mirani, Zulfiqar",,,478

An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV protein. The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire. We show that a 9-amino-acid peptide NP44-52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a conserved region of EBOV NP provides protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge. A single vaccination in a C57BL/6 mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8+ T-cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually sound and feasible. Nucleocapsid proteins within SARS-CoV-2 contain multiple Class I epitopes with predicted HLA restrictions consistent with broad population coverage.

METHODS: Using data from China (training dataset, n = 96), prediction models were developed by logistic regression and then risk scores were established. Leave-one-out cross validation was used for internal validation and data from Iran (test dataset, n = 43) was used for external validation. RESULTS: A NSL model (area under the curve (AUC) 0.932) and a NL model (AUC 0.903) were developed based on neutrophil percentage and lactate dehydrogenase with and without oxygen saturation (SaO2) using the training dataset. AUCs of the NSL and NL models in the test dataset were 0.910 and 0.871, respectively. The risk scoring systems corresponding to these two models were established. The AUCs of the NSL and NL scores in the training dataset were 0.928 and 0.901, respectively. At the optimal cut-off value of NSL score, the sensitivity and specificity were 94% and 82%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of NL score were 94% and 75%, respectively.

431440,Differential diagnoses of severe COVID-19 in tropical areas: the experience of Reunion Island,2020,"The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has motivated an intensive analysis of its molecular epidemiology following its worldwide spread. To understand the early evolutionary events following its emergence, a data set of 985 complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences was assembled. Variants showed a mean of 5.5 to 9.5 nucleotide differences from each other, consistent with a midrange coronavirus substitution rate of 3 × 10-4 substitutions/site/year. Almost one-half of sequence changes were CâU transitions, with an 8-fold base frequency normalized directional asymmetry between CâU and UâC substitutions. Elevated ratios were observed in other recently emerged coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]-CoV), and decreasing ratios were observed in other human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, -OC43, -229E, and -HKU1) proportionate to their increasing divergence. CâU transitions underpinned almost one-half of the amino acid differences between SARS-CoV-2 variants and occurred preferentially in both 5' U/A and 3' U/A flanking sequence contexts comparable to favored motifs of human APOBEC3 proteins. Marked base asymmetries observed in nonpandemic human coronaviruses (U â« A > G â« C) and low G+C contents may represent long-term effects of prolonged CâU hypermutation in their hosts. The evidence that much of sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses may be driven by a host APOBEC-like editing process has profound implications for understanding their short- and long-term evolution. Repeated cycles of mutation and reversion in favored mutational hot spots and the widespread occurrence of amino acid changes with no adaptive value for the virus represent a quite different paradigm of virus sequence change from neutral and Darwinian evolutionary frameworks and are not incorporated by standard models used in molecular epidemiology investigations.IMPORTANCE The wealth of accurately curated sequence data for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), its long genome, and its low substitution rate provides a relatively blank canvas with which to investigate effects of mutational and editing processes imposed by the host cell. The finding that a large proportion of sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 in the initial months of the pandemic comprised CâU mutations in a host APOBEC-like context provides evidence for a potent host-driven antiviral editing mechanism against coronaviruses more often associated with antiretroviral defense. In evolutionary terms, the contribution of biased, convergent, and context-dependent mutations to sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 is substantial, and these processes are not incorporated by standard models used in molecular epidemiology investigations.","Simmonds, P",MSphere,,478

However, it is challenging to conduct multiple user tests because of the significant burden on the elderly; thus, we need efficient ways to extract insight through different approaches. In this study, we aim to elucidate real-time transitions in users' emotions and achievement motivation while using such a device. We synthesize an utterance analysis method based on attribution theory, in which all users' utterances are attributed to four categories (ability, effort, task difficulty, and luck) that follow the developed coding rules. Knowing the transitions in causal attribution allows us to extract salient experiences for users, especially by extracting shifts from them and analyzing why the shift occurred and what exactly was happening before and after the shift. If only salient user experiences can be referenced from the aggregate data, useful information can be extracted in a short time to improve system characteristics and the environment. We discussed the validity and reliability of the proposed method by conducting a user test of an electric-assisted four-wheeled cycle for frail elderly people in Kakegawa city in Shizuoka, Japan. We also succeeded in marking the points that need attention, which is about 33% of the total amount of utterance data (1626 utterances), and thus confirmed the potential of the proposed method. Future research should examine how the developed methodology can help designers improve assistive device development, as well as how it can contribute to other fields such as education and social assistance.","Ohashi, Takumi; Watanabe, Makiko; Takenaka, Yuma; Saijo, Miki",Integr. psychol. behav. sci,,478
432045,A complex intervention to improve anxiety in people with systemic sclerosis during COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The first cases of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus were reported in China in December 2019. The disease has since spread globally. Many countries have instated measures to slow the spread of the virus. Information about the spread of the virus in a country can inform the gradual reopening of a country and help to avoid a second wave of infections. Our study focuses on Denmark, which is opening up when this study is performed (end-May 2020) after a lockdown in mid-March. METHODS: We perform a phylogenetic analysis of 742 publicly available Danish SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and put them into context using sequences from other countries. RESULTS: Our findings are consistent with several introductions of the virus to Denmark from independent sources. We identify several chains of mutations that occurred in Denmark. In at least one case we find evidence that the virus spread from Denmark to other countries. A number of the mutations found in Denmark are non-synonymous, and in general there is a considerable variety of strains. The proportions of the most common haplotypes remain stable after lockdown. CONCLUSION: Employing phylogenetic methods on Danish genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2, we exemplify how genetic data can be used to trace the introduction of a virus to a country. This provides alternative means for verifying existing assumptions. For example, our analysis supports the hypothesis that the virus was brought to Denmark by skiers returning from Ischgl. On the other hand, we identify transmission routes which suggest that Denmark was part of a network of countries among which the virus was being transmitted. This challenges the common narrative that Denmark only got infected from abroad. Our analysis concerning the ratio of haplotypes does not indicate that the major haplotypes appearing in Denmark have a different degree of virality.","Bluhm, Andreas; Christandl, Matthias; Gesmundo, Fulvio; Ravn Klausen, Frederik; Mancinska, Laura; Steffan, Vincent; Stilck França, Daniel; Werner, Albert H",PLoS One,,478

As an application we introduce a bidimensional index that simultaneously measures relative inequality and dissimilarity between two populations. This proposal employs the Gini indices of the variables and an $L^1$-distance between their Lorenz curves. The index takes values in a right-angled triangle, two of whose sides characterize perfect relative inequality-expressed by the Lorenz ordering between the underlying distributions. Further, the hypotenuse represents maximal distance between the two distributions. As a consequence, we construct a chart to, graphically, either see the evolution of (relative) inequality and distance between two income distributions over time or to compare the distribution of income of a specific population between a fixed time point and a range of years. We prove the mathematical results behind the above claims and provide a full description of the asymptotic properties of the plug-in estimator of this index. Finally, we apply the proposed bidimensional index to several real EU-SILC income datasets to illustrate its performance in practice.","Ba'illo, Amparo; C'arcamo, Javier; Mora-Corral, Carlos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03286v1.pdf,478

Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable groups of people is crucial for the adaptation of governments’ responses. Growing scientific evidence suggests that it is essential to keep the attention on people after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection;indeed, some clinical manifestations are frequently present even after recovery. There is consensus on the need to define which symptoms persist after the infection and which disabilities may arise after COVID-19. Recent reviews, case reports, and original contributions suggest that various organs may be affected, and neurological symptoms are present in about one third of patients with COVID-19. Neurological complications after severe COVID-19 infection might include delirium, brain inflammation, stroke, and nerve damage.

Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is a human protease required for SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral entry and may represent such a target. We hypothesized that drugs selected from proteins related by their tertiary structure, rather than their primary structure, were likely to interact with TMPRSS2. We created a structure-based phylogenetic computational tool named 3DPhyloFold to systematically identify structurally similar serine proteases with known therapeutic inhibitors and demonstrated effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo. Several candidate compounds, avoralstat, PCI-27483, antipain, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, inhibited TMPRSS2 in biochemical and cell infection assays. Avoralstat, a clinically tested kallikrein-related B1 inhibitor, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in human airway epithelial cells. In an in vivo proof of principle, avoralstat significantly reduced lung tissue titers and mitigated weight loss when administered prophylactically to mice susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, indicating its potential to be repositioned for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prophylaxis in humans.","Sun, Young Joo; Velez, Gabriel; Parsons, Dylan E; Li, Kun; Ortiz, Miguel E; Sharma, Shaunik; McCray, Paul B; Bassuk, Alexander G; Mahajan, Vinit B",J. clin. invest,,478

435827,A new Editor: A fresh beginning on our 25th anniversary,2021,"This study aimed to examine the factors associated with body dissatisfaction in adolescents. This is a cross-sectional study with students from two public and four private schools in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. Body dissatisfaction was evaluated using the Body Silhouette Scale, by the difference between the image they perceive as their current image and the one they would like to have. The association was assessed by hierarchical logistic regression multinomial model, by estimating odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Among the 1,019 adolescents evaluated (13-19 years), 75% showed body dissatisfaction, 41.4% wishing for a smaller silhouette and 33.7% wishing for larger silhouettes. The wish for a smaller silhouette was more significant in girls, overweight adolescents, those with an unsatisfactory meal pattern, and with higher waist circumference. Adolescents that had been exposed to teasing due to their body shape increased the probability of wishing for both smaller and larger silhouettes. Strategies are required for a more positive perception of body image, especially for girls and for overweight adolescents, which provide guidance on adequate meal consumption and prevent exposure to peer teasing, valuing coexistence and well-being in the face of existing bodily differences.","Carvalho, Giulia Xavier de; Nunes, Ana Paula Nogueira; Moraes, Claudia Leite; Veiga, Gloria Valeria da",Cien Saude Colet,,478
435866,Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS): A Review and Focus on Considerations for COVID-19,2020,"The zoonotic transmission of highly pathogenic coronaviruses into the human population is a pressing concern highlighted by the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Recent work has helped to illuminate much about the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell, which determines host- and tissue-specific tropism, pathogenicity, and zoonotic transmission. Here we discuss current findings on the factors governing SARS-CoV-2 entry. We first reviewed key features of the viral spike protein (S) mediating fusion of the viral envelope and host cell membrane through binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We then examined the roles of host proteases including transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsins in processing S for virus entry and the impact of this processing on endosomal and plasma membrane virus entry routes. We further discussed recent work on several host cofactors that enhance SARS-CoV-2 entry including Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), CD147, phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), sialic acid residues, and C-type lectins. Finally, we discussed two key host restriction factors, i.e., interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins and lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus E (Ly6E), which can disrupt SARS-CoV-2 entry. The features of SARS-CoV-2 are presented in the context of other human coronaviruses, highlighting unique aspects. Additionally, we identify the gaps in understanding of SARS-CoV-2 entry that will need to be addressed by future studies.","Evans, John P; Liu, Shan-Lu",J Biol Chem,,478

However, the clinical relevance of &#945;-l-fucosidase, the enzyme for defucosylation has not been discovered. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 585 COVID-19 patients were included to analyze the correlations of &#945;-l-fucosidase activity with the nucleic acid test, IgM/IgG, comorbidities, and disease progression. RESULTS: Among the COVID-19 patients, 5.75% were double-negative for nucleic acid and antibodies. All of them had increased &#945;-l-fucosidase, while only one had abnormal serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The abnormal rate of &#945;-l-fucosidase was 81.82% before the presence of IgM, 100% in the presence of IgM, and 66.2% in the presence of IgG. 73.42% of patients with glucometabolic disorders had increased &#945;-l-fucosidase activity and had the highest mortality of 6.33%. The increased &#945;-l-fucosidase was observed in 55.8% of non-severe cases and 72.9% of severe cases, with an odds ratio of 2.118. The &#945;-l-fucosidase mRNA was irrelevant to its serum activity. CONCLUSION: The change in &#945;-l-fucosidase activity in COVID-19 preceded the IgM and SAA and showed a preferable relation with glucometabolic disorders, which may be conducive to virus invasion or invoke an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.","Liang, En-Yu; Li, Guo-Hua; Wang, Wen-Gong; Qiu, Xin-Min; Ke, Pei-Feng; He, Min; Huang, Xian-Zhang",Clin Chim Acta,,478

Within no time, once-bustling university classrooms were compelled to move online, leaving educators to rely on virtual engagement tools. This in turn heightened the impact of virtual professional development in higher education, not just nationally but also internationally. As we look toward finding means to engage students in effective classroom instruction, there remain parts of the globe that are making this transition to online instruction without cutting-edge technologies. This article highlights the importance of engaging educators in virtual professional development activities as part of international outreach and details one author's experience using the Avida-ED platform for a novel international teaching partnership. Traditionally, international outreach activities have been pursued through distinct platforms, like Fulbright programs, sabbaticals, and other international collaborations. The ongoing pandemic presents a unique opportunity to propagate professional development activities on a virtual platform by emphasizing scientific teaching practices as they relate to the STEM fields. If undertaken, these endeavors ultimately benefit educators across the globe by not only equipping them with various pedagogical tools and resources for their online instruction but also by establishing international partnerships and collaborations.","Morra, C.

Monitoring and treatment of PKU patients can be complicated in challenging circumstances as pandemics. This study aims to evaluate the impact of telemedicine for monitoring and treatment of PKU patients on metabolic outcome during coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak. Materials and Methods: Patients who were diagnosed as PKU and treated with low Phe diet, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), or BH4 adjunct with low Phe diet were enrolled. Study period was divided into two periods: prepandemic period wherein patients were followed up in outpatients' clinic and during pandemic wherein telemedicine was used. Demographic findings, laboratory results, and therapy responses were reviewed retrospectively and compared between the two periods. All procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the local ethical committee of Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty (17/11/2020-151640) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2013. Results: Ninety-three (n = 93) patients were enrolled to this study. The ratio of the samples with Phe levels in the recommended ranges was found to be statistically higher during the pandemic wherein an online monitoring system was used in all treatment modalities (p < 0.05). The decrease in Phe washout frequency was statistically significant during the pandemic in the low Phe diet group (p < 0.05). Considering the relationship between Phe tolerance before and during the pandemic, a significant increase in Phe tolerance was noted during the pandemic in the low Phe diet group (p < 0.05).

438651,Nephrotoxicity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about the potential decrease in access and utilisation of general practice services and its impact on patient care. In March 2020, the Australian Government introduced telehealth services to ensure that people more vulnerable to COVID-19 do not delay routine care from their general practitioners. Evidence about patients' experience of telehealth and its impact on patient care is scarce. This study aimed to investigate the experience with telehealth by Australian general practice patients at high risk of poor health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 30 patients from nine general practices in metropolitan Adelaide (May-June 2020). Participants were identified by their regular doctor as being at high risk of poor health outcomes. Interviews sought participants' perspectives and experiences about telehealth services in the general practice setting during COVID-19, and the value of offering continued telehealth services post pandemic. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a coding structure developed based on deductive codes derived from the research questions and any additional concepts that emerged inductively from interviews. RESULTS: Participants expressed satisfaction with telehealth including convenient and timely access to general practice services. Yet, participants identified challenges including difficulties in expressing themselves and accessing physical exams. Prescription renewal, discussing test results and simple follow-ups were the most common reasons that telehealth was used. Telehealth was mainly via phone that better suited those with low digital literacy. Participants indicated that an existing doctor-patient relationship was important for telehealth services to be effective. Subjects believed that telehealth services should be continued but needed to be combined with opportunities for face-to-face consultations after the COVID-19 pandemic was over. CONCLUSIONS: The expansion of telehealth supported access to general practice including chronic disease management during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the future, telehealth in Australia is likely to have a stronger place in primary healthcare policy and practice and an increased acceptance amongst patients.","Javanparast, Sara; Roeger, Leigh; Kwok, Yuen; Reed, Richard L",BMC Fam Pract,,478

The education sector was among many which had taken a strong blow due to pandemic. In the wake of institute shut down, this was a challenging time for professional education which was combated through introduction of e-learning through online classes so as to ensure continuation of teaching-learning process for the medical students. Aims and Objectives: The aim of the study was to rank the effectiveness and satisfaction of online classes compared to classroom conventional teaching among medical students. Materials and Methods: After the Institutional Ethical Clearance, this online cross-sectional survey study was done on medical students. A total of 983 students participated in this study. This online survey was carried out from April 10, 2020, to April 18, 2020, after completion of 3 weeks of online classes. A set of self-designed questionnaire based on 5-point Likert scale was given to the students, to rank the effectiveness of learning through e-classes and their understanding with the satisfaction level on various parameters. This was pre-tested on 20 students for standardization. All the students voluntarily participated in the survey. Results: The study result shows that online classes were equally effective in five parameters and less effective in the other but were not at all superior than the conventional classroom teachings. We could come to an interpretation that students were not much satisfied with this way of teaching but definitely it was the need of the hour. Conclusion: We could conclude from our study that e-education can supplement the process of present education, but it cannot be a substitute for the established system of education.","Kaur, Nimarpreet; Dwivedi, Deepti; Arora, Jyoti; Gandhi, Asha",Natl.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of a urinary tract infection (UTI) pocket card on preferred antibiotic prescribing for patients discharged from the emergency department (ED) with a diagnosis of cystitis. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective, pre-post study was conducted to compare outcomes following the introduction of a UTI pocket card. The primary outcome was prescribing rates for institutional first-line preferred antibiotics (cephalexin and nitrofurantoin) versus other antimicrobials for cystitis. Secondary outcomes included prescriber adherence to recommended therapy in regards to discharge dose, frequency, duration, and healthcare utilization rates. RESULTS: The study included 915 patients in total, 407 in the preintervention group and 508 in the postintervention group. The frequency of preferred antibiotic prescribing was significantly increased after the introduction of a UTI pocket card compared to prior to its introduction (81.7% vs 72.0%, P = 0.001). Significant increases in prescribing of an appropriate antibiotic dose (78.0% vs 66.8%, P < 0.0001) and frequency (64.2% vs 47.4%, P < 0.0001) were also found post intervention. No significant differences were seen between the pre- and postintervention groups with regards to healthcare utilization rates. CONCLUSION: A UTI pocket card increased preferred antibiotic prescribing for cystitis in the ED. This study provides data on a successful antimicrobial stewardship intervention in the ED setting.","Mixon, Mark Anthony; Dietrich, Scott; Bushong, Benjamin; Peksa, Gary; Rogoszewski, Ryan; Theiler, Alexander; Spears, Lindsey; Werth, Joshua; Meister, Erin; Martin, Matthew Steven",Am. j. health system pharm,,478
439286,Retrospective analysis of NGS data in pediatric genetic cohort: detection of rare variants that may impact influenza and COVID-19 infection,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically impacted work, economy, and way of life. Sensitive measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies would provide new insight into pre-existing immunity, virus transmission dynamics, and the nuances of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. To date, existing SARS-CoV-2 serology tests have limited utility due to insufficient reliable detection of antibody levels lower than what is typically present after several days of symptoms. To measure lower quantities of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA with higher resolution than existing assays, we developed a new ELISA protocol with a distinct plate washing procedure and timed plate development via use of a standard curve. Very low optical densities from samples added to buffer coated wells at as low as a 1:5 dilution are reported using this 'BU ELISA' method. Use of this method revealed circulating SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N) reactive antibodies (IgG, IgM, and/or IgA) in 44 and 100 percent of pre-pandemic subjects, respectively, and the magnitude of these antibodies tracked with antibody levels of analogous viral proteins from endemic coronavirus (eCoV) strains. The disease status (HIV, SLE) of unexposed subjects was not linked with SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibody levels; however, quantities were significantly lower in subjects over 70 years of age compared with younger counterparts. Also, we measured SARS-CoV-2 RBD- and N- specific IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies from 29 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals at varying disease states, including 10 acute COVID-19 hospitalized subjects with negative serology results by the EUA approved Abbott IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RBD- and N- specific IgM, IgG, IgA levels measured by the BU ELISA revealed higher signal from 9 of the 10 Abbott test negative COVID-19 subjects than all pre-pandemic samples for at least one antibody specificity/isotype, implicating improved serologic identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection via multi-parameter, high sensitive antibody detection. We propose that this improved ELISA protocol, which is straightforward to perform, low cost, and uses readily available commercial reagents, is a useful tool to elucidate new information about SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunity and has promising implications for improved detection of all analytes measurable by this platform.","Yuen, Rachel R; Steiner, Dylan; Pihl, Riley M F; Chavez, Elizabeth; Olson, Alex; Smith, Erika L; Baird, Lillia A; Korkmaz, Filiz; Urick, Patricia; Sagar, Manish; Berrigan, Jacob L; Gummuluru, Suryaram; Corley, Ronald B; Quillen, Karen; Belkina, Anna C; Mostoslavsky, Gustavo; Rifkin, Ian R; Kataria, Yachana; Cappione, Amedeo J; Gao, Wenda; Lin, Nina H; Bhadelia, Nahid; Snyder-Cappione, Jennifer E",Front Immunol,,478

Among 76 outpatients participating in consecutive phase 2 CR in both periods from March to April and June to July 2020, which were before and after CR interruption, respectively, at Sanda City Hospital were enrolled. The inclusion criterion was outpatients whose CR was interrupted due to COVID-19. Patients under the age of 65 were excluded. We compared the data of hemodynamic response and RPE during exercise on the last day before interruption and the first day after interruption when aerobic exercise was performed at the same exercise intensity in the gardener group and the non-gardener group. Forty-one patients were enrolled in the final analysis. After CR interruption, the gardener group did not show any significant difference in all items, whereas the non-gardener group experienced significant increase in HR (Peak) (p = 0.004) and worsening of the Borg scale scores for both dyspnea and lower extremity fatigue (p = 0.039 and p = 0.009, respectively). Older phase 2 CR patients engaged in gardening did not show any deterioration in hemodynamic response or RPE during exercise, despite CR interruption and refraining from going outside.

Very little is known about the occurrence and characteristic of cardiac arrest in critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated at the intensive care unit (ICU). The aim was to investigate the incidence and outcome of intensive care unit cardiac arrest (ICU-CA) in critically ill patients with COVID-19. This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively recorded data of all consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 admitted (27 February 2020–14 January 2021) at the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf (Germany). Of 183 critically ill patients with COVID-19, 18% (n = 33) had ICU-CA. The median age of the study population was 63 (55–73) years and 66% (n = 120) were male. Demographic characteristics and comorbidities did not differ significantly between patients with and without ICU-CA. Simplified Acute Physiological Score II (SAPS II) (ICU-CA: median 44 points vs. no ICU-CA: 39 points) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (median 12 points vs. 7 points) on admission were significantly higher in patients with ICU-CA. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was present in 91% (n = 30) with and in 63% (n = 94) without ICU-CA (p = 0.002). Mechanical ventilation was more common in patients with ICU-CA (97% vs. 67%). The median stay in ICU before CA was 6 (1–17) days. A total of 33% (n = 11) of ICU-CAs occurred during the first 24 h of ICU stay. The initial rhythm was non-shockable (pulseless electrical activity (PEA)/asystole) in 91% (n = 30);94% (n = 31) had sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The median time to ROSC was 3 (1–5) minutes. Patients with ICU-CA had significantly higher ICU mortality (61% vs. 37%). Multivariable logistic regression showed that the presence of ARDS (odds ratio (OR) 4.268, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.211–15.036;p = 0.024) and high SAPS II (OR 1.031, 95% CI 0.997–1.065;p = 0.077) were independently associated with the occurrence of ICU-CA. A total of 18% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 suffered from a cardiac arrest within the intensive care unit.

Dezenove amostras tipificadas como variante foram submetidas ao seqüenciamento parcial da região codificadora da subunidade S1 e à análise genealógica. Considerando os pools de órgãos e de conteúdo entérico, 45,50% foram positivos para a presença de IBV, dos quais, 84,63% pertencem ao genotipo Variante e 9,89% ao sorotipo/genotipo Massachusetts. Considerando os lotes, 73,50% foram positivos para IBV, sendo 77,55% variantes e 6,12% Massachusetts. A análise genealógica revelou quatro linhagens virais, todas agrupadas em um exclusivo grupamento de genotipo brasileiro. Estes resultados demonstram que o IBV está disseminado em todas as regiões avícolas brasileiras, com um predomínio massivo de genotipos não Massachusetts e uma elevada diversidade molecular, que deve ser levada em consideração para desenvolver medidas preventivas contra o IBV","Sandri, Thaisa Lucas",,,478
441179,Experience of the Colentina Clinical Hospital Surgery Clinic in the Treatment of COVID-19 Patients Hospitalised in the Period March - August 2020,2020,"Thorough swabbing is becoming an increasing approach to fight COVID-19 transmission, particularly among asymptomatic subjects, who are thought to represent the majority of potentially-contacting people. Particularly in the current management of COVID-19 emergency, the 3T approach, i.e., testing, tracing and treating, is felt as particularly crucial to fight COVID-19 pandemic. Aside from the time-consuming, cost expensive and the many burdensome issues associated with a thorough swabbing, adopting easy-to-make criteria such as ""drive-thru-swab"" may exacerbate the burden of critical biases and pre-analytical errors, which may impair the analytical reliability of these tests.

We identified the challenges faced by stakeholders as well as the relevant solutions to provide recommendations for sustainable CBME in community hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 31 pages of field and reflection notes were collated through direct observation and used for analysis. Five physicians, eight nurses, one clerk, fourteen medical trainees, and three rural citizens were interviewed between 1 April and 30 September 2020. The interviews were recorded and their contents were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. Three themes emerged: uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, an overwhelming sense of social fear and pressure within and outside communities, and motivation and determination to continue providing CBME. Rural CBME was impacted by not only the fear of infection but also social fear and pressure within and outside communities. Constant assessment of the risks associated with the pandemic and the implications for CMBE is essential to ensure the sustainability of CBME in rural settings, not only for medical educators and students but also stakeholders who administrate rural CBME.","Ohta, Ryuichi; Ryu, Yoshinori; Sano, Chiaki",,,478
441837,AI-based analysis of CT images for rapid triage of COVID-19 patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: There is little published evidence on the gastrointestinal features of COVID-19. AIMS: To report on the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings of patients with COVID-19, and to discuss the possibility of faecal transmission. METHODS: We have reviewed gastrointestinal features of, and faecal test results in, COVID-19 from case reports and retrospective clinical studies relating to the digestive system published since the outbreak. RESULTS: With an incidence of 3% (1/41)-79% (159/201), gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 included anorexia 39.9% (55/138)-50.2% (101/201), diarrhoea 2% (2/99)-49.5% (146/295), vomiting 3.6% (5/138)-66.7% (4/6), nausea 1% (1/99)-29.4% (59/201), abdominal pain 2.2% (3/138)-6.0% (12/201) and gastrointestinal bleeding 4% (2/52)-13.7% (10/73). Diarrhoea was the most common gastrointestinal symptom in children and adults, with a mean duration of 4.1 ± 2.5 days, and was observed before and after diagnosis. Vomiting was more prominent in children. About 3.6% (5/138)-15.9% (32/201) of adult and 6.5% (2/31)-66.7% (4/6) of children patients presented vomiting. Adult and children patients can present with digestive symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms. The incidence of digestive manifestations was higher in the later than in the early stage of the epidemic, but no differences in digestive symptoms among different regions were found. Among the group of patients with a higher proportion of severe cases, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms in severe patients was higher than that in nonsevere patients (anorexia 66.7% vs 30.4%; abdominal pain 8.3% vs 0%); while in the group of patients with a lower severe rate, the proportion with gastrointestinal symptoms was similar in severe and nonsevere cases (nausea and vomiting 6.9% vs 4.6%; diarrhoea 5.8% vs 3.5%). Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and virus nucleocapsid protein were detected in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and infectious virus particles were isolated from faeces. Faecal PCR testing was as accurate as respiratory specimen PCR detection. In 36% (5/14)-53% (39/73) faecal PCR became positive, 2-5 days later than sputum PCR positive. Faecal excretion persisted after sputum excretion in 23% (17/73)-82% (54/66) patients for 1-11 days. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19, and had an increased prevalence in the later stage of the recent epidemic in China. SARS-CoV-2 enters gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and the faeces of COVID-19 patients are potentially infectious.","Tian, Yuan; Rong, Long; Nian, Weidong; He, Yan",Aliment Pharmacol Ther,,478

Objectives: To understand the effectiveness of NPIs reported in the contemporary literatures describing prediction models for prevention of the ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 specifically in Indian population. Methods: Original research articles in English obtained through keyword search in PubMed, WHO Global Database for COVID19, and pre-print servers were included in the review. Thematic synthesis of extracted data from articles were done. Results: Twenty-four articles were found eligible for the review - four published articles and twenty pre-print articles. Compartmental model was found to be the most commonly used mathematical model; along with exponential, time varying, neural network and cluster kinetic models. Social distancing, specifically lockdown, was the most commonly modelled intervention strategy. Additionally, contact tracing using smartphone application, international travel restriction, increasing hospital/ICU beds, changes in testing strategy were also dealt with. Social distancing along with increasing testing seemed to be effective in delaying the peak of the epidemic and reducing the peak prevalence. Conclusion: Although there is mathematical rationality behind implementation of social distancing measures including lockdown, this study also emphasised the importance of other associated measures like increasing tests and increasing the number of hospital and ICU beds. The later components are particularly important during the social mixing period to be observed after lifting of lockdown.","Lahiri, Arista; Jha, Sweety Suman; Bhattacharya, Saikat; Ray, Soumalya; Chakraborty, Arup",Indian J Public Health,,478
442595,The Clinical Course of COVID-19 Disease in a US Hospital System: a Multi-state Analysis,2020,"Proline-glycine-proline (PGP) and its acetylated form (Ac-PGP) are neutrophil chemoattractants generated by collagen degradation, and they have been shown to play a role in chronic inflammatory disease. However, the mechanism for matrikine regulation in acute inflammation has not been well established. Here, we show that these peptides are actively transported from the lung by the oligopeptide transporter, PEPT2. Following intratracheal instillation of Ac-PGP in a mouse model, there was a rapid decline in concentration of the labeled peptide in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) over time and redistribution to extrapulmonary sites. In vitro knockdown of the PEPT2 transporter in airway epithelia or use of a competitive inhibitor of PEPT2, cefadroxil, significantly reduced uptake of Ac-PGP. Animals that received intratracheal Ac-PGP plus cefadroxil had higher levels of Ac-PGP in BAL and lung tissue. Utilizing an acute LPS-induced lung injury model, we demonstrate that PEPT2 blockade enhanced pulmonary Ac-PGP levels and lung inflammation. We further validated this effect using clinical samples from patients with acute lung injury in coculture with airway epithelia. This is the first study to our knowledge to determine the in vitro and in vivo significance of active matrikine transport as a mechanism of modulating acute inflammation and to demonstrate that it may serve as a potential therapeutic target.","Robison, Sarah W; Li, JinDong; Viera, Liliana; Blackburn, Jonathan P; Patel, Rakesh P; Blalock, J Edwin; Gaggar, Amit; Xu, Xin",JCI insight,,478

Following a decline in case numbers during 2013-2016, the number of cases in Afghanistan has increased each year during 2017-2020. This report describes polio eradication activities and progress toward polio eradication in Afghanistan during January 2019-July 2020 and updates previous reports (2,3). Since April 2018, insurgent groups have imposed bans on house-to-house vaccination. In September 2019, vaccination campaigns in areas under insurgency control were restarted only at health facilities. In addition, during March-June 2020, all campaigns were paused because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The number of WPV1 cases reported in Afghanistan increased from 21 in 2018 to 29 in 2019. During January-July 2020, 41 WPV1 cases were reported as of August 29, 2020 (compared with 15 during January-July 2019); in addition, 69 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), and one case of ambiguous vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (aVDPV2) (isolates with no evidence of person-to-person transmission or from persons with no known immunodeficiency) were detected. Dialogue with insurgency leaders through nongovernmental and international organizations is ongoing in an effort to recommence house-to-house campaigns, which are essential to stopping WPV1 transmission in Afghanistan. To increase community demand for polio vaccination, additional community health needs should be addressed, and polio vaccination should be integrated with humanitarian services.","Martinez, Maureen; Akbar, Irfan Elahi; Wadood, Mufti Zubair; Shukla, Hemant; Jorba, Jaume; Ehrhardt, Derek",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,478

443862,Electronic health record derived-impact of COVID-19 on myasthenia gravis,2021,"Simple Summary: This review aims at clarifying the relationships of heavy training with the upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), a topic which has reach the public awareness with the recent outbreaks of Covid 19. The URTIs are quite common in several sport activities among athletes who undergo heavy training. Causes of URTI are still poorly understood, because can be related with innate and genetic susceptibility and with several environmental factors connected with training load and nutrition. The time course of the inflammation process affecting URTI after training, has been also reviewed. After a survey of the possible physiological and psychological causes (stressors), including a survey of the main markers of inflammation currently found in scientific literature (mainly catecholamines), we provided evidence of the ingestion of carbohydrates, C, D, and E vitamins, probiotics and even certain fat, in reducing URTI in athletes. Possible countermeasures to URTI can be a correct nutrition, sleep hygiene, a proper organization of training loads, and the use of technique to reduce stress in professional athletes. There is a lack of studies investigating social factors (isolation) albeit with Covid 19 this gap has been partially fill. The results can be useful also for non-athletes. Immunity is the consequence of a complex interaction between organs and the environment. It is mediated the interaction of several genes, receptors, molecules, hormones, cytokines, antibodies, antigens, and inflammatory mediators which in turn relate and influence the psychological health. The immune system response of heavily trained athletes resembles an even more complex conditions being theorized to follow a J or S shape dynamics at times. High training loads modify the immune response elevating the biological markers of immunity and the body susceptibility to infections. Heavy training and/or training in a cold environment increase the athletes' risk to develop Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTIs). Therefore, athletes, who are considered healthier than the normal population, are in fact more prone to infections of the respiratory tract, due to lowering of the immune system in the time frames subsequent heavy training sessions. In this revision we will review the behavioral intervention, including nutritional approaches, useful to minimize the ""open window"" effect on infection and how to cope with stressors and boost the immune system in athletes.

444024,COVID-19 and SIC (!),2020,"This study investigates the possibility to contain COVID-19 contagion in indoor environments via increasing ventilation rates obtained through high energy efficiency systems combining thermal recovery by heat exchanger and thermodynamic recovery by heat pump. The starting point of this assessment is a procedure to evaluate in naturally ventilated environments, the current infectious risk by using measurements of indoor/outdoor CO2 concentrations to calculate actual air changes per hour. The method was applied to some typical school environments in Italy. The results indicated very infectious situations with reproduction number Ro values up to exceed 13. But, the simulations assessed an extraordinary reduction of indoor viral concentration and consequently of the infection risk by a strong mechanical ventilation. High ventilation rates make facemasks effective even with use levels (from 50%) reasonable also for pupils. This way, R0 goes down the value one. As regards energy performance, the behavior of an autonomous high efficiency air handling unit (HEAHU), to be installed in an existing naturally ventilated classroom, was simulated in the monitored days. The results highlight the ability to achieve a reduction in energy consumption between 60% and 72%.","Schibuola, Luigi; Tambani, Chiara",Energy Build,,478

445900,Distinguishing active pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia from MIS-C,2021,"In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic in France called upon the French Army Health Services (SSA) to support the population on its national territory but also overseas, in Mayotte and French Guiana. In charge of the medical support of the forces, the SSA has evolved since the 18th century according to the format of the Armed Forces but also according to the nature of the conflicts, these changes being accompanied by ethical and moral questions. If rules of medical ethics apply to practitioners, they are also military: in this context, the notions of ethics of responsibility and ethics of conviction bring questions. Its questions are even more complex when these soldiers are projected into external operations where current conflicts, of a terrorist nature, expose the local populations, women and children specifically. Nevertheless, the SSA can also be projected to respond to exclusively health issues (excluding conflicts) as during the Ebola epidemic in Guinea in 2014, or more recently in Mulhouse with COVID-19. This last point raises fears of the development of bioterrorism where the questions of medico-military ethics would then be very complex; they must therefore be taken into account and analyzed, but also extended to raising awareness of the fighting forces.","Boulliat, C; Callu, M F; Massoubre, B",Etique &amp; sante (Imprime),,478

This research study examines the effects of intrinsic factors, namely, perceived utilitarian, hedonic value, materialism, fashion interest and enjoyment, on impulsive online shopping with mediating role of trust and online shopping attitude in the Indian emerging market. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from 443 Indian respondents, using purposive and snowball sampling. The data were analyzed using the IBM Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) and Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) package using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results showed that perceived utilitarian, hedonic value, materialism and enjoyment factors significantly impacted perceived trust and online shopping attitude, but fashion interest had no effect. Mediating factors positively impacted impulsive online shopping and showed a significant association between intrinsic factors and impulsive online shopping. Research limitations/implications: The geographical area of study was limited to only India. Consequently, the findings and conclusions of the study had their limits. The research used the information continuum with a purposive and snowball approach that does not necessarily generalize the findings of the analysis. This work looked at factors stimulating the impulsive online shopping pattern of Indian shoppers in an emerging market. Practical implications: This research would help e-retailers develop new strategies and plans to increase sales volume and create strong relationships with online customers by providing trustworthiness and security in buying practices. Social implications: This study helps to understand the consumer impulsive buying during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and it helps e-retailers to adopt a new online store to draw the attention of the consumers and enhance their online sales. Originality/value: In this COVID-19 situation, this study explores the inherent factors influencing impulsive online shopping in the emerging Indian market. As a result, it contributes to visual identity literature by expanding the field of impulsive online shopping behavior. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Lavuri, R.",International Journal of Emerging Markets,,478

In the context of coordinating multiple stakeholders, the role of the local government can be defined as ‘meta-governance’. It shall provide rules to facilitate collective action and co-produce quality public services. However, the case of Wuhan suggests that some local governments still rely on the traditional administrative system, which hampers them in terms of issuing a sufficient response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Three measures can be taken to facilitate a public governance mechanism in public health emergency management. First, local governments can use the ICTs to create a more transparent information mechanism. The free flow of information could alert all stakeholders to potential emergencies, while the open government data form the base for cross-border collaboration. Second, a more comprehensive Public Health Emergency Preparedness is constructive for local governments in making quality and immediate decisions. This preparedness shall clearly define the responsibility of the involved agencies based on a careful evaluation of their qualification and capability. Third, the local government shall note that good governance requires more than an executive capacity based on command-and-control. It is necessary to develop the ability to work with stakeholders outside the bureaucratic system.","Gao, Xiang; Yu, Jianxing",J. Chinese Gov.,,478
449157,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on liver donation and transplantation: A review of the literature,2021,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused a significant public health challenge worldwide. A lack of effective methods for screening potential patients, rapidly diagnosing suspected cases, and accurately monitoring of the epidemic in real time to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19 raises significant difficulties in mitigating the epidemic in many countries. As effective point-of-care diagnosis tools, simple, low-cost and rapid sensors have the potential to greatly accelerate the screening and diagnosis of suspected patients to improve their treatment and care. In particular, there is evidence that multiple pathogens have been detected in sewage, including SARS-CoV-2, providing significant opportunities for the development of advanced sensors for wastewater-based epidemiology that provide an early warning of the pandemic within the population. Sensors could be used to screen potential carriers, provide real-time monitoring and control of the epidemic, and even support targeted drug screening and delivery within the integration of emerging mobile health (mHealth) technology. In this communication, we discuss the feasibility of an integrated point-of-care biosensor system with mobile health for wastewater-based epidemiology (iBMW) for early warning of COVID-19, screening and diagnosis of potential infectors, and improving health care and public health. The iBMW will provide an effective approach to prevent, evaluate and intervene in a fast, affordable and reliable way, thus enabling real-time guidance for the government in providing effective intervention and evaluating the effectiveness of intervention.","Mao, Kang; Zhang, Hua; Yang, Zhugen",Biosens Bioelectron,,478

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 126 crowns with four identical buccal surfaces were fabricated using seven different CAD/CAM materials: CEREC Blocs unglazed (CBU), CEREC Blocs glazed (CBG), IPS Empress CAD (EMP), IPS e.max CAD (EMA), VITA SUPRINITY PC (SUP), inCoris TZI (TZI) and VITA ENAMIC (ENA). A total of 504 APC Flash-Free (APC FF)-precoated brackets were bonded applying three surface treatments: (1) MI; (2) MEP and (3) 9.6% HF. SBS was performed after 24 h and TC. Results were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests (p < 0.05). RESULTS: MEP conditioning yielded lower SBS results compared with MI and 9.6% HF for CBG (24 h and TC) and EMA (TC) materials. EMP conditioning with MEP after 24 h obtained lower SBS values compared with MI; however, after TC, SBS was similar to MI group and higher than with 9.6% HF. After TC for TZI ceramic, MI protocol (sandblasting) obtained higher SBS scores than MEP, but similar than 9.6% HF. Treatment of ENA with MI and MEP produced higher results than 9.6% HF after TC. SBS results were similar for CBU and SUP, regardless of the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although each CAD/CAM material requires specific surface treatment to obtain the highest SBS of APC FF brackets, the treatment with MEP is a valid orthodontic alternative for most of the materials tested. TC significantly decreased SBS for most of the materials. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: MEP can be considered a valid and promising product to condition most of the CAD/CAM ceramics evaluated for APC FF bracket bonding purposes, allowing a faster and safer procedure.","González-Serrano, Carlos; Phark, Jin-Ho; Fuentes, María Victoria; Albaladejo, Alberto; Sánchez-Monescillo, Andrés; Duarte, Sillas; Ceballos, Laura",,,478

DESIGN: Comparative cost analysis METHODS: Two different treatment models were evaluated. The first model included patients undergoing routine VA assessment, DFEs, OCT imaging, and intravitreal injections. The second model eliminated the routine VA assessment and DFE, while utilizing OCT imaging through an undilated pupil followed by the intravitreal injection. The two models incorporated both bevacizumab and aflibercept. The number of patients per clinic day, the cost per visit, and the daily revenues were compared between the two models. RESULTS: Optimized schedules with and without VA assessments and DFEs allowed for 48 and 96 patients to be injected per day, respectively. Excluding drug costs, the cost per encounter for the visits with and without a DFE were $39.33 and $22.63, respectively. Including the drug costs, the costs per encounter for the visits with and without a DFE were $85.55 and $68.85 for bevacizumab and $1,787.58 and $1,7770.88 for aflibercept, respectively. Once the reimbursements for each visit type were included, the clinics that eliminated the VA and DFEs were more cost efficient. CONCLUSIONS: Eliminating both VA assessments and DFEs for patients undergoing OCT-guided retreatment with intravitreal injections resulted in decreased exposure times between patients and clinic staff, decreased cost per encounter, and increased patient volumes per clinic day, resulting in improved clinic efficiency and safety while seeing more patients in a clinic day.","Trivizki, Omer; Karp, Michael R; Chawla, Anuj; Yamanuha, Justin; Gregori, Giovanni; Rosenfeld, Philip J",Am. j. ophthalmol,,478

STUDY DESIGN: An anonymous online survey was disseminated to members of RAS and YFA. Descriptive analyses were performed and factors associated with depression and burnout were examined with univariate and multivariable stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the RAS/YFA membership of 21,385, there were 1,160 respondents. The majority of respondents (96%) reported the COVID-19 pandemic having a negative impact on their clinical experience, with 84% of residents reporting a > 50% reduction in operative volume and inability to meet minimum case requirements. Respondents also reported negative impacts on personal wellness. Nearly one-third reported inadequate access to personal protective equipment, and depression and burnout were pervasive (&#8805;21% of respondents reported yes to every screening symptom). On multivariable analysis, female sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.54 for depression, OR 1.47 for burnout) and lack of wellness resources (OR 1.55 for depression, OR 1.44 for burnout) predicted depression and burnout. Access to adequate personal protective equipment was protective against burnout (OR 0.52). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lives of residents and early-career surgeons. Actionable items from these data include mitigation of burnout and depression through increasing personal protective equipment access and provision of wellness programs, with a particular focus on high-risk groups.","Coleman, Julia R; Abdelsattar, Jad M; Glocker, Roan J",J.

454473,Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic: a Campus ALL study,2020,"Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) that offer protection from particulates are deployed in different workplace environments. Usage of PAPRs by healthcare workers is rapidly increasing; these respirators are often considered the best option in healthcare settings, particularly during public health emergency situations, such as outbreaks of pandemic diseases. At the same time, lack of user training and certain vigorous work activities may lead to a decrease in a respirator's performance. There is a critical need for real-time performance monitoring of respiratory protective devices, including PAPRs. In this effort, a new robust and low-cost real-time performance monitor (RePM) capable of evaluating the protection offered by a PAPR against aerosol particles at a workplace was developed. The new device was evaluated on a manikin and on human subjects against a pair of condensation nuclei counters (P-Trak) used as the reference protection measurement system. The outcome was expressed as a manikin-based protection factor (mPF) and a Simulated Workplace Protection Factor (SWPF) determined while testing on subjects. For the manikin-based testing, the data points collected by the two methods were plotted against each other; a near-perfect correlation was observed with a correlation coefficient of 0.997. This high correlation is particularly remarkable since RePM and condensation particle counter (CPC) measure in different particle size ranges. The data variability increased with increasing mPF. The evaluation on human subjects demonstrated that RePM prototype provided an excellent Sensitivity (96.3% measured on human subjects at a response time of 60 sec) and a Specificity of 100%. The device is believed to be the first of its kind to quantitatively monitor PAPR performance while the wearer is working; it is small, lightweight, and does not interfere with job functions.","Grinshpun, Sergey A; Corey, Jonathan; Yermakov, Michael; Wu, Bingbing; Strickland, Kevin T; Bergman, Michael; Zhuang, Ziqing",J Occup Environ Hyg,,478
454580,Telemedicine in the Evaluation and Management of Neurosurgical Spine Patients,2020,"The current COVID-19 pandemic threatens human life, health, and productivity. AI plays an essential role in COVID-19 case classification as we can apply machine learning models on COVID-19 case data to predict infectious cases and recovery rates using chest x-ray. Accessing patient's private data violates patient privacy and traditional machine learning model requires accessing or transferring whole data to train the model. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in federated machine learning, as it provides an effective solution for data privacy, centralized computation, and high computation power. In this paper, we studied the efficacy of federated learning versus traditional learning by developing two machine learning models (a federated learning model and a traditional machine learning model)using Keras and TensorFlow federated, we used a descriptive dataset and chest x-ray (CXR) images from COVID-19 patients. During the model training stage, we tried to identify which factors affect model prediction accuracy and loss like activation function, model optimizer, learning rate, number of rounds, and data Size, we kept recording and plotting the model loss and prediction accuracy per each training round, to identify which factors affect the model performance, and we found that softmax activation function and SGD optimizer give better prediction accuracy and loss, changing the number of rounds and learning rate has slightly effect on model prediction accuracy and prediction loss but increasing the data size did not have any effect on model prediction accuracy and prediction loss. finally, we build a comparison between the proposed models' loss, accuracy, and performance speed, the results demonstrate that the federated machine learning model has a better prediction accuracy and loss but higher performance time than the traditional machine learning model.","Abdul Salam, Mustafa; Taha, Sanaa; Ramadan, Mohamed",PLoS One,,478

454873,The Centrality of Obesity in the Course of Severe COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, public health interventions have been introduced globally in order to prevent the spread of the virus and avoid the overload of health care systems, especially for the most severely affected patients. Scientific studies to date have focused primarily on describing the clinical course of patients, identifying treatment options and developing vaccines. In Germany, as in many other regions, current tests for SARS-CoV2 are not conducted on a representative basis and in a longitudinal design. Furthermore, knowledge about the immune status of the population is lacking. Nonetheless, these data are needed to understand the dynamics of the pandemic and hence to appropriately design and evaluate interventions. For this purpose, we recently started a prospective population-based cohort in Munich, Germany, with the aim to develop a better understanding of the state and dynamics of the pandemic. METHODS: In 100 out of 755 randomly selected constituencies, 3000 Munich households are identified via random route and offered enrollment into the study. All household members are asked to complete a baseline questionnaire and subjects &#8805;14 years of age are asked to provide a venous blood sample of &#8804;3 ml for the determination of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgA status. The residual plasma and the blood pellet are preserved for later genetic and molecular biological investigations. For twelve months, each household member is asked to keep a diary of daily symptoms, whereabouts and contacts via WebApp. If symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 are reported, family members, including children < 14 years, are offered a pharyngeal swab taken at the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, for molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2. In case of severe symptoms, participants will be transferred to a Munich hospital. For one year, the study teams re-visits the households for blood sampling every six weeks. DISCUSSION: With the planned study we will establish a reliable epidemiological tool to improve the understanding of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to better assess the effectiveness of public health measures as well as their socio-economic effects. This will support policy makers in managing the epidemic based on scientific evidence.","Radon, Katja; Saathoff, Elmar; Pritsch, Michael; Guggenbühl Noller, Jessica Michelle; Kroidl, Inge; Olbrich, Laura; Thiel, Verena; Diefenbach, Max; Riess, Friedrich; Forster, Felix; Theis, Fabian; Wieser, Andreas; Hoelscher, Michael",BMC Public Health,,478

455808,Two cases of COVID-19 presenting with a clinical picture resembling chilblains: first report from the Middle East,2020,"WATERLIT Abstract: Management of patients with severe or critical COVID-19 is mainly modeled after care for patients with severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from other causes, and these recommendations are based on evidence that often originates from investigations in resource-rich intensive care units located in high-income countries. Often, it is impractical to apply these recommendations to resource-restricted settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We report on a set of pragmatic recommendations for acute respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation management in patients with severe/critical COVID-19 in LMICs. We suggest starting supplementary oxygen when SpO2 is persistently lower than 94%. We recommend supplemental oxygen to keep SpO2at 88–95% and suggest higher targets in settings where continuous pulse oximetry is not available but intermittent pulse oximetry is. We suggest a trial of awake prone positioning in patients who remain hypoxemic;however, this requires close monitoring, and clear failure and escalation criteria. In places with an adequate number and trained staff, the strategy seems safe. We recommend to intubate based on signs of respiratory distress more than on refractory hypoxemia alone, and we recommend close monitoring for respiratory worsening and early intubation if worsening occurs. We recommend low–tidal volume ventilation combined with FiO2 and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) management based on a high FiO2/low PEEP table. We recommend against using routine recruitment maneuvers, unless as a rescue therapy in refractory hypoxemia, and we recommend using prone positioning for 12–16 hours in case of refractory hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 150 mmHg, FiO2 ≥ 0.6 and PEEP ≥ 10 cmH2O) in intubated patients as standard in ARDS patients. We also recommend against sharing one ventilator for multiple patients. We recommend daily assessments for readiness for weaning by a low-level pressure support and recommend against using a T-piece trial because of aerosolization risk","Papali, A.; Sivakorn, C.; Hashmi, M.; Neto, A.

METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive study conducted on Canterbury District Health Board trauma registry data. The study population consisted of all major trauma patients of all age groups admitted to Christchurch Hospital over three 33-day periods: before, during and after COVID-19 lockdown in New Zealand. Broadly speaking, major trauma is defined as having an injury severity score 13 or death following injury. RESULTS: There was a 42% reduction in the volume of major trauma admissions during lockdown. Falls were the most common injury during lockdown, and transport-related injuries after lockdown. Alcohol intoxication was associated with 19 to 33% of all injuries across the study periods. CONCLUSION: Major trauma inevitably occurred during lockdown, although at considerably lower volumes. After lockdown, once restrictions were eased, major trauma admissions reverted to pre-lockdown patterns. Injury prevention strategies can reduce avoidable pressures on hospitals at a time of pandemic. In New Zealand, focus should be placed on reducing alcohol- and transport-related injuries and increasing community awareness on falls prevention.","Fan, D.; Scowcroft, H.; McCombie, A.; Duncan, R.; Wakeman, C.",The New Zealand medical journal,,478

It is established that at the present stage, relatively new infections require some attention, which can lead to infection of medical workers in the course of their professional activities. These infections include atypical pneumonia (TOPC or SARS-severe acute respiratory syndrome), middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (BRVS-Cov), African hemorrhagic fevers (Marburg, Ebola, Lassa), Crimea-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCGL), and others. All these infections are quite severe, with a large number of deaths. Special attention is paid to the polyethyleneological nature of HAIs, which determines the need for a multi-modal approach to organizing preventive measures to protect medical workers from infection.","Goloverova, Yuliya A.; Marin, German G.; Golubcova, Alla A.; Shabalina, Svetlana V.; Romanova, Ksenia G.",Infektsionnye Bolezni,,478

The conclusion is that the pandemic has increased the many vulnerabilities to which institutionalized older people were already exposed, adding vulnerability to a new disease, such as COVID-19, due to its high lethality and comorbidity, aggravated by precariousness of long-term Brazilian institutions due to the negligence of public authorities, civil society, the management of the institution and the families of the patients.

457033,Cardiopulmonary resuscitation after hospital admission with covid-19,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite the increase in the number of novel antiseizure medications over the past 20 years, approximately one-third of patients will not have adequate seizure control on medications. For these patients, additional options need to be considered, including dietary, device, and surgical treatments. In addition, many complementary therapies can be considered as adjunctive treatment, with the intent of improving quality of life for persons with epilepsy and potentially allowing for improvement in seizure control. RECENT FINDINGS: This review outlines established and developing treatments for drug-resistant epilepsy. Surgical treatments, including resective surgery and vagus nerve stimulation, have been routine care for several decades. In the last several years, new neurostimulation options have been approved (responsive neurostimulation and deep brain stimulation) or are under development (continuous subthreshold cortical stimulation). For patients with lesion or well-defined seizure-onset zones, less invasive options including laser ablation and ultrasound therapy provide the potential for faster recovery times and less morbidity. Not all therapies are in the pharmacological or surgical arenas. This review also explores the evidence for complementary treatments, including relaxation and meditation techniques, and art and music therapy. Despite the range of antiseizure medications available, they still provide inadequate for a large number of patients with epilepsy, either due to ongoing seizures or intolerable side effects. Complementary therapies, including diet, meditation techniques, and music therapy, provide compelling treatment options to improve quality of life while potentially improving seizure control. In appropriate patients, stimulation devices or surgical resection can offer options for significant seizure reduction or even cure. The full range of therapeutics should be considered for each patient with epilepsy when they are struggling with inadequate seizure control or side effects with traditional pharmacological treatment.","Dawit, Sara; Crepeau, Amy Z",Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep,,478

The survey was disseminated in 11 countries: UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, India, Latvia, Poland, Romania, and Sweden. We acquired 9543 unique responses. Our findings show significant differences across countries in perceived effectiveness, restrictiveness, and compliance. Governments that suffer low levels of trust should put more effort into persuading citizens, especially men, in the effectiveness of the proposed measures. They should provide financial compensation to citizens who have lost their job or income due to the containment measures to improve measure compliance.

We discover that the reduction of connections between two populations can delay the death curve but cannot well reduce the final mortality. We propose a merged SIR model, which advises elderly individuals to interact less with their non-elderly connections at the initial stage but interact more with their non-elderly relationships later, to reduce the final mortality.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate perineogenital pain intensity and quality as well as short-term complications after BMGU, and to describe the impact of pain and complications on stricture recurrence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial including 135 patients, who underwent BMGU from 2014 to 2015, was performed. INTERVENTION: One-stage BMGU. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Patient-reported perineogenital pain was assessed by the Numeric Pain Rating Scale and the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire preoperatively and at 1, 5, and 21 d, and 3, 6, and 12 mo postoperatively. Complications were assessed by the Clavien-Dindo classification and the Comprehensive Complication Index. Pain and complications were compared according to stricture recurrence. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At a mean follow-up of 21±15 mo, 29 patients (21%) had stricture recurrence. Pain intensity as well as sensory and affective pain quality decreased over time, reaching a minimum at 6 mo. Postoperative complications at days 5 (95% of patients) and 21 (27% of patients) were predominantly ""minor"" (Clavien-Dindo classification grade&#8804;IIIa). Neither patient-reported perineogenital pain nor cumulative morbidity burden was different between patients with and those without stricture recurrence (all p &#8805; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Perineogenital pain is frequent after BMGU, but pain intensity and quality decrease over time. The same holds true for postoperative complications, which are frequent but mostly present as minor events. Current findings allow for thorough preoperative patient counseling regarding the expected perineogenital pain intensity and quality over time as well as complications following BMGU.

In countries like Brazil with colonial histories and traditions, the social markers of differences are heavily anchored in social and racial demarcation, and the political and social dynamics and processes based on structural racism act on this demarcation. The pandemic's actual profile in Brazil clashes with narratives according to which COVID-19 is a democratic pandemic, an argument aligned with the rhetoric of racial democracy that represents a powerful strategy aimed at maintaining the subaltern place of racialized populations such as indigenous peoples and blacks, as a product of modern coloniality. This essay focuses on the pandemic's profile in the Brazilian black population, in dialogue with decolonial contributions and critical readings of racism. The authors discuss government responses and COVID-19 indicators according to race/color, demonstrating the maintenance of historical storylines that continue to threaten black lives.

459544,Brain and nerves affected before the lungs in COVID‐19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Although some prognostic factors for COVID-19 were consistently identified across the studies, differences were found for other factors that could be due to the characteristics of the study populations and the variables incorporated into the statistical model. We aimed to a priori identify specific patient profiles and then assess their association with the outcomes in COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms admitted specifically to hospital wards. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-center study from February 2020 to April 2020. A non-supervised cluster analysis was first used to detect patient profiles based on characteristics at admission of 220 consecutive patients admitted to our institution. Then, we assessed the prognostic value using Cox regression analyses to predict survival. RESULTS: Three clusters were identified, with 47 patients in cluster 1, 87 in cluster 2, and 86 in cluster 3; the presentation of the patients differed among the clusters. Cluster 1 mostly included sexagenarian patients with active malignancies who were admitted early after the onset of COVID-19. Cluster 2 included the oldest patients, who were generally overweight and had hypertension and renal insufficiency, while cluster 3 included the youngest patients, who had gastrointestinal symptoms and delayed admission. Sixty-day survival rates were 74.3%, 50.6% and 96.5% in clusters 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This was confirmed by the multivariable Cox analyses that showed the prognostic value of these patterns. CONCLUSION: The cluster approach seems appropriate and pragmatic for the early identification of patient profiles that could help physicians segregate patients according to their prognosis.","Bondeelle, Louise; Chevret, Sylvie; Cassonnet, Stéphane; Harel, Stéphanie; Denis, Blandine; de Castro, Nathalie; Bergeron, Anne",PLoS One,,478
459625,Perspectives of Neuro-COVID: Myasthenia,2021,"Countries around the world are implementing lock-down measures in a bid to flatten the curve of the new deadly COVID-19 disease. Our paper does not claim to have found the cure for COVID-19, neither does it claim that the suggested model have taken into account all the complexities around the spread of the disease. Nonetheless, the fundamental question asked in this paper is to know if within the conditions taken into account in this suggested model, the integral lock-down is effective in saving human lives. To answer this question, a mathematical model was suggested taking into account the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 from dead bodies to humans and the effect of lock-down. Three cases were considered. The first case suggested that there is transmission from dead to the living (medical staffs as they perform postmortem procedures on corpses, and direct contacts with during burial ceremonies). This case has no equilibrium points except for disease free equilibrium, a clear indication that care must be taken when dealing with corpses due to corona-19. In the second case we removed the transmission rate from dead bodies. This case showed an equilibrium point, although the number of deaths, carriers and infected grew exponentially up to a certain stability level. In the last case, we incorporated a lock-down and social distancing effect, using the next generation matrix. We could achieve a zero reproduction number, with number of deaths, infected and carriers decaying very rapidly. This is a clear indication that if lock-down recommendations are observed the threat of COVID-19 can be reduced to zero in few months.While our mathematical model agrees with the effectiveness of the lock-down, it is important to mention damaging effects of inadequate testing. The long waiting period of few days before confirmation of status, can only lead to more infections. The asymptomatic tested person could be positive and spread the infection, or could contact the virus in days after testing and will spread the disease further, after being given a false result. Testing kit that with immediate results are needed for more efficient measures. We used Italy's Data to guide the construction of the mathematical model. To include non-locality into mathematical formulas, differential and integral operators were suggested. Properties and numerical approximations were presented in details. Finally, the suggested differential and integral operators were applied to the model.","Atangana, Abdon",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,478
459638,Estimates of the initial impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on overall mortality: Evidence from Italy,2020,"While numerous treatments for ASD are available, intervention based on the principles and procedures of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) has garnered substantial scientific support In this study we evaluated the effects of the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, followed by quarantine provisions and during the three months after the resumption of activities The study was conducted on a group of children taking part on a ABA-based intervention funded by the Local Health Authority (ASL) of the province of Caserta In this study we considered a sample of 88 children who had been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, aged between 18 and 30 months The following inclusion criteria were observed: age at the time of diagnosis less than 30 months, absence of other neurological, genetic, or sensorineural pathologies, and severity level 1 measured by symptoms evaluation based on the ADOS 2 module T (used for diagnosis) During the lockdown children experienced improvements in communication, socialization, and personal autonomy During the three months after the ABA treatment, the acquired skills were maintained but no significant improvement was demonstrated In this study, we describe how parent training was significant in avoiding delays in the generalization of socially significant behaviors, following the drastic interruption of the treatment in this group of children","Sergi, Luana Mingione Emanuele Ricci Maria Carla Cavallaro Antonella Russo Ferdinando Corrivetti Giulio Operto Francesca Felicia Frolli Alessandro",Pediatric Reports,,478
459943,Pulse Steroid Treatment for Hospitalized Adults with COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine modalities, such as videoconferencing, are used by health care providers to remotely deliver health care to patients. Telemedicine use in pediatrics has increased in recent years. This has resulted in improved health care access, optimized disease management, progress in the monitoring of health conditions, and fewer exposures to patients with illnesses during pandemics (eg, the COVID-19 pandemic). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to systematically evaluate the most recent evidence on the feasibility and accessibility of telemedicine services, patients' and care providers' satisfaction with these services, and treatment outcomes related to telemedicine service use among pediatric populations with different health conditions. METHODS: Studies were obtained from the PubMed database on May 10, 2020. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. In this review, we included randomized controlled trials from the last 10 years that used a telemedicine approach as a study intervention or assessed telemedicine as a subspecialty of pediatric care. Titles and abstracts were independently screened based on the eligibility criteria. Afterward, full texts were retrieved and independently screened based on the eligibility criteria. A standardized form was used to extract the following data: publication title, first author's name, publication year, participants' characteristics, study design, the technology-based approach that was used, intervention characteristics, study goals, and study findings. RESULTS: In total, 11 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. All studies were categorized as randomized controlled trials (8/11, 73%) or cluster randomized trials (3/11, 27%). The number of participants in each study ranged from 22 to 400. The health conditions that were assessed included obesity (3/11, 27%), asthma (2/11, 18%), mental health conditions (1/11, 9%), otitis media (1/11, 9%), skin conditions (1/11, 9%), type 1 diabetes (1/11, 9%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (1/11, 9%), and cystic fibrosis-related pancreatic insufficiency (1/11). The telemedicine approaches that were used included patient and doctor videoconferencing visits (5/11, 45%), smartphone-based interventions (3/11, 27%), telephone counseling (2/11, 18%), and telemedicine-based screening visits (1/11, 9%). The telemedicine interventions in all included studies resulted in outcomes that were comparable to or better than the outcomes of control groups. These outcomes were related to symptom management, quality of life, satisfaction, medication adherence, visit completion rates, and disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Although more research is needed, the evidence from this review suggests that telemedicine services for the general public and pediatric care are comparable to or better than in-person services. Patients, health care professionals, and caregivers may benefit from using both telemedicine services and traditional, in-person health care services. To maximize the potential of telemedicine, future research should focus on improving patients' access to care, increasing the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine services, and eliminating barriers to telemedicine use.","Shah, Aashaka C; Badawy, Sherif M",JMIR Pediatr Parent,,478

460136,Managing patients with hematological malignancies during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"We present results of three wide-band directed searches for continuous gravitational waves from 15 young supernova remnants in the first half of the third Advanced LIGO and Virgo observing run. We use three search pipelines with distinct signal models and methods of identifying noise artifacts. Without ephemerides of these sources, the searches are conducted over a frequency band spanning from 10~Hz to 2~kHz. We find no evidence of continuous gravitational radiation from these sources. We set upper limits on the intrinsic signal strain at 95\% confidence level in sample sub-bands, estimate the sensitivity in the full band, and derive the corresponding constraints on the fiducial neutron star ellipticity and $r$-mode amplitude. The best 95\% confidence constraints placed on the signal strain are $7.7\times 10^{-26}$ and $7.8\times 10^{-26}$ near 200~Hz for the supernova remnants G39.2--0.3 and G65.7+1.2, respectively. The most stringent constraints on the ellipticity and $r$-mode amplitude reach $\lesssim 10^{-7}$ and $ \lesssim 10^{-5}$, respectively, at frequencies above $\sim 400$~Hz for the closest supernova remnant G266.2--1.2/Vela Jr.","Collaboration, The LIGO Scientific; Collaboration, the Virgo; Abbott, the KAGRA Collaboration R.; Abbott, T.

461034,"Response to the letter to the editor: ""The link between Vitamin D and COVID-19""",2021,"Primary and specialty care clinicians strive to base diagnoses and treatment on specific, measurable abnormalities. Yet those with invisible, controversial illnesses such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) often have symptoms not explained by standard laboratory values. For instance, one of the cardinal features of ME/CFS is postexertional malaise, the exacerbation of symptoms-fatigue, pain, cognitive dysfunction-following exertion, which contradicts studies showing the health benefits of exercise. In these cases, overly physicalist approaches to caring for patients are not likely to be helpful, and a clinician's willingness to listen to a patient's experience of illness becomes essential.","Wall, Dorothy",AMA J Ethics,,478
461186,"Initial viral load of a COVID-19-infected case indicated by its cycle threshold value of polymerase chain reaction could be used as a predictor of its transmissibility-An experience from Gujarat, India",2020,"SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) is the viral agent responsible for the pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Vaccines are being deployed all over the world with good efficacy, but there is no approved antiviral treatment to date. This is particularly needed since the emergence of variants and the potential immune escape may prolong pandemic spreading of the infection for much longer than anticipated. Here, we developed a series of small molecules and identified RG10 as a potent antiviral compound against SARS-CoV-2 in cell lines and human airway epithelia (HAE). RG10 localizes to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, perturbing ER morphology and inducing ER stress. Yet, RG10 does not associate with SARS-CoV-2 replication sites although preventing virus replication. To further investigate the antiviral properties of our compound, we developed fluorescent SARS-CoV-2 viral particles allowing us to track virus arrival to ER membranes. Live cell imaging of replication-competent virus infection revealed that RG10 stalls the intracellular virus-ER dynamics. Finally, we synthesized RG10b, a stable version of RG10, that showed increased potency in vitro and in HAE with a pharmacokinetic half-life greater than 2 h. Together, our work reports on a novel fluorescent virus model and innovative antiviral strategy consisting of the perturbation of ER/virus dynamics, highlighting the promising antiviral properties of RG10 and RG10b.","Bakhache, William; Partiot, Emma; Lucansky, Vincent; Bare, Yonis; Bonaventure, Boris; Goujon, Caroline; Bories, Cedric; Deffieu, Maika S; Gaudin, Raphael",,,478

This study aims to examine gender differences on a set of psychosocial factors shown to influence preventive behaviors against infectious diseases such as COVID-19. We conducted a web survey (N = 1.004) a few weeks after the end of the peak of the first wave of infections in Chile. The survey assessed participants’ perception of risk and worry about the COVID-19 pandemic, confidence in the government’s competence and integrity in dealing with the crisis, attribution of responsibility to various stakeholders, and adoption of preventive behaviors such as hygiene, distancing, and information-seeking. Our results confirm significant gender-based differences for both the psychosocial factors and the adoption of preventive behaviors. We conclude that women show a higher level of worry and fear of the pandemic and are keener to adopt preventive hygiene and social distancing behaviors. Similarly, participants report a low level of trust in government authorities, with women reporting the lowest trust level. The implications of these findings for the design of future risk communication strategies are discussed.","Bronfman, Nicolás Repetto Paula Cordón Paola Castañeda Javiera Cisternas Pamela",Sustainability,,478
461488,Venous thromboembolism in COVID-19: Are women different?,2020,"Chemical bonding in main-group IV chalcogenides is an intensely discussed topic, easily understandable because of their remarkable physical properties that predestine these solid-state materials for their widespread use in, for instance, thermoelectrics and phase-change memory applications. The atomistic origin of their unusual property portfolio remains somewhat unclear, however, even though different and sometimes conflicting chemical-bonding concepts have been introduced in the recent years. Here, it is proposed that projecting phononic force-constant tensors for pairs of atoms along differing directions and ranges provide a suitable and quantitative descriptor of the bonding nature for these materials. In combination with orbital-based quantitative measures of covalency such as crystal orbital Hamilton populations (COHP), it is concluded that the well-established many-center and even n-center bonding is an appropriate picture of the underlying quantum-chemical bonding mechanism, supporting the recent proposal of hyperbonded phase-change materials.","Hempelmann, Jan; Müller, Peter C; Konze, Philipp M; Stoffel, Ralf P; Steinberg, Simon; Dronskowski, Richard",Adv Mater,,478

There is still an open debate about the real effect of school closure on the reduction of risk of infection on children and the risk of infection on with other age groups (parents, grandparents and others). There is an agreement on the effect of school closure in reducing and delaying the peak of the outbreak. In this Editorial, starting from the ongoing Italian experience, we discuss direct and indirect effects of school closure on children’s psychological health and learning. We also highlight the need for an “on peace time” planning of measures and strategies necessary to face the direct and indirect effect of this outbreak and other outbreaks, on children’s psychological health.","Petretto, Donatella Rita; Masala, Ilaria; Masala, Carmelo",Clin.

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey from April 21 to 30, 2020. We queried sites regarding NICU demographics, NICU restrictions on parental presence, and changes in ancillary staff availability. RESULTS: Globally, 277 facilities responded to the survey. NICU policies preserving 24/7 parental presence decreased (83-53%, p < 0.001) and of preserving full parental participation in rounds fell (71-32%, p < 0.001). Single-family room design NICUs best preserved 24/7 parental presence after the emergence of COVID-19 (single-family room 65%, hybrid-design 57%, open bay design 45%, p = 0.018). In all, 120 (43%) NICUs reported reductions in therapy services, lactation medicine, and/or social work support. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital restrictions have significantly limited parental presence for NICU admitted infants, although single-family room design may attenuate this effect.","Darcy Mahoney, Ashley; White, Robert D; Velasquez, Annalyn; Barrett, Tyson S; Clark, Reese H; Ahmad, Kaashif A",J Perinatol,,478

Due to the limited testing capacity available in France at the time, we elaborated a testing strategy according to pre-test probability. METHODS: The investigation design combined active case finding and contact tracing around each confirmed case with testing of at-risk contact persons who had any evocative symptoms (n = 88). One month later, we performed serology testing to test and screen symptomatic and asymptomatic cases again (n = 79). RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were confirmed (14 with RT-PCR and 10 with serology). The attack rate was 29% (24/83). Median age was 40 (24 to 59), and the sex ratio was 15/12. Only three cases were asymptomatic (= no symptoms at all, 13%, 95% CI, 3-32). Nineteen symptomatic cases (79%, 95% CI, 63-95) presented a respiratory infection, two of which were severe. All the RT-PCR confirmed cases acquired protective antibodies. Median incubation was 4 days (from 1 to 13 days), and the median serial interval was 3 days (0 to 15). We identified pre-symptomatic transmission in 40% of this cluster, but no transmission from asymptomatic to symptomatic cases. CONCLUSION: We report the effective use of targeted testing according to pre-test probability, specifically prioritizing symptomatic COVID-19 diagnosis and contact tracing. The asymptomatic rate raises questions about the real role of asymptomatic infected people in transmission. Conversely, pre-symptomatic contamination occurred frequently in this cluster, highlighting the need to identify, test, and quarantine asymptomatic at-risk contact persons (= contact tracing). The local lockdown imposed helped reduce transmission during the investigation period.","de Laval, Franck; Grosset-Janin, Anaïs; Delon, François; Allonneau, Alexandre; Tong, Christelle; Letois, Flavie; Couderc, Anne; Sanchez, Marc-Antoine; Destanque, César; Biot, Fabrice; Raynaud, Françoise; Bigaillon, Christine; Ferraris, Olivier; Simon-Loriere, Etienne; Enouf, Vincent; Andriamanantena, Dinaherisoa; de Santi, Vincent Pommier; Javelle, Emilie; Mérens, Audrey",BMC Infect Dis,,478

465274,Gendered Disease Iconography through the Lens of COVID-19 in Hong Kong,2021,"BACKGROUND: Past survey studies document that people strongly prefer Covid-19 vaccines developed domestically over those developed abroad. Available evidence suggests that this preference for domestic vaccines over foreign ones may stem from prejudice against foreign countries, but identifying prejudice-based vaccine preferences is difficult because people also draw inferences about the quality of vaccines based on country of origin. We exploit a unique opportunity provided by the announcement of a viable vaccine by a bi-national venture, BioNTech and Pfizer, to examine the effect of such prejudice on vaccination intentions while controlling for beliefs about the vaccine quality. METHODS: We implemented a survey experiment in Germany and the United States (n = 582, 661 respectively) a few days after the BioNTech/Pfizer announcement of a viable vaccine. We randomized the identified company (and country) responsible for the vaccine development between BioNTech (Germany) and Pfizer (U.S.) and asked respondents when they would take said vaccine. RESULTS: In either the German and U.S. samples, we find little evidence that a country of origin of the vaccine makes a difference in when respondents intend to get vaccinated. We also see no evidence that those with a general animus toward the other foreign country would be more biased against a foreign vaccine. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that prejudice against foreign countries may be less of a concern for vaccine hesitancy and that its effect may be highly context specific.","Kobayashi, Yoshiharu; Howell, Christopher; Heinrich, Tobias",Soc Sci Med,,478

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive single-stranded RNA virus, encased in a lipid bilayer derived from the host cell membrane and consists of four structural proteins (S, M, E and N), plus a haemagglutinin-sterase. The binding of the S protein to the ECA2 receptor allows the entry of the virus into the host cell and is a potential therapeutic target. 81% of patients develop mild symptoms, 14% have severe symptoms and 5% require intensive care management. Fever is the most frequent symptom, followed by cough and dyspnea. Most patients do not present leukocytosis, but they do present lymphopenia with sputum cultures that do not show other pathogens. In lung biopsies of severe patients, the most noticeable finding is diffuse alveolar damage. Radiologically, ground glass and alveolar patterns are observed; the lesions being predominantly basal, subpleural, and posterior, with a multifocal peripheral distribution, more affecting the right lower lobe. There is a marked inflammatory response, up to the cytokine storm, in which anti-inflammatory treatment with pulse therapy with methylprednisolone would be indicated. Although there are no large-scale studies regarding the use of chloroquine / hydroxychloroquine, due to the global situation, its use has been authorized for its anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-inflammatory effect, which can be potentiated with the use of azithromycin.","Accinelli, Roberto Alfonso; Zhang Xu, Cristian Mingxiong; Ju Wang, Jia-Der; Yachachin-Chávez, José Miguel; Cáceres-Pizarro, Jaime Augusto; Tafur-Bances, Karla Beatriz; Flores-Tejada, Roberto Gabriel; Paiva-Andrade, Alejandra Del Carmen",Rev Peru Med Exp Salud Publica,,478

Reallocation of resources for managing the outbreak might have caused a disruption in stroke care. This study analyses the impact on stroke care of reorganising the healthcare system in response to the first COVID-19 outbreak peak in Spain and the strategies adopted by Spanish stroke units to deal with this impact. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained data from a structured survey sent to the responsible of stroke units across the country. We recorded the number of strokes, stroke code activations, intravenous thrombolysis treatments and mechanical thrombectomies during February and March 2019 and 2020. We also collected information on the impact on workflow metrics and on the availability of specialised neurological care and rehabilitation treatments, the characteristics of stroke care for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact on human resources. We compared the activity data between 2019 and 2020 and the information on activity and impact on stroke care between regions classified according to the disease incidence rate. RESULTS: Fifty-seven (75%) of all stroke units in Spain responded to the survey. There was an overall reduction in admissions for all stroke types during the outbreak's peak and in the number of stroke code activations and intravenous thrombolysis treatments, results that were independent of the COVID-19 incidence rate. Participants reported a delay in workflow metrics and a reduction of admissions to stroke units, outpatient clinics and rehabilitation therapies. Specific pathways and protocols for managing stroke patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been established. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak has jeopardised all phases of stroke care. As a consequence, some patients with stroke did not receive adequate treatment.","Alonso de Leciñana, María; Castellanos, Mar; Ayo-Martín, Óscar; Morales, Ana",,,478

Vaccination against IB virus (IBV) is an important control measure against the disease. The objective of the present study was to test Avishield IB GI-13, the vaccine candidate against IBV, strain V-173/11 (GI-13 genotype), according to European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) efficacy requirements. Laboratory study on specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens showed 100% protection against challenge 10 days after vaccination of 1-7 day-old chickens by three recommended routes. Duration of immunity was shown to be at least 8 weeks after vaccination. Chickens with maternally derived antibodies (MDA) were 100% protected against challenge 21 and 35 days after vaccination. Testing of the vaccine candidate in field conditions on commercial broiler and layer farms showed 80-90% protection against homologous challenge after spray (broilers and layers) or oral (broilers) vaccine administration. Serum antibodies were monitored during the studies, and although good seroconversion was observed in MDA-positive chickens 34 days after vaccination or later, the data from SPF chickens indicate that non-humoral immunity is important in protection against challenge. Neutralizing antibodies in tears were detected, however, their level could not be fully linked with individual protection scores. A cross-protection study showed that administration of the combination of Avishield IB H120 vaccine and Avishield IB GI-13 vaccine candidate at day 1, confers good protection against heterologous QX-like challenge. Stability of the vaccine after reconstitution in 0.2% skimmed milk solution or distilled water at room temperature was confirmed over the period of 3 h. The vaccine candidate fully complied with Ph. Eur. requirements, with very good protection levels, indicating that it can be administered already at 1 day of age by spray at the hatchery or at 7 days of age by drinking water on the farm.","Kutle, Leonida; Ljuma Skupnjak, Lana; Vrdoljak, Anto; Jankovic, Davor; Boelm, Gert Jan; Kelemen, Ferenc; Zorman Rojs, Olga; Millecam, Joske",Viral immunol,,478

469381,Effect of COVID-19 on delivery plans and postnatal depression scores of pregnant women,2020,"Elizabethkingia meningoseptica has been considered a rare nosocomial cause of pneumonia, especially in the adult population. Risk factors include immunosuppression, recent hospitalizations, and procedures. We present a rare case of community-acquired Elizabethkingia meningoseptica pneumonia (CAP) in an adult without risk factors. 57-year-old Male, past medical history of hypertension & a solitary kidney presented with one week of generalized weakness, 30-lb weight-loss, productive cough & intermittent fevers. He had no history of malignancy, recent travel, sick contacts nor exposure to pools, bodies of water or fish. He denied any history of lung disease nor tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. Laboratory studies revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance, lactic acidosis, non-reactive HIV and negative COVID-19 tests. Chest radiograph revealed right apical lung consolidation;computed tomography of the chest revealed a patchy ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe (RUL). On examination he was found to have diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezing and productive cough. The patient was admitted for treatment of CAP with hyperreactive airways. In the ER, the patient was empirically started on methylprednisolone, ceftriaxone and azithromycin. He subsequently underwent a bronchoscopy with washing, protected & cytology brushings of the RUL that revealed multidrug-resistant Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, susceptible to ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Patient was transitioned to ciprofloxacin with improvement of his clinical status as well as the RUL opacity. This case highlights several important factors. First, it allows further investigation on Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, a rare gram-negative, rarely infectious, aerobic bacillus prevalent in natural water sources & soil. Incidence of 5-10 cases per state per year in the US;involving pediatric bacteremia & meningitis, in immunocompromised states (cystic fibrosis). However, it is rarely a cause of CAP or nosocomial pneumonia in adults. This microbe is associated with the intensive care unit (ICU), including mechanical ventilation, insertion of invasive lines/devices, and immunocompromised states. Interestingly, exposure to water sources within hospitals, including bronchoscopy, can be a source. However, our patient presented with clearly defined pneumonia, then had a bronchoscopy. Second, we learn the multidrug resistance of this pathogen (β-lactams, aminoglycosides, carbapenems), and the sensitivities (fluoroquinolones and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) lending to a difficult eradication. Third, CAP from Elizabethkingia meningoseptica highlights the importance of identifying various risk factors for the development of pneumonia. By shedding light to this pathogen, we hope to further improve the identification and treatment of CAP secondary to Elizabethkingia meningoseptica.","Jaffe, A.

469676,COVID-19 Infection Causing Atypical Thyroiditis,2021,"Purpose: Based on social exchange theory, the study examines the influence of informational and relational internal communication on cognitive and affective responses and job engagement during organizational crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected by means of an online survey among people working in organizations with a minimum of 10 employees (N = 1,033) and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: Results show that informational and relational communication as organizational resources have a significant but distinct influence on how employees support their employer during the crisis. While informational communication influences employees' acceptance of managerial decisions, relational communication exerts most influence on affective commitment, which is the strongest driver of job engagement. Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional design, specific crisis situation and geographic location are limitations of the study. Practical implications: Delivering relevant information to employees quickly and reliably is important. Yet, relationship-oriented communication that demonstrates appreciation and allows for participation has even stronger effects on job engagement, which is essential to mastering challenges arising from a crisis. Social implications: During the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations demanded much from their employees. In exchange, organizations should provide the resources information, status and love (Foa and Foa, 1980) by means of internal crisis communication. Originality/value: The study demonstrates the role of different types of internal communication during organizational crises used to convey organizational resources, and it highlights the mediating role of acceptance and commitment to enhance employees' engagement at work. © 2021, Sabine Einwiller, Christopher Ruppel and Julia Stranzl.","Einwiller, S.; Ruppel, C.; Stranzl, J.",Journal of Communication Management,,478

STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review was conducted following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Statement. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies comprising 83 neonates born to mothers diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 were included in the present systematic review. Among these neonates, three were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at 16, 36, and 72 hours after birth, respectively, by nasopharyngeal swab real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests; another six had elevated virus-specific antibody levels in serum samples collected after birth, but negative RT-PCR test results. However, without positive RT-PCR tests of amniotic fluid, placenta, or cord blood, there is a lack of virologic evidence for intrauterine vertical transmission. CONCLUSION: There is currently no direct evidence to support intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Additional RT-PCR tests on amniotic fluid, placenta, and cord blood are needed to ascertain the possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission. For pregnant women infected during their first and second trimesters, further studies focusing on long-term outcomes are needed. KEY POINTS: · We review neonates of mothers diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).. · No direct virologic evidence of vertical transmission has been reported.. · No evidence that cesarean delivery is safer than vaginal delivery.. · More RT-PCR tests on amniotic fluid, placenta, and cord blood are recommended..","Yang, Ziyi; Liu, Yi",Am. j. perinatol,,478

Besides conventional care, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an equally important treatment for patients with COVID-19 suffering from respiratory, physical and psychological disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of PR on the inpatients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: This study was a self-pre- and post-control prospective clinical trial, which totally recruited 31 inpatients confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR. They were performed 3-week PR. The demographic data, medical records, symptoms, laboratory findings and chest computed tomographic (CT) scans of patients were collected at baseline. The effect of PR was assessed by questionnaires before PR as well as after 2- and 3-week PR. RESULTS: After 3-week PR and treatment, neutrophil percentage decreased, while lymphocyte percentage and lymphocyte count increased (before vs. 2 weeks after PR respectively: P=0.001; P=0.001; P<0.0001). Besides, CRP and procalcitonin reduced significantly (before vs. after respectively: P<0.0001; P=0.023). Patients' oxygen intake decreased and oxygen saturation increased significantly. Meanwhile, PR relieved the patients' symptoms of cough and dyspnea, improved the patients' self-care ability, physical fitness and mental state significantly. Activities of daily living (ADL) score increased and Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC) decreased after PR. CONCLUSIONS: PR can relieve symptoms, enhance health-related quality of life, improve respiratory muscle function and alleviate disease-related anxiety and depression of severe patients with COVID-19. PR should be provided throughout the diseases management process, regardless of whether the patient is hospitalized or at home.","Sun, Jiaolin; Liu, Jia; Li, Hong; Shang, Cuixia; Li, Tingting; Ji, Wenwen; Wu, Jing; Han, Xu; Shi, Zhihong",Ann Palliat Med,,478

471210,Abstract #1004348: Grave's Disease after COVID-19 Infection,2021,"AIMS: The role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers on the course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is debated. We assessed the association between chronic use of RAAS blockers and mortality among inpatients with COVID-19 and explored reasons for discrepancies in the literature. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included adult hypertensive patients from a prospective nationwide cohort of 3512 inpatients with COVID-19 up to June 30, 2020. Cox proportional hazard models with various adjustment or propensity weighting methods were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) of 30-day mortality for chronic users versus non-users of RAAS blockers. We analyzed data of 1160 hypertensive patients: 719 (62%) were male and 777 (67%) were older than 65 years. The main comorbidities were diabetes (n = 416, 36%), chronic cardiac disease (n = 401, 35%), and obesity (n = 340, 29%); 705 (61%) received oxygen therapy. We recorded 135 (11.6%) deaths within 30 days of diagnosis. We found no association between chronic use of RAAS blockers and mortality (unadjusted HR = 1.13, 95% CI [0.8-1.6]; propensity inverse probability treatment weighted HR = 1.09 [0.86-1.39]; propensity standardized mortality ratio weighted HR = 1.08 [0.79-1.47]). Our comprehensive review of previous studies highlighted that significant associations were mostly found in unrestricted populations with inappropriate adjustment, or with biased in-hospital exposure measurement. CONCLUSION: Our results do not support previous concerns regarding these drugs, nor a potential protective effect as reported in previous poorly designed studies and meta-analyses. RAAS blockers should not be discontinued during the pandemic, while in-hospital management of these drugs will be clarified by randomized trials.

We present a large field experiment (N = 47,306) testing 19 nudges delivered to patients via text message and designed to boost adoption of the influenza vaccine. Our findings suggest that text messages sent prior to a primary care visit can boost vaccination rates by an average of 5%. Overall, interventions performed better when they were 1) framed as reminders to get flu shots that were already reserved for the patient and 2) congruent with the sort of communications patients expected to receive from their healthcare provider (i.e., not surprising, casual, or interactive). The best-performing intervention in our study reminded patients twice to get their flu shot at their upcoming doctor's appointment and indicated it was reserved for them.

The disease was initially reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Diabetes is a risk factor associated with adverse outcomes. Herein, our objective was to investigate the characteristics of laboratory findings of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This was a retrospective study and included 80 T2DM patients of Jinling Hospital from 2010 to 2020, as well as 76 COVID-19 patients without T2DM and 55 COVID-19 patients with T2DM who were treated at Huoshen hill Hospital from February 11 to March 18, 2020. We then compared the differences in laboratory test results between the three groups. RESULTS: The levels of lymphocytes, uric acid (UA), and globulin in the T2DM group were significantly higher. In contrast, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH)levels were lower than those in the COVID-19 (p < 0.05) and COVID-19 + T2DM groups (p < 0.05). No considerable difference was observed regarding the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), white blood cell (WBC), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), globulin, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the three groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: T2DM patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed decreased levels of body mass index (BMI), lymphocytes, UA, and albumin, and increased CRP levels. The decreased BMI, UA, and albumin levels may be associated with oxidative stress response and nutritional consumption. The decreased lymphocyte counts and increased CRP levels may be related to the infection.","Jing Liang, Jing; Liu, Jun; Chen, Yong; Ye, Bo; Li, Na; Wang, Xiao; Tang, Min; Shao, Jiaqing",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,478

The review found various individual-and organizational-level barriers and facilitators. The findings suggest that healthcare system constraints that make it difficult for healthcare workers to implement IPC guidelines require urgent prioritisation. This will help lay the foundation for addressing the more individual-level barriers potentially discouraging HCW from implementing IPC guidelines. We draw attention to pan-African initiatives for enhancing healthcare workers’ capacity to undertake IPC measures at such a critical time.","Cooper, Sara; Wiyeh, Alison; Schmidt, Bey-Marrié; Wiysonge, Charles Shey",Pan Afr.

METHODS: Age, neutrophil(NEU)-to-lymphocyte (LYM) ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte (MON) ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 93 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were investigated and compared. The receiver operating characteristic curve was applied to determine the thresholds for five bio-markers, and their prognostic values were assessed via the Kaplan-Meier curve and multivariate COX regression models. RESULTS: The median age was 46.4 years old, and 37cases were females. A total of 27.8% of patients had been to Wuhan, and 73.1% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (83.8%) and cough (70.9%) were the two most common symptoms. Elevated NLR and age were significantly associated with illness severity. The binary logistic analysis identified elevated NLR (hazard risk [HR] 2.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.98-4.57) and age (HR 2.52, 95% CI 1.65-4.83) as independent factors for poor clinical outcome of COVID-19. NLR exhibited the largest area under the curve at 0.841, with the highest specificity (63.6%) and sensitivity (88%).

During surgery the correct setting of operative room (OR) is mandatory to reduce the risk of contamination. Personal protection equipment (PPE), specific devices, and planned OR setting are essential during surgery in pandemic COVID-19. Methods: Medline, PubMed, Scientific societies recommendations, and guidelines were consulted to identify articles reporting the setup of OR during pandemic COVID-19. Results: OR must have a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter with negative pressure and a high air exchange cycle rate. Every supply kit should be packed and placed in the OR before patient arrival. A detailed checklist of equipment and devices is necessary. Personal PPE at the highest level should be provided to every HCP (Association of the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation [AAMI]-Level-III surgical gowns; double latex-free gloves with Acceptable Quality Level <1.0; FFP3 or powered air-purifying respirator masks with face shield). Anesthesia should be performed with a rapid sequence intubation. During surgery energy devices should be settled to the lower level in combination with a smoke evacuation switch pen with disposable smoke evacuation HEPA filter to minimize surgical smoke spread. During laparoscopy low pneumoperitoneum pressures and aspiration systems must be provided. Conclusions: Emergency surgery during pandemic COVID-19 increases the risk for every HCP in the OR. A theoretical risk of transmission from the surgical field exists. It is mandatory the adoption of strong strategies to reduce the risk of contamination in the OR.","Perrone, Gennaro; Giuffrida, Mario; Bellini, Valentina; Lo Coco, Alessandro; Pattonieri, Vittoria; Bonati, Elena; Del Rio, Paolo; Bignami, Elena Giovanna; Catena, Fausto","J. laparoendosc. adv. surg. tech., Part A",,478

In the 3-month lockdown that started on 23 March 2020, 20% of the workforce was deemed to be pursuing essential jobs. The other 80%% were either furloughed, which meant being supported by the government to not work, or working from home. Based on travel journey data between zones (trips were decomposed into essential and non-essential trips. Despite some big regional differences within the UK, we find that essential workers have much the same spatial patterning as non-essential for all occupational groups containing essential and non-essential workers. Also, the amount of travel time saved by working from home during the Pandemic is roughly the same proportion -80%-as the separation between essential and non-essential workers. Further, the loss of travel, reduction in workers, reductions in retail spending as well as increases in use of parks are examined in different London boroughs using Google Mobility Reports which give us a clear picture of what has happened over the last 6 months since the first Lockdown.

COVID-19 associated pneumonia develops into ARDS due to rapid progression of hypoxia. Although arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) should be implemented to confirm this deterioration, it is not easy to obtain such tests in the COVID-19 environment. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine whether oxygen saturation (SpO2) and SpO2/fraction of inhaled oxygen (FiO2) (SF ratio) predicts ARDS and mortality. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study that enrolled COVID-19 pneumonia patients requiring oxygen therapy from Feb 2020 to May 2020. Of 100 COVID-19 pneumonia cases, we compared 59 cases of pneumonia requiring oxygen, divided into ARDS and non-ARDS pneumonia requiring oxygen. The factors affecting mortality were investigated. Results: At the time of admission, the SpO2, FiO2, and SF ratios of the ARDS group were significantly different from those of the non-ARDS pneumonia requiring oxygen support group (P <0.001, respectively). With respect to predicting occurrence of ARDS, the SF ratio on admission and the SF ratio at exacerbation showed an overall area under the curve of 85.7% and 88.8% (P < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified the SF ratio at exacerbation (HR, 0.916; 95% CI, 0.846-0.991; P = 0.029) and National Early Warning Score (NEWS) (HR, 1.277; 95% CI, 1.010-1.615; P = 0.041) as significant predictors of mortality. Conclusions: The SF ratio on admission and the SF ratio at exacerbation can predict occurrence of ARDS. The SF ratio at exacerbation and NEWS has a significant effect on mortality.","Choi, Keum-Ju; Hong, Hyo-Lim; Kim, Eun Jin",,,478

480126,Orbitofrontal involvement in a neuroCOVID-19 patient,2020,"In December 2019, a new virus (initially called 'Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV' and later renamed to SARS-CoV-2) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (coronavirus disease COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread to other parts of China and other countries around the world, despite China's massive efforts to contain the disease within Hubei. As with the original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 and with seasonal influenza, geographic information systems and methods, including, among other application possibilities, online real-or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and contacts across space and time, are proving indispensable for timely and effective epidemic monitoring and response. This paper offers pointers to, and describes, a range of practical online/mobile GIS and mapping dashboards and applications for tracking the 2019/2020 coronavirus epidemic and associated events as they unfold around the world. Some of these dashboards and applications are receiving data updates in near-real-time (at the time of writing), and one of them is meant for individual users (in China) to check if the app user has had any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the recent past.

The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a public debate on density in the city. While some initially blamed density for the spread of the virus, others rightly cautioned against those claims. As the pandemic progressed, an imaginary of density-as-pathology gave way to a more nuanced geographical understanding of the urban dimensions of the crisis, focused on connections, spatial conditions, domestic ?overcrowding? and poverty. Throughout, an interrogation and reflection on urban density and its future unfolded, throwing into question the historical relationship between ?value? and ?population? in understandings of density. I argue for a new politics of value based on shifts in three interconnected domains ? governance, form and knowledge ? and identify implications for research on density in urban studies.","McFarlane, Colin",Urban Studies,,478

Little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HRQoL of IBD patients. We aimed to evaluate HRQoL in IBD patient's pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic using the IBD-disk questionnaire and explore associations between socio demographic factors, disease types, severity and impaired HRQoL in patients with IBD. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care centre in Saudi Arabia between November 2019 and March 2020 at the outpatient IBD clinics. The HRQoL of patients was assessed using the 10-item IBD-disk questionnaire. Results: A total of 59 IBD patients (40 Crohn's disease, 19 Ulcerative colitis) with a mean disease duration of 3.5 years were included. Most of the patients (77.97%) were on biologics while 35.59% were on immune modulators, 16.94% on 5-ASA, and 3.38% were on corticosteroids. There was no difference between any of the 10 IBD-disk variables pre and post-COVID-19 pandemic apart from the perception of body image, where there was a slightly more negative perception with an increase from 2.53 to 3.39 (P = 0.05) There was no significant difference in HRQoL between patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in any of domains. Conclusion: The current study showed that disability and HRQoL appears to be unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic among our cohort, however further studies with longer follow up and larger sample size is needed.","Azzam, Nahla A; Aljebreen, Abdulrahman; Almuhareb, Arwa; Almadi, Majid A",,,478
481332,Tick paralysis in a free-ranging bobcat (Lynx rufus),2020,"mRNA based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have shown exceptional clinical efficacy providing robust protection against severe disease. However, our understanding of transcriptional and repertoire changes following full vaccination remains incomplete. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and functional assays to compare humoral and cellular responses to two doses of mRNA vaccine with responses observed in convalescent individuals with asymptomatic disease. Our analyses revealed enrichment of spike-specific B cells, activated CD4 T cells, and robust antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4 T cell responses in all vaccinees. On the other hand, CD8 T cell responses were both weak and variable. Interestingly, clonally expanded CD8 T cells were observed in every vaccinee, as observed following natural infection. TCR gene usage, however, was variable, reflecting the diversity of repertoires and MHC polymorphism in the human population. Natural infection induced expansion of larger CD8 T cell clones occupied distinct clusters, likely due to the recognition of a broader set of viral epitopes presented by the virus not seen in the mRNA vaccine. Our study highlights a coordinated adaptive immune response where early CD4 T cell responses facilitate the development of the B cell response and substantial expansion of effector CD8 T cells, together capable of contributing to future recall responses.","Sureshchandra, Suhas; Lewis, Sloan A.; Doratt, Brianna; Jankeel, Allen; Ibraim, Izabela; Messaoudi, Ilhem",,,478

481809,Hemostasis profile in COVID-19 infection,2020,"Bedside lung ultrasound (LUS) can play a role in the setting of the SarsCoV2 pneumonia pandemic. To evaluate the clinical and LUS features of COVID-19 in the ED and their potential prognostic role, a cohort of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients underwent LUS upon admission in the ED. LUS score was derived from 12 fields. A prevalent LUS pattern was assigned depending on the presence of interstitial syndrome only (Interstitial Pattern), or evidence of subpleural consolidations in at least two fields (Consolidation Pattern). The endpoint was 30-day mortality. The relationship between hemogasanalysis parameters and LUS score was also evaluated. Out of 312 patients, only 36 (11.5%) did not present lung involvment, as defined by LUS score < 1. The majority of patients were admitted either in a general ward (53.8%) or in intensive care unit (9.6%), whereas 106 patients (33.9%) were discharged from the ED. In-hospital mortality was 25.3%, and 30-day survival was 67.6%. A LUS score > 13 had a 77.2% sensitivity and a 71.5% specificity (AUC 0.814; p < 0.001) in predicting mortality. LUS alterations were more frequent (64%) in the posterior lower fields. LUS score was related with P/F (R2 0.68; p < 0.0001) and P/F at FiO2 = 21% (R2 0.59; p < 0.0001). The correlation between LUS score and P/F was not influenced by the prevalent ultrasound pattern. LUS represents an effective tool in both defining diagnosis and stratifying prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The correlation between LUS and hemogasanalysis parameters underscores its role in evaluating lung structure and function.","Secco, Gianmarco; Delorenzo, Marzia; Salinaro, Francesco; Zattera, Caterina; Barcella, Bruno; Resta, Flavia; Sabena, Anna; Vezzoni, Giulia; Bonzano, Marco; Briganti, Federica; Cappa, Giovanni; Zugnoni, Francesca; Demitry, Lorenzo; Mojoli, Francesco; Baldanti, Fausto; Bruno, Raffaele; Perlini, Stefano",Intern. emerg. med,,478

It is still threatening the world population. Here, we aimed to produce hyperimmune sera that contain immunoglobulin G and F(ab')2 fragments sourced from horse antibodies as an urgent response to the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 was produced and inactivated with three different methods [formaldehyde (FA), formaldehyde and binary ethylene amine (FA+BEI), and heat treatment]. After in vitro inactivation control, immunogens were mixed with Freund?s adjuvant, thereafter horses (n: 2 for FA, 4 for FA + BEI, 2 for Heat inactivation) and New Zealand rabbits (n: 6 for FA, 6 for FA + BEI, 6 for Heat inactivation) were immunized four times. Neutralizing antibody levels of the sera were measured at the 4th, 6th and 8th weeks. When the antibodies were detected at the peak level, plasma was collected from horses and hyperimmune sera procured after the purification process. RESULTS: Horses and rabbits produced highly neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 in FA and FA + BEI inactivation groups, foreign proteins were removed effectively after purification. CONCLUSION: This study presents a profitable practice to develop horse specific antisera against SARS-CoV-2 for emergency and low-cost response. In further studies, new purification methods can be used to increase the efficiency of the final product.","Pakdemirli, Ahu; Çaliskan, Elvin; Hacioglu, Sabri; Danyer, Erdem; Kardogan, Özlem; Ergün Kurt, Züleyha; Yildirim, Özcan; Taskaya, Hakan; Ündar, Bora; Sezgin, Yasemin; Ergin, Gencay; Ekici, Himmet; Ülker, Ufuk; Taçbas, Erkan; Çakir, Sahin; Bülbül, Ramazan; Bebek, Mustafa; Sarper, Meral; Dülger, Dilek; Sari, Ümmü Sena; Ergin, Fatma; Kabakli, Özden; Yarali, Cevdet",Turkish journal of medical sciences,,478

We address the question of how HRI research can continue in an environment where physical distancing is the most effective approach to containing the spread of the disease. In this paper we present a pilot study that indicates that Remote-HRI (R-HRI) studies can be a feasible alternative. The results suggest, importantly, that whether the participant interacts with the robot in-person (but physically-distanced) or remotely, their perception of the robots is unaffected. We observed increased effort and frustration by participants when interacting remotely with the robot - for which there may be an underlying cultural cause. However, all participants completed their tasks with the robot and had a neutral to positive experience using it. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.","Gittens, C.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Scientific databases were systematically searched to identify relevant trials of HCQ/CQ in COVID-19 published until 10th September, 2020. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tools for randomized trials and non-randomized studies of interventions were used to assess risk of bias of included studies. A 10-item Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) harms extension was used to assess for quality of harms reporting. RESULTS: Sixteen trials including fourteen randomized and two non-randomized trials met the inclusion criteria. The results from included trials were conflicting, lacked effect estimates adjusted for confounders and baseline disease severity or comorbidities in many cases, and recruited a fairly small cohort of patients. None of the clinical trials met the CONSORT criteria in full for reporting harms data in clinical trials. None of the sixteen trials had an overall 'low' risk of bias, while four of the trials had 'high', 'critical', and 'serious' risk of bias. Biases observed in these trials arise from the randomization process, potential deviation from intended interventions, outcome measurement, selective reporting, confounding, participant selection, and/or classification of interventions CONCLUSION: In general, the quality of currently available evidence for the effectiveness of CQ/HCQ in COVID-19 is suboptimal. The importance of a properly designed and reported clinical trial cannot be overemphasized amid the COVID-19 pandemic and its dismissal could lead to poorer clinical and policy decisions resulting in wastage of already stretched invaluable healthcare resources.","Mazhar, Faizan; Hadi, Muhammad Abdul; Kow, Chia Siang; Marran, Albaraa Mohammed N; Merchant, Hamid A; Hasan, Syed Shahzad",Int. j. infect. dis,,478

The aim of this study is a mid-term review of the sequelae on plain chest radiography (CXR) in patients with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, assessing the persistence of residual lesions in the control CXR and analysing their possible relationship with epidemiological factors, risk factors, treatments received and initial radiological patterns. RESULTS: A total of 143 patients (52 women and 91 men) were analysed. Mean age was 64 years. Radiological complete resolution (CR) was observed in 104 (73%) and partial resolution (PR) in 39 (27%). Of the risk factors only age was significantly related to persistence of residual lesions (OR 1.06 CI 95% (1.02,1.10). In relation to treatments, significant differences were found with tocilizumab and glucocorticoids, where treated patients had a higher risk of residual lesions (OR 2.44 (1.03,5.80) and 3.05(1.43,6.51) respectively. In the analysis of radiological patterns, significant differences were observed in patients with peripheral condensations in the acute course and a pattern of early radiological worsening. A clinical-radiological dissociation was evident: 83% of patients with residual lesions had no respiratory symptoms. DISCUSSION: COVID19 pneumonias may have a slower radiological resolution in older patients with certain initial radiological patterns, but the development of pulmonary fibrosis in these patients is still questionable.","Gómez Herrero, Helena; Galbete, Arkaitz; Álvarez Galván, Begoña; Caballero García, Pilar; Vicaría Fernández, Iván",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),,478

RESULTS: Mean ± SD age was 51.8 ± 16.7 years. Mean ± SD body mass index (BMI) was 27.4 ± 4.7 kg/m2. 26% (9/34) had obesity, with BMI above 30 kg/m2. Fifteen patients had BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m2. The mean length of hospital stay was longer for those with a BMI >25 kg/m2 (n = 24) than for those with a normal BMI (19.2 vs. 16.0 days, p = 0.08). Comparing people with obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2 or above) to those without obesity, the difference was larger (20.6 vs. 16.0 days, p = 0.06). A trend for correlation between body weight and the time to negative detection of RdRp gene was found (r = 0.33, p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the need for priority of early detection and testing, and early therapy for people with obesity and COVID-19 infections.","Dicker, Dror; Lev, Shaul; Gottesman, Tamar; Kournos, Tatiana; Dotan, Maya; Ashorov, Nina; Marcoviciu, Dana; Golan, Rachel",Obes Facts,,478
485153,Delayed adverse events after using two different types of hyaluronic acid-based dermal fillers,2020,"Objective: The major objectives of the article were to explore the effects of the fear and anxiety of Covid-19 and business opportunity recognition on start-up self-efficacy, entrepreneurial intention, and behaviour, as well as to test entrepreneurial intention-behaviour association. Research Design & Methods: The study was performed by means of an online survey questionnaire conducted on 405 students at a Vietnamese university. The survey questionnaire was developed based on prior research. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was utilised to test the research model and hypotheses. Findings: The results illustrated that the fear and anxiety of Covid-19 have a negative impact on start-up self-efficacy and entrepreneurial intention, while business opportunity recognition is strongly and positively correlated with entrepreneurial self-efficacy, entrepreneurial intention, and behaviour. In addition, entrepreneurial intention is found to be the most important antecedent to predict actual start-up behaviour whereas entrepreneurial intention significantly mediates the association between entrepreneurial self-efficacy and entrepreneurial behaviour. Implications & Recommendations: The study offers practical contributions for both universities and policymakers to foster youths' entrepreneurial activities and manage the negative outcome of Covid-19 on students' mental health. Contribution & Value Added: This research contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by addressing the notable gap when testing the linkages between entrepreneurial intention and behaviour. Furthermore, the finding confirms that the fear and anxiety of Covid-19 can decrease entrepreneurial self-efficacy, intention, and behaviour, while business opportunity recognition fosters entrepreneurial activities.","Loan, L.; Cong, D.

However, the long-term effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the organs of recovered patients remains unclear. This study is to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the spleen and T lymphocytes. Seventy-six patients recovered from COVID-19, including 66 cases of moderate pneumonia and 10 cases of severe pneumonia were enrolled in the observation group. The control group consisted of 55 age-matched healthy subjects. The thickness and length of spleen were measured by using B-ultrasound and the levels of T lymphocytes were detected by flow cytometry. Results showed that the mean length of spleen in the observation group was 89.57 ± 11.49 mm, which was significantly reduced compared with that in the control group (103.82 ± 11.29 mm, p < 0.001). The mean thicknesses of spleen between observation group and control group were 29.97 ± 4.04 mm and 32.45 ± 4.49 mm, respectively, and the difference was significant (p < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed in the size of spleen between common pneumonia and severe pneumonia (p > 0.05). In addition, the decreased count of T lymphocyte was observed in part of recovered patients. The counts of T suppressor lymphocytes in patients with severe pneumonia were significantly decreased compared with those with moderate pneumonia (p = 0.005). Therefore, these data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection affects the size of spleen and T lymphocytes.","Xie, Lixia; Lin, Yuanlan; Deng, Yushu; Lei, Bin",Viral immunol,,478

Previous research has shown that negative shocks impair cognitive function and change risk, time and social preferences. In this study, we analyze the results of a longitudinal multi-country survey conducted in Italy (N = 1652), Spain (N = 1660) and the United Kingdom (N = 1578). We measure cognitive function using the Cognitive Reflection Test and preferences traits (risk, time and social preferences) using an experimentally validated set of questions to assess the differences between people exposed to a shock compared to the rest of the sample. We measure four possible types of shocks: labor market shock, health shock, occurrence of stressful events, and mental health shock. Additionally, we randomly assign participants to groups with either a recall of negative events (more specifically, a mild reinforcement of stress or of fear/anxiety), or to a control group (to recall neutral or joyful memories), in order to assess whether or not stress and negative emotions drive a change in preferences. Results show that people affected by shocks performed worse in terms of cognitive functioning, are more risk loving, and are more prone to punish others (negative reciprocity). Data do not support the hypotheses that the result is driven by stress or by negative emotions.","Bogliacino, Francesco; Codagnone, Cristiano; Montealegre, Felipe; Folkvord, Frans; Gómez, Camilo; Charris, Rafael; Liva, Giovanni; Lupiáñez-Villanueva, Francisco; Veltri, Giuseppe A",Sci Rep,,478

490238,Medical Rehabilitation in Pandemics: Towards a New Perspective,2020,"BACKGROUND: The perceived threat of a contagious virus may lead people to be distrustful of immigrants and out-groups. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the salient politicized discourses of blaming Chinese people for spreading the virus have fueled over 2000 reports of anti-Asian racial incidents and hate crimes in the United States. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to investigate the relationships between news consumption, trust, intergroup contact, and prejudicial attitudes toward Asians and Asian Americans residing in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compare how traditional news, social media use, and biased news exposure cultivate racial attitudes, and the moderating role of media use and trust on prejudice against Asians is examined. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was completed in May 2020. A total of 430 US adults (mean age 36.75, SD 11.49 years; n=258, 60% male) participated in an online survey through Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. Respondents answered questions related to traditional news exposure, social media use, perceived trust, and their top three news channels for staying informed about the novel coronavirus. In addition, intergroup contact and racial attitudes toward Asians were assessed. We performed hierarchical regression analyses to test the associations. Moderation effects were estimated using simple slopes testing with a 95% bootstrap confidence interval approach. RESULTS: Participants who identified as conservatives (ß=.08, P=.02), had a personal infection history (ß=.10, P=.004), and interacted with Asian people frequently in their daily lives (ß=.46, P<.001) reported more negative attitudes toward Asians after controlling for sociodemographic variables. Relying more on traditional news media (ß=.08, P=.04) and higher levels of trust in social media (ß=.13, P=.007) were positively associated with prejudice against Asians. In contrast, consuming news from left-leaning outlets (ß=-.15, P=.001) and neutral outlets (ß=-.13, P=.003) was linked to less prejudicial attitudes toward Asians. Among those who had high trust in social media, exposure had a negative relationship with prejudice. At high levels of trust in digital websites and apps, frequent use was related to less unfavorable attitudes toward Asians. CONCLUSIONS: Experiencing racial prejudice among the Asian population during a challenging pandemic can cause poor psychological outcomes and exacerbate health disparities. The results suggest that conservative ideology, personal infection history, frequency of intergroup contact, traditional news exposure, and trust in social media emerge as positive predictors of prejudice against Asians and Asian Americans, whereas people who get COVID-19 news from left-leaning and balanced outlets show less prejudice. For those who have more trust in social media and digital news, frequent use of these two sources is associated with lower levels of prejudice. Our findings highlight the need to reshape traditional news discourses and use social media and mobile news apps to develop credible messages for combating racial prejudice against Asians.","Tsai, Jiun-Yi; Phua, Joe; Pan, Shuya; Yang, Chia-Chen",J Med Internet Res,,478
490273,Cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19: familial cluster of urticarial rash,2020,"Background: : The COVID-19 outbreak has led to an unprecedented crisis in Spain. After Italy, the spread of the virus was quick, and Spain became the second epicenter in Europe by number of cases and deceased. To tackle the outbreak and contain the spread, the Spanish authorities undertook exceptional measures based on a generalized lockdown by which the majority of the economic activity ceased for several weeks. Objectives: : The goal of this paper is to examine the spread of COVID-19 in Spain from February to May 2020, as well as the public policies and technologies used to contain the evolution of the pandemic. In particular it aims to assess the effectivity of the policies applied within the different autonomous communities. Cases and deaths are presented until August as well as the main changes in containment and mitigation measures. Methods: : Data was collected from various official sources, including government reports, press releases and datasets provided by national and international level institutions. Results: : We show that the main measure to contain the spread of the pandemic was a stringent confinement policy enforced through fines. It resulted in a substantial reduction in the mobility and the economic activity. At a regional level, the negative consequences of the crisis affected differently across regions.","Henríquez, Josefa; Almorox, Eduardo Gonzalo; Garcia-Goñi, Manuel; Paolucci, Francesco",,,478
490304,Overall management strategies for colorectal cancer patients during the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious virus that has created a health crisis for people all over the world. Social distancing has proved to be an effective non-pharmaceutical measure to slow down the spread of COVID-19. As unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a flexible mobile platform, it is a promising option to use UAV for social distance monitoring. Therefore, we propose a lightweight pedestrian detection network to accurately detect pedestrians by human head detection in real-time and then calculate the social distancing between pedestrians on UAV images. In particular, our network follows the PeleeNet as backbone and further incorporates the multi-scale features and spatial attention to enhance the features of small objects, like human heads. The experimental results on Merge-Head dataset show that our method achieves 92.22% AP (average precision) and 76 FPS (frames per second), outperforming YOLOv3 models and SSD models and enabling real-time detection in actual applications. The ablation experiments also indicate that multi-scale feature and spatial attention significantly contribute the performance of pedestrian detection. The test results on UAV-Head dataset show that our method can also achieve high precision pedestrian detection on UAV images with 88.5% AP and 75 FPS. In addition, we have conducted a precision calibration test to obtain the transformation matrix from images (vertical images and tilted images) to real-world coordinate. Based on the accurate pedestrian detection and the transformation matrix, the social distancing monitoring between individuals is reliably achieved.

490379,Hemodynamic Profiles of Shock in Patients with COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic there have been contradictions and speculations about the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19. Given that there is an association between vitamin D deficiency and some diseases - including cancer, autoimmune disease and some infectious diseases - a higher incidence and mortality rate in the vitamin-D-deficient COVID-19 population was not a surprise; conversely, some research would argue this relationship. Considering these contradictions, this study aimed to determine the relationship between prognosis and vitamin D level in cases with COVID-19. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 329 confirmed cases of COVID-19 - who were admitted to Kamkar-ArabNia Hospital in Qom city, Iran from March-July 2020 - were categorized into three groups according to vitamin D serum levels (ng/ml): sufficient (>30), insufficient (20-30) and deficient (<20). Prognosis was determined across the groups. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in hospital stay between patients with sufficient and insufficient vitamin D levels (P = 0.007). Adjusting vitamin D levels for confounding variables, linear regression underscored significant differences in the association between length of hospitalization and lower vitamin D levels, with a longer stay noted in insufficient groups (P = 0.002). However, there was no significant difference in the time interval to return to normal oxygen level (from SpO2 < 93%) or death rate between groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: There was a significant association between hospital stay and lower serum vitamin D levels. However, the relationship between vitamin D status and death rate or the time interval to return to normal oxygen levels was not significant.","Nasiri, Maryam; Khodadadi, Javad; Molaei, Sedigheh",Int J Infect Dis,,478
490846,The review of histopathological pulmonary findings of covid-19: What we learned from postmortem biopsy and autopsies;beyond the horizon,2020,"BACKGROUND: Cytokines seen in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are associated with proliferation, differentiation, and survival of plasma cells. Plasma cells are not routinely found in peripheral blood, though may produce virus-neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 later in the course of an infection. METHODS: Using the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Precision Medicine Analytics Platform Registry, we identified hospitalized adult patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and stratified by presence of plasma cells and World Health Organization (WHO) disease severity. To identify plasma cells, we employed a sensitive flow cytometric screening method for highly fluorescent lymphocytes and confirmed these microscopically. Cox regression models were used to evaluate time to death and time to clinical improvement by the presence of plasma cells in patients with severe disease. RESULTS: Of 2301 hospitalized patients with confirmed infection, 371 had plasma cells identified. Patients with plasma cells were more likely to have severe disease, though 86.6% developed plasma cells after onset of severe disease. In patients with severe disease, after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, race, and other covariates associated with disease severity, patients with plasma cells had a reduced hazard of death (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.57; 95% confidence interval: 0.38-0.87; P value: .008). There was no significant association with the presence of plasma cells and time to clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe disease who have detectable plasma cells in the peripheral blood have improved mortality despite adjusting for known covariates associated with disease severity in COVID-19. Further investigation is warranted to understand the role of plasma cells in the immune response to COVID-19.","Boulanger, Mary; Molina, Emily; Wang, Kunbo; Kickler, Thomas; Xu, Yanxun; Garibaldi, Brian T",Am. j. med,,478

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Australian Black Summer Bushfires on health behaviours in people with MS. METHODS: People with MS, carers, healthcare and advocacy professionals were recruited online between May-July 2020 for an online survey and telephone interviews. RESULTS: Survey items relating to health behaviours were completed by 113 people with MS, and 18 people with MS, 4 MS advocates, 5 healthcare professionals, and 2 carers were interviewed. The bushfires affected 34.5% and the pandemic affected 74.3% of survey participants with MS. The pandemic and bushfires caused a decrease in physical activity in 53.8% and 55.3% of participants respectively, as well as increases in unhealthy eating (43.6% and 24.3% respectively) and alcohol consumption (35.4% and 10.5% respectively), and a decrease in typical sleeping patterns (40.5% and 39.5% respectively). Conversely, 27.5% of participants reported an increase in physical activity during the pandemic. Interview data detailed the circumstances and motivations for changes in health behaviours, as well as consequences, including reduced mobility, fitness, mood disturbances, and weight gain. CONCLUSION: There is a need to increase support and health promotion for people with MS to maintain or initiate positive health behaviours, especially in times of adversity.","Marck, C H; Hunter, A; Heritage, B; Gibbs, L; Kermode, A G; Walker, D I; Learmonth, Y C",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,478
491903,COVID-19 prediction models should adhere to methodological and reporting standards,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to analyze associations of comorbidities and medications on infection outcomes. METHODS: Patients with SLE and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 were identified through an established New York University lupus cohort, query of 2 hospital systems, and referrals from rheumatologists. Data were prospectively collected via a web-based questionnaire and review of medical records. Data on baseline characteristics were obtained for all patients with COVID-19 to analyze risk factors for hospitalization. Data were also collected on asymptomatic patients and those with COVID-19-like symptoms who tested negative or were not tested. Statistical analyses were limited to confirmed COVID-19-positive patients. RESULTS: A total of 226 SLE patients were included: 41 with confirmed COVID-19, 19 who tested negative for COVID-19, 42 with COVID-19-like symptoms who did not get tested, and 124 who remained asymptomatic without testing. Of the SLE patients with confirmed COVID-19, hospitalization was required in 24 (59%) and intensive care unit-level of care in 4, and 4 died. Hospitalized patients tended to be older, nonwhite, Hispanic, have higher body mas index (BMI), history of nephritis, and at least 1 comorbidity.

492364,Prevalence and Predictors of Loneliness Among Youth During the Time of COVID-19: A Multinational Study,2021,"This work is about statistical genetics, an interdisciplinary topic between Statistical Physics and Population Biology. Our focus is on the phase of Quasi-Linkage Equilibrium (QLE) which has many similarities to equilibrium statistical mechanics, and how the stability of that phase is lost. The QLE phenomenon was discovered by Motoo Kimura and was extended and generalized to the global genome scale by Neher&Shraiman (2011). What we will refer to as the Kimura-Neher-Shraiman (KNS) theory describes a population evolving due to the mutations, recombination, genetic drift, natural selection (pairwise epistatic fitness). The main conclusion of KNS is that QLE phase exists at sufficiently high recombination rate ($r$) with respect to the variability in selection strength (fitness). Combining these results with the techniques of the Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) we show that in QLE epistatic fitness can be inferred from the knowledge of the (dynamical) distribution of genotypes in a population. Extending upon our earlier work Zeng&Aurell (2020) here we present an extension to high mutation and recombination rate. We further consider evolution of a population at higher selection strength with respect to recombination and mutation parameters ($r$ and $\mu$). We identify a new bi-stable phase which we call the Non-Random Coexistence (NRC) phase where genomic mutations persist in the population without either fixating or disappearing. We also identify an intermediate region in the parameter space where a finite population jumps stochastically between QLE-like state and NRC-like behaviour. The existence of NRC-phase demonstrates that even if statistical genetics at high recombination closely mirrors equilibrium statistical physics, a more apt analogy is non-equilibrium statistical physics with broken detailed balance, where self-sustained dynamical phenomena are ubiquitous.","Dichio, Vito; Zeng, Hong-Li; Aurell, Erik",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.01428v1.pdf,478

Facing the unprecedented global public health crisis caused by COVID-19, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been given high expectations as a promising surveillance complement to clinical testing which had been plagued by limited capacity and turnaround time. In particular, recent studies have highlighted the role WBE may play in being a part of the early warning system. In this study, we briefly discussed the basics of the concept, the benefits and critical points of such an application, the challenges faced by the scientific community, the progress made so far, and what awaits to be addressed by future studies to make the concept work. We identified that the shedding dynamics of infected individuals, especially in the form of a mathematical shedding model, and the back-calculation of the number of active shedders from observed viral load are the major bottlenecks of WBE application in the COVID-19 pandemic that deserve more attention, and the sampling strategy (location, timing, and interval) needs to be optimized to fit the purpose and scope of the WBE project.","Zhu, Yifan; Oishi, Wakana; Maruo, Chikako; Saito, Mayuko; Chen, Rong; Kitajima, Masaaki; Sano, Daisuke",Sci Total Environ,,478

The main purpose of this research is to investigate the factors that affected life satisfaction during the first-wave lockdown in Greece. A web-based survey was developed, and 4305 questionnaires were completed corresponding to all Greek regional units. Statistical modeling (multivariate logistic regression) was performed to evaluate to which extent significant geographical attributes and socioeconomic characteristics are likely to influence life satisfaction during lockdown due to the pandemic. In the course of the present work, some key findings emerged: social distancing and confinement measures affected mostly women in relation to men;there was a strong positive association between life satisfaction and age, especially as regards the older population;changes to employment status, increase in psychosomatic disorders, and increased usage of social media were also likely to negatively impact people’s life satisfaction. By contrast, trust in the government and the media and limited health concerns seem to have a strong association with subjective wellbeing. Finally, life satisfaction does not depend much on geographical characteristics such as urbanity or insularity, highlighting that the lockdown had an impact on the Greek population regardless of the physical isolation.","Anastasiou, Evgenia Duquenne Marie-Noelle",Social Sciences,,478

This global health crisis first appeared in Wuhan, China around December 2019 and due to its extremely contagious nature it had spread to almost 187 countries. Still now no effective method of treatment or vaccine is developed for controlling the disease. Therefore, the sole obliging strategy is to take precautionary measures by repurposing drugs from the pre-existing library of therapeutically potent molecules. In this situation of pandemic this repurposing technique may save the labour-intensive and tiresome process of new drug development. Orientin is a natural flavonoid with several beneficial effects. This phytochemical can be isolated from different plants like tulsi or holy basil, black bamboo, passion flowers etc. and it's antiviral, anti-inflammation, vasodilatation and cardioprotective, radioprotective, neuroprotective, anticarcinogeneic and antinociceptive effects are already established. In this research, it is intriguing to find out whether this molecule can interfere the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and their host receptor GRP78. Our in silico docking and molecular dynamics simulation results indicate the binding of Orientin in the overlapping residues of GRP78 binding region of SARS-CoV-2 spike model and SARS-CoV-2 spike model binding region of GRP78 substrate-binding domain. Therefore, the results included in this research work provide a strong possibility of using Orientin as a promising precautionary or therapeutic measure for COVID-19.","Bhowmik, Arijit; Biswas, Souradeep; Hajra, Subhadip; Saha, Prosenjit",Heliyon,,478
494074,Compilation of the resuscitation guidelines for COVID-19 patients in resource-constrained developing nations,2021,"Rationale: A novel model of phenotypes based on set thresholds of respiratory system compliance (Crs) was recently postulated in context of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In particular, the dissociation between the degree of hypoxemia and Crs was characterized as a distinct ARDS phenotype.Objectives: To determine whether such Crs-based phenotypes existed among patients with ARDS before the COVID-19 pandemic and to closely examine the Crs-mortality relationship.Methods: We undertook a secondary analysis of patients with ARDS, who were invasively ventilated on controlled modes and enrolled in a large, multinational, epidemiological study. We assessed Crs, degree of hypoxemia, and associated Crs-based phenotypic patterns with their characteristics and outcomes.Measurements and Main Results: Among 1,117 patients with ARDS who met inclusion criteria, the median Crs was 30 (interquartile range, 23-40) ml/cm H2O. One hundred thirty-six (12%) patients had preserved Crs (&#8805;50 ml/cm H2O; phenotype with low elastance [""phenotype L""]), and 827 (74%) patients had poor Crs (<40 ml/cm H2O; phenotype with high elastance [""phenotype H""]). Compared with those with phenotype L, patients with phenotype H were sicker and had more comorbidities and higher hospital mortality (32% vs. 45%; P < 0.05). A near complete dissociation between PaO2/FiO2 and Crs was observed. Of 136 patients with phenotype L, 58 (43%) had a PaO2/FiO2 < 150. In a multivariable-adjusted analysis, the Crs was independently associated with hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio per ml/cm H2O increase, 0.988; 95% confidence interval, 0.979-0.996; P = 0.005).Conclusions: A wide range of Crs was observed in non-COVID-19 ARDS. Approximately one in eight patients had preserved Crs. PaO2/FiO2 and Crs were dissociated. Lower Crs was independently associated with higher mortality. The Crs-mortality relationship lacked a clear transition threshold.","Panwar, Rakshit; Madotto, Fabiana; Laffey, John G; van Haren, Frank M P",Am J Respir Crit Care Med,,478

Examining the psychosocial variables that may lead to greater adoption of such precautionary behaviors is critical. The present study examines predictors of precautionary practices against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 709 Mexican participants from 24 states. The study was conducted via online questionnaire between the end of March and the beginning of April 2020, when the pandemic response was in its initial stages in Mexico. The instrument included demographic items, as well as scales assessing COVID-19-resembling symptoms, empathy, impulsivity, anhedonic depression, general health practices, alcohol consumption, and COVID-19-associated precautionary behaviors. Most participants reported adopting limited social distancing or other precautionary behaviors against COVID-19. The results of a structural equation model demonstrated that the presence of COVID-19 symptoms was related to impulsivity and general health behaviors. However, no direct association between precautionary behaviors and the presence of COVID-19 symptoms was found. In turn, precautionary behaviors were more prevalent among participants who reported higher empathy and general health behaviors and were inhibited indirectly by impulsivity via alcohol consumption. Furthermore, the model suggests that anhedonic depression symptoms have a negative indirect effect on precautionary behaviors via general health behaviors. Finally, impulsivity showed a negative direct effect on general health behavior. These results highlight the role that general physical health and mental health play on precautionary behavior and the critical importance of addressing issues such as depression, general health behaviors, and impulsivity in promoting safe actions and the protection of self and others.","Frias-Armenta, M.; Corral-Frias, N.

497110,COVID-19 and melanoma surgery in a dermo-oncology centre in Italy,2021,"During the current COVID-19 pandemic, and especially in the absence of availability of an effective treatment or a vaccine, the main health measure is neither chemical nor biological, but behavioral. To reduce the exponential growth of infections due to the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting overburdening of the healthcare system, many European Countries, parts of the US and Switzerland gradually implemented measures of quarantine and isolation defined as lockdown. This consideration leads to the need to understand how individuals are motivated to protect themselves and others. Recent research suggested that prosocial mental dispositions, such as empathy, might promote adherence to social norms of distancing. Other research conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak indicates, however, that empathy levels might fluctuate according to anxiety linked to the risk of death, and this negatively predicted prosocial willingness. The present protocol proposes a study on whether people's empathic dispositions, interacting with the levels of risk, influence the psychological impact of lockdown. The rationale is that emphatic dispositions, encouraging the acceptance of the lockdown, determine a better psychological adaptation and less distress. One retrospective study will be developed in Switzerland and, if the pandemic conditions force a new wave of lockdown on the population, one prospective study as well. A total of 120 participants will be involved, distinguished by their level of objective risk: (1) high objective risk (COVID-19 positive patients, hospitalized in isolation in post-acute phase); (2) moderate objective risk (COVID-19 positive patients, isolated at home); (3) minimum objective risk (non-positive adults, in lockdown). Measures of perceived risk of being contagious for third parties, empathic dispositions and acceptance of lockdown will be collected. The expected results provide important answers related to the immediate impact of empathic dispositions, effective risk and risk perception on the psychological impact of lockdown during a pandemic outbreak. Data gathered from this study could inform policy makers and public health managers about the best communication strategies that will take into account the various stages of health risk and, in particular, to modulate messages to the population aimed at inducing self-isolation behaviors.","Grignoli, Nicola; Petrocchi, Serena; Bernardi, Sheila; Massari, Ilaria; Traber, Rafael; Malacrida, Roberto; Gabutti, Luca",Front Public Health,,478

Recent works have found substantial changes in sleep and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dreams could give us crucial information about people's well-being, so here we have directly investigated the consequences of lockdown on the oneiric activity in a large Italian sample: 5,988 adults completed a web-survey during lockdown. We investigated sociodemographic and COVID-19-related information, sleep quality (by the Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep Scale), mental health (by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales), dream and nightmare frequency, and related emotional aspects (by the Mannheim Dream Questionnaire). Comparisons between our sample and a population-based sample revealed that Italians are having more frequent nightmares and dreams during the pandemic. A multiple logistic regression model showed the predictors of high dream recall (young age, female gender, not having children, sleep duration) and high nightmare frequency (young age, female gender, modification of napping, sleep duration, intrasleep wakefulness, sleep problem index, anxiety, depression). Moreover, we found higher emotional features of dream activity in workers who have stopped working, in people who have relatives/friends infected by or who have died from COVID-19 and in subjects who have changed their sleep habits. Our findings point to the fact that the predictors of high dream recall and nightmares are consistent with the continuity between sleep mentation and daily experiences. According to the arousal-retrieval model, we found that poor sleep predicts a high nightmare frequency. We suggest monitoring dream changes during the epidemic, and also considering the implications for clinical treatment and prevention of mental and sleep disorders.","Scarpelli, Serena; Alfonsi, Valentina; Mangiaruga, Anastasia; Musetti, Alessandro; Quattropani, Maria Catena; Lenzo, Vittorio; Freda, Maria Francesca; Lemmo, Daniela; Vegni, Elena; Borghi, Lidia; Saita, Emanuela; Cattivelli, Roberto; Castelnuovo, Gianluca; Plazzi, Giuseppe; De Gennaro, Luigi; Franceschini, Christian",J Sleep Res,,478

The risk factors and predictors of prognosis in such cohorts remain uncertain. METHODS: All adults with COVID-19 of moderate severity diagnosed using quantitative RT-PCR and hospitalized at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China, from 1 January to 20 March 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective study. The main outcomes were progression from moderate to severe or critical condition or death. RESULTS: Among the 456 enrolled patients with moderate COVID-19, 251/456 (55.0%) had poor prognosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified higher neutrophil count: lymphocyte count ratio (NLR) on admission (OR 1.032, 95% CI 1.042-1.230, p 0.004) and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) on admission (OR 3.017, 95% CI 1.941-4.690, p < 0.001) were associated with increased OR of poor prognosis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for NLR and CRP in predicting progression to critical condition was 0.77 (95% CI 0.694-0.846, p < 0.001) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.780-0.905, p < 0.001), with a cut-off value of 2.79 and 25.95 mg/L, respectively.

What is the impact of the 2008 financial recession and the COVID-19 recession on fertility treatments and cumulative live births? DESIGN: The study examined annual US natality, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention IVF cycle activity and live birth data from 1999 to 2018 encompassing 3,286,349 treatment cycles, to estimate the age-stratified reduction in IVF cycles undertaken after the 2008 financial recession, with forward quantitative modelling of IVF cycle activity and cumulative live births for 2020 to 2023. RESULTS: The financial recession of 2008 caused a 4-year plateau in fertility treatments with a predicted 53,026 (95% confidence interval [CI] 49,581 to 56,471) fewer IVF cycles and 16,872 (95% CI 16,713 to 17,031) fewer live births. A similar scale of economic recession would cause 67,386 (95% CI 61,686 to 73,086) fewer IVF cycles between 2020 and 2023, with women younger than 35 years overall undertaking 22,504 (95% CI 14,320 to 30,690) fewer cycles, compared with 4445 (95% CI 3144 to 5749) fewer cycles in women over the age of 40 years. This equates to overall 25,143 (95% CI 22,408 to 27,877) fewer predicted live births from IVF, of which only 490 (95% CI 381 to 601) are anticipated to occur in women over the age of 40 years. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 recession could have a profound impact on US IVF live birth rates in young women, further aggravating pre-existing declines in total fertility rates.","Gromski, Piotr S; Smith, Andrew D A C; Lawlor, Deborah A; Sharara, Fady I; Nelson, Scott M",Reprod Biomed Online,,478
500232,Buprenorphine Use for Iatrogenic Withdrawal Syndromes Related to COVID 19,2020,"Background: The novel coronavirus (SARS CoV-2) has caused significant morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. However, the effects of diabetes control including insulin use remain uncertain in terms of clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective observational study, all adult patients admitted to Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, from March 1 through April 24, 2020 with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and diabetes were included. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data, insulin dose at home and at the hospital, other anti-hyperglycemic agents use, and outcomes were obtained. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the factors associated with diabetes control and mortality. Results: Patients who used insulin at home had higher mortality compared to those who did not (35% vs 18% p = .015), this was true even after adjustment for demographics, comorbidities and a1c OR 2.65 95% CI (1.23-5.71) p = .013. However, the mean a1c and the median home requirements of insulin did not significantly differ among patients who died compared to the ones that survived. Patients who died had significantly higher inpatient insulin requirements (highest day insulin requirement recorded in units during hospitalization) 36 (11-86) vs 21 (8-52) p = .043 despite similar baseline a1c and steroid doses received. After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities and a1c, peak insulin requirements remained significantly associated with inpatient mortality OR 1.022 95% CI (1.00-1.04) p = .044. Conclusion: Among diabetic patients infected with COVID-19, insulin therapy at home was significantly independently associated with increased mortality. Peak daily inpatient insulin requirements was also independently associated with increased inpatient mortality.","Riahi, Shayan; Sombra, Lorenna Rodrigues Silva; Lo, Kevin Bryan; Chacko, Shireen R; Neto, Alvaro Goncalves Mendes; Azmaiparashvili, Zurab; Patarroyo-Aponte, Gabriel; Rangaswami, Janani; Anastasopoulou, Catherine",Endocr Res,,478
500389,How should we implement radiotherapy for cancer patients in China during the endemic period of COVID-19?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Transplant recipients who develop COVID-19 may be at increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Determining the status of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in both candidates and recipients will be important to understand the epidemiology and clinical course of COVID-19 in this population. While there are multiple tests to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, their performance is variable. Tests vary according to their platforms and the antigenic targets which make interpretation of the results challenging. Furthermore, for some assays, sensitivity and specificity is less than optimal. Additionally, currently available serological tests do not exclude the possibility that positive responses are due to cross reactive antibodies to community coronaviruses rather than SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This study describes the development and validation of a high throughput multiplex antibody detection assay. RESULTS: The multiplex assay has the capacity to identify, simultaneously, patient responses to 5 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, namely, the full spike protein, 3 individual domains of the spike protein (S1, S2 and receptor binding domain) and the nucleocapsid protein. The antibody response to the above proteins are SARS-CoV-2 specific, as antibodies against 4 common coronaviruses do not cross-react. CONCLUSIONS: This new assay provides a novel tool to interrogate the spectrum of immune responses to SAR-CoV-2 and is uniquely suitable for use in the transplant setting. Test configuration is essentially identical to the single antigen bead assays used in the majority of histocompatibility laboratories around the world and could easily be implemented into routine screening of transplant candidates and recipients.","Bray, Robert A; Lee, Jar-How; Brescia, Peter; Kumar, Deepali; Nong, Thoa; Shih, Remi; Woodle, E Steve; Maltzman, Jonathan S; Gebel, Howard M",Transplantation,,478
500390,How should we implement radiotherapy for cancer patients in China during the endemic period of COVID-19?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic, with many patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomy is not recommended by current guidelines as it is considered a superspreading event owing to aerosolization that unduly risks health care workers. METHODS: Patients with severe COVID-19 who were on mechanical ventilation for 5 days or longer were evaluated for percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. We developed a novel percutaneous tracheostomy technique that placed the bronchoscope alongside the endotracheal tube, not inside it. That improved visualization during the procedure and continued standard mechanical ventilation after positioning the inflated endotracheal tube cuff in the distal trachea. This technique offers a significant mitigation for the risk of virus aerosolization during the procedure. RESULTS: From March 10 to April 15, 2020, 270 patients with COVID-19 required invasive mechanical ventilation at New York University Langone Health Manhattan's campus; of those, 98 patients underwent percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. The mean time from intubation to the procedure was 10.6 ± 5 days. Currently, 32 patients (33%) do not require mechanical ventilatory support, 19 (19%) have their tracheostomy tube downsized, and 8 (8%) were decannulated. Forty patients (41%) remain on full ventilator support, and 19 (19%) are weaning from mechanical ventilation. Seven patients (7%) died as a result of respiratory and multiorgan failure. Tracheostomy-related bleeding was the most common complication (5 patients). None of health care providers has had symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our percutaneous tracheostomy technique appears to be safe and effective for COVID-19 patients and safe for health care workers.","Angel, Luis; Kon, Zachary N; Chang, Stephanie H; Rafeq, Samaan; Palasamudram Shekar, Saketh; Mitzman, Brian; Amoroso, Nancy; Goldenberg, Ronald; Sureau, Kimberly; Smith, Deane E; Cerfolio, Robert J",Ann Thorac Surg,,478

For coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), wide variations in the CFR and doubling time have been noted among various countries. Early in the epidemic, CFR calculations involving all patients as denominator do not account for the hospitalised patients who are ill and will die in the future. Hence, we calculated cumulative CFR (cCFR) using only patients whose final clinical outcomes were known at a certain time point. We also estimated the daily average doubling time. Calculating CFR using this method leads to temporal stability in the fatality rates, the cCFR stabilises at different values for different countries. The possible reasons for this are an improved outcome rate by the end of the epidemic and a wider testing strategy. The United States, France, Turkey and China had high cCFR at the start due to low outcome rate. By 22 April, Germany, China and South Korea had a low cCFR. China and South Korea controlled the epidemic and achieved high doubling times. The doubling time in Russia did not cross 10 days during the study period.","Mazumder, A; Arora, M; Sra, M S; Gupta, A; Behera, P; Gupta, M; Agarwal, M; Rao, A; Mohanta, S S; Parameswaran, G G; Lohiya, A; Shewade, H D",Epidemiol Infect,,478

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the effectivity of a program of control and prevention of COVID-19 in an academic general hospital in Spain. METHODS: We captured the number of COVID-19 cases and the type of contact that occurred in hospitalized patients and healthcare personnel (HCP). To evaluate the impact of the continuous use of a surgical mask among HCP, the number of patients with COVID-19 HAIs and accumulated incidence of HCP with COVID-19 was compared between the preintervention and intervention periods. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-two patients with COVID-19 have been admitted to the hospital. Seven of them had an HAI origin (6 in the preintervention period and 1 in the intervention period). One hundred forty-two HCP were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Of them, 22 (15.5%) were attributed to healthcare (2 in the emergency department and none in the critical care departments), and 120 (84.5%) were attributed to social relations in the workplace or during their non-work-related personal interactions. The accumulated incidence during the preintervention period was 22.3 for every 1000 HCP and 8.2 for every 1000 HCP during the intervention period. The relative risk was 0.37 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.55) and the attributable risk was -0.014 (95% confidence interval, -0.020 to -0.009). CONCLUSIONS: A program of control and prevention of HAIs complemented with the recommendation for the continuous use of a surgical mask in the workplace and social environments of HCP effectively decreased the risk of COVID-19 HAIs in admitted patients and HCP.","Gras-Valentí, Paula; Mora-Muriel, Juan G; Chico-Sánchez, Pablo; Algado-Sellés, Natividad; Soler-Molina, Victor M; Hernández-Maldonado, María; Lameiras-Azevedo, Ana S; Jiménez Sepúlveda, Natali J; Gómez Sotero, Isel L; Villanueva-Ruiz, César O; Barrenengoa-Sañudo, Julio; Fuster-Pérez, Marina; Cánovas-Jávega, Sandra; Cerezo-Milan, Patricia; Monerris-Palmer, Miranda; Llorens-Soriano, Pere; Merino-Lucas, Esperanza; Rodríguez-Diaz, Juan C; Gil-Carbonell, Joan; Sánchez-Martínez, Rosario; Pastor-Cesteros, Rogelio; Mena-Esquivias, Luis; Galiana-Ivars, Maria; Jaime-Sánchez, Francisco A; Margarit-Ferri, Cesar; Gonzalez-deDios, Javier; Lloret, German; García-Alonso, Miguel A; Sánchez-Vela, Pablo; Sánchez-Payá, José",J. patient saf,,478

Since an endoscopy unit and its staff are at potentially high risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we conducted a survey for the management of the gastrointestinal endoscopic practice, personal protective equipment (PPE), and risk assessment for COVID-19 during the pandemic at multiple facilities.Methods. The 11-item survey questionnaire was sent to representative respondent of Department of Gastroenterology, Osaka City University Hospital, and its 19 related facilities.Results. A total of 18 facilities submitted valid responses and a total of 373 health care professionals (HCPs) participated. All facilities (18/18: 100%) were screening patients at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection before endoscopy. During the pandemic, we found that the total volume of endoscopic procedures decreased by 44%. Eleven facilities (11/18: 61%) followed recommendations of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society (JGES); consequently, about 35%-50% of esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were canceled. Mask (surgical mask or N95 mask), face shield/goggle, gloves (one or two sets), and gown (with long or short sleeves) were being used by endoscopists, nurses, endoscopy technicians, and endoscope cleaning staff in all the facilities (18/18: 100%). SARS-CoV-2 infection risk assessment of HCPs was conducted daily in all the facilities (18/18: 100%), resulting in no subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCPs.Conclusion.

504682,The Right Ventricle: A Target in COVID-19 Cardiac Insult,2020,": Background: Annually, approximately 10 million pilgrims travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for Umrah from more than 180 countries. This event presents major challenges for the Kingdom's public health sector, which strives to decrease the burden of infectious diseases and to adequately control their spread both in KSA and pilgrims home nations. The aims of the study were to assess preventative measures practice, including vaccination history and health education, among Umrah pilgrims in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross sectional survey was administered to pilgrims from February to April 2019 at the departure lounge at King Abdul Aziz International airport, Jeddah city. The questionnaire comprised questions on sociodemographic information (age, gender, marital status, level of education, history of vaccinations and chronic illnesses), whether the pilgrim had received any health education and orientation prior to coming to Saudi Arabia or on their arrival, and their experiences with preventative practices. Results: Pilgrims (n = 1012) of 41 nationalities completed the survey. Chronic diseases were reported among pilgrims (n = 387, 38.2%) with cardiovascular diseases being the most reported morbidity (n = 164, 42.3%). The majority of pilgrims had been immunized prior to travel to Saudi Arabia (n = 770, 76%). The most commonly reported immunizations were influenza (n = 514, 51%), meningitis (n = 418, 41%), and Hepatitis B virus vaccinations (n = 310, 31%). However, 242 (24%) had not received any vaccinations prior to travel, including meningitis vaccine and poliomyelitis vaccine, which are mandatory by Saudi Arabian health authorities for pilgrims coming from polio active countries. Nearly a third of pilgrims (n = 305; 30.1%) never wore a face mask in crowded areas during Umrah in 2019. In contrast, similar numbers said they always wore a face mask (n = 351, 34.6%) in crowded areas, while 63.2% reported lack of availability of face masks during Umrah. The majority of participants had received some form of health education on preventative measures, including hygiene aspects (n = 799, 78.9%), mostly in their home countries (n = 450, 44.4%). A positive association was found between receiving health education and practicing of preventative measures, such as wearing face masks in crowded areas (p = 0.04), and other health practice scores (p = 0.02). Conclusion: Although the experiences of the preventative measures among pilgrims in terms of health education, vaccinations, and hygienic practices were at times positive, this study identified several issues. These included the following preventative measures: immunizations, particularly meningitis and poliomyelitis vaccine, and using face masks in crowded areas. The recent COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for further studies that focus on development of accessible health education in a form that engages pilgrims to promote comprehensive preventative measures during Umrah and Hajj and other religious pilgrimages.","Tobaiqy, Mansour; Alhasan, Ahmed H; Shams, Manal M; Amer, Samar A; MacLure, Katie; Alcattan, Mohammed F; Almudarra, Sami S",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,478

While environmentally relevant microbes often are not amenable to genetic manipulation or cannot be cultivated in the laboratory, extensive metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets for these organisms might be available. Hence, dedicated workflows for specific analyses are needed to fully benefit from this information. Here, we identified abundant sRNAs from oceanic environmental populations of the ecologically important primary producer Prochlorococcus starting from a metatranscriptomic differential RNA-Seq (mdRNA-Seq) dataset. We tracked their homologs in laboratory isolates, and we provide a framework for their further detailed characterization. Several of the experimentally validated sRNAs responded to ecologically relevant changes in cultivation conditions. The expression of the here newly discovered sRNA Yfr28 was highly stimulated in low-nitrogen conditions. Its predicted top targets include mRNAs encoding cell division proteins, a sigma factor, and several enzymes and transporters, suggesting a pivotal role of Yfr28 in the coordination of primary metabolism and cell division. A cis-encoded antisense RNA was identified as a possible positive regulator of atpF encoding subunit b' of the ATP synthase complex. The presented workflow will also be useful for other environmentally relevant microorganisms for which experimental validation abilities are frequently limiting although there is wealth of sequence information available.","Lott, Steffen C; Voigt, Karsten; Lambrecht, S Joke; Hess, Wolfgang R; Steglich, Claudia",,,478

505843,"COVID-19, impact on myeloma patients",2020,"OBJECTIVE: To explore if newborns in the second pregnancy following a previous caesarean delivery (CD) have higher risk of perinatal mortality or cerebral palsy than newborns in pregnancies following a previous vaginal delivery (VD). DESIGN: Cohort study with information from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway and the Cerebral Palsy Registry of Norway. SETTING: Births in Norway. PARTICIPANTS: 294 598 women with their first and second singleton delivery during 1996-2015. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stillbirth, perinatal mortality, neonatal mortality and cerebral palsy. RESULTS: Among 294 598 included women, 42 962 (15%) had a CD in their first pregnancy while 251 636 (85%) had a VD. Compared with the second delivery of mothers with a previous VD, the adjusted OR (adjOR), for stillbirth in the second pregnancy following a previous CD was 1.45, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.73; for perinatal death the adjOR was 1.42 (1.22 to 1.73) and for neonatal death 1.13 (0.86 to 1.49). Among children who survived the neonatal period, the adjOR for cerebral palsy was 1.27 (0.99 to 1.64). Secondary outcomes, including small for gestational age, preterm and very preterm birth, uterine rupture and placental complications (eg, postpartum haemorrhage and pre-eclampsia) were more frequent in the subsequent pregnancy following a previous CD compared with a previous VD, in particular for uterine rupture adjOR 86.7 (48.2 to 156.1). Adjustment for potential confounders attenuated the ORs somewhat, but the excess risk in the second pregnancy persisted for all outcomes. CONCLUSION: A previous CD was in this study associated with increased risk for stillbirth and perinatal death compared with a previous VD. Although less robust, we also found that a previous CD was associated with a slightly increased risk of cerebral palsy among children surviving the neonatal period. The aetiology behind these associations needs further investigation.","Bjellmo, Solveig; Andersen, Guro L; Hjelle, Sissel; Klungsøyr, Kari; Krebs, Lone; Lydersen, Stian; Romundstad, Pål Richard; Vik, Torstein",BMJ Open,,478

Their organization during the outbreak period aims to ensure continuity of care while limiting the risk of death from COVID-19. In the radiotherapy department of Mulhouse hospital (France), we pointed five points out: protection of medical and paramedical staff, protection of patients undergoing treatment, detection of patients suspected of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 and their management, reorganization of the patient circuit and measures regarding the quality management. This reflection, which began at the beginning of the outbreak in our city, allows us to preserve the access to radiotherapy treatments by anticipating the risk of spreading the virus. Through biweekly meetings, we continue to adapt to the epidemic in our department, considering our material resources. The ability to perform diagnostic tests in all suspect patients would also allow us to refine our procedures.","Ohnleiter, T; Piot, L; Rogenmuser, A; Noirclerc, M; Hamlaoui, R; Grandgirard, A",Cancer Radiother,,478
507850,Safety of Esophageal Cancer Surgery During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Europe: A Multicenter Study,2021,"This paper introduces a paradigm of smartphone application based disease diagnostics that may completely revolutionise the way healthcare services are being provided. Although primarily aimed to assist the problems in rendering the healthcare services during the coronavirus pandemic, the model can also be extended to identify the exact disease that the patient is caught with from a broad spectrum of pulmonary diseases. The app inputs Chest X-Ray images captured from the mobile camera which is then relayed to the AI architecture in a cloud platform, and diagnoses the disease with state of the art accuracy. Doctors with a smartphone can leverage the application to save the considerable time that standard COVID-19 tests take for preliminary diagnosis. The scarcity of training data and class imbalance issues were effectively tackled in our approach by the use of Data Augmentation Generative Adversarial Network (DAGAN) and model architecture based as a Convolutional Siamese Network with attention mechanism. The backend model was tested for robustness us-ing publicly available datasets under two different classification scenarios(Binary/Multiclass) with minimal and noisy data. The model achieved pinnacle testing accuracy of 99.30% and 98.40% on the two respective scenarios, making it completely reliable for its users. On top of that a semi-live training scenario was introduced, which helps improve the app performance over time as data accumulates. Overall, the problems of generalisability of complex models and data inefficiency is tackled through the model architecture. The app based setting with semi live training helps in ease of access to reliable healthcare in the society, as well as help ineffective research of rare diseases in a minimal data setting.","Shalu, Hrithwik; Harikrishnan, P; Das, Akash; Mandal, Megdut; Sali, Harshavardhan M; Kadiwala, Juned",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08912v1.pdf,478

Characterization of the aerosol and bioaerosol was carried out to estimate the personal exposure to aerosol concentrations, as well as particle size distributions, and to give an indication of the native microbial load.The data obtained showed a predominance of particles with a diameter greater than 8 µm, associated with low ability of penetration in the human respiratory system. A low microbial load was also observed, with a prevalence of noncultivable strains generated by the aerosolization of the thermal waters.Finally, the estimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk by means of mathematical modeling revealed a low risk of transmission, with a decisive effect given by the mechanical ventilation system, which together with the adoption of social distancing measures makes the risk of infection extremely low.","Scungio, Mauro; Crognale, Silvia; Lelli, Davide; Carota, Eleonora; Calabrò, Giuseppe",,,478

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is mostly by respiratory droplets and direct contact but viral RNA fragments have also been detected in the faecal waste of patients with COVID-19. Cleanliness and effective sanitation of public toilets is a concern, as flushing the toilet is potentially an aerosol generating procedure. When the toilets are of the squatting type and without a cover, there exists a risk of viral contamination through the splashing of toilet water and aerosol generation. Objective: This study aims to determine whether the cleanliness of public toilets was a concern to the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether a squatting toilet was preferred to a seated design. Methods: A questionnaire was designed and posted on ""WeChat""contact groups of the investigators. Results: The survey showed that 91% of participants preferred squatting toilets, but that 72% were apprehensive of personal contamination when using public toilets. Over 63% of the respondents had encountered an incidence of water splash and would prefer public toilets to be covered during flushing and 83% of these respondents preferred a foot-controlled device. Conclusion: This survey suggests that consideration should be given to the installation of a simple foot-controlled device to cover public squatting toilets to help restrict potential COVID-19 contamination and to meet hygienic expectations of the public. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if lung ultrasound (LUS) may provide valuable prognostic information in adult patients suspected of COVID-19. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of adult patients in an ED was conducted. LUS was performed within one hour of the patients' arrival; COVID-19 was defined by a respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA positive test. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients suspected of COVID-19 and normal LUS with critical outcomes during follow-up, defined as one or more of the following: need of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), invasive mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay or death. Follow-up was 14 days. RESULTS: A total of 83 patients were included between 9 March and 12 April 2020. In all, 47 (57%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 45.3-67.5%) had a normal LUS, 46 (98%; 95% CI: 88.7-99.9%) of whom had no critical outcomes. A total of 36 (43%; 95% CI: 32.5-54.7%) had an abnormal LUS, eight of whom (22%; 95% CI: 10.1-39.2%) had critical outcomes. Nine (11%; 95%: CI 5.1-19.6%) had one or more critical outcomes: three on NIV, five in ICUs, four on invasive mechanical ventilation and two died. Among the 12 patients (14%; 95% CI: 7.7-23.9%) tested positive for COVID-19, 11 (92%; 95% CI: 61.5-99.8%) had an abnormal LUS. CONCLUSIONS: Among adult ED patients suspected of COVID-19, a normal LUS is associated with a low risk of critical outcomes.

The option of school closure, SARS-CoV-2 initially being poorly known, was influenced by the epidemiological aspects of the influenza virus. However, school closure is still under debate and seems unsupported by sure evidence of efficacy in the COVID-19 era. The aim of our narrative review is to discuss the available literature on SARS-CoV-2 spread among children and adolescents, in the school setting, trying to explain why children appear less susceptible to severe disease and less involved in viral spreading. We also tried to define the efficacy of school closure, through an overview of the effects of the choices made by the various countries, trying to identify which preventive measures could be effective for a safe reopening. Finally, we focused on the psychological aspects of such a prolonged closure for children and adolescents. SARS-CoV-2, children, COVID-19, influenza, and school were used as key words in our literature research, updated to 29 March 2021.

Because race and ethnicity are missing for a proportion of reported COVID-19 cases, counties with substantial missing information often are excluded from analyses of disparities (4). Thus, as a complement to these case-based analyses, population-based studies can help direct public health interventions. Using data from the 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), CDC identified counties where five racial and ethnic minority groups (Hispanic or Latino [Hispanic], non-Hispanic Black or African American [Black], non-Hispanic Asian [Asian], non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native [AI/AN], and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander [NH/PI]) might have experienced high COVID-19 impact during April 1-December 22, 2020. These counties had high 2-week COVID-19 incidences (>100 new cases per 100,000 persons in the total population) and percentages of persons in five racial and ethnic groups that were larger than the national percentages (denoted as ""large""). During April 1-14, a total of 359 (11.4%) of 3,142 U.S. counties reported high COVID-19 incidence, including 28.7% of counties with large percentages of Asian persons and 27.9% of counties with large percentages of Black persons. During August 5-18, high COVID-19 incidence was reported by 2,034 (64.7%) counties, including 92.4% of counties with large percentages of Black persons and 74.5% of counties with large percentages of Hispanic persons. During December 9-22, high COVID-19 incidence was reported by 3,114 (99.1%) counties, including >95% of those with large percentages of persons in each of the five racial and ethnic minority groups. The findings of this population-based analysis complement those of case-based analyses. In jurisdictions with substantial missing race and ethnicity information, this method could be applied to smaller geographic areas, to identify communities of color that might be experiencing high potential COVID-19 impact. As areas with high rates of new infection change over time, public health efforts can be tailored to the needs of communities of color as the pandemic evolves and integrated with longer-term plans to improve health equity.","Lee, Florence C; Adams, Laura; Graves, Sierra J; Massetti, Greta M; Calanan, Renee M; Penman-Aguilar, Ana; Henley, S Jane; Annor, Francis B; Van Handel, Michelle; Aleshire, Noah; Durant, Tonji; Fuld, Jennifer; Griffing, Sean; Mattocks, Laura; Liburd, Leandris",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,478

Because of these children unique needs related to manage uncertainty and overcoming situations, an in-depth approach to how they navigated through quarantine urged to better comprehend their current support needs. Forty-seven families with a child with ASD ranging in age between 2 and 17 years old (M = 7.3, SD = 3.4) from the north of Spain responded to an online developed questionnaire on different aspects of their daily life management of quarantine. Most of the families stressed that their offspring better drove quarantine than expected. Some families reported that youth participated more often in families' routines and were more communicative with their parents. Families, beyond some difficulties aroused, had more time to qualitatively spend with their children to teach new skills as autonomy or house care related skills. Families also developed new strategies to manage quarantine, such as structuring their days, using visual supports or new technologies for learning or leisure, and found more useful in this effort their family cohesion, online contact with relatives, and having online psychological supports.","Mumbardó-Adam, Cristina; Barnet-López, Silvia; Balboni, Giulia",Res Dev Disabil,,478

The clinical course of the disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranges from mild respiratory symptoms to severe lung failure. The virus is currently rapidly spreading around the world and pushing health systems to the limits of their capacity due to the exponential increase in the number of cases. The origin of SARS-CoV­2 lies in the bat coronavirus pool and has now emerged in the human population due to interspecies transmission. Molecular diagnostic methods have been established in a very short time and a number of clinical studies on the effectiveness of different antiviral drugs are ongoing. The development of a vaccine using different approaches is also under investigation.Considering the high number of cases and mortality rates of up to 9% there is an urgent need for action. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge on human coronaviruses with a strong focus on the current data on SARS-CoV­2.

So far, more than 30 million people have been infected and nearly one million have died. Although the world is still in the stage of COVID-19 pandemic, the treatment of new cases and critically ill patients is the focus of the current work. However, COVID-19 patients lead to pulmonary fibrosis, such a serious threat to the prognosis of complications were also worthy of our attention. First of all, we proposed the possible mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis caused by SARS-CoV-2, based on the published data of COVID-19 ((i) Direct evidence: pulmonary fibrosis was found in autopsy and pulmonary puncture pathology. (ii) Indirect evidence: increased levels of fibrosis-related cytokines[transforming growth factor [TGF]- ß, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]- &#945;, interleukin [IL]-6, etc] in peripheral blood of severe patients.) What is more, we summarized the role of three fibrosis-related signaling pathways (TGF- ß signal pathway, WNT signal pathway and YAP/TAZ signal pathway) in pulmonary fibrosis. Finally, we suggested the therapeutic value of two drugs (pirfenidone and nintedanib) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19-induced pulmonary fibrosis.","Zhang, Chi; Wu, Zhao; Li, Jia-Wen; Tan, Kangan; Yang, Wanna; Zhao, Hong; Wang, Gui-Qiang",J Med Virol,,478
518989,"Preoperative Frailty Assessment, Operative Severity Score, and Early Postoperative Loss of Independence in Surgical Patients Age 65 Years or Older",2020,"Multiple candidate vaccines to prevent COVID-19 have entered large-scale phase 3 placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials, and several have demonstrated substantial short-term efficacy. At some point after demonstration of substantial efficacy, placebo recipients should be offered the efficacious vaccine from their trial, which will occur before longer-term efficacy and safety are known. The absence of a placebo group could compromise assessment of longer-term vaccine effects. However, by continuing follow-up after vaccination of the placebo group, this study shows that placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy can be mathematically derived by assuming that the benefit of vaccination over time has the same profile for the original vaccine recipients and the original placebo recipients after their vaccination. Although this derivation provides less precise estimates than would be obtained by a standard trial where the placebo group remains unvaccinated, this proposed approach allows estimation of longer-term effect, including durability of vaccine efficacy and whether the vaccine eventually becomes harmful for some. Deferred vaccination, if done open-label, may lead to riskier behavior in the unblinded original vaccine group, confounding estimates of long-term vaccine efficacy. Hence, deferred vaccination via blinded crossover, where the vaccine group receives placebo and vice versa, would be the preferred way to assess vaccine durability and potential delayed harm. Deferred vaccination allows placebo recipients timely access to the vaccine when it would no longer be proper to maintain them on placebo, yet still allows important insights about immunologic and clinical effectiveness over time.","Follmann, Dean; Fintzi, Jonathan; Fay, Michael P; Janes, Holly E; Baden, Lindsey R; El Sahly, Hana M; Fleming, Thomas R; Mehrotra, Devan V; Carpp, Lindsay N; Juraska, Michal; Benkeser, David; Donnell, Deborah; Fong, Youyi; Han, Shu; Hirsch, Ian; Huang, Ying; Huang, Yunda; Hyrien, Ollivier; Luedtke, Alex; Carone, Marco; Nason, Martha; Vandebosch, An; Zhou, Honghong; Cho, Iksung; Gabriel, Erin; Kublin, James G; Cohen, Myron S; Corey, Lawrence; Gilbert, Peter B; Neuzil, Kathleen M",Ann. intern. med,,478

Initial epidiemiology showed that the majority of cases were in returned travellers from overseas. One aspect of Public Health response was to introduce compulsory 14 day quarantine for all travellers returning to New South Wales (NSW) by air or sea in Special Health Accommodation (SHA). We aim to outline the establishment of a specialised health quarantine accommodation service in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and describe the first month of COVID-19 screening. METHODS: The SHA was established with a comprehensive governance structure, remote clinical management through Royal Prince Alfred Virtual Hospital (rpavirtual) and site management with health care workers, NSW Police and accommodation staff. RESULTS: From 29 March to 29 April 2020, 373 returning travellers were admitted to the SHA from Sydney Airport. 88 (26.1%) of those swabbed were positive for SARS-CoV 2. The day of diagnosis of COVID-19 varied from Day 1 to Day 13, with 63.6% (n = 56) of these in the first week of quarantine. 50% of the people in the SHA were referred to rpavirtual for ongoing clinical management. Seven people required admission to hospital for ongoing clinical care. CONCLUSION: The Public Health response to COVID-19 in Australia included early and increased case detection through testing, tracing of contacts of confirmed cases, social distancing and prohibition of gatherings. In addition to these measures, the introduction of mandated quarantine for travellers to Australia was integral to the successful containment of COVID-19 in NSW and Australia through the prevention of transmission locally and interstate from returning travellers.","Fotheringham, Penelope; Anderson, Teresa; Shaw, Miranda; Jewitt, Joseph; Storey, Hannah; Hutchings, Owen; Cartwright, Jason; Gupta, Leena",BMC Public Health,,478

To better understand what is happening and to provide public health policy planners and clinicians timely information, we have searched and reviewed published studies about discharged patients testing positive again for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our search found 12 reports, all of which described patients in China. Our review of these reports indicates the presence of discharged patients who remain asymptomatic but test positive. However, it is unclear whether they are contagious because a positive reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) test does not necessarily indicate the presence of replicating and transmissible virus. Our review suggests the need for timely, parallel testing of different samples, including, for example, fecal specimens, from COVID-19 patients before and after they are discharged from hospitals.","Han, Zhiyong; Battaglia, Fortunato; Terlecky, Stanley R",J. med. virol,,478

The serum IgA was tested with chemiluminescence method. Autoregressive moving average model was used to extrapolate the IgA levels before hospital admission. The positive rate of IgA and IgG in our cohort was 97% and 79.0%, respectively. In this study, the IgA levels peaks within 10-15 days after admission, while the IgG levels peaks at admission. We found that the time difference between their peaks was about 10 days. Viral RNA detection results showed that the positive rate in sputum and feces were the highest. Blood gas analysis showed that deterioration of hypoxia with the enlargement of pulmonary exudation area. And alveolar-arterial oxygen difference and oxygenation index were correlated with IgA and IgG. The results of biopsy showed that the epithelium of lung was exfoliated and the mucosa was edematous. In severe COVID-19 patients, the combination of IgA and IgG can predict the progress of pulmonary lesions and is closely related to hypoxemia and both also play an important defense role in invasion and destruction of bronchial and alveolar epithelium by SARS-CoV-2.","Xue, Mingshan; Zhang, Teng; Hu, Haisheng; Huang, Zhifeng; Zhen, Yingjie; Liang, Yueting; Zeng, Yifeng; Jin, Tengchuan; Zhou, Luqian; Zhang, Xiaohua D; Sun, Baoqing",J Med Virol,,478

Here, we present a strategy for triggering short-term shelter-in-place orders when hospital admissions surpass a threshold. We use stochastic optimization to derive triggers that ensure hospital surges will not exceed local capacity and lockdowns are as short as possible. For example, Austin, Texas-the fastest-growing large city in the United States-has adopted a COVID-19 response strategy based on this method. Assuming that the relaxation of social distancing increases the risk of infection sixfold, the optimal strategy will trigger a total of 135 d (90% prediction interval: 126 d to 141 d) of sheltering, allow schools to open in the fall, and result in an expected 2,929 deaths (90% prediction interval: 2,837 to 3,026) by September 2021, which is 29% of the annual mortality rate. In the months ahead, policy makers are likely to face difficult choices, and the extent of public restraint and cocooning of vulnerable populations may save or cost thousands of lives.","Duque, Daniel; Morton, David P; Singh, Bismark; Du, Zhanwei; Pasco, Remy; Meyers, Lauren Ancel",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,478

Kefir and its probiotic contents can modulate the immune system to suppress infections from viruses (e.g., Zika, hepatitis C, influenza, rotaviruses). The antiviral mechanisms of kefir involve enhancement of macrophage production, increasing phagocytosis, boosting production of cluster of differentiation-positive (CD4+), CD8+, immunoglobulin (Ig)G+ and IgA+ B cells, T cells, neutrophils, as well as cytokines (e.g., interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, interferon gamma-Î³). Kefir can act as an anti-inflammatory agent by reducing expression of IL-6, IL-1, TNF-&#945;, and interferon-Î³. Hence, kefir might be a significant inhibitor of the 'cytokine storm' that contributes to COVID-19. Here, we review several studies with a particular emphasis on the effect of kefir consumption and their microbial composition against viral infection, as well as discussing the further development of kefir as a protective supplementary dietary against SARS-CoV-2 infection via modulating the immune response.","Hamida, Reham Samir; Shami, Ashwag; Ali, Mohamed Abdelaal; Almohawes, Zakiah Nasser; Mohammed, Afrah E; Bin-Meferij, Mashael Mohammed",Biomed Pharmacother,,478
524033,Rapid Adoption of an Interdisciplinary Care Team Model for Surgical Residents Managing Coronavirus Disease-19,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed unprecedented challenges for nations worldwide, among which medication shortages can cause a devastatingly negative impact on global health. Using Taiwan as an example, this report describes the sources of potential medication shortages, discusses the preparedness and contingency strategies to address medication shortages, and outlines the evidence-based recommendations on ensuring a stable medication supply and improving the quality and security of medicines. Many drug shortages have focused on shortfalls of overseas manufacturing, but the effect of the COVID-19 crisis on misallocation of medications within the nation's internal supply chains is also a great concern. A wide range of stakeholders are involved in pharmaceutical supply chains, including government regulators, health care insurers, pharmaceutical companies, frontline physicians and pharmacists, patients and families, professional and patient associations or unions, and even individuals who acquire medications from abroad. Collaborative inputs and efforts from all these interdependent stakeholders are critical for establishing transparent preparedness and contingency plans to address drug shortages affected by disruptions of overseas manufacturing or stockouts in pharmacies owing to medication misallocation. Strategies have been documented and recommended in Taiwan and the United States to mitigate drug shortages and ensure the long-term quality and security of medicines. Barriers to accessing medicines are nothing new, but the COVID-19 pandemic poses urgent and even novel challenges to the stability and integrity of medication supply, which urges for a need to reconsider and reinforce effective management strategies for pharmaceuticals. Active management, transparent information, and timely communications are essential to ensure a stable supply of key therapeutic medications, especially during a pandemic.","Kuo, Shihchen; Ou, Huang-Tz; Wang, C Jason",,,478

524085,The role of percutaneous interventions in the management of lung cancer patients during the Covid-19 pandemic,2020,"The parasitizing stage (trophozoite) of the protozoan parasite Perkinsus olseni progresses to the dormant stage (prezoosporangium) immediately after the death of the host through physiologically and morphologically drastic changes. This development is reproducible in Ray's fluid thioglycollate medium (RFTM). In this study, supplementation with tissue extract from a host, the Manila clam, significantly improved the efficiency of development, as determined by the numbers and sizes of developed prezoosporangia. Similar results were seen following supplementation with boiled host tissue extract, which indicates that a thermally stable component of the host is required for the parasite's development. Subsequently, we found that a commercially available lipid concentrate significantly increased prezoosporulation without host tissue, suggesting that the lipids in host tissue enhance prezoosporangia development. Moreover, we determined that yeast extract, sodium thioglycolate, and sodium chloride were the only components of RFTM required for prezoosporulation. Based on these findings, we prepared a simple, host-free medium for P. olseni prezoosporulation-Lipid concentrate Yeast extract Medium (LpcYM)-consisting of yeast extract, lipid concentrate, sodium thioglycolate, and sodium chloride. We confirmed that the prezoosporangia developed in LpcYM produce zoospores that are infectious to Manila clams and that trophozoites of other Perkinsus species (P. marinus, P. honshuensis, and P. chesapeaki) also develop to prezoosporangia in this host-free medium. As LpcYM has the simplest composition of prezoosporulation media available thus far, it enables us to conduct molecular and biochemical studies examining the drastic transformation process of this parasite.","Maeda, Kazuki; Yoshinaga, Tomoyoshi; Itoh, Naoki",Parasitol Int,,478
524262,Quantification of Aerosol Particle Concentrations During Endoscopic Sinonasal Surgery in the Operating Room,2020,"We present some ideas on how to extend a kinetic type model for crowd dynamics to account for an infectious disease spreading. We focus on a medium size crowd occupying a confined environment where the disease is easily spread. The kinetic theory approach we choose uses tools of game theory to model the interactions of a person with the surrounding people and the environment and it features a parameter to represent the level of stress. It is known that people choose different walking strategies when subjected to fear or stressful situations. To demonstrate that our model for crowd dynamics could be used to reproduce realistic scenarios, we simulate passengers in one terminal of Hobby Airport in Houston. In order to model disease spreading in a walking crowd, we introduce a variable that denotes the level of exposure to people spreading the disease. In addition, we introduce a parameter that describes the contagion interaction strength and a kernel function that is a decreasing function of the distance between a person and a spreading individual. We test our contagion model on a problem involving a small crowd walking through a corridor.","Kim, Daewa; Quaini, Annalisa",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15151v2.pdf,478

DESIGN: Nationwide mortality registries. SETTING: 605 urban districts and rural counties in China’s nationally representative Disease Surveillance Point (DSP) system. PARTICIPANTS: More than 300 million people of all ages. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Observed overall and weekly mortality rates from all cause and cause specific diseases for three months (1 January to 31 March 2020) of the covid-19 outbreak compared with the predicted (or mean rates for 2015-19) in different areas to yield rate ratio. RESULTS: The DSP system recorded 580 819 deaths from January to March 2020. In Wuhan DSP districts (n=3), the observed total mortality rate was 56% (rate ratio 1.56, 95% confidence interval 1.33 to 1.87) higher than the predicted rate (1147 v 735 per 100 000), chiefly as a result of an eightfold increase in deaths from pneumonia (n=1682; 275 v 33 per 100 000; 8.32, 5.19 to 17.02), mainly covid-19 related, but a more modest increase in deaths from certain other diseases, including cardiovascular disease (n=2347; 408 v 316 per 100 000; 1.29, 1.05 to 1.65) and diabetes (n=262; 46 v 25 per 100 000; 1.83, 1.08 to 4.37). In Wuhan city (n=13 districts), 5954 additional (4573 pneumonia) deaths occurred in 2020 compared with 2019, with excess risks greater in central than in suburban districts (50% v 15%). In other parts of Hubei province (n=19 DSP areas), the observed mortality rates from pneumonia and chronic respiratory diseases were non-significantly 28% and 23% lower than the predicted rates, despite excess deaths from covid-19 related pneumonia. Outside Hubei (n=583 DSP areas), the observed total mortality rate was non-significantly lower than the predicted rate (675 v 715 per 100 000), with significantly lower death rates from pneumonia (0.53, 0.46 to 0.63), chronic respiratory diseases (0.82, 0.71 to 0.96), and road traffic incidents (0.77, 0.68 to 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Except in Wuhan, no increase in overall mortality was found during the three months of the covid-19 outbreak in other parts of China. The lower death rates from certain non-covid-19 related diseases might be attributable to the associated behaviour changes during lockdown.","Liu, Jiangmei; Zhang, Lan; Yan, Yaqiong; Zhou, Yuchang; Yin, Peng; Qi, Jinlei; Wang, Lijun; Pan, Jingju; You, Jinling; Yang, Jing; Zhao, Zhenping; Wang, Wei; Liu, Yunning; Lin, Lin; Wu, Jing; Li, Xinhua; Chen, Zhengming; Zhou, Maigeng",BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33627311/,478
590813,The MERS-CoV receptor gene is among COVID-19 risk factors inherited from Neandertals,2020-12-12,"CyberTech has drawn academic attention in the aftermath of the global financial crisis (GFC) as banks were forced to embrace CyberTech more aggressively to cope with market competition after the crisis. Banks can improve their operational efficiency and quality of service by relying on CyberTech, but they become more vulnerable to cybersecurity. Thus, increasing investment in CyberTech becomes a strategic necessity for banks to combat cybersecurity hazards. The study investigates how disruptive digital transformation affects bank stability. In particular, it examines whether the law of diminishing marginal returns from overspending on CyberTech affects bank stability. Based on a global sample from 43 countries, we find that an increase in CyberTech spending above the threshold level adversely affects the stability of banks. The main reason behind the adverse effect of CyberTech spending on the stability of banks is that banks take more than the proportional risk for every dollar they spend on disruptive CyberTech after they cross a threshold level of spending. While results persist across sub-samples, our results indicate two important channels of technological regimes – a diminishing returns regime and an increasing returns regime. The diminishing returns regime improves bank stability through more aggressive spending on technology, and the increasing returns regime makes banks more unstable due to excess spending on disruptive CyberTech. The study has implications for cybersecurity and sustainable CyberTech spending for banks.","Uddin, Md Hamid; Mollah, Sabur; Ali, Md Hakim",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521920302313?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1057521920302313,478

OBJECTIVE To investigate the role of several adjuvant treatments in preventing severe pneumonia in patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 564 consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha Public Health Treatment Center, First Hospital of Yueyang, Junshan People's Hospital of Yueyang, Central Hospital of Shaoyang, Central Hospital of Xiangtan, Second Hospital of Changde, Central Hospital of Loudi, and First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China in Hunan province from January 17, 2020 to February 28, 2020; The final date of follow-up was March 15, 2020. EXPOSURES Nonspecific antivirals (arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon α), antihypertensives, and chloroquine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia; Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Of 564 patients, the median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-58 years), and 284 (50.4%) patients were men. Sixty-nine patients (12.2%) developed severe pneumonia. Patients who developed severe pneumonia were older (median age of 59 and 45 years, respectively), and more patients had comorbidities including hypertension (30.4% and 12.3%, respectively), diabetes (17.4% and 6.7%, respectively), and cardiovascular disease (8.7% and 3.2%, respectively) and presented with fever (84.1% and 60.4%, respectively) and shortness of breath (10.1% and 3.8%, respectively) compared with those who did not. Nonspecific antiviral therapy did not prevent clinical progression to severe pneumonia, although fewer hypertensive patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) therapy developed severe pneumonia in contrast with those on non-ACEI/ARB antihypertensive therapy (1 of 16 [6.3%] patients and 16 of 49 [32.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 26.4%; 95% CI, 1.5% to 41.3%]). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension without receiving ACEI/ARB therapy was an independent risk factor (odds ratio [OR], 2.07; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.00) for developing severe pneumonia irrespective of age. Besides, none of patients treated with chloroquine developed severe pneumonia, though without significance (difference, 12.0%; 95% CI, -3.5% to 30.0%) by propensity score matching. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Hypertensive patients on ACEI or ARB may be protective from severe pneumonia in COVID-19 and hence these therapies should not be ceased unless there is a strong indication or further epidemiological evidence. Though none of the current antiviral and immunoregulation therapy showed benefit in preventing COVID-19 progression, chloroquine deserved further investigation.","Feng, Zhichao; Li, Jennifer; Yao, Shanhu; Yu, Qizhi; Zhou, Wenming; Mao, Xiaowen; Li, Huiling; Kang, Wendi; Ouyang, Xin; Mei, Ji; Zeng, Qiuhua; Liu, Jincai; Ma, Xiaoqian; Rong, Pengfei; Wang, Wei",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057539,478

Personality was assessed in January/February 2020 when the public was not aware of the spread of coronavirus in the USA. Participants were reassessed in late March 2020 with four sets of questions about the pandemic: concerns, precautions, preparatory behaviours, and duration estimates. The sample consisted of N = 2066 participants (mean age = 51.42; range = 18–98; 48.5% women). Regression models were used to analyse the data with age, gender, education, race, and ethnicity as covariates. Consistent with the preregistered hypotheses, higher neuroticism was related to more concerns and longer duration estimates related to COVID‐19, higher extraversion was related to shorter duration estimates, and higher conscientiousness was associated with more precautions. In contrast to the preregistered hypotheses, higher neuroticism was associated with fewer precautions and unrelated to preparatory behaviours. Age moderated several trait–response associations, suggesting that some of the responses were associated more strongly in older adults, a group at risk for complications of COVID‐19. For example, older adults high in conscientiousness prepared more.

Despite phone triage's prevalence, few residency programs have designated curricula for residents to learn this vital skill. METHODS: We designed a phone triage curriculum initially piloted with senior residents at one of our continuity clinics. The curriculum consisted of a didactic session, a just-in-time simulation training session, and an experiential component of being on call during the ambulatory rotation. Retrospective pre-post self-assessments evaluated resident perceptions of their skills in taking histories and triaging care over the phone in addition to obtaining qualitative feedback from faculty and residents immediately after the curriculum and 1–2 years postgraduation. RESULTS: Of 11 eligible residents, 10 (91%) chose to participate in the pilot curriculum. Residents reported that their skills in history taking over the phone improved from 20% to 90% and their ability to triage patients over the phone improved from 0% to 80%. This led to a quality improvement initiative to increase patient calls and has continued for 5 years, with continued positive feedback from residents and attendings. DISCUSSION: Phone triage skills are a necessity for pediatric providers, but few residency programs have training curricula in place. Through an experience-based phone triage program, residents significantly improved their self-reported skills at history taking and triaging. Similar curricula could easily be adopted at other institutions.","Roth, Lauren T.; Lane, Mariellen; Friedman, Suzanne",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,https://doi.org/10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10993; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33117885/,478

In comparison with adults, children present milder symptoms, with most having an asymptomatic course. We hypothesized that COVID-19 infection has a negative impact on the continuation of chemotherapy and increases nonrelapse mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was performed to assess the course of SARS-CoV-2 among children with hematological or oncological malignancies and its impact on cancer therapy. Records of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 155 children with malignancies from 14 Polish centers for pediatric hematology and oncology were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 replication was observed in 155 patients. Forty-nine patients were symptomatic, with the following being the most common manifestations: fever (31 patients), gastrointestinal symptoms (10), coryza (13), cough (13) and headache (8). In children who were retested, the median time of a positive PCR result was 16 days (range 1–70 days), but 12.7% of patients were positive beyond day + 20. The length of viral PCR positivity correlated with the absolute neutrophil count at diagnosis. Seventy-six patients did not undergo further SARS-CoV-2 testing and were considered convalescents after completion of isolation. Antibiotic therapy was administered in 15 children, remdesivir in 6, convalescent plasma in 4, oxygen therapy in 3 (1—mechanical ventilation), steroids in 2, intravenous immunoglobulins in 2, and heparin in 4. Eighty patients were treated with chemotherapy within 30 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis or were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection during 30 days of chemotherapy administration. Respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19 and associated with oxygen therapy were present in 4 patients in the study population, and four deaths were recorded (2 due to COVID-19 and 2 due to progressive malignancy). The probability of 100-day overall survival was 97.3% (95% CI 92.9–99%). Delay in the next chemotherapy cycle occurred in 91 of 156 cases, with a median of 14 days (range 2–105 days). CONCLUSIONS: For the majority of pediatric cancer patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection does not result in a severe, life-threatening course. Our data show that interruptions in therapy are common and can result in suboptimal therapy.

591829,Perspectives on the Future Development of Mobile Applications for Dermatology Clinical Research,2021-09-07,"SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is critical for virus infection via engagement of ACE2, and amino acid variation in Spike is increasingly appreciated. Given both vaccines and therapeutics are designed around Wuhan-1 Spike, this raises the theoretical possibility of virus escape, particularly in immunocompromised individuals where prolonged viral replication occurs. Here we report chronic SARS-CoV-2 with reduced sensitivity to neutralising antibodies in an immune suppressed individual treated with convalescent plasma, generating whole genome ultradeep sequences by both short and long read technologies over 23 time points spanning 101 days. Although little change was observed in the overall viral population structure following two courses of remdesivir over the first 57 days, N501Y in Spike was transiently detected at day 55 and V157L in RdRp emerged. However, following convalescent plasma we observed large, dynamic virus population shifts, with the emergence of a dominant viral strain bearing D796H in S2 and ΔH69/ΔV70 in the S1 N-terminal domain NTD of the Spike protein. As passively transferred serum antibodies diminished, viruses with the escape genotype diminished in frequency, before returning during a final, unsuccessful course of convalescent plasma. In vitro, the Spike escape double mutant bearing ΔH69/ΔV70 and D796H conferred decreased sensitivity to convalescent plasma, whilst maintaining infectivity similar to wild type. D796H appeared to be the main contributor to decreased susceptibility, but incurred an infectivity defect. The ΔH69/ΔV70 single mutant had two-fold higher infectivity compared to wild type and appeared to compensate for the reduced infectivity of D796H. Consistent with the observed mutations being outside the RBD, monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBD were not impacted by either or both mutations, but a non RBD binding monoclonal antibody was less potent against ΔH69/ΔV70 and the double mutant. These data reveal strong selection on SARS-CoV-2 during convalescent plasma therapy associated with emergence of viral variants with reduced susceptibility to neutralising antibodies.","Kemp, SA; Collier, DA; Datir, R; Ferreira, IATM; Gayed, S; Jahun, A; Hosmillo, M; Rees-Spear, C; Mlcochova, P; Lumb, Ines Ushiro; Roberts, David J; Chandra, Anita; Temperton, N; Sharrocks, K; Blane, E; Briggs, JAG; van, Gils MJ; Smith, KGC; Bradley, JR; Smith, C; Doffinger, R; Ceron-Gutierrez, L; Barcenas-Morales, G; Pollock, DD; Goldstein, RA; Smielewska, A; Skittrall, JP; Gouliouris, T; Goodfellow, IG; Gkrania-Klotsas, E; Illingworth, CJR; McCoy, LE; Gupta, RK",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.05.20241927v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398302/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.05.20241927,478

MATERIALS AND METHODS: SLE patients monitored by a single Italian centre were interviewed between February and July 2020. Patients were considered to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infections in case of 1) positive nasopharyngeal swab; 2) positive serology associated with COVID19 suggesting symptoms. The following data were also recorded: clinical symptoms, adoption of social distancing measures, disease activity and treatment discontinuation. RESULTS: 332 patients were enrolled in the study. Six patients (1.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the incidence being significantly higher in the subgroup of patients treated with biological Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (p = 0.005), while no difference was observed for other therapies, age at enrollment, disease duration, type of cumulative organ involvement or adoption of social isolation. The course of the disease was mild. Thirty-six patients (11.1%) discontinued at least part of their therapy during this time period, and 27 (8.1%) cases of disease flare were recorded. Correlation between flare and discontinuation of therapy was statistically significant (p<0.001). No significant increase of rate of flare in a subgroup of the same patients during 2020 was observed. CONCLUSION: Treatment discontinuation seems to be an important cause of disease flare. Our findings suggest that abrupt drug withdrawal should be avoided or evaluated with caution on the basis of individual infection risk and comorbidities.","Zucchi, Dina; Tani, Chiara; Elefante, Elena; Stagnaro, Chiara; Carli, Linda; Signorini, Viola; Ferro, Francesco; Trentin, Francesca; Fulvio, Giovanni; Cardelli, Chiara; Di Battista, Marco; Governato, Gianmaria; Figliomeni, Antonio; Mosca, Marta",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33439910/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245274,478

Their mission is to enter a host cell, to transfer the viral genome, and to replicate progeny whilst diverting cellular immunity. The role of ubiquitin is to regulate fundamental cellular processes such as endocytosis, protein degradation, and immune signaling. Many viruses including influenza A virus (IAV) usurp ubiquitination and ubiquitin-like modifications to establish infection. In this focused review, we discuss how ubiquitin and unanchored ubiquitin regulate IAV host cell entry, and how histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a cytoplasmic deacetylase with ubiquitin-binding activity, mediates IAV capsid uncoating. We also discuss the roles of ubiquitin in innate immunity and its implications in the IAV life cycle.","Rudnicka, Alina; Yamauchi, Yohei",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27783058/,478

For this purpose, we use more than 180,000 individuals from 51 countries in the most recent five waves (1990–2014) of the World Values Survey. We observe a significant tradeoff between life satisfaction, happiness and the Gini coefficient. Also, inequality is negatively associated with life satisfaction and happiness for lower-income groups as well as higher-income groups. Interestingly, our data also shows large scale embracement of inequality in self-reported attitudes as even almost half (49%) of the lower-income group support the statement that some inequality is necessary for sustaining individual effort. Perceived freedom, and perceived social mobility partially mediates the relationship between the Gini coefficient and subjective wellbeing indicators. Yet, there remains a substantial negative effect of inequality on subjective well-being. Nevertheless, when individuals’ perception of fairness is included, the effect of inequality disappears for both higher-income and lower-income groups. Overall, our findings suggest that people are bothered by inequality primarily due to fairness concerns.

Despite this, no study has been conducted among frontline community health workers in Africa, particularly in Ethiopia. The study aimed to determine the status of implementation of preventive measures of frontline community health care workers towards COVID-19 and its associated factors. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 421 health extension workers among selected districts. Data were collected using a pretested structured questionnaire adapted from different pieces of literature. Respondents who scored above mean score on the item measurement such as knowledge, attitude, and practice questions were categorized as knowledgeable, having positive attitude, and having good prevention practices, respectively. Data were entered in EpiData 3.1 and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0 software. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify significant predictors. P– values less than or equal to 0.05 were declared as statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean age of study participants was 31.35 years (±4.83 SD), and almost half (217; 51.54%) of respondents were single and 273 (62.47%) were trained for COVID-19 prevention measures. Of the total study subjects, 194 (46.08%; 95% CI=41.6–50.7%) had good prevention practices towards COVID-19. Being married (AOR=3.36, 95% CI=2.20–5.13), being trained (AOR=2.28, 95% CI=1.39–3.74), having good knowledge (AOR=2.4, 95% CI=1.52–3.99), and having positive attitude towards COVID-19 prevention measures (AOR=5.88, 95% CI=3.52–9.80) increase the likelihood of implementing prevention measures. CONCLUSION: This study showed that prevention status was low; therefore, government and non-governmental organizations working around the study area should emphasize providing training to increase their level of knowledge and to change the attitude towards implementation of prevention measures, and these can ultimately increase the status of prevention practices.","Gebremedhin, Tadesse; Abebe, Habtamu; Wondimu, Wondimagegn; Gizaw, Abraham Tamirat",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s327293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34434050/,478
594137,Understanding the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19: Its implication for therapeutic strategy,2020-12-06,"BACKGROUND: Biological changes underlying the sexual and reproductive maturation of school-age children are linked with various sexual and reproductive health and rights risks. SRHR risks are predictors of poor SRHR outcomes, such as poor knowledge of sexually transmitted diseases and early sexual initiation occurring predominantly among school-age children. The aim of this proposed review, therefore, is to identify educational interventions that have proven to be effective in promoting or supporting the sexual and reproductive health and rights of school-aged children in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: A systematic review of studies on the strategies promoting the SRHR of school-aged children shall be conducted. Electronic searches will be conducted from January 2000 onwards on the following databases: MEDLINE(R) ALL (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOHost), APA PsycInfo (Ovid), ERIC (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Ovid), Education Source (EBSCOHost), Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), SciELO Citation Index (Clarivate Analytics), Global Health (Ovid), and Sociological Abstract (Proquest). Studies eligible for inclusion will be randomized control trials (RCTs), non-randomized trials, quasi-experimental studies (e.g., pre-post tests), and observational studies (cross-sectional and cohort studies). Peer-reviewed studies published in English and/or French and involving school-aged children 5–10 years old will be included. The primary outcomes of interest will include knowledge, awareness, or attitudes about SRHR topics. The secondary outcomes of interest will include sexual and reproductive behaviors. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, abstract data, and full-text articles, and the methodological quality of each study will be appraised using JBI critical appraisal tools. A narrative synthesis of extracted data will be conducted. DISCUSSION: The systematic review will synthesize the evidence on existing educational interventions targeting SRHR outcomes of school-aged children in low- and middle-income countries. It will identify which interventions have proven to be effective, and which interventions have not proven to be effective in promoting or supporting their SRHR. Review findings will provide a useful reference for policy-makers, program developers, global health leaders, and decision makers who wish to support the SRHR of school-age children.

594904,"Patient-Led COVID-19 Triage Systems and Case Fatality Rates: A Comparative Study Between Singapore, Japan, Norway, the USA and the UK.",2020-05-05,"Background: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is an acute complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Historically, the most common pathogens were Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and respiratory syncytial virus. Pediatric patients receiving guideline-adherent therapy experienced fewer ACS-related and all-cause 30-day readmissions compared with those receiving nonadherent therapy. This has not been evaluated in adults. Objectives: The primary objectives were to characterize antibiotic use and pathogens. The secondary objective was to assess the occurrence of readmissions associated with guideline-adherent and clinically appropriate treatment compared with regimens that did not meet those criteria. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted for adults with SCD hospitalized between August 1, 2014, and July 31, 2017, with pneumonia (PNA) or ACS. The study was approved by the institutional review board. Results: A total of 139 patients with 255 hospitalizations were reviewed. Among 41 respiratory cultures, 3 organisms were isolated: Cryptococcus neoformans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and budding yeast. Respiratory panels were collected on 121 admissions, with 17 positive for 1 virus; all were negative for Chlamydophila pneumoniae and M pneumoniae. There were significantly more ACS-/PNA-related 7-day readmissions from patients on guideline-adherent regimens compared with nonadherent regimens (3.7% vs 0%; P = 0.04). Conclusion and Relevance: These findings challenge existing knowledge regarding the most common pathogens in adults with SCD with ACS or PNA. Routine inclusion of a macrolide may not be necessary. Future studies focused on pathogen characterization with standardized assessment are necessary to determine appropriate empirical therapy in this population.","Claudio, Alyssa M.; Foltanski, Lindsey; Delay, Tracie; Britell, Ashley; Duckett, Ashley; Weeda, Erin R.; Bohm, Nicole",Ann Pharmacother,https://doi.org/10.1177/1060028019846118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014083/,478
595036,Pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm secondary to COVID-19 treated with endovascular embolisation,2021-04-18,"The immune spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is poorly understood. To define the dynamics of the immune spectrum in SARS, serum levels of cytokines, chemokines, immunoglobulins, complement and specific antibodies against SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and phenotypes of peripheral lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry in 95 SARS-infected patients. Results showed that interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) were continuously up-regulated during the entirety of SARS. Regulated on activation normally T cell-expressed and secreted (RANTES) levels were decreased, while monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was elevated in acute patients. Immunoglobulins and complement were elevated during the first month of SARS. Both serum-positive rates and titers of specific IgM and IgG antibodies responding to SARS-CoV peaked at days 41–60 from the onset of SARS. CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes decreased significantly in acute-phase. CD3+CD8+CD45RO+ T lymphocytes were decreased by 36.78% in the convalescent patients. Conclusion: SARS-CoV seemed to elicit effective humoral immunity but inhibited cellular immunity, especially CD8+ memory T lymphocytes over time. Prolonged overproduction of IL-10 and TGF-β may play an important role in the disease.","Huang, Jia-Ling; Huang, Jian; Duan, Zhao-Hui; Wei, Jing; Min, Jun; Luo, Xiao-Hong; Li, Jian-Guo; Tan, Wei-Ping; Wu, Li-Zhi; Liu, Ran-Yi; Li, Yan; Shao, Jing; Huang, Bi-Jun; Zeng, Yi-Xin; Huang, Wenlin",Microbes Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457905000304; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457905000304; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15784184/,478

The novel coronavirus disease abbreviated as COVID-19 is the ongoing health crisis which entered into human life in late December 2019. The ease of transmission between humans and the undetectability in early stage makes COVID-19 frightening and unprecedented. The disease is characterised by pneumonia progressing to breathing difficulty, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure. Clinical studies suggest excessive release of inflammatory mediators leads to cytokine storm, a phenomenon which appears to be potentially life-threatening in COVID-19. Across the globe, when the world authorities are grappling to contain the virus, our review provides a glimpse on structure, pathophysiology of the virus and further sheds light on various clinical complications associated with the disease in order to open up/raise new horizons to explore various possible theoretical targets for COVID-19.

595264,Should IBD Patients Be Tested for Active COVID-19 Prior Starting a Biological Treatment?,2020-08-30,"This paper aims to provide a perspective on data sharing practices in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The scientific community has made several important inroads in the fight against COVID-19, and there are over 2500 clinical trials registered globally. Within the context of the rapidly changing pandemic, we are seeing a large number of trials conducted without results being made available. It is likely that a plethora of trials have stopped early, not for statistical reasons but due to lack of feasibility. Trials stopped early for feasibility are, by definition, statistically underpowered and thereby prone to inconclusive findings. Statistical power is not necessarily linear with the total sample size, and even small reductions in patient numbers or events can have a substantial impact on the research outcomes. Given the profusion of clinical trials investigating identical or similar treatments across different geographical and clinical contexts, one must also consider that the likelihood of a substantial number of false-positive and false-negative trials, emerging with the increasing overall number of trials, adds to public perceptions of uncertainty. This issue is complicated further by the evolving nature of the pandemic, wherein baseline assumptions on control group risk factors used to develop sample size calculations are far more challenging than those in the case of well-documented diseases. The standard answer to these challenges during nonpandemic settings is to assess each trial for statistical power and risk-of-bias and then pool the reported aggregated results using meta-analytic approaches. This solution simply will not suffice for COVID-19. Even with random-effects meta-analysis models, it will be difficult to adjust for the heterogeneity of different trials with aggregated reported data alone, especially given the absence of common data standards and outcome measures. To date, several groups have proposed structures and partnerships for data sharing. As COVID-19 has forced reconsideration of policies, processes, and interests, this is the time to advance scientific cooperation and shift the clinical research enterprise toward a data-sharing culture to maximize our response in the service of public health.","Dron, Louis; Dillman, Alison; Zoratti, Michael J; Haggstrom, Jonas; Mills, Edward J; Park, Jay J H",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/26718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33684053/,478

There is a need for a simplified guideline, considering the region's health resources’ low availability, international guidelines, medical literature, and local expertise. Methods Nine experts from Latin American countries developed a simplified algorithm for COVID-19 diagnosis, using a modified Delphi method. Twenty-four questions related to diagnostic settings were proposed, followed by discussion of the literature and experts’ experience. Results The algorithm considers three timeframes (≤7 days, 8-13 days, and ≥ 14 days) and discusses diagnostic options for each one. SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR is the test of choice from day 1 to day 14 after symptom onset or close contact, although antigen testing may be used in particular situations, from days 5 to 7. Antibody assays may be used for confirmation, mainly after day 14.

We present the case of a young female, with no previous diagnosis of diabetes, presenting in DKA complicated by ARDS requiring extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) ventilator support. This case report highlights the importance of early recognition of respiratory complications of severe DKA and their appropriate management. LEARNING POINTS: ARDS is a very rare but life-threatening complication in DKA. The incidence of ARDS remains unknown but less frequent than cerebral oedema in DKA. The mechanism of ARDS in DKA has multifactorial aetiology, including genetic predisposition. Early recognition and consideration of rare pulmonary complication of DKA can increase survival rate and provide very satisfactory outcomes. DKA patients who present with refractory ARDS can be successfully rescued by ECMO support.","Darrat, Milad; Gilmartin, Brian; Kennedy, Carmel; Smith, Diarmuid",Endocrinol Diabetes Metab Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1530/edm-20-0192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34236038/,478
598096,Renal involvement in pediatric patients with COVID-19: an up-to-date,2021,"BACKGROUND: Both COVID-19 and influenza A contribute to increased mortality among the elderly and those with existing comorbidities. Changes in the underlying immune mechanisms determine patient prognosis. This study aimed to analyze the role of lymphocyte subsets in the immunopathogenesisof COVID-19 and severe influenza A, and examined the clinical significance of their alterations in the prognosis and recovery duration. METHODS: By retrospectively reviewing of patients in four groups (healthy controls, severe influenza A, non-severe COVID-19 and severe COVID-19) who were admitted to Ditan hospital between 2018 to 2020, we performed flow cytometric analysis and compared the absolute counts of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets of the patients at different time points (weeks 1–4). RESULTS: We reviewed the patients’ data of 94 healthy blood donors, 80 Non-severe-COVID-19, 19 Severe-COVID-19 and 37 severe influenza A. We found total lymphocytes (0.81 × 10(9)/L vs 1.74 × 10(9)/L, P = 0.001; 0.87 × 10(9)/L vs 1.74 × 10(9)/L, P < 0.0001, respectively) and lymphocyte subsets (T cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell subsets) of severe COVID-19 and severe influenza A patients to be significantly lower than those of healthy donors at early infection stages. Further, significant dynamic variations were observed at different time points (weeks 1–4). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests the plausible role of lymphocyte subsets in disease progression, which in turn affects prognosis and recovery duration in patients with severe COVID-19 and influenza A.

As of January 21, 2021, the virus had infected approximately 100 million people, causing over 2 million deaths. This article analyzed several time series forecasting methods to predict the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic’s second wave in Italy (the period after October 13, 2020). The autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) model, innovations state space models for exponential smoothing (ETS), the neural network autoregression (NNAR) model, the trigonometric exponential smoothing state space model with Box–Cox transformation, ARMA errors, and trend and seasonal components (TBATS), and all of their feasible hybrid combinations were employed to forecast the number of patients hospitalized with mild symptoms and the number of patients hospitalized in the intensive care units (ICU). The data for the period February 21, 2020–October 13, 2020 were extracted from the website of the Italian Ministry of Health (www.salute.gov.it). The results showed that (i) hybrid models were better at capturing the linear, nonlinear, and seasonal pandemic patterns, significantly outperforming the respective single models for both time series, and (ii) the numbers of COVID-19-related hospitalizations of patients with mild symptoms and in the ICU were projected to increase rapidly from October 2020 to mid-November 2020. According to the estimations, the necessary ordinary and intensive care beds were expected to double in 10 days and to triple in approximately 20 days. These predictions were consistent with the observed trend, demonstrating that hybrid models may facilitate public health authorities’ decision-making, especially in the short-term.","Perone, Gaetano",Eur J Health Econ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-021-01347-4; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11617v1.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34347175/,478
598676,COVID-19 should be a methylene blue “promoter”,2020,"BACKGROUND: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked heated debate among scholars on the relevance of lockdowns. There are those in favor of the lockdown and others who are critical of it. However, despite the increased interest in understanding the relevance of lockdowns, there still has not been much focus on its relevance in countries like Zambia. Thus, with the help of the Social Representation Theory (SRT), we set out to explore and document the local characterization of the lockdown by residents of Lusaka, Zambia. METHODS: We recruited our participants through convenient and purposive sampling techniques. This was done through the use of the ZAMTEL public phone records. Initial contact was made to potential participants, and they were asked of their availability and willingness to participate in the interview. Upon agreeing to participate, they were included in the sample. A total of 68 people were selected to take part in this study. Their age ranged from 20 to 76 years old. 33 of them were male and 35 females. After this, we conducted interviews with the 68 participants. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, our interviews were conducted via telephone in conformity with the recommendations from the IRB in Lusaka and the advice of the ministry of health. We anonymized the demographic characteristics and responses from our participants. Later, thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The lockdown was on one hand lauded for slowing down the incidence rates, preventing fatalities, and protecting the healthcare system from collapse. On the other hand, it was criticized for exacerbating poverty levels, unemployment rates, increasing the rate of mental health problems, aiding gender-based violence, and intensifying political repression and corruption. The results speak to the complexity in the characterization of the lockdown as a response to COVID-19 in Lusaka, Zambia. This observation demonstrates the folly of viewing, applying and characterizing the COVID-19 lockdown as a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach in Lusaka, Zambia. CONCLUSION: Rather than establishing the lockdown as an incontestable good, as it is depicted by some scholars or as useless by its critics, our findings instead demonstrate the diversity and complexity in how it is locally viewed by Lusaka residents. The study provides grounds for caution on simplistic and binary characterization of lockdowns. It indicates the need for careful dialog between the designers of lockdowns and citizens in order to tailor such interventions to local realities in context-specific ways. It also shows that though the development of such interventions, all the various and complex elements it embodies must be taken into account in order to realize optimum outcomes.","Muzyamba, Choolwe",Glob Health Res Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34593052/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s41256-021-00220-4,478

In response to the global coronavirus pandemic, early diagnosis of the disease is vital to prevent the virus from being spread to a larger population. Because of the unavailability of precise diagnostic toolkits, there arises a crying need to find efficient techniques that can be implemented for faster disease prediction while ensuring the accuracy of the prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI)–based solutions have the potential to help diagnose COVID-19 pandemic in an effective way. Automated image analysis with AI techniques can support clinical decision-making, improve workflow efficiency, and allow accurate and fast diagnosis of infection in a large number of patients. In the present study, existing convolutional neural network (CNN) models such as ResNeXt, Channel Boosted CNN, DenseNet, AlexNet, and VGG 16 were repurposed to assist in identifying the presence of COVID-19 before they reach mass scale. The dataset used in the study comprises of computed tomography (CT) images taken from 275 healthy individuals and 195 COVID-19 samples collected from 216 affected individuals. The proposed AI-based approach using deep learning models classifies COVID-19 affected cases by analyzing CT images and provides rapid detection of COVID-19 in a shorter time span. Ensemble classifier employed in this study proved to predict the presence of infection with a greater accuracy of 90.67% compared to the other similar works in the literature.","Tharsanee, R.M.; Soundariya, R.S.; Kumar, A.

This study takes a holistic approach to better understand and analyze the multiple factors and their interconnections that contribute to the complexity of this problem. A systems analysis was conducted by utilizing the system dynamics method, which allows analyzing and comparing trends and behavior of system outcomes for different “what if” scenarios, interventions, and policy implications. Three leverage points were identified in this study to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the current strategies to address homelessness: (1) increasing the number of affordable permanent housing units, (2) increasing the utilization of transitional housing units or shelters by the individuals experiencing homelessness, and (3) providing preventative services to at-risk populations before the onset of homelessness. Our results demonstrate that the most effective strategy is an amalgam of the solutions identified by these three leverage points. In addition, a policy analysis was conducted to study and estimate the effectiveness of various potential scenarios. This research provides data-driven and model-based insights into how decision-makers can utilize a systems approach to analyze new policy implications and create effective solutions to homelessness.","Nourazari, Sara; Lovato, Kristina; Weng, Suzie S.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33435221/,478

In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), its role may be of further importance because it is performed bedside and may limit chest X-ray and the need for transport to radiology for computed tomography (CT) scan. Since February 21, we progressively turned into a coronavirus-dedicated intensive care unit and applied an ultrasound-based approach to avoid traditional imaging and limit contamination as much as possible. We performed a complete daily examination with lung ultrasound score computation and systematic search of complications (pneumothorax, ventilator-associated pneumonia); on-duty physicians were free to perform CT or chest X-ray when deemed indicated. We compared conventional imaging exams performed in the first 4 wk of the COVID-19 epidemic with those in the same time frame in 2019: there were 84 patients in 2020 and 112 in 2019; 64 and 22 (76.2% vs. 19.6%, p < 0.001) had acute respiratory failure, respectively, of which 55 (85.9%) were COVID-19 in 2020. When COVID-19 patients in 2020 were compared with acute respiratory failure patients in 2019, the median number of chest X-rays was 1.0 (1.0–2.0) versus 3.0 (1.0–4.0) (p = 0.0098); 2 patients 2 (3.6%) versus 7 patients (31.8%) had undergone at least one thoracic CT scan (p = 0.001). A self-imposed ultrasound-based approach reduces the number of chest X-rays and thoracic CT scans in COVID-19 patients compared with patients with standard acute respiratory failure, thus reducing the number of health care providers exposed to possible contamination and sparing personal protective equipment.","Mongodi, Silvia; Orlando, Anita; Arisi, Eric; Tavazzi, Guido; Santangelo, Erminio; Caneva, Luca; Pozzi, Marco; Pariani, Eleonora; Bettini, Giada; Maggio, Giuseppe; Perlini, Stefano; Preda, Lorenzo; Iotti, Giorgio Antonio; Mojoli, Francesco",Ultrasound Med Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32451194/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2020.04.033; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301562920302052?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301562920302052,478

Ainsi, l’intérêt de l’hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), du tocilizumab ou des corticoïdes a été particulièrement controversé. L’objectif de notre étude est de décrire les attitudes thérapeutiques pour la prise en charge des COVID-19 et leur évolution au cours de la période épidémique en France.

Il recueillait les caractéristiques d’exercice des répondants, les références utilisées pour la prise en charge des patients COVID-19 et les prescriptions réalisées ou privilégiées (molécules et indications). Résultats Nous avons analysé 144 réponses issues de 115 médecins. Cinquante-trois (46 %) exercent en centre hospitalier universitaire, 79 (69 %) dans un service de maladies infectieuses. Dix-neuf médecins (32 %) de la première étude participaient à au moins un protocole de recherche (5 études différentes), contre 40 (74 %) d’entre eux lors de la deuxième étude (18 protocoles, p <0,01). Quarante-six médecins (77 %) proposaient un traitement spécifique à la première enquête, 35 (65 %) à la deuxième, et 27 (90 %) l’envisageaient à la dernière, uniquement en contexte hospitalier. Quinze (33 %) de ces prescriptions se faisaient dans le cadre de la recherche à la première enquête contre 16 (59 %) à la dernière. Initialement proposée par 35 (76 %) et 22 (63 %) prescripteurs aux 2 premières enquêtes, l’HCQ est envisagée par 5 d’entre eux (19 %) en juin (p <0,01), uniquement dans le cadre de la recherche.

602601,Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on cancer clinician decision making: Known knowns and known unknowns,2020-04-25,"Long COVID is characterized by the emergence of multiple debilitating symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Its etiology is unclear and it often follows a mild acute illness. Anecdotal reports of gradual clinical responses to histamine receptor antagonists (HRAs) suggest a histamine-dependent mechanism that is distinct from anaphylaxis, possibly mediated by T cells, which are also regulated by histamine. T cell perturbations have been previously reported in post-viral syndromes, but the T cell landscape in patients who have recovered from mild COVID-19 and its relationship to both long COVID symptoms and any symptomatic response to HRA remain underexplored. We addressed these questions in an observational study of 65 individuals who had recovered from mild COVID-19. Participants were surveyed between 87 and 408 days after the onset of acute symptoms; none had required hospitalization, 16 had recovered uneventfully, and 49 had developed long COVID. Symptoms were quantified using a structured questionnaire and T cell subsets enumerated in a standard diagnostic assay. Patients with long-COVID had reduced CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory (EM) cell numbers and increased PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) expression on central memory (CM) cells, whereas the asymptomatic participants had reduced CD8+ EM cells only and increased CD28 expression on CM cells. 72% of patients with long COVID who received HRA reported clinical improvement, although T cell profiling did not clearly distinguish those who responded to HRA. This study demonstrates that T cell perturbations persist for several months after mild COVID-19 and are associated with long COVID symptoms.","Glynne, Paul; Tahmasebi, Natasha; Gant, Vanya; Gupta, Rajeev",J Investig Med,https://doi.org/10.1136/jim-2021-002051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34611034/,478

Moreover, the elderly population might be effectively treated by surgery alone, thus saving oncological resources for younger people who need a more aggressive approach. In this framework, prioritization is a key concept based on the severity of symptoms and the need for urgent (surgical) intervention. High-risk and marginally effective surgery should be replaced with definitive radio- and/or chemotherapy. The pandemic framework to provide optimal care for GC patients must be based on multidisciplinary decision-making and include all anti-cancer treatment options: surgery, systemic therapy, and radiotherapy. The priority and staffing dictate adherence to the new algorithm. We believe that these priorities may improve the delivery of care to all, including elderly GC patients.","Polkowski, Wojciech Piotr; Sędłak, Katarzyna; Rawicz-Pruszyński, Karol",Cancer management and research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32801886/; https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=60083; https://doi.org/10.2147/cmar.s260842,478
603247,Collapse induration of alveoli is an ultrastructural finding in a COVID-19 patient,2021-01-14,"Immune privilege (IP), a term introduced to explain the unpredicted acceptance of allogeneic grafts by the eye and the brain, is considered a unique property of these tissues. However, immune responses are modified by the tissue in which they occur, most of which possess IP to some degree. The eye therefore displays a spectrum of IP because it comprises several tissues. IP as originally conceived can only apply to the retina as it contains few tissue-resident bone-marrow derived myeloid cells and is immunologically shielded by a sophisticated barrier – an inner vascular and an outer epithelial barrier at the retinal pigment epithelium. The vascular barrier comprises the vascular endothelium and the glia limitans. Immune cells do not cross the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) despite two-way transport of interstitial fluid, governed by tissue oncotic pressure. The BRB, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) mature in the neonatal period under signals from the expanding microbiome and by 18 months are fully established. However, the adult eye is susceptible to intraocular inflammation (uveitis; frequency ~200/100,000 population). Uveitis involving the retinal parenchyma (posterior uveitis, PU) breaches IP, while IP is essentially irrelevant in inflammation involving the ocular chambers, uveal tract and ocular coats (anterior/intermediate uveitis/sclerouveitis, AU). Infections cause ~50% cases of AU and PU but infection may also underlie the pathogenesis of immune-mediated “non-infectious” uveitis. Dysbiosis accompanies the commonest form, HLA-B27–associated AU, while latent infections underlie BRB breakdown in PU. This review considers the pathogenesis of uveitis in the context of IP, infection, environment, and the microbiome.","Mölzer, Christine; Heissigerova, Jarmila; Wilson, Heather M.; Kuffova, Lucia; Forrester, John V.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.608377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33569055/,478

We found genomic and evolutionary evidences of the occurrence of 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus (named as Pangolin-CoV) from dead Malayan Pangolins. Pangolin-CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical at the whole genome level to 2019-nCoV and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively. Pangolin-CoV is the lowest common ancestor of 2019-nCoV and RaTG13. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to 2019-nCoV than RaTG13. Five key amino-acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and 2019-nCoV but four amino-acid mutations occur in RaTG13. It indicates Pangolin-CoV has similar pathogenic potential to 2019-nCoV, and would be helpful to trace the origin and probable intermediate host of 2019-nCoV.","Zhang, Tao; Wu, Qunfu; Zhang, Zhigang",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.19.950253,478

603734,Neurological features and outcome in COVID-19: dementia can predict severe disease,2021-01-08,"Background and Objective: COVID-19 has engulfed the entire world, with many countries struggling to contain the pandemic. In order to understand how each country is impacted by the virus compared with what would have been expected prior to the pandemic and the mortality risk on a global scale, a multi-factor weighted spatial analysis is presented. Method: A number of key developmental indicators across three main categories of demographics, economy, and health infrastructure were used, supplemented with a range of dynamic indicators associated with COVID-19 as independent variables. Using normalised COVID-19 mortality on 13 May 2020 as a dependent variable, a linear regression (N = 153 countries) was performed to assess the predictive power of the various indicators. Results: The results of the assessment show that when in combination, dynamic and static indicators have higher predictive power to explain risk variation in COVID-19 mortality compared with static indicators alone. Furthermore, as of 13 May 2020 most countries were at a similar or lower risk level than what would have been expected pre-COVID, with only 44/153 countries experiencing a more than 20% increase in mortality risk. The ratio of elderly emerges as a strong predictor but it would be worthwhile to consider it in light of the family makeup of individual countries. Conclusion: In conclusion, future avenues of data acquisition related to COVID-19 are suggested. The paper concludes by discussing the ability of various factors to explain COVID-19 mortality risk. The ratio of elderly in combination with the dynamic variables associated with COVID-19 emerge as more significant risk predictors in comparison to socio-economic and demographic indicators.","Arsalan, Mudassar; Mubin, Omar; Alnajjar, Fady; Alsinglawi, Belal",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17155592; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32756513/,478

Common and novel respiratory viruses can occasionally cause epidemics of viral pneumonitis with severe acute respiratory symptoms (sars). In 2003, World Health Organisation (WHO) coined the word SARS for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in patients with a relevant travel/contact history and sars. The WHO case definition of suspected SARS was fever, respiratory symptoms and close contact with SARS patients or travel history to an epidemic area. The clinical features are essentially the same as for any respiratory viral infections or pneumonitis. Since 2003, many new surveillance guidelines and confusing abbreviations appeared in the city of Hong Kong. In 2012, another outbreak of coronavirus pneumonitis occurred in the Middle-East. More case definitions such as MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Infections) were coined for the viral pneumonitis. In medicine, a definition or syndrome representing “a constellation of symptomatology seen in association” should stand the trial of time after it is coined. Health organisations should provide consistent definitions for index surveillance, epidemiological and prognostication studies.

The impact of COVID-19 on other organs remains elusive. Herein, we aimed to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on the hepatobiliary system. METHODS: In the current study, we obtained the clinical records and laboratory results from 66 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 at the Wuhan Tongji Hospital between 10 February 2020 and 28 February 2020. The detailed clinical features and laboratory findings were collected for analysis. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to evaluate the correlation between gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). RESULTS: In this cohort, 30 (51.7%) patients had abnormal liver function on admission, which was associated with disease severity and enriched in the male and diabetic patients. The elevated levels of direct bilirubin (P = 0.029) and GGT (P = 0.004) were common in patients with severe pneumonia when compared with those with mild pneumonia. In addition, elevated levels of GGT (P = 0.003) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P = 0.007) were positively associated with longer hospital stay. The expression of ACE2 was closely associated with GGT in various human tissues because they shared the common transcriptional regulator hepatic nuclear factor-1β (HNF1B). CONCLUSIONS: Increased GGT levels were common in severe cases and elevated GGT levels were positively associated with prolonged hospital stay and disease severity. Due to the consistent expression with ACE2, GGT is a potent biomarker indicating the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Liu, Jianrong; Yu, Chao; Yang, Qing; Yuan, Xiaofeng; Yang, Fan; Li, Panlong; Chen, Guihua; Liang, Weicheng; Yang, Yang",Liver Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livres.2021.09.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34603826/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2542568421000581; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542568421000581?v=s5,478

This paper aimed to explore the breast cancer information acquisition behaviours and needs among Singapore women who attended a community-based health organisation for mammography screening. METHODS, DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 37 racially diverse, aged 50 and above women, who have received mammography screening within the past two years. The interviews were conducted at either the Singapore Cancer Society Clinic or participant’s home. RESULTS: Although cancer information scanning was more prevalent than information seeking (91.9% vs. 62.2%), those who purposively seek information exhibited a higher knowledge level of breast cancer. The most commonly cited sources for information scanning were friends, television and family, and for information seeking were the Internet, pamphlets from a healthcare organisation/ public authority, and healthcare providers. Singapore women were well-informed about the benefits of mammogram; however, specific knowledge, such as modifiable risk factors, reasons for different screening options and the trade-off between harm and benefit, was still lacking which led to confusion about screening. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer health educational materials should provide clear and balanced information to give women a more accurate or realistic expectation about mammography screening. Study findings provide important implications for breast cancer education and programs to move beyond simply raising awareness and craft specific informative messages addressing the needs of the target group.","Lin, Lavinia; Koh, Wee Ling; Huang, Qing; Lee, Jeong Kyu",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,https://doi.org/10.31557/apjcp.2021.22.6.1767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34181332/,478
609287,Co-Infection with COVID-19 and Malaria in a Young Man,2021-03-30,"Background: The full impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy remains uncharacterized. Current literature suggests minimal maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality,1 and COVID-19 manifestations appear similar between pregnant and non-pregnant women.2 We present a case of placental SARS-CoV-2 virus in a woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy and mild COVID-19 disease. Methods: A pregnant woman was evaluated at University of Missouri Women and Childrens Hospital. Institutional review board approval was obtained; information was obtained from medical records. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2. A gynecological pathologist examined the placenta and performed histolopathology. Sections were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded; slides were cut and subjected to hematoxylin-and-eosin or immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. IHC was performed with specific monoclonal antibodies to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen or to identify trophoblasts. Findings: A 29 year-old multigravida presented at 40-4/7 weeks for labor induction. With myalgias two days prior, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her parents were in self-isolation for COVID-19 positivity; husband was asymptomatic and tested negative for COVID-19, but exposed to a workplace (meatpacking facility) outbreak. Prenatal course was uncomplicated, with no gestational hypertension. She was afebrile and asymptomatic with normal vital signs throughout hospitalization. Her myalgias improved prior to admission. A liveborn male infant was delivered vaginally. Newborn course was uneventful; he was appropriate for gestational age, physical was unremarkable, and he was discharged home at 36 hours. COVID-19 RT-PCR test was negative at 24 hours. At one-week follow-up, newborn was breastfeeding well, with no fevers or respiratory distress. Overall placental histology is consistent with acute uterine hypoxia (subchorionic laminar necrosis) superimposed on chronic uterine hypoxia (extra-villous trophoblasts and focal chronic villitis). IHC using SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific monoclonal antibody demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 antigens throughout the placenta in chorionic villi endothelial cells, and rarely in CK7-expressing trophoblasts. Negative control placenta (November 2019 delivery) and ferret nasal turbinate tissues (not shown) were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Interpretation: In this report, SARS-CoV-2 was found in the placenta, but newborn was COVID-19 negative. Our case shows maternal vascular malperfusion, with no features of fetal vascular malperfusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of placental COVID-19 despite mild COVID-19 disease in pregnancy (with no symptoms of COVID-19 aside from myalgias); specifically, this patient had no fever, cough, or shortness of breath, but only myalgias and sick contacts. Despite her having mild COVID-19 disease in pregnancy, we demonstrate placental vasculopathy and presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus across the placenta. Evidence of placental COVID-19 raises concern for possible placental vasculopathy (potentially leading to fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, and other pregnancy complications) as well as for potential vertical transmission -- especially for pregnant women who may be exposed to COVID-19 in early pregnancy. Further studies are urgently needed, to determine whether women with mild, pre-symptomatic, or asymptomatic COVID-19 may have SARS-CoV-2 virus that can cross the placenta, cause fetal vascular malperfusion, and possibly affect the fetus. This raises important public health and public policy questions of whether future pregnancy guidance should include stricter pandemic precautions, such as screening for a wider array of COVID-19 symptoms, increased antenatal surveillance, and possibly routine COVID-19 testing on a regular basis throughout pregnancy.","Hsu, A.

The generalizability of many is unknown. We evaluated the performance of selected models from the literature and our own models to predict outcomes in patients at our institution. METHODS: We searched the literature for models predicting outcomes in inpatients with COVID-19. We produced models of mortality or criticality (mortality or ICU admission) in a development cohort. We tested external models which provided sufficient information and our models using a test cohort of our most recent patients. The performance of models was compared using the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC). RESULTS: Our literature review yielded 41 papers. Of those, 8 were found to have sufficient documentation and concordance with features available in our cohort to implement in our test cohort. All models were from Chinese patients. One model predicted criticality and seven mortality. Tested against the test cohort, internal models had an AUC of 0.84 (0.74–0.94) for mortality and 0.83 (0.76–0.90) for criticality. The best external model had an AUC of 0.89 (0.82–0.96) using three variables, another an AUC of 0.84 (0.78–0.91) using ten variables. AUC’s ranged from 0.68 to 0.89. On average, models tested were unable to produce predictions in 27% of patients due to missing lab data. CONCLUSION: Despite differences in pandemic timeline, race, and socio-cultural healthcare context some models derived in China performed well. For healthcare organizations considering implementation of an external model, concordance between the features used in the model and features available in their own patients may be important.

In this study, we determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels at day 0 (baseline, before vaccination), day 28 ± 2 post-first dose (month 1) and day 56 ± 2 days post-first dose (month 2) of BBV152 whole-virion-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 recipients, and compared the antibody responses of individuals with confirmed pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection to those individuals without prior evidence of infection. METHODS Blood samples were collected from 114 healthcare professionals and frontline workers who received BBV152 vaccine from February to May 2021. Prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 was determined at baseline. Serum samples were used to estimate SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein-specific IgG [IgG (N)], spike protein-specific IgG [IgG (S)] and neutralizing antibodies (NAb). RESULTS Participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection after a single vaccine dose elicited IgG (N) and IgG (S) antibody levels along with NAb binding inhibition responses levels were similar to infection-naïve vaccinated participants who had taken two doses of vaccine. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary data suggested that a single dose of BBV152-induced humoral immunity in previously infected individuals was equivalent to two doses of the vaccine in infection-naïve individuals. However, these findings need to be confirmed with large sized cohort studies.","Kumar, Nathella Pavan; Padmapriyadarsini, C; Uma Devi, K R; Banurekha, V V; Nancy, Arul; Girish Kumar, C P; Murhekar, Manoj V; Gupta, Nivedita; Panda, Samiran; Babu, Subash; Bhargava, Balram",The Indian journal of medical research,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_2066_21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34528524/,478

This is seen as a preliminary step in the analysis of the mechanical effects of CPAP masks applied to human faces, such as recently employed for the care of COVID-19 patients, or other purposes. These mechanical effects can range from negligible, in the case of correct positioning, sufficiently light tension in the headgear, correct mask design, etc., to the possible development of device-related pressure ulcers and/or dentofacial deformations, especially in children. The results of Finite Element analyses are compared, for their validation, with experimental ones. The numerical analysis tool appears able to predict, at an acceptable cost, both the intensity and the area distribution of the contact pressures, as well as the force-displacement relationship occurring in the headgear. This might help the design and the production of more effective and tolerable CPAP masks.","Genna, Francesco; Lopomo, Nicola Francesco; Savoldi, Fabio",Comput Methods Biomech Biomed Engin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34525878/; https://doi.org/10.1080/10255842.2021.1940975,478
612509,Airborne contamination of COVID-19 in hospitals: a scoping review of the current evidence.,2020-09-09,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated the clinical performance of an immunochromatographic (IC) IgM/IgG antibody assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and chest computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We examined 139 serum specimens collected from 112 patients with COVID-19 and 48 serum specimens collected from 48 non-COVID-19 patients. The presence of IgM/IgG antibody for SARS-COV2 was determined using the One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Antibody Test. Chest CT was performed in COVID-19 patients on admission. FINDINGS: Of the139 COVID-19 serum specimens, IgM was detected in 27.8 %, 48.0 %, and 95.8 % of the specimens collected within 1 week, 1–2 weeks, and >2 weeks after symptom onset and IgG was detected in 3.3 %, 8.0 %, and 62.5 %, respectively. Among the 48 non-COVID-19 serum specimens, 1 generated a false-positive result for IgM. Thirty-eight of the 112 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, of whom 15 were positive for IgM, and 74 were symptomatic, of whom 22 were positive for IgM and 7 were positive for IgG. The diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan alone and in combination with the IC assay was 57.9 % (22/38) and 68.4 % (26/38) for the asymptomatic patients and 74.3 % (55/74) and 82.4 % (61/74) for the symptomatic patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: The IC assay had low sensitivity during the early phase of infection, and thus IC assay alone is not recommended for initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19. If RT-qPCR is not available, the combination of chest CT and IC assay may be useful for diagnosing COVID-19.","Imai, Kazuo; Tabata, Sakiko; Ikeda, Mayu; Noguchi, Sakiko; Kitagawa, Yutaro; Matuoka, Masaru; Miyoshi, Kazuyasu; Tarumoto, Norihito; Sakai, Jun; Ito, Toshimitsu; Maesaki, Shigefumi; Tamura, Kaku; Maeda, Takuya",J Clin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301359; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32387968/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301359?v=s5,478

612844,Utilizing the Cool-Down Phenomenon to Differentiate Supraventricular Tachycardias in a Patient with COVID-19 Infection,2021-08-17,"BACKGROUND: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is frequently associated with hyperinflammation and hyperferritinemia. The latter is related to increased mortality in COVID-19. Still, it is not clear if iron dysmetabolism is mechanistically linked to COVID-19 pathobiology. METHODS: We herein present data from the ongoing prospective, multicentre, observational CovILD cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04416100), which systematically follows up patients after COVID-19. 109 participants were evaluated 60 days after onset of first COVID-19 symptoms including clinical examination, chest computed tomography and laboratory testing. RESULTS: We investigated subjects with mild to critical COVID-19, of which the majority received hospital treatment. 60 days after disease onset, 30% of subjects still presented with iron deficiency and 9% had anemia, mostly categorized as anemia of inflammation. Anemic patients had increased levels of inflammation markers such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein and survived a more severe course of COVID-19. Hyperferritinemia was still present in 38% of all individuals and was more frequent in subjects with preceding severe or critical COVID-19. Analysis of the mRNA expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated a correlation of increased ferritin and cytokine mRNA expression in these patients. Finally, persisting hyperferritinemia was significantly associated with severe lung pathologies in computed tomography scans and a decreased performance status as compared to patients without hyperferritinemia. DISCUSSION: Alterations of iron homeostasis can persist for at least two months after the onset of COVID-19 and are closely associated with non-resolving lung pathologies and impaired physical performance. Determination of serum iron parameters may thus be a easy to access measure to monitor the resolution of COVID-19.

613562,Considerations for the Treatment of Oesophageal Cancer With Radiotherapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-04-09,"Objectives Multimorbidity, defined as the co-occurrence of at least two chronic diseases, is a common occurrence with ageing and a recognised public health concern, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The multimorbidity population is more susceptible to the virus, its complications and death. The study aimed to explore the multimorbidity characteristics and their associations at a population level for the first time in Malta. Such data enables adequate priority and policy planning due to COVID-19’s predilection for this population. Study Design and Methods: Baseline data was collected from 3,947 adults recruited between 2014-2016. A single-stage sampling strategy was implemented and stratified by age (18 – 70 years), sex and locality. Participants were invited to attend a health examination survey consisting of a questionnaire, anthropometric and biological measurements. Descriptive (chi-square) and analytic (regression modelling) statistics were used to determine the characteristics and associations of the multimorbidity population. The chronic diseases considered for multimorbidity were type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, myocardial infraction, coronary heart disease and dyslipidaemia. Results Multimorbidity was present in 33% (CI 95%: 31.54 – 34.47) of the study population, with a male predominance. Hypertension and myocardial infarction were the commonest multimorbidity combination from a young age group (20 – 30 years). Low socioeconomic status and residing on the island of Gozo were positively associated with multimorbidity. Conclusion Multimorbidity in Malta was evident from a young age, with the highest occurrence among the low socioeconomic status and residents of Gozo, bringing forward the need for preventive action. An adoptive healthcare system and policies are recommended to prevent, support and manage multimorbidity non-communicable diseases while bracing for the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Cuschieri, Sarah; Grech, Stephan",Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350621000068; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.12.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33611169/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350621000068?v=s5,478

615290,The impact of COVID-19 on the clinical outcome of patients with cirrhosis deserves more attention and research,2020-06-20,"The major threat to human societies posed by undernutrition has been recognised for millennia. Despite substantial economic development and scientific innovation, however, progress in addressing this global challenge has been inadequate. Paradoxically, the last half-century also saw the rapid emergence of obesity, first in high-income countries but now also in low- and middle-income countries. Traditionally, these problems were approached separately, but there is increasing recognition that they have common drivers and need integrated responses. The new nutrition reality comprises a global ‘double burden’ of malnutrition, where the challenges of food insecurity, nutritional deficiencies and undernutrition coexist and interact with obesity, sedentary behaviour, unhealthy diets and environments that foster unhealthy behaviour. Beyond immediate efforts to prevent and treat malnutrition, what must change in order to reduce the future burden? Here, we present a conceptual framework that focuses on the deeper structural drivers of malnutrition embedded in society, and their interaction with biological mechanisms of appetite regulation and physiological homeostasis. Building on a review of malnutrition in past societies, our framework brings to the fore the power dynamics that characterise contemporary human food systems at many levels. We focus on the concept of agency, the ability of individuals or organisations to pursue their goals. In globalized food systems, the agency of individuals is directly confronted by the agency of several other types of actor, including corporations, governments and supranational institutions. The intakes of energy and nutrients by individuals are powerfully shaped by this ‘competition of agency’, and we therefore argue that the greatest opportunities to reduce malnutrition lie in rebalancing agency across the competing actors. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on food systems and individuals illustrates our conceptual framework. Efforts to improve agency must both drive and respond to complementary efforts to promote and maintain equitable societies and planetary health.","Wells, Jonathan C.

Because SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmitted through the air and has a relatively long incubation time, COVID-19 has rapidly developed into a global pandemic. As there are no antiviral agents for the prevention and treatment of this severe pathogen except for remdesivir, development of antiviral therapies to treat infected individuals remains highly urgent. Here, we showed that baicalein and baicalin exhibited significant antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 through in vitro studies. Our data through cell-based and biochemical studies showed that both compounds act as SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors directly and inhibit the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, but baicalein was more potent. We also showed specific binding of baicalein to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, making it a potential candidate for further studies towards therapeutic development for COVID-19 as a selective non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor.","Zandi, Keivan; Musall, Katie; Oo, Adrian; Cao, Dongdong; Liang, Bo; Hassandarvish, Pouya; Lan, Shuiyun; Slack, Ryan L.; Kirby, Karen A.; Bassit, Leda; Amblard, Franck; Kim, Baek; AbuBakar, Sazaly; Sarafianos, Stefan G.; Schinazi, Raymond F.",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9050893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33921971/,478
615692,The Right Ventricle: A Target in COVID-19 Cardiac Insult,2020-10-27,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced incidence of many viral and bacterial infections has been reported in children: bronchiolitis, varicella, measles, pertussis, pneumococcal and meningococcal invasive diseases. The purpose of this opinion paper is to discuss various situations that could lead to larger epidemics when the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) imposed by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will no longer be necessary. While NPIs limited the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, they also reduced the spread of other pathogens during and after lockdown periods, despite the re-opening of schools since June 2020 in France. This positive collateral effect in the short term is welcome as it prevents additional overload of the healthcare system. The lack of immune stimulation due to the reduced circulation of microbial agents and to the related reduced vaccine uptake induced an ""immunity debt"" which could have negative consequences when the pandemic is under control and NPIs are lifted. The longer these periods of ""viral or bacterial low-exposure"" are, the greater the likelihood of future epidemics. This is due to a growing proportion of ""susceptible"" people and a declined herd immunity in the population. The observed delay in vaccination program without effective catch-up and the decrease in viral and bacterial exposures lead to a rebound risk of vaccine-preventable diseases. With a vaccination schedule that does not include vaccines against rotavirus, varicella, and serogroup B and ACYW Neisseria meningitidis, France could become more vulnerable to some of these rebound effects.","Cohen, Robert; Ashman, Marion; Taha, Muhamed-Kheir; Varon, Emmanuelle; Angoulvant, François; Levy, Corinne; Ryback, Alexis; Ouldali, Naim; Guiso, Nicole; Grimprel, Emmanuel",Infect Dis Now,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33991720/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666991921001123?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idnow.2021.05.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666991921001123,478

Serological assays are essential for community screening, assessing infection prevalence, aiding identification of infected patients, and enacting appropriate treatment and quarantine protocols in the battle against this rapidly expanding pandemic. Antibody detection by agglutination–PCR (ADAP) is a pure solution phase immunoassay that generates a PCR amplifiable signal when patient antibodies agglutinate DNA-barcoded antigen probes into a dense immune complex. Here, we present an ultrasensitive and high-throughput automated liquid biopsy assay based on the Hamilton Microlab ADAP STAR automated liquid-handling platform, which was developed and validated for the qualitative detection of total antibodies against spike protein 1 (S1) of SARS-CoV-2 that uses as little as 4 µL of serum. To assess the clinical performance of the ADAP assay, 57 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 223 control patients were tested. The assay showed a sensitivity of 98% (56/57) and a specificity of 99.55% (222/223). Notably, the SARS-CoV-2–negative control patients included individuals with other common coronaviral infections, such as CoV-NL63 and CoV-HKU, which did not cross-react. In addition to high performance, the hands-free automated workstation enabled high-throughput sample processing to reduce screening workload while helping to minimize analyst contact with biohazardous samples. Therefore, the ADAP STAR liquid-handling workstation can be used as a valuable tool to address the COVID-19 global pandemic.","Karp, Donna Grace; Cuda, Deanne; Tandel, Devangkumar; Danh, Kenneth; Robinson, Peter V.; Seftel, David; Tian, Honglin; Pandori, Mark; Miller, Kevin W.

The objectives of this study were to compare the antiviral activity between monomeric catechin and dimeric procyanidin B2 (PB2) using cultivable human norovirus surrogates (feline calicivirus (FCV-F9) and murine norovirus (MNV-1)) and to understand their potential antiviral mechanism using virus-like particles (VLPs) and the P domain of human norovirus GII (HNoV GII.4). Surrogate viruses at 5 log PFU/mL were treated with 0.5–5 mg/mL monomeric catechin monohydrate, PB2 or phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2; control) at 37 °C over 24 h. Infectivity was determined using plaque assays and data from triplicate experiments were statistically analyzed. PB2 at 0.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL reduced FCV-F9 to undetectable levels after 3 h and MNV-1 by 0.21 and 1.23 log PFU after 24 h, respectively. Monomeric catechins at 1 mg/mL reduced FCV-F9 to undetectable levels after 6 h and MNV-1 titers to undetectable levels after 24 h. In addition, PB2 was shown to directly bind the P domain, the main capsid structure of HNoVs in the ratio of 1:1 through spontaneous interactions. Electrostatic interactions played a dominant role between PB2 and the P domain. PB2 significantly altered tertiary but not secondary structures of VLPs. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that PB2 aggregated VLPs, further indicating interactions between them. These findings indicate that PB2 causes structural changes of the P domain of VLPs, mainly through direct interaction leading to HNoV inactivation.","Liu, Dan; Deng, Jianjun; Joshi, Snehal; Liu, Pengbo; Zhang, Chao; Yu, Yan; Zhang, Ruijuan; Fan, Daidi; Yang, Haixia; D'Souza, Doris H.",Food Microbiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0740002018300637; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740002018300637; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2018.06.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30166160/,478

In plot 2, 14 days after the last spraying, the residues decreased by ~91.3% compared with those in the samples on day 0. The residues in the crops decreased by ~40.8% of the initial concentration owing to growth (dilution effect) and by ~50.6% after excluding the dilution effect. As the flight speed increased, picarbutrazox residues decreased (p < 0.05, least significant deviation [LSD]). At 2 m s(−1) flight speed, the residual distribution differed from the dilution rate of the spraying solution. The average range of picarbutrazox residues at all sampling points was 0.007 to 0.486, below the limit of quantitation −0.395, 0.005–0.316, and 0.005–0.289 mg kg(−1) in plots 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, showing significant differences (p < 0.05, LSD). These results indicated that the residual distribution of picarbutrazox sprayed by using a multicopter on the Chinese cabbages was not uniform. However, the residues were less than the maximum residue limit in all plots. Accordingly, picarbutrazox was considered to have a low risk to human health if it was sprayed on cabbage according to the recommended spraying conditions.","Kim, Chang Jo; Jeong, Won Tae; Kyung, Kee Sung; Lee, Hee-Dong; Kim, Danbi; Song, Ho Sung; Kang, Younkoo; Noh, Hyun Ho",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26185671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577141/,478
617362,Risk of Burnout and Stress in Physicians Working in a COVID Team: A Longitudinal Survey.,2021-08-27,"Inflammation is closely related to renal diseases. This is particularly true for renal diseases caused by infections as in viral diseases. In this review, we highlight the inflammatory mechanisms that underlie kidney dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2, human immunodeficiency (HIV), hepatitis C (HCV), and hepatitis B (HBV) infections. The pathophysiology of renal involvement in COVID-19 is complex, but kidney damage is frequent, and the prognosis is worse when it happens. Virus-like particles were demonstrated mostly in renal tubular epithelial cells and podocytes, which suggest that SARS-CoV-2 directly affects the kidneys. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which is found in endothelial cells, to infect the human host cells. Critical patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) show an increase in inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-8, IFN-γ, TNF-α), known as cytokine storm that favors renal dysfunction by causing intrarenal inflammation, increased vascular permeability, volume depletion, thromboembolic events in microvasculature and persistent local inflammation. Besides AKI, SARS-CoV-2 can also cause glomerular disease, as other viral infections such as in HIV, HBV and HCV. HIV-infected patients present chronic inflammation that can lead to a number of renal diseases. Proinflammatory cytokines and TNF-induced apoptosis are some of the underlying mechanisms that may explain the virus-induced renal diseases that are here reviewed.","da Mata, Gustavo Ferreira; Fernandes, Danilo Euclides; Luciano, Eduardo de Paiva; Sales, Gabriel Teixeira Montezuma; Riguetti, Michelle Tiveron Passos; Kirsztajn, Gianna Mastroianni",J Venom Anim Toxins Incl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-9199-jvatitd-2020-0154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34381495/,478

Initial studies of this binding site indicate that it is not expressed in the adrenal, liver or kidney of the rat and mouse. To determine if this binding site occurs in other mouse tissues, 8 tissues were assayed for expression of this binding site by radioligand binding assay and compared with the expression of this binding site in the forebrain. Particulate fractions of homogenates of testis, epididymis, seminal vesicles, heart, spleen, pancreas, lung, skeletal muscle, and forebrain were incubated with (125)I-sarcosine(1), isoleucine(8) angiotensin II in the presence or absence of 0.3 mM parachloromercuribenzoate plus 10 µM losartan and 10 µM PD123319 (to saturate AT(1) and AT(2) receptors). Specific (3 µM angiotensin II displaceable) high affinity binding occurred in the testis > forebrain > epididymis > spleen > pancreas > lung when parachloromercuribenzoate was present. Binding could not be reliably observed in heart, skeletal muscle and seminal vesicles. High affinity binding of (125)I-sarcosine(1), isoleucine(8) angiotensin II was observed in the absence of parachloromercuribenzoate in the pancreas on occasion. This suggests that this novel angiotensin binding site may have a functional role in these tissues.","Rabey, Felicia M.; Karamyan, Vardan T.; Speth, Robert C.",Regul Pept,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.regpep.2010.02.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20171994/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167011510000431; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167011510000431,478
618379,Vitiligo in a COVID‐19‐vaccinated patient with ulcerative colitis: coincidence?,2021-08-03,"We describe the first genome isolation of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Kenya. This fatal zoonotic pathogen was first described in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012. Epidemiological and molecular evidence revealed zoonotic transmission from camels to humans and between humans. Currently, MERS-CoV is classified by the WHO as having high pandemic potential requiring greater surveillance. Previous studies of MERS-CoV in Kenya mainly focused on site-specific and archived camel and human serum samples for antibodies. We conducted active nationwide cross-sectional surveillance of camels and humans in Kenya, targeting both nasal swabs and plasma samples from 1,163 camels and 486 humans collected from January 2016 to June 2018. A total of 792 camel plasma samples were positive by ELISA. Seroprevalence increased with age, and the highest prevalence was observed in adult camels (82.37%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 79.50–84.91). More female camels were significantly seropositive (74.28%, 95% CI 71.14–77.19) than male camels (P < 0.001) (53.74%, 95% CI 48.48–58.90). Only 11 camel nasal swabs were positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences showed that Kenyan MERS-CoV clustered within sub-clade C2, which is associated with the African clade, but did not contain signature deletions of orf4b in African viruses. None of the human plasma screened contained neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV. This study confirms the geographically widespread occurrence of MERS-CoV in Kenyan camels. Further one-health surveillance approaches in camels, wildlife, and human populations are needed.

618595,COVID-19 Critical Illness: A Data-Driven Review,2021,"IMPORTANCE: Patients with cancer undergoing treatment are at high risk of COVID-19 following SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, their ability to produce an adequate antibody response to messenger RNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate rates of antispike (anti-S) antibody response to a BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with cancer who are undergoing systemic treatment vs healthy controls. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study included 102 adult patients with solid tumors undergoing active intravenous anticancer treatment and 78 controls who received the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine at least 12 days before enrollment. The controls were taken from a convenience sample of the patients’ family/caregivers who accompanied them to treatment. The study was conducted between February 22, 2021, and March 15, 2021 at Davidoff Cancer Center at Beilinson Hospital (Petah Tikva, Israel). INTERVENTIONS: Blood samples were drawn from the study participants. Serum samples were analyzed and the titers of the IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor–binding domain were determined using a commercially available immunoassay. Seropositivity was defined as 50 or greater AU/mL. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the rate of seropositivity. Secondary outcomes included comparisons of IgG titers and identifying factors that were associated with seropositivity using univariate/multivariable analyses. RESULTS: The analysis included 180 participants, which comprised 102 patients with cancer (median [interquartile range (IQR)] age, 66 [56-72] years; 58 men [57%]) and 78 healthy controls (median [IQR] age, 62 [49-70] years; 25 men [32%]). The most common tumor type was gastrointestinal (29 [28%]). In the patient group, 92 (90%) were seropositive for SARS-CoV 2 antispike IgG antibodies after the second vaccine dose, whereas in the control group, all were seropositive. The median IgG titer in the patients with cancer was significantly lower than that in the controls (1931 [IQR, 509-4386] AU/mL vs 7160 [IQR, 3129-11 241] AU/mL; P < .001). In a multivariable analysis, the only variable that was significantly associated with lower IgG titers was treatment with chemotherapy plus immunotherapy (β, −3.5; 95% CI, −5.6 to −1.5). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients with cancer who were receiving active systemic therapy, 90% of patients exhibited adequate antibody response to the BNT162b2 vaccine, although their antibody titers were significantly lower than those of healthy controls. Further research into the clinical relevance of lower titers and their durability is required. Nonetheless, the data support vaccinating patients with cancer as a high priority, even during therapy.","Massarweh, Amir; Eliakim-Raz, Noa; Stemmer, Amos; Levy-Barda, Adva; Yust-Katz, Shlomit; Zer, Alona; Benouaich-Amiel, Alexandra; Ben-Zvi, Haim; Moskovits, Neta; Brenner, Baruch; Bishara, Jihad; Yahav, Dafna; Tadmor, Boaz; Zaks, Tal; Stemmer, Salomon M.",JAMA Oncology,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/articlepdf/2780584/jamaoncology_massarweh_2021_oi_210032_1621981705.00045.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2021.2155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047765/,478

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor can bind to spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Then, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can be cleaved and activated by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) of the host cells for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are potential antiviral targets for treatment of prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we discovered that 10−250 μg/mL of GB-2, from Tian Shang Sheng Mu of Chiayi Puzi Peitian Temple, can inhibit ACE2 mRNA expression and ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein expression in HepG2 and 293 T cells without cytotoxicity. GB-2 treatment could decrease ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression level of lung tissue and kidney tissue without adverse effects, including nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, in animal model. In the compositions of GB-2, we discovered that 50 μg/mL of theaflavin could inhibit protein expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Theaflavin could inhibit the mRNA expression of ACE2. In conclusion, our results suggest that GB-2 and theaflavin could act as potential compounds for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 inhibitors in the further clinical study.","Wu, Ching-Yuan; Lin, Yu-Shih; Yang, Yao-Hsu; Shu, Li-Hsin; Cheng, Yu-Ching; Liu, Hung Te",Biomed Pharmacother,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S075333222031009X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33049583/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110816; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S075333222031009X,478

Although the COVID-19 vaccines effectively prevent infection, yet some cases of infections have been reported post-vaccination, raising concerns about their efficacy and safety. This study was aimed to investigate the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the symptomatic-vaccinated healthcare workers (HCWs) and to analyze the severity of their disease. Methods This retrospective study was done at a single multispecialty hospital, on the HCWs who have had COVID-19 vaccination, during the initial period of the vaccination drive (January 16 to April 24, 2021). The symptomatic post-vaccination infections in these HCWs were evaluated. Results Eighty five of 3235 (2.63%) vaccinated HCWs acquired the SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination, during the study period. Of these, 65 (76.5%) were fully vaccinated (FV), and 20 (23.5%) were partially vaccinated (PV) and the protection rate of vaccination was 97.4 per cent [95 % confidence interval (CI)=96.8-97.9]. The odds ratio of acquiring infection among females was higher at 1.84 (95% CI=1.17-2.88; P=0.008) mainly because of their greater involvement in the patient care as nursing personnel. The chances of infections were the highest in the medical and nursing personnel, as compared to paramedical, administrative and supporting staff (P<0.001). Among the HCWs studied, only two required hospitalization (0.06%), none needed an intensive care unit (ICU) admission and there were no deaths. Interpretation & conclusions The COVID-19 infection after vaccination occurred in a smaller subset (2.63%) of HCWs, in both PV and the FV groups. These infections were primarily minor and did not lead to severe disease. Overall, the vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (recombinant) prevented SARS-CoV-2 severe infection in the HCWs, leading to ICU admission and deaths.""","Vaishya, Raju; Sibal, Anupam; Malani, Arpita; Hari Prasad, K",The Indian journal of medical research,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_1485_21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34341227/,478

Accordingly, many aviation stakeholders put hopes into the ongoing process of vaccination, with the expectation that a high degree of vaccination will push the envelope for a return to normalcy. One prerequisite for reviving international air connectivity is the introduction of verification documents, also called “vaccination passports”. These passports, however, come with several challenges which need to be overcome in order to enable recovery. In this study, we propose a framework covering five important aspects and policy challenges concerning the introduction of vaccination passports for a return of aviation, covering the topics: Competition, Epidemiology, Technology, Ethics, and Politics.

We carried out this external pilot study on 38 patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 to test the effect pentoxifylline on parameters such as LDH, lymphocyte count, days of hospitalization, mortality, and proportion of patients requiring intubation. Twenty-six patients were randomized to receive 400 mg of pentoxifylline t.i.d. plus standard therapy (pentoxifylline group), while the rest received the standard treatment (control group). Linear regression models were built for statistically significant parameters. Pentoxifylline treatment was associated with a 64.25% increase (CI95% 11.83, 116.68) in lymphocyte count and a 29.61% decrease (CI95% 15.11, 44.10) in serum LDH. Although a trend towards reduced days of hospitalization, mortality, and proportion of patients requiring intubation was observed, no statistically significant difference was found for these parameters. Our findings open the possibility of pentoxifylline being repositioned as a drug for COVID-19 treatment with the advantages of a proven safety profile, availability, and no risk of immunosuppression; however, this evidence needs to be confirmed in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.","Maldonado, Valente; Hernandez-Ramírez, Claudia; Alonso Oliva-Pérez, Eniel; Omar Sánchez-Martínez, César; Fabián Pimentel-González, Jorge; Raúl Molina-Sánchez, José; Zuyenn Jiménez-Villalba, Yeimmy; Chávez-Alderete, Jaime; Loza-Mejía, Marco A.",Int Immunopharmacol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576920336766; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576920336766?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33278747/,478

We found that the surface of sport balls, notably a football, tennis ball, golf ball, and cricket ball could not harbour inactivated virus when it was swabbed onto the surface, even for 30 seconds. However, when high concentrations of 5,000 dC/mL and 10,000 dC/mL are directly pipetted onto the balls, it could be detected after for short time periods. Sports objects can only harbour inactivated SARS-CoV-2 under specific, directly transferred conditions, but wiping with a dry tissue or moist ‘baby wipe’ or dropping and rolling the balls removes all detectable viral traces. This has helpful implications to sporting events.","Pelisser, Michel; Thompson, Joe; Majra, Dasha; Youhanna, Sonia; Stebbing, Justin; Davies, Peter",Public health in practice,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666535220300288; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhip.2020.100029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173569/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666535220300288?v=s5,478

We aimed to explore the utility of patient-held data during presentation as medical emergencies. METHODS: We undertook a systematic scoping review of two groups of studies: studies using non-invasive vital sign monitoring in patients with chronic diseases aimed at preventing unscheduled reviews in primary care, hospitalization or emergency department visits and studies using vital sign measurements from wearable sensors for decision making by clinicians on presentation of these patients as emergencies. Only studies that described a comparator or control group were included. Studies limited to inpatient use of devices were excluded. RESULTS: The initial search resulted in 896 references for screening, nine more studies were identified through searches of references. 26 studies fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria and were further analyzed. The majority of studies were from telehealth programs of patients with congestive heart failure or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. There was limited evidence that patient held data is currently used to risk-stratify the admission or discharge process for medical emergencies. Studies that showed impact on mortality or hospital admission rates measured vital signs at least daily. We identified no interventional study using commercially available sensors in watches or smart phones. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to determine utility of patient held monitoring devices to guide management of acute medical emergencies at the patients’ home, on presentation to hospital and after discharge back to the community.","Hamza, Muhammad; Alsma, Jelmer; Kellett, John; Brabrand, Mikkel; Christensen, Erika F.; Cooksley, Tim; Haak, Harm R.; Nanayakkara, Prabath W.B.; Merten, Hanneke; Schouten, Bo; Weichert, Immo; Subbe, Christian P.",Resusc Plus,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666520421000412; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resplu.2021.100116; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666520421000412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870237/,478

In this study, we evaluated the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in a cohort of 963 recovered individuals over a period of 10 months. Investigating a total of 2,146 samples, we detected an initial SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in 94.4% of individuals, with 82% and 79% exhibiting serum and IgG neutralization, respectively. Approximately 3% of recovered patients demonstrated exceptional SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity, defining them as ‘elite neutralizers’. These individuals also possessed effective cross-neutralizing IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-1 without any known prior exposure to this virus. By applying multivariate statistical modeling, we found that sero-reactivity, age, time since disease onset, and fever are key factors predicting SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity in mild courses of COVID-19. Investigating longevity of the antibody response, we detected loss of anti-spike reactivity in 13% of individuals 10 months after infection. Moreover, neutralizing activity had an initial half-life of 6.7 weeks in serum versus 30.8 weeks in purified IgG samples indicating the presence of a more stable and long-term memory IgG B cell repertoire in the majority of individuals recovered from COVID-19. Our results demonstrate a broad spectrum of the initial SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response depending on clinical characteristics, with antibodies being maintained in the majority of individuals for the first 10 months after mild course of COVID-19.","Vanshylla, Kanika; Di Cristanziano, Veronica; Kleipass, Franziska; Dewald, Felix; Schommers, Philipp; Gieselmann, Lutz; Gruell, Henning; Schlotz, Maike; Ercanoglu, Meryem S; Stumpf, Ricarda; Mayer, Petra; Heger, Eva; Johannis, Wibke; Horn, Carola; Suárez, Isabelle; Jung, Norma; Salomon, Susanne; Eberhardt, Kirsten Alexandra; Fätkenheuer, Gerd; Pfeifer, Nico; Eggeling, Ralf; Augustin, Max; Lehmann, Clara; Klein, Florian",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.26.428207,478
623958,Epidemiology of COVID-19 infection amongst workers in Primary Healthcare in Qatar,2021-02-18,"BACKGROUND: Patients in Germany are free to seek care from any office-based physician and can always ask for multiple opinions on a diagnosis or treatment. The high density of physicians and the freedom to choose among them without referrals have led to a need for better coordination between the multiple health professionals treating any given patient. The objectives of this study are to (1) identify informal networks of physicians who treat the same patient population, (2) provide these physicians with feedback on their network and patients, using routine data and (3) give the physicians the opportunity to meet one another in facilitated network meetings. METHODS: The Accountable Care Deutschland (ACD) study is a prospective, non-blinded, cluster-randomised trial comprising a process and economic evaluation of informal networks among 12,525 GPs and office-based specialists and their 1.9 million patients. The units of allocation are the informal networks, which will be randomised either to the intervention (feedback and facilitated meetings) or control group (usual care). The informal networks will be generated by identifying connections between office-based physicians using complete datasets from the Regional Associations of Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) Physicians in Hamburg, Schleswig Holstein, North Rhine and Westphalia Lip, as well as data from three large statutory health insurers in Germany. The physicians will (a) receive feedback on selected indicators of their own treatment activity and that of the colleagues in their network and (b) will be invited to voluntary, facilitated network meetings by their Regional Association of SHI physicians. The primary outcome will be ambulatory-care-sensitive hospitalisations at baseline, at the end of the 2-year intervention period, and at six months and at 12 months after the end of the intervention period. Data will be analysed using the intention-to-treat principle. A pilot study preceded the ACD study. DISCUSSION: Cochrane reviews show that feedback can improve everyday medical practice by shedding light on previously unknown relationships. Providing physicians with information on how they are connected with their colleagues and what the outcomes are of care delivered within their informal networks can help them make these improvements, as well as strengthen their awareness of possible discontinuities in the care they provide.

623978,The BTK inhibitor ibrutinib may protect against pulmonary injury in COVID-19–infected patients,2020-05-21,"Scytovirin is a lectin isolated from the cyanobacterium Scytonema varium that has shown activity against HIV, SARS coronavirus and Zaire Ebola virus. Its 95 amino acids are divided into two structural domains (SD), the first spanning amino acids 1–48 (SD1) and the second 49–95 (SD2). Interestingly, the domains are nearly identical but differ in their affinities for carbohydrates. With the aim of enhancing understanding of the binding properties of scytovirin, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of scytovirin complexed with Man4. We set up three systems: (i) Man4 bound to both domains (SD1 + SD2) using the full-length protein; (ii) Man4 bound to an incomplete protein, containing only SD1 and (iii) Man4 bound to an incomplete protein containing only SD2. Contrary to other reports, binding free energy results suggest that Man4 can bind simultaneously to SD1 and SD2 binding regions, but SD1 individually has the best values of energy and the best affinity for Man4. Decomposition of the binding free energy showed that the residues that interact with Man4 were different in the three systems, suggesting that the binding mechanism of Man4 varies between full-length protein, SD1 and SD2. The results presented here may help to formulate strategies to use scytovirin and promote mutagenesis studies to improve the antiviral activity of scytovirin.","Siqueira, Andrei Santos; Lima, Alex Ranieri Jerônimo; de Souza, Rafael Conceição; Santos, Alberdan Silva; Vianez Júnior, João Lídio da Silva Gonçalves; Gonçalves, Evonnildo Costa",Mol Biol Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-017-4116-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28756560/,478

Nanodiagnostics uses biosensor technology which is one of the most promising, compact systems consisting of a composite analysis of biological recognition element. Detecting an analyte (glucose, antibiotics, etc.) using a transducer element or detector element to quantify the amount of analyte is the working principle of biosensors. The transducer or the detector element transforms the signal resulting from the interaction of the analyte with the biological element into another signal that can be more easily measured and quantified. Nanobiotechnology scientists have also successfully produced microchips that are coated with biological molecules. The chip is designed to emit an electrical impulse signal when the molecules detect signs of a disease. Special sensor nanobots can be inserted into the blood under the skin where they can check blood contents and warn of any possible diseases. They can also be used to monitor the sugar level in the blood. Advantages of using such nanobots are that they are very cheap to produce and are easily portable.","Mehta, M.; Subramani, K.",Emerging Nanotechnologies in Dentistry,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9781455778621000213; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781455778621000213,478

625255,Letter to the Editor: Transneural transmission in COVID-19 without a positive nasopharyngeal swab,2020-09-12,"Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus persists in cultures of a subline (designated LM-K) of mouse LM cells but produces a lytic infection in L-2 cells. Persistence in the LM-K cells was not accompanied by production of is mutants or of soluble anti-MHV factors. Infectious center assay demonstrated an approximately 500-fold lower level of infectibility by MHV of the LM-K cells as compared to L-2 cells. On an infected cell basis, production levels of infectious progeny and viral RNA were comparable between the two cell lines. The extent of virus-induced cell-cell fusion, however, was markedly reduced in the LM-K cells. Cell-mixing experiments showed that both infected L-2 and LM-K cells have the capacity of fusing with neighboring uninfected L-2 cells but not with uninfected LM-K cells. This suggests that the decreased level of fusion observed in the LM-K infection is due not to absence of viral fusion protein at the cell surface, but rather to an inherent resistance of the LM-K cell membrane to MHV-induced fusion. It is believed that such fusion resistance in LM-K cells moderates virus dissemination throughout the culture, thereby contributing to a state of virus persistence.","Mizzen, Lee; Cheley, Steve; Rao, Meena; Wolf, Robert; Anderson, Robert",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682283902660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6310865/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682283902660,478

We evaluated the performance of five commercial SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays to inform their use in serosurveys in Nigeria. Four semiquantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein [NCP] immunoglobulin G [IgG], Euroimmun spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Mologic Omega COVID-19 IgG, Bio-Rad Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab) and one chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG) were evaluated. We estimated the analytical performance characteristics using plasma from 100 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients from varied time points post-PCR confirmation and 100 prepandemic samples (50 HIV positive and 50 hepatitis B positive). The Bio-Rad assay failed the manufacturer-specified validation steps. The Euroimmun NCP, Euroimmun spike, and Mologic assays had sensitivities of 73.7%, 74.4%, and 76.9%, respectively, on samples taken 15 to 58 days after PCR confirmation and specificities of 97%, 100%, and 83.8%, respectively. The Abbott assay had 71.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity on the same panel. Parallel or serial algorithms combining two tests did not substantially improve the sensitivity or specificity. Our results showed lower sensitivity and, for one immunoassay, lower specificity compared to the manufacturers' results and other reported validations. Seroprevalence estimates using these assays might need to be interpreted with caution in Nigeria and similar settings. These findings highlight the importance of in-country validations of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays prior to use to ensure that accurate results are available for public health decision-making to control the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. IMPORTANCE This study used positive and negative sample panels from Nigeria to test the performance of several commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. Using these prepandemic and SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, we found much lower levels of sensitivity in four commercially available assays than most assay manufacturer reports and independent evaluations. The use of these assays with suboptimal sensitivity and specificity in Nigeria or countries with population exposure to similar endemic pathogens could lead to a biased estimate of the seroprevalence, over- or underestimating the true disease prevalence, and limit efforts to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2. It is important to conduct in-country validations of serological SARS-CoV-2 assays prior to their widespread use, especially in countries with limited representation in published assay validations.","Ige, Fehintola; Hamada, Yohhei; Steinhardt, Laura; Iriemenam, Nnaemeka C; Uwandu, Mabel; Greby, Stacie Marta; Aniedobe, Maureen; Salako, Babatunde Lawal; Rangaka, Molebogeng X; Abubakar, Ibrahim; Audu, Rosemary",Microbiol Spectr,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00680-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34612691/,478

The aim was to compare both modalities for detection of pulmonary infections and to explore performance of low-dose computed tomography for early detection of invasive fungal disease. The low-dose computed tomography remained blinded during the study. A consensus diagnosis of the fever episode made by an expert panel was used as reference standard. We included 67 consecutive patients on the first day of febrile neutropenia. According to the consensus diagnosis 11 patients (16.4%) had pulmonary infections. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 36%, 93%, 50% and 88% for radiography, and 73%, 91%, 62% and 94% for low-dose computed tomography, respectively. An uncorrected McNemar showed no statistical difference (p = 0.197). Mean radiation dose for low-dose computed tomography was 0.24 mSv. Four out of 5 included patients diagnosed with invasive fungal disease had radiographic abnormalities suspect for invasive fungal disease on the low-dose computed tomography scan made on day 1 of fever, compared to none of the chest radiographs. We conclude that chest radiography has little value in the initial assessment of febrile neutropenia on day 1 for detection of pulmonary abnormalities. Low-dose computed tomography improves detection of pulmonary infiltrates and seems capable of detecting invasive fungal disease at a very early stage with a low radiation dose.","Gerritsen, M.

625963,Impact of COVID-19 on Patients Undergoing Scheduled Hemodialysis Operations,2021-09-30,"Two common viral pathogens of swine, namely, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), were investigated in regard to their effects on monolayer cultures of swine alveolar macrophages (AMs). The purpose was to identify selected cellular changes and responses potentially associated with the clinical reactions of pigs infected with either or both of these viruses. Measurements included the (1) absolute and relative numbers of infected, viable, and apoptotic cells; (2) distribution of viral antigens; (3) levels of interferon-alpha (IFN-α) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) produced and their association with the extent of virus-induced cytopathology. Four groups of AMs were studied, including mock-infected, PCV2 alone-infected (PCV2-A), PRRSV alone-infected (PRRSV-A), and PCV2 and PRRSV dually infected (PCV2/PRRSV) groups. The AMs of PCV2-A group had high antigen-containing rate without cell death. There was a marked increase in cell death and apoptosis in PRRSV-A group. However, a lower PRRSV-induced infectious rate, cell death, and apoptosis were seen in PCV2/PRRSV group. High levels of IFN-α production were detected in PCV2-infected groups, but not in mock-infected and PRRSV-A groups. The PRRSV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) on MARC-145 cells or swine AMs was markedly reduced by pre-incubation of the cells with UV-treated or non-UV-treated supernatants of PCV2-infected AMs. In addition, the reduction in CPE was abolished when the supernatants of PCV2-infected AMs were pre-treated with a mouse anti-recombinant porcine IFN-α antibody. The results suggest that swine AMs were an important reservoir of PCV2; PCV2 infection reduced PRRSV infection and PRRSV-associated CPE in PCV2/PRRSV AMs; the reduction of PRRSV infection in AMs was mediated by IFN-α generated by PCV2 infection. The reduced PRRSV-associated CPE in AMs and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production may lead to a more severe pneumonic lesion in those dually infected pigs.","Chang, Hui-Wen; Jeng, Chian-Ren; Liu, Jiuan J.; Lin, Tsang-Long; Chang, Chih-Cheng; Chia, Mi-Yuan; Tsai, Yi-Chieh; Pang, Victor F.",Vet Microbiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113505001161; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113505001161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15936905/,478

Since the beginning of the pandemic, a previously unseen change in terms of procedures, organization of patient flow, and personal protective equipment (PPE) employed led to a reorganization of all the aspects of patient management. The aim of the present study was to report and compare current dental activity with pre-COVID era. METHODS Data on the dental activity in the period 9th March - 9th September 2020 were retrieved and compared with the same period of the previous year. The differences with pre-COVID era in terms of patient schedule and PPE were evaluated using Student t-test for independent data. Significance was set at p<0.05. RESULTS During the lockdown, dental activity was reduced by almost the 90%, although emergencies and urgent treatments were still performed in a high number of patients. In the six months comprised between March and September 2020, the overall activity decreased by the 50% compared to the same period of the previous year. The access to the department was modified in order to guarantee a safe patient flow. Triage and temperature measurement were performed in all patients to exclude both the presence of symptoms and potential contact with infected subjects. Moreover, appointments were scheduled every 45 minutes, and the waiting rooms reorganized. A higher number of PPE items was employed by dental health care workers.

627183,Clinicians’ Feedback on Patient/Carer Experience After Switching of Growth Hormone Treatment in Pediatric Patients During COVID-19,2021-09-21,"Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) are blood preparations pooled from the plasma of donors that have been first employed as replacement therapy in immunodeficiency. IVIG interact at multiple levels with the different components of the immune system and exert their activity against infections. Passive immunotherapy includes convalescent plasma from subjects who have recovered from infection, hyperimmune globulin formulations with a high titer of neutralizing antibodies, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). IVIG are used for the prevention and treatment of several infections, especially in immunocompromised patients, or in case of a poorly responsive immune system. The evolution of IVIG from a source of passive immunity to a powerful immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory agent results in extensive applications in autoimmune diseases. IVIG composition depends on the antibodies of the donor population and the alterations of protein structure due to the processing of plasma. The anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activity of IVIG has led us to think that they may represent a useful therapeutic tool even in COVID-19. The human origin of IVIG carries specific criticalities including risks of blood products, supply, and elevated costs.

Monitoring for risk factors and preventing dangerous behaviors that increase melanoma risk, such as tanning, are important measures for melanoma prevention. Additionally, assessing the effectiveness of various methods to prevent sun exposure and sunburns—which can lead to melanoma—is important to help identify ways to reduce the development of melanoma. We summarize the recent evidence regarding the heritable and behavioral risks underlying melanoma, as well as the current methods used to reduce the risk of developing melanoma and to improve the diagnosis of this disease. ABSTRACT: (1) Melanoma is the most aggressive dermatologic malignancy, with an estimated 106,110 new cases to be diagnosed in 2021. The annual incidence rates continue to climb, which underscores the critical importance of improving the methods to prevent this disease. The interventions to assist with melanoma prevention vary and typically include measures such as UV avoidance and the use of protective clothing, sunscreen, and other chemopreventive agents. However, the evidence is mixed surrounding the use of these and other interventions. This review discusses the heritable etiologies underlying melanoma development before delving into the data surrounding the preventive methods highlighted above. (2) A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify the clinical trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses pertinent to melanoma prevention and incidence. Online resources were queried to identify epidemiologic and clinical trial information. (3) Evidence exists to support population-wide screening programs, the proper use of sunscreen, and community-targeted measures in the prevention of melanoma. Clinical evidence for the majority of the proposed preventive chemotherapeutics is presently minimal but continues to evolve. (4) Further study of these chemotherapeutics, as well as improvement of techniques in artificial intelligence and imaging techniques for melanoma screening, is warranted for continued improvement of melanoma prevention.","Djavid, Amir Reza; Stonesifer, Connor; Fullerton, Benjamin T.; Wang, Samuel W.; Tartaro, Marlene A.; Kwinta, Bradley D.; Grimes, Joseph M.; Geskin, Larisa J.; Saenger, Yvonne M.",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34638397/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13194914,478

627820,Lymphocyte Changes in Severe COVID-19: Delayed Over-Activation of STING?,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND: Cruise travel contributed to SARS-CoV-2 transmission when there were relatively few cases in the United States. By March 14, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a No Sail Order suspending U.S. cruise operations; the last U.S. passenger ship docked on April 16. METHODS: We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on cruises in U.S. waters or carrying U.S. citizens and used regression models to compare voyage characteristics. We used compartmental models to simulate the potential impact of four interventions (screening for COVID-19 symptoms; viral testing on two days and isolation of positive persons; reduction of passengers by 40%, crew by 20%, and port visits to one) for 7-day and 14-day voyages. RESULTS: During January 19–April 16, 2020, 89 voyages on 70 ships had known SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks; 16 ships had recurrent outbreaks. There were 1,669 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 29 confirmed deaths. Longer voyages were associated with more cases (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.17, p < 0.0001). Mathematical models showed that 7-day voyages had about 70% fewer cases than 14-day voyages. On 7-day voyages, the most effective interventions were reducing the number of individuals onboard (43-49% reduction in total infections) and testing passengers and crew (42-43% reduction in total infections). All four interventions reduced transmission by 80%, but no single intervention or combination eliminated transmission. Results were similar for 14-day voyages. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on cruises were common during January-April 2020. Despite all interventions modeled, cruise travel still poses a significant SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk.","Guagliardo, Sarah Anne J; Prasad, Pragati V; Rodriguez, Andrea; Fukunaga, Rena; Novak, Ryan T; Ahart, Lauren; Reynolds, Jared; Griffin, Isabel; Wiegand, Ryan; Quilter, Laura A S; Morrison, Stephanie; Jenkins, Keisha; Wall, Hilary K; Treffiletti, Aimee; White, Stefanie B; Regan, Joanna; Tardivel, Kara; Freeland, Amy; Brown, Clive; Wolford, Hannah; Johansson, Michael A; Cetron, Martin S; Slayton, Rachel B; Friedman, Cindy R",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33978720/,478

Although human disease is often asymptomatic, some develop severe illnesses such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death. There is an urgent need for a vaccine to prevent its rapid spread as asymptomatic infections accounting for up to 40% of transmission events. Here we further evaluated an inactivated rabies vectored SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine CORAVAX in a Syrian hamster model. CORAVAX adjuvanted with MPLA-AddaVax, a TRL4 agonist, induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and generated a strong Th1-biased immune response. Vaccinated hamsters were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs and nasal turbinates three days after challenge with SARS-CoV-2. CORAVAX also prevented lung disease, as indicated by the significant reduction in lung pathology. This study highlights CORAVAX as a safe, immunogenic, and efficacious vaccine that warrants further assessment in human trials.","Kurup, Drishya; Malherbe, Delphine C.; Wirblich, Christoph; Lambert, Rachael; Ronk, Adam J.; Diba, Leila Zabihi; Bukreyev, Alexander; Schnell, Matthias J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.19.427373,478

Public transportation is not only a bridge through which infections travel from one location to another but also a place where infections occur since individuals are typically in close proximity to each other due to the limited space in these systems. A mathematical model is constructed to study the spread of an infectious disease through such systems. A variant of the next generation method is proposed and used to provide upper and lower bounds of the basic reproduction number for the model. Our investigation indicates that increasing transportation efficiency, and improving sanitation and ventilation of the public transportation system decrease the chance of an outbreak occurring. Moreover, discouraging unnecessary travel during an epidemic also decreases the chance of an outbreak. However, reducing travel by infectives while allowing susceptibles to travel may not be enough to avoid an outbreak.","Xu, Fei; Connell McCluskey, C.; Cressman, Ross",Math Biosci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2013.08.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24018293/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556413002162; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556413002162,478

Although researches into the production of relevant vaccine are being advanced, there is, however, a need for a computational solution to mediate the process of aiding quick detection of the disease. Different computational solutions comprised of natural language processing, knowledge engineering and deep learning have been adopted for this task. However, deep learning solutions have shown interesting performance compared to other methods. This paper therefore aims to advance the application deep learning technique to the problem of characterization and detection of novel coronavirus. The approach adopted in this study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model which is further enhanced using the technique of data augmentation. The motive for the enhancement of the CNN model through the latter technique is to investigate the possibility of further improving the performances of deep learning models in detection of coronavirus. The proposed model is then applied to the COVID-19 X-ray dataset in this study which is the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Chest X-Ray dataset obtained from Kaggle for the purpose of promoting early detection and screening of coronavirus disease. Results obtained showed that our approach achieved a performance of 100% accuracy, recall/precision of 0.85, F-measure of 0.9, and specificity of 1.0. The proposed CNN model and data augmentation solution may be adopted in pre-screening suspected cases of Covid19 to provide support to the use of the well-known RT-PCR testing.","Oyelade, O.

Based on these estimates, this work allows us to accurately re-estimate the lethality of the disease in Spain, taking into account unreported cases. A hierarchical Bayesian model recently proposed in the literature has been adapted to model the actual number of Covid-19 cases in Spain. The results of this work show that the real load of Covid-19 in Spain in the period considered is well above the data registered by the public health system. Specifically, the model estimates show that, cumulatively until June 1st, 2020, there were 2,425,930 cases of Covid-19 in Spain with characteristics similar to those reported (95\% credibility interval: 2,148,261 - 2,813,864), from which were actually registered only 518,664. Considering the results obtained from the second wave of the Spanish seroprevalence study, which estimates 2,350,324 cases of Covid-19 produced in Spain, in the period of time considered, it can be seen that the estimates provided by the model are quite good.

Arthritis patients are a vulnerable population at an increased risk of peritraumatic stress. This could be due to several reasons, including the fear of shortage of medicine and difficulty receiving periodical medical checks. In the present case-control study, psychological distress in patients with autoimmune arthritis during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic were investigated. An electronic survey was conducted to gather information on the perceived change in the emotional state, general health (GH), fatigue, joint pain, and disease activity during the lockdown, in 100 patients with autoimmune arthritis and 100 controls. Mental health status was measured using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) was used to assess the frequency of peritraumatic stress disorders related to COVID-19. Patients reported a significant worsening of perceived GH (36% vs. 7%; p < 0.001), a significantly higher mean CPDI score (p < 0.001) than controls. Using multivariate analysis, arthritis patients had significantly higher CPDI scores (+3.67 points; p = 0.019), independent of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, comorbidities, and sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of reporting worsened GH was 9-fold higher in patients than controls (p < 0.001). Patients with autoimmune arthritis are at higher risk of psychological distress related to COVID-19 pandemic; thus targeted intervention should be designed to strengthen coping capacity in this vulnerable population.","Picchianti Diamanti, Andrea; Cattaruzza, Maria Sofia; Di Rosa, Roberta; Del Porto, Flavia; Salemi, Simonetta; Sorgi, Maria Laura; Martin Martin, Luis Severino; Rai, Alessandra; Iacono, Dalila; Sesti, Giorgio; Alessandri, Guido; Laganà, Bruno",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33218124/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8111818,478

Eight trials were included. No one was in favour for controlled arm about main endpoint of death or mechanical ventilation incidence at day 28–30. Five trials on heterogenous populations seem to not demonstrate tocilizumab efficacy, but showed encouraging results in subgroup analysis on severe/critical patients (in favour for tocilizumab). Trials on severe/critical COVID‐19 pneumonia as REMAP‐CAP and RECOVERY showed mortality benefit of tocilizumab administration; CORIMUNO, REMAP‐CAP and RECOVERY showed that tocilizumab decreased the incidence of mechanical ventilation. No safety signal about tocilizumab used was noticed in all trials. We concluded that tocilizumab reduces mortality and mechanical ventilation requirement if administered with the right timing in COVID‐19 pneumonia. The challenge now is to define the optimal group and timing for tocilizumab benefit and we suggest that: (i) tocilizumab has a place in treatment of severe/critical COVID‐19 pneumonia, with a high level of O(2) flow or noninvasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula; (ii) possibly early after intubation in patients on mechanical ventilation. Initiating tocilizumab in critically ill patients early before irreversible respiratory failure, especially in patients at an inflammatory stage could be the key to successful outcome.","Klopfenstein, Timothée; Gendrin, Vincent; Kadiane‐Oussou, N'dri Juliette; Conrozier, Thierry; Zayet, Souheil",Rev Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882179/; https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2239,478

The use of social media by public health authorities has helped to reduce these threats by increasing effective risk communication between the government and the public. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to reveal how China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses social media to improve three aspects of health communication between the government and the public: adoption, operation, and interaction. METHODS: To analyze the 134 CDC government Weibo accounts at the provincial- and prefecture-level administration regions in mainland China, we collected their account data and extracted 1215 Weibo tweets. We also supplemented the data to reveal the overall performance of the CDC’s government Weibo use during the COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS: The registration rate of the CDC’s government Weibo accounts increased year by year, and the local authorities registered Weibo accounts before the central government authorities. In total, 29.8% (n=134) of the 450 CDC facilities have registered an account. Among the 134 CDC facilities that have registered Weibo accounts, the registration rate in the eastern region (n=68, 50.7%) was higher than those in the central region (n=30, 22.4%) and the western region (n=36, 26.9%). Nearly 90.0% of these Weibo accounts had official certification, but there were dropouts in the specific operating process. One-third of the accounts have not been updated for more than 1 year, and the number of Weibo followers was polarized, with a maximum and minimum difference of 1 million. The response rate to users’ comments was less than 1%. Emergency information, multimedia content, and original content were more helpful in promoting communication between the government and the public. Such interaction was partially improved during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDC updated the daily epidemic situation and provided popular science information for epidemic prevention and control for the public in a timely manner. CONCLUSIONS: China’s CDC is using more social media to popularize daily health information and has taken the first step to improve communication between the government and the public. However, equal dialogue, two-way interactions, and effective communication with the public still need improvement.","Zeng, Runxi; Li, Menghan",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33151892/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19470,478
630586,Hypocalcemia: the quest for the cause of a major biochemical feature of COVID-19,2020-10-22,"Background: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is highly contagious and causes substantial morbidity and mortality. Mask usage has been advocated by health professionals to minimize its spread. Thus, it is important to develop a simulation that models SARS-CoV-2 spread in indoor environments to evaluate mask usage effectiveness. Methods: A visual computer simulation was developed with Pygame in Python 3. A virtual indoor supermarket is simulated by a given flow of customers with an initial infection percentage and mask usage percentage who enter, move around, and exit a supermarket with shelves, tables and cashiers to demonstrate a systems dynamic complexity, i.e. nonlinear interactions of system elements over time. A supermarket was simulated with initial infection rates of 5%, 10%, and 20% and mask use percentages of 0%, 25%, 50% 75%, and 100%. The environmental settings (e.g. shelf number and location) and total customers (N=200) were kept constant. Results: The number of infected customers increased as the percentage of mask usage decreased (p < 0.01). At 5% initial infection, almost no infections were observed at 50% mask usage, with a logarithmic best-fit model (R2 = 0.947). At 10% initial infection, the association between mask usage and decrease in number of infections was best fit with a linear model (R2 = 0.924). For 20% initial infection, a quadratic model was the best fit (R2 = 0.934). While a linear model suggests proportional decreases in infection, the quadratic model suggests more significant reductions in infections at higher rates of mask use (i.e. increasing mask usage from 5% to 10% is less impactful than from 65% to 70%). Conclusion: The results suggest that mask usage has a significant impact on decreasing COVID-19 transmission. Ideally, mask usage should be as high as possible to achieve more significant reductions in COVID-19 infections. Various parameters can be adjusted during simulation as we learn more about SARS-CoV-2 to guide policies for minimizing COVID-19 transmission.","Lacson, R.; Veldkamp, P.; Zapanta, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.08.21258593v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.08.21258593,478

We compared the outcome of patients treated with TCZ and patients without TCZ considering a combined primary endpoint: death and/or ICU admissions. Results. Patients with TCZ (n=20) had a higher Charlson comorbidity index (5.3 [±2.4] vs 3.4 [±2.6], p=0.014), presented with more severe forms (higher level of oxygen therapy at 13 L/min vs 6 L/min, p<0.001), and had poorer biological findings (severe lymphopenia: 676/mm3 vs 914/mm3, p=0.037 and higher CRP level: 158 mg/l vs 105 mg/l, p=0.017) than patients without TCZ (n=25). However, death and/or ICU admissions were higher in patients without TCZ than in the TCZ group (72% vs 25%, p=0.002). Conclusion. Despite the small sample size and retrospective nature of the work, this result strongly suggests that TCZ may reduce the number of ICU admissions and/or mortality in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.","Klopfenstein, Timothée; Zayet, Souheil; Lohse, Anne; Balblanc, Jean-Charles; Badie, Julio; Royer, Pierre-Yves; Toko, Lynda; Mezher, Chaouki; Kadiane-Oussou, N’dri Juliette; Bossert, Marie; Bozgan, Ana-Maria; Charpentier, Aline; Roux, Marie-Françoise; Contreras, Remy; Mazurier, Isabelle; Dussert, Pascale; Gendrin, Vincent; Conrozier, Thierry",Med Mal Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X20301293?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medmal.2020.05.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32387320/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X20301293,478

Between 1994 and 2010, seven people became infected with HeV, four fatally. All infected people were at a higher risk of exposure from contact with horses as they were either veterinary personnel, assisting veterinarians, or working in the horse industry. The management of emerging zoonoses is best approached from a One Health perspective as it benefits biosecurity as well as a public health, including the health of those most at risk, in this case private veterinarians. In 2011 we conducted a cross-sectional study of private veterinarians registered in Queensland and providing veterinary services to horses. The aim of this study was to gauge if participants had adopted recommendations for improved infection control, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and the development of HeV specific management strategies during the winter of 2011. A majority of participants worked in practices that had a formal HeV management plan, mostly based on the perusal of official guidelines and an HeV field kit. The use of PPE increased as the health status of an equine patient decreased, demonstrating that many participants evaluated the risk of exposure to HeV appropriately; while others remained at risk of HeV infection by not using the appropriate PPE even when attending a sick horse. This study took place after Biosecurity Queensland had sent a comprehensive package about HeV management to all private veterinarians working in Queensland. However, those who had previous HeV experience through the management of suspected cases or had attended a HeV specific professional education programme in the previous 12 months were more likely to use PPE than those who had not. This may indicate that for private veterinarians in Queensland personal experience and face-to-face professional education sessions may be more effective in the improvement of HeV management than passive education via information packages. The role of different education pathways in the sustainable adoption of veterinary infection control measures should be further investigated.","Mendez, Diana; Buttner, Petra; Speare, Rick",Prev Vet Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25175674/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587714002542; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587714002542; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2014.08.002,478

We aim to assess the efficacy and safety of montelukast as add-on treatment in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: We propose a randomized, controlled, parallel, open-label trial involving 160 hospitalized adult patients with confirmed Covid-19. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either montelukast 10 mg, once a day for 14 days, in addition to standard of care (SoC), or SoC alone. SoC will follow the best practice for treating these patients, according to updated recommendations. The primary outcome is time to recovery. Participants will be assessed using diary cards to capture data on treatment-related improvements in an 8-point ordinal scale. Secondary endpoints will include changes in respiratory and inflammatory parameters, and adverse events. This phase IV clinical trial will take place at the University Hospital of São João, Porto. EudraCT number: 2020-001747-21. RESULTS: This study intends to generate scientific evidence on efficacy and safety of montelukast as add-on treatment in Covid-19. The results will be essential to improve clinical outcomes which remains to be determined. CONCLUSION: Montelukast has been suggested as a potential drug with 2 main actions on Covid-19. The validation of montelukast as an adjuvant treatment may improve lung injury, inflammation, and symptoms leading to a better prognosis. The use of this drug may fulfil the existing gap on therapeutic options.","Tavares, Margarida; Farraia, Mariana; Silva, Susana; Ribeiro, Ana Margarida; Severo, Milton; Paciência, Inês; Ribeiro, Raquel; Hespanhol, Venceslau; Guimarães, Tiago; Almeida, Jorge; Magro, Fernando; Sarmento, António; Oliveira, Ana Marta; Moreira, André",Porto Biomed J,https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pbj.0000000000000134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33869886/,478
631605,Novel and Evolving Therapies for COVID-19 Related Pulmonary Complications,2021-02-25,"Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have dramatically transformed industry, healthcare, mobility, and education. Many workers have been forced to shift to work-from-home, adjust their commute patterns, and/or adopt new behaviors. Particularly important in the context of mitigating transportation-related emissions is the shift to work-from-home. This paper focuses on two major shifts along different stages of the pandemic. First, it investigates switching to work-from-home during the pandemic, followed by assessing the likelihood of continuing to work-from-home as opposed to returning to the workplace. This second assessment, being conditioned on workers having experienced work-from-home as the result of the pandemic, allows important insights into the factors affecting work-from-home probabilities. Using a survey collected in July and August of 2020, it is found that nearly 50 percent of the respondents who did not work-from-home before but started to work-from-home during the COVID-19 pandemic, indicated the willingness to continue work-from-home. A total of 1,275 observations collected using the survey questionnaire, that was administered through a U.S. nationwide panel (Prime Panels), were used in the model estimation. The methodological approach used to study work-from-home probabilities in this paper captures the complexities of human behavior by considering the effects of unobserved heterogeneity in a multivariate context, which allows for new insights into the effect of explanatory variables on the likelihood of working from home. Random parameters logit model estimations (with heterogeneity in the means and variances of random parameters) revealed additional insights into factors affecting work-from-home probabilities. It was found that gender, age, income, the presence of children, education, residential location, or job sectors including marketing, information technologies, business, or administration/administrative support all played significant roles in explaining these behavioral shifts and post-pandemic preferences.","Barbour, Natalia; Menon, Nikhil; Mannering, Fred",Transp Res Interdiscip Perspect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34568809/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590198221001470; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2021.100441; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198221001470,478
631938,Basrah Preliminary Experience With COVID-19: A Report on 6404 Patients,2021-01-30,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2019. The coronavirus 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) controls replication and is therefore considered a major target for antiviral discovery. This study describes the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors in a novel self-assembled monolayer desorption ionization mass spectrometry (SAMDI-MS) enzymatic assay. Compared with a traditional FRET readout, the label-free SAMDI-MS assay offers greater sensitivity and eliminates false positive inhibition from compound interference with the optical signal. The SAMDI-MS assay was optimized and validated with known inhibitors of coronavirus 3CLpro such as GC376 (IC(50) = 0.060 μM), calpain inhibitors II and XII (IC(50) ~20–25 μM). The FDA-approved drugs shikonin, disulfiram, and ebselen did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity in the SAMDI-MS assay under physiologically relevant reducing conditions. The three drugs did not directly inhibit human β-coronavirus OC-43 or SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, but instead induced cell death. In conclusion, the SAMDI-MS 3CLpro assay, combined with antiviral and cytotoxic assessment, provides a robust platform to evaluate antiviral agents directed against SARS-CoV-2.","Gurard-Levin, Zachary A.; Liu, Cheng; Jekle, Andreas; Jaisinghani, Ruchika; Ren, Suping; Vandyck, Koen; Jochmans, Dirk; Leyssen, Pieter; Neyts, Johan; Blatt, Lawrence M.; Beigelman, Leonid; Symons, Julian A.; Raboisson, Pierre; Scholle, Michael D.; Deval, Jerome",Antiviral Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104924; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220303387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32896566/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354220303387,478
632141,Developing a risk assessment score for cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-09-30,"Flavaglines are formed by cycloaddition of a flavonoid nucleus with a cinnamic acid moiety representing a typical chemical character of the genus Aglaia of the family Meliaceae. Based on biosynthetic considerations 148 derivatives are grouped together into three skeletal types representing 77 cyclopenta[b]benzofurans, 61 cyclopenta[bc]benzopyrans, and 10 benzo[b]oxepines. Apart from different hydroxy, methoxy, and methylenedioxy groups of the aromatic rings, important structural variation is created by different substitutions and stereochemistries of the central cyclopentane ring. Putrescine-derived bisamides constitute important building blocks occurring as cyclic 2-aminopyrrolidines or in an open-chained form, and are involved in the formation of pyrimidinone flavaglines. Regarding the central role of cinnamic acid in the formation of the basic skeleton, rocagloic acid represents a biosynthetic precursor from which aglafoline- and rocaglamide-type cyclopentabenzofurans can be derived, while those of the rocaglaol-type are the result of decarboxylation. Broad-based comparison revealed characteristic substitution trends which contribute as chemical markers to natural delimitation and grouping of taxonomically problematic Aglaia species. A wide variety of biological activities ranges from insecticidal, antifungal, antiprotozoal, and anti-inflammatory properties, especially to pronounced anticancer and antiviral activities. The high insecticidal activity of flavaglines is comparable with that of the well-known natural insecticide azadirachtin. Comparative feeding experiments informed about structure–activity relationships and exhibited different substitutions of the cyclopentane ring essential for insecticidal activity. Parallel studies on the antiproliferative activity of flavaglines in various tumor cell lines revealed similar structural prerequisites that let expect corresponding molecular mechanisms. An important structural modification with very high cytotoxic potency was found in the benzofuran silvestrol characterized by an unusual dioxanyloxy subunit. It possessed comparable cytotoxicity to that of the natural anticancer compounds paclitaxel (Taxol®) and camptothecin without effecting normal cells. The primary effect was the inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the translation initiation factor eIF4A, an ATP-dependent DEAD-box RNA helicase. Flavaglines were also shown to bind to prohibitins (PHB) responsible for regulation of important signaling pathways, and to inhibit the transcriptional factor HSF1 deeply involved in metabolic programming, survival, and proliferation of cancer cells. Flavaglines were shown to be not only promising anticancer agents but gained now also high expectations as agents against emerging RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2. Targeting the helicase eIF4A with flavaglines was recently described as pan-viral strategy for minimizing the impact of future RNA virus pandemics.","Greger, Harald",Phytochem Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104125/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11101-021-09761-5,478
632323,High-Dose Intravenous Immunoglobulin in Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Multicenter Retrospective Study in China,2021-02-19,"Parasites and pathogens are a fundamental driving force in the ecology and evolution of mammalian populations, and understanding disease processes in natural populations is an urgent priority in the face of increased rates of infectious disease emergence. In this review, we argue that mammalogists are uniquely placed to contribute to addressing these challenges because in-depth knowledge of mammal species is fundamental to the development of wild model systems that could accelerate discovery in disease ecology. The use of animal models—species for which a broad range of diagnostic, molecular, and genetic tools have been developed—in tightly controlled laboratory environments has been instrumental in driving progress in the biomedical sciences. However, in natural populations, disease processes operate in the context of enormous genetic, phenotypic, and environmental variability. Understanding diseases in animal populations (including humans) thus requires investment in “wild animal models” that explicitly include individual variation and relevant environmental gradients. Wild mammal groups such as primates and rodents have already been identified as potentially useful models of infectious diseases in the wild. Here, we discuss the enormous potential that ungulates hold as candidates for wild model systems. The diversity, broad geographic distribution, and often high abundance of species in this group make them a highly accessible target for disease research. Moreover, a depth of background knowledge, close relationships to domesticated animals, and ongoing management of many wild ungulate species provide context, tools, and opportunity for cutting-edge research at the interface of ecological and biomedical sciences. Studies of wild ungulates are already helping to unravel some key challenges in infectious disease research, including the role of parasites in trophic cascades, the consequences of climate change for disease dynamics, and the systems biology of host–parasite interactions. Other areas where ungulate studies may provide new insight include research on the sources and drivers of emerging infectious diseases.","Jolles, Anna E.; Ezenwa, Vanessa O.",J Mammal,https://doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyu007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287382/,478
632343,Evidenced-based best practice advice for patients treated with systemic immunosuppressants in relation to COVID-19()()(),2020-05-14,"A newly emerged coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, caused severe outbreaks of pneumonia in China in December 2019 and has since spread to various countries around the world. To probe the origin and transmission dynamics of this virus, we performed phylodynamic analysis of 247 high quality genomic sequences of viruses available in the GISAID platform as of March 05, 2020. A substantial number of earliest sequences reported in Wuhan in December 2019, including those of viruses recovered from the Huanan Seafood Market (HNSM), the site of the initial outbreak, were genetically diverse, suggesting that viruses of multiple sources were involved in the original outbreak. The viruses were subsequently disseminated to different parts of China and other countries, with diverse mutational profiles being recorded in strains recovered subsequently. Interestingly, four genetic clusters defined as Super-transmitters (STs) were found to become dominant and were responsible for the major outbreaks in various countries. Among the four clusters, ST1 is widely disseminated in Asia and the US and mainly responsible for outbreaks in the states of Washington and California in the US as well as those in South Korea at the end of February and early March, whereas ST4 contributed to the pandemic in Europe. Each ST cluster carried a signature mutation profile which allowed us to trace the origin and transmission patterns of specific viruses in different parts of the world. Using the signature mutations as markers of STs, we further analysed 1539 genome sequences reported after February 29, 2020. We found that around 90% of these genomes belonged to STs with ST4 being the dominant one and their contribution to pandemic in different continents were also depicted. The identification of these super-transmitters provides insight into the control of further transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","YANG, Xuemei; Dong, Ning; CHAN, Wai-Chi; CHEN, Sheng",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20071399v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.20071399,478

The outbreak of COVID-19, has not only caused widespread morbidity and mortality, but has also led to a catastrophic breakdown in the global economy and unprecedented social disruption. To lessen the global health consequences of COVID-19, sweeping COVID-19 lockdown and quarantine measures have been imposed within many nations. These measures have significantly impacted the world's economy and in many cases has led to the loss of livelihood. Mathematical modeling of pandemics is of critical importance to understand the unfolding of transmission events and to formulate control measures. In this research letter, we have introduced a novel approach to forecasting epidemics like COVID-19. The proposed mathematical model stems from the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics, and can be utilized to make projections of the number of infected people. This unique mathematical model can be beneficial for predicting and designing potential strategies to mitigate the spread and impact of pandemics.","Rabbani, H.; Osei-Bonsu, K.; Osei-Bonsu, P.

AIM: To explore the experiences of adolescents with eczema and psoriasis with healthcare professionals, and to distil the participants’ key messages for their healthcare providers. DESIGN: This is a secondary thematic analysis of interviews with adolescents with eczema or psoriasis. PARTICIPANTS: There were a total of 41 text transcripts of interviews with young people with eczema or psoriasis who had given permission for secondary analysis; 23 of the participants had eczema, and 18 psoriasis. Participants were living in the UK at time of interview, and aged 15–24 years old. RESULTS: We have distilled the following key messages from young people with eczema and psoriasis for healthcare providers: (1) address the emotional impact; (2) give more information, with the subtheme and (3) appreciate patient research. We identified the following eczema-specific themes: (ECZ-4) ‘It’s not taken seriously’; (ECZ-5) offer choice in treatment and (ECZ-6) lack of structure/conflicting advice. Two psoriasis-specific themes were identified: (PSO-4) feeling dehumanised/treat me as a person; and (PSO-5) think about how treatments will affect daily life. CONCLUSION: This qualitative data analysis highlights the need for greater recognition of the emotional impact of skin disease in adolescence, and for more comprehensive provision of information about the conditions. We call for greater sensitivity and flexibility in our approach to adolescents with skin disease, with important implications for healthcare delivery to this group.","de Vere Hunt, Isabella Joy; McNiven, Abigail; Roberts, Amanda; Parmar, Himesh; McPherson, Tess",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33514575/,478

It has prompted researchers to rapidly mobilize their efforts towards identifying and developing anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines. Discovering and understanding the virus’ pathways of infection, host-protein interactions, and cytopathic effects will greatly aid in the design of new therapeutics to treat COVID-19. While it is known that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, extensively explored as clinical agents for COVID-19, have multiple cellular effects including inhibiting autophagy, there are also dose-limiting toxicities in patients that make clearly establishing their potential mechanisms-of-action problematic. Therefore, we evaluated a range of other autophagy modulators to identify an alternative autophagy-based drug repurposing opportunity. In this work, we found that 6 of these compounds blocked the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells with EC(50) values ranging from 2.0 to 13 μM and selectivity indices ranging from 1.5 to >10-fold. Immunofluorescence staining for LC3B and LysoTracker dye staining assays in several cell lines indicated their potency and efficacy for inhibiting autophagy correlated with the measurements in the SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay.

She experienced a marked worsening of her respiratory status despite the limited size of the infiltrations seen on chest computed tomography. She responded to treatment with dexamethasone and remdesivir, and did not require mechanical ventilation. She recovered her pre-COVID-19 respiratory function. This case illustrates that patients with severe lung parenchymal destruction due to advanced LAM are at risk of worsening hypoxemia, but may not have a bad outcome if managed appropriately.

634903,"Hepatic pathology in patients dying of COVID-19: a series of 40 cases including clinical, histologic, and virologic data",2020-08-13,"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, some K-12 schools resumed in-person classes with varying degrees of mitigation plans in the fall 2020. Physical distancing and face coverings can minimize SARS-CoV-2 spread, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, no research has focused on adherence to mitigation strategies during school days. Thus, we sought to develop a systematic observation protocol to capture COVID-19 mitigation strategy adherence in school environments: The Systematic Observation of COVID-19 Mitigation (SOCOM). METHODS: We extended previously validated and internationally used tools to develop the SOCOM training and implementation protocols to assess physical-distancing and face-covering behaviors. SOCOM was tested in diverse indoor and outdoor settings (classrooms, lunchrooms, physical education [PE], and recess) among diverse schools (elementary, secondary, and special needs). RESULTS: For the unique metrics of physical-distancing and face-covering behaviors, areas with less activity and a maximum of 10–15 students were more favorable for accurately capturing data. Overall proportion of agreement was high for physical distancing (90.9%), face covering (88.6%), activity type (89.2%), and physical activity level (87.9%). Agreement was lowest during active recess, PE, and observation areas with ≥20 students. CONCLUSIONS: Millions of children throughout the USA are likely to return to school in the months ahead. SOCOM is a relatively inexpensive research tool that can be implemented by schools to determine mitigation strategy adherence and to assess protocols that allow students return to school safely and slow the spread of COVID-19.","Camplain, Ricky; Lopez, Nanette V.; Cooper, Dan M.; McKenzie, Thomas L.; Zheng, Kai; Radom-Aizik, Shlomit",Journal of clinical and translational science,https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2021.786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258031/,478

Total joint replacement (TJR) candidates returning to elective surgeries (median age 68 years) may exhibit similar lymphocyte and/or antibody protection to COVID-19 prior to vaccination METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed antibody titters, lymphocyte memory, and inflammatory biomarkers specific for the Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a cohort of n=73 returning TJR candidates (knees and/or hips) pre-operatively. RESULTS: Peripheral blood serum of TJR candidate patients exhibited a positivity rate of 18.4% and 4% for IgG antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins, respectively. 13.5% of TJR candidates exhibited positive lymphocyte reactivity (SI > 2) to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and 38% to the spike protein.

The change in the hydrogen ion concentration in the lungs and pH dependence of the activity of carbonic anhydrase, a key respiration enzyme, are critical factors. An acute bifurcation transition determining either the life or collapse of the system is demonstrated. The transition is associated with exponential increase in the concentrations of participants in the process and with functioning of the key enzyme, carbonic anhydrase.

The SARS Extranet was a single, managed electronic and limited access system to manage local, provincial and other SARS control information. METHODS: During July, 2003, a web-based and paper-based survey was conducted with 53 SARS Steering Committee members in Hamilton. It assessed the use and perceptions of the Extranet that had been built to support the committee during the SARS outbreak. Before distribution, the survey was user-tested based on a think-aloud protocol, and revisions were made. Quantitative and qualitative questions were asked related to frequency of use of the Extranet, perceived overall usefulness of the resource, rationale for use, potential barriers, strengths and limitations, and potential future uses of the Extranet. RESULTS: The response rate was 69.4% (n = 34). Of all respondents, 30 (88.2%) reported that they had visited the site, and rated it highly overall (mean = 4.0; 1 = low to 5 = high). However, the site was rated 3.4 compared with other communications strategies used during the outbreak. Almost half of all respondents (44.1%) visited the site at least once every few days. The two most common reasons the 30 respondents visited the Extranet were to access SARS Steering Committee minutes (63.3%) and to access Hamilton medical advisories (53.3%). The most commonly cited potential future uses for the Extranet were the sending of private emails to public health experts (63.3%), and surveillance (63.3%). No one encountered personal barriers in his or her use of the site, but several mentioned that time and duplication of email information were challenges. CONCLUSION: Despite higher rankings of various communication strategies during the SARS outbreak, such as email, meetings, teleconferences, and other web sites, users generally perceived a local Extranet as a useful support for the dissemination of local information during public health emergencies.","Valaitis, Ruta K; Akhtar-Danesh, Noori; Kealey, Cathy M; Brunetti, Glenn M; Thomas, Helen",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15967040/,478

636483,Practical issues faced by cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in India,2020-09-30,"INTRODUCTION: Guatemala reported the first confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case on March 13(th) 2020. Up to now, more than 140,000 confirmed cases have been documented, with 8% of them being <20 years-old. The impact of COVID-19 in pediatric cancer in not well known, even though pediatric oncological institutions did some initial recommendations, this new disease still represents a challenge in this population. The objective of the report is to describe the moderate-severe cases of COVID-19 in pediatric cancer during the first 8 months of the pandemic in the Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica (UNOP). METHODS: This is a descriptive, prospective report of pediatric cancer patients <20 years-old and SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab with PCR technique at UNOP from May to December 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 test was performed to all patients who developed symptoms of infection or as screening in patients who were admitted to UNOP regardless of symptoms. Information about sex, age, primary oncological diagnosis, confirmed coinfections and treatment received at time of COVID-19 was collected. Moderate illness was considered if the patient required supplemental oxygen and severe illness if admitted to Intensive Care Unit -ICU- secondary to COVID-19. RESULTS: Two hundred one patients with pediatric cancer with the SARS-CoV-2 infection were confirmed. Sixty four percent were male (n=128), median of age was 9.5 years (5-m to 18-y). The primary oncologic diagnosis was leukemia 65% (n=129), and other solid tumors 35% (n=72), 5% (n=10) of patients were in palliative care. In leukemia patients, 40% were receiving induction therapy (n=51), 25% consolidation (n=32), and 19% maintenance (n=25). The most common initial symptom was fever in 32% (n=64) and 33% were asymptomatic (n=67). Twenty two percent developed moderate disease (n=44) and 13% severe disease (n=26). A total of 13 patients died during COVID-19 period (6%) and 7 of them died receiving active treatment (3%). The risk of developing moderate-severe disease was not higher in leukemia patients compared to patients with other tumors who were receiving intense chemotherapy (OR=0.7), but there might be a higher risk of death (OR=1.41). In patients with leukemia, the risk of developing moderate-severe disease was higher for patients receiving induction therapy compared with those in consolidation (OR=6.7) or maintenance (OR=3.04). Mortality risk seems to be higher in patients with leukemia during induction therapy (OR=1.94). Confirmed coinfections correlated with higher risk of severe illness (OR=1.95) and death during the COVID-19 period (OR=5.2). CONCLUSIONS: The mortality due to COVID-19 in pediatric cancer is low and could be related to coinfections or intensive chemotherapy. Important limitation of our report is the lack of analysis of underlying clinical conditions in moderate-severe disease (neutropenia or other comorbidities), factors that could have an impact on our data analysis.","Escobar, Susana María Godoy; Herrera, Thelma Beatriz Velásquez; Rosado, Roy Enrique; Cojulun, Alicia Chang; Toledo, Mario Augusto Melgar; Klussmann, Federico Antillón",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piab031.045,478

However, the existence and prevalence of shared VH3-53-encoded antibodies in the antibody repertoires is not clear. Using antibody repertoire sequencing, we found that the usage of VH3-53 increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection. A highly shared VH3-53-J6 clonotype was identified in 9 out of 13 COVID-19 patients. This clonotype was derived from convergent gene rearrangements with few somatic hypermutations and was evolutionary conserved. We synthesized 34 repertoire-deduced novel VH3-53-J6 heavy chains and paired with a common IGKV1-9 light chain to produce recombinant mAbs. Most of these recombinant mAbs (23/34) possess RBD binding and virus-neutralizing activities, and recognize ACE2 binding site via the same molecular interface. Our computational analysis, validated by laboratory experiments, revealed that VH3-53 antibodies targeting RBD are commonly present in COVID-19 patients’ antibody repertoires, indicating many people have germline-like precursor sequences to rapidly generate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, antigen-specific mAbs can be digitally obtained through antibody repertoire sequencing and computational analysis.","Yan, Qihong; He, Ping; Huang, Xiaohan; Luo, Kun; Zhang, Yudi; Yi, Haisu; Wang, Qian; Li, Feng; Hou, Ruitian; Fan, Xiaodi; Li, Pingchao; Liu, Xinglong; Liang, Huan; Deng, Yijun; Chen, Zhaoming; Chen, Yunfei; Mo, Xiaoneng; Feng, Liqiang; Xiong, Xiaoli; Li, Song; Han, Jian; Qu, Linbing; Niu, Xuefeng; Chen, Ling",Emerging microbes & infections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33944697/; https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2021.1925594,478

As the spread of the virus is probably getting out of control on every day, the epidemic is now crossing the most dreadful phase. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a risk factor for COVID-19 as patients with long-term lung injuries are more likely to suffer in the severity of the infection. Transcriptomic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 infection and IPF patients in lung epithelium cell datasets were selected to identify the synergistic effect of SARS-CoV-2 to IPF patients. Common genes were identified to find shared pathways and drug targets for IPF patients with COVID-19 infections. Using several enterprising Bioinformatics tools, protein–protein interactions (PPIs) network was designed. Hub genes and essential modules were detected based on the PPIs network. TF-genes and miRNA interaction with common differentially expressed genes and the activity of TFs are also identified. Functional analysis was performed using gene ontology terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway and found some shared associations that may cause the increased mortality of IPF patients for the SARS-CoV-2 infections.

The disease is attributed to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which enters host cells through binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface. Clinical syndromes such as hypertension that display reduced ACE2 expression tend to correlate with a more severe disease course, whereas treatments which upregulate ACE2 such as the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) appear to have a protective effect against COVID-19. Pre-clinical studies have shown that plasma soluble ACE2 could render SARS-CoV-2 inactive in a dose-dependent manner. The association of clinical syndromes or treatments that impact ACE2 expression and clinical severity of COVID-19 infection combined with the reduction in viral load with human recombinant serum ACE2 shown in pre-clinical studies indicate a key role for ACE2 in determining COVID-19 severity. In conclusion, we propose that measurement of ACE2 level may help identify individuals at risk of severe infection where targeted shielding can be used and could provide a novel therapeutic target.","Gue, Ying Xuan; Kanji, Rahim; Markides, Vias; Gorog, Diana Adrienne",Am J Cardiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002914920305580?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002914920305580; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2020.06.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32636018/,478

Multiple vaccines are in development, but no efficacious vaccine is currently available. METHODS We designed a multi-center phase 1/2a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study to assesses the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S, a non-replicating adenovirus 26 based vector expressing the stabilized pre-fusion spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Ad26.COV2.S was administered at a dose level of 5x1010 or 1x1011 viral particles (vp) per vaccination, either as a single dose or as a two-dose schedule spaced by 56 days in healthy adults (18-55 years old; cohort 1a & 1b; n= 402 and healthy elderly >65 years old; cohort 3; n=394). Vaccine elicited S specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA and neutralizing titers were measured in a wild-type virus neutralization assay (wtVNA). CD4+ T-helper (Th)1 and Th2, and CD8+ immune responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). RESULTS We here report interim analyses after the first dose of blinded safety data from cohorts 1a, 1b and 3 and group unblinded immunogenicity data from cohort 1a and 3. In cohorts 1 and 3 solicited local adverse events were observed in 58% and 27% of participants, respectively. Solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 64% and 36% of participants, respectively. Fevers occurred in both cohorts 1 and 3 in 19% (5% grade 3) and 4% (0% grade 3), respectively, were mostly mild or moderate, and resolved within 1 to 2 days after vaccination. The most frequent local adverse event (AE) was injection site pain and the most frequent solicited AEs were fatigue, headache and myalgia. After only a single dose, seroconversion rate in wtVNA (50% inhibitory concentration - IC50) at day 29 after immunization in cohort 1a already reached 92% with GMTs of 214 (95% CI: 177; 259) and 92% with GMTs of 243 (95% CI: 200; 295) for the 5x1010 and 1x1011vp dose levels, respectively. A similar immunogenicity profile was observed in the first 15 participants in cohort 3, where 100% seroconversion (6/6) (GMTs of 196 [95%CI: 69; 560]) and 83% seroconversion (5/6) (GMTs of 127 [95% CI: <58; 327]) were observed for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively. Seroconversion for S antibodies as measured by ELISA (ELISA Units/mL) was observed in 99% of cohort 1a participants (GMTs of 528 [95% CI: 442; 630) and 695 (95% CI: 596; 810]), for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively, and in 100% (6/6 for both dose levels) of cohort 3 with GMTs of 507 (95% CI: 181; 1418) and 248 (95% CI: 122; 506), respectively. On day 14 post immunization, Th1 cytokine producing S-specific CD4+ T cell responses were measured in 80% and 83% of a subset of participants in cohort 1a and 3, respectively, with no or very low Th2 responses, indicative of a Th1-skewed phenotype in both cohorts. CD8+ T cell responses were also robust in both cohort 1a and 3, for both dose levels. CONCLUSIONS The safety profile and immunogenicity after only a single dose are supportive for further clinical development of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp, as a potentially protective vaccine against COVID-19.

639262,A Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) of COVID-19 Outcomes by Race Using the Electronic Health Records Data in Michigan Medicine,2021-03-25,"BACKGROUND: The emergence and re-emergence of vector-borne and other infectious diseases of poverty pose a threat to the health of populations living in urban and low-income settings. A detailed understanding of intervention strategies, including effectiveness of past outbreak containment, is necessary to improve future practices. The objective was to determine what is known about the effectiveness of containment measures for emerging and re-emerging vector-borne and other infectious diseases of poverty in urban settings and identify research gaps and implications for public health practice. MAIN BODY: We conducted a scoping review and systematically searched peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 2000 and 2016. Different data extraction tools were used for data coding and extraction, and data on implementation process and transferability were extracted from all studies. A quality assessment was conducted for each included study. We screened 205 full-text articles and reports for a total of 31 articles included in the review. The quality of the studies was generally low to moderate. The largest body of evidence concerned control activities for Ebola virus and dengue fever. The majority of interventions (87%) relied on multiple types of measures, which were grouped into four categories: 1) healthcare provision; 2) epidemiological investigation and/or surveillance; 3) environmental or sanitary interventions; and 4) community-based interventions. The quality of the majority of studies (90%) was poor or moderate, and one-third of the studies did not provide a clear description of the outcomes and of the procedures and/or tools used for the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the difficulty of establishing causation when assessing the effect of containment measures. Studies that extend beyond solely reporting on effectiveness and take into account the complexity of real-world settings are urgently needed. We recommend the allocation of research efforts to the evaluation of the implementation processes of interventions as well as their comprehensive and systematic description using validated checklists.

639274,Validation of a composed COVID-19 chest radiography score: the CARE project,2020-10-26,"Background. As of August 5, 2020, there were more than 4.8M confirmed and probable cases and 159K deaths attributable to SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, with these numbers undoubtedly reflecting a significant underestimate of the true toll. Geographic, racial-ethnic, age and socioeconomic disparities in exposure and mortality are key features of the first and second wave of the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic. Methods. We used individual-level COVID-19 incidence and mortality data from the U.S. state of Michigan to estimate age-specific incidence and mortality rates by race/ethnic group. Data were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian regression models, and model results were validated using posterior predictive checks. Findings. In crude and age-standardized analyses we found rates of incidence and mortality more than twice as high than Whites for all groups other than Native Americans. Of these, Blacks experienced the greatest burden of confirmed and probable COVID-19 infection (Age- standardized incidence = 1,644/100,000 population) and mortality (age-standardized mortality rate 251/100,000). These rates reflect large disparities, as Blacks experienced age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 5.6 (95% CI = 5.5, 5.7) and 6.9 (6.5, 7.3) times higher than Whites, respectively. We also found that the bulk of the disparity in mortality between Blacks and Whites is driven by dramatically higher rates of COVID-19 infection across all age groups, particularly among older adults, rather than age-specific variation in case-fatality rates. Interpretation. This work suggests that well-documented racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality in hard-hit settings, such as the U.S. state of Michigan, are driven primarily by variation in household, community and workplace exposure rather than case-fatality rates.

Four experiments were conducted to: 1) determine if medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) are effective mitigants when applied to feed both pre- and post-porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) inoculation measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), 2) evaluate varying levels and combinations of MCFA measured by qRT-PCR, and 3) evaluate selected treatments in bioassay to determine infectivity. In exp. 1, treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 + 1 factorial with main effects of treatment (0.3% commercial formaldehyde [CF] product, Sal CURB [Kemin Industries, Inc.; Des Moines, IA], or 1% MCFA blend (Blend) of 1:1:1 C6:C8:C10 [PMI, Arden Hills, MN]) and timing of application (pre- or post-inoculation with PEDV) plus a positive control (PC; feed inoculated with PEDV and no treatment). All combinations of treatment and timing decreased detectable PEDV compared with the PC (P < 0.05). Pre-inoculation treatment elicited decreased magnitude of PEDV detection (cycle threshold value) compared with post-inoculation (P = 0.009). Magnitude of PEDV detection was decreased for CF compared with Blend (P < 0.0001). In exp. 2, pre-inoculation treatments consisted of: 1) PC, 2) 0.3% CF, 3 to 5) 0.125% to 0.33% C6:0, 6 to 8) 0.125% to 0.33% C8:0, 9 to 11) 0.125% to 0.33% C10:0, and 12 to 15) 0.125% to 0.66% C5:0. Treating feed with 0.33% C8:0 resulted in decreased (P < 0.05) PEDV detection compared with all other treatments. Increasing concentration of each individual MCFA decreased PEDV detectability (P < 0.042). In exp. 3, pre-inoculation treatments consisted of: 1) PC, 2) 0.3% CF, 3 to 7) 0.25% to 1% Blend, 8 to 10) 0.125% to 0.33% C6:0 + C8:0, 11 to 13) 0.125% to 0.33% C6:0 + C10:0, and 14 to 16) 0.125% to 0.33% C8:0 + C10:0. Treating feed with CF, 0.5% Blend, 0.75% Blend, 1% Blend, all levels of C6:0+C8:0, 0.25% C6:0 + 0.25% C10:0, 0.33% C6:0 + 0.33% C10:0, 0.25% C8:0 + 0.25% C10:0, or 0.33% C8:0 + 0.33% C10:0 elicited decreased detection of PEDV compared with PC (P < 0.05). Increasing concentration of each MCFA combination decreased PEDV detectability (linear, P < 0.012). In exp. 4, feed was treated pre-inoculation with: 1) no treatment (PC), 2) 0.3% CF, 3) 0.5% Blend, or 4) 0.3% C8:0 and analyzed via qRT-PCR and bioassay. Adding 0.5% Blend or 0.3% C8:0 resulted in decreased PEDV compared with PC and only PC resulted in a positive bioassay. Therefore, MCFA can decrease detection of PEDV in feed. Further, inclusion of lower levels of MCFA than previously evaluated are effective against PEDV.","Lerner, Annie B; Cochrane, Roger A; Gebhardt, Jordan T; Dritz, Steve S; Jones, Cassandra K; DeRouchey, Joel M; Tokach, Mike D; Goodband, Robert D; Bai, Jianfa; Porter, Elizabeth; Anderson, Joe; Gauger, Phillip C; Magstadt, Drew R; Zhang, Jianqiang; Bass, Benjamin; Karnezos, Theodore; de Rodas, Brenda; Woodworth, Jason C",J Anim Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32447386/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skaa159,478
639345,Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in COVID-19-related encephalopathy,2020-10-08,"A central quantity of interest in molecular biology and medicine is the free energy of binding of a molecule to a target biomacromolecule. Until recently, the accurate prediction of binding affinity had been widely regarded as out of reach of theoretical methods owing to the lack of reproducibility of the available methods, not to mention their complexity, computational cost and time-consuming procedures. The lack of reproducibility stems primarily from the chaotic nature of classical molecular dynamics (MD) and the associated extreme sensitivity of trajectories to their initial conditions. Here, we review computational approaches for both relative and absolute binding free energy calculations, and illustrate their application to a diverse set of ligands bound to a range of proteins with immediate relevance in a number of medical domains. We focus on ensemble-based methods which are essential in order to compute statistically robust results, including two we have recently developed, namely thermodynamic integration with enhanced sampling and enhanced sampling of MD with an approximation of continuum solvent. Together, these form a set of rapid, accurate, precise and reproducible free energy methods. They can be used in real-world problems such as hit-to-lead and lead optimization stages in drug discovery, and in personalized medicine. These applications show that individual binding affinities equipped with uncertainty quantification may be computed in a few hours on a massive scale given access to suitable high-end computing resources and workflow automation. A high level of accuracy can be achieved using these approaches.","Wan, Shunzhou; Bhati, Agastya P.; Zasada, Stefan J.; Coveney, Peter V.",Interface Focus,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsfs.2020.0007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33178418/,478

The aim of this study was to investigate the duration of CD in patients with sudden subjective olfactory and/or gustatory loss during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The secondary aim was to identify possible prognostic factors for the duration of CD. METHODS: An online baseline questionnaire was designed to assess subjective CD. Three rounds of follow-up questionnaires were sent out to any participants with persistent CD in 6-week intervals, prospectively assessing subjective chemosensory function and extending the follow-up time of this cohort significantly. RESULTS: In total, 467 participants completed the baseline questionnaire. The most significant improvement and recovery of chemosensory function was observed within the first month after the initial loss. Rates became stagnant after about 2 months, and only little improvement and recovery was seen after 2–4 months. After a mean follow-up of 95.9 days (olfactory dysfunction) and 94.0 days (gustatory dysfunction), 86.7% of participants reported gustatory improvement and 82.6% reported olfactory improvement, while 55.0% reported full gustatory recovery and 43.8% reported full olfactory recovery. Female gender was associated with better improvement of gustatory function. High subjective severity of chemosensory loss was associated with lower rates of olfactory and gustatory recovery as well as improvement of olfactory function. Young age was not associated with a better prognosis. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Rates of improvement and recovery of chemosensory function decreased after 2–4 months after initial chemosensory loss, possibly indicating that prolonged and perhaps permanent chemosensory loss may be a complication of SARS-CoV-2 infections. High subjective severity of CD may worsen the prognosis for improvement and recovery of chemosensory function.","Schwab, Janne; Jensen, Caroline Damsgaard; Fjaeldstad, Alexander Wieck",ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec,https://doi.org/10.1159/000515132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33789309/,478
640051,The emotional impact of COVID-19 outbreak on cancer out-patients and their caregivers: Impressions from the heart of the Italian pandemic,2020-09-30,"There is a possible role for oxidative stress, a state characterized by an altered balance between the production of free radicals or reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defences, in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the genesis of which is quite complex. Excessive oxidative stress could be responsible for the alveolar damage, thrombosis, and red blood cell dysregulation observed in COVID-19. Apparently, deficiency of glutathione (GSH), a low-molecular-weight thiol that is the most important non-enzymatic antioxidant molecule and has the potential to keep the cytokine storm in check, is a plausible explanation for the severe manifestations and death in COVID-19 patients. Thiol drugs, which are considered mucolytic, also possess potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. They exhibit antibacterial activity against a variety of medically important bacteria and may be an effective strategy against influenza virus infection. The importance of oxidative stress during COVID-19 and the various pharmacological characteristics of thiol-based drugs suggest a possible role of thiols in the treatment of COVID-19. Oral and intravenous GSH, as well as GSH precursors such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC), or drugs containing the thiol moiety (erdosteine) may represent a novel therapeutic approach to block NF-kB and address the cytokine storm syndrome and respiratory distress observed in COVID-19 pneumonia patients","Cazzola, Mario; Rogliani, Paola; Salvi, Sundeep Santosh; Ora, Josuel; Matera, Maria Gabriella",Lung,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00408-021-00465-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34448938/,478

AIMS: In this study, we investigate the incidence of postponed, medically necessary, time-sensitive urological procedures due to a patient’s unwillingness to proceed to a recommended surgical intervention during the first phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: We prospectively monitored all patients undergoing elective urological surgery during the initial phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The primary outcome measurement was incidence of postponed, medically necessary, urological procedures due to the patient’s decision not to proceed to a recommended urological intervention (16th of March–5th of June 2020). The secondary outcome measurements were the type of delayed procedure and duration of postponement. RESULTS: During the initial 12-week period of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 155 elective urgent urological procedures were scheduled after pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 screening. In total, 140 procedures were performed and 15 (10%) patients intentionally delayed their urological procedure due to the perceived risk of acquiring nosocomial perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection. The duration for procedural delays is currently 42 ± 23 (range: 15–80) days. The most frequently postponed procedures among patients unwilling to proceed to surgery are urgent endourological procedures due to symptomatic urolithiasis (n = 7/15). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence for patients postponing urological procedures due to the risk of acquiring nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 is 10%. Endourological procedures for urolithiasis are the most frequently postponed procedures by patients. This study demonstrates that a subset of patients will decline urgent urological surgery during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","McDermott, Aoibhinn; O’Kelly, John; Quinlan, Mark Jack; Little, Dilly M.; Davis, Niall Francis",Ir J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33201439/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-020-02438-6,478

Yet, quality, effective healthcare delivery, and access to information about best practice remains a challenge to nurses and midwives in the WHO Afro-region. For nurses and midwives to have the capacity to practice safely and competently they need to engage in mandatory Continuing Professional Development (CPD). However a composite picture is not available for future project planners, researchers, and policy developers. Published literature from the past five years and professional body webpages were searched. The results of shining a light on the WHO Afro-region member states CPD status revealed strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The strengths lay in the beginnings of mandatory CPD and annual licensure renewal, while the weaknesses revealed inequity of CPD distribution across the region. The opportunities showed international academic partnership with possibilities for further engagement, and the threats were evident in the health context of the Afro-region, the shortage of nurses and the lesser participation of nurses in CPD programs.

Recently, some patients with COVID-19 have been shown to have neurological symptoms such as headache, anosmia, dysgeusia, dizziness, impaired consciousness, and ischemic stroke. CASE PRESENTATION: we describe a case of ischemic stroke as the main presentation of COVID-19 in a 68 years old man with no previous history, without any associated respiratory signs; clinical examination revealed left hemiparesis with dysarthria and left facial paralysis, NIHSS score was at 11, the brain CT scan performed 1h30min later, completed by a brain MRI that came back in favor of right frontal, temporal and parietal ischemic stroke. The decision of thrombolysis was indicated in urgency, and the patient benefited from thrombolysis, which proceeded without incidents; the outcome was favorable with regression of symptoms. Ischemic stroke has been widely described among the thromboembolic complications of COVID-19, but only a few papers have reported it as a primary manifestation of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: SARS-COV 2 infection can spread from the respiratory system to the central nervous system, resulting in an inflammatory response and excessive secretion of inflammatory markers, leading to ischemic stroke.","Rajae, Alkouh; Manal, Merbouh; Ghizlane, El Aidouni; Amine, Bouabdlaoui; I.Zaid; Houssam, Bkiyar; Yassine, Mabrouk; Brahim, Housni",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080121008621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34631044/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102912; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080121008621?v=s5,478

The aim of this study was to describe time use in the execution of vaccine trials, to identify steps that could be accelerated to improve preparedness and planning for future emerging infectious diseases vaccine trials. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods approach to map time use and process steps that could be accelerated during vaccine trials. Trials for vaccines against infectious diseases registered in three global trial databases reported in the period 2011-2017 were eligible to join the survey. We invited sponsors to contribute data through a predefined structured questionnaire for clinical trial process metrics. Data were stratified by trial phase, disease type (i.e. emerging infectious diseases or not emerging infectious diseases), sponsor type, and continent. Qualitative interviews were conducted with purposively selected sponsors, and thematic analysis of the interview transcripts was performed. RESULTS: Based on data from 155 vaccine trials including 29,071 subjects, 52% were phase I, 23% phase II, and 25% phase III. We found that the regulatory approval, subject enrollment, study execution, and study close-out accounted for most of the cycle time of the vaccine trial process. Cycle times for the regulatory and ethical approvals, contract agreement, site initiation, and study execution were shorter in trials conducted during outbreaks. Qualitative interviews indicated that early engagement of the regulatory and independent ethical committee authorities in planning the vaccine trials was critical for saving time in trial approval. Furthermore, adapting the trial implementation to the reality of the study sites and active involvement of the local investigators during the planning of the trial and protocol writing were stated to be of paramount importance to successful completion of trials at an accelerated pace. CONCLUSION: The regulatory approval, subject recruitment, study execution, and close-out cycle times accounted for most of the vaccine trial time use and are activities that could be accelerated during a vaccine trial planning and implementation. We encourage tracking of key cycle time metrics and facilitating sharing of knowledge across industry and academia, as this may serve to reduce the time from index case detection to access of a vaccine during emerging infectious diseases epidemics.","Mandi, Henshaw; Yimer, Solomon Abebe; Norheim, Gunnstein",Clin Trials,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33653146/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1740774520977283,478

Remote health monitoring through telemedicine can help people discover potential health threats in time. In the COVID-19 pandemic, remote health monitoring can help obtain and analyze biomedical signals including human body temperature without direct body contact. This technique is of great significance to achieve safe and efficient health monitoring in the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing remote biomedical signal monitoring methods cannot effectively analyze the time series data. This paper designs a remote biomedical signal monitoring framework combining the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G communication and artificial intelligence techniques. In the constructed framework, IoT devices are used to collect biomedical signals at the perception layer. Subsequently, the biomedical signals are transmitted through the 5G network to the cloud server where the GRU-AE deep learning model is deployed. It is noteworthy that the proposed GRU-AE model can analyze multi-dimensional biomedical signals in time series. Finally, this paper conducts a 24-week monitoring experiment for 2000 subjects of different ages to obtain real data. Compared with the traditional biomedical signal monitoring method based on the AutoEncoder model, the GRU-AE model has better performance.

However, a comprehensive understanding of how social media has altered the foci and methods in public health research remains lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine research themes, the role of social media, and research methods in social media–based public health research published from 2000 to 2018. METHODS: A dataset of 3419 valid studies was developed by searching a list of relevant keywords in the Web of Science and PubMed databases. In addition, this study employs an unsupervised text-mining technique and topic modeling to extract research themes of the published studies. Moreover, the role of social media and research methods adopted in those studies were analyzed. RESULTS: This study identifies 25 research themes, covering different diseases, various population groups, physical and mental health, and other significant issues. Social media assumes two major roles in public health research: produce substantial research interest for public health research and furnish a research context for public health research. Social media provides substantial research interest for public health research when used for health intervention, human-computer interaction, as a platform of social influence, and for disease surveillance, risk assessment, or prevention. Social media acts as a research context for public health research when it is mere reference, used as a platform to recruit participants, and as a platform for data collection. While both qualitative and quantitative methods are frequently used in this emerging area, cutting edge computational methods play a marginal role.

The collinearity of the mRNA and the protein sequence is essential for the quality of the cellular proteome. Spontaneous errors in decoding or translocation are rare and result in a deficient protein. However, dedicated recoding signals in the mRNA can reprogram the ribosome to read the message in alternative ways. This review summarizes the recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of three types of recoding events: stop-codon readthrough, –1 ribosome frameshifting and translational bypassing. Recoding events provide insights into alternative modes of ribosome dynamics that are potentially applicable to other non-canonical modes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation.","Rodnina, Marina V; Korniy, Natalia; Klimova, Mariia; Karki, Prajwal; Peng, Bee-Zen; Senyushkina, Tamara; Belardinelli, Riccardo; Maracci, Cristina; Wohlgemuth, Ingo; Samatova, Ekaterina; Peske, Frank",Nucleic Acids Res,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511883/,478

The etiological backgrounds of these infections remain unconfirmed in most clinical cases. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of human coronavirus infections in a series of children hospitalized with symptoms of acute respiratory tract disease in a one-year period in Slovenia. METHODS: The 664 specimens from 592 children under six years of age hospitalized at the University Children’s Hospital in Ljubljana were sent for the routine laboratory detection of respiratory viruses. Respiratory viruses were detected with a direct immunofluorescence assay and human coronaviruses were detected with a modified real-time RT–PCR. RESULTS: HCoV RNA was detected in 40 (6%, 95% CI: 4.3%–8.1%) of 664 samples.

Infection with HCoV occurred as a coinfection with one or more other viruses in most samples (70%). Of the HCoV-positive children, 70.3% had lower respiratory tract infections. CONCLUSION: The results of our study show that HCoV are frequently detected human pathogens, often associated with other respiratory viruses and acute respiratory tract infections in hospitalized children. An association between age and the viral load was found. The highest viral load was detected in children approximately 10 months of age.","Jevšnik, Monika; Uršič, Tina; Žigon, Nina; Lusa, Lara; Krivec, Uroš; Petrovec, Miroslav",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-12-365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23256846/,478

PURPOSE: This study analyzed and compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of COVID-19 and influenza A and B infections in children. METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated the medical data of 206 pediatric COVID-19 and 411 pediatric seasonal influenza A or B patients. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients were older than seasonal influenza patients (median [interquartile range], 7.75 [2–14] years vs. 4 [2–6] years). The frequency of fever and cough in COVID-19 patients was lower than that of seasonal influenza patients (80.6% vs. 94.4%, P<0.001 and 22.8 % vs. 71.5%, P<0.001, respectively). Ageusia (4.9%) and anosmia (3.4%) were present in only COVID-19 patients. Leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were encountered more frequently in influenza patients than in COVID-19 patients (22.1% vs. 8.5%, P=0.029; 17.6% vs. 5.6%, P=0.013; and 13.2% vs. 5.6%, P= 0.048, respectively). Both groups showed significantly elevated monocyte levels in the complete blood count (70.4% vs. 69.9%, P=0.511). Major chest x-ray findings in COVID-19 patients included mild diffuse ground-glass opacity and right lower lobe infiltrates. There were no statistically significant intergroup differences in hospitalization or mortality rates; however, the intensive care unit admission rate was higher among COVID-19 patients (2.4% vs. 0.5%, P=0.045). CONCLUSION: In this study, pediatric COVID-19 patients showed a wide range of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic/mild to severe illness. We found no intergroup differences in hospitalization rates, oxygen requirements, or hospital length of stay; however, the intensive care unit admission rate was higher among COVID-19 patients.","Siddiqui, Meraj; Gültekingil, Ayşe; Bakırcı, Oğuz; Uslu, Nihal; Baskın, Esra",Clin Exp Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.3345/cep.2021.00066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34015895/,478

Due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Tokyo Metropolitan government has been forced to expand their acute health-care capacity corresponding to infectious diseases within a short period. Responding to this situation, health emergency and disaster experts of the Tokyo Disaster Medical Assistance Team took the initiative in creating a brief education course. We established the course for expanding infectious disease care capacity by a dedicated hands-on lecture for health professionals who are unfamiliar with infectious disease care in ordinary circumstances. Our lecture included the typical course of COVID-19, use of personal protective equipment, environmental sterilization, medical-ward zoning, and safe caregiving. Hospitals that received customized lectures reported by means of a questionnaire that the lectures were well suited to their needs. Currently, the health-care system in Tokyo has increased its capacity to meet the demand and has not been affected by COVID-19. Our experience shows that health emergency and disaster experts can assist hospitals in crisis by providing educational materials.","Kato, Soichiro; Miyakuni, Yasuhiko; Inoue, Yoshitaka; Yamaguchi, Yoshihiro",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32713410/; https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.264,478

In this observational population-based cohort study, we examined longitudinal changes in psychological distress associated with testing positive for COVID-19. METHODS: Participants (N = 8,002; Observations = 139,035) were drawn from 23 waves of the Understanding America Study, a nationally representative survey of American adults followed-up every two weeks from April 1 2020 to February 15 2021. Psychological distress was assessed using the standardized total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). RESULTS: Over the course of the study 576 participants reported testing positive for COVID-19. Using regression analysis including individual and time fixed effects we found that psychological distress increased by 0.29 standard deviations (p <.001) during the two-week period when participants first tested positive for COVID-19. Distress levels remained significantly elevated (d = 0.16, p <.01) for a further two weeks, before returning to baseline levels. Coronavirus symptom severity explained changes in distress attributable to COVID-19, whereby distress was more pronounced among those whose symptoms were more severe and were slower to subside. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that testing positive for COVID-19 is associated with an initial increase in psychological distress that diminishes quickly as symptoms subside. While COVID-19 may not produce lasting psychological distress among the majority of the general population it remains possible that a minority may suffer longer-term mental health consequences.","Daly, Michael; Robinson, Eric",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791721/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.25.21254326; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.25.21254326v1?rss=1,478
644179,Mortality monitoring in Switzerland,2021,"Background/Purpose A synthesis design and multistate analysis is required for assessing the clinical efficacy of antiviral therapy on dynamics of multistate disease progression and in reducing the mortality and enhancing the recovery of patients with COVID-19. A case study on remdesivir was illustrated for the clinical application of such a novel design and analysis. Methods A Bayesian synthesis design was applied to integrating the empirical evidence on the one-arm compassion study and the two-arm ACTT-1 trial for COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir. A multistate model was developed to model the dynamics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients from three transient states of low, medium-, and high-risk until the two outcomes of recovery and death. The outcome measures for clinical efficacy comprised high-risk state, death, and discharge. Results The efficacy of remdesivir in reducing the risk of death and enhancing the odds of recovery were estimated as 31% (95% CI, 18-44%) and 10% (95% CI, 1-18%), respectively. Remdesivir therapy for patients with low-risk state showed the efficacy in reducing subsequent progression to high-risk state and death by 26% (relative rate (RR), 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55-0.93) and 62% (RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29-0.48), respectively. Less but still statistically significant efficacy in mortality reduction was noted for the medium- and high-risk patients. Remdesivir treated patients had a significantly shorter period of hospitalization (9.9 days) compared with standard care group (12.9 days). Conclusions The clinical efficacy of remdesvir therapy in reducing mortality and accelerating discharge has been proved by the Bayesian synthesis design and multistate analysis.","Liao, Sih-Han; Hung, Chien-Ching; Chen, Chiung-Nien; Yen, Jui-Yi; Hsu, Chen-Yang; Yen, Amy Ming-Fang; Chen, Chi-Ling",J Formos Med Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2021.04.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34074579/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664621001832?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929664621001832,478

Since then it has spread in more than 210 countries and territories. It is a viral disease due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The patients show flu-like symptoms with a dry cough, sore throat, high fever, and breathing problems. The disease due to SARS-CoV-2 was named as COVID-19. About 2.2 million people have been infected with more than 0.15 million deaths globally. The United States of America is the most affected country with the highest patients of about 0.7 million. Despite great efforts, there is no treatment of this disease. However, prevention and management are the best options. This article describes SARS-CoV-2, disease, prevention and management, treatment and social impact on society. It was analyzed that a combination of antiviral drugs with hydroxyl-chloroquine and azithromycin (with the consultation of a medical practitioner) may be the best option to treat the patients, depending on the patient's conditions and symptoms. However, Unani therapy may be useful along with allopathic treatment. It is urgently advised and requested that all the persons should follow the preventive measures, managements and quarantine strictly without any religious discrepancy otherwise the situation may be the worst. Also, there is an urgent requirement to educate our new generation for science and technology to fight against any such disaster in future; if any.

644928,Arthralgia as an initial presentation of COVID-19: observation,2020-03-28,"In this study, we proposed a model combing parallel imaging (PI) with generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture (PIC-GAN) for accelerated multi-channel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. This model integrated data fidelity and regularization terms into the generator to benefit from multi-coils information and provide an “end-to-end” reconstruction. Besides, to better preserve image details during reconstruction, we combined the adversarial loss with pixel-wise loss in both image and frequency domains. The proposed PIC-GAN framework was evaluated on abdominal and knee MRI images using 2, 4 and 6-fold accelerations with different undersampling patterns. The performance of the PIC-GAN was compared to the sparsity-based parallel imaging (L1-ESPIRiT), the variational network (VN), and conventional GAN with single-channel images as input (zero-filled (ZF)-GAN). Experimental results show that our PIC-GAN can effectively reconstruct multi-channel MR images at a low noise level and improved structure similarity of the reconstructed images. PIC-GAN has yielded the lowest Normalized Mean Square Error (in [Formula: see text]) (PIC-GAN: 0.58 ± 0.37, ZF-GAN: 1.93 ± 1.41, VN: 1.87 ± 1.28, L1-ESPIRiT: 2.49 ± 1.04 for abdominal MRI data and PIC-GAN: 0.80 ± 0.26, ZF-GAN: 0.93 ± 0.29, VN:1.18 ± 0.31, L1-ESPIRiT: 1.28 ± 0.24 for knee MRI data) and the highest Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PIC-GAN: 34.43 ± 1.92, ZF-GAN: 31.45 ± 4.0, VN: 29.26 ± 2.98, L1-ESPIRiT: 25.40 ± 1.88 for abdominal MRI data and PIC-GAN: 34.10 ± 1.09, ZF-GAN: 31.47 ± 1.05, VN: 30.01 ± 1.01, L1-ESPIRiT: 28.01 ± 0.98 for knee MRI data) compared to ZF-GAN, VN and L1-ESPIRiT with an under-sampling factor of 6.

We provide a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 epidemiology across the state of Texas, which includes vast rural & vulnerable communities that may be disproportionately impacted by the spread of this new disease. All 254 Texas counties were included in this study. We examined the geographic variation of COVID-19 from March 1 through April 8, 2020 by extracting data on incidence and case fatality from various national and state datasets. We contrasted incidence and case fatality rates by county-level demographic and healthcare resource factors. Counties which are part of metropolitan regions, such as Harris and Dallas, experienced the highest total number of confirmed cases. However, the highest incidence rates per 100,000 population were in found in counties of Donley (353.5), Castro (136.4), Matagorda (114.4) and Galveston (93.4). Among counties with greater than 10 cases, the highest CFR were observed in counties of Comal (10.3%), Hockley (10%), Hood (10%), and Castro (9.1%). Counties with the highest CFR (> 10%) had a higher proportion of non-Hispanic Black residents, adults aged 65 and older, and adults smoking, but lower number of ICU beds per 100,000 population, and number of primary care physicians per 1000 population.

This questionnaire survey was conducted amongst adult heart failure (HF) patients in the United Kingdom (UK), to understand the impact of COVID-19 upon HF services. Methods and Results The survey was conducted by the Pumping Marvellous Foundation (PMF), a UK HF patient charity. Survey Monkey was used to disseminate the questionnaire in the PMF online patient group and in 10 UK hospitals (out-patient hospital and community HF clinics). 1050 responses were collected (693/1050-66% women); 55% (579/1050) were aged over 60 years. Anxiety level was significantly higher regarding COVID19 (mean 7+/-2.5 on anxiety scale of 0 to 10) compared to anxiety regarding HF (6.1+/-2.4; p<0.001). Anxiety was higher amongst patients aged =60 years about HF (6.3+/-2.2 versus 5.9+/-2.5 in those aged >60 years; p=0.005) and COVID-19 (7.3+/-2.3 versus 6.7+/-2.6 those aged >60 years; p<0.001). 65% respondents (686/1050) reported disruption to HF appointments (cancellation or postponement) during the lockdown period. 37% reported disruption to medication prescription services and 34% reported inability to access their HF teams promptly. 32% expressed reluctance to attend hospital (25% stated they would only attend hospital if there was no alternative and 7% stated that they would not attend hospital at all). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant anxiety amongst HF patients regarding COVID-19 and HF.

The effectiveness of such controls depends largely on public knowledge, attitude, and practices towards this novel virus. The prime objective of this study is to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of university students and graduates in Pakistan regarding COVID-19. For this purpose, cross-sectional data is collected from 1789 participants through an online survey conducted between July 12 and August 10. The survey instrument consists of demographic characteristics, 13 items on knowledge, 6 items on attitudes, and 3 items on practices, modified from a previously published questionnaire on COVID-19. Our statistical analyses are based on descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The overall correct response rate of the knowledge section is 73%, which is comparatively lower than similar studies in the region. The majority of participants are optimistic about the successful control of COVID-19 in Pakistan, and following the instructions issued by the government of Pakistan. However, a bulk of participants showed skepticism and no trust in the health facilities of hospitals in Pakistan, which could be the potential explanation of falling confirmed cases in Pakistan. In addition, a low knowledge score is found to be significantly associated with low confidence in successful control of COVID-19, and socially undesirable practices. The results suggest an urgent need for health education programs to hold optimistic attitudes and rebuilding of trust of the general public in health facilities in local hospitals to avoid the possible next wave of COVID-19 in Pakistan.","Arslan Iqbal, Muhammad; Zeeshan Younas, Muhammad",Child Youth Serv Rev,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105784; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740920322064?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33311825/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0190740920322064,478

METHODS: We predefined colchicine, eplerenone and ticagrelor as candidates for repurposing towards novel therapy for T2MI or myocardial injury. Considering eligibility for randomisation in a clinical trial, each drug was classified according to indications and contraindications for therapy and survival for at least 24 hours following admission. Eligibility criteria for prescription were evaluated against the Summary of Medical Product Characteristics. Consecutive hospital admissions were screened to identify patients with ≥1 high-sensitivity troponin-I value >99th percentile.

RESULTS: The virus was detected in 25 specimens including ten abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue samples (62%), six testes (67%), and nine thyroid (36%) samples. The analysis of multiple endocrine organ samples obtained from the same patients showed that, in virus-positive cases, the viral genome was consistently detected in all but two matched specimens. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that the virus spread into endocrine organs is a common event in severe cases. Further studies should assess the rate of the phenomenon in clinically mild cases.

646199,Does TB Vaccination Reduce COVID-19 Infection?: No Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Analysis,2020-04-22,"We propose and study an epidemiological model on a social network that takes into account heterogeneity of the population and different vaccination strategies. In particular, we study how the COVID-19 epidemics evolves and how it is contained by different vaccination scenarios by taking into account data showing that older people, as well as individuals with comorbidities and poor metabolic health, and people coming from economically depressed areas with lower quality of life in general, are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms, and quicker loss of immunity and are therefore more prone to reinfection. Our results reveal that the structure and the spatial arrangement of subpopulations are important epidemiological determinants. In a healthier society the disease spreads more rapidly but the consequences are less disastrous as in a society with more prevalent chronic comorbidities. If individuals with poor health are segregated within one community, the epidemic outcome is less favorable. Moreover, we show that, contrary to currently widely adopted vaccination policies, prioritizing elderly and other higher-risk groups is beneficial only if the supply of vaccine is high. If, however, the vaccination availability is limited, and if the demographic distribution across the social network is homogeneous, better epidemic outcomes are achieved if healthy people are vaccinated first. Only when higher-risk groups are segregated, like in elderly homes, their prioritization will lead to lower COVID-19 related deaths. Accordingly, young and healthy individuals should view vaccine uptake as not only protecting them, but perhaps even more so protecting the more vulnerable socio-demographic groups.","Markovič, Rene; Šterk, Marko; Marhl, Marko; Perc, Matjaž; Gosak, Marko",Results Phys,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211379721005507; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2021.104433; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211379721005507?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34123716/,478

We estimate the infection fatality rate, the case fatality rate, and the basic reproduction number, modeled as a time-varying function, by calibrating on the cumulative daily number of observed deaths and notified infected, after fixing to plausible values the other model parameters to assure identifiability. The confidence intervals are estimated by a parametric bootstrap procedure and a Global Sensitivity Analysis is performed to assess the sensitivity of the estimates to changes in the values of the fixed parameters. According to our results, the basic reproduction number drops from an initial value of 6.055 to 0 at the end of the national lockdown, then it grows again, but remaining under 1. At the beginning of the epidemic, the case and the infection fatality rates are estimated to be 13.1% and 2.3%, respectively. Among the parameters considered as fixed, the average time from infection to recovery for the not notified infected appears to be the most impacting one on the model estimates. The probability for an infected to be notified has a relevant impact on the infection fatality rate and on the shape of the epidemic curve.

We undertook a service evaluation involving all current in-patients within a single, English medium secure hospital to describe the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine among this population. Data regarding capacity to consent to the vaccine, acceptance/refusal of this (and reasons for refusal) and demographics was retrospectively collected from the patients’ clinical records and analysed. In total, 85 patients (92.4% of eligible patients) had capacity to decide if they wanted the COVID-19 vaccine. Of these 68 (80.0%) consented and 17 (20.0%) declined to consent. A similar proportion of patients aged under and over 40 years old consented to have the vaccine. Those from a Black Asian minority ethnic background were more likely to decline the vaccine than White British patients. The reasons for capacitous refusal appeared similar to those seen in the general population.","Gibbon, Simon; McPhail, Emma; Mills, Georgina; McBride, Martin; Storer, Rebekah; Taylor, Nicholas; McCarthy, Lucy",BJPsych Open,https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34059167/,478
647477,The Role of Fever Clinics in the Strategic Triage of Suspected Cases of Imported COVID-19,2021-05-25,"BACKGROUND: South Africa implemented rapid and strict physical distancing regulations to minimize SARS-CoV-2 epidemic spread. Evidence on the impact of such measures on interpersonal contact in rural and lower-income settings is limited. METHODS: We compared population-representative social contact surveys conducted in the same rural KwaZulu-Natal location once in 2019 and twice in mid-2020. Respondents reported characteristics of physical and conversational (‘close interaction’) contacts over 24 hours. We built age-mixing matrices and estimated the proportional change in the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number (R(0)). Respondents also reported counts of others present at locations visited and transport used, from which we evaluated change in potential exposure to airborne infection due to shared indoor space (‘shared air’). RESULTS: Respondents in March-December 2019 (n=1704) reported a mean of 7.4 close interaction contacts and 196 shared air person-hours beyond their homes. Respondents in June-July 2020 (n=216), as the epidemic peaked locally, reported 4.1 close interaction contacts and 21 shared air person-hours outside their home, with significant declines in others’ homes and public spaces. Adults aged over 50 had fewer close contacts with others over 50, but little change in contact with 15–29 year olds, reflecting ongoing contact within multigenerational households. We estimate potential R(0) fell by 42% (95% plausible range 14–59%) between 2019 and June-July 2020. DISCUSSION: Extra-household social contact fell substantially following imposition of Covid-19 distancing regulations in rural South Africa. Ongoing contact within intergenerational households highlighted the limitation of social distancing measures in protecting older adults.

Options for the prevention or therapy of HCV infection are limited; there is no vaccine and the nonspecific, interferon-based treatments now in use are frequently ineffective and have significant side effects. A small-animal model for HCV infection would significantly expedite antiviral compound development and preclinical testing, as well as open new avenues to decipher the mechanisms that underlie viral pathogenesis. The natural species tropism of HCV is, however, limited to humans and chimpanzees. Here, we discuss the prospects of developing a mouse model for HCV infection, taking into consideration recent results on HCV entry and replication, and new prospects in xenotransplantation biology. We highlight three independent, but possibly complementary, approaches towards overcoming current species barriers and generating a small-animal model for HCV pathogenesis.","Ploss, Alexander; Rice, Charles M.",EMBO reports,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2775186?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19834510/; https://doi.org/10.1038/embor.2009.223,478

We used next generation sequencing (NGS) to investigate the possible infectious causes of gastroenteritis in puppies from a dog kennel in Victoria, Australia. The near complete genome of a canine astrovirus was obtained from pooled faecal samples, and was found to be 94.7% identical with a canine astrovirus detected in the United Kingdom in 2012. The phylogenetic analysis of the capsid gene found similarities to those of canine astroviruses identified in Italy in 2005 and in UK and Hungary in 2012, but distant from that of a canine astrovirus previously identified in Australia in 2012. Thus, different serotypes of canine astrovirus are likely circulating in Australia. The close relationship to European astroviruses also suggested that there had been recent movements of ancestor canine astroviruses between Australia and Europe. NGS also detected other infections in the puppies including several canine papillomaviruses and a canine parvovirus (vaccine strain) as well as a very low level of campylobacter. Canine astrovirus was the probable cause of diarrhoea in these puppies, with the possible involvement of campylobacter bacteria. NGS was effective as a non-targeted method to determine the likely infectious cause of gastroenteritis.","Bhatta, Tarka Raj; Chamings, Anthony; Vibin, Jessy; Alexandersen, Soren",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30872719/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41045-z,478

Analysis of these new species is important for research into animal models of hepatitis C virus infection and into the zoonotic origins of human viruses. Here, we provide the first systematic phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of these two genera at the whole-genome level. Phylogenies confirmed that hepatitis C virus is most closely related to viruses from horses whereas human pegiviruses clustered with viruses from African primates. Within each genus, several well-supported lineages were identified and viral diversity was structured by both host species and location of sampling. Recombination analyses provided evidence of interspecific recombination in hepaciviruses, but none in the pegiviruses. Putative mosaic genome structures were identified in NS5B gene region and were supported by multiple tests. The identification of interspecific recombination in the hepaciviruses represents an important evolutionary event that could be clarified by future sampling of novel viruses. We also identified parallel amino acid changes shared by distantly related lineages that infect similar types of host. Notable parallel changes were clustered in the NS3 and NS4B genes and provide a useful starting point for experimental studies of the evolution of Hepacivirus host–virus interactions.","Thézé, Julien; Lowes, Sophia; Parker, Joe; Pybus, Oliver G.",Genome Biol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26494702/; https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evv202,478

Few studies have evaluated rapid antigen tests in real-world settings or among large populations. Beginning October 2020, Florida offered individuals presenting for SARS-CoV-2 testing PCR testing if they tested positive by the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 antigen (Ag) card, were symptomatic, or required or requested PCR testing. We compared results among individuals who received both types of tests at four publicly accessible testing sites across Florida. We calculated the positive percent agreement (PPA) between the two test types by symptom status. Subsequently, we evaluated the PPA among individuals regardless of symptoms with lower cycle threshold values (<30). Overall, 18,457 individuals were tested via both methods, of which 3,153 (17.1%) were positive by PCR. The PPA for the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card using the PCR comparator was 49.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.4% to 50.9%). Among symptomatic individuals the PPA was 51.9% (95% CI, 49.7% to 54.0%). When restricted to positive PCR tests with a cycle threshold value of <30, regardless of symptom status, the PPA was 75.3% (95% CI, 72.8% to 77.6%).

649527,Disturbing effect of lockdown for COVID-19 on the incidence of infective endocarditis: a word of caution,2020-06-10,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory infections are the main causes for hospitalization in children and a common reason for the initiation of antibiotic treatment. Rapid antigen detection tests and point-of-care mPCR-based assays provide a fast detection of viral pathogens. Nonetheless, the prescription rate of antibiotics for respiratory infections is exceedingly high. In particular, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infections frequently cause antibiotic treatment. METHODS: Children hospitalized in our clinic with an acute respiratory infection between January 2008 and January 2013 were included in the present study. Data of 3799 children were analyzed retrospectively for clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and antibiotic and inhalation treatment. We performed an in-house m-RT-PCR-ELISA method for pathogen detection. RESULTS: Pathogen detection was possible in 2464 patients. In 6.3%, hMPV and, in 24.0%, RSV were detected. Patients positively tested for hMPV received inhalation therapy in 62.9%; patients positive for RSV in 73.8%. Patients positive for hMPV were treated with antibiotics in 62.3%. Patients with RSV infection received antibiotic treatment in 44.4%; all others in 43.5%. Notably, a positive result in RSV-RADT was associated with reduced number of antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSION: hMPV infections inherit a two times higher probability of antibiotic treatment. There was no significant difference in laboratory findings or body temperature between hMPV infection and infections caused by other pathogens. Clinical symptoms seem not to differ from those in RSV illness. Nonetheless, RSV infections triggered significantly lower antibiotic prescription rates. A considerate application of a POC-mPCR for patients with RSV-like symptoms and age of 1 year and older with a negative RSV-RADT might lead to higher detection rates of hMPV and a reduction in prescription of antibiotics.","Schreiner, D.; Groendahl, B.; Puppe, W.; Off, H.

Investigation of mental health in a region with one of the longest lockdowns and lowest COVID-19 prevalence globally (Victoria, Australia) allowed for evaluation of mental health in the absence of direct pandemic mental health consequences. Surveys were administered during 15-24 September 2020 to Victorian residents aged ≥18 years for The COVID-19 Outbreak Public Evaluation (COPE) Initiative. Responses were compared cross-sectionally with April-2020 data, and longitudinally among respondents who completed both surveys. Multivariable Poisson regressions were used to estimate prevalence ratios for adverse mental health symptoms, substance use, and suicidal ideation adjusted for demographics, sleep, and behaviours (e.g., screen-time, outdoor-time). In September-2020, among 1157 Victorians, one-third reported anxiety or depressive disorder symptoms, one-fifth reported suicidal ideation, and one-tenth reported having seriously considered suicide within 30 days. Young adults, unpaid caregivers, those with disabilities, and those with pre-existing psychiatric or sleep conditions showed increased prevalence of adverse mental health symptoms. Prevalence of symptoms of burnout, anxiety, and depressive disorder were unchanged between April-2020 and September-2020.

While PCR remains the frontline test of choice in the acute diagnostic setting, serological tests are urgently needed. Unlike PCR tests which are highly specific, cross-reactivity is a major challenge for COVID-19 antibody tests considering there are six other coronaviruses known to infect humans. SARS-CoV is genetically related to SARS-CoV-2 sharing approximately 80% sequence identity and both belong to the species SARS related coronavirus in the genus Betacoronavirus of family Coronaviridae. We developed and compared the performance of four different serological tests to comprehensively assess the cross-reactivity between COVID-19 and SARS patient sera. There is significant cross-reactivity when N protein of either virus is used. The S1 or RBD regions from the spike (S) protein offers better specificity. Amongst the different platforms, capture ELISA performed best. We found that SARS survivors all have significant levels of antibodies remaining in their blood 17 years after infection. Anti-N antibodies waned more than anti-RBD antibodies, and the latter is known to play a more important role in providing protective immunity.","Chia, Wan Ni; Tan, Chee Wah; Foo, Randy; Kang, Adrian Eng Zheng; Peng, Yilong; Sivalingam, Velraj; Tiu, Charles; Ong, Xin Mei; Zhu, Feng; Young, Barnaby E.; Chen, Mark I.-C.; Tan, Yee-Joo; Lye, David C.; Anderson, Danielle E.; Wang, Lin-Fa",Emerging microbes & infections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32529906/; https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1780951,478
650476,A Patient With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia and Sudden Decompensation While Receiving Mechanical Ventilatory Support,2021-04-06,"Recently, the controversial hypothesis that BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) vaccination reduces infection or severity of COVID-19 has been proposed. The present study examined this hypothesis using statistical approaches based on the public data. Three approaches were utilized: 1) comparing the infection and mortality ratio of people on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, 2) comparing the number of mortalities among nations, and 3) comparing the maximum daily increase rate of total mortalities among nations. The result of 1) showed that there is no significant difference in infection per person onboard and mortality-infection between Japanese citizens vs. other nationalities and BCG obligatory nations vs. non-BCG obligatory nations on the Diamond Princess. The result of 2) showed that the number of mortalities among nations is similar to the previous studies, but this analysis also considered the timing of COVID-19 arrival in each nation. After correcting for arrival time, previously reported effect of BCG vaccination on decreasing total mortality disappeared. This is because nations that lack BCG vaccination are concentrated in Western Europe, which is near an epicenter of COVID-19. Therefore some previous reports are now considered to be affected by this artifact; the result may have been flawed by on-land dispersal from an epicenter. However, some results showed weakly significant differences in the number of deaths at a particular time among BCG obligatory and non-BCG nations (especially the use of Japanese BCG strain Tokyo 172). However, these results are affected by the results of three countries and the effect of BCG vaccination remains inconclusive. The result of 3) showed that the maximum daily increasing rate in death among nations showed no significant difference among BCG vaccination policies. In the present study, although some results showed statistically significant differences among BCG vaccination policies, they may be affected by the impact of various other factors, such as national infection-control policies, social distancing, behavioral changes of people, possible previous local epidemics of closely related viruses, or inter-population differences in ACE2 or other genetic polymorphism. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying cause of the observed differences in infection and mortality of the disease among nations. Nevertheless, our results show that the effect of BCG vaccination, if any, can be masked by many other factors. Therefore, the possible effect might be relatively small. In fact, in Japan, where almost all citizens have been vaccinated, COVID-19 cases are constantly increasing. Given the importance of peoples behavior in preventing viral propagation, the spread of optimism triggered by this hypothesis would be harmful to BCG vaccination nations.","Asahara, Masakazu",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.20068601; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20068601v1?rss=1,478

The Covid-19 pandemic has led to the novel situation that hospitals must prioritize staff for a vaccine rollout while there is acute shortage of the vaccine. In spite of the availability of guidelines from state agencies, there is partial confusion about what an optimal rollout plan is. This study investigates effects in a hospital model under different rollout schemes. Methods. A simulation model is implemented in VBA, and is studied for parameter variation in a predefined hospital setting. The implemented code is available as open access supplement. Main results. A rollout scheme assigning vaccine doses to staff primarily by staff’s pathogen exposure maximizes the predicted open hospital capacity when compared to a rollout based on a purely hierarchical prioritization. The effect increases under resource scarcity and greater disease activity. Nursing staff benefits most from an exposure focused rollout. Conclusions. The model employs SARS-CoV-2 parameters; nonetheless, effects observable in the model are transferable to other infectious diseases.

652063,"The COVID‐19 era and pediatric procedural sedation: A consecutive case series with an emphasis on preparation, precautions, and risk reduction",2020-10-26,"Virus infection of host cells is sensed by innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and induces production of type I interferons (IFNs) and other inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines orchestrate the elimination of the viruses but are occasionally detrimental to the hosts. The outcomes and pathogenesis of viral infection are largely determined by the specific interaction between the viruses and their host cells. Therefore, compounds that either inhibit viral infection or modulate virus-induced cytokine response should be considered as candidates for managing virus infection. The aim of the study was to identify compounds in both categories, using a single cell-based assay. Our screening platform is a HEK293 cell-based reporter assay where the expression of a firefly luciferase is under the control of a human IFN-β promoter. We have demonstrated that infection of the reporter cell line with a panel of RNA viruses activated the reporter gene expression that correlates quantitatively with the levels of virus replication and progeny virus production, and could be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by known antiviral compound or inhibitors of PRR signal transduction pathways. Using Dengue virus as an example, a pilot screening of a small molecule library consisting of 26,900 compounds proved the concept that the IFN-β promoter reporter assay can serve as a convenient high throughput screening platform for simultaneous discovery of antiviral and innate immune response modulating compounds. A representative antiviral compound from the pilot screening, 1-(6-ethoxybenzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3-(3-methoxyphenyl) urea, was demonstrated to specifically inhibit several viruses belonging to the family of flaviviridae.","Guo, Fang; Zhao, Xuesen; Gill, Tina; Zhou, Yan; Campagna, Matthew; Wang, Lijuan; Liu, Fei; Zhang, Pinghu; DiPaolo, Laura; Du, Yanming; Xu, Xiaodong; Jiang, Dong; Wei, Lai; Cuconati, Andrea; Block, Timothy M; Guo, Ju-Tao; Chang, Jinhong",Antiviral Research,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354214001168; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.04.010; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4143146?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354214001168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792753/,478
652875,Commentary: Recovery following COVID-19 infection: Are we truly ready for what is to come?,2020-12-29,"Serologic studies are crucial for clarifying dynamics of the coronavirus disease pandemic. Past work on serologic studies (e.g., during influenza pandemics) has made relevant contributions, but specific conditions of the current situation require adaptation. Although detection of antibodies to measure exposure, immunity, or both seems straightforward conceptually, numerous challenges exist in terms of sample collection, what the presence of antibodies actually means, and appropriate analysis and interpretation to account for test accuracy and sampling biases. Successful deployment of serologic studies depends on type and performance of serologic tests, population studied, use of adequate study designs, and appropriate analysis and interpretation of data. We highlight key questions that serologic studies can help answer at different times, review strengths and limitations of different assay types and study designs, and discuss methods for rapid sharing and analysis of serologic data to determine global transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","Clapham, Hannah; Hay, James; Routledge, Isobel; Takahashi, Saki; Choisy, Marc; Cummings, Derek; Grenfell, Bryan; Metcalf, C.

Due to the extensiveness of spread and death, it has been declared as a pandemic. This review focused on the current pandemic situation and understanding the prevention and control strategies of COVID-19. Data presented here was by April 3, 2020. A total of 1,016,399 cases of COVID-19 with 53,238 deaths was reported from 204 countries and territories including two international conveyances over the world. After China, most of the new cases were from Europe, particularly Italy acting as the source of importation to many of the other countries around the world. China has obtained success by ascribing control strategies against COVID-19. The implementation of China’s strategy, as well as the development of a vaccine, may control the pandemic of COVID-19. Further robust studies are required for a clear understanding of transmission parameters, prevention, and control strategies of SARS-CoV-2.

653673,Properties of a scale of concern for COVID-19: Exploratory analysis in a Peruvian sample(),2020-11-22,"We describe the cytokine profiles of a large cohort of hospitalized patients with moderate to critical COVID-19, focusing on IL-6, sIL2R, and IL-10 levels before and after receiving immune modulating therapies, namely, tocilizumab and glucocorticoids. We also discuss the possible roles of sIL2R and IL-10 as markers of ongoing immune dysregulation after IL-6 inhibition. We performed a retrospective chart review of adult patients admitted to a tertiary care center with moderate to critical SARS-CoV-2 infection. Disease severity was based on maximum oxygen requirement during hospital stay to maintain SpO2 > 93% (moderate, 0–3 L NC; severe, 4–6 L NC or non-rebreather; critical, HFNC, NIPPV, or MV). All patients were treated using the institution’s treatment algorithm, which included consideration of tocilizumab for severe and critical disease. The most common cytokine elevations among all patients included IL-6, sIL2R, IFN-γ, and IL-10; patients who received tocilizumab had higher incidence of IL-6 and sIL2R elevations. Pre-tocilizumab IL-6 levels increased with disease severity (p = .0151). Both IL-6 and sIL2R levels significantly increased after administration of tocilizumab in all severity groups; IL-10 levels decreased in severe (p = .0203), but not moderate or critical, patients after they received tocilizumab. Cluster analysis revealed association between higher admission IL-6, sIL2R, and CRP levels and disease severity. Mean IL-6, sIL2R, and D-dimer were associated with mortality, and tocilizumab-treated patients with elevated IL-6, IL-10, and D-dimer were more likely to also receive glucocorticoids. Accessible clinical cytokine panels may be useful for monitoring response to treatment in COVID-19. The increase in sIL2R post-tocilizumab, despite administration of glucocorticoids, may indicate the need for combination therapy in order to modulate more than one hyperinflammatory pathway in COVID-19. We also discuss the role of cytokines as potential biomarkers for use of adjunct glucocorticoid therapy.","Azmy, Veronica; Kaman, Kelsey; Tang, Daiwei; Zhao, Hongyu; Dela Cruz, Charles; Topal, Jeffrey E.; Malinis, Maricar; Price, Christina C.",J Clin Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-020-00949-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33459964/,478

The primary objectives of the present study were to investigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the parents of pediatric cancer patients, and the level of stress, anxiety, and the child’s quality of life perceived by the parents during the COVID-19 epidemic. The parents of 45 consecutive children with solid and hematological tumors were enrolled. Four questionnaires (Impact of Event Scale-Revised – IES-R; Perceived Stress Scale – PSS; Spielberger State – Trait Anxiety Inventory – STAI-Y; Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory – PedsQL) were administered to the parents at the beginning of the pandemic lockdown. A 75% of parents exhibited remarkable levels of anxiety, with 60 subjects in state scale and 45 subjects in trait scale having scores that reached and exceeded the STAI-Y cut off. The bivariate matrix of correlation found a significant positive correlation between the IES-R and PSS scores (r = 0.55, P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between the PSS and PedsQL (emotional needs) scale (P < 0.001) and a negative correlation between IES-R and STAI-Y (P < 0.001).

Sixty-four participants took part in an online expressive writing project, and a total of 167 writings were collected together with some self-report evaluations on emotions and physical sensations. A linguistic analysis through two different sets of computerized linguistic measures was conducted on the collected writings in order to study the linguistic markers of emotion regulation and elaboration. Results indicated that online expressive writing has helped respondents to get more in touch with the intense emotions that were experienced following the upheavals they witnessed. Writing even only once or twice helped, particularly those respondents who had at least one COVID-19 patient among close friends or relatives. Their writings showed an intense emotional involvement together with the ability to reflect and reorganize the personal meaning of the events and emotions experienced.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 259 patients admitted to our hospitals in Rhode Island to examine differences in baseline characteristics (demographics and comorbidities) as well as presenting symptoms, signs, labs, and imaging findings that predicted disease progression and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Patients with severe COVID-19 were more likely to be older (p = 0.02), Black (47.2% vs. 32.0%, p = 0.04), admitted from a nursing facility (33.0% vs. 17.9%, p = 0.006), have diabetes (53.9% vs. 30.4%, p<0.001), or have COPD (15.4% vs. 6.6%, p = 0.02). In multivariate regression, Black race (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1–3.9) and diabetes (aOR 2.2, 95%CI: 1.3–3.9) were independent predictors of severe disease, while older age (aOR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01–1.07), admission from a nursing facility (aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1–6.7), and hematological co-morbidities predicted mortality (aOR 3.4, 95% CI 1.1–10.0). In the first 24 hours, respiratory symptoms (aOR 7.0, 95% CI: 1.4–34.1), hypoxia (aOR 19.9, 95% CI: 2.6–152.5), and hypotension (aOR 2.7, 95% CI) predicted progression to severe disease, while tachypnea (aOR 8.7, 95% CI: 1.1–71.7) and hypotension (aOR 9.0, 95% CI: 3.1–26.1) were associated with increased in-hospital mortality.

It has been shown that the development of potent neutralizing humoral immunity against SARS CoV-2 leads to an increased probability of survival. However, the question of whether immunocompromised patients develop antibodies has not yet been sufficiently investigated; (2) Methods: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were examined in hemodialysis patients on the waiting list for kidney transplantation as well as patients after kidney transplantation. Patients were interviewed about symptoms and comorbidities, BMI, and smoking history; (3) Results: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found in 16 out of 259 patients (6%). The trend of infections here reflects the general course of infection in Germany with a peak in November/December of 2020. Remarkably, patients on the waiting list experienced only mild disease. In contrast, transplanted patients had to be hospitalized but recovered rapidly from COVID-19. Most interesting is that all immunosuppressed patients developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 after infection; (4) Conclusions: Even with extensive hygiene concepts, an above-average number of patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the second wave of infections in Germany. Because SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered the formation of antibodies even in these immunocompromised patients, we expect vaccination to be effective in this group of patients. Thus, dialysis patients and patients after kidney transplantation should be given high priority in vaccination programs.","Boedecker, Simone C.; Klimpke, Pascal; Kraus, Daniel; Runkel, Stefan; Galle, Peter R.; Koch, Martina; Weinmann-Menke, Julia",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10040429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33916836/,478

The cause of this cytokine rampage is yet not known. Based on recent epidemiological evidence, we hypothesized that CD80/86 signaling is essential for this hyperinflammation, and that blocking this proinflammatory axis could be an effective therapeutic approach to protect against severe COVID-19. Here we provide exploratory evidence that abatacept, a drug that blocks CD80/86 co-stimulation, produces changes at the systemic level that are highly antagonistic of the proinflammatory processes elicited by COVID-19. Using RNA-seq from blood samples from a longitudinal cohort of n = 38 rheumatic patients treated with abatacept, we determined the immunological processes that are significantly regulated by this treatment. We then analyzed available blood RNA-seq from two COVID19 patient cohorts, a very early cohort from the epicenter of the pandemic in China (n = 3 COVID-19 cases and n = 3 controls), and a recent and larger cohort from the USA (n = 49 severe and n = 51 mild COVD-19 patients). We found a highly significant antagonism between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity with the systemic response to abatacept. Analysis of previous single-cell RNA-seq data from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mild and severe COVID-19 patients and controls, reinforce the implication of the CD80/86 proinflammatory axis. Our functional results further support abatacept as a candidate therapeutic approach to prevent severe COVID-19.","Julià, Antonio; Bonafonte-Pardàs, Irene; Gómez, Antonio; López-Lasanta, María; López-Corbeto, Mireia; Martínez-Mateu, Sergio H.; Lladós, Jordi; Rodríguez-Nunez, Iván; Myers, Richard M.; Marsal, Sara",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075090/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90797-0,478

Methods A total of 64 participants completed a 10-item anonymous online questionnaire to assess how their knowledge and applied practical skills improved by participating in online conferences, and whether this education modality adequately addresses challenges for countries with limited access to conferences or training. Results While an overall positive response toward this mode of neurosurgical education was expected, interesting insights were gained from the short-answer section, demonstrating a direct influence on clinical practice through online conference participation.

659528,HSV1 viremia with fulminant hepatitis as opportunistic sequela in severe COVID-19,2021-01-18,"BACKGROUND: Most older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who attain morphologic remission with intensive chemotherapy (IC) will eventually relapse and post-relapse prognosis is dismal. In the pivotal QUAZAR AML-001 trial, oral azacitidine maintenance therapy significantly prolonged overall survival by 9.9 months (P < 0.001) and relapse-free survival by 5.3 months (P < 0.001) compared with placebo in patients with AML in first remission after IC who were not candidates for transplant. Currently, the QUAZAR AML-001 trial provides the most comprehensive safety information associated with oral azacitidine maintenance therapy. Reviewed here are common adverse events (AEs) during oral azacitidine treatment in QUAZAR AML-001, and practical recommendations for AE management based on guidance from international cancer consortiums, regulatory authorities, and the authors’ clinical experience treating patients in the trial. METHODS: QUAZAR AML-001 is an international, placebo-controlled randomized phase 3 study. Patients aged ≥ 55 years with AML and intermediate- or poor-risk cytogenetics at diagnosis, who had attained first complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) within 4 months before study entry, were randomized 1:1 to receive oral azacitidine 300 mg or placebo once-daily for 14 days in repeated 28-day cycles. Safety was assessed in all patients who received ≥ 1 dose of study drug. RESULTS: A total of 469 patients received oral azacitidine (n = 236) or placebo (n = 233). Median age was 68 years. Patients received a median of 12 (range 1–80) oral azacitidine treatment cycles or 6 (1–73) placebo cycles. Gastrointestinal AEs were common and typically low-grade. The most frequent grade 3–4 AEs during oral azacitidine therapy were hematologic events. AEs infrequently required permanent discontinuation of oral azacitidine (13%), suggesting they were effectively managed with use of concomitant medications and oral azacitidine dosing modifications. CONCLUSION: Oral azacitidine maintenance had a generally favorable safety profile. Prophylaxis with antiemetic agents, and blood count monitoring every other week, are recommended for at least the first 2 oral azacitidine treatment cycles, and as needed thereafter.

659674,A Systematic Review of Imaging Studies in Olfactory Dysfunction Secondary to COVID-19,2021-08-30,"Recent executive orders have led some applied behavior analysis (ABA) providers to interpret themselves as “essential personnel” during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we argue against a blanket interpretation that being labeled “essential personnel” means that all in-person ABA services for all clients should continue during the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe this argument holds even if ABA providers are not in a jurisdiction currently under an active shelter-at-home or related order. First, we provide a brief description of risks associated with continued in-person ABA service delivery, as well as risks associated with the temporary suspension of services or the transition to remote ABA service delivery. For many clients, continued in-person service delivery carries a significant risk of severe harm to the client, family and caregivers, staff, and a currently overburdened health care system. In these situations, ABA providers should temporarily suspend services or transition to telehealth or other forms of remote service delivery until information from federal, state, and local health care experts deems in-person contact safe. In rare cases, temporary suspension of services or a transition to remote service delivery may place the client or others at risk of significant harm. In these situations, in-person services should likely continue, and ongoing assessment and risk mitigation are essential.","Cox, David J.; Plavnick, Joshua B.; Brodhead, Matthew T.",Behav Anal Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32328220/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40617-020-00430-1,478

Despite several measures undertaken to limit the socio-economic effect of coronavirus, various challenges remain pervasive, and one such challenge is mental health, particularly depression and anxiety. Therefore, this study examines the prevalence and determinants of depression and anxiety in Malaysian population during third wave of COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out via social media platforms and 1544 Malaysians were selected. The level of depression was assessed by Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9) and scored accordingly for categorization. Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used as a self-assessment survey to quantify the level of anxiety of persons experiencing anxiety-related symptoms. Percentage distribution and logistic regression analysis were used in the data analysis. RESULTS: Results showed that one-fourth (25.1%) of the participants had severe depressive symptoms. Almost one-sixth (18.7%) had mild depressive symptoms and one-third (34.1%) had mild to moderate anxiety symptoms. Age, gender, and friends infected with virus were the three important predictors of depression and anxiety. The odds of having depression (OR = 1.44; C·I. = 1.32–1.62) and anxiety (OR = 1.36; C·I. = 1.27–1.47) were significantly higher among females than in males. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of the study participants were facing mild to severe depression and anxiety symptoms which is very alarming as the pandemic is still now increasing across the country. Immediate interventions including community counselling programmes, TV and social media campaigns are urgently needed to reduce the psychological stress among the Malaysian population.","Marzo, Roy Rillera; Vinay, Vineet; Bahari, Rafidah; Chauhan, Shekhar; Ming, Deborah Anak Fo; Nelson Fernandez, Stephanie Fernandez A/P.; Johnson, Colin Cornelius Pereira; Thivakaran, Agkesh Qumar A/L; Rahman, Mohammad Meshbahur; Goel, Sonu",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213398421001767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34549098/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2021.100868; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213398421001767?v=s5,478

However, there is a lack of evidence on adolescent risk perceptions regarding the link between vaping and susceptibility to contracting COVID-19. This study examined the level of perceived COVID-19 risk due to vaping among at-risk adolescents. A sample (N = 1,251) of adolescents aged 13 to 17 and susceptible to future vaping were recruited through Qualtrics to participate in an online survey. More than two thirds of the sample (68.34%) reported that vaping would increase one’s risk of contracting COVID-19. Ordinal logistic regression showed that this risk perception was positively associated with perceived prevalence of vaping among peers (AOR = 1.186, 95%CI = 1.019–1.382) and prior exposure to vaping product advertising (AOR = 1.371, 95%CI = 1.221–1.539), and negatively associated with past 30-day vaping (AOR = 0.579, 95%CI = 0.406-0.825) and number of closest friends who vaped (AOR = 0.873, 95%CI = 0.779-0.978). Further analysis stratified by past 30-day vaping showed that, among those who vaped in the past 30 days, vaping-related covid risk perception was positively associated with susceptibility to future vaping (AOR = 1.562, 95%CI = 1.161–2.101) and sensation-seeking (AOR = 1.212, 95%CI = 1.003–1.463). These results are open to different interpretations because of the cross-sectional nature of the data.

660159,"Face masks, respiratory patients and COVID-19",2020-09-29,"Abstract Although ozone-induced epithelial injury in vivo has been morphologically characterized, effects of gaseous oxidants on respiratory epithelium in organ culture, where tissue organization is maintained but systemic influences are eliminated, have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we exposed tracheal organ cultures from rats to 95% oxygen and 1 ppm ozone, alone and in combination, to determine (1) whether epithelial responses to ozone similar to those observed in vivo occur in airways separated from systemic physiologic, secretory, and inflammatory reactions; (2) whether concentrations of oxygen sufficient to potentially cause oxidant injury result in morphologic epithelial alterations similar to those that occur in ozone toxicity; and (3) if the combined oxidant insult of oxygen and ozone results in more severe damage to the tracheal epithelium than occurs with ozone in air. Tracheal organ cultures were exposed to filtered air and 5% carbon dioxide; filtered air, 5% carbon dioxide, and 1 ppm ozone; 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide; or 95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and 1 ppm ozone for 96 hr. Light- and quantitative electron-microscopic evaluation showed that epithelia to 1 ppm ozone in air exhibited loss of ciliated cells and ciliated cell damage. The epithelia exposed to 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide were pseudostratified, columnar, ciliated, and hyperplastic. Epithelia exposed to 95% oxygen plus 1 ppm ozone were stratified and nonciliated or very sparsely ciliated. The predominant cell types in epithelia exposed to oxygen plus ozone were serous cells and metaplastic cells, and focal aggregates of adherent necrotic cells were present. We conclude that there was a synergism between oxygen and ozone exposure leading to enhanced epithelial injury and metaplasia.","Nikula, Kristen J.; Wilson, Dennis W.",Fundamental and Applied Toxicology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/027205909090169K; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2373293/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/027205909090169K,478
660603,Association of consciousness impairment and mortality in people with COVID‐19,2021-05-24,"PURPOSE: During the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, radiology departments faced a substantial increase in chest CT admissions coupled with the novel demand for quantification of pulmonary opacities. This article describes how our clinic implemented an automated software solution for this purpose into an established software platform in 10 days. The underlying hypothesis was that modern academic centers in radiology are capable of developing and implementing such tools by their own efforts and fast enough to meet the rapidly increasing clinical needs in the wake of a pandemic. METHOD: Deep convolutional neural network algorithms for lung segmentation and opacity quantification on chest CTs were trained using semi-automatically and manually created ground-truth (N(total) = 172). The performance of the in-house method was compared to an externally developed algorithm on a separate test subset (N = 66). RESULTS: The final algorithm was available at day 10 and achieved human-like performance (Dice coefficient = 0.97). For opacity quantification, a slight underestimation was seen both for the in-house (1.8 %) and for the external algorithm (0.9 %). In contrast to the external reference, the underestimation for the in-house algorithm showed no dependency on total opacity load, making it more suitable for follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of machine learning and a clinically embedded software development platform enabled time-efficient development, instant deployment, and rapid adoption in clinical routine. The algorithm for fully automated lung segmentation and opacity quantification that we developed in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic was ready for clinical use within just 10 days and achieved human-level performance even in complex cases.","Anastasopoulos, Constantinos; Weikert, Thomas; Yang, Shan; Abdulkadir, Ahmed; Schmuelling, Lena; Buehler, Claudia; Paciolla, Fabiano; Sexauer, Raphael; Cyriac, Joshy; Nesic, Ivan; Twerenbold, Raphael; Bremerich, Jens; Stieltjes, Bram; Sauter, Alexander W.; Sommer, Gregor",Eur J Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32927416/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0720048X20304228; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0720048X20304228?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109233,478

The research team applied a participatory action research approach to work with residents to design and implement the Seeding Plan, a contactless community gardening program. The authors carried out a study to compare the everyday conditions reflecting residents’ mental health of the three subject groups during the pandemic: the participants of the Seeding Plan (Group A), the non-participants living in the same communities that had implemented the Seeding Plan (Group B), and the non-participants in other communities (Group C). According to the results, group A showed the best mental health among the three; Group B, positively influenced by seeding activities, was better than Group C. The interview results also confirmed that the community connections established through gardening activities have a significant impact on maintaining a positive social mentality under extraordinary circumstances. From this, the study concluded that gardening activities can improve people’s mental health, effectively resist negative impacts, and it is a convenient tool with spreading influence on the entire community, so as to support the collective response to public health emergencies in a bottom-up direction by the community.","Kou, Huaiyun; Zhang, Sichu; Li, Wenjia; Liu, Yuelai",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34207721/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126243,478

Many U.S. nursing homes have been devastated by the COVID‐19 pandemic, yet little has been described regarding the typical disease course in this population. The objective of this study is to describe and identify patterns in the disease course of nursing home residents infected with COVID‐19. SETTING AND METHODS: This is a case series of 74 residents with COVID‐19 infection in a nursing home in central Indiana between March 28 and June 17, 2020. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record and from nursing home medical director tracking notes from the time of the index infection through August 31, 2020. The clinical authorship team reviewed the data to identify patterns in the disease course of the residents. RESULTS: The most common symptoms were fever, hypoxia, anorexia, and fatigue/malaise. The duration of symptoms was extended, with an average of over 3 weeks. Of those infected 25 died; 23 of the deaths were considered related to COVID‐19 infection. A subset of residents with COVID‐19 infection experienced a rapidly progressive, fatal course. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Nursing home residents infected with COVID‐19 from the facility we studied experienced a prolonged disease course regardless of the severity of their symptoms, with implications for the resources needed to care for and support of these residents during active infection and post‐disease. Future studies should combine data from nursing home residents across the country to identify the risk factors for disease trajectories identified in this case series.","Carnahan, Jennifer L.; Lieb, Kristi M.; Albert, Lauren; Wagle, Kamal; Kaehr, Ellen; Unroe, Kathleen T.",J Am Geriatr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34058012/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17308,478

The necessity of this critical step before analytical identification and diagnosis of viral infections is paramount to screening programs and to identifying and monitoring epidemics and pandemics. With molecular assays rapidly evolving into routine practice, clinical laboratories face several challenges, including presence of small amounts of viral nucleic acids in abundant levels of genomic DNA and total RNA, processing of various sample types, and carry-over of polymerase chain reaction inhibitors, which could significantly affect polymerase chain reaction and microarray results. MagaZorb nucleic acid isolation technology overcomes these challenges and offers a simple and reliable method for isolation of highquality and high-yield nucleic acids. Although the MagaZorb technology is readily adaptable to automated platforms, it is also well suited to laboratories in remote areas of resource-poor countries, because a simple magnet is the only device required to perform the procedure manually. Performance characteristics and clinical application of the MagaZorb technology are briefly described here.","Nargessi, Dokhi; Ou, Chin-Yih",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20225944/; https://doi.org/10.1086/650391,478

661269,HIV self-testing with digital supports as the new paradigm: A systematic review of global evidence (2010–2021),2021-08-13,"Tuberculosis (TB) infection, caused by the airborne pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), resulted in almost 1.4 million deaths in 2019 and the number of deaths is predicted to increase by 20% over the next 5 years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Upon reaching the alveolar space, M.tb comes in close contact with the lung mucosa before and after its encounter with host alveolar compartment cells. Our previous studies show that homeostatic innate soluble components of the alveolar lining fluid (ALF) can quickly alter the cell envelope surface of M.tb upon contact, defining subsequent M.tb-host cell interactions and infection outcomes in vitro and in vivo. We also demonstrated that ALF from 60+ year old elders (E-ALF) vs. healthy 18- to 45-year-old adults (A-ALF) is dysfunctional with loss of homeostatic capacity and impaired innate soluble responses linked to high local oxidative stress. In this study, a targeted transcriptional assay demonstrates that M.tb exposure to human ALF alters the expression of its cell envelope genes. Specifically, our results indicate that A-ALF-exposed M.tb upregulates cell envelope genes associated with lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism, as well as genes associated with redox homeostasis and transcriptional regulators. Conversely, M.tb exposure to E-ALF shows lesser transcriptional response, with most of the M.tb genes unchanged or downregulated. Overall, this study indicates that M.tb responds and adapts to the lung alveolar environment upon contact, and that the host ALF status determined by factors such as age might play an important role in determining infection outcome.","Allué-Guardia, Anna; Garcia-Vilanova, Andreu; M.

Overall, there were 3 key components to ODANN’s development phase, namely: (i) data hydration and pre-processing were performed on COVID-19 related Twitter data ranging between 23 January 2020 and 10 May 2020, which amounted to over 100 million Tweets written in English language; (ii) multiple NLP features extraction methods were subsequently leveraged to encode the hydrated Twitter data into useful semantic word vectors for training ODANN under an optimal set of hyperparameters; and (iii) historical time-series data of defined characteristics were also assimilated into ODANN’s selected hidden layer(s) to model the G parameter daily with a lead-time of 1 day. By far, our experimental results demonstrated that by adopting a rolling time-window size of 5 days, with respect to the number of historical time-series records for assimilating different data features, enabled ODANN to outperform other traditional time-series models and recent studies, in terms of the computed RMSE and MAE scores attained from the model’s testing step.

The second and third methods employed four cartridges, with cartridges being rotated every 7 and 9–10 days, respectively. The retention time for methods 1, 2, and 3 was 21, 28, and 38 days, respectively. After observation spanning 1 year, it was found that the cartridge digester was capable of generating a stable amount of biogas for energy without biomass floating or effluent discharging issues.

664452,Strategies to control COVID-19 and future pandemics in Africa and around the globe,2020-04-07,"COVID-19 has led to mental health adversities worldwide. The current study examined whether daily practice of brief mindfulness training has a beneficial impact on affective well-being, and mitigates the negative impact of exposure to COVID-19 news during the pandemic. Participants were randomly assigned into a mindfulness training (MT) group or a waitlist control (WC) group. Participants in the MT group practiced guided mindfulness meditation for a minimum of 10 min each day for 10 days. Both groups completed questionnaires assessing well-being at baseline and after the 10-day period. We also included four ecological momentary assessments (EMA) interspersed throughout the day to measure fine-grained affective states and recent exposure to COVID-19-related news, which has been linked to negative affect. We observed an increase in positive affect in the MT group compared to the WC group in the post-training assessment. However, no group differences emerged in the other three post-training affective measures of negative affect, anxiety and depression. EMA revealed that the MT group also showed more positive affective valence than the WC group across the 10 days. Notably, the WC group reported more negative affective valence following COVID-19 news exposure, whereas the MT group was not impacted. Taken together, our study indicates brief sessions of guided mindfulness meditation during COVID-19 may boost positive affect and serve as a protective buffer against the negative impact of exposure to COVID-19-related news on affective well-being. These findings highlight the utility of mindfulness meditation as an accessible and cost-effective technique to elevate positive affect amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

For our analysis, we develop a new multiple-channel test of financial market contagion and construct indices of crisis severity in equity markets in order to examine how the transmission of shocks across countries can be related to direct linkages between countries or to common characteristics. Based on network analysis with our proposed multiple-channel test for crises between 2007 and 2021, we find that the Great Recession is the most pervasive across countries, followed by the European sovereign debt crisis and the recent COVID pandemic, with the subprime mortgage crisis being the least pervasive. Our main finding is that similar public, private and external debt characteristics are particularly helpful in explaining the transmission of financial shocks during crises. Fiscal deficits appear more important than current account deficits, while stage of economic development matters more than regional linkages, but none of these indicators is as important as debt.","Hsiao, Cody Yu-Ling; Morley, James",Empir Econ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00181-021-02077-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149150/,478

Methods: In this retrospective single center study, we finally included 245 consecutive patients who confirmed COVID 19 in Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital from January 1 to February 29. Cases were classified as either discharged or dead. Demographic, clinical and laboratory datas were registered, two different nutritional indices were calculated: (i)the Controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score; (ii) prognostic nutritional index (PNI). We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to explore the relationship between nutritional indices and hospital death . Results: 212 of them were discharged and 33 of them died. In hospital mortality was signifcantly higher in the severe group of PNI than in the moderate and normal groups. It was also significantly worse in the severe CONUT group than in the moderate, mild , and normal CONUT groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the CONUT score (odds ratio3.371,95%CI (1.124 10.106), p = 0.030) and PNI(odds ratio 0.721,95% CI(0.581 0.896),P=0.003) were independent predictors of all cause death at an early stage; Multivariate logistic regression analysis also showed that the severe group of PNI was the independent risk predictor of in hospital death(odds ratio 24.225, 95% CI(2.147 273.327), p=0.010).The CONUT score cutoff value was 5.5 (56.00 and 80.81%; AUC 0.753; 95% CI(0.644 0.862);respectively).The PNI cutoff value was 40.58 (81.80 and 66.20%; AUC 0.778; 95% CI(0.686 0.809); respectively).We use PNI and the COUNT score to assess malnutrition, which can have a prognosis effect of COVID 19 patients.

MethodsWe investigated the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive results in seropositive and seronegative healthcare workers (HCWs) attending asymptomatic and symptomatic staff testing at Oxford University Hospitals, UK. Baseline antibody status was determined using anti-spike and/or anti-nucleocapsid IgG assays and staff followed for up to 30 weeks. We used Poisson regression to estimate the relative incidence of PCR-positive results and new symptomatic infection by antibody status, accounting for age, gender and changes in incidence over time. ResultsA total of 12219 HCWs participated and had anti-spike IgG measured, 11052 were followed up after negative and 1246 after positive antibody results including 79 who seroconverted during follow up. 89 PCR-confirmed symptomatic infections occurred in seronegative individuals (0.46 cases per 10,000 days at risk) and no symptomatic infections in those with anti-spike antibodies. Additionally, 76 (0.40/10,000 days at risk) anti-spike IgG seronegative individuals had PCR-positive tests in asymptomatic screening, compared to 3 (0.21/10,000 days at risk) seropositive individuals. Overall, positive baseline anti-spike antibodies were associated with lower rates of PCR-positivity (with or without symptoms) (adjusted rate ratio 0.24 [95%CI 0.08-0.76, p=0.015]). Rate ratios were similar using anti-nucleocapsid IgG alone or combined with anti-spike IgG to determine baseline status.

Transfusion of convalescent plasma collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 is among many approaches being studied as potentially efficacious therapy. We are conducting a prospective, propensity score-matched study assessing the efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion versus standard of care as treatment for severe and/or critical COVID-19. We present here the results of an interim analysis of 316 patients (n=316) enrolled at Houston Methodist hospitals from March 28 to July 6, 2020. Of the 316 transfused patients, 136 met a 28-day outcome and were matched to 251 non-transfused control COVID-19 patients. Matching criteria included age, sex, BMI, comorbidities, and baseline ventilation requirement 48 h from admission, and in a second matching analysis, ventilation status at Day 0. Variability in the timing of transfusion relative to admission and titer of antibodies of plasma transfused allowed for analysis in specific matched cohorts. The analysis showed a significant reduction (P = 0.047) in mortality within 28 days, specifically in patients transfused within 72 h of admission with plasma with an anti-spike protein receptor binding domain titer of ≥1:1350.

We build on both public health considerations, in which engagement, cost and scalability are paramount, and a developmental psychopathology framework (Cicchetti & Toth, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines 50:16–25, 2009), in which the child is considered within the context of the proximal caregiving environment. Whereas existing early preventive models have shown promise in promoting children’s school readiness, the Smart Beginnings model addresses three important barriers that have limited impacts at the individual and/or population level: (1) identification and engagement of vulnerable families; (2) the challenges of scalability at low cost within existing service systems; and (3) tailoring interventions to address the heterogeneity of risk among low-income families. Smart Beginnings takes advantage of the existing platform of pediatric primary care to provide a universal primary prevention strategy for all families (Video Interaction Project) and a targeted secondary/tertiary prevention strategy (Family Check-Up) for families with additional contextual factors. We describe the theory underlying the Smart Beginnings model, some initial findings from its recent application in two cities, and implications for changing social policy to promote school readiness beginning during very early childhood.","Shaw, Daniel S.; Mendelsohn, Alan L.; Morris, Pamela A.",Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34505232/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10567-021-00366-0,478

The Wald test is applied that rejects the null hypothesis and confirms the short- and long-run relationship between the variables. The changes in human development and economic growth are responsible for past and current changes in energy production and corruption that is confirmed through the Error Correction Model (ECM). This paper provides some interesting findings that energy production is contributing positively to human development. Further, energy production contributes negatively to economic growth, while corruption contributes positively to economic growth. These findings will help to make policy measures such as environmental regulation to improve energy efficiency and anti-corruption policies which will improve income level and economic growth of Pakistan economy.","Luqman, Muhammad; Li, Yafei; Khan, Salah Ud-Din; Ahmad, Najid",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14744-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173950/,478

In late 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged and caused the coronaviruses to disease 2019 (COVID-19), leading to the ongoing global outbreak. The other pandemic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), share a considerable level of similarities at genomic and protein levels. However, the differences between them lead to distinct behaviors. These differences result from the accumulation of mutations in the sequence and structure of spike (S) glycoprotein, which plays an essential role in coronavirus infection, pathogenicity, transmission, and evolution. In this review, we brought together many studies narrating a sequence of events and highlighting the differences among S proteins from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. It was performed here, analysis of S protein sequences and structures from the three pandemic coronaviruses pointing out the mutations among them and what they come through. Additionally, we investigated the receptor-binding domain (RBD) from all S proteins explaining the mutation and biological importance of all of them.

HSA acts as the main carrier of fatty acids, recognizes metal ions, affects pharmacokinetics of many drugs, provides the metabolic modification of some ligands, renders potential toxins harmless, accounts for most of the anti-oxidant capacity of human plasma, and displays esterase, enolase, glucuronidase, and peroxidase (pseudo)-enzymatic activities. HSA-based catalysis is physiologically relevant, affecting the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds including proteins, lipids, cholesterol, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and drugs. Catalytic properties of HSA are modulated by allosteric effectors, competitive inhibitors, chemical modifications, pathological conditions, and aging. HSA displays anti-oxidant properties and is critical for plasma detoxification from toxic agents and for pro-drugs activation. The enzymatic properties of HSA can be also exploited by chemical industries as a scaffold to produce libraries of catalysts with improved proficiency and stereoselectivity for water decontamination from poisonous agents and environmental contaminants, in the so called “green chemistry” field.

We therefore investigated whether polymorphisms in the DC-SIGN gene were associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis in an eastern Chinese population. A total of 237 culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis case patients and 244 controls were genotyped for −871A/G and −336A/G by pyrosequencing. Our results suggested that the 2 promoter variants of DC-SIGN gene were not associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis in Chinese. Further analysis showed that the allele -336G was associated with a protective effect against fever in pulmonary tuberculosis patients, but not against cavity formation. In addition, we compared the allelic frequencies of −871A/G and −336A/G in African, Caucasian, and Asian groups.

Throughout history, Sámis have been living close to nature. Working with reindeer husbandry, fishing-farming, hunting, herding, and harvesting for food supplies, has traditionally been an integral part of their lives. Currently, only 2,500 of the ~65,000 Sámis in Norway are operating reindeer husbandry (2019). Most Sámis today work in mainstream jobs, and the fishing-farming culture gradually become more like the mainstream societies where Sámis live. Fieldwork with participant observation and semi-structured interviews carried out at Riddu Riđđu Festivala in the period 2009–2018. In addition, the governing bodies of seven other Sámi festivals have been interviewed. All together 46 in-depth interviews and participant observations conducted, in addition to document analysis of the festivals. The aim was to study how physical and outdoor activities included in the festivals create indigenous people's identities and cultural understanding and how the activities at the festivals might develop climate and environmental awareness. Indigenous festivals and their governing bodies offer many different forms of physical and cultural activities from Sámis and different indigenous peoples to the youth and children taking part. Further, the study shows that important aims for the organizers are to spread the knowledge about Sámis (i.e., local coastal Sámis and regional reindeer/Inland Sámis) and other indigenous peoples, and making environment-friendly festivals. They are trying to educate the children and youth in the cultural practices of their forefathers and foremothers. The manifold of activities offered at the festivals seem to create sustainable ties between persons, which equip the participants with social and cultural capital in addition to networks across festivals organizations internationally. The participants further express that taking part in the festival activities create symbolic capital, due to that they might express their indigeneity at the festivals both for people living in the region and for a greater audience.

The endocrine system ensures that values of essential factors and nutrients such as glucose, electrolytes and vitamins are maintained within threshold values. The immune system resolves local disruptions in tissue homeostasis, caused by pathogens or malfunctioning cells. The immediate goals of these two systems do not always align. The immune system benefits from optimal access to nutrients for itself and restriction of nutrient availability to all other organs to limit pathogen replication. The endocrine system aims to ensure optimal nutrient access for all organs, limited only by the nutrients stores that the body has available. The actual state of homeostatic parameters such as blood glucose levels represents a careful balance based on regulatory signals from the immune and endocrine systems. This state is not static but continuously adjusted in response to changes in the current metabolic needs of the body, the amount of resources it has available and the level of threats it encounters. This balance is maintained by the ability of the immune and endocrine systems to interact and co-regulate systemic metabolism. In context of metabolic disease, this system is disrupted, which impairs functionality of both systems. The failure of the endocrine system to retain levels of nutrients such as glucose within threshold values impairs functionality of the immune system. In addition, metabolic stress of organs in context of obesity is perceived by the immune system as a disruption in local homeostasis, which it tries to resolve by the excretion of factors which further disrupt normal metabolic control. In this chapter, we will discuss how the immune and endocrine systems interact under homeostatic conditions and during infection with a focus on blood glucose regulation. In addition, we will discuss how this system fails in the context of metabolic disease.","Wensveen, Felix M; Šestan, Marko; Turk Wensveen, Tamara; Polić, Bojan",Vitamins and hormones,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34420584/; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.vh.2021.06.009,478
670697,"Spinal anesthesia in COVID-19 patients, more research is needed",2020-04-27,"This research investigated the effects of social isolation on frailty and health outcomes and tested whether these associations varied across different levels of frailty. We performed a multivariate analysis of the first wave of Frailty: A longitudinal study of its expressions (FRéLE) among 1643 Canadian older adults aged 65 years and over. We assessed social isolation using social participation, social networks, and support from various social ties, namely, friends, children, extended family, and partner. Frailty was associated with disability, comorbidity, depression, and cognitive decline. Less social participation was associated with limitations in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), depression, and cognitive decline. The absence of friends was associated with depression and cognitive impairment. Less social support from children and partner was related to comorbidity, depression, and cognitive decline. Overall, social isolation is linked to mental health rather than physical health. The associations of having no siblings, receiving less support from friends, and participating less in social activities with ADL limitations, depression, and cognitive decline were higher among frail than prefrail and robust older adults. This study corroborates the pivotal role of social connectedness, particularly the quality of relationships, on the mental health of older adults. Public health policies on social relationships are paramount to ameliorate the health status of frail older adults.","Mehrabi, Fereshteh; Béland, François",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33572443/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041675,478

670731,Allograft Tissue Safety and Technology,2018-11-26,"PURPOSE: In patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and severe hypercalcemia, parathyroidectomy remains the only curative therapy. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, when many hospital visits are suspended and surgeries cannot be performed, the management of these patients represents a challenging clinical situation. This article presents a literature review and discussion of the pharmacologic management of PHPT and severe hypercalcemia, which can be used as a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic until parathyroidectomy can be performed safely. METHODS: This narrative review was conducted by searching literature on the PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases using the terms primary hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, cinacalcet, bisphosphonates, denosumab, vitamin D, raloxifene, hormone replacement therapy, coronavirus, and COVID-19. FINDINGS: Appropriate monitoring and remote medical follow-up of these patients are essential until the resolution of the pandemic. Cinacalcet is the drug of choice for controlling hypercalcemia, whereas bisphosphonate or denosumab is the drug for improving bone mineral density. Combined therapy with cinacalcet and bisphosphonates or cinacalcet and denosumab should be considered when the effects on serum calcium and bone mineral density are simultaneously desired. IMPLICATIONS: Medical management of PHPT and severe hypercalcemia presents a reasonable alternative for parathyroid surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak and should be instituted until the pandemic ends and surgery can be performed safely.","Alfadhli, Eman M.",Clin Ther,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0149291821001004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149291821001004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33752899/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2021.02.003,478

However, the factors that determine host susceptibility and pathogenicity remain elusive. An increasing number of publications highlight the role of Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in the susceptibility of the host cell to SARS‐CoV‐2. Cleavage of viral spike protein via the host cell's TMPRSS2 enzyme activity mediates viral entry into the host cell. The enzyme synthesis is regulated by the TMPRSS2 gene, which has also been implicated in the entry mechanisms of previously reported Coronavirus infections. In this review, we have investigated the pathogenicity of SARS‐CoV‐2 and disease susceptibility dependence on the TMPRSS2 gene as expressed in various population groups. We further discuss how the differential expression of this gene in various ethnic groups can affect the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and Coronavirus disease (COVID)‐19 outcomes. Moreover, promising new TMPRSS2 protease blockers and inhibitors are discussed for COVID‐19 treatment.","Abbasi, Asim Z.; Kiyani, Dania A.; Hamid, Syeda M.; Saalim, Muhammad; Fahim, Ammad; Jalal, Nasir",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33638460/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26911,478

671966,A Meta-Meta-Analysis: evaluation of Meta-Analyses Published in the effectiveness of cardiovascular comorbidities on the severity of COVID-19,2021-01-23,"Aim: Using a comparison of digital teaching in medicine before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, the aim of the study was to examine how ad hoc digitization has changed (1) the design of digital teaching, (2) the attitudes toward and the capabilities of digital teaching and learning and (3) the future importance of individual digital teaching elements. Methods: Students and lecturers from the Medical Faculty of Ulm were asked to voluntarily participate in online surveys during the summer semesters of 2019 and 2020. The data was subsequently analyzed from a longitudinal and cross-sectional view descriptively as well as by using t-tests and Chi(2)-tests. In addition, using regression analyses, the results were controlled for associations with age, study progress, and media affinity. Results: In the summer semester 2019, 163 students (6.1% response rate) and 56 lecturers (11.5%) participated in the surveys. In the following year, the participation increased to 285 students (10.4%) and 64 lecturers (12.8%). Video-based teaching elements such as videoconferencing and lecture recordings were increasingly used after the COVID-19 outbreak and considered more significant for future teaching. In contrast, virtual reality, augmented reality and 360°-videos, grouped under the term extended reality (XR), are descriptively becoming less important. Most lecturers would like to teach more digitally even after the pandemic but fear a decrease in learning effectiveness and contact with students, who tend to prefer asynchronous learning opportunities. Conclusion: Video-based teaching elements proved to be a low-threshold and time-efficient solution during the lockdown and were also recommended for future use. The XR technology has been put on the back burner for the time being, but in view of the increased digital teaching motivation and capabilities, it can be assumed that lecturers will recognize and use the potential of XR as soon as they have the freedom to design innovative teaching again.","Speidel, Robert; Schneider, Achim; Körner, Jasmin; Grab-Kroll, Claudia; Öchsner, Wolfgang",GMS J Med Educ,https://doi.org/10.3205/zma001497; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34651059/,478
672062,Role of multimodality imaging in evaluation of cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19,2020-10-13,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which medical rehabilitation requests decreased due to the pandemic in Germany. DESIGN: Data were retrieved from the German Pension Insurance which is the main provider for rehabilitation of working-aged people in Germany. Our data represented all medical rehabilitation requests in 2019 and 2020. These requests have to be approved to use a rehabilitation program. We used a difference-in-differences model to determine the reduction in rehabilitation requests attributable to the pandemic. SETTING: General community PARTICIPANTS: We included 1,621,840 rehabilitation requests from working-aged people across Germany in 2019 and 1,391,642 rehabilitation requests in 2020. INTERVENTION: Medical rehabilitation in inpatient or outpatient facilities MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Number of medical rehabilitation requests RESULTS: The number of medical rehabilitation requests decreased by 14.5% due to the pandemic (incidence rate ratio, IRRâ¯=â¯0.855; 95% CI: 0.851 to 0.859). The decline in requests was more pronounced among women and in Western Germany than among men and in Eastern Germany. The reduction in requests affected non-post-acute rehabilitations more clearly than post-acute rehabilitation services. After the pandemic declaration by the German Bundestag in March 2020, the reduction in requests was initially strongly associated with the regional incidence of infection. This association weakened in the following months. CONCLUSION: The reduction in requests will have a significant impact on the number of completed rehabilitation services. For many people with chronic diseases, failure to provide medical rehabilitation increases the risk of disease progression.","Bethge, Prof Dr Matthias; Fauser, David; Zollmann, Pia; Streibelt, Dr Marco",Arch. phys. med. rehabil,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2021.07.791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34371015/,478

Our extensive cognitive assessment for a phase-2 clinical trial, Physical Activity and Alzheimer's Disease–2 (PAAD-2), was also paused in March 2020. It was important to identify strategies to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission during our testing, which initially required substantial human speech and close person-to-person contact for test directions and instant feedback on paper/pencil tests. Given current understanding of the COVID-19 transmission, we dramatically adjusted the testing protocol to minimize the production of speech droplets and allow social distancing while maintaining the integrity of testing. We adopted state-of-the-art speech synthesis and computerization techniques to create an avatar to speak on behalf of the experimenter for all verbal instructions/feedback, used a document camera to observe the paper/pencil tests from the required distances, and automated the testing sequence and timing. This paper aims 1) to describe an innovative laboratory-based cognitive testing protocol for a completely contact-free, computer-speaking, and semi-automated administration; and 2) to evaluate the integrity of the modified protocol (n = 37) compared with the original protocol (n = 32). We have successfully operated the modified protocol since July 2020 with no evidence of COVID-19 transmission during testing, and data support that the modified protocol is robust and captures data identical to the original protocol. This transition of data collection methods has been critical during the pandemic and will be useful in future studies to mitigate the risk of contagious disease transmission and standardize laboratory-based psychological tests.

The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent public health measures taken to combat it burdened the students’ life with additional dramatic psychological impacts. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological impacts that affected the university students in Egypt during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was sent to the Egyptian university students via all means of online communication during the first week of May 2020 by using a non-probability snowball sampling. A survey included a short version Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and socio-demographic data. Overall, 70.5, 53.6 and 47.8% of Egyptian students had depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. Being a female, having a relative or acquaintance infected with COVID-19, having a preexisting chronic disease and lacking of psychological support from families, community and universities increase the risk of depression, anxiety and stress among Egyptian students. Being a medical student is associated with depression while, spending more time to follow news of COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased anxiety. Egyptian students experience varying levels of psychological disturbance during COVID-19 pandemic.

The Attitudes About COVID-19 and Health (ATTACH) study focuses on understanding attitudes and beliefs whilst considering the impact on mental and physical health and the influence of broader demographic and geographic factors on attitudes, beliefs, and mental health burden. OBJECTIVE In this assessment of our first wave of data collection, we provide baseline cohort descriptives of ATTACH study participants in the United Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA), and Mexico. Additionally, we assess responses to daily poll questions related to COVID-19 and conduct a cross-sectional analysis of baseline assessments collected in the UK between June 26 and October 31, 2020. METHODS The ATTACH study uses smartphone-app technology and online survey data collection. Participants completed poll questions twice daily related to COVID-19 and a monthly survey assessing mental health, social isolation, physical health, and quality of life. Poll question responses were graphed using 95% Clopper-Pearson (exact) tests with 95% confidence intervals. Pearson correlations, hierarchical linear regression analyses, and generalized linear models assessed relationships, predictors of self-reported outcomes, and group differences, respectively. RESULTS By October 31, 2020, 1405, 80, and 90 participants had consented to participate in the UK, USA, and Mexico, respectively. Descriptive data for the UK daily poll questions indicated that participants generally followed social distancing measures, but worry and negative impacts on families increased as the pandemic progressed. Although participants generally reported feeling that the reasons for current measures had been made clear, there was low trust that the government was doing everything in its power to meet public needs. In the UK, 1282 participants also completed a monthly survey (95% white, 72% female, 21% key or essential workers). Nineteen percent of UK participants reported a pre-existing mental health disorder, 31% reported a pre-existing chronic medical illness, and 35% were over 65. Fifty-seven percent of participants reported being more sedentary since the pandemic began, and 41% reported reduced access to medical care. Those with poorer mental health outcomes lived in more deprived neighborhoods, in larger households (ps < .05), had more pre-existing mental health disorders and medical conditions, and were younger than 65 years (all ps < .001). CONCLUSIONS Communities who have been exposed to additional harm during the COVID-19 pandemic were experiencing worse mental outcomes. Factors including having a medical condition, or living in a deprived neighborhood or larger household were associated with heightened risk. Future longitudinal studies should investigate the link between COVID-19 exposure, mental health, and sociodemographic and residential characteristics.

High-affinity neutralizing antibody is important for controlling infection, which is closely regulated by follicular helper T (Tfh) cells. Tfh cells play a central role in promoting germinal center reactions and driving cognate B cell differentiation for antibody secretion. Available studies indicate a close relationship between virus-specific Tfh cell-mediated immunity and SARS-CoV-2 infection progression. Although several lines of evidence have suggested that Tfh cells contribute to the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection by eliciting neutralizing antibody productions, further studies are needed to elucidate Tfh-mediated effector mechanisms in anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity.

673636,Assessment of Burnout Levels before and during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Web-Based Survey by the (Italian) Association of Medical Endocrinologists (AME),2021,"OBJECTIVE: Recruitment to clinical research in the National Health Service remains challenging. One barrier is accessing patients to discuss research participation. Two general approaches are used in the United Kingdom to facilitate this: an ‘opt-in’ approach (when clinicians communicate research opportunities to patients) and an ‘opt-out’ approach (all patients have the right to be informed of relevant research opportunities). No evidence-based data are available, however, to inform the decision about which approach is preferable. This study aimed to collect information from ‘opt-in’ and ‘opt-out’ Trusts and identify which of the two approaches is optimal for ensuring National Health Service patients are given opportunities to discuss research participation. METHOD: This sequential mixed methods study comprised three phases: (1) an Appreciative Inquiry across UK Trusts, (2) online surveys and (3) focus groups with National Health Service staff and patients at a representative mental health Trust. RESULTS: The study was conducted between June and October 2019. Out of seven National Health Service Mental Health Trusts contacted (three ‘opt-out’ and four ‘opt-in’), only four took part in phase 1 of the study and three of them were ‘opt-out’ Trusts. Benefits of an ‘opt-out’ approach included greater inclusivity of patients and the removal of research gatekeepers, while the involvement of research-active clinicians and established patient–clinician relationships were cited as important to ‘opt-in’ success. Phases 2 and 3 were conducted at a different Trust (Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust) which was using an ‘opt-in’ approach. Of 333 staff and member survey responders, 267 (80.2%) favoured moving to an ‘opt-out’ approach (phase 2). Nineteen staff and 16 patients and carers participated in focus groups (phase 3). Concern was raised by staff regarding the lack of time for clinical research, with clinical work taking precedence over research; patients were concerned about a lack of research activity; all considered research to be beneficial and were supportive of a move to ‘opt-out’. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that ‘opt-out’ is more beneficial than ‘opt-in’, with the potential to vastly increase patient access to research opportunities and to enable greater equality of information provision for currently marginalised groups. This should ensure that healthcare research is more representative of the entire population, including those with a mental health diagnosis.","Henshall, Catherine; Potts, Jennifer; Walker, Sophie; Hancock, Mark; Underwood, Mark; Broughton, Nick; Ede, Roger; Kernot, Catherine; O’Neill, Lorcan; Geddes, John R; Cipriani, Andrea",Aust N Z J Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33225713/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0004867420973261,478

674680,Synopsis of an integrated guidance for enhancing the care of familial hypercholesterolaemia: an Australian perspective,2021-02-04,"Summary Proteins that are concentrated in specific compartments of the endomembrane system in order to exert their organelle-specific function must possess specific localization signals that prevent their transport to distal regions of the exocytic pathway. Some resident proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that are known to escape with low efficiency from this organelle to a post ER compartment are recognized by a recycling receptor and brought back to their site of residence. Other ER proteins, however, appear to be retained in the ER by mechanisms that operate in the organelle itself. The mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) is a protein complex that effects the cotranslational N-glycosylation of newly synthesized polypeptides, and is composed of at least four rough ER-specific membrane proteins: ribophorins I and II (RI and RII), OST48, and Dad1. The mechanism(s) by which the subunits of this complex are retained in the ER are not well understood. In an effort to identify the domains within RII responsible for its ER localization we have studied the fate of chimeric proteins in which one or more RII domains were replaced by the corresponding ones of the Tac antigen, the latter being a well characterized plasma membrane protein that lacks intrinsic ER retention signals and serves to provide a neutral framework for the identification of retention signals in other proteins. We found that the luminal domain of RII by itself does not contain retention information, while the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains contain independent ER localization signals. We also show that the retention function of the transmembrane domain is strengthened by the presence of a flanking luminal region consisting of 15 amino acids.","Fu, Jie; Pirozzi, Gregorio; Sanjay, Archana; Levy, Robert; Chen, Yanru; De Lemos-Chiarandini, Carmen; Sabatini, David; Kreibich, Gert",European Journal of Cell Biology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0171933504700254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10826490/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0171933504700254,478
674769,Cardiovascular Implications and Therapeutic Considerations in COVID-19 Infection,2020-06-13,"This paper reports the first genomic RNA sequence of a field strain feline coronavirus (FCoV). Viral RNA was isolated at post mortem from the jejunum and liver of a cat with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). A consensus sequence of the jejunum-derived genomic RNA (FCoV C1Je) was determined from overlapping cDNA fragments produced by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification. RT-PCR products were sequenced by a reiterative sequencing strategy and the genomic RNA termini were determined using a rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR strategy. The FCoV C1Je genome was found to be 29,255 nucleotides in length, excluding the poly(A) tail. Comparison of the FCoV C1Je genomic RNA sequence with that of the laboratory strain FCoV FIP virus (FIPV) 79-1146 showed that both viruses have a similar genome organisation and predictions made for the open reading frames and cis-acting elements of the FIPV 79-1146 genome hold true for FCoV C1Je. In addition, the sequence of the 3′-proximal third of the liver derived genomic RNA (FCoV C1Li), which encompasses the structural and accessory protein genes of the virus, was also determined. Comparisons of the enteric (jejunum) and non-enteric (liver) derived viral RNA sequences revealed 100% nucleotide identity, a finding that questions the well accepted ‘internal mutation theory’ of FIPV pathogenicity.","Dye, Charlotte; Siddell, Stuart G.",J Feline Med Surg,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X0600177X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17363313/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X0600177X,478
675087,COVID-19 Infection-Related Coagulopathy and Viscoelastic Methods: A Paradigm for Their Clinical Utility in Critical Illness,2020-10-14,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare acquired infections (HAIs) cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Copper appears to have strong antimicrobial properties under laboratory conditions. AIM: We conducted a systematic review to examine the potential effect of copper treating of commonly touched surfaces in healthcare facilities. METHODS: We included controlled trials comparing the effect of copper-treated surfaces (furniture or bed linens) in hospital rooms versus standard rooms on hospital acquired infections (HAIs). Two reviewers independently screened retrieved articles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. The primary outcome was the occurrence of healthcare acquired infections. FINDINGS: We screened 638 records; 7 studies comprising 12362 patients were included. From risk of bias assessment, all included studies were judged to be at high risk in ≥2 of the 7 domains of bias. All 7 included studies reported the effect of various copper-treated surfaces on HAIs. Overall, we found low quality evidence of a potential clinical importance that copper-treated hard surfaces and/or bed linens and clothes reduced healthcare acquired infections by 27% (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.94; I(2) = 44%, p-value = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Given the clinical and economic costs of healthcare acquired infections, the potentially protective effect of copper-treated surfaces appears important. However, the current evidence is insufficient to make a strong positive recommendation. However, it would appear worthwhile and urgent to conduct larger scale publicly funded clinical trials of the impact of copper coating.","Albarqouni, Loai; Byambasuren, Oyuka; Clark, Justin; Scott, Anna Mae; Looke, David; Glasziou, Paul",J Hosp Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.09.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120304205?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670120304205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916212/,478

This study was conducted for simultaneous detection and identification of 14 respiratory viruses in Huizhou using real-time PCR. In total, viruses were detected in 48.66 % of ILI patient samples, in which influenza virus (19.98 %) was the most commonly detected, followed by rhinovirus (7.46 %), human coronaviruses (3.63 %), human metapneumovirus (3.06 %), parainfluenza virus (3.06 %), respiratory syncytial virus (2.39 %), adenovirus (2.29 %), and human bocavirus (1.43 %). Co-infections occurred in 5.35 % of all tested specimens and 11.00 % (56/509) of infected patients. Children under 5 years and adults older than 60 years were more likely to have one or more detectable viruses associated with their ILI (OR=1.75, 95 % CI: 1.37; 2.23). Influenza virus was detected during each month of each year, and increased viral activity was observed in 2013. Infections with adenovirus and human metapneumovirus had characteristic seasonal patterns. No significant differences were found in positive the rate between the gender groups, while significantly differences in positive rate were found among the different age groups (P-value<0.001). This study confirmed that multiple respiratory viruses may circulate concurrently in the population and play an important role in the etiology of ILI. The most frequent symptoms associated with respiratory viruses were sore throat, rhinorrhea and headache. This information needs to be considered by clinicians when treating patients presenting with ILI, and it could serve as a reference for government officers when designing and implementing effective intervention plans.","Ju, Xiongfei; Fang, Qiaoyun; Zhang, Jian; Xu, Angao; Liang, Lihuan; Ke, Changwen",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610554/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-014-2035-1,478

USP2, a cysteine protease and a member of the ubiquitin specific protease family, is overexpressed in prostate cancer and stabilizes fatty acid synthase, which has been associated with the malignancy of some aggressive prostate cancers. Here, we report the structure of the human USP2 catalytic domain in complex with ubiquitin. Ubiquitin uses two major sites for the interaction with the protease. Both sites are required simultaneously, as shown by USP2 inhibition assays with peptides and ubiquitin mutants. In addition, a layer of ordered water molecules mediates key interactions between ubiquitin and USP2. As several of those molecules are found at identical positions in the previously solved USP7/ubiquitin-aldehyde complex structure, we suggest a general mechanism of water-mediated ubiquitin recognition by USPs.","Renatus, Martin; Parrado, Shirley Gil; D'Arcy, Allan; Eidhoff, Ulf; Gerhartz, Bernd; Hassiepen, Ulrich; Pierrat, Benoit; Riedl, Ralph; Vinzenz, Daniela; Worpenberg, Susanne; Kroemer, Markus",Structure,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0969212606002954; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212606002954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16905103/,478

As front-line health care workers, this crisis significantly affected emergency medicine residents and their respective programs. We sought to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the education and training of emergency medicine residents across the United States and Puerto Rico. Methods: A survey was sent out to Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited United States and Puerto Rico emergency medicine residency programs (264 programs at the time) via email correspondence to the Program Directors and the Program Coordinators. The survey stratified program type (practice setting, length of training, institution type, moonlighting allowed) and impact of COVID-19 on residents (off-service rotations, weekly conferences, effect on research, and resident wellness initiatives). Comparison was made by United States and Puerto Rico regions divided by Northeast, South, Midwest, and West, as these closely correlated with the differences in areas of COVID-19 spread and saturation. REDCap was used as the platform for data capture. Results: A total of 134 emergency medicine residency programs completed the survey. Northeast (44%), South (26%), Midwest (17%) and West (13%) programs by regions were reviewed. Overall, the majority of programs were in an urban setting (70%), and academic practice comprised 58%, followed by community at 40% (p=NS). The curriculum was a 3-year format for 71% of the programs (p=0.002). Overall half of the programs stated their institution was declared a site of pandemic emergency status by the ACGME, with 70% in Northeast and 39% of the Midwest, followed by the West and South regions (p=0.011). The impact of COVID-19 on off-service rotations for the emergency medicine residencies was not significant;Northeast had a high impact in 34% of the programs, moderate impact for Midwest (35%) and minimal impact in the South (34%) and West (29%) programs. Weekly lectures were switched to virtual format and smaller groups. Of note, clinical research for prospective studies was negatively impacted throughout all the regions (p=0.034), however retrospective studies were not affected. Additionally, 88% of programs reported changes since the start of COVID-19 to assure residents with new initiatives and activities such as improving wellness and reducing burnout and stress. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the training of emergency medicine residents in various aspects. Northeast programs were more affected compared to the other regions. Weekly didactic sessions largely transitioned to a virtual format and/or small group sessions. Off-service rotations overall were not significantly affected. Retrospective clinical research continued while there was a substantial disruption in prospective research projects. Finally, a positive outcome was the increased awareness to changes in improving resident well-being overall.","Waseem, M.; Wang, J.; Shariff, M.; Asad, H.; Josephson, E.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.07.063; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064421006223; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064421006223,478

This was a single-center observational study, recruiting all consecutive adults with COVID-19. The elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to the highest level between COVID-19 diagnosis and hospital discharge was categorized according to a standardized toxicity grade scale. In total, 799 patients were included in this study, 39% of which were female, with a mean age of 69.9 (±16.0) years. Of these patients, 225 (28.1%) developed LEE of grade ≥2 after a median of three days (interquartile range (IQR): 0–8 days) from the diagnosis of COVID-19, and they were estimated to have a higher hazard of death or ICU admission (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14–1.88). The clinical and laboratory variables associated with the development of LEE were male sex, higher respiratory rate, higher gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and lower albumin levels at baseline. Among the analyzed treatments, steroids, tocilizumab and darunavir/ritonavir correlated with LEE. In conclusion, LEE were associated with mortality and ICU admission among COVID-19 patients.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Are people with asthma at a higher risk of being infected, hospitalised or of poorer clinical outcomes from COVID-19? METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis based on five main databases including the WHO COVID-19 database between December 1, 2019 to July 11, 2021 on studies with a control (non-asthma) group was conducted. Prevalence and risk ratios were pooled using Sidik-Jonkman random effects meta-analyses. FINDINGS: Fifty-one studies with an 8.08% (95% CI 6.87–9.30) pooled prevalence of people with asthma among COVID-19 positive cases. The risk ratios were 0.83 (95% CI 0.73–0.95, p=0.01) for acquiring COVID-19; 1.18 (95% CI 0.98–1.42, p=0.08) for hospitalisation; 1.21 (95% CI 0.97–1.51, p=0.09) for ICU admission; 1.06 (95% CI 0.82–1.36, p=0.65) for ventilator use and 0.94 (95% CI 0.76–1.17; p=0.58) for mortality for people with asthma. Subgroup analyses by continent revealed a significant difference in risk of acquiring COVID-19, ICU admission, ventilator use and death between the continents. INTERPRETATION: The risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 was reduced compared to the non-asthma group. No statistically significant differences in hospitalisation, ICU admission and ventilator use were found between groups. Subgroup analyses showed significant differences in outcomes from COVID-19 between America, Europe and Asia.

Existing prognostic models mostly consider the impact of biomarkers at presentation on the risk of a single patient outcome at a single follow up time. We collected data for 553 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital whose eventual outcomes were known. The data collected for the patients included demographics, comorbidities and laboratory values taken at admission and throughout the course of hospitalization. We trained multivariate Markov prognostic models to identify high-risk patients at admission along with a dynamic measure of risk incorporating time-dependent changes in patients’ laboratory values. From the set of factors available upon admission, the Markov model determined that age >80 years, history of coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased mortality risk. The lab values upon admission most associated with mortality included neutrophil percentage, red blood cells (RBC), red cell distribution width (RDW), protein levels, platelets count, albumin levels and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Incorporating dynamic changes in lab values throughout hospitalization lead to dramatic gains in the predictive accuracy of the model and indicated a catalogue of variables for determining high-risk patients including eosinophil percentage, white blood cells (WBC), platelets, pCO2, RDW, large unstained cells (LUC) count, alkaline phosphatase and albumin. Our prognostic model highlights the nuance of determining risk for COVID-19 patients and indicates that, rather than a single variable, a range of factors (at different points in hospitalization) are needed for effective risk stratification.","Momeni-Boroujeni, Amir; Mendoza, Rachelle; Stopard, Isaac J.; Lambert, Ben; Zuretti, Alejandro",Infect Dis Rep,https://doi.org/10.3390/idr13010027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33803753/,478
677087,COVID-19 Outcomes in Patients Undergoing B Cell Depletion Therapy and Those with Humoral Immunodeficiency States: A Scoping Review,2021-05-14,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caught the globe unprepared without targeted medical countermeasures, such as therapeutics, to target the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, in recent months multiple monoclonal antibody therapeutics to treat COVID-19 have been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Despite these authorizations and promising clinical trial efficacy results, monoclonal antibody therapies are currently underutilized as a treatment for COVID-19 across the U.S. Many barriers exist when deploying a new infused therapeutic during an ongoing pandemic with limited resources and staffing, and it is critical to better understand the process and site requirements of incorporating monoclonal antibody infusions into pandemic response activities. Methods: We examined the monoclonal antibody infusion site process components, resources, and requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic using data from three initial infusion sites at medical centers in the U.S. supported by the National Disaster Medical System. A descriptive analysis was conducted using process assessment metrics to inform recommendations to strengthen monoclonal antibody infusion site implementation. Results: The monoclonal antibody infusion sites varied in physical environment and staffing models due to state polices, infection control mechanisms, and underlying medical system structure, but exhibited a common process workflow. Sites operationalized an infusion process staffing model with at least two nurses per ten infusion patients. Monoclonal antibody implementation success factors included tailoring the infusion process to the patient community, strong engagement with local medical providers, batch preparing the therapy before patient arrival, placing the infusion center in proximity to emergency services, and creating procedures resilient to EUA changes. Infusion process challenges stemmed from confirming patient SARS-CoV-2 positivity, strained staff, scheduling needs, and coordination with the pharmacy for therapy preparation. Conclusions: Infusion site processes are most effective when integrated into the pre-existing pandemic response ecosystems and can be implemented with limited staff and physical resources. As the pandemic and policy tools such as EUAs evolve, monoclonal antibody infusion processes must also remain adaptable, as practice changes directly affect resources, staffing, timing, and workflows. Future use may be aided by incorporating innovative emergency deployment techniques, such as vehicle and home-based therapy administration, and by developing drug delivery mechanisms that alleviate the need for observed intravenous infusions by medically-accredited staff.","Lambrou, A.

However, there is a lack of an objective method to measure actual hours of brace usage. The aim was to develop a functional prototype of a SMART (Sensor-integrated for Monitoring And Remote Tracking) clubfoot brace to record accurate brace usage and transmit the data remotely to healthcare providers treating clubfoot. METHODS: A collaborative team of engineers and doctors was formed to investigate various types of sensors and wireless technologies to develop a functional prototype of a SMART brace. RESULTS: Infrared sensors were used to detect if the feet were placed inside the shoes and magnetic Hall effect sensors to detect that the shoes were latched on to the bar of the existing FAB. Brace usage data were captured by the sensors every 15 minutes and stored locally on a data card. A Bluetooth low energy (BLE)-based wireless transmission system was used to send the data daily from the brace to the remote cloud server via a smartphone application. Accurate brace usage data could be recorded by the sensors and visualized in real time on a web-based application in a pre-clinical setting, demonstrating feasibility in clinical practice. CONCLUSION: The low-cost SMART brace prototype that we have developed can accurately measure and remotely transmit brace usage data and has the potential to transform caregivers’ behaviour towards brace adherence, which could result in a tangible reduction in recurrence rates.","Aroojis, Alaric; Pandey, Tapas; Dusa, Ajay; Krishnan, Arun G.; Ghyar, Rupesh; Ravi, Bhallamudi",Int Orthop,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-021-05042-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33885922/,478

We sample and analyze the Weibo posts from 17,865 active Weibo users using the approach of Online Ecological Recognition (OER) based on several machine-learning predictive models. We calculated word frequency, scores of emotional indicators (e.g., anxiety, depression, indignation, and Oxford happiness) and cognitive indicators (e.g., social risk judgment and life satisfaction) from the collected data. The sentiment analysis and the paired sample t-test were performed to examine the differences in the same group before and after the declaration of COVID-19 on 20 January, 2020. The results showed that negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, depression and indignation) and sensitivity to social risks increased, while the scores of positive emotions (e.g., Oxford happiness) and life satisfaction decreased. People were concerned more about their health and family, while less about leisure and friends.

This study aims to illuminate social determinants of health and to identify challenges and opportunities in addressing social determinants of child health (SDCH) in rural Cambodia. METHODS: This is a qualitative study based on interviews of frontline primary health care providers, health officials, local authorities and community volunteers in two health districts in Cambodia. The data were supplemented by secondary data on different aspects of the districts and Cambodia. RESULTS: Poverty, lack of basic commodities and adverse social conditions remained problems for population health. While access to health services was considered adequate, households and communities had several major risk exposures. Challenges in addressing SDCH were the high prevalence of social and household adverse conditions, and the lack of training of providers, of information about social services, of effective coordination and of trust in public services. Opportunities were present, including social services being existent albeit poor functioning, the traditional practice of social inquiry, existing frontline providers being open to further information and training, existing subnational coordination bodies at district and provincial levels, and use of evidence in planning and resource allocation. CONCLUSION: Addressing SDCH requires broad and coordinated efforts of stakeholders from multiple sectors. Among the prerequisites are to leverage the existing structures and mechanisms, training primary health care providers and providing them with adequate information about local resources and available supports. Improving social care services and infrastructures requires strong coordination, planning and adequate resource allocation.","Khim, Keovathanak; Andermann, Anne",Can J Public Health,https://doi.org/10.17269/s41997-020-00442-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33471345/,478

METHODS: After obtaining permission from the ICIQ group to translate the ICIQ bladder diary into Persian, we translated, back-translated it, and developed a Persian ICIQ bladder diary. Then, we evaluated its reliability and validity virtually via social media owing to some limitations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We calculated the content validity index (CVI) and content validity ratio (CVR) quantitatively. RESULTS: Thirty-nine participants completed the final version of the ICIQ bladder diary. Most of the participants were female (76.3%). For face validity, we interviewed 10 participants. Most of them considered it easy to complete the bladder diary, using a 500-ml measuring cup. Ten experts’ panel determined the CVI, and the CVR. All ICIQ bladder diary criteria gained a high score, and all experts believed that all criteria of the diary were essential for patient evaluation (CVI: 0.89 to 1). Cronbach’s alpha coefficient in all diary parameters was greater than 0.80 indicating high internal consistency. The test–retest reliability by intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) for each diary parameters showed a high score indicating good agreement between the first and second test diaries. CONCLUSION: The Persian ICIQ bladder diary demonstrates good stability and strong content validity among the Iranian population with lower urinary tract symptoms.","Tayebi, Sona; Salehi-Pourmehr, Hanieh; Hajebrahimi, Sakineh; Hashim, Hashim",Int Urogynecol J,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-021-04908-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34251472/,478

679606,"COVID-19, radiotherapy and cancer",2020-04-20,"Background: Globally rural medicine is currently suffering from staff shortages. Social and professional isolation are identified as significant pressures on health professionals working in rural areas. Social media (SOME) has created new methods of social engagement where conventional forms have failed. The Rural Family Medicine Café (RFMC) is a SOME project created to engage and support those interested in rural family medicine thus decreasing occupational isolation. Methods: A quantitative analysis of SOME activity associated with the RFMC was done by measuring the frequency of #ruralcafe, #ruralwomenGP, #ruralGP, #ruralstories, and #ruralmedicine from October 2015 to October 2016 along with the number of Facebook page likes and YouTube views. A time series and regression analysis were done to assess the correlation between the frequencies of hashtag use and the number of new likes or views. A qualitative analysis of the content of tweets using the associated hashtags and comments on the RFMC YouTube videos was then done to assess participants' response to the RFMC. To add context to the data collected, regularly attending participants were invited for a semi-structured interview. Results: There was a positive trend in the number of Facebook page likes (+273%) and Twitter hashtag use (+2,458%) but a negative trend (−92%) in the number of RFMC YouTube views. There was no statistically significant relationship between the number of views on the RFMC YouTube and RFMC associated SOME activity (p = 0.141). A significant relationship was shown between the number of Facebook page likes and the number of views on the RFMC YouTube (p = 0.037). Participants felt positively about the RFMC with recurring themes of; promotion, advocacy, public health, engagement, inspire, sharing, spreading information, feeling connected and general positive comments such as “enjoying tweets,” “great discussion.” Participants shared anecdotes, useful links, and book recommendations. Conclusion: The RFMC has seen an increase in the amount of associated SOME activity despite having less viewers. This is most likely due to the few participants of the RFMC continuing the café discussions on SOME, particularly Twitter, and engaging outside of the RFMC. The RFMC has developed into a virtual community which is reducing occupational isolation for its participants.","Wheatley, Amber; Floss, Mayara; Bakola, Maria; Kampouraki, Maria; Silveira, Bianca; Scott-Jones, Jo",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330339/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.595255,478
680033,Cutaneous Manifestations of COVID-19: An Evidence-Based Review,2020-08-31,"INTRODUCTION: With the spread of COVID-19 epidemic, health plans must be adapted continuously. There is an urgent need to define the best care courses of patients with COVID-19, especially in intensive care units (ICUs), according to their individualised benefit/risk ratio. Since older age is associated with poorer short-term and long-term outcomes, prediction models are needed, that may assist clinicians in their ICU admission decision. Senior-COVID-Rea was designed to evaluate, in patients over 60 years old admitted in ICU for severe COVID-19 disease, the impact of age and geriatric and paraclinical parameters on their mortality 30 days after ICU admission. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre survey protocol to be conducted in seven hospitals of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, France. All patients over 60 years old admitted in ICU for severe COVID-19 infection (or their legally acceptable representative) will be proposed to enter the study and to fill in a questionnaire regarding their functional and nutritional parameters 1 month before COVID-19 infection. Paraclinical parameters at ICU admission will be collected: lymphocytes and neutrophils counts, high-fluorescent lymphoid cells and immature granulocytes percentages (Sysmex data), D-dimers, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine, CT scan for lung extension rate as well as clinical resuscitation scores, and the delay between the first signs of infection and ICU admission. The primary outcome will be the overall survival at day 30 post-ICU admission. The analysis of factors predicting mortality at day 30 will be carried out using univariate and multivariate logistic regressions. Multivariate logistic regression will consider up to 15 factors. The ambition of this trial, which takes into account the different approaches of geriatric vulnerability, is to define the respective abilities of different operational criteria of frailty to predict patients’ outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was ethically approved. The results of the primary and secondary objectives will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

Author's reply",2021,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be curtailed by vaccination. We assessed the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a viral vectored coronavirus vaccine that expresses the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We did a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial in five trial sites in the UK of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared with a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) as control. Healthy adults aged 18–55 years with no history of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or of COVID-19-like symptoms were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at a dose of 5 × 10(10) viral particles or MenACWY as a single intramuscular injection. A protocol amendment in two of the five sites allowed prophylactic paracetamol to be administered before vaccination. Ten participants assigned to a non-randomised, unblinded ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group received a two-dose schedule, with the booster vaccine administered 28 days after the first dose. Humoral responses at baseline and following vaccination were assessed using a standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a muliplexed immunoassay, three live SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays (a 50% plaque reduction neutralisation assay [PRNT(50)]; a microneutralisation assay [MNA(50), MNA(80), and MNA(90)]; and Marburg VN), and a pseudovirus neutralisation assay. Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The co-primary outcomes are to assess efficacy, as measured by cases of symptomatic virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were done by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Safety was assessed over 28 days after vaccination. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. The study is ongoing, and was registered at ISRCTN, 15281137, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606. FINDINGS: Between April 23 and May 21, 2020, 1077 participants were enrolled and assigned to receive either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=543) or MenACWY (n=534), ten of whom were enrolled in the non-randomised ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group. Local and systemic reactions were more common in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and many were reduced by use of prophylactic paracetamol, including pain, feeling feverish, chills, muscle ache, headache, and malaise (all p<0·05). There were no serious adverse events related to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. In the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, spike-specific T-cell responses peaked on day 14 (median 856 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IQR 493–1802; n=43). Anti-spike IgG responses rose by day 28 (median 157 ELISA units [EU], 96–317; n=127), and were boosted following a second dose (639 EU, 360–792; n=10). Neutralising antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 32 (91%) of 35 participants after a single dose when measured in MNA(80) and in 35 (100%) participants when measured in PRNT(50). After a booster dose, all participants had neutralising activity (nine of nine in MNA(80) at day 42 and ten of ten in Marburg VN on day 56). Neutralising antibody responses correlated strongly with antibody levels measured by ELISA (R(2)=0·67 by Marburg VN; p<0·001). INTERPRETATION: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed an acceptable safety profile, and homologous boosting increased antibody responses. These results, together with the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses, support large-scale evaluation of this candidate vaccine in an ongoing phase 3 programme.

680464,COVID-19 Causing Hypotension in Frail Geriatric Hypertensive Patients?,2021-06-18,"Intestinal lymphatic transport has been shown to be an absorptive pathway following oral administration of lipids and an increasing number of lipophilic drugs, which once absorbed, diffuse across the intestinal enterocyte and while in transit associate with secretable enterocyte lipoproteins. The chylomicron-associated drug is then secreted from the enterocyte into the lymphatic circulation, rather than the portal circulation, thus avoiding the metabolically-active liver, but still ultimately returning to the systemic circulation. Because of this parallel and potentially alternative absorptive pathway, first-pass metabolism can be reduced while increasing lymphatic drug exposure, which opens the potential for novel therapeutic modalities and allows the implementation of lipid-based drug delivery systems. This review discusses the physiological features of the lymphatics, enterocyte uptake and metabolism, links between drug transport and lipid digestion/re-acylation, experimental model (in vivo, in vitro, and in silico) of lymphatic transport, and the design of lipid- or prodrug-based drug delivery systems for enhancing lymphatic drug transport.","Yáñez, Jaime A.; Wang, Stephen W.J.; Knemeyer, Ian W.; Wirth, Mark A.; Alton, Kevin B.",Adv Drug Deliv Rev,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169409X11001414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21689702/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2011.05.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169409X11001414,478

PURPOSE: To ascertain the role of semi-quantitative scoring in visual-coronary artery calcification score (V-CACS) for predicting the clinical severity and outcome in patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With institutional review board approval this study included 67 COVID-19 confirmed patients who underwent non-cardiac gated CT chest in an inpatient setting. Two blinded radiologist (Radiologist-1 &2) assessed the V-CACS, CT Chest severity score (CT-SS). The clinical data including the requirement for oxygen support, assisted ventilation, ICU admission and outcome was assessed, and patients were clinically subdivided depending on clinical severity. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors. ROC curves analysis is performed for the assessment of performance and Pearson correlation were performed to looks for the associations. RESULTS: V-CACS cut off value of 3 (82.67% sensitivity and 54.55% specificity; AUC 0.75) and CT-SS with a cut off value of 21.5 (95.7% sensitivity and 63.6% specificity; AUC 0.87) are independent predictors for clinical severity and also the need for ICU admission or assisted ventilation. The pooling of both CT-SS and V-CACS (82.67% sensitivity and 86.4% specificity; AUC 0.92) are more reliable in terms of predicting the primary outcome of COVID-19 patients. On regression analysis, V-CACS and CT-SS are individual independent predictors of clinical severity in COVID-19 (Odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.99–2.98; p = 0.05 and Odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08–1.39; p = 0.001 respectively). The area under the curve (AUC) for pooled V-CACS and CT-SS was 0.96 (95% CI 0.84–0.98) which correctly predicted 82.1% cases. CONCLUSION: Logistic regression model using pooled Visual-Coronary artery calcification score and CT Chest severity score in non-cardiac gated CT can predict clinical severity and outcome in patients with COVID-19.","Nair, Anirudh Venugopalan; Kumar, Devendra; Yadav, Santosh Kumar; Nepal, Pankaj; Jacob, Bamil; Al-Heidous, Mahmoud",Clin Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinimag.2021.01.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33485116/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899707121000188; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899707121000188,478

The computer-assisted web interviewing (CAWI) technique was used to collect data from 1033 Polish adults in March 2020. Logistic regression was used to estimate the likelihood of fear of limited access to food and the likelihood of purchase of larger amounts of food than usual. The likelihood of experiencing fear of limited access to food increased by 16% with higher perceived stress, by 50% with higher trust in “Mass media and friends”, and by 219% with perceived changes in food availability in the previous month. Trust in “Polish government institutions” decreased the chance of experiencing such fears by 22%. The likelihood of purchasing larger quantities of food than usual increased by 9% with higher perceived stress, by 46% with higher trust in “Mass media and friends”, by 81% with perceived changes in food availability in the last month, and by 130% with fears of limited access to food as the pandemic spreads. Government institutions may have difficulty in disseminating pandemic-related recommendations through media, not only due to relatively low trust people have in media organizations but also due to the increasing likelihood of the occurrence of both fears regarding food availability and panic-stricken food-buying behaviors with increase in trust in this source of information. Therefore, it is necessary to develop interventions that will reduce perceived stress and improve the trust in information from reputable sources.","Jeżewska-Zychowicz, Marzena; Plichta, Marta; Królak, Maria",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32957585/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12092852,478

Federal, state, and local public health responders must be able to plan for and respond to these events at aviation points of entry. The emergence of a novel influenza virus and its spread to the United States were simulated for February 2009 from 55 international metropolitan areas using three basic reproduction numbers (R(0)): 1.53, 1.70, and 1.90. Empirical data from the pH1N1 virus were used to validate our SEIR model. Time to entry to the U.S. during the early stages of a prototypical novel communicable disease was predicted based on the aviation network patterns and the epidemiology of the disease. For example, approximately 96% of origins (R(0) of 1.53) propagated a disease into the U.S. in under 75 days, 90% of these origins propagated a disease in under 50 days. An R(0) of 1.53 reproduced the pH1NI observations. The ability to anticipate the rate and location of disease introduction into the U.S. provides greater opportunity to plan responses based on the scenario as it is unfolding.

This work evaluated the psychological impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Spanish frontline healthcare workers of two tertiary hospitals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Healthcare workers were recruited from the medical units designated for the care of Covid-19 patients. The psychological assessment consisted of an individual, face-to-face session where gold-standard psychometric tests were administered to assess stress (VASS & PSS-10), anxiety (STAI), depression (PHQ-2) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PCL-5). Regression models were also fitted to identify predictors of psychological distress. RESULTS: Overall, almost 13% of healthcare workers showed severe anxiety, while more than 26% had high levels of perceived stress. More than 23% presented severe posttraumatic stress symptoms, and another 13% had PHQ-2 scores equal to or above 3, compatible with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) diagnosis, respectively. Women, stress-related medication, overworking, performing in Covid-19 wards, and substance abuse were risk factors for increased psychological distress. Instead, practising exercise reduced the burden. CONCLUSION: This study outlines the severe psychological impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Spanish frontline healthcare workers. The stress, depression and anxiety levels found were similar to those reported in similar works but much higher than in Wuhan healthcare workers. Knowledge of risk factors for increased psychological distress may help to develop comprehensive intervention strategies to prevent, control and reduce the mental health exacerbation of healthcare workers, thereby maintaining the effectiveness of health systems in critical scenarios.","Sangrà, Pau Sobregrau; Mir, Sira Aguiló; Ribeiro, Thaís Castro; Esteban-Sepúlveda, Silvia; Page, Esther Garcia; Barbeito, Beatriz López; Moya-Prats, José Luís Pomar; Pérez, Luís Pintor; Llobet, Jordi Aguiló",Compr Psychiatry,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010440X21000560; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X21000560?v=s5,478
683191,Clinical Differences between COVID-19 and a COVID-Like Syndrome,2021-06-07,"Background Prisons and jails are high-risk settings for COVID-19 transmission, morbidity, and mortality. COVID-19 vaccines may substantially reduce these risks, but evidence is needed of their effectiveness for incarcerated people, who are confined in large, risky congregate settings. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study to estimate effectiveness of mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), against confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among incarcerated people in California prisons from December 22, 2020 through March 1, 2021. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation provided daily data for all prison residents including demographic, clinical, and carceral characteristics, as well as COVID-19 testing, vaccination status, and outcomes. We estimated vaccine effectiveness using multivariable Cox models with time-varying covariates that adjusted for resident characteristics and infection rates across prisons. Findings Among 60,707 residents in the cohort, 49% received at least one BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 dose during the study period. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was 74% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64-82%) from day 14 after first dose until receipt of second dose and 97% (95% CI, 88-99%) from day 14 after second dose. Effectiveness was similar among the subset of residents who were medically vulnerable (74% [95% CI, 62-82%] and 92% [95% CI, 74-98%] from 14 days after first and second doses, respectively), as well as among the subset of residents who received the mRNA-1273 vaccine (71% [95% CI, 58-80%] and 96% [95% CI, 67-99%]). Conclusions Consistent with results from randomized trials and observational studies in other populations, mRNA vaccines were highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections among incarcerated people. Prioritizing incarcerated people for vaccination, redoubling efforts to boost vaccination and continuing other ongoing mitigation practices are essential in preventing COVID-19 in this disproportionately affected population.","Chin, E.

683546,"Characteristics, Management, and Case-Fatality of Patients Hospitalized for Stroke with a Diagnosis of COVID-19 in France",2021-06-24,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the spine surgeon had to deal with some new challenges in treating emergency spine cases. This paper aimed to report our experience with spine emergency surgery during the pandemic, with already limited resources for surgery. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center study, involving all patients admitted to our hospital during a period of 1st March – 31(st) December 2020 and underwent emergent spinal surgery. The data were collected from the patients’ medical records. RESULTS: We found 15 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Four patients were suspected to be infected by COVID-19, but none of them was confirmed to be infected by COVID-19 based on the PCR test. All patients had a history of injury: fell from height (53.3%), traffic accident (40%), and direct trauma (6.7%). The average time interval from injury to hospital admission was 38.6 h, from admission to surgery was 6.3 days, and from injury to surgery was 8.1 days. The patient who was suspected to be infected with COVID-19 has a significantly greater time interval from admission to surgery (p = 0.012). The surgery lasted for 3–6 h, with an average of 4.6 h. The average hospital stay duration was 13.3 days and it has a significant positive correlation with the time interval from admission to surgery (p = 0.001). Three months post-operatively, seven patients experienced an improvement in the Frankel grade, 4 patients had no changes in Frankel grade, and 2 patients died. CONCLUSION: To our experience, the lack of human and material resources during the pandemic caused some delay in surgery. However, surgery performed later than 24 h during the pandemic might still bring benefit to the patient.","Sakti, Yudha Mathan; Khadafi, Rosyad Nur",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34183902/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102513; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080121004635; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080121004635?v=s5,478

Launched in 2004, the Step 2 CS examination was intended to ensure that physicians entering graduate medical education possess the necessary information gathering, clinical reasoning, and communication skills necessary to provide patient care. Although the requirement that doctors pass a clinical skills examination as a condition of licensure likely improved some elements of medical education and physician practice, the Step 2 CS examination was deeply unpopular among many medical students since its inception. The demise of USMLE Step 2 CS provides an opportunity to re-examine the test’s value and incorporate improvements in future iterations. However, doing so requires a clear understanding of why the test was so vigorously challenged. Here, we review the history of clinical skills examinations used for medical licensure in the United States and highlight the persistent concerns regarding Step 2 CS’s cost, value, validity, and lack of examinee feedback before proposing future improvements to address each concern.","Tsichlis, Jason T; Del Re, Andrew M; Carmody, J.

Firstly, the Attitudes towards gambling scale (ATGS-8) was used to discover respondents’ attitudes to gambling. Secondly, their experience with gambling was examined with the help of the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) which allowed, among others, to estimate the level of prevalence of problem gambling in these groups. The methods used allowed us to compare both the Ukrainians to Vietnamese as well as Ukrainians and Vietnamese to Czechs, as similar survey was conducted among the major population of the country in 2017. The overall score of attitudes to gambling is slightly higher for the citizens of Ukraine (17.97) and Vietnam (18.29) compared to the majority. The Vietnamese living in the Czech Republic also have a significantly higher proportion of people in the category of pathological gamblers as based on the PGSI index (Vietnamese 4.2%), whilst the value of this index for Ukrainians (0.7%) is similar to the one of the majority. The analysis of immigrants’ gambling behaviour shows that Ukrainians are more like the majority population. The Vietnamese immigrants differ from both the majority population and Ukrainians in terms of attitudes whilst gambling is for them as common problem as alcohol consumption, and an even bigger problem than smoking.","Fiedor, David; Seidlová, Markéta",J Gambl Stud,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10899-021-10049-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191205/,478
683938,Potential value of heparin in COVID-19 related cardiovascular disease,2021-10-02,"We examined scapula glenoids (n = 14) and proximal articular humeri (n = 14) of seven gray wolves that were maintained in a sanctuary park setting. Immediately after death, observations were made visually in situ and by radiography. Further observations were made in a museum laboratory setting, prior to and following clearing of soft tissues. Selected dry bone specimens were evaluated using computed tomography. Significant cartilage erosion and osteoarthropathy were identified in all shoulder joints. No single evaluation method yielded maximal information. Plain film radiography revealed only more severe changes. Computed tomography yielded more detail and clarity than standard radiography. Direct examination of articular cartilage informed about joint soft tissue, and dry bone informed about externally visible bone pathology. These data provide a basis for biological, biomedical, ecological, and archaeological scientists to improve retrospective interpretations of bone lesions. They further support developing plausible differential diagnoses for features of ancient and modern animal bones. We noted a dog‐like capacity for wolf longevity in a non‐free‐roaming environment. However, aged wolves' life spans far exceeded those of similar‐sized domestic dogs and breeds, suggesting the possibility of an important species difference that should be explored. We suggest also a hypothesis that the driving force for joint pathology in sheltered non‐domestic species may relate significantly to achieving the longevity that is possible biologically, but is uncommon in the wild because of differential stochastic influences.

The combination of humoral and cellular immunity will most likely contribute to protection from reinfection or severe disease. Methods Here, we conducted a longitudinal study on hospitalized moderate and severe COVID-19 patients from the acute phase of disease into convalescence at five- and nine-months post symptom onset. Utilizing flow cytometry, serological assays as well as B cell and T cell FluoroSpot assays, we assessed the magnitude and specificity of humoral and cellular immune memory during and after human SARS-CoV-2 infection. Findings During acute COVID-19, we observed an increase in germinal center activity, a substantial expansion of antibodysecreting cells, and the generation of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies. Despite gradually decreasing antibody levels, we show persistent, neutralizing antibody titers as well as robust specific memory B cell responses and polyfunctional T cell responses at five- and nine-months after symptom onset in both moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. Long-term SARS-CoV-2 specific responses were marked by preferential targeting of spike over nucleocapsid protein. Conclusions Our findings describe the initiation and, importantly, persistence of cellular and humoral SARS-CoV-2 specific immunological memory in hospitalized COVID-19 patients long after recovery, likely contributing towards protection against reinfection.","Sandberg, John Tyler; Varnaitė, Renata; Christ, Wanda; Chen, Puran; Muvva, Jagadeeswara R.; Maleki, Kimia T.; García, Marina; Dzidic, Majda; Folkesson, Elin; Skagerberg, Magdalena; Ahlén, Gustaf; Frelin, Lars; Sällberg, Matti; Eriksson, Lars I.; Rooyackers, Olav; Sönnerborg, Anders; Buggert, Marcus; Björkström, Niklas K.; Aleman, Soo; Strålin, Kristoffer; Klingström, Jonas; Ljunggren, Hans-Gustaf; Blom, Kim; Gredmark-Russ, Sara",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.17.435581,478
684468,Management of COVID‐19 infection in organic acidemias,2021-03-08,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide, and it was officially declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Most countries over the entire globe have reported some COVID-19 cases. The current study aimed to assess student knowledge about COVID-19 at different Jordanian universities and determine where they sourced their information. Methods:A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2,083 undergraduate or postgraduate students from different governmental and private universities during the initial stage of the disease in Jordan (March 19–21, 2020) using a validated, structured, self-administered, online questionnaire. The survey was structured to assess their knowledge about viral sources, incubation period, mortality rate, transmission, symptoms and complications as well as the source of information about COVID-19. Results:Overall, 56.5% of the respondents showed good knowledge and almost 40.5% showed moderate knowledge. On the other hand, 3.0% of the participants showed poor knowledge about COVID-19. The average knowledge score of students was 80.1%, which is considered to be within the scale of good knowledge. Both the college of study and educational level significantly (P < 0.05) associated with student knowledge. Students who majored in medical sciences showed the highest mean score of 82.8%, with 69.0% displaying a good knowledge level. Postgraduate students had significantly higher knowledge scores compared to undergraduate students. The majority of students used the internet, social media and mass media as sources of information about COVID-19. Scientific websites and articles were used more commonly by medical and postgraduate students. Conclusions:The COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge to the health of the world population; therefore, these results assessing students' knowledge provide an important baseline for planning required educational interventions such as contact tracing and self-quarantine. These results may also help public health authorities by engaging communities in implementation of protective health measures, including positive hygienic practices such as hand washing to reduce the risk of COVID-19.","Olaimat, Amin N.; Aolymat, Iman; Shahbaz, Hafiz M.; Holley, Richard A.",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32574314/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00254,478

We aimed to identify potential early prognostic protein markers and to expand understanding of proteome dynamics during clinical progression of the disease. We performed in‐depth proteome profiling on 137 sera, longitudinally collected from 25 patients with COVID‐19 (non‐severe patients, n = 13; patients who progressed to severe COVID‐19, n = 12). We identified 11 potential biomarkers, including the novel markers IGLV3‐19 and BNC2, as early potential prognostic indicators of severe COVID‐19. These potential biomarkers are mainly involved in biological processes associated with humoral immune response, interferon signalling, acute phase response, lipid metabolism, and platelet degranulation. We further revealed that the longitudinal changes of 40 proteins persistently increased or decreased as the disease progressed to severe COVID‐19. These 40 potential biomarkers could effectively reflect the clinical progression of the disease. Our findings provide some new insights into host response to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which are valuable for understanding of COVID‐19 disease progression. This study also identified potential biomarkers that could be further validated, which may support better predicting and monitoring progression to severe COVID‐19.","Lee, Jee‐Soo; Han, Dohyun; Kim, So Yeon; Hong, Ki Ho; Jang, Myoung‐jin; Kim, Man Jin; Kim, Young‐gon; Park, Jae Hyeon; Cho, Sung Im; Park, Wan Beom; Lee, Kyung Bok; Shin, Ho Seob; Oh, Hyeon Sae; Kim, Taek Soo; Park, Sung Sup; Seong, Moon‐Woo",Proteomics,https://doi.org/10.1002/pmic.202000278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33945677/,478

As the incidence continues to rise at a rapid pace, critical care teams are faced with challenging treatment decisions. There is currently no widely accepted standard of care in the pharmacologic management of patients with COVID‐19. Urgent identification of potential treatment strategies is a priority. Therapies include novel agents available in clinical trials or through compassionate use, and other drugs, repurposed antiviral and immunomodulating therapies. Many have demonstrated in vitro or in vivo potential against other viruses that are similar to SARS‐CoV‐2. Critically ill patients with COVID‐19 have additional considerations related to adjustments for organ impairment and renal replacement therapies, complex lists of concurrent medications, limitations with drug administration and compatibility, and unique toxicities that should be evaluated when utilizing these therapies.

De nombreux tests sérologiques aux performances très variables sont proposés. Il est nécessaire et urgent d’en réaliser la validation qualitative afin de ne pas mésestimer la séroprévalence COVID-19. Nous proposons l’évaluation des performances du test de diagnostic rapide (TDR) Orient Gene (OG) COVID-19 IgG/IgM en comparaison au test ELISA-Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay (ASIA). Matériels et méthodes Il s’agit d’un test immuno-chromatographique à flux latéral permettant l’obtention d’un résultat en 10minutes. Un total de 102 sérums provenant de patients ayant eu une RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive ont été testé. Ces patients étaient asymptomatiques (n =2), présentaient des symptômes légers (n =37), des symptômes sévères nécessitant l’hospitalisation (n =35) ou ont dû être admis en réanimation (n =28). La spécificité a été évaluée à partir de 42 sérums provenant de patients présentant diverses pathologies virales (dont des coronavirus endémique), parasitaires ou avec un taux de facteur rhumatoïde élevé et prélevé en période pré-pandémique. Résultats La sensibilité de l’OG était de 95,8 % (IC95 %: 89,6–98,8) pour les échantillons collectés ≥10jours après le début des symptômes ce qui était équivalent à la sensibilité 90,5 % (IC95 %: 82,8–95,6) de l’ASIA. L’OG a permis de détecter 6 sérums négatifs en ASIA parmi lesquels 2 présentaient uniquement des IgM sur l’OG. Parmi les 7 sérums négatifs en l’OG, 3 avaient été prélevés moins de 10jours avant le début des symptômes et les 4 autres sérums provenaient de patients présentant des déficits immunitaires acquis pouvant expliquer la négativité du test malgré une PCR positive antérieure. La spécificité était de 100 % (IC95 %: 93,4–100) avec les deux tests. Conclusion Les caractéristiques de l’OG indique que ce TDR est approprié à une utilisation en routine au laboratoire avec une sensibilité équivalente à un test ELISA classique. Ce test s’adapte également à une utilisation ambulatoire en raison de sa facilité d’utilisation. L’évaluation de ce test sur un plus grand nombre de personnes asymptomatiques peut être nécessaire afin de confirmer nos résultats dans cette population.","Dellière, S.; Salmona, M.; Minier, M.; Gabassi, A.; Alanio, A.; Le Goff, J.; Delaugerre, C.; Chaix, M.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X20303085; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X20303085,478

To gain insight into the pathophysiology of CAPA we performed a case-control study, in which we compared Aspergillus test profiles in CAPA patients and controls in relation to ICU-mortality. Methods A multinational case-control study, in which Aspergillus test results, use of antifungal therapy and mortality were collected from critically-ill COVID-19 patients. Patients were classified using the 2020 ECMM/ISHAM consensus case definitions. Results 219 critically-ill COVID-19 cases were analyzed, including one proven, 38 probable, 19 possible CAPA cases, 21 Aspergillus colonized patients, seven patients only positive for serum (1, 3)-ß-D-glucan (BDG), and 133 cases with no evidence of CAPA. Mortality was 53.8% in CAPA patients compared to 24.1% in patients without CAPA (p=0.001). Positive serum galactomannan (GM) and BDG were associated with increased mortality compared to serum biomarker negative CAPA patients (87.5% versus 41.7%, p=0.046; 90.0% versus 42.1%, p=0.029, respectively). For each point increase in GM or ten-point BDG serum concentration, the odds of death increased (GM, OR 10.208, 95%CI 1.621-64.291, p=0.013; BDG, OR 1.247, 95%CI 1.029-1.511, p=0.024). Conclusions CAPA is a complex disease, probably involving a continuum of respiratory colonization, tissue-invasion and angioinvasion. Serum biomarkers are useful for staging CAPA disease progression and, if positive, indicate angioinvasion and a high probability of mortality. There is need for a biomarker that distinguishes between respiratory tract colonization and tissue invasive CAPA disease.","Ergün, Mehmet; Brüggemann, Roger J M; Alanio, Alexandre; Dellière, Sarah; van Arkel, Andreas; Bentvelsen, Robbert G; Rijpstra, Tom; van der Sar-van der Brugge, Simone; Lagrou, Katrien; Janssen, Nico A F; Buil, Jochem B; van Dijk, Karin; Melchers, Willem J G; Reijers, Monique H E; Schouten, Jeroen A; Wauters, Joost; Cordey, Alan; Soni, Shuchita; White, P Lewis; van de Veerdonk, Frank L; Verweij, Paul E",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01229-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34495710/,478

Our results showed that treatment with glycyrrhizin significantly reduced PRRSV proliferation and PRRSV-encoded protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, glycyrrhizin mainly inhibits the penetration stage, and has little effect on the steps of adsorption or release of PRRSV in its life cycle. Furthermore, we were able to exclude a direct inhibitory action of glycyrrhizin on PRRSV particles.

686429,"Post-Acute COVID Syndrome, the Aftermath of Mild to Severe COVID-19 in Brazilian Patients",2021-06-09,"COVID-19 is a disease caused by a coronavirus named as SARS-CoV-2. It has become pandemic due to its contagious nature. Majority of the patients are asymptomatic or having mild flu like symptoms. Few need hospitalisation due to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). Co-morbidity like diabetes, hypertension, renal failure etc. are associated with severe COVID-19 that often causes death. There have been only two published case reports of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) in patients with COVID-19 disease. Cytokine storm is often observed in severe COVID-19 and various cytokines including IL-6 that activates plasma cells are increased in blood in this condition. Here we present a case of severe COVID-19 patient with bioclonal gammopathy. He was known diabetic and hypertensive on treatment. He developed SARI, cytokines storm and septicaemia, treated with antibiotics, enoxaparin, hydroxychloroquine, insulin, anti-hypertensives, put on ventilator, subsequently developed septicaemia, multi-organ failure and died. Two M-bands on serum capillary electrophoresis with presence IgG-κ on both the M-bands indicates a biclonal gammopathy of unknown significance in this patient. We conclude that like MGUS, early stage biclonal gammopathy, although rare, gets manifested with M-bands on plasma protein electrophoresis. It is probably due to high level of IL-6 associated with cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 that stimulate early stage dyscratic plasma cells. Such biclonal gammopathy might be a risk factor for COVID-19 and associated mortality.","Vashistha, Pooja; Gupta, Ajay; Arya, Mona; Kumar Singh, Vijay; Dubey, Abhishek; Chandra Koner, Bidhan",Clin Chim Acta,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898120305234?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898120305234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33159954/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.10.040,478
686499,On the global trends and spread of the COVID-19 outbreak: preliminary assessment of the potential relation between location-specific temperature and UV index,2020-04-24,"Background: The association between current tobacco smoking, the risk of developing COVID-19 and the severity of illness is an important information gap. Methods: UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app provided baseline data including demographics, anthropometrics, smoking status and medical conditions, were asked to log symptoms daily from 24th March 2020 to 23rd April 2020. Participants reporting that they did not feel physically normal were taken through a series of questions, including 14 potential COVID-19 symptoms and any hospital attendance. The main study outcome was the association between current smoking and the development of classic symptoms of COVID-19 during the pandemic defined as fever, new persistent cough and breathlessness. The number of concurrent COVID-19 symptoms was used as a proxy for severity. In addition, association of subcutaneous adipose tissue expression of ACE2, both the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and a potential mediator of disease severity, with smoking status was assessed in a subset of 541 twins from the TwinsUK cohort. Results: Data were available on 2,401,982 participants, mean(SD) age 43.6(15.1) years, 63.3% female, overall smoking prevalence 11.0%. 834,437 (35%) participants reported being unwell and entered one or more symptoms. Current smokers were more likely to develop symptoms suggesting a diagnosis of COVID-19; classic symptoms adjusted OR[95%CI] 1.14[1.10 to 1.18]; >5 symptoms 1.29[1.26 to 1.31]; >10 symptoms 1.50[1.42 to 1.58]. Smoking was associated with reduced ACE2 expression in adipose tissue (Beta(SE)= -0.395(0.149); p=7.01x10-3). Interpretation: These data are consistent with smokers having an increased risk from COVID-19.","Hopkinson, N. S.; Rossi, N.; El-Sayed Moustafa, J.; Laverty, A. A.; Quint, J. K.; Freydin, M.

International respiratory societies defined PR is more than “just an exercise program”; it is a comprehensive care delivered by a team of dedicated healthcare professionals with a strong emphasis on long-term health-enhancing Behaviors. However, “Uncertainty” exists with varied reasons for the political and geographical barriers of referral, uptake, attendance, and completion of PR in both primary and secondary care. Besides, COVID-19 pandemic has sparked many global controversies and challenges on pulmonary rehabilitation service delivery. Post-COVID-19 guidelines emphasize on integrated care rehabilitation for patients with COPD. Thus, this concise review intends to understand the gaps in United Kingdom healthcare policies, practices, and PR services resources. To date, there is no clear consensus on PR integrated care model pathway to address the unmet needs, measure the health and social care disparities; adds to the disease burden of COPD. Based on the culmination of evidence, this perspective offers a theoretical framework of PR integrated service model, a pathway to deliver high-value personalized care to patients with COPD.","Perumal, Shakila Devi",Chronic Dis Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34136770/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cdtm.2021.01.003,478

Design: Two-sample Mendelian randomization study. Setting: Summary data from genome-wide analyses in the population-based UK Biobank and SUNLIGHT Consortium, applied to meta-analyzed results of genome-wide analyses in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Participants: 17,965 COVID-19 cases including 11,085 laboratory or physician confirmed cases, 7,885 hospitalized cases, and 4,336 severe respiratory cases, and 1,370,547 controls, primarily of European ancestry. Exposures: Genetically predicted variation in serum vitamin D status, based on genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with serum vitamin D or risk of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency. Main outcome measures: Susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 infection, including severe respiratory infection and hospitalization. Results: Mendelian randomization analysis, powered to detect moderate effects comparable to those seen in observational studies, provided little to no evidence for an effect of genetically predicted serum vitamin D on susceptibility to or severity of COVID-19 infection. Using SNPs in loci related to vitamin D metabolism as proxies for serum vitamin D concentration, the odds ratio for a standard deviation increase in serum vitamin D was 1.04 (95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.18) for any COVID-19 infection versus population controls, 1.05 (0.84-1.31) for hospitalized COVID-19 versus population controls, 0.96 (0.64 to 1.43) for severe respiratory COVID-19 versus population controls, 1.15 (0.99 to 1.35) for COVID-19 positive versus COVID-19 negative, and 1.44 (0.75 to 2.78) for hospitalized COVID-19 versus non-hospitalized COVID-19. Results were similar in analyses that used all SNPs with genome-wide significant associations with serum vitamin D (i.e., including SNPs in loci with no known relationship to vitamin D metabolism) and in analyses using SNPs with genome-wide significant associations with risk of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. Conclusions: These findings suggest that genetically predicted differences in long-term vitamin D nutritional status do not causally affect susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 infection, and that associations observed in previous studies may have been driven by confounding. These results do not exclude the possibility of low-magnitude causal effects, nor do they preclude potential causal effects of acute responses to therapeutic doses of vitamin D. Future directions include extension of this work to non-European ancestry populations, and high-risk populations, for example persons with comorbid disease.","Patchen, B. K.; Clark, A. G.; Gaddis, N.

688649,Dysphonia in COVID-19 patients: Direct or indirect symptom?,2021-09-20,"The outbreak of CoronaVirus Disease19 (COVID19) in December 2019 posed a serious threat to public safety, and its rapid spread caused a global health emergency. Clinical data show that in addition to respiratory system damage, some male patients with COVID-19 are also accompanied by abnormal renal function and even renal damage. As the main receptor of syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is also found to be highly expressed not only in respiratory mucosa and alveolar epithelial cells, but also in renal tubule cells, testicular Leydig cells and seminiferous tubule cells. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has the possibility of infecting the male reproductive system, and the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the patient's semen further confirms this theory. In previous studies, it has been found that ACE2 has the ability to regulate autophagy. Not only that, recent studies have also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection can also lead to a reduction in autophagy. All of these associate SARS-CoV-2 with autophagy. Furthermore, autophagy has been shown to have an effect on male reproduction in many studies. Based on these, we propose the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 affects male reproductive function by regulating autophagy. This hypothesis may provide a new idea for future treatment of COVID-19 male patients with reproductive function injury, and it can also prompt medical staff and patients to consciously check their reproductive function.","Jun, Sun",Med Hypotheses,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720318910; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720318910?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32679425/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110083,478

In the context of chronic disease, there are many challenges we face in order to provide social well-being to patients and their families, even more if we talk about rare diseases. TransplantChild, a European Reference Network (ERN) in paediatric transplantation, works to improve the quality of life of transplanted children. It is not possible to improve the quality of life if the human and material resources are not available. With this study, we want to identify the economic aids, facilities, services, and financed products that are offered to families in different European centres. We also want to find out who provides these resources and the accessibility to them. We designed an ad hoc survey using the EU Survey software tool. The survey was sent to representatives of the 26 ERN members. In this article we present the results obtained in relation to two of the aspects analysed: long-term financial assistance and drugs, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Some resources are equally available in all participating centres but there are significant differences in others, such as education aids or parapharmacy product financing. A local analysis of these differences is necessary to find feasible solutions for equal opportunities for all transplanted children in Europe. The experience of centres that already provide certain solutions successfully may facilitate the implementation of these solutions in other hospitals.","Pascau, María Jesús; Pruneda, Laura; de Barbieri, Ilaria; Correia, Matilde; López, Belén; Guijarro, Erika; Sofío, Gonzalo; Frauca Remacha, Esteban; Jara Vega, Paloma",Children (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/children8090723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34572155/,478

689159,CLINICAL TRIALS IN COVID-19 MANAGEMENT & PREVENTION: A META-EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY EXAMINING METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY,2020-11-30,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence that food industry actors try to shape science on nutrition and physical activity. But they are also involved in influencing the principles of scientific integrity. Our research objective was to study the extent of that involvement, with a case study of ILSI as a key actor in that space. We conducted a qualitative document analysis, triangulating data from an existing scoping review, publicly available information, internal industry documents, and existing freedom of information requests. RESULTS: Food companies have joined forces through ILSI to shape the development of scientific integrity principles. These activities started in 2007, in direct response to the growing criticism of the food industry’s funding of research. ILSI first built a niche literature on COI in food science and nutrition at the individual and study levels. Because the literature was scarce on that topic, these publications were used and cited in ILSI’s and others’ further work on COI, scientific integrity, and PPP, beyond the fields of nutrition and food science. In the past few years, ILSI started to shape the very principles of scientific integrity then and to propose that government agencies, professional associations, non-for-profits, and others, adopt these principles. In the process, ILSI built a reputation in the scientific integrity space. ILSI’s work on scientific integrity ignores the risks of accepting corporate funding and fails to provide guidelines to protect from these risks. CONCLUSIONS: The activities developed by ILSI on scientific integrity principles are part of a broader set of political practices of industry actors to influence public health policy, research, and practice. It is important to learn about and counter these practices as they risk shaping scientific standards to suit the industry’s interests rather than public health ones.

However, the biological function of this interaction is not completely understood. We analyzed the variability of ∼90 000 sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, particularly, its mutations in disordered regions containing binding motifs for 14-3-3 proteins. We studied how these mutations affect the binding energy to 14-3-3γ and found that changes positively affecting the predicted interaction with 14-3-3γ are the most successfully spread, with the highest prevalence in the phylogenetic tree. Although most residues are highly conserved within the 14-3-3 binding site, compensatory mutations to maintain the interaction energy of N-14-3-3γ were found, including half of the current variants of concern and interest. Our results suggest that binding of N to 14-3-3γ is beneficial for the virus, thus targeting this viral-host protein-protein interaction seems an attractive approach to explore antiviral strategies.","Del Veliz, Samanta; Rivera, Lautaro; Bustos, Diego M.; Uhart, Marina",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.06.100; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X21010238?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X21010238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34246830/,478

690205,Systematic Screening for Venous Thromboembolic Events in COVID-19 Pneumonia,2020-06-08,"INTRODUCTION: : To examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stroke, the number of stroke patients, time since last known well (LKW), morbidity, and mortality of stroke patients in Southwest Healthcare System (SHS), California (CA) and the United States (US) were analyzed during 2019 and compared to 2020. Our hypothesis is that there are regional differences in stroke outcome depending on location during the COVID-19 study period which influences stroke epidemiology and clinical stroke practice. METHODS: : The American Heart Association's ‘Get with the Guidelines’ (GWTG) database was used to evaluate the following categories: code stroke, diagnosis of stroke upon discharge, inpatient mortality, modified Rankin Score (mRS) upon discharge (morbidity), and time since last known well (LKW). Stroke registry data from February through June 2019 and 2020 were collected for retrospective review. RESULTS: : The total number of strokes decreased in the US and CA, but increased in SHS during the COVID-19 study period. The US and SHS demonstrated no change in stroke mortality, but CA demonstrated a higher stroke mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was greater loss of independence with increased stroke morbidity in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a significant increase in time since LKW in the US and SHS, and an increase trend in time since LKW in CA during the COVID-19 study period. DISCUSSION: : To understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stroke epidemiology, we propose that all stroke inpatients should receive a SARS-CoV-2 detection test and this result be entered into the GWTG database. We demonstrate that the regional distribution of stroke mortality in the US changed during the COVID-19 study period, with increased stroke mortality in CA. Stroke morbidity throughout the US was significantly worse during the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose methods to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical stroke practice such as the use of mobile stroke units, clinical trials using anti-inflammation drugs on SARS-CoV-2 positive stroke patients, and COVID stroke rehabilitation centers.","Friedlich, Daniel; Newman, Tali; Bricker, Stephanie",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1052305721000410?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33540335/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2021.105639; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1052305721000410,478
