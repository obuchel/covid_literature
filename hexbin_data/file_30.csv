36,36,36,"Neutrophil elastase, an acid-independent serine protease, facilitates reovirus uncoating and infection in U937 promonocyte cells",11.636994,9.213678,2005-05-31,"BACKGROUND: Mammalian reoviruses naturally infect their hosts through the enteric and respiratory tracts. During enteric infections, proteolysis of the reovirus outer capsid protein σ3 is mediated by pancreatic serine proteases. In contrast, the proteases critical for reovirus replication in the lung are unknown. Neutrophil elastase (NE) is an acid-independent, inflammatory serine protease predominantly expressed by neutrophils. In addition to its normal role in microbial defense, aberrant expression of NE has been implicated in the pathology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Because reovirus replication in rodent lungs causes ARDS-like symptoms and induces an infiltration of neutrophils, we investigated the capacity of NE to promote reovirus virion uncoating. RESULTS: The human promonocyte cell line U937 expresses NE. Treatment of U937 cells with the broad-spectrum cysteine-protease inhibitor E64 [trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane] and with agents that increase vesicular pH did not inhibit reovirus replication. Even when these inhibitors were used in combination, reovirus replicated to significant yields, indicating that an acid-independent non-cysteine protease was capable of mediating reovirus uncoating in U937 cell cultures. To identify the protease(s) responsible, U937 cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an agent that induces cellular differentiation and results in decreased expression of acid-independent serine proteases, including NE and cathepsin (Cat) G. In the presence of E64, reovirus did not replicate efficiently in PMA-treated cells. To directly assess the role of NE in reovirus infection of U937 cells, we examined viral growth in the presence of N-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val chloromethylketone, a NE-specific inhibitor. Reovirus replication in the presence of E64 was significantly reduced by treatment of cells with the NE inhibitor. Incubation of virions with purified NE resulted in the generation of infectious subviron particles that did not require additional intracellular proteolysis. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that NE can facilitate reovirus infection. The fact that it does so in the presence of agents that raise vesicular pH supports a model in which the requirement for acidic pH during infection reflects the conditions required for optimal protease activity. The capacity of reovirus to exploit NE may impact viral replication in the lung and other tissues during natural infections.","Golden, Joseph W; Schiff, Leslie A",Virol J,30,1
500,500,500,"RNA and DNA Bacteriophages as Molecular Diagnosis Controls in Clinical Virology: A Comprehensive Study of More than 45,000 Routine PCR Tests",11.9278755,9.144463,2011-02-09,"Real-time PCR techniques are now commonly used for the detection of viral genomes in various human specimens and require for validation both external and internal controls (ECs and ICs). In particular, ICs added to clinical samples are necessary to monitor the extraction, reverse transcription, and amplification steps in order to detect false-negative results resulting from PCR-inhibition or errors in the technical procedure. Here, we performed a large scale evaluation of the use of bacteriophages as ICs in routine molecular diagnosis. This allowed to propose simple standardized procedures (i) to design specific ECs for both DNA and RNA viruses and (ii) to use T4 (DNA) or MS2 (RNA) phages as ICs in routine diagnosis. Various technical formats for using phages as ICs were optimised and validated. Subsequently, T4 and MS2 ICs were evaluated in routine real-time PCR or RT-PCR virological diagnostic tests, using a series of 8,950 clinical samples (representing 36 distinct specimen types) sent to our laboratory for the detection of a variety of DNA and RNA viruses. The frequency of inefficient detection of ICs was analyzed according to the nature of the sample. Inhibitors of enzymatic reactions were detected at high frequency in specific sample types such as heparinized blood and bone marrow (>70%), broncho-alveolar liquid (41%) and stools (36%). The use of T4 and MS2 phages as ICs proved to be cost-effective, flexible and adaptable to various technical procedures of real-time PCR detection in virology. It represents a valuable strategy for enhancing the quality of routine molecular diagnosis in laboratories that use in-house designed diagnostic systems, which can conveniently be associated to the use of specific synthetic ECs. The high rate of inhibitors observed in a variety of specimen types should stimulate the elaboration of improved technical protocols for the extraction and amplification of nucleic acids.","Ninove, Laetitia; Nougairede, Antoine; Gazin, Celine; Thirion, Laurence; Delogu, Ilenia; Zandotti, Christine; Charrel, Remi N.; De Lamballerie, Xavier",PLoS One,30,1
549,549,549,Monitoring the Systemic Human Memory B Cell Compartment of Melanoma Patients for Anti-Tumor IgG Antibodies,12.0453825,9.07706,2011-04-29,"Melanoma, a potentially lethal skin cancer, is widely thought to be immunogenic in nature. While there has been much focus on T cell-mediated immune responses, limited knowledge exists on the role of mature B cells. We describe an approach, including a cell-based ELISA, to evaluate mature IgG antibody responses to melanoma from human peripheral blood B cells. We observed a significant increase in antibody responses from melanoma patients (n = 10) to primary and metastatic melanoma cells compared to healthy volunteers (n = 10) (P<0.0001). Interestingly, we detected a significant reduction in antibody responses to melanoma with advancing disease stage in our patient cohort (n = 21) (P<0.0001). Overall, 28% of melanoma patient-derived B cell cultures (n = 1,800) compared to 2% of cultures from healthy controls (n = 600) produced antibodies that recognized melanoma cells. Lastly, a patient-derived melanoma-specific monoclonal antibody was selected for further study. This antibody effectively killed melanoma cells in vitro via antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity. These data demonstrate the presence of a mature systemic B cell response in melanoma patients, which is reduced with disease progression, adding to previous reports of tumor-reactive antibodies in patient sera, and suggesting the merit of future work to elucidate the clinical relevance of activating humoral immune responses to cancer.","Gilbert, Amy E.; Karagiannis, Panagiotis; Dodev, Tihomir; Koers, Alexander; Lacy, Katie; Josephs, Debra H.; Takhar, Pooja; Geh, Jenny L.

By paired serology, 3.9% (7 of 180) and 6.1% (11 of 180) of patients were confirmed to have acute scrub or murine typhus, respectively. The PCR assays for the detection of O. tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia spp. had high specificity (99.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 96.8–100] and 100% [95% CI: 97.8–100], respectively). The PCR results were also compared with immunoglobulin M (IgM) immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on acute sera. For O. tsutsugamushi, PCR sensitivity was twice that of acute specimen IgM IFA (28.6% versus 14.3%; McNemar's P = 0.3). For Rickettsia spp., PCR was four times as sensitive as acute specimen IgM IFA (36.4% versus 9.1%; P = 0.08), although this was not statistically significant. Whole blood and buffy coat, but not serum, were acceptable specimens for these PCRs. Further evaluation of these assays in a larger prospective study is warranted.","Watthanaworawit, Wanitda; Turner, Paul; Turner, Claudia; Tanganuchitcharnchai, Ampai; Richards, Allen L.; Bourzac, Kevin M.; Blacksell, Stuart D.; Nosten, François",Am J Trop Med Hyg,30,33
1342,1342,1342,CD13 promotes mesenchymal stem cell-mediated regeneration of ischemic muscle,11.904398,8.977167,2014-01-09,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent, tissue-resident cells that can facilitate tissue regeneration and thus, show great promise as potential therapeutic agents. Functional MSCs have been isolated and characterized from a wide array of adult tissues and are universally identified by the shared expression of a core panel of MSCs markers. One of these markers is the multifunctional cell surface peptidase CD13 that has been shown to be expressed on human and murine MSCs from many tissues. To investigate whether this universal expression indicates a functional role for CD13 in MSC biology we isolated, expanded and characterized MSCs from bone marrow of wild type (WT) and CD13(KO) mice. Characterization of these cells demonstrated that both WT and CD13(KO) MSCs expressed the full complement of MSC markers (CD29, CD44, CD49e, CD105, Sca1), showed comparable proliferation rates and were capable of differentiating toward the adipogenic and osteogenic lineages. However, MSCs lacking CD13 were unable to differentiate into vascular cells, consistent with our previous characterization of CD13 as an angiogenic regulator. Compared to WT MSCs, adhesion and migration on various extracellular matrices of CD13(KO) MSCs were significantly impaired, which correlated with decreased phospho-FAK levels and cytoskeletal alterations. Crosslinking human MSCs with activating CD13 antibodies increased cell adhesion to endothelial monolayers and induced FAK activation in a time dependent manner. In agreement with these in vitro data, intramuscular injection of CD13(KO) MSCs in a model of severe ischemic limb injury resulted in significantly poorer perfusion, decreased ambulation, increased necrosis and impaired vascularization compared to those receiving WT MSCs. This study suggests that CD13 regulates FAK activation to promote MSC adhesion and migration, thus, contributing to MSC-mediated tissue repair. CD13 may present a viable target to enhance the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell therapies.","Rahman, M.

2179,2179,2179,Clinical outcomes in outpatient respiratory syncytial virus infection in immunocompromised children,12.045458,9.20471,2016-03-23,"BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised patients are at high risk for morbidity and mortality due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Increasingly, pediatric patients with malignancy or undergoing transplantation are managed primarily as outpatients. Data regarding the clinical presentation and outcomes of RSV in the outpatient pediatric immunocompromised population are limited. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of children with hematologic malignancy or hematopoietic or solid organ transplant with laboratory‐confirmed RSV infection diagnosed as outpatients at an academic medical center between 2008 and 2013. RESULTS: Of 54 patients with RSV detected while outpatients, 15 (28%) were hospitalized, 7 (13%) received ribavirin, and one (2%) received intravenous immunoglobulin. One (2%) patient was critically ill, but there were no deaths due to RSV infection. Fever (P < 0·01) was associated with increased risk of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Most immunocompromised children with RSV detected while outpatients did not require hospitalization or receive antiviral treatment. Potential studies of RSV therapies should consider inclusion of patients in an ambulatory setting.","Chu, Helen Y.; Chin, Jennifer; Pollard, Jessica; Zerr, Danielle M.; Englund, Janet A.",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,30,28
3196,3196,3196,High Level Antibody Response to Pandemic Influenza H1N1/09 Virus Is Associated With Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Protein-3 rs12252-CC in Young Adults,11.92264,9.161323,2018-05-15,"Background: The C allele of the interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) SNP rs12252, a common allele in South East Asia and China, is strongly associated with severe influenza infection. However, despite the high occurrence of rs12252-CC genotype in Chinese population (~25%), severe influenza infection is rare. The aim of study is to determine whether rs12252-CC individuals have pre-existing antibody responses to previous seasonal influenza infections. Cohort and Method: A total 99 young healthy volunteers (18–20 years) were recruited and received an influenza seasonal Vaccination [A/Switzerland/9715293/2013(H3N2), A/California/7/2009 (pdm09H1N1) and B/Jeep/3073/2013-like virus (Flu-B)]. Plasma and gDNA was isolated from each volunteer before, and 14, 28, 180, 360, and 540 days after vaccination. Additionally, 68 elderlies (>65 years) were also recruited as a control group to compare the levels of antibodies at baseline between the young adults and the elderly. For each sample IFITM3 rs12252 genotype was determined and antibody levels in response to pdmH1N1, H3N2 and Influenza B infection were measured for each time point. Results: We found a significantly higher level of pre-existing antibodies to pandemic influenza H1N1/09 virus (pdm09H1N1) but not to H3N2 or FluB in CC donors in comparison with CT/TT donors prior to vaccination. No impact of IFITM3 genotype in boosting influenza specific antibodies in young adults within 1 year after receiving seasonal influenza vaccination was observed. In addition, there was no difference in pdm09H1N1 specific antibody levels observed in the elderly cohort between volunteers carrying different IFITM3 genotypes. Higher levels of antibodies to pdmH1N1 were observed in elderly CC carriers when compared to the young CC carriers, but this trend was not replicated in TT carriers. Conclusion: IFITM3-rs12252 CC carriers exhibit a high level of pre-existing immunity to pdm09H1N1 compared to TT carriers in the young cohort. This suggests that compensatory mechanisms exist which might contribute to viral control in patients carrying the rs12252-CC genotype who do not become sick after flu infection. However, such a potential compensatory effect appears to be lost overtime, as evidenced in the elderly cohort. If this compensatory mechanism is lost, it may make the CC carrying elderly more susceptible to severe influenza infection.","Qin, Ling; Wang, Dayan; Li, Dongfu; Zhao, Yan; Peng, Yanchun; Wellington, Dannielle; Dai, Yanchao; Sun, Huanqin; Sun, Jinping; Liu, Guihai; McMichael, Andrew; Dong, Tao; Zhang, Yonghong",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,30,28
3245,3245,3245,Evaluation of Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing for Detection of Bovine Pathogens in Clinical Samples,12.027838,9.07014,2018-06-25,"The laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases, especially those caused by mixed infections, is challenging. Routinely, it requires submission of multiple samples to separate laboratories. Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have provided the opportunity for development of a comprehensive method to identify infectious agents. This study describes the use of target-specific primers for PCR-mediated amplification with the NGS technology in which pathogen genomic regions of interest are enriched and selectively sequenced from clinical samples. In the study, 198 primers were designed to target 43 common bovine and small-ruminant bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic pathogens, and a bioinformatics tool was specifically constructed for the detection of targeted pathogens. The primers were confirmed to detect the intended pathogens by testing reference strains and isolates. The method was then validated using 60 clinical samples (including tissues, feces, and milk) that were also tested with other routine diagnostic techniques. The detection limits of the targeted NGS method were evaluated using 10 representative pathogens that were also tested by quantitative PCR (qPCR), and the NGS method was able to detect the organisms from samples with qPCR threshold cycle (C(T)) values in the 30s. The method was successful for the detection of multiple pathogens in the clinical samples, including some additional pathogens missed by the routine techniques because the specific tests needed for the particular organisms were not performed. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and indicate that it is possible to incorporate NGS as a diagnostic tool in a cost-effective manner into a veterinary diagnostic laboratory.","Anis, Eman; Hawkins, Ian K.; Ilha, Marcia R.

3447,3447,3447,LincRNA-p21 promotes mesenchymal stem cell migration capacity and survival through hypoxic preconditioning,12.084511,8.862544,2018-10-25,"BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow have potent stabilizing effects for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, low efficiency and survival in MSC homing to injured lung tissue remains to be solved. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess whether large intergenic noncoding RNA (LincRNA)-p21 promote MSC migration and survival capacity through hypoxic preconditioning in vitro. METHODS: MSCs were cultured and divided into the normoxia culture group (20% O2) and hypoxia culture group (1% O2). To determine roles and mechanisms, lentivirus vector-mediated LincRNA-p21 knockdown of MSCs and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) inhibitor KC7F2 were introduced. Additionally, MSC migration was analyzed by scratch test and transwell migration assays. MSC proliferation was tested by cell counting kit-8 and trypan blue dye. Apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-PE/7-AAD stained flow cytometry. Moreover, LincRNA-p21 and HIF-1α mRNA was measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and HIF-1α and CXCR4/7 protein were assayed by western blot (WB) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Apoptosis protein caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3 were investigated by WB analysis. Considering interactions between VHL and HIF-1α under LincRNA-p21 effect, co-immunoprecipitation was detected. RESULTS: Hypoxic preconditioning MSC promoted migration capacity and MSC survival than normoxia culture group. MSCs induced by hypoxic preconditioning evoked an increase in expression of LincRNA-p21, HIF-1α, and CXCR4/7(both were chemokine stromal-derived factor-1(SDF-1) receptors). Contrarily, blockade of LincRNA-p21 by shRNA and HIF-1α inhibitor KC7F2 abrogated upregulation of hypoxic preconditioning induced CXCR4/7 in MSCs, cell migration, and survival. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that hypoxic preconditioning isolated VHL and HIF-1α protein by increasing HIF-1α expression. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxic preconditioning was identified as a promoting factor of MSC migration and survival capacity. LincRNA-p21 promotes MSC migration and survival capacity through HIF-1α/CXCR4 and CXCR7 pathway under hypoxic preconditioning in vitro.","Meng, Shan-Shan; Xu, Xiu-Ping; Chang, Wei; Lu, Zhong-Hua; Huang, Li-Li; Xu, Jing-Yuan; Liu, Ling; Qiu, Hai-Bo; Yang, Yi; Guo, Feng-Mei",Stem Cell Res Ther,30,8

Recent studies have suggested that cell factors involved in autophagy, an evolutionally conserved pathway leading to the lysosomal degradation of protein aggregates and organelles during cellular stress, also have roles in macropinocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy-associated proteins are required for trafficking of EBOV into the cell body. Depleting cells of beclin 1, autophagy-related protein 7, or microtubule-associated protein 1A/B light chain 3B (LC3B) abolished EBOV uptake, owing to a block in vesicle formation at the cell surface. Both LC3B-I and LC3B-II interacted with macropinocytic structures. Our work indicates that, although various forms of LC3B possess an inherent ability to associate with forming macropinosomes, LC3B-II is critical for internalization of macropinocytic vesicles and, therefore, EBOV from the cell surface.","Shtanko, Olena; Reyes, Ann N; Jackson, William T; Davey, Robert A",J Infect Dis,30,3

The emergence of a new antigen type of influenza A virus (H5N1) in Hong Kong during 1997 and 1998 threatened a possible pandemic of a new influenza infection. The investigation for anti-influenza chemotherapies has progressed in the last decade whereas clinical trials of new compounds have been limited to amantadine, rimantadine and ribavirin. Fusion inhibitors which directly inhibit conformational change of haemagglutinin (HA), protease inhibitors which inhibit cleavage of HA to HA1 and HA2, RNA transcription inhibitors which inhibit cap formation of mRNA and antisense oligonucleotides targeted at mRNA of PB2 (a part of viral RNA polymerase) have been reported, in their development phases. Recently, 2 neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, zanamivir and oseltamivir (GS 4104), were used in clinical trials for the treatment of patients with influenza. Both agents showed promising results. A polyoxometalate, PM-523, inhibits fusion between the virus envelope and cell membrane and inhibits the penetration of the virus into cells.

This disease is endemic in Middle East, Asia, Africa and South-Eastern Europe with the mortality rate of 5–30%. CCHFV genome is composed of three segments: large, medium and small segments. M segment encodes a polyprotein (glycoprotein) so called glycoprotein N (Gn) which is considered as a potential druggable target for the effective therapy of CCHF. The complete structure of Gn is still not characterized. The aim of the current study is to predict the complete three-dimensional (3D-) structure of CCHFV Gn protein via threading-based modeling and investigate the residues crucial for binding with CCHFV envelop. The developed model displayed excellent stereo-chemical and geometrical properties. Subsequently structure based virtual screening (SBVS) was applied to discover novel inhibitors of Gn protein. A library of > 1300 anti-virals was selected from PubChem database and directed to the predicted binding site of Gn. The SBVS results led to the identification of thirty-seven compounds that inhibit the protein in computational analysis. Those 37 hits were subject to pharmacokinetic profiling which demonstrated that 30/37 compound possess safer pharmacokinetic properties. Thus, by specifically targeting Gn, less toxic and more potent inhibitors of CCHFV were identified in silico.

Strategies designed to limit community transmission, such as antiviral deployment, were largely ineffective due to both feasibility constraints and the generally mild nature of disease, resulting in incomplete case ascertainment. Reviews of national pandemic plans have identified pandemic impact, primarily linked to measures of transmissibility and severity, as a key concept to incorporate into the next generation of plans. While an assessment of impact provides the rationale under which interventions may be warranted, it does not directly provide an assessment on whether particular interventions may be effective. Such considerations motivate our introduction of the concept of pandemic controllability. For case-targeted interventions, such as antiviral treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis, we identify the visibility and transmissibility of a pandemic as the key drivers of controllability. Taking a case-study approach, we suggest that high-impact pandemics, for which control is most desirable, are likely uncontrollable with case-targeted interventions. Strategies that do not rely on the identification of cases may prove relatively more effective. By introducing a pragmatic framework for relating the assessment of impact to the ability to mitigate an epidemic (controllability), we hope to address a present omission identified in pandemic response plans.","McCaw, J.M.; Glass, K.; Mercer, G.N.; McVernon, J.",J Public Health (Oxf),30,3

This study aimed to evaluate the burnout level among Lithuanian dentists and its association with demographic variables, job satisfaction, and other job-related variables. The data were collected among dentists online or during professional conferences while using an anonymous questionnaire (n = 380). The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used to evaluate the burnout level. A Poisson regression was applied for the analysis of relationships between variables. We observed that 42.3% of the respondents had a high emotional exhaustion (EE) (95% confidence interval (CI): 37.4–42.3%), while 18.7% (95% CI: 15.0–22.9%) and 28,2% (95% CI: 23.4–32.6%) had high depersonalization (DP) and low personal accomplishment (PA), respectively. Nonetheless, 15.3% (95% CI: 11.8–18.9%) of the study population experienced a high level of overall burnout. An original job satisfaction index was elaborated. It was significantly associated with sum scores of all burnout dimensions: with the EE sum score (Ratio of Sum Score Means (RSSM) 1.54; 95% CI: 1.46–1.62), DP sum score (RSSM 1.59; 95% CI: 1.45–1.74), and PA sum score (RSSM 0.88; 95% CI: 0.84–0.92). It was concluded that Lithuanian dentists can be characterised by high burnout intensity and high prevalence of burnout, being especially evident in emotional exhaustion. The dentist with low job satisfaction appeared to be the most vulnerable to all burnout dimensions.","Slabšinskienė, Eglė; Gorelik, Andrej; Kavaliauskienė, Aistė; Zaborskis, Apolinaras",Int J Environ Res Public Health,30,1

The aim of this study was to analyze the undesirable effects of mild, moderate and high doses of rosuvastatin in CD-1 male mice who received a cholesterol-rich diet, focusing on the morphological and functional changes on hepatocyte mitochondria. In a mouse model we studied the combined administration of a cholesterol-rich diet along with mild and moderate doses of rosuvastatin (1, 2.5 or 5 mg/kg/day) during several days. After the animals were sacrificed, liver mitochondria were isolated for microscopic studies and to analyze the respiratory function. The respiratory control (state-3/state-4) was evaluated in mice who received high doses of rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin doses higher than 20 mg/kg/day induced premature death in mice with a hypercholesterolemic diet, but not in mice with a cholesterol-free diet. Doses from 2.5 to 5 mg/kg/day also induced morphological and functional alterations in mitochondria but these hypercholesterolemic animals survived longer. Giving 1 mg/kg/day, which is close to the maximal therapeutic dose for humans, did not affect mitochondrial architecture or respiratory function after two months of treatment. We analyzed the effect of rosuvastatin on hepatic tissue because it is where statins are mainly accumulated and it is the main site of endogenous cholesterol synthesis. Our results contribute to understand the side effects of rosuvastatin in hypercholesterolemic mice, effects that could also affect humans who are intolerant to statins.","Díaz-Zagoya, Juan C.; Marín-Medina, Alejandro; Zetina-Esquivel, Alma M.; Blé-Castillo, Jorge L.; Castell-Rodríguez, Andrés E.; Juárez-Rojop, Isela E.; Miranda-Zamora, Rodrigo",Sci Rep,30,28

Refractory septic shock leads to early circulatory failure and carries the worst prognosis. The pathophysiology is poorly understood despite studies of the microcirculatory defects and the immuno-paralysis. The acute circulatory distress is treated with volume expansion, administration of vasopressors (usually noradrenaline: NA), and inotropes. Ventilation and anti-infectious strategy shall not be discussed here. When circulation is considered, the literature is segregated between interventions directed to the systemic circulation vs. interventions directed to the micro-circulation. Our thesis is that, after stabilization of the acute cardioventilatory distress, the prolonged sympathetic hyperactivity is detrimental in the setting of septic shock. Our hypothesis is that the sympathetic hyperactivity observed in septic shock being normalized towards baseline activity will improve the microcirculation by recoupling the capillaries and the systemic circulation. Therefore, counterintuitively, antihypertensive agents such as beta-blockers or alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (clonidine, dexmedetomidine) are useful. They would reduce the noradrenaline requirements. Adjuncts (vitamins, steroids, NO donors/inhibitors, etc.) proposed to normalize the sepsis-evoked vasodilation are not reviewed. This itemized approach (systemic vs. microcirculation) requires physiological and epidemiological studies to look for reduced mortality.","Petitjeans, Fabrice; Geloen, Alain; Pichot, Cyrille; Leroy, Sandrine; Ghignone, Marco; Quintin, Luc",J Clin Med,30,28

The spike protein of SARS-CoV consists of S1 and S2 domains, which are responsible for virus binding and fusion, respectively. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) positioned in S1 can specifically bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on target cells, and ACE2 regulates the balance between vasoconstrictors and vasodilators within the heart and kidneys. Here, a recombinant fusion protein containing 193-amino acid RBD (residues 318–510) and glutathione S-transferase were prepared for binding to target cells. Additionally, monoclonal RBD antibodies were prepared to confirm RBD binding to target cells through ACE2. We first confirmed that ACE2 was expressed in various mouse cells such as heart, lungs, spleen, liver, intestine, and kidneys using a commercial ACE2 polyclonal antibody. We also confirmed that the mouse fibroblast (NIH3T3) and human embryonic kidney cell lines (HEK293) expressed ACE2. We finally demonstrated that recombinant RBD bound to ACE2 on these cells using a cellular enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoassay. These results can be applied for future research to treat ACE2-related diseases and SARS.","Kim, Hyun; Hong, Yeongjin; Shibayama, Keigo; Suzuki, Yasuhiko; Wakamiya, Nobutaka; Kim, Youn Uck",Genes Genomics,30,1

We describe here the comparative incidence of community respiratory virus (CRV) infections occurring by day 180 post-transplant by donor source and their impact on outcomes including survival, relapse, chronic GVHD, and transplant related mortality (TRM) using CIBMTR registry data. The analysis included 2765 patients, all > 2 years of age, who underwent first allogeneic HCT for AML, ALL or MDS from 100 centers between 2012 and 2017 receiving either HaploCy (n=757), Matched related donor (MRD) transplant with PTCy (SibCy n= 403), and MRD transplant with calcineurin inhibitor and either MTX or MMF (SibCNI n= 1605). The cumulative incidences of CRV in the HaploCy, SibCy and SibCNI were: 3% (99% CI, 1.6-4.8), 3% (1.3-5.5) and 2.4 %(1.5-3.5) respectively at day 30 (P =0.649, NS), but notably higher at 15.5% (12.3-19), 16.2% (11.7-21.2) and 9.4 %(7.6-11.4) at 6 months (P<.001) post-transplant [Figure 1]. Identified CRV included primarily Rhinovirus, Parainfluenza, and RSV accounting for approximately 70% of all CRV reported [Table 1]. Figure 2 shows the multivariable models through 2 years post-transplant for survival, relapse, TRM, and chronic GVHD with a reference group of SibCNI without CRV infection for the main effect variable of donor type and infection. Patients in the HaploCy cohort who developed a CRV by day 180 had a higher risk of TRM [p=0.002] and inferior survival [p = 0.001] compared to the reference group. Older age, more advanced disease, and higher HCT-CI were all associated with increased mortality. The incidence of CRVs is higher for patients receiving PTCy, regardless of donor. This finding justifies further studies to understand long-term antiviral immune recovery in different donor sources and GVHD prophylaxis regimens. The higher overall mortality for HaploCy patients developing CRV infection warrants consideration for patient education and heightened awareness for clinicians, as well as long term follow up studies of such patients.","Taplitz, Randy; Maziarz, Richard T.; Mulroney, Carolyn; Perales, Miguel; Romee, Rizwan; Goldsmith, Scott R.; Fuchs, Ephraim J.; Bashey, Asad; Ciurea, Stefan O.; Singh, Anurag K; Ganguly, Siddhartha; Kim, Soyoung; Chen, Min; Chemaly, Roy F.; Komanduri, Krishna V.; Riches, Marcie L.",Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,30,1

Expression of CD89 can be stimulated by inflammatory cytokines, activated complement factors and certain microbial components. In one study, unstimulated phagocytes were able to ingest IgA antibody‐treated pneumococci, but only in the presence of complement, which was found to be activated by the IgA antibodies along the alternative pathway. Pneumococci produce IgA1 protease that cleaves human IgA1, but not IgA2, molecules in the hinge region. This leaves IgA1 as Fabα (monovalent) deprived of Fcα which contains the docking site for CD89. IgA1 is the vastly predominant subclass of IgA in the upper airways and circulation of humans. Aims: To examine the effects of IgA1 protease activity and complement on phagocytosis of IgA antibody‐coated pneumococci by an unstimulated human phagocytic cell line (hl60). Materials and methods: IgA1 and IgA2 monoclonal antibodies to serotype 4 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (ps) were generated by heterohybridoma technique involving B cells from human vaccinees. Isogenic serotype 4 pneumococci with and without IgA1 protease activity, respectively, were obtained after inactivation of the iga gene of the TIGR4 strain. Opsonophagocytosis was quantitated using the assay described by Romero‐Steiner et al. Based on enumeration of surviving bacteria by culture. The integrity of IgA molecules was examined by western blotting. Results: Both IgA1 and IgA2 antibody to type‐4 polysaccharide‐induced phagocytosis of IgA1 protease‐deficient type‐4 pneumococci equally well in the absence as in the presence of complement. Iga1 antibody to type‐4 polysaccharide displayed a fourfold higher opsonophagocytosis titer against IgA1 protease deficient compared to homologous wildtype target bacteria. A similar effect of IgA1 protease activity of the target bacteria was not observed in a parallel experiment where IgA2 antibody to type‐4 polysaccharide served as opsonin. IgA1 antibody extracted from IgA1 protease‐producing target bacteria was almost exclusively in the form of Fabα. Conversely, IgA1 from protease‐deficient bacteria and IgA2 from both types of bacteria were intact. Conclusions: These results indicate that the IgA1 protease activity of S. neumoniae may help the bacteria escape IgA1 antibody‐mediated opsonophagocytosis. Besides, in these experiments, IgA‐mediated opsonophagocytosis was independent of complement.","Reinholdt, J.; Baxendale, H.; Ekström, N.; Kayhty, H.; Poulsen, K.; Kilian, M.",Scand J Immunol,30,1

There has been an associated proliferation of resources and online initiatives to support frontline workers, however, few of these are directly targeted at the care home workforce. Care home workers are highly skilled in caring for people with complex needs, but have very variable levels of formal training, and just over half of care homes in Scotland include registered nurses. This project will rapidly collate existing resources and identify, direct from care home workers, their best practice, initiatives, and resources used to support resilience and retention during this pandemic and moving forward. METHODS: 1) Rapid review of care home specific evidence and resources (including published research and social media); 2) Online survey of Enabling Research in Care Homes (ENRICH) members across Scotland (n = 55); 3) Case studies within six care homes to identify what is working well and what is not in terms of promoting resilience and emotional support. RESULTS: The rapid review has identified a wide range of resources directed at supporting staff working in care homes; the survey and case studies will provide data on the key learning and resources that have supported staff, and outline the challenges identified. There are many resources available but staff do not access these. The role of the care home manager is key. KEY CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive review of resources and initiatives will make a valuable contribution to policy and practice designed to reduce burnout and foster retention not just in care homes but more widely across health and social care.","Johnston, L; Malcolm, C; Rambabu, L; Hockley, J; Shenkin, S D",Age Ageing,30,22

However, previous abdominal surgery is generally regarded as a contraindication to the laparoscopic approach because it causes intraperitoneal adhesions, which are thought to interfere with subsequent laparoscopic procedures inside the abdominal cavity. Few studies have examined the influence of prior surgery on laparoscopic nephrectomy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of previous laparotomy on laparoscopic nephrectomy. METHODS The records of 251 consecutive patients who had undergone laparoscopic nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma at our hospital between 2005 and 2015 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS Of the 251 laparoscopic nephrectomy patients, 76 patients (30%) had undergone prior abdominal surgery (surgery group), whereas the remaining 175 patients (70%) had not previously had abdominal surgery (control group). There were no significant differences between the control group and the surgery group with regard to pneumoperitoneum time (143 vs 135 min, P = 0.241) or blood loss (39 vs 36 mL, P = 0.763). Next, we divided the patients into two cohorts based on surgeon experience: 98 patients had been treated by an expert (i.e. someone who performs more than 50 laparoscopic procedures per year) and 153 patients had been treated by a non-expert. There was no significant difference in pneumoperitoneum time between the control and surgery groups in each cohort (treated by experts, 108 vs 103 min; treated by non-experts: 162 vs 166 min). CONCLUSION We conclude that laparoscopic nephrectomy may be feasible after previous abdominal surgery and could be one of the surgical options.","Yanai, Yoshinori; Takeda, Toshikazu; Miyajima, Akira; Matsumoto, Kazuhiro; Hagiwara, Masayuki; Mizuno, Ryuichi; Kikuchi, Eiji; Asanuma, Hiroshi; Oya, Mototsugu",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,30,31

METHODS In this study, cell models of overexpressed or silenced RNF6 were established by liposome transfection, and IM-12 was used as the inhibitor of GSK3β. Real-time quantitative PCR and western blots were used to detect the expression of RNF6, p-GSK3β, GSK3β, and β-catenin, and MTT assays were used to quantify cell proliferation. The tumorigenicity of cells was observed by plate clonal formation assay; the invasiveness of cells was examined in Transwell Boyden chambers, and the migratory capacity of cells was tested by scratch wound assays. The rat CRC model was induced by AOM/DSS, in which we verified activity in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by examining GSK3β phosphorylation. RESULTS RNF6 was upregulated in CRC samples and cell lines. Silencing or overexpressing RNF6 in colorectal cancer cells inhibited or promoted, respectively, the proliferation, tumorigenicity, invasion and migration of CRC cells, as well as expression of p-GSK3β, GSK3β and β-catenin. IM-12 reversed the Wnt/β-catenin-activated state change induced by RNF6 silencing and the inhibition of cell proliferation, tumorigenicity, invasion and migration. The same results were observed in vivo in the rat CRC model. CONCLUSIONS Overexpression of RNF6 in CRC increased the GSK3β phosphorylation level, which led to activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and promoted the invasion and migration of CRC cells, suggesting that RNF6 may be a novel target for the treatment of CRC.","Li, Qiken; Wang, Gang; Tao, Jinhua; Chen, Weiping","Pathology, research and practice",30,1

METHODS A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted in December 2017 to identify studies that report on the impact of media coverage or media interventions on stigma related to schizophrenia, psychosis, bipolar disorder, or mental illness in general. Data were synthesised narratively. RESULTS 12 studies met inclusion criteria; seven explored the impact of news media on stigma towards SMI or general mental illness, two explored the impact of social media, while three evaluated interventions that aimed to mitigate this impact. These studies showed that positive news reports and social media posts are likely to lead to reductions in stigmatizing attitudes and negative reports and social media posts are likely to increase stigmatizing attitudes. There were a limited number of interventions aiming to mitigate the negative impact of news reports of mental illness on stigma; however, these were ineffective. Interventions with media professionals appear to be successful at reducing their stigmatizing attitudes, but can also act to increase both positive and negative reports in the media. CONCLUSIONS Given the limited research evidence on the impact of news and social media on stigma towards SMI, and on the effectiveness of interventions aiming to mitigate this impact, further studies of higher quality are needed in this area. Due to mixed findings, interventions with media professionals are also an area of research priority.","Ross, Anna M; Morgan, Amy J; Jorm, Anthony F; Reavley, Nicola J",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,30,9

Effects of the PNiPAM loading level in the range of 0-40% by weight ( wt%) on the chemical, mechanical, thermal, and morphological properties of the CMC/PNiPAMx films (where x is the wt% of PNiPAM) were symmetrically investigated. The obtained CMC/PNiPAMx films showed a high compatibility between the polymers. The CMC/PNiPAM20 blend showed the greatest tensile strength and modulus at 37.9 MPa and 2.1 GPa, respectively. Moreover, the thermal degradation of CMC was retarded by the addition of PNiPAM. Scanning electron microscopy images of CMC/PNiPAM20 revealed a porous structure that likely supported Zn2+ movement in the SPEs containing zinc triflate, resulting in the high Zn2+ ion transference number (0.56) and ionic conductivity (1.68 × 10-4 S cm-1). Interestingly, the presence of PNiPAM in the CMC/PNiPAMx blends showed a greater stability during charge-discharge cyclic tests, indicating the ability of PNiPAM to suppress dendrite formation from causing a short circuit.

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a member of coronavirus, is the pathogen of TGE. We previously found NF-κB pathway was activated and 65 miRNAs were changed in response to inflammation caused by TGEV in cell line porcine intestinal epithelial cells-jejunum 2 (IPEC-J2). Bioinformatics results showed that these altered miRNAs were relevant to inflammation. In this study, the candidate targets of differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were predicted and analyzed using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. Based on the results of KEGG analysis, miR-885-3p might participate in regulating activation of NF-κB pathway and TNF pathway. To study the function of miR-885-3p, miR-885-3p mimics and inhibitors were artificially synthesized and respectively used for overexpression and silence of miR-885-3p in cells. Our results showed that miR-885-3p inhibited NF-κB signaling pathway and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production. B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (Bcl-10) was identified as the target of miR-885-3p, and promoted NF-κB pathway activation and TNF-α production. It was found that TGEV open reading frame 3b (TGEV-ORF3b) suppressed Bcl-10 expression, activation of NF-κB pathway, and TNF-α production by uniquely up-regulated miR-885-3p expression. Overall, the results indicated that TGEV-ORF3b counteracted NF-κB pathway and TNF-α via regulating miR-885-3p and Bcl-10.","Guo, Jianxiong; Zhao, Xiaomin; Liu, Zhihao; Liu, Dan; Tang, Xiaoyi; Wang, Kaili; Wang, Mengli; Huang, Yong; Tong, Dewen",Veterinary microbiology,30,31

To reduce these complications, we developed and propose a modified technique that has a superior biomechanical strength and a potential to reduce such postoperative complications. PATIENT CONCERNS The patient presented with pain and mild swelling in his left knee after he slipped on the floor and fell on his left knee. He has no significant past medical or surgical history. The patient took the tension band wiring as the first choice because of the wide acceptance. But he worried about the complications. DIAGNOSES X-ray showed a transverse fracture of the left patella with an inferior pole occult fracture. INTERVENTIONS The patient was operated with a modified technique of the classic tension band wiring for patellar fractures. In our 4-step procedure, double tension cerclage wires were wrapped under the exposed ends of the Kirschner wires (K-wires) and the tendons in figure-of-8 fashion. The aim was to increase the biomechanical strength so that when one of the tension wires fail, the other one can hold the fragments together. OUTCOMES The patient recovered very well and without any complications. The patient was followed-up for 1 year and the fracture has united very well, with satisfying knee range of motion. LESSONS From this case study, we can detect the biomechanical advantages of our technique which can increase the stability of the fracture and that allows early functional exercise and additionally the micromotion at the fracture site has a beneficial effect of fracture union. Based on the perfect outcomes, our technique is worthy of clinical application.","Yu, Tiecheng; Wu, Zhendong; Mohamed, Sayid Omar; Ju, Weina; Liu, Xiuxin; Qi, Baochang",Medicine,30,31

METHODS Between 2007 and 2011, a total of 243 patients underwent anterior resection using the double stapling technique for rectal cancer at our institution. We excluded 67 patients with diverting stoma and divided the remaining patients into two groups: patients who did not receive a transanal tube and diverting stoma (n = 140; control group) and those who received a transanal tube (n = 36). We compared the rate of anastomotic leakage, evaluated the complications associated with the transanal tube, and analyzed the risk factors for anastomotic leakage. RESULTS The following perioperative parameters were significantly different between the two groups as follows (control group vs. transanal tube group): diabetes mellitus (8 [22 %] vs. 12 [8.5 %] patients, respectively; p = 0.03), surgical duration (262 ± 54.1 min [171-457] vs. 233 ± 61.7 min [126-430], respectively; p < 0.01). The postoperative anastomosis leakage appeared significantly different between the two groups (1 [2.7 %] vs. 22 [15.7 %] patients, respectively; p = 0.04). Anastomotic leakage was significantly associated with the distance between the anastomosis line and the anal verge (odds ratio [OR] 8.58; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.53-48.0; p = 0.01) and non-use of a transanal tube (OR 11.1; 95 % CI 1.04-118; p = 0.04) in both univariate and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS Placement of a transanal tube is effective in decreasing the rate of anastomotic leakage after anterior resection using the double stapling technique.

Because IL-17A and IL-17F, ligands for IL-17 receptor antagonist (IL-17RA), have been shown to mediate neutrophil migration into the lung in response to LPS or Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia, we hypothesized that IL-17RA signaling was critical for acute lung injury in response to pulmonary influenza infection. IL-17RA was critical for weight loss and both neutrophil migration and increases in tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) after influenza infection. However, IL-17RA was dispensable for the recruitment of CD8(+) T cells specific for influenza hemagglutinin or nucleocapsid protein. Consistent with this, IL-17RA was not required for viral clearance. However, in the setting of influenza infection, IL-17RA(-/-) mice showed significantly reduced levels of oxidized phospholipids, which have previously been shown to be an important mediator in several models of acute lung injury, including influenza infection and gastric acid aspiration. Taken together, these data support targeting IL-17 or IL-17RA in acute lung injury due to acute viral infection.","Crowe, Christopher R; Chen, Kong; Pociask, Derek A; Alcorn, John F; Krivich, Cameron; Enelow, Richard I; Ross, Ted M; Witztum, Joseph L; Kolls, Jay K",Journal of immunology,30,1

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional survey. METHODS Between March and May 2020, a survey consisting of 20 common descriptors for dizziness within five domains (lightheadedness, motion sensitivity, imbalance, vision complaints, and pain) was completed by patients at two outpatient otolaryngology clinics. Surveys were subsequently obtained from otolaryngology and non-otolaryngology providers attending a multidisciplinary dizziness lecture. The primary outcome measure was to assess for differences in definition of dizziness between patients and providers. Secondary outcome measures included assessing differences between otolaryngologists and non-otolaryngologists. RESULTS About 221 patients and 100 providers participated. Patients selected a median of 7 terms compared to 8 for providers (P = .375), although providers had a larger overall distribution of number of terms selected (P = .038). Patients were more likely than providers to define dizziness according to the following domains: lightheadedness (difference 15.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.5%-25.3%), vision complaints (difference 21.6%, 95% CI 12.0%-29.6%), and pain (difference 11.5%, 95% CI 4.7%-17.1%). Providers were more likely to define dizziness according to the motion sensitivity domain (difference 13.8%, 95% CI 6.8%-19.6%). Otolaryngology and non-otolaryngology providers defined dizziness similarly across symptom domains. CONCLUSION Although patients and providers both view dizziness as imbalance, patients more commonly describe dizziness in the context of lightheadedness, vision complaints, and pain, whereas providers more frequently define dizziness according to motion sensitivity. These semantic differences create an additional barrier to effective patient-provider communication. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 4.

METHODS We examined the prevalence, clinical and angiographic characteristics, management and procedural outcomes of balloon uncrossable lesions in a multicenter chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) registry. RESULTS Between 2012 and 2016, 718 CTO PCIs (in which the occlusion was successfully crossed with a guidewire) were performed in 701 patients at 11 US centers. Mean age was 65.6 ± 10 years and 84% of the patients were men. Balloon uncrossable lesions represented 9% of all CTOs. Balloon uncrossable CTOs had more moderate/severe calcification (82% vs. 52%, P < 0.0001), moderate/severe tortuosity (61% vs. 35% P < 0.0001) and higher J-CTO score (2.95 ± 1.32 vs. 2.43 ± 1.23, P = 0.005) as compared with the remaining lesions. Technical and procedural success was significantly lower for balloon uncrossable lesions (90.5% vs. 98.3%, P < 0.0001 and 88.9% vs. 96.6% P = 0.004), respectively, but the incidence of major adverse events was similar (1.6% vs. 2.2%, P = 0.751). Balloon uncrossable lesions required longer procedure (208 [interquartile range: 135, 258] vs. 135 [94, 194] min, P < 0.0001) and fluoroscopy (77 [52, 100] vs. 45 min [27, 75], P < 0.0001) time.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs regulate the occurrence and development of various cancers and play an important role in GC progression. X-inactive specific transcript (XIST), a carcinogenic lncRNA, is involved in human tumourigenesis and is altered in GC. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), a transcription factor, is involved in cancer cell metastasis and differentiation. However, the exact mechanism underlying the biological roles of XIST and JAK2 in cancer cells remains unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study was conducted using GES-1, HGC-27, AGS and HEK-293 T cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to detect XIST, microRNA-337 (miR-337) and JAK2 expressions. GC cell invasion was investigated by using the Transwell assay. Fluorescein reporter gene detection was used to determine the relationship between JAK2 and XIST. RESULTS Compared with that in GES-1 cells, XIST expression was significantly up-regulated in AGS and HGC-27 cells. miR-337 expression in GC cell lines was decreased. The proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells were simultaneously inhibited by XIST knockdown, and the relationship between XIST and miR-337 was confirmed by bioinformatics analysis. JAK2 is expected to be the target gene of miR-337. MiR-337 can negatively regulate JAK2 expression in vitro. In addition, si-XIST decreased JAK2 expression by up-regulating miR-337 in vitro, thereby inhibiting GC cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, we speculated that XIST regulates JAK2 by competing with miR-337 as a competitive endogenous lncRNA in GC. CONCLUSION We elucidated the effects of migration and invasion after XIST inhibition, at least in part, by inhibiting miR-337 expression in GC cells to regulate JAK2. These data indicate that a positive feedback loop exists between XIST and JAK2 and suggest that JAK2 and XIST play a vital role in cancer cell migration and invasion.","Zheng, Wenqi; Li, Juan; Zhou, Xue; Cui, Li; Wang, Yunfang",Arab journal of gastroenterology : the official publication of the Pan-Arab Association of Gastroenterology,30,17

Vitamin-D has known immune modulatory effects and deficiency has been linked to increased severity of viral infections. Methods We evaluated patients admitted with confirmed SARS-COV-2 to our hospital between March-June 2020. Demographics and outcomes were assessed for those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with normal (>50 nmol/L) and low (<50 nmol/L) vitamin-D. Results There were 646 SARS-COV-2 PCR positive hospitalisations and 165 (25.5%) had plasma vitamin-D levels. Fifty patients were admitted to ICU. There was no difference in vitamin-D levels of those hospitalised (34, IQR 18.5-66 nmol/L) and those admitted to the ICU (31.5, IQR 21-42 nmol/L). Higher proportion of vitamin-D deficiency (<50 nmol/L) noted in the ICU group (82.0 vs. 65.2%). Among the ICU patients, low vitamin D level (<50 nmol/L) was associated with younger age (57 vs. 67 years, p=0.04) and lower Cycle Threshold (CT) real time polymerase chain reaction values (RT-PCR) (26.96 vs. 33.6, p=0.02) analogous to higher viral loads. However, there were no significant differences in ICU clinical outcomes (invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury and mechanical ventilation and hospital days) between patients with low and normal vitamin-D levels. Conclusions Despite the association of low vitamin-D levels with low CT values, there is no difference in clinical outcomes in this small cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients. The complex relationship between vitamin-D levels and COVID-19 infection needs further exploration with large scale randomized controlled trials.","Orchard, Laurence; Baldry, Matthew; Nasim-Mohi, Myra; Monck, Chantelle; Saeed, Kordo; Grocott, Michael P W; Ahilanandan, Dushianthan",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,30,1

Participants completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), the Systemic Clinical Outcome and Routine Evaluation (SCORE-15), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISK-2), and a self-report questionnaire for COVID-19 pandemic-related data. From a total of 5,116 adults included in the study, 5.20% reported suicidal thoughts, 14.17% were potential clinical cases of anxiety, and 26.51% of depression. Participants presented significantly higher suicidal ideation rates during the last two weeks of the lockdown compared to its previous two weeks. Unmarried or divorced marital status, mental health history, poor perceived quality of physical health, impaired family functioning, anxiety and depression symptoms were independently associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation, whereas higher resilience, positive feelings with regard to the lockdown measures, relationship with friends, and faith in a Supreme Being were associated with lower suicidal ideation odds. According to the findings, suicidal ideation prevalence might be considered elevated and its increase during the lockdown period alarming.

A deeper understanding of patient perspectives will inform strategies to optimize adherence with vision-preserving therapies. Objective To evaluate perceptions of COVID-19 exposure risk and their association with appointment attendance among patients at high risk of both reversible and irreversible vision loss from lapses in care. Design, Setting, and Participants This survey study included a nonvalidated telephone survey designed in April and May of 2020 and a retrospective medical record review conducted in parallel with survey administration from May 22 to August 18, 2020. Participants were recruited from 2 tertiary eye care centers (Emory Eye Center in Atlanta, Georgia, and W.K. Kellogg Eye Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan). The study included a random sample of patients with diagnoses of exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or diabetic retinopathy (DR) who received an intravitreal injection between January 6 and March 13, 2020, and were scheduled for a second injection between March 13 and May 6, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Association between perceptions regarding COVID-19 risks and loss to follow-up. Results Of 1004 eligible patients, 423 (42%) were successfully contacted, and 348 (82%) agreed to participate (participants' mean [SD] age, 75 [12] years; 195 women [56%]; 287 White [82%] patients). Respondents had a mean (SD) of 2.7 (1.1) comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19, and 77 (22%) knew someone with COVID-19. Of all respondents, 163 (47%) were very concerned or moderately concerned about vision loss from missed treatments during the pandemic. Although 208 (60%) believed the COVID-19 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), exposure at the eye clinic was extremely unlikely or unlikely, 49 (14%) believed it was extremely likely or likely. Seventy-eight participants (22%) were lost to follow-up. Concern regarding COVID-19 exposure during clinic visits (odds ratio [OR], 3.9; 95% CI, 1.8-8.4) and diagnosis of DR (vs AMD) (OR, 8.130; 95% CI, 3.367-20.408) were associated with an increase in likelihood of loss to follow-up. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients at high risk for vision loss from lapses in care, many expressed concerns regarding the effect of the pandemic on their ability to receive timely care. Survey results suggest that fear of SARS-CoV-2 exposure was associated with a roughly 4-fold increase in the odds of patient loss to follow-up. These results support the potential importance of clearly conveying infection-control measures.","Lindeke-Myers, Aaron; Zhao, Peter Yu Cheng; Meyer, Benjamin I; Liu, Elaine A; Levine, David A; Bennett, Olivia M; Ji, Sunjong; Newman-Casey, Paula Anne; Rao, Rajesh C; Jain, Nieraj",JAMA ophthalmology,30,31

A particular concern is the potential for viral transmission by way of aerosol which may be generated during perioperative care. There are currently no guidelines for the conduct of elective lung resection surgery in this context. METHODS A working group composed of 1 thoracic surgeon, 2 anesthesiologists and 1 critical care specialist assessed the risk for aerosol during lung resection surgery and proposed steps for mitigation. After external review, a final draft was approved by the Committee for the Governance of Perioperative and Surgical Activities of the Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, in Montreal, Canada. RESULTS The working group divided the risk for aerosol into 6 time-points: (1) intubation and extubation; (2) Lung isolation and patient positioning; (3) access to the chest; (4) conduct of the surgical procedure; (5) procedure termination and lung re-expansion; (6) chest drainage. Mitigating strategies were proposed for each time-point. CONCLUSIONS The situation with COVID-19 is an opportunity to re-evaluate operating room protocols both for the purposes of this pandemic and similar situations in the future. In the context of lung resection surgery, specific time points during the procedure seem to pose specific risks for the genesis of aerosol and thus should be the focus of attention.","Rakovich, George; Urbanowicz, Robert; Issa, Rami; Wang, Han Ting",Annals of surgery,30,30

In the CREDENCE trial canagliflozin reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) or cardiovascular (CV) death by 31%. In this current analysis we sought to determine whether the effect of canagliflozin on HHF/CV death differed in subgroups defined by key baseline participant characteristics. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Canagliflozin was associated with a reduction in the relative risk of HHF/CV death regardless of age, sex, history of HF or CV disease, and the use of loop diuretics or GLP1 receptor agonists (all pinteraction >0.114). The absolute benefit of canagliflozin was greater in those at highest baseline risk, such as those with CV disease (50 fewer events/1000 patients treated over 2.5years versus 20 fewer events in those without CV disease) or advanced kidney disease (eGFR 30-45 ml/min/1.73m2 : 61 events prevented/1000 patients treated over 2.5 years versus 23 events in eGFR 60-90 ml/min/1.73m2 ).

The aim of this study is to compare the surgical outcome of this approach with conventional laparoscopy for ectopic pregnancy. METHOD A review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement was performed. Electronic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus were searched in December 2017 by searching the terms ""single port laparoscopy"" or ""laparoendoscopic single site-surgery"" or ""single site laparoscopy"" or ""single-incision laparoscopic surgery"" and ""ectopic pregnancy."" Studies comparing the 2 techniques and reporting surgical outcome were selected. Endpoints included comparison of length of operative time (OT), hemoglobin drop, length of hospitalization, number of patients requiring packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion, intra- and post-operative complication rates between patients undergoing conventional laparoscopy and those undergoing LESS. RESULTS A total of 56 studies were retrieved of which 5 studies including 460 patients met selection criteria. No differences were found between conventional laparoscopy and LESS with regards to length of OT time (even after stratification for presence of hemoperitoneum and/or adhesions), length of hospitalization, mean hemoglobin drop, number of patients requiring transfusions of PRBC, and intra- and post-operative complications.

The psychological and social effects of the pandemic and to the restrictions of freedom could have had a detrimental impact on people with physical disabilities, for whom well-being depends strongly on their social environment. AIM Our main aim was to describe the overall impact of the pandemic on mental health, social condition and illness perception among patients with disabilities, to provide early interventions for this particularly vulnerable population. For this purpose, we performed a specific screening protocol to detect the prevalence of any psychological distress. DESIGN Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING Telephonic interview administered to patients and their caregivers attending the Neurorehabilitation unit of the University Hospital of Pisa. POPULATION 134 patients with physical disability related to neurological disorders, who had their outpatient appointment cancelled, because of the government dispositions, were enrolled. METHODS A specific questionnaire (COVID19-q) was designed to test patients' psychosocial state, including a section addressed to the caregiver. Moreover, a standardized psychological evaluation, using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), was also performed. RESULTS Results show a different impact in our study population compared to the general population on psychological aspect. Patients did not manifest any clinically relevant distress, as assessed with CORE-OM. However, patients with higher disability degree reported a statistically lower outcome in the social function and in the well-being domains and an increase in risk behaviour. Results from COVID19-q show that most of our patients reported none or mild change in their psycho-social habits and perception of illness during lockdown. However, reduction of family cohesion and lack of healthcare support are two important aspects that people with disability had to face with during the pandemic emergency. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT People with physical disabilities surprisingly shown milder effects of the pandemic on their psychological state and good coping skills in facing social isolation, manifesting resilience resources. However, the is a need to give concrete support to healthcare and social care, especially in the management of severe disability.

Family members often witness the event and attempt resuscitation. The physiological and psychological impact of a loved one's death, witnessed or unwitnessed, can be significant and long-lasting. However, little is known about the care needs of families during the cardiac arrest care of a loved one. This scoping review protocol was designed with, and will be performed in partnership with, persons with lived experience of sudden cardiac arrest (survivors and family members of survivors and nonsurvivors alike). METHODS The review will be performed in accordance with accepted methods such as the Arksey and O'Malley methodology framework and the Levac extension. We will search multiple databases, and Google Scholar for both qualitative and quantitative scientific literature. Articles will be screened, extracted, and analyzed by a team with lived experience of cardiac arrest. Two reviewers will conduct all screening and data extraction independently. A descriptive overview, tabular and/or graphical summaries, and a directed content analysis will be carried out on extracted data. DISCUSSION This protocol outlines a planned literature review to systematically examine the nature of existing evidence to describe what the care needs of families experiencing the cardiac arrest of a loved one are. Such evidence will contribute to the development of strategies to meet identified care needs. Persons with lived experience participated in the creation of this protocol, and they will also participate in the execution of this review as partners and coinvestigators, not as research subjects or participants. The results of the scoping review will be disseminated upon completion of the work described in this protocol.","Douma, Matthew J; Ali, Samina; Bone, Allison; Dainty, Katie N; Dennett, Liz; Smith, Katherine E; Frazer, Kate; Kroll, Thilo",Journal of emergency nursing,30,11

This case series aims to characterize cases of tocilizumab-associated clinically significant hepatic injury. We analyzed cases of severe acute liver injury associated with tocilizumab reported in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the medical literature. We identified 12 cases in which tocilizumab was a suspected primary cause of liver injury and 8 cases in which serious sequelae of underlying or coincident viral hepatitis were temporally associated with its use. Using the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) severity scale, 5 of 12 cases were Grade 5 (2 liver transplants, 3 deaths), 1 was Grade 4 (liver failure), and 6 were Grade 3 (serious events with elevated bilirubin). Two cases reported liver atrophy with low hepatocellular expression of Ki-67, a marker of cellular proliferation. Among the 8 cases of tocilizumab-associated viral hepatitis exacerbation, 3 were scored as DILIN Severity Grade 5 (1 liver transplant, 2 deaths), 1 was Grade 4 (liver failure), and 4 were Grade 3. The reported viral hepatitis events were Hepatitis B virus reactivation (n=3), Hepatitis C virus flare (n=1), Cytomegalovirus-induced liver failure (n=1), Epstein-Barr virus hepatitis (n=1), acute Hepatitis E (HEV, n=1), and HEV-induced macrophage activation syndrome (n=1). Tocilizumab may be a primary cause of severe liver injury, as well as exacerbate underlying viral hepatitis. The disruption by tocilizumab of IL-6-mediated immune protection and hepatocyte regeneration may aggravate clinical outcomes in some cases.","Biehl, Ann; Harinstein, Lisa; Brinker, Allen; Glaser, Rachel; Munoz, Monica; Avigan, Mark",Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,30,0

However, little is known about what factors drive employees' daily decisions to work from home versus office during the pandemic. Taking a social ecological perspective, we conceptualize employees' daily choice of work location (home vs. office) as a way to cope with stressors they have encountered on the previous day, and conducted a daily diary study to examine how five categories of work-related and COVID-related stressors during the pandemic (identified through a pilot interview study) may jointly predict employees' next-day work location. We collected data over five workdays from 127 participants working in a Chinese IT company which allowed employees to choose their work location on a daily basis amid the pandemic. We found that experiencing more work-family boundary stressors and work coordination stressors on a certain day were associated with a greater likelihood of working in the office (vs. at home) on the next day, while experiencing more workload stressors prompted employees to work at home (vs. in the office) on the next day. Furthermore, we found that COVID-19 infection-related stressors moderated the effects of technology stressors and workload stressors on next-day work location.

It has resulted in multiple fatalities from SARSs all around the world. A year after the global pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported more than 79 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 1.7 million deaths, making it one of the worst and most difficult pandemics encompassed in the modern history. The ongoing triad of escalating infections, mortality, and economic loss has urgently called for recognizing SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mechanisms as a crucial step in the initial stages of infection and to which possible interventional strategies should be targeted. To mediate host cell infections, Coronaviruses utilize the immunogenic studded spikes glycoproteins on its surface as a key factor for attachment, fusion, and entrance to host cells. Herein, we shed the light on a potential strategy involving disruption of SARS-CoV-2 S protein interaction with host cell receptors through design of neutralizing antibodies targeting receptor binding domain in S1 subunit, small peptide inhibitors, peptide fusion inhibitors against S2, host cell angiotensin converting enzymes 2 (ACE2), and protease inhibitors, aiming to pave the way for controlling viral cell entrance.

For this reason, hysterectomy provides improvement in sexual function as well as symptoms such as bleeding and pain. The effects of abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) and laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH), which are the two most common types of hysterectomy today, are not clear. In our study, we investigated the effects of TAH and TLH on sexual function and quality of life as well as intraoperative and postoperative results. In 329 TLH and 126 TAH patients, we compared both and between themselves preoperatively and postoperatively by using the standardized and validated female sexual function index (FSFI) and European quality of life five-dimension scale (EQ-5D). In conclusion, we found that both types of hysterectomy were effective in improving sexual function, and we concluded that improvement in the laparoscopy group was statistically higher. Patients who require hysterectomy for benign gynecological reasons should be informed that TLH has a more positive effect on sexual function as well as other advantages, and if the patients' main complaint is sexual dysfunction, TLH should be preferred compared to TAH.","Beyan, Emrah; İnan, Abdurrahman H; Emirdar, Volkan; Budak, Adnan; Tutar, Sadettin O; Kanmaz, Ahkam G",BioMed research international,30,6

The diagnosis and treatment of this aggressive fungal infection are of clinical concern due to differences in species distribution in different geographic areas and susceptibility profiles between different species that are capable of causing highly aggressive infections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology and susceptibility profiles of Mucorales isolates in the U.S. over a 52-month period. Species identification was performed by combined phenotypic characteristics and DNA sequence analysis, and antifungal susceptibility testing was performed by CLSI M38 broth microdilution for amphotericin B, isavuconazole, itraconazole, and posaconazole. During this time-frame, 854 isolates were included, representing 11 different genera and over 26 species, of which Rhizopus (58.6%) was the predominant genus followed by Mucor (19.6%). The majority of isolates were cultured from the upper and lower respiratory tracts (55%). Amphotericin B demonstrated the most potent in vitro activity, with GM MICs of ≤0.25 μg/mL against all genera with the exception of Cunninghamella species (GM MIC 1.30 μg/mL). In head-to-head comparisons the most active azole was posaconazole followed by isavuconazole. Differences in azole and amphotericin B susceptibility patterns were observed between the genera with the greatest variability observed with isavuconazole. Awareness of the epidemiology of Mucorales isolates and differences in antifungal susceptibility patterns in the U.S. may aide clinicians in choosing antifungal treatment regimens. Further studies are warranted to correlate these findings with clinical outcomes.","Badali, Hamid; Cañete-Gibas, Connie; McCarthy, Dora; Patterson, Hoja; Sanders, Carmita; David, Marjorie P; Mele, James; Fan, Hongxin; Wiederhold, Nathan P",Journal of clinical microbiology,30,1

The brain's limitations in the heat is often ascribed to inadequate cerebral blood flow (CBF), but elevated intracranial pressure is commonly observed in mammalian models of heat stroke and can on its own cause functional impairment. The CBF response to incremental heat strain was dependent on the mode of heating, decreasing by 30% when exposed passively to hot, humid air (sauna), while remaining unchanged or increasing with passive hot-water immersion (spa) and exercising in a hot environment. Non-invasive intracranial pressure estimates (nICP) were increased universally by 18% at volitional thermal tolerance across all modes of heat stress, and therefore may play a contributing role in eliciting thermal tolerance. The sauna, more so than the spa or exercise, poses a greater challenge to the brain under mild to severe heating due to lower blood flow but similarly increased nICP. ABSTRACT The human brain is particularly vulnerable to heat stress; this manifests as impaired cognitive function, orthostatic tolerance, work capacity, and eventually, brain death. This vulnerability is often ascribed to inadequate cerebral blood flow (CBF); however, elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is also observed in mammalian models of heat stroke. We investigated the changes in CBF with incremental heat strain under three fundamentally different modes of heating, and assessed whether heating per se increased ICP. Fourteen fit participants (7 female) were heated to thermal tolerance or 40°C core temperature (Tc; oesophageal) via passive hot-water immersion (spa), passive hot, humid air exposure (sauna), cycling exercise, and cycling exercise with CO2 inhalation to prevent heat-induced hypocapnia. CBF was measured with duplex ultrasound at each 0.5°C increment in Tc and ICP was estimated non-invasively (nICP) from optic nerve sheath diameter at thermal tolerance. At thermal tolerance, CBF was decreased by 30% in the sauna (p<0.001), but unchanged in the spa or with exercise (p≥0.140). CBF increased by 17% when end-tidal PCO2 was clamped at eupneic pressure (p<0.001). On the contrary, nICP increased universally by 18% with all modes of heating (p<0.001). The maximum Tc was achieved with passive heating, and preventing hypocapnia during exercise did not improve exercise or thermal tolerance (p≥0.146). Therefore, the regulation of CBF is dramatically different depending on the mode and dose of heating, whereas nICP responses are not. The sauna, more so than the spa or exercise, poses a greater challenge to the brain under equivalent heat strain. This article is protected by copyright.

Thus, we evaluated patients treated with cognitive behavioral therapy-informed psychotherapy for seizures with clinical video telehealth (CVT). We evaluated neuropsychiatric and seizure treatment outcomes in veterans diagnosed with PNES seen remotely via telehealth. We hypothesized that seizures and comorbidities will improve with treatment. METHODS This was a single-arm, prospective, observational, cohort, consecutive outpatient study. Patients with video-electroencephalography-confirmed PNES (n = 32) documented their seizure counts daily and comorbid symptoms prospectively over the course of treatment. Treatment was provided using a 12-session manual-based psychotherapy treatment given once per week, via CVT with a clinician at the Providence Veterans Affairs Medical Center. RESULTS The primary outcome, seizure reduction, was 46% (P = .0001) per month over the course of treatment. Patients also showed significant improvements in global functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning, P = < .0001), quality of life (Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-31, P = .0088), and health status scales (Short Form 36 Health Survey, P < .05), and reductions in both depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II, P = .0028) and anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory, P = .0013) scores. SIGNIFICANCE Patients with PNES treated remotely with manual-based seizure therapy decreased seizure frequency and comorbid symptoms and improved functioning using telehealth. These results suggest that psychotherapy via telehealth for PNES is a viable option for patients across the nation, eliminating one of the many barriers of access to mental health care.","LaFrance, William Curt; Ho, Wing Lam Natalie; Bhatla, Alana; Baird, Grayson L; Altalib, Hamada Hamid; Godleski, Linda",Epilepsia,30,14

Previous impact evaluations indicated that a 6-week empowerment-based behavioral intervention in Nairobi informal (slum) settlements can reduce sexual assault. This qualitative study investigated girls' and boys' experiences of the intervention to identify potential mechanisms of change. METHODS We conducted a qualitative study in Nairobi slums with students (aged 15-21 years) who had participated in 2 parallel school-based curriculums called IMPower (girls) and Your Moment of Truth (boys) at least 1 year ago. Data were collected via 10 focus group discussions (5 for boys, 5 for girls) with 6-11 participants in each and 21 individual in-depth interviews (11 boys, 10 girls) that explored participants' experiences of the intervention and their suggestions for improvement. Findings were analyzed using thematic network analysis guided by empowerment theory. RESULTS Girls described how the intervention enabled them to recognize and resist sexual assault via verbal and physical strategies for self-protection, negotiate sexual consent, and exercise agency. Boys described increased ability to avoid risky behaviors and ""bad"" peer groups and to understand and respect consent. Girls also described how the intervention strengthened their self-confidence, and boys said that it boosted positive life values and gender-equal attitudes. Skilled facilitators and interactive and relevant content were highlighted as key to intervention success. Areas of improvement included expanding the curriculum to contain more content on sexual and reproductive health and rights and involving out-of-school youth, parents, teachers, and communities. CONCLUSION Findings indicate that a relatively short, behavioral school-based intervention can empower both girls and boys to prevent various forms of sexual violence in a low-income setting where it is endemic. Incorporating multilevel support structures, such as involving communities and families, could further enhance young people's long-term safety, health, and well-being.","Kågesten, Anna E; Oware, Phoene Mesa; Ntinyari, Wendy; Langat, Nickson; Mboya, Benjamin; Ekström, Anna Mia","Global health, science and practice",30,1

Its dysregulation underlies the pathophysiology of many different diseases, which makes functional assays of complement activity crucial; they are, however, underutilised. Standard haemolysis assays for the analysis of complement function employ sensitised non-human erythrocytes (e.g. from the sheep, guinea-pig or rabbit), the use of which raises animal welfare concerns. To provide an alternative to the use of such animal-derived products for complement function assays, we developed a method that employs modified human erythrocytes to evaluate the activity of complement pathways. Human erythrocytes were subjected to various chemical and/or proteolytic treatments involving 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonate (TNBS) and pancreatin. Haemolysis assays demonstrated that sequential treatment with TNBS and pancreatin resulted in significantly greater complement-mediated haemolysis, as compared to TNBS or pancreatin treatment alone. Evidence that lysis of the modified erythrocytes was complement-mediated was provided by the chelation and subsequent restoration of calcium in the plasma. Thus, such modified human erythrocytes could be used as an alternative to animal-derived erythrocytes in haemolysis assays, in order to evaluate complement activity in human plasma during, for example, the screening of patients for complement deficiencies and other abnormalities in a clinical setting.","King, Ruby Anne N; Climacosa, Fresthel Monica M; Santos, Bobbie Marie M; Caoili, Salvador Eugenio C",Alternatives to laboratory animals : ATLA,30,29

Nowadays it has been proven that a deficiency of certain micronutrients in the diet can disrupt chemical, structural and regulatory processes in the organism, which negatively affects, first of all, the state of immune system. Zinc is one of the most significant essential trace elements affecting immunological resistance. The aim of the study was to substantiate the need of including zinc-containing products and diet supplements in the diet of the population during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the basis of the study of pathogenetic mechanisms of various disorders of the immunological status under zinc deficit. Material and methods. This review analyzes the data from scientific electronic libraries CyberLeninka, eLIBRARY.RU, the Google Scholar databases and bibliographic medical databases MEDLINE and PubMed-NCBI. Results and discussion. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, adequate zinc supply is especially important, due to its antiviral, immunomodulatory and antiapoptotic effects. This element also regulates the severity of the cytokine response, exhibits antibacterial properties and helps to compensate for chronic comorbid diseases, which plays a particularly significant role in preventing severe SARS-CoV-2 and recurrent respiratory diseases. Prevention and correction of zinc deficiency is considered as one of the important measures during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, aimed at increasing antiviral and general immunity, reducing the systemic inflammatory response and correcting hormonal and metabolic status. Conclusion. The pathogenetically substantiated inclusion of zinc-containing foods and supplements in the diet will enhance the immunity of the population during the SARSCoV- 2 pandemic.","Sankova, M V; Kytko, O V; Dydykina, I S; Chilikov, V V; Laptina, V I; Markina, A D",Voprosy pitaniia,30,12

As of this time, there are no specific antiviral therapies available for the treatment of COVID-19. However, it is possible that some existing drugs, usually used for other conditions, may have some benefits. Statins have been widely reported to exert antiviral activity against many enveloped viruses by inhibiting the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Cholesterol likewise contributes to the coronavirus's life cycle, including viral entry, fusion and budding. In addition, statins have been ascribed beneficial anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effects and promote haemodynamic stability. Therefore, statins, which are cholesterol-lowering drugs with anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and antiviral properties, may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 therapy. The aim of the present minireview was to delineate the potential beneficial therapeutic effects of statins in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections. Nevertheless, large, randomised trials are needed to confirm the beneficial effects and safety profile of the statins in patients with SARS-CoV-2.","Fares, Auda; Borrmann, Dieter; Ivester, Julius R",Journal of infection prevention,30,1

This study reports our surgical results and introduces a simple technique with tips based on our experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS LESS surgery was performed on 116 patients by use of a homemade single-port device composed of an Alexis wound retractor and a powder-free surgical glove. Cases were 44 varicocelectomies (including 8 bilateral cases), 38 renal cyst marsupializations (including 3 bilateral cases), 26 ureterolithotomies (with 1 concomitant ureterolithotomy and contralateral renal cyst marsupialization), 4 prostatic enucleations, and 4 bladder rupture repairs. The mean patient age was 44.43±16.46 years (range, 11 to 76 years), and the male-to-female ratio was 87:29. RESULTS In one ureterolithotomy case, LESS was converted to conventional laparoscopic surgery. The mean operative time was 87.03±45.03 minutes, the estimated blood loss was 61.90 ml (range, 0 to 2,000 ml), and the mean hospital stay was 3.03±2.12 days. Two patients underwent single-port transvesical enucleation of the prostate (STEP) requiring patient-controlled anesthesia. No patients developed major complications, and all patients were satisfied, with 75.86% expressing a high degree of satisfaction.

Sixty-four Holstein calves, both male and female, were divided over two treatments. Calves either received IEP or a placebo (PCB) in their colostrum and calf milk replacer (CMR) for the first 14 days of their life. Until day 49, CMR was offered at 15% of birth weight (BW), at 10% on days 49-57 and at 5% on days 57-63. In addition, calves received starter concentrate, chopped straw and water from 3 days old until 70 days old at the end of study. Individual CMR and concentrate intake were measured daily whilst BW was recorded weekly. Visual faecal scoring and health observations were conducted daily. Faecal samples were collected weekly up to 4 weeks and during the first 4 days of scouring to screen for presence of Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus, coronavirus, E. coli and Salmonella. Results indicated that feeding IEP increased BW (p < .05) at 42 and 56 days old, and BW also tended (p = .06) to be higher after weaning at 63-70 days old compared to the PCB group. When analysed using a repeated measures model, compared to feeding PCB, feeding IEP increased total concentrate consumption (p = .001) by 3.6kg/calf. Over the entire study, daily water intake was higher (p = .002) for the IEP group when compared with the PCB group. In the IEP group, 12 calves were scored as scouring whereas there were 14 calves in the PCB group. There were no significant differences between treatments in faecal pathogen load of neither healthy nor scouring calves. In conclusion, supplementing IEP during the first 14 days of calf life improved the performance of newborn calves. Further work is warranted to understand the mode of action of IEP in calves.","van Kuijk, Sandra; Kinkead, Ruth; Scoley, Gillian; Morrison, Steven; Han, Yanming",Journal of animal physiology and animal nutrition,30,30

Most of these illnesses are due to viruses. However, investigations (radiography, blood and urine testing) to rule out bacterial infections and antibiotics are often ordered because of diagnostic uncertainties. This results in prolonged ED visits and unnecessary antibiotic use. The risk of concurrent bacterial infection has been reported to be negligible in children over three months of age with a confirmed viral infection. Rapid viral testing in the ED may alleviate the need for precautionary testing and antibiotic use. OBJECTIVES To determine the effect of rapid viral testing in the ED on the rate of precautionary testing, antibiotic use and ED length of visit. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2009, issue 1) which contains the ARI Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (1950 to April Week 3 2009), EMBASE (1988 to Week 16, 2009), MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (April 27, 2009), HealthStar (1966 to 2009), BIOSIS Previews (1969 to 2009), CAB Abstracts (1973 to 2007), CBCA Reference (1970 to 2007), and Proquest Dissertations and Theses (1861 to 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of rapid viral testing for children with ARIs in the ED. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors used the inclusion criteria to select trials, evaluate their quality and extract data. Missing data were obtained from trial authors. Differences in rate of investigations and antibiotics use were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and difference in ED length of visits was expressed as mean difference, with 95% confidence interval (CI). MAIN RESULTS Four trials were included, three RCTs and one quazi-RCT, with 759 children in the rapid viral testing and 829 in the control group. Rapid viral testing did not reduce antibiotic use in the ED significantly, neither clinically nor statistically. We found lower rates of chest radiography (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91) in the rapid viral testing group but no effect on length of ED visits, blood or urine testing in the ED. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Current evidence is insufficient, although promising, to support routine rapid viral testing as a means to reduce antibiotic use in pediatric EDs. Results suggest that rapid viral testing may be beneficial but are not statistically significant due to lack of power.

The SEM micrographs show that starch presented bimodal distribution (size 3.9-10.4 µm), while the smaller granules had a smooth surface and an oval or conical shape, the larger granules were spherical with holes and cracks on the surface. The starch presented low amylose content (<20%) and amylopectin branch chain length distribution with the absence of a shoulder, which is suggestive of perfect crystalline structure, and a higher proportion of medium chains (DP 13-24), despite the large number of short chains (DP 6-12), and on average DP 21. X-ray diffraction showed a mixture of polymorphs A and B, which can be considered C-type crystalline pattern, which is indicative of being a slow digestible starch. Through paste viscosity results, by RVA, we can observe low values for thermal and pasting properties, suggesting greater homogeneity of crystals. Also, due to interaction with lipids originally present (2.69%), the starch showed lower retrogradation rate (22.64%), which resulted in a weak gel after 24 h of storage. As a product with greater storage stability, peach palm fruit starch, extracted for the purpose of promoting its regional use, has shown that it can be used in products where slow and smooth retrogradation is desired, such as in breads, soups, chowder and porridges, without the use of emulsifiers or fat.","Ferrari Felisberto, Mária Herminia; Souza Costa, Mariana; Villas Boas, Flávia; Lopes Leivas, Carolina; Maria Landi Franco, Célia; Michielon de Souza, Sérgio; Pedrosa Silva Clerici, Maria Teresa; Mach Côrtes Cordeiro, Lucimara",Food research international,30,16

Despite the large number of nurses in practice, a variety of factors contribute to the availability of RNs able to meet health care-related demands, leading out-of-practice nurses to seek reentry into the workforce. To develop the skills and knowledge needed to deliver safe and effective care, nurses seeking to return to practice need access to formally structured continuing education opportunities. Nursing refresher courses have historically filled this gap, effectively supporting the reemployment of nurses by preparing them for clinical practice. The COVID-19 pandemic is among the most recent factors encouraging nurse reentry, thus furthering the need for continuing education in support of license renewal. This article provides insight into the development of a university-based refresher program for Texas nurses seeking to reactivate licensure and gain the theoretical and clinical knowledge needed to return to nursing considering the health care demands produced by this unprecedented crisis.

Surface coating of medical devices/implants using antibacterial peptides and enzymes has recently emerged as a potentially effective method for preventing infections. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of hernia repair meshes coated by the antimicrobial enzyme lysostaphin at different initial concentrations. Lysostaphin was adsorbed on pieces of polypropylene (Ultrapro) mesh with binding yields of ∼10 to 40% at different coating concentrations of between 10 and 500 μg/ml. Leaching of enzyme from the surface of all the samples was studied in 2% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline buffer at 37°C, and it was found that less than 3% of adsorbed enzyme desorbed from the surface after 24 h of incubation. Studies of antibacterial activity against a cell suspension of S. aureus were performed using turbidity assay and demonstrated that the small amount of enzyme leaching from the mesh surface contributes to the lytic activity of the lysostaphin-coated samples. Colony counting data from the broth count (model for bacteria in wound fluid) and wash count (model for colonized bacteria) for the enzyme-coated samples showed significantly decreased numbers of CFU compared to uncoated samples (P < 0.05). A pilot in vivo study showed a dose-dependent efficacy of lysostaphin-coated meshes in a rat model of S. aureus infection. The antimicrobial activity of the lysostaphin-coated meshes suggests that such enzyme-leaching surfaces could be efficient at actively resisting initial bacterial adhesion and preventing subsequent colonization of hernia repair meshes.","Satishkumar, Rohan; Sankar, Sriram; Yurko, Yuliya; Lincourt, Amy; Shipp, John; Heniford, B Todd; Vertegel, Alexey",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,30,1

CXCR5+ CD8+ T cell is a novel cell subtype and could possess strong cytotoxic properties in HIV infection. In this study, we investigated the role of CXCR5+ CD8+ T cells in CHB patients. Compared to healthy individuals, both CHB patients and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected hepatocellular carcinoma patients presented significant upregulation of CXCR5+ CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood, in which CXCR5+ CD8+ T cells were negatively correlated with the frequency of CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells in CHB patients. After PMA+ionomycin stimulation, CXCR5+ CD8+ T cells from CHB patients presented significantly higher transcription level of interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin 10 (IL-10), and IL-21, as well as higher IL-10 and IL-21 protein secretion, than CXCR5- CD8+ T cells. Unlike CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells, when incubated with naive CD19+CD27- B cells, CXCR5+ CD8+ T cells alone did not upregulate IgM, IgG, and IgA secretion. However, addition of CXCR5+ CD8+ T cells in B cell-CXCR5+ CD4+ T cell coculture significantly increased the levels of secreted IgG and IgA, demonstrating that CXCR5+ CD8+ T cell could indirectly offer B cell help. Furthermore, high frequencies of CXCR5+ CD8+ T cells tended to associate with low HBV DNA load, and the frequency of CXCR5+ CD8+ T cells was negatively correlated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level. Together, these results suggested that CXCR5+ CD8+ T cells were involved in the antiviral immune responses in CHB and could potentially serve as a therapeutic candidate.","Jiang, Hang; Li, Linhai; Han, Jiang; Sun, Zhiwei; Rong, Yihui; Jin, Yun",DNA and cell biology,30,29

This trial investigated whether computer-assisted cryotherapy (CAC) is effective in reduction of pain and consumption of opioids in patients operated for TKA following an outpatient surgery pathway. METHODS Sixty patients scheduled for primary TKA were included in this prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial receiving CAC at 10-12 °C (Cold-group, n = 30) or at 21 °C (Warm-group, n = 30) during the first 7 days after TKA according to a fixed schedule. All patients received the same pre-, peri- and postoperative care with a multimodal pain protocol. Pain was assessed before and after every session of cryotherapy using the numerical rating scale for pain (NRS-pain). The consumption of opioids was strictly noted during the first 4 postoperative days. Secondary outcomes were knee swelling, visual hematoma and patient reported outcome measures (PROMs). These parameters were measured pre-, 1, 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS In both study groups, a reduction in NRS-pain after every CAC session were seen during the postoperative period of 7 days. A mean reduction of 0.9 and 0.7 on the NRS-pain was seen for respectively the Cold- (P = 0.008) and Warm-group (n.s.). A significant (P = 0.001) lower number of opioids were used by the Cold-group during the acute postoperative phase of 4 days, 47 and 83 tablets for respectively the Cold and Warm-group. No difference could be observed for secondary outcomes and adverse effects between both study groups. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative CAC can be in added value in patients following an outpatient surgery pathway for TKA, resulting in reduced experienced pain and consumption of opioids during the first postoperative days.","Thijs, Elke; Schotanus, Martijn G M; Bemelmans, Yoeri F L; Kort, Nanne P","Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA",30,8

MATERIAL AND METHODS The first 198 consecutive donors (110 cases by expert surgeon and 88 cases by newbie surgeon) operated on using HALDN were included in this study. The primary outcome measures were warm ischemic time (WIT), total operation time and estimated blood loss (EBL). The secondary outcome measures included length of hospital stay (LOS), graft outcome, and surgery-related complications. We used the cumulative sum (CUSUM) method to generate learning curves. RESULTS Except for WIT, all operative and convalescence parameters of donors and graft outcomes were similar for the 2 groups, including the total operation time (174.13 minutes vs. 171.75 minutes, P=0.140), EBL (108.27 cc vs. 116.82 cc, P=0.494), LOS (4.80 days vs. 4.92 days, P=0.144), and overall rates of intraoperative and postoperative complications (P>0.05). A significant difference was observed in WIT between the 2 groups (140.59 sec vs. 106.85 sec, P=0.027). Upon visual assessment of the CUSUM plots, a downward inflexion point for decreasing WIT was observed in 4 cases, total operation time in 12 cases, and EBL in 15 cases. CONCLUSIONS HALDN has a relatively short learning curve and similar results may be expected from newbie urologists who are trained in minimally invasive surgery fellowship.","Tae, Bum Sik; Balpukov, Ulanbek; Kim, Hyeon Hoe; Jeong, Chang Wook",Annals of transplantation,30,25

Laboratory studies investigating office stress have mostly relied on data from participants that were tested individually on abstract tasks. In this study, we examined the effect of psychosocial office stress and work interruptions on the psychobiological stress response in a realistic but controlled group office environment. We also explored the role of cognitive stress appraisal as an underlying mechanism mediating the relationship between work stressors and the stress response. METHODS AND MATERIALS Ninety participants (44 female; mean age 23.11 ± 3.80) were randomly assigned to either a control condition or one of two experimental conditions in which they were exposed to psychosocial stress with or without prior work interruptions in a realistic multi-participant laboratory setting. To induce psychosocial stress, we adapted the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups to an office environment. Throughout the experiment, we continuously monitored heart rate and heart rate variability. Participants repeatedly reported on their current mood, calmness, wakefulness and perceived stress and gave saliva samples to assess changes in salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase. Additionally, cognitive appraisal of the psychosocial stress test was evaluated. RESULTS Our analyses revealed significant group differences for most outcomes during or immediately after the stress test (i.e., mood, calmness, perceived stress, salivary cortisol, heart rate, heart rate variability) and during recovery (i.e., salivary cortisol and heart rate). Interestingly, the condition that experienced work interruptions showed a higher increase of cortisol levels but appraised the stress test as less threatening than individuals that experienced only psychosocial stress. Exploratory mediation analyses revealed a blunted response in subjective measures of stress, which was partially explained by the differences in threat appraisal. DISCUSSION The results showed that experimentally induced work stress led to significant responses of subjective measures of stress, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic nervous system. However, there appears to be a discrepancy between the psychological and biological responses to preceding work interruptions. Appraising psychosocial stress as less threatening but still as challenging could be an adaptive way of coping and reflect a state of engagement and eustress.","Kerr, Jasmine I; Naegelin, Mara; Weibel, Raphael P; Ferrario, Andrea; La Marca, Roberto; von Wangenheim, Florian; Hoelscher, Christoph; Schinazi, Victor R",Psychoneuroendocrinology,30,1

METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study via use of a web-based questionnaire survey of dentists who were affiliated with the Dental Practice-based Research Network Japan (n = 297). To quantify the EPG on MID, we used a questionnaire that included 10 clinical questions or scenarios to assess concordance between dental practice and published evidence on MID. We evaluated concordance by coding responses to each question as consistent or inconsistent with the evidence. An overall concordance was then determined as percent of responses that were consistent with published evidence for 10 questions. Subsequently, multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the associations between dentist characteristics and higher overall concordance (≥median) with published evidence. RESULTS Mean and median overall dentist-level concordance were both 60% (SD: 18, interquartile range: 50-75%). Logistic regression analysis showed that ""gender of dentist"", ""city population"", and ""frequency of obtaining evidence from the scientific journal articles in English"" were significantly associated with high concordance, with odds ratios (95% CIs) of 2.33 (1.01-5.39), 2.01 (1.02-3.96), and 2.45 (1.08-5.59), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Japanese dentists demonstrated medium concordance with published evidence, indicating that an EPG on MID exists in Japanese dental clinical practices. Dentist-specific characteristics had significant associations with high concordance with published evidence. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Despite the establishment and dissemination of the concept of MID, the EPG on MID exists in Japanese dental clinical practices. A high concordance was significantly associated with the following dentist characteristics: ""female dentist"", ""dental clinic location in a government-ordinance-designated city"", and ""frequently obtaining evidence from the English-language scientific journal articles"".","Kakudate, Naoki; Yokoyama, Yoko; Sumida, Futoshi; Matsumoto, Yuki; Yamazaki, Hiroe; Touge, Tomoyuki; Fujikawa, Yuki; Gordan, Valeria V; Gilbert, Gregg H",Journal of dentistry,30,0

This is particularly relevant for organisms restricted to high elevations because they are adapted to cold temperatures and low oxygen availability. Therefore, evaluating trait plasticity of mountain specialists is fundamental to understand their vulnerability to environmental change. We transplanted mountain lizards, Iberolacerta cyreni, 800 m downhill to evaluate the plastic response in body condition, thermoregulation traits, haemoglobin level, and haemoparasite load. Initial measurements of body mass, total haemoglobin concentration ([Hb]), hematic parasite intensities, dorsal luminance, and thermoregulatory behaviour were resampled after two and four weeks of acclimation. We also tested whether an anti-parasitic drug reduced haemoparasite intensity. After only two weeks of acclimation to a lower elevation, lizards decreased 42% in [Hb], had 17% less parasite intensities, increased body condition by 25%, and raised by ~3% their mean preferred temperatures and their voluntary thermal maximum. The anti-parasitic treatment had no significant effect on the intensity of hematic parasites, but our results suggest that negative effects of haemoparasites on [Hb] are relaxed at lower elevation. The rapid plastic changes observed in thermal preferences, body condition, [Hb], and parasite intensity of I. cyreni demonstrate a potential plastic response of a mountain specialist. This may be adaptive under the climatic extremes typical of mountain habitats. However, there is uncertainty in whether the observed plasticity can also help overcome long term environmental changes.","Megía-Palma, R; Jiménez-Robles, O; Hernández-Agüero, J A; De la Riva, I",Journal of thermal biology,30,1

We performed a systematic review and metanalysis aimed to evaluate the pooled incidence of acute HF as a cardiac complication of COVID-19 disease and to estimate the related mortality risk in these patients. METHODS Data were obtained searching MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science for all investigations published any time to 26 December 2020. If statistical heterogeneity was 50%, the results were derived from the fixed-effects model otherwise the random-effects model. RESULTS Overall, 1064 patients [mean age 66 years, 618 males] were included in the final analysis reviewing six investigations. The cumulative in-hospital rate of COVID-19 patients complicated by acute HF ranged between 6.9 and 63.4% among the studies reviewed. A random effect model revealed a pooled incidence of COVID-19 patients complicated by acute HF in 20.2% of cases (95% CI: 11.1-33.9%, p < 0.0001 I2 = 94.4%). A second pooled analysis, based on a random-effect model, confirmed a significant increased risk of death in COVID-19 patients complicated by acute HF during the infection (OR 9.36, 95% CI 4.76-18.4, p < 0.0001, I2 = 56.6%). Meta-regression analysis, using age as moderator variable, failed in founding a statistically significant relationship with the incidence of acute HF onset as a complication of COVID-19 disease (p = 0.062) or the mortality risk among the same subjects (p = 0.053).

Cognitive deficits have been linked to the depletion of dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway, but pharmacological treatments for PD have little evidence of improving or delaying cognitive decline. Therefore, exploring non-pharmacological treatment options is important. There have been some promising results of cognitive training interventions in PD, especially for improvements in working memory and executive functions. Yet, existing studies are often underpowered, lacking appropriate control condition, long term follow-up, a thorough description of the intervention and characteristics of the participants. Working memory updating training has previously shown to increase striatal activation in healthy young and old participants as well as dopaminergic neurotransmission in healthy young participants. In the light of dopamine dysfunction in PD, with negative effects on both motor and cognitive functions it is of interest to study if an impaired striatal system can be responsive to a non-invasive, non-pharmacological intervention. METHODS AND DESIGN The iPARK trial is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial with a parallel-group design that aims to recruit 80 patients with PD (during the period 02/2017-02/2023). Included patients need to have PD, Hoehn and Yahr staging I-III, be between 45 to 75 years of age and not have a diagnosis of dementia. All patients will undergo 30 sessions (6-8 weeks) of web-based cognitive training performed from home. The target intervention is a process-based training program targeting working memory updating. The placebo program is a low dose short-term memory program. A battery of neuropsychological tests and questionnaires will be performed before training, directly after training, and 16 weeks after training. DISCUSSION We expect that the iPARK trial will provide novel and clinically useful information on whether updating training is an effective cognitive training paradigm in PD. Further, it will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of cognitive function in PD and provide answers regarding cognitive plasticity as well as determining critical factors for a responsive striatal system.

Recently, macroscopic self-assemblies based on molecular recognition have been realized using millimeter-scale hydrogel pieces possessing molecular recognition moieties. During the study on macroscopic self-assembly based on molecular recognition, we noticed that the shape of assemblies might be dependent on the host-guest pair. In this study, we were thus motivated to study the macroscopic shape of assemblies formed through host-guest interaction. We modified crosslinked poly(sodium acrylate) microparticles, i.e., superabsorbent polymer (SAP) microparticles, with β-cyclodextrin (βCD) and adamantyl (Ad) residues (βCD(x)-SAP and Ad(y)-SAP microparticles, respectively, where x and y denote the mol% contents of βCD and Ad residues). Then, we studied the self-assembly behavior of βCD(x)-SAP and Ad(y)-SAP microparticles through the complexation of βCD with Ad residues. There was a threshold of the βCD content in βCD(x)-SAP microparticles for assembly formation between x = 22.3 and 26.7. On the other hand, the shape of assemblies was dependent on the Ad content, y; More elongated assemblies were formed at a higher y. This may be because, at a higher y, small clusters formed in an early stage can stick together even upon collisions at a single contact point to form elongated aggregates, whereas, at a smaller y, small clusters stick together only upon collisions at multiple contact points to give rather circular assemblies. On the basis of these observations, the shape of assembly formed from microparticles can be controlled by varying y.","Itami, Takahiro; Hashidzume, Akihito; Kamon, Yuri; Yamaguchi, Hiroyasu; Harada, Akira",Scientific reports,30,5

However, hemorrhagic complications can result. Intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reduces stroke volume and improves behavioral function in experimental stroke models. One suggested therapeutic mechanism is inhibition of vascular endothelial dysfunction. The objective of this study was to determine whether MSCs suppress hemorrhagic events after rtPA therapy in the acute phase of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in rats. METHODS After induction of tMCAO, 4 groups were studied: 1) normal saline [NS]+vehicle, 2) rtPA+vehicle, 3) NS+MSCs, and 4) rtPA+MSCs. The incidence rate of intracerebral hemorrhage, both hemorrhagic and ischemic volume, and behavioral performance were examined. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels in the brain were assessed with zymography. Quantitative analysis of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was performed to assess hemodynamic change in the ischemic lesion. RESULTS The MSC-treated groups (Groups 3 and 4) experienced a greater reduction in the incidence rate of intracerebral hemorrhage and hemorrhagic volume 1 day after tMCAO even if rtPA was received. The application of rtPA enhanced activation of MMP-9, but MSCs inhibited MMP-9 activation. Behavioral testing indicated that both MSC-infused groups had greater improvement than non-MSC groups had, but rtPA+MSCs provided greater improvement than MSCs alone. The rCBF ratio of rtPA groups (Groups 2 and 4) was similar at 2 hours after reperfusion of tMCAO, but both were greater than that in non-rtPA groups. CONCLUSIONS Infused MSCs may inhibit endothelial dysfunction to suppress hemorrhagic events and facilitate functional outcome. Combined therapy of infused MSCs after rtPA therapy facilitated early behavioral recovery.","Nakazaki, Masahito; Sasaki, Masanori; Kataoka-Sasaki, Yuko; Oka, Shinichi; Namioka, Takahiro; Namioka, Ai; Onodera, Rie; Suzuki, Junpei; Sasaki, Yuichi; Nagahama, Hiroshi; Mikami, Takeshi; Wanibuchi, Masahiko; Kocsis, Jeffery D; Honmou, Osamu",Journal of neurosurgery,30,31

Goal planning identifies priorities for treatment through discussion and negotiation between service users and health practitioners. Goal planning enhances motivation, directs effort, and focuses the development of strategies and treatment options to improve recovery outcomes and promote service users' ownership of the recovery process. While goal planning is a common practice in mental health settings, evidence regarding its impact on treatment outcomes is lacking. This paper outlines a protocol for a systematic review that aims to explore the types of goals planned, experiences of service users and practitioners, and the effectiveness of goal planning as a mental health intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic search will be conducted during March 2021 by searching Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus and PsycINFO electronic databases to answer the following questions: (1) What types of goals are being developed within mental healthcare?; (2) What is the evidence for the effectiveness of goal planning on health and well-being for mental health service users?; (3) What are the experiences of mental health service users and their treating healthcare practitioners in relation to goal planning?; and (4) What are the barriers and facilitators to effective goal planning in mental health settings? Two independent researchers will screen the articles, selecting literature that meets criteria. All literature, regardless of study design that involves adult participants, with a mental illness and reporting on goal planning will be considered for inclusion. Data will be extracted from all eligible articles regardless of study design and summarised in a table.

Multimodality treatment approaches are commonplace, and selective ophthalmic artery chemosurgery has emerged as a safe and effective treatment in selected patients. Minimizing radiation dose in this highly radiosensitive patient cohort is critical. We explore which procedural factors affect the radiation dose in a single-center cohort of children managed in the UK National Retinoblastoma Service. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was performed of 177 selective ophthalmic artery chemosurgery procedures in 48 patients with retinoblastoma (2013-2017). Medical records, angiographic imaging, and radiation dosimetry data (including total fluoroscopic screening time, skin dose, and dose-area product) were reviewed. RESULTS The mean fluoroscopic time was 13.5 ± 13 minutes, the mean dose-area product was 11.7 ± 9.7 Gy.cm2, and the mean total skin dose was 260.9 ± 211.6 mGy. One hundred sixty-three of 177 procedures (92.1%) were technically successful. In 14 (7.9%), the initial attempt was unsuccessful (successful in 13/14 re-attempts). Screening time and radiation dose were associated with drug-delivery microcatheter location and patient age; screening time was associated with treatment cycle. CONCLUSIONS In selective ophthalmic artery chemosurgery, a microcatheter tip position in the proximal or ostial ophthalmic artery and patient age 2 years or younger were associated with reduced fluoroscopic screening time and radiation dose; treatment beyond the first cycle was associated with reduced fluoroscopic screening time.","Qureshi, A M; Davies, L K; Patel, P A; Rennie, A; Robertson, F",AJNR.

Although 90-day prescriptions may benefit patients, they are potentially dangerous for those at risk for suicide. Prior authorization requirements by some insurers for coverage of shorter prescriptions and some pharmacists' newfound ability to unilaterally convert 30-day prescriptions with refills into 90-day supplies have complicated physicians' efforts to prevent harm to these patients.

They are likely to cross sector, community, local, and national interests and, in so doing, require alternative governance arrangements that are responsive and sustainable. This article focuses on the process of forging such governance processes drawing on a case study characterized by complex cross-sector demands. The subject of the case study is a paradigm-breaking primary health and well-being initiative for a region of New Zealand with longstanding healthcare challenges, but contemporary possibilities. We were invited by the creators of this initiative to record and reflect on the challenges and successes and, from this, to identify what might be possible for future innovations. In doing so, we draw on the adaptive governance literature to frame the governance challenges and offer five paradoxes requiring collective navigation. We conclude with a series of recommendations on how such paradoxes are navigated for those needing to build governance practice in innovative social purpose initiatives and recognize the importance of engaging with indigenous scholarship in future analyses.","Carroll, Brigid Jan; Fouche, Christa; Curtin, Jennifer",Frontiers in psychology,30,9

We report that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1, which activates the small GTPase Arf1 to induce COPI transport processes, is required for rotavirus replication since knocking down GBF1 expression by RNA interference, or inhibiting its activity by treatment with Brefeldin A (BFA) or Golgicide A (GCA) significantly reduce the yield of infectious viral progeny. This reduction in virus yield was related to a block in virus assembly since in the presence of either BFA or GCA the assembly of infectious mature triple-layered virions was significantly prevented and only doubled layered-particles were detected. We report that the catalytic activity of GBF1, but not the activation of Arf1, is essential for the assembly of the outer capsid of rotavirus. We show that both BFA and GCA, as well as interfering with the synthesis of GBF1, alter the electrophoretic mobility of glycoproteins VP7 and NSP4 and block the trimerization of the virus surface VP7, a step required for its incorporation into virus particles. Although a post-translational modification of VP7 (other than glycosylation) could be related to the lack of trimerization, we found that NSP4 might also be involved in this process, since knocking-down its expression reduces VP7 trimerizarion. In support, recombinant VP7 protein overexpressed in transfected cells formed trimers only when co-transfected with NSP4.IMPORTANCERotavirus, a member of the family Reoviridae, is the major cause of severe diarrhea in children and young animals worldwide. Despite the significant advances in the characterization of the biology of this virus, the mechanisms involved in morphogenesis of the virus particle are still poorly understood. In this work, we show that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1, relevant for the COPI/Arf1-mediated cellular vesicular transport, participates in the replication cycle of the virus, influencing the correct processing of viral glycoproteins VP7 and NSP4, and the assembly of the virus surface proteins VP7 and VP4.","Martínez, José L; Arnoldi, Francesca; Schraner, Elisabeth M; Eichwald, Catherine; Silva-Ayala, Daniela; Lee, Eunjoo; Sztul, Elizabeth; Burrone, Óscar R; López, Susana; Arias, Carlos F",Journal of virology,30,33

This study investigated the feasibility and acceptability of using liraglutide 3.0 mg daily to address this problem. MATERIALS AND METHODS Design Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled pilot trial. Setting Mental health centres and primary care within Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust. Participants Adults with schizophrenia, schizoaffective, or first-episode psychosis prescribed antipsychotic medication who were overweight or obese. Intervention Once daily subcutaneous liraglutide or placebo, titrated to 3.0 mg daily, for 6 months. Primary outcome recruitment, consent, retention and adherence. Secondary exploratory outcomes weight, HbA1c and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. RESULTS 799 individuals were screened for eligibility. The commonest reasons for exclusion were ineligibility (44%) and inability to make contact (28%). The acceptance rate, as a proportion of all eligible participants, was 12.2%. The commonest stated reason why eligible candidates declined to participate related to the study specific medication and protocol (n= 50). 47 participants were randomised with 79% completing the trial. Participants in the liraglutide arm had lost a mean 5.7±7.9 kg compared with no significant weight change in the placebo group (treatment difference -6.0 kg, p=0.015).

The aim of this study was to report a multistep oral rehabilitation of severe atrophic maxilla by means of Le Fort I osteotomy for maxillary downward and forward repositioning, allografts, implant insertion, and prosthetic loading. METHODS Patients with severe maxillary atrophy underwent Le Fort I osteotomy associated to fresh-frozen interpositional bone allografts. At 7 months after reconstructive procedure, 2 biopsies for each patient have been taken, and in the same surgical procedure, endosseous implants were placed. Five months afterward, abutments were connected for the final prosthodontic restauration. Each patient was evaluated at 1-year follow-up after prosthetic loading. RESULTS At 1-year follow-up after functional prosthetic loading, no infection of the allografts or implant failure has been reported. Clinical and radiologic follow-up showed no sign of bone resorption in all the osteotomic sites and in the grafted areas. Histological analysis showed evidence of allograft osteointegration and healing. CONCLUSIONS Multistep oral rehabilitation of severe atrophic maxilla with Le Fort and interpositional bone allografts represents a reliable surgical technique. According to this clinical, radiologic, and histologic reports, interpositional fresh-frozen bone allograft seems to be a valuable material for grafting jaw as it is cheaper than other materials and is safe, and it avoids donor site, decreasing the morbidity of the treatment","Nocini, Pier Francesco; Bertossi, Dario; Albanese, Massimo; D'Agostino, Antonio; Chilosi, Massimo; Procacci, Pasquale",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,30,1

Fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) and FUT3 genes are related to IBD. This study aimed to investigate whether these genes correlated with the susceptibility to AS. Questionnaires of 673 patients with AS, and peripheral blood specimens of the patients and 687 healthy controls were collected. FUT2 and FUT3 genes were genotyped using the SNPscan method. Frequency differences of the genes at different levels, haplotypes, and interactions were analyzed. No frequency differences were found between the cases and the controls in all the genotypes and the alleles of rs1047781, rs1800028, rs1800030, and rs812936. For rs28362459, a significant difference in allele frequencies was observed in the total participants between the groups [χ2 = 7.515, Pcorrected = 0.030; adjusted odds ratio (ORadjusted)G/T = 0.782; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.650-0.941].

In the case of coronaviruses, the interaction with surfaces (including the skin surface) is mediated by their large glycoprotein spikes that protrude from (and cover) the viral envelope. Here, we perform all atomic simulations between the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and human skin models. We consider an “oily” skin covered by sebum and a “clean” skin exposing the stratum corneum. The simulations show that the spike tries to maximize the contacts with stratum corneum lipids, particularly ceramides, with substantial hydrogen bonding. In the case of “oily” skin, the spike is able to retain its structure, orientation and hydration over sebum with little interaction with sebum components. Comparison of these results with our previous simulations of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike with hydrophilic and hydrophobic solid surfaces, suggests that the”soft” or “hard” nature of the surface plays an essential role in the interaction of the spike protein with materials.","Domingo, Marc; Faraudo, Jordi",bioRxiv,30,10

As part of the response plans, many countries have been attempting to restrict people’s mobility by launching social distancing protocol, including in Indonesia. It is then necessary to identify the campaign’s impact and analyze the influence of mobility patterns on the pandemic’s transmission rate. Objective: Using mobility data from Google and Apple, this research discovers that COVID-19 daily new cases in Indonesia are mostly related to the mobility trends in the previous eight days. Methods: We generate ten-day predictions of COVID-19 daily new cases and Indonesians’ mobility by using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm to provide insight for future implementation of social distancing policies. Results: We found that all eight-mobility categories result in the highest accumulation correlation values between COVID-19 daily new cases and the mobility eight days before.

This study examined the relationship between housing construction costs and house rents fluctuations in Osogbo, Nigeria, to provide information for informed investment decisions.Design/methodology/approachThe authors conducted a survey, where three sets of questionnaires were administered on building contractors;estate surveyors and valuers and private residential property owners. The data required comprise the estimated average construction costs and average market rents for two and three-bedroom bungalows in the study area from 2008 to 2018. These data were respectively sourced from all the 15 firms of building contractors and 25 firms of estate surveyors and valuers in Osogbo, Nigeria. Stratified random sampling was employed to select 180 property owners from three medium-density residential districts of Osogbo. Secondary data on macroeconomic variables were sourced from the Central Bank of Nigeria. Data collected were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical tools.FindingsThe authors found a significant positive relationship (0.749) between construction costs and house rents trends;both variables maintained ascending trends. Construction costs and house rents inflation rates exhibited random fluctuations with the former having a higher mean inflation rate (10.47%). However, the difference was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.317 &gt; 0.05). Respondents identified consumer price index (CPI) inflation among other macroeconomic variables as the strongest predictor of both construction costs and house rents fluctuations. However, evidence from further analysis of the time series suggested otherwise.Practical implicationsThe result confirms construction cost as one of the vital supply factors of the housing market, which is often pass through to house rents. The positive relationship between construction costs and house rents trends should trigger new development which, will, in turn, allow rental housing investments to expand into new areas with prospects for profits that could be earned by domestic and foreign investors.Originality/valueThis study to the best knowledge of the researchers is the first to relate housing construction cost to house rent in Osogbo, Nigeria;thereby adding to the body of knowledge in this field.","Chiwuzie, Augustina Daniel Ibrahim Dabara",Property Management,30,1

Most NDCs include targets to mitigate national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which need quantifications to assess i.a. whether the current NDCs collectively put us on track to reach the PA temperature goals or the gap in ambition to do so. We implemented the new open-source tool “NDCmitiQ” to quantify GHG mitigation targets defined in the NDCs for all countries with quantifiable targets on a disaggregated level and to create corresponding national and global emissions pathways. In light of the 5-year update cycle of NDCs and the global stocktake, the quantification of NDCs is an ongoing task for which NDCmitiQ can be used, as calculations can easily be updated upon submission of new NDCs. In this paper, we describe the methodologies behind NDCmitiQ and quantification challenges we encountered by addressing a wide range of aspects, including target types and the input data from within NDCs;external time series of national emissions, population, and GDP;uniform approach vs. country specifics;share of national emissions covered by NDCs;how to deal with the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) component and the conditionality of pledges;and establishing pathways from single-year targets. For use in NDCmitiQ, we furthermore construct an emissions data set from the baseline emissions provided in the NDCs. Example use cases show how the tool can help to analyse targets on a national, regional, or global scale and to quantify uncertainties caused by a lack of clarity in the NDCs. Results confirm that the conditionality of targets and assumptions about economic growth dominate uncertainty in mitigated emissions on a global scale, which are estimated as 48.9–56.1 Gt CO2eq.

Material and Methods: In this study, which was planned as a cross-sectional analytical study, individuals were reached through social media using the snow-ball sampling method. Health Perception Scale (HPS), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was applied. The study was completed with 440 people. Result: As the level of education increased, health perception scores also increased (p=0.049). There was a significant relationship between regular nutrition, exercise and self-devotion and perception of health (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001, p=0.001). The total score of DASS was found to be statistically significantly higher in participants with COVID disease in the first degree (p=0.044). DASS depression subscale scores were statistically higher in singles than married. PSS levels were higher in the participants under the age of 40 (p=0.002), in women (p&lt;0.001), in singles (p&lt;0.001) and in those who did not have children (p&lt;0.001). Discussion: In this study, during the COVID-19 outbreak in the society, it was found that the participants had high levels of depression, anxiety and stress and low perception of health. Priority might therefore be attached to these in future psychiatric planning.

Based on the traditional vehicle routing problem, this paper considers the sharing economy and open-loop distribution reality hotspots and considers the optimization of carbon emissions in contactless distribution. The travel distance and load capacity are the key factors affecting carbon emissions. The carbon emission model proposes dual goals of minimizing distribution costs and carbon emissions. It constructs a distribution path planning model with multiple distribution stations. To solve this problem with multidepot optimization, we design a hybrid genetic algorithm, and according to the strategy of customer distance clustering analysis, the dispatching of vehicles is divided into three steps. The principle of elite crossing is applied to avoid the solution to fall into local optimum. The experimental results show that the proposed model and optimization algorithm can get a tradeoff between the logistics cost and carbon emissions.","Li, Huilin Xiong Ke Xie Xiuming",Mathematical Problems in Engineering,30,24

The literature agrees that COVID-19 is likely to have long-term mental health effects on infected individuals, which signifies a need to understand the role of the virus in the pathophysiology of brain disorders that is currently unknown and widely debated. Our docking and molecular dynamic simulations show that the affinity of the spike protein from the wild type (WT) and the South African B.1.351 (SA) variant towards the MAO enzymes is comparable to that for its ACE2 receptor. This allows for the WT/SA…MAO complex formation, which changes MAO affinities for their neurotransmitter substrates, thus consequently impacting the rates of their metabolic conversion and misbalancing their levels. Knowing that this fine regulation is strongly linked with the etiology of various brain pathologies, these results are the first to highlight the possibility that the interference with the brain MAO catalytic activity is responsible for the increased neurodegenerative illnesses following a COVID-19 infection, thus placing a neurobiological link between these two conditions in the spotlight. Since the obtained insight suggests that a more contagious SA variant causes even larger disturbances, and with new and more problematic strains likely emerging in the near future, we firmly advise that the presented prospect of the SARS-CoV-2 induced neurological complications should not be ignored, but rather requires further clinical investigations to achieve an early diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions.

O3 is a secondary pollutant with adverse effects on population health and ecosystems and with negative impacts on climate, acting as greenhouse gas. Most of these studies focused on spring 2020 (i.e. March–May) and on observations in the planetary boundary layer (PBL), mostly in the vicinity of urban agglomerates. Here, we analyzed the variability of O3 above the PBL of northern Italy in 2020 by using continuous observations carried out at a high mountain WMO/GAW global station in Italy (Mt. Cimone–CMN;44°12′ N, 10°42′ E, 2165 m a.s.l.). Low O3 monthly anomalies were observed during spring (MAM) and summer (JJA), when periods of low O3 intertwined with periods with higher O3, within climatological ranges. A similar variability was observed for O3 precursors like NO2 and 15 anthropogenic non-methane volatile organic carbons, but the systematic O3 anomalies were not reflected in these variables. The analysis of meteorological variables and diel O3 cycles did not suggest major changes in the vertical transport related to the thermal circulation system in the mountain area. The analysis of five days back-trajectories suggested that the observed O3 anomalies cannot be explained by differences in the synoptic-scale circulation with respect to the previous years alone. On the other hand, the characterization of two transport patterns (i.e. air masses from the regional PBL or from the free troposphere) and the analysis of back-trajectories suggested an important contribution of transport from the continental PBL during the periods with the lowest O3 at CMN. When proxies of air mass transport from the regional PBL are considered, a lower NO x content was pointed out with respect to the previous years, suggesting a lower O3 production in a NO x -limited atmosphere. Our study suggested for the first time that, during MAM and JJA 2020, the reduced anthropogenic emissions related to the COVID-19 restrictions lowered the amount of this short-lived climate forcer/pollutant at remote locations above the PBL over northern Italy. This work suggests the importance of limiting anthropogenic precursor emissions for decreasing the O3 amount at remote locations and in upper atmospheric layers.","Cristofanelli, Paolo Arduni Jgor Serva Federico Calzolari Francescopiero Bonasoni Paolo Busetto Maurizio Maione Michela Sprenger Michael Trisolino Pamela Putero Davide",Environmental Research Letters,30,16

Such feedback can also fuel social-based ranking algorithms and recommendation systems. However, while educational users appreciate the recommendations made by other teachers, they are not highly motivated to provide such feedback by themselves. This situation is common in many consumer applications that rely on users’ opinions for personalisation. A possible solution that was successfully applied in several other domains to incentivise active participation is gamification. This paper describes for the first time the application of a comprehensive cutting-edge gamification taxonomy, in a user-centred participatory-design process of an OER system for Physics, PeTeL, used throughout Israel. Physics teachers were first involved in designing gamification features based on their preferences, helping shape the gamification mechanisms likely to enhance their motivation to provide reviews. The results informed directly the implementation of two gamification elements that were implemented in the learning environment, with a second experiment evaluating their actual effect on teachers’ behaviour. After a long-term, real-life pilot of two months, teachers’ response rate was measured and compared to the prior state. The results showed a statistically significant effect, with a 4X increase in the total amount of recommendations per month, even when taking into account the ‘Covid-pandemic effect’. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Yacobson, E.; Toda, A.; Cristea, A.

This is an innovative vaccination approach employing a DNA vector expressing a mutated HIV-1 Nef protein (Nefmut) that has lost the anti-cellular effects typical of the wild-type isoform, meanwhile showing an unusual efficiency of incorporation into EVs. This function persists even when foreign antigens are fused to its C-terminus. In this way, Nefmut traffics large amounts of antigens fused to it into EVs spontaneously released by cells expressing the Nefmut_based DNA vector. We previously provided evidence that the inoculation in mice of a DNA vector expressing the Nefmut/HPV16-E7 fusion protein induced an E7-specific CTL immune response as detected 2 weeks after the second immunization. In an effort to optimize the anti-HPV16 CD8+ T cell immune response, we found that the co-injection of DNA vectors expressing Nefmut fused with E6 and E7 generated a stronger anti-HPV16 immune response compared to that we observed in mice injected with the single vectors. When TC-1 cells, i.e., a tumor cell line co-expressing E6 and E7, were implanted before immunization, all mice survived until day 44, whereas no mice injected with either void or Nefmut_expressing vectors survived until day 32 after tumor implantation. A substantial part of mice (7 out of 12) cleared the tumor. When cured mice were re-challenged with a second sub cute implantation of TC-1 cells, and followed for additional 135 days, whereas none of them developed tumors. Both E6- and E7-specific CD8+ T immunity was still detectable at the end of the observation time. Hence, the immunity elicited by engineered EVs, besides curing already developed tumors, is strong enough to guarantee the resistance to additional tumor attack. This results is of relevance for therapy against both metastatic and relapsing tumors.","Ferrantelli, Flavia; Manfredi, Francesco; Chiozzini, Chiara; Olivetta, Eleonora; Giovannelli, Andrea; Leone, Patrizia; Federico, Maurizio",bioRxiv,30,20

As of March 2021, there have been over 830,000 cases of COVID-19 and 24,000 mortalities in New Jersey (NJ). Our study aimed to identify the point prevalence of PTSD and sub-threshold PTSD in HCWs across NJ during the second wave of the pandemic. Methods: We conducted a prospective survey study that was distributed electronically to physicians (attendings, fellows, and residents) and mid-level practitioners (MLPs) working in emergency departments across NJ from December 2020 – March 2021 using a secure, online survey platform. Results: All collected participant demographics are shown by training level in Table 1. There are several provisional diagnostic determinations of PTSD currently in use (Table 2). For continuous total severity score, the mean score and standard deviation (SD) for attending physicians was 13.9 (12.6), for resident/fellow physicians it was 15.4 (18.2), and for MLPs it was 20.4 (14.9), causing a statistically significant difference between the groups (p=0.01). Following the DSM-5 criteria, a total of 27 individuals were diagnosed with PTSD, where a significantly high proportion of those were MLPs (n (%) = 20 (25);p=0.02). DSM-5 criteria B-E (Table 2) is used to evaluate subthreshold PTSD. Regardless of whether two or three criteria were used for diagnosis, the proportion met was greatest for the MLPs, with criterion D being significantly associated with training level (p=0.01). Discussion: Physician burnout is well documented in the U.S. Current second-year emergency medicine residents had the highest contiguous severity score, most likely because their intern year was completely consumed by the COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic put a dent in the movement for physician wellness. Attending physicians in teaching hospitals are responsible for, in addition to patient care, the training of residents. The burden of navigating a mentorship role while managing the high volume of critical ill patients suffering from a novel disease can't be ignored. MLPs, along with their physician colleagues, experienced shortages in PPE, redeployment into other subspecialists, furlough and/or termination from their positions, and COVID morbidity. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant psychological trauma for HCWs. Regardless of training level, physicians and mid-level practitioners report symptoms suggestive of PTSD and sub-PTSD. MLPs were particularly affected by the trauma of the novel coronavirus and more research must be done to fully elucidate why this particular group of providers has been so negatively impacted.

In this paper, we explore the use of 3D printing in mass customization (MC) programs. We consider the case when 3D printing brings extra self-design fun to consumers, which is highlighted in MC practices of the auto company BMW and the furniture company Poltrona Frau, and also changes the cost formula (i.e., the marginal product variety cost) of the MC product. In addition, the roles played by the risk attitudes of the MC manufacturer and consumers, consumer returns, as well as consumers’ time sensitive behaviors, are also uncovered. We find that under the case with a low consumer's willingness to pay for the traditional “ready-made product variety enjoyment” (RPVE), even the maximized product variety level and the additional self-design fun cannot make the 3D printing based MC more profitable. In addition, compared to the markets with risk-averse and risk-neutral consumers, the 3D printing based MC can increase more MRBs and a higher consumer surplus by simultaneously highlighting the high self-design fun and the high RPVE in a market with risk-seeking consumers. The high flexibility and responsiveness of 3D printing also shows its advantages in remanufacturing the consumer returned MC items and enhancing MC programs’ overall lead-time. Finally, applying 3D printing in creating molds can also help the MC manufacturer tackle demand uncertainties. These findings all provide a good reference to the application of 3D printing in MC operations.","Guo, Shu Choi Tsan-Ming Chung Sai-Ho",European Journal of Operational Research,30,1

A smartphone-based software can automate interpretation of an LFA kit, but such algorithms typically require a very large number of images of assays tested with validated specimens, which is challenging to collect for different assay kits, especially for those released during a pandemic. Here, we present an approach - AutoAdapt LFA - that uses few-shot learning, an approach used in other applications such as computer vision and robotics, for accurate and automated interpretation of LFA kits that requires a small number of validated images for training. The approach consists of three components: extraction of membrane and zone areas from an image of the LFA kit, a self-supervised encoder that employs a feature extractor trained with edge-filtered patterns, and few-shot adaptation that enables generalization to new kits using limited validated images. From a base model pre-trained on a commercial LFA kit, we demonstrated the ability of adapted models to interpret results from five new COVID-19 LFA kits (three detecting antigens for diagnosing active infection, and two detecting antibodies for diagnosing past infection). Specifically, using just 10 to 20 images of each new kit, we achieved accuracies of 99% to 100% for each kit. The server-hosted algorithm has an execution time of approximately 4 seconds, which can potentially enable quality assurance and linkage to care for users operating new LFAs in decentralized settings.","Arumugam, S.; Ma, J.; Macar, U.; Han, G.; McAulay, K.

Patient stressors can interfere with their ability to make reasoned and timely decisions about survivorship care and lead to poor quality of life and low physical and social functioning. This pilot effectiveness-implementation study examined the impact and feasibility of offering the Bright IDEAS system of Problem-Solving Skills Training (PSST) to adult cancer survivors to help them and their caregivers cope more successfully with decision making and distress. Methods: Patients with breast (21), prostate (9) or colorectal (20) cancer who completed their definitive cancer treatment within the last 6 months and had their cancer survivorship visit were recruited from two regional cancer centers and affiliated community oncology clinics. Patients with an NCCN distress level &gt; 2 were randomly assigned to either care as usual (CAU) or 8 weekly PSST sessions provided by a trained therapist in person or remotely. Patients were invited but not required to include a supportive other (n = 17). Patient and caregiver assessments at baseline (T1), end of intervention/3 months (T2), and 3 months post intervention/6 months (T3) focused on problem-solving skills (SPSI-25), distress (HADS) and quality of life (FACT). We also collected healthcare utilization data. We compared outcome changes T1-T2 and T1-T3, by study arm, using t-tests. Multivariate regression analysis identified subgroups of patients with positive and negative responses to skills training. Results: Average age of the participants was 63 years (45 to 87) with racial and ethnic distributions representative of the local population (88% white). Two thirds were women (n = 32), one third of the patients were recruited and received therapy fully remotely due to COVID-19-related protocol changes. Patients who received PSST reported a reduction in dysfunctional problemsolving style and improvement in constructive style while problem-solving skills of CAU patients trended in the opposite direction. Patients in the PSST arm also reported significant reduction in anxiety and depression and improvement in cancer-specific quality of life (p &lt; 0.05) that was sustained at 6 months. Patients in the PSST arm reported lower use of hospital and ED services compared to CAU patients (p = 0.07). Better improvement in outcomes was driven by lower problem-solving skills at baseline. Conclusions:Despite the logistical complexity of running a clinical trial during quarantine, patients and caregivers in the PSST arm demonstrated meaningful improvement in distress and quality of life. The evidence from this pilot study will help guide development of a future multi-site randomized clinical trial of the effect of PSST on cancer survivorship care and outcomes.","Noyes, K.; Sahler, O.

Therefore, compliance solutions, whether passive or active, are necessary. In this regard, series elastic actuators (SEAs) have attracted extensive interest for applications in industrial robotics owing to the low output impedance of these actuators, which can enhance interaction safety. Although considerable efforts have been expended to improve the control accuracy of SEAs, the time delay in impedance/admittance control has remained an unexplored problem. The use of filters in conventional methods can result in large time delay and considerable amplitude errors that degrade the performance and increase the risk of injury. This study resolves this problem by developing a method for low-delay admittance control of hydraulic SEAs. An external force observer (EFO)-based admittance scheme is first formulated. Thereafter, adaptive time series (ATS) compensators are introduced to improve position control and EFO. Based on the improved position controller and the ATS-based EFO (ATS-EFO), a novel low-delay admittance control scheme is developed. The proposed method only uses the load mass and spring stiffness information, thereby facilitating its application. Simulation experiments are performed to demonstrate the SEA control performance on position tracking, external force estimation, and stiffness tracking. The results confirm that the time delay and the amplitude error in these tests are significantly reduced by the proposed method.","Zhong, Haoran; Li, Peigen; Gao, Liang; Li, Xinyu",Procedia Manufacturing,30,28

Yet, never has this problem been tackled by digging into data with ad hoc analysis techniques. Here we show that the emergence of variants can in fact be traced through data-driven methods, further capitalizing on the value of large collections of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. For all countries with sufficient data, we compute weekly counts of amino acid changes, unveil time-varying clusters of changes with similar – rapidly growing – dynamics, and then follow their evolution. Our method succeeds in timely associating clusters to variants of interest/concern, provided their change composition is well characterized. This allows us to detect variants’ emergence, rise, peak, and eventual decline under competitive pressure of another variant. Our early warning system, exclusively relying on deposited sequences, shows the power of big data in this context, and concurs to calling for the wide spreading of public SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing for improved surveillance and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bernasconi, Anna; Mari, Lorenzo; Casagrandi, Renato; Ceri, Stefano",bioRxiv,30,1

OBJECTIVE The aim of this article is to provide guidance on common issues pertaining to bariatric-metabolic surgery that general practitioners (GPs) face, including patient selection, preoperative work-up, acute and long-term complications following the surgery, and long-term lifestyle and nutritional support. DISCUSSION In properly selected patients with clinically severe obesity, there is clear net benefit in terms of improved health outcomes and reduced mortality following bariatric-metabolic surgery. Similarly to other chronic conditions, GPs play a crucial role in the management of obesity, and in the multidisciplinary, long-term postoperative support and monitoring that is important for optimal outcomes after surgery.","Lee, Phong Ching; Dixon, John",Australian family physician,30,33

Notably, HCoV-NL63 infections were significantly more common among children hospitalised in 2006/2007 (1.2%) than in 2005/2006 (0.3%).3. The peak season for HCoVNL63 infection was autumn(September to October). 4. HCoV-NL63 infection was associated with younger age,croup, febrile convulsion, and acute gastroenteritis. Such disease associations were not found with the other three HCoVs. 5. Most local HCoV-NL63 isolates were closely related to the prototype strain in Netherlands(NL496), but a few were phylogenetically distinct from the major cluster.","Leung, T F; Chan, P K S; Wong, W K G; Ip, M; Cheng, W T F; Ng, P C",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,30,1

Thus, ONYX-015 was conceived as an oncolytic virus that would selectively replicate in p53-defective tumor cells. Here we show that loss of E1B-55K leads to the induction, but not the activation, of p53 in ONYX-015-infected primary cells. We use a novel adenovirus mutant, ONYX-053, to demonstrate that loss of E1B-55K-mediated late viral RNA export, rather than p53 degradation, restricts ONYX-015 replication in primary cells. In contrast, we show that tumor cells that support ONYX-015 replication provide the RNA export function of E1B-55K. These data reveal that tumor cells have altered mechanisms for RNA export and resolve the controversial role of p53 in governing ONYX-015 oncolytic selectivity.","O'Shea, Clodagh C; Johnson, Leisa; Bagus, Bridget; Choi, Serah; Nicholas, Cory; Shen, Annie; Boyle, Larry; Pandey, Kusum; Soria, Conrado; Kunich, John; Shen, Yuqiao; Habets, Gaston; Ginzinger, Dave; McCormick, Frank",Cancer cell,30,2

Budding of flavivirus membranes is driven by the viral transmembrane proteins prM and E independently of NC interaction. We show that control of signalase cleavage of the multimembrane-spanning flavivirus polyprotein by the catalytic function of the viral protease is critical for efficient virus morphogenesis. In wild-type virus, signalase cleavage of prM remains inefficient until cleavage of capsid at the cytosolic side of the signal sequence separating the two proteins has occurred. This obligatory sequence of cleavages was uncoupled in a mutant virus with the consequence of greatly reduced incorporation of NC into budding membranes and augmented release of NC-free virus-like particles. Efficient signalase cleavage of prM in the mutant virus resulted in partial inhibition of cleavage of capsid by the viral NS2B-3 protease. Our results support a model for flavivirus morphogenesis involving temporal and spatial coordination of NC assembly and envelopment by regulated cleavages of an ER membrane-spanning capsid-prM intermediate.","Lobigs, Mario; Lee, Eva",Journal of virology,30,1

Nasal encephaloceles were always identified as complex masses of mixed soft tissue and CSF intensity that were contiguous with intracranial structures. The nasal glioma appeared as a mixed-intensity mass that, on the basis of the CT scan, appeared to be continuous with intracranial structures. Nasal dermal sinuses could only be identified as they coursed through the skin and subcutaneous soft tissue. They could not be identified when intraosseous. Moreover, on CT and, particularly, on MR, a number of potential diagnostic pitfalls were encountered. The most important of these was the normal fat deposition that occurs within bone during normal maturation and during aeration of the frontal sinuses and nasal bones. These fatty changes can easily be mistaken for fatty tumors if they are not recognized as normal anatomic changes. Interestingly, the classic plain film findings for congenital nasal masses were present only in the encephaloceles and nasal glioma; dermoids and dermal sinuses showed none of the classic plain film findings. In the six patients who had both CT and MR, the masses were easily identified and characterized by each imaging method. Congenital nasal masses are well characterized by both CT and MR. It is important to understand the normal changes in the anatomy of the nasofrontal region in the pediatric age group to avoid false-positive diagnoses in this region.","Barkovich, A J; Vandermarck, P; Edwards, M S; Cogen, P H",AJNR.

EAV uses a discontinuous transcription mechanism to produce a nested set of six subgenomic mRNAs from which its structural genes are expressed. We have generated the first documented arterivirus defective interfering (DI) RNAs by serial undiluted passaging of a wild-type EAV stock in BHK-21 cells. A cDNA copy of the smallest DI RNA (5.6 kb) was cloned. Upon transfection into EAV-infected BHK-21 cells, transcripts derived from this clone (pEDI) were replicated and packaged. Sequencing of pEDI revealed that the DI RNA was composed of three segments of the EAV genome (nucleotides 1 to 1057, 1388 to 1684, and 8530 to 12704) which were fused in frame with respect to the replicase reading frame. Remarkably, this DI RNA has retained all of the sequences encoding the structural proteins. By insertion of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in the DI RNA genome, we were able to delimitate the sequences required for replication/DI-based transcription and packaging of EAV DI RNAs and to reduce the maximal size of a replication-competent EAV DI RNA to approximately 3 kb.","Molenkamp, R; Rozier, B C; Greve, S; Spaan, W J; Snijder, E J",Journal of virology,30,28

METHODS The prevalence of infectious COVID-19 cases by country was multiplied by expected monthly passenger volumes to predict the rate of arrivals. The rate of undetected infections entering the border following screening and quarantine was estimated. Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 countries were defined as those with an active COVID-19 prevalence of up to 1/105, 10/105 and 100/105, respectively. RESULTS With 65,272 travellers per month, the number of undetected COVID-19 infections exiting quarantine is 1 every 45, 15 and 31 months for Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 countries, respectively. The overall rate of undetected active COVID-19 infections exiting quarantine is expected to increase from the current 0.40 to 0.50 per month, or an increase of one extra infection every 10 months. CONCLUSIONS Loosening border restrictions results in a small increase in the rate of undetected COVID-19 infections exiting quarantine, which increases from the current baseline by one infection every 10 months. This information may be useful in guiding decision-making on selectively opening of borders in the COVID-19 era.","Smith, Benjamin J; Morris, Arthur J; Johnston, Ben; Child, Stephen; Thornley, Simon",The New Zealand medical journal,30,12

At the end of 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread throughout China and other countries around the world, resulting in a viral pandemic. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the correlation between ferritin and disease severity in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS In this cross-sectional study, we obtained clinical and laboratory data regarding 39 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 from two hospitals in Israel. RESULTS A significant increase in ferritin levels was demonstrated in patients with moderate and severe disease, compared to patients with mild disease (P = 0.006 and 0.005, respectively). Severe patients had significantly higher levels of ferritin (2817.6 ng/ml) than non-severe patients (708.6 ng/ml) P = 0.02. CONCLUSIONS In this preliminary cross-sectional study, elevated ferritin levels were shown to correlate with disease severity in 39 patients from Israel with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Our results further strengthen the hypothesis that severe COVID-19 disease might be due to an underlying dysregulated hyperimmune response. In order to identify these patients early and prioritized resources, we believe that all patients with COVID-19 should be screened for hyperferritinemia.","Dahan, Shani; Segal, Gad; Katz, Itai; Hellou, Tamar; Tietel, Michal; Bryk, Gabriel; Amital, Howard; Shoenfeld, Yehuda; Dagan, Amir",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,30,22

In this explorative study, the pathogen-inactivating capacity of UVC irradiation in platelet (PLT) concentrates was investigated. The dose dependencies of inactivation of several viruses and bacteria were compared with the effect on PLT quality. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The potential of UVC irradiation was studied with a range of lipid-enveloped (LE) and non-lipid-enveloped viruses (NLE) and bacteria. LE viruses were bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). NLE viruses were canine parvovirus (CPV) and simian virus 40 (SV40). Bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus cereus. After spiking and irradiation, samples were tested for residual infectivity and reduction factors (RFs) were calculated. Furthermore, the effect of UVC irradiation on PLT quality was determined by measuring in vitro quality variables. RESULTS A UVC dose of 500 J per m(2) resulted in acceptable PLT quality (as measured by pH, lactate production, CD62P expression, and exposure of phosphatidylserine) and high RFs (>4 log) for CPV, TGEV, VSV, S. epidermidis, S. aureus, and E. coli. Intermediate RFs (approx. 3 log) were observed for BVDV, PRV, and B. cereus. Low RFs (approx. 1 log) were found for HIV and SV40. No differences in virus reduction were observed between cell-free and cell-associated virus. CONCLUSION UVC irradiation is a promising pathogen-reducing technique in PLT concentrates, inactivating bacteria, and a broad range of viruses (with the exception of HIV) under conditions that have limited effects on PLT quality. Further optimization of the UVC procedure, however, is necessary to deal with blood-borne viruses like HIV.","Terpstra, Fokke G; van 't Wout, Angélique B; Schuitemaker, Hanneke; van Engelenburg, Frank A C; Dekkers, David W C; Verhaar, Robin; de Korte, Dirk; Verhoeven, Arthur J",Transfusion,30,7

Reverse transcriptase PCR is now recognized as a sensitive and specific alternative for detection of respiratory RNA viruses. A rapid real-time multiplex PCR assay was developed for the detection of influenza A and influenza B viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV1), PIV2, PIV3, and PIV4 in a two-tube multiplex reaction which used molecular beacons to discriminate the pathogens. A total of 358 respiratory samples taken over a 1-year period were analyzed by the multiplex assay. The incidence of respiratory viruses detected in these samples was 67 of 358 (19%) and 87 of 358 (24%) by culture and real-time PCR, respectively. Culture detected 3 influenza A virus, 2 influenza B virus, 57 RSV, 2 PIV1, and 2 PIV3 infections. All of these culture-positive samples and an additional 5 influenza A virus, 6 RSV, 2 PIV1, 1 PIV2, 1 PIV3, and 3 PIV4 infections were detected by the multiplex real-time PCR. The application of real-time PCR to clinical samples increases the sensitivity for respiratory viral diagnosis. In addition, results can be obtained within 6 h, which increases clinical relevance. Therefore, use of this real-time PCR assay would improve patient management and infection control.","Templeton, Kate E; Scheltinga, Sitha A; Beersma, Matthias F C; Kroes, Aloys C M; Claas, Eric C J",Journal of clinical microbiology,30,1

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in massive amounts of international and national information and guidance. This guidance was often conflicting and not suited to New Zealand midwifery. AIM: To examine and map the national and international guidance and information provided to midwifery regarding COVID-19 and foreground learnt lessons for future similar crises. METHODS: A systematic scoping review informed by Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage framework. A range of sources from grey and empirical literature was identified and 257 sources included. FINDINGS: Four categories were identified and discussed: (1) guidance for provision of maternity care in the community; (2) guidance for provision of primary labour and birth care; (3) Guidance for midwifery care to women/wahine with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 infection, including screening processes and management of neonates of infected women/wahine (4) Guidance for midwives on protecting self and own families and whanau (extended family) from COVID-19 exposure. CONCLUSION: Guidance was mainly targeted and tailored for hospital-based services. This was at odds with the NZ context, where primary continuity of care underpins practice. It is evident that those providing continuity of care constantly needed to navigate an evolving situation to mitigate interruptions and restrictions to midwifery care, often without fully knowing the personal risk to themselves and their own families. A key message is the need for a single source of evidence-based guidance, regularly updated and timestamped to show where advice changes over time.","Crowther, Susan; Maude, Robyn; Zhao, Ivy Y; Bradford, Billie; Gilkison, Andrea",Women and birth (Online),30,20

Recent clinical guidelines have supported the use of corticosteroids or remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19. However, uncertainty remains about which patients are most likely to benefit from treatment with either drug; such knowledge is crucial for avoiding preventable adverse effects, minimizing costs, and effectively allocating resources. This study presents a machine-learning system with the capacity to identify patients in whom treatment with a corticosteroid or remdesivir is associated with improved survival time. METHODS: Gradient-boosted decision-tree models used for predicting treatment benefit were trained and tested on data from electronic health records dated between December 18, 2019, and October 18, 2020, from adult patients (age &#8805;18 years) with COVID-19 in 10 US hospitals. Models were evaluated for performance in identifying patients with longer survival times when treated with a corticosteroid versus remdesivir. Fine and Gray proportional-hazards models were used for identifying significant findings in treated and nontreated patients, in a subset of patients who received supplemental oxygen, and in patients identified by the algorithm. Inverse probability-of-treatment weights were used to adjust for confounding. Models were trained and tested separately for each treatment. FINDINGS: Data from 2364 patients were included, with men comprising slightly more than 50% of the sample; 893 patients were treated with remdesivir, and 1471 were treated with a corticosteroid. After adjustment for confounding, neither corticosteroids nor remdesivir use was associated with increased survival time in the overall population or in the subpopulation that received supplemental oxygen. However, in the populations identified by the algorithms, both corticosteroids and remdesivir were significantly associated with an increase in survival time, with hazard ratios of 0.56 and 0.40, respectively (both, P = 0.04). IMPLICATIONS: Machine-learning methods have the capacity to identify hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in whom treatment with a corticosteroid or remdesivir is associated with an increase in survival time. These methods may help to improve patient outcomes and allocate resources during the COVID-19 crisis.","Lam, Carson; Siefkas, Anna; Zelin, Nicole S; Barnes, Gina; Dellinger, R Phillip; Vincent, Jean-Louis; Braden, Gregory; Burdick, Hoyt; Hoffman, Jana; Calvert, Jacob; Mao, Qingqing; Das, Ritankar",Clin. ther,30,20

Potential predictors of per-capita coronavirus-related mortality in 200 countries by May 9, 2020 were examined, including age, gender, obesity prevalence, temperature, urbanization, smoking, duration of the outbreak, lockdowns, viral testing, contact-tracing policies, and public mask-wearing norms and policies. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed. In univariate analysis, the prevalence of smoking, per-capita gross domestic product, urbanization, and colder average country temperature were positively associated with coronavirus-related mortality. In a multivariable analysis of 196 countries, the duration of the outbreak in the country, and the proportion of the population aged 60 years or older were positively associated with per-capita mortality, whereas duration of mask-wearing by the public was negatively associated with mortality (all P < 0.001). Obesity and less stringent international travel restrictions were independently associated with mortality in a model which controlled for testing policy. Viral testing policies and levels were not associated with mortality. Internal lockdown was associated with a nonsignificant 2.4% reduction in mortality each week (P = 0.83). The association of contact-tracing policy with mortality was not statistically significant (P = 0.06). In countries with cultural norms or government policies supporting public mask-wearing, per-capita coronavirus mortality increased on average by just 16.2% each week, as compared with 61.9% each week in remaining countries. Societal norms and government policies supporting the wearing of masks by the public, as well as international travel controls, are independently associated with lower per-capita mortality from COVID-19.","Leffler, Christopher T; Ing, Edsel; Lykins, Joseph D; Hogan, Matthew C; McKeown, Craig A; Grzybowski, Andrzej",Am J Trop Med Hyg,30,20

Recent studies have suggested the ability of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to inhibit IFN responses. Emerging data also suggest that timing and extent of IFN production is associated with manifestation of COVID-19 severity. In spite of progress in understanding how SARS-CoV-2 activates antiviral responses, mechanistic studies into wildtype SARS-CoV-2-mediated induction and inhibition of human type I IFN responses are scarce. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a type I IFN response in vitro and in moderate cases of COVID-19. In vitro stimulation of type I IFN expression and signaling in human airway epithelial cells is associated with activation of canonical transcriptions factors, and SARS-CoV-2 is unable to inhibit exogenous induction of these responses. Furthermore, we show that physiological levels of IFN&#945; detected in patients with moderate COVID-19 is sufficient to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication in human airway cells.","Banerjee, Arinjay; El-Sayes, Nader; Budylowski, Patrick; Jacob, Rajesh Abraham; Richard, Daniel; Maan, Hassaan; Aguiar, Jennifer A; Demian, Wael L; Baid, Kaushal; D039,; Agostino, Michael R; Ang, Jann Catherine; Murdza, Tetyana; Tremblay, Benjamin J-M; Afkhami, Sam; Karimzadeh, Mehran; Irving, Aaron T; Yip, Lily; Ostrowski, Mario; Hirota, Jeremy A; Kozak, Robert; Capellini, Terence D; Miller, Matthew S; Wang, Bo; Mubareka, Samira; McGeer, Allison J; McArthur, Andrew G; Doxey, Andrew C; Mossman, Karen",iScience,30,1

The SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins mediate viral entry and represent the main target for antibody responses. Humoral responses were shown to be important for preventing and controlling infection by coronaviruses. A promising approach to reduce the severity of COVID-19 is the transfusion of convalescent plasma. However, longitudinal studies revealed that the level of antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike declines rapidly after the resolution of the infection. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To extend this observation beyond the RBD domain, we performed a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike in the plasma from 15 convalescent donors. We generated a 293T cell line constitutively expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and used it to develop a high-throughput flow cytometry-based assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific antibodies in the plasma of convalescent donors. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We found that the level of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike declines gradually after the resolution of the infection. This decline was not related to the number of donations but strongly correlated with the decline of RBD-specific antibodies and the number of days post-symptom onset. These findings help to better understand the decline of humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and provide important information on when to collect plasma after recovery from active infection for convalescent plasma transfusion.","Anand, Sai Priya; Prévost, Jérémie; Richard, Jonathan; Perreault, Josée; Tremblay, Tony; Drouin, Mathieu; Fournier, Marie-Josée; Lewin, Antoine; Bazin, Renée; Finzi, Andrés",Transfusion,30,22

Although the terms refer to a political and public health strategy - contain the virus, flatten the peak of the epidemic, mitigate its effects - we offer a psychosocial reading that draws attention to the relation between time and care embedded in each term. We do so to call for the development of a form of care-ful attention under conditions that tend to prompt action rather than reflection, closing down time for thinking. Using Adriana Cavarero's notion of 'horrorism', in which violence is enacted at precisely the point that care is most needed, we discuss the ever-present possibility of failures within acts of care. We argue that dwelling in the temporality of delay can be understood as an act of care if delaying allows us to pay care-ful attention to violence. We then circle back to a point in twentieth-century history - World War II - that was also concerned with an existential threat requiring a response from a whole population. Our purpose is not to invoke a fantasised narrative of 'Blitz spirit', but to suggest that the British psychoanalytic tradition born of that moment offers resources for understanding how to keep thinking while 'under fire' through containing unbearable anxiety and the capacity for violence in the intersubjective space and time between people. In conditions of lockdown and what will be a long and drawn-out 'after life' of COVID-19, this commitment to thinking in and with delay and containment might help to inhabit this time of waiting - waiting that is the management and mitigation of a future threat, but also a time of care in and for the present.","Salisbury, Laura; Baraitser, Lisa",Wellcome Open Res.,30,16

While diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is recognised to be the primary manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia, there has been little emphasis on the progression to the fibrosing phase of DAD. This topic is of great interest, due to growing concerns regarding the potential long-term complications in prolonged survivors. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we report a detailed histopathological study of 30 autopsy cases with COVID-19 virus infection, based on minimally invasive autopsies performed between February and March, 2020. The mean age was 69 years, with 20 (67%) males and 10 (33%) females and frequent (70.0%) underlying comorbidities. The duration of illness ranged from 16 to 82 (median = 42) days. Histologically, the most common manifestation was diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in 28 (93.3%) cases which showed predominantly acute (32%), organising (25%) and/or fibrosing (43%) patterns. Patients with fibrosing DAD were one decade younger (P = 0.034) and they had a longer duration of illness (P = 0.033), hospitalisation (P = 0.037) and mechanical ventilation (P = 0.014) compared to those with acute DAD. Patients with organising DAD had a longer duration of illness (P = 0.032) and hospitalisation (P = 0.023) compared to those with acute DAD. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pneumonia patients who develop DAD can progress to the fibrosing pattern. While we observed fibrosing DAD in fatal cases, whether or not surviving patients are at risk for developing pulmonary fibrosis and the frequency of this complication will require further clinical and radiological follow-up studies.","Li, Yan; Wu, Junhua; Wang, Sihua; Li, Xiang; Zhou, Junjie; Huang, Bo; Luo, Danju; Cao, Qin; Chen, Yajun; Chen, Shuo; Ma, Lin; Peng, Li; Pan, Huaxiong; Travis, William D; Nie, Xiu",Histopathology,30,20

We need to establish a practical method to improve the efficiency of treatment and optimize the allocation of medical resources. Due to the influx of a large number of patients into the hospital and the running of medical resources, blood routine test became the only possible check while COVID-19 patients first go to a fever clinic in a community hospital. This study aims to establish an efficient method to identify key indicators from initial blood routine test results for COVID-19 severity prediction. We determined that age is a key indicator for severity predicting of COVID-19, with an accuracy of 0.77 and an AUC of 0.92. In order to improve the accuracy of prediction, we proposed a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) algorithm, which combines the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier, to further select effective indicators from patients' initial blood test results. The MCDM algorithm selected 3 dominant feature subsets: {Age, WBC, LYMC, NEUT} with a selection rate of 44%, {Age, NEUT, LYMC} with a selection rate of 38%, and {Age, WBC, LYMC} with a selection rate of 9%. Using these feature subsets, the optimized prediction model could achieve an accuracy of 0.82 and an AUC of 0.93. These results indicated that Age, WBC, LYMC, NEUT were the key factors for COVID-19 severity prediction. Using age and the indicators selected by the MCDM algorithm from initial blood routine test results can effectively predict the severity of COVID-19. Our research could not only help medical workers identify patients with severe COVID-19 at an early stage, but also help doctors understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 through key indicators.","Luo, Jiaqing; Zhou, Lingyun; Feng, Yunyu; Li, Bo; Guo, Shujin",PLoS One,30,32

This study aimed to characterize patient-reported concerns about undergoing surgical procedures during the pandemic. METHODS: We administered a cross-sectional survey to patients who had their general and plastic surgical procedures postponed at the onset of the pandemic, asking about barriers to accessing surgical care. Questions addressed dependent care, transportation, employment and insurance status, as well as perceptions of and concerns about COVID-19. Mixed methods and inductive thematic analyses were conducted. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-five patients were interviewed. We identified the following patient concerns: contracting COVID-19 in the hospital (46%), being alone during hospitalization (40%), facing financial stressors (29%), organizing transportation (28%), experiencing changes to health insurance coverage (25%), and arranging care for dependents (18%). Nonwhite participants were 5 and 2.5 times more likely to have concerns about childcare and transportation, respectively. Perceptions of decreased hospital safety and the consequences of possible COVID-19 infection led to delay in rescheduling. Education about safety measures and communication about scheduling partially mitigated concerns about COVID-19. However, uncertainty about timeline for rescheduling and resolution of the pandemic contributed to ongoing concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Providing effective surgical care during this unprecedented time requires both awareness of societal shifts impacting surgical patients and system-level change to address new barriers to care. Eliciting patients' perspectives, adapting processes to address potential barriers, and effectively educating patients about institutional measures to minimize in-hospital transmission of COVID-19 should be integrated into surgical care.","Johnson, Christopher L; Schwartz, Hope; Greenberg, Anya; Hernandez, Sophia; Nnamani Silva, Ogonna N; Wong, Laura E; Martins, Deborah B; Broering, Jeanette M; Kumar, Sandhya B; Bongiovanni, Tasce; Wick, Elizabeth C; Roman, Sanziana A",J Surg Res,30,1

For real-life decision making, we investigate the impact of the planning horizon on the optimal vaccination/social distancing strategy. We find that in order to reduce social distancing in the long run, without overburdening the healthcare system, it is essential to vaccinate the people with the highest contact rates first. That is also the case if the objective is to minimize fatalities provided that the social distancing measures are sufficiently strict. However, for short-term planning it is optimal to focus on the high-risk group.","Grundel, Sara; Heyder, Stefan; Hotz, Thomas; Ritschel, Tobias K. S.; Sauerteig, Philipp; Worthmann, Karl",,30,17

The presence of HLH was described in severely ill patients during the H1N1 influenza epidemic, presenting with pulmonary vascular thrombosis. We tested the hypothesis that genes causing primary HLH regulate pathways linking pulmonary thromboembolism to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using novel network-informed computational algorithms. This approach led to the identification of Neutrophils Extracellular Traps (NETs) as plausible mediators of vascular thrombosis in severe COVID-19 in children and adults. Taken together, the network-informed analysis led us to propose the following model: the release of NETs in response to inflammatory signals acting in concert with SARS-CoV-2 damage the endothelium and direct platelet-activation promoting abnormal coagulation leading to serious complications of COVID-19. The underlying hypothesis is that genetic and/or environmental conditions that favor the release of NETs may predispose individuals to thrombotic complications of COVID-19 due to an increase risk of abnormal coagulation.

Using health registry data, we describe the disease profiles of persons who died after a confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the first three months of the pandemic in Norway. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data from the specialist health service (Norwegian Patient Registry, NPR) and the primary health service (Norwegian Registry for Primary Health Care, NRPHC) were linked to information on positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 from the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS) and on deaths from the National Population Register. The data retrieval included the Norwegian population as of 1 March 2020 with data for confirmed infections, hospitalisations and deaths until 31 May 2020. RESULTS: Of 8 412 persons with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, altogether 244 (2.9 %) died, whereof 133 (55 %) were men. Among those with a confirmed infection, the proportion who died varied from 0.2 % (age < 60 years) to 52 % (age &#8805; 90 years). Altogether 92 (38 %) patients died in hospital. 25 (16 %) of those who died elsewhere had previously been hospitalised for COVID-19.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of all SARS-CoV-2 test results within the UCLA Health System between March 9th and April 29th, 2020. All patients with repeat test results were identified and those with discordant results were reviewed. RESULTS: Between March 9th and April 29th there were 10,165 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 630 (6.2%) were positive. Among the 904 patients with repeat test results, 808 (89.4%) were initially negative and 96 (10.6%) were initially positive. Among the 808 patients with an initial negative test, 15 (1.9%) subsequently tested positive. Eleven cases with an initial negative SARS-CoV-2 test and without a known prior positive SARS-CoV-2 test were reviewed; 6 were employed as healthcare workers and 10 were positive on the second test. CONCLUSIONS: We found a low diagnostic yield of repeat testing for SARS-CoV-2 in our health system. Repeat testing might prove useful in certain clinical scenarios, such as in healthcare workers, when symptoms develop after a negative test, and in hospitalized patients with a high clinical suspicion for COVID-19.","Adamson, Paul C; Goodman-Meza, David; Vijayan, Tara; Yang, Shangxin; Garner, Omai B",Int J Infect Dis,30,11

The aim was to examine the changes in physical fitness and learning outcomes during the enforced period of lockdown caused by outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic and the closure of schools in Italy. Thirty high-school students (14–15 years) were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 15) that performed an at-home workout programme (~60 min., twice a week), or a control group (n = 15) who received only a regular programme of theoretical lessons where no practice takes place. Both groups were synchronized in real-time with the physical education teacher. In order to assess students’ starting level and significant changes reached, at baseline and after training, a battery of standardized assessment motor tests (Standing long jump test, Harvard step test, sit and reach test, and butt kicks test), and an academic achievement test (Amos 8–15) were administered. In comparison to the control group at baseline and the end of the programme, the experimental group reported considerable improvements in motivation and concentration, significant anxiety reduction, and an increase in capacity to organize studying and to be more flexible. Moreover, it was possible to observe the efficacy of the workout to improve learning ability among practicing students (p &lt;0.001). No significant changes were found in the control group. The results suggest that a school-based exercise programme conducted online could be a powerful approach in order to achieve the best academic outcomes and for improving students’ physical fitness as well as their cognitive health.","Latino, Francesca Fischetti Francesco Cataldi Stefania Monacis Domenico Colella Dario",Sustainability,30,32

Lithium niobate, for example, has traditionally been widely used to fabricate high-speed optical modulators due to its large Pockels effect. Another material, barium titanate, nominally has a 50 times stronger r-parameter and would ordinarily be a more attractive material choice for such modulators or other applications. In practice, barium titanate thin films for optical waveguide devices are usually grown on magnesium oxide due to its low refractive index, allowing vertical mode confinement. However, the crystal quality is normally degraded. Here, a group of scandate-based substrates with small lattice mismatch and low refractive index compared to that of barium titanate is identified, thus concurrently satisfying high crystal quality and vertical optical mode confinement. This work provides a platform for nonlinear on-chip optoelectronics and can be promising for waveguide-based optical devices such as Mach-Zehnder modulators, wavelength division multiplexing, and quantum optics-on-chip.","Cao, Yu; Tan, Siew Li; Cheung, Eric Jun Hao; Siew, Shawn Yohanes; Li, Changjian; Liu, Yan; Tang, Chi Sin; Lal, Manohar; Chen, Guanyu; Dogheche, Karim; Yang, Ping; Pennycook, Steven; Wee, Andrew Thye Shen; Chua, Soojin; Dogheche, Elhadj; Venkatesan, Thirumalai; Danner, Aaron",Adv Mater,30,16

It can be estimated relatively directly by testing of random population samples. Without such direct epidemiological measurement, other approaches are required to infer whether the number of new cases is likely to be increasing or decreasing: for example, estimating the pathogen-effective reproduction number, R, using data gathered from the clinical response to the disease. For coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19/SARS-Cov-2), such R estimation is heavily dependent on modelling assumptions, because the available clinical case data are opportunistic observational data subject to severe temporal confounding. Given this difficulty, it is useful to retrospectively reconstruct the time course of infections from the least compromised available data, using minimal prior assumptions. A Bayesian inverse problem approach applied to UK data on first-wave Covid-19 deaths and the disease duration distribution suggests that fatal infections were in decline before full UK lockdown (24 March 2020), and that fatal infections in Sweden started to decline only a day or two later. An analysis of UK data using the model of Flaxman et al. gives the same result under relaxation of its prior assumptions on R, suggesting an enhanced role for non-pharmaceutical interventions short of full lockdown in the UK context. Similar patterns appear to have occurred in the subsequent two lockdowns.","Wood, Simon N",Biometrics,30,9

Scientists all over the world have been heavily invested in the discovery of a drug to combat SARS-CoV-2. It has been found that RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) plays a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 replication, and thus could be a potential drug target. Here, comprehensive computational approaches including drug repurposing and molecular docking were employed to predict an effective drug candidate targeting RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. This study revealed that Rifabutin, Rifapentine, Fidaxomicin, 7-methyl-guanosine-5'-triphosphate-5'-guanosine and Ivermectin have a potential inhibitory interaction with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, and could be effective drugs for COVID-19. In addition, virtual screening of the compounds from ZINC database also allowed the prediction of two compounds (ZINC09128258 and ZINC 09883305) with pharmacophore features that interact effectively with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2; indicating their potentiality as effective inhibitors of the enzyme. Furthermore, ADME analysis along with analysis of toxicity was also investigated to check the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties of the two compounds. Comparative structural analysis of protein-inhibitor complexes revealed that positions of the amino acid Y32, K47, Y122, Y129, H133, N138, D140, T141, S709 and N781 are crucial for drug surface hotspot in the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2.","Parvez, Md.

As such it can only be a snapshot caught in time; it is not a diary of events. The Coronavirus Act 2020 gives Government enormous powers and was passed by Parliament in one day of debate immediately before it closed early for the Easter break. In March, the government imposed a ""lockdown: the closure of all"" but ""essential"" businesses and people other than essential workers must work from home but are allowed out for exercise and food shopping but must maintain 2 m apart, the ""social distancing rule"". The aim is to suppress the spread of the virus, reduce the death toll and ""protect the National Health Service (NHS)"" which needed time to empty wards and expand its intensive care unit (ICU) capability to deal with an expected influx of thousands of very sick patients. I discuss whether this strategy is working, how and why it has rapidly been altered to respond to criticism. Why was the Government so slow to seek the help of private laboratories to assist with testing? Why was the personal protective equipment (PPE) guidance altered only after criticism? I look at the impact of the lockdown on the UK economy, the changes to practice of medicine and speeding of scientific research. Cooperating with the lockdown has its price; is it harming the health and mental health of children, people living in households with potentially abusive partners or parents and those who are disabled or financially desperate? Is the cure worse than the disease? The Economy is being devastated by the lockdown and each day of lockdown it is worse. Is litigation being seeded even now by the pandemic? Notwithstanding unprecedented Government financial help many businesses are on the edge of collapse, people will lose their jobs and pensioners income. The winners include pharmacies, supermarkets, online food retailers, Amazon, online apps, providers of video games, services, streaming and scientific research laboratories, manufacturers of testing kits, ventilators, hand sanitisers, coffins, undertakers, etc. The British public is cooperating with lockdown but are we less productive at home? Parents with babies and children often child minders, school, grandparents or paid help which is not now available. Will current reliance on video-conferencing and video calls permanently change the way we work and will we need smaller city offices? Will we travel less? Will medical and legal practice and civil and criminal trials be generally carried out remotely? Will social distancing with self-isolation and job losses and business failures fuel depression?

Like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 also interacts with host proteins to pave its entry into host cells. Therefore, to understand the behaviour of SARS-CoV-2 and design of effective antiviral drugs, host-virus protein-protein interactions (PPIs) can be very useful. In this regard, we have initially created a human-SARS-CoV-2 PPI database from existing works in the literature which has resulted in 7085 unique PPIs. Subsequently, we have identified at most 10 proteins with highest degrees viz. hub proteins from interacting human proteins for individual virus protein. The identification of these hub proteins is important as they are connected to most of the other human proteins. Consequently, when they get affected, the potential diseases are triggered in the corresponding pathways, thereby leading to comorbidities. Furthermore, the biological significance of the identified hub proteins is shown using KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analysis. KEGG pathway analysis is also essential for identifying the pathways leading to comorbidities. Among others, SARS-CoV-2 proteins viz. NSP2, NSP5, Envelope and ORF10 interacting with human hub proteins like COX4I1, COX5A, COX5B, NDUFS1, CANX, HSP90AA1 and TP53 lead to comorbidities. Such comorbidities are Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, HTLV-1 infection, prostate cancer and viral carcinogenesis. Subsequently, using Enrichr tool possible repurposable drugs which target the human hub proteins are reported in this paper as well. Therefore, this work provides a consolidated study for human-SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions to understand the relationship between comorbidity and hub proteins so that it may pave the way for the development of anti-viral drugs.","Ghosh, Nimisha Saha Indrajit Sharma Nikhil",Computers in biology and medicine,30,29

METHODS: Ninety-six PD patients, which included thirty-nine postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) subtype and fifty-seven tremor-dominant (TD) subtype, were enrolled and allocated to training and validation datasets with a ratio of 7:3. A total of five types of index, consisting of mean regional homogeneity (mReHo), mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mALFF), degree of centrality (DC), voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), and functional connectivity (FC), were extracted. The features were then selected using a two-sample t-test, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) models based on the separate index and multilevel indices were built, and the performance of models was assessed via the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Feature importance was evaluated using Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values. RESULTS: The optimal SVM model was obtained based on multilevel rs-fMRI indices, with an AUC of 0.934 in the training dataset and an AUC of 0.917 in the validation dataset. The AUCs of the models based on the separate index were ranged from 0.783 to 0.858 for the training dataset and from 0.713 to 0.792 for the validation dataset. SHAP analysis revealed that functional activity and connectivity in frontal lobe and cerebellum were important features for differentiating PD subtypes.

METHODS: A survey was distributed among patients undergoing IBD-related surgeries from January 2020 to March 2020 via an online platform. The response was submitted anonymously. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients responded to the survey. COVID-19 testing was conducted in 60 (76.9%) patients, and they were all tested negative. Emergent surgery was performed in 12 (15.4%) patients and postponed surgery in 18 (23.1%) patients. The surgical indications were mainly bowel obstruction (N = 21, 26.9%) and perianal abscess (N = 18, 23.1%). Postoperative complications were noted in 5.1% of cases, but no re-operation was required. Due to the ongoing COVID pandemic, 58 (74.4%) patients reported various levels of concern and anxiety for surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Common surgical indications were for bowel obstruction and perianal abscess. Surgery can be postponed, but disease progression should be monitored closely and surgically intervened as needed. Most patients expressed anxiety resulting from the pandemic.

The present study examined age differences in pandemic-related stress and social ties, and links with psychological well-being. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants included 645 adults (43% women) ages 18 to 97 (M = 50.8; SD = 17.7) from the May 2020 nationally representative Survey of Consumers. Participants reported the extent to which they felt stress related to the pandemic in the last month, the extent to which their lives had changed due to the pandemic, as well as social isolation, negative relationship quality, positive relationship quality, and frequency of depression, anxiety and rumination in the past week. RESULTS: Results showed that older people reported less pandemic-related stress, less life change, less social isolation, and lower negative relationship quality than younger people. Greater pandemic-related stress, life change, social isolation, and negative relationship quality were associated with poorer psychological well-being. Poorer social ties (i.e., greater social isolation, and negative quality) exacerbated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (stress, life change) on psychological well-being. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Researchers have indicated that older adults may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 pandemic-related stress and social isolation, but this study indicates that young adults may be relatively more vulnerable. Because isolation and negative relationship quality appear to exacerbate the deleterious effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being, reducing social isolation and negative relations are potential targets for intervention.","Birditt, Kira S; Turkelson, Angela; Fingerman, Karen L; Polenick, Courtney A; Oya, Akari",GerontologistGerontologist,30,24

In the absence of detailed veterinary research, an in-depth review of the human medical literature was conducted to evaluate the viability of reusable, sterilizable cloth, medical textile, or other material alternatives that may be quickly manufactured and used by veterinarians. The results at the time of publication support the AVMA, CDC, and WHO recommendations to extend use, reuse, and resterilize facemasks before considering using a homemade facemask. Pending further research, or until and unless the FDA certifies a reusable homemade mask or design, the substitution of homemade masks for FDA-certified surgical masks should only be considered as a last resort. Most homemade masks are not suitable replacements for N95 FFRs. If a homemade facemask must be made, the following materials and testing guidelines are suggested: - densely woven cotton fabric (≥270 thread count), medical textile, or other impermeable, breathable material that can be laundered and resterilized - make pleated or fitted pocket style facemasks to maximize fit - make masks with two sets of ties, not elastics, to endure laundering and autoclaving - internal wire or fabric tape may be used to mold masks over the nose - filter material should be designed for use near mucus membranes, such as facial tissue or paper towel - if possible, fit test homemade masks against an FDA-certified surgical mask as a control - if higher filtration efficiency is required, test according to the FDA Enforcement Policy for Face Masks and Respirators During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency - Maintain enough masks to change as frequently as one would change disposable surgical masks to maintain appropriate hygiene.","Purens, Abigail Gavra Michaelson",Front.

People with opioid use disorder (OUD) are facing unique challenges in response to COVID-19, such as not being able to adopt best practices (e.g., physical distancing) if they're financially insecure or living in shelters (or homeless). They also have other medical conditions that make them more likely to be immunocompromised and at risk of developing COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 public health emergency, national and provincial regulatory bodies introduced guidance and exemptions to mitigate the spread of the virus. Among them, clinical guidance for prescribers were issued to allow take home opioid medications for opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Take Home for injectable opioid agonist treatment (iOAT) is only considered within a restrictive regulatory structure, specific to the pandemic. Nevertheless, this risk mitigation guidance allowed carries, mostly daily dispensed, to a population that would not have access to it prior to the pandemic. In this case it is presented and discussed that if a carry was possible during the pandemic, then the carry could continue post COVID-19 to address a gap in our approach to individualize care for people with OUD receiving iOAT. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present the first case of a patient in Canada with long-term OUD that received take home injectable diacetylmorphine to self-isolate in an approved site after being diagnosed with COVID-19 during a visit to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with cellulitis and admitted to receive antibiotics. CONCLUSION: In the present case we demonstrated that it is feasible to provide iOAT outside the community clinic with no apparent negative consequences. Improving upon and making permanent these recently introduced risk mitigating guidance during COVID-19, have the potential not just to protect during the pandemic, but also to address long-overdue barriers to access evidence-based care in addiction treatment.","Oviedo-Joekes, Eugenia; MacDonald, Scott; Boissonneault, Charles; Harper, Kelli",Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy,30,16

Then, considering the index models of these five vectors, we established the disaster loss composite index model, which was used to conduct environmental risk assessment and disaster loss composite index analysis of the transmission of COVID-19 in Hubei Province during the period of January 21, 2020 to March 18, 2020. The empirical study showed that: (1) the risk index peaked from January 21 to January 23; (2) the risk index was at a low but volatile level from January 24 to March 14; (3) the risk index rose again slightly from March 15 and rose to another peak on March 16. These fluctuating, smooth and fluctuating processes of the comprehensive index of disaster losses of COVID-19 in Hubei Province are basically stable and consistent with the actual situation of the virus outbreak in the early stage, isolation and prevention and control in the middle stage, and resumption of work and production in the late stage.

An overwhelming majority of published literature on the pathologic findings associated with COVID-19 is either from living clinical cohorts or from autopsy findings of those who died in a medical care setting, which can confound pure disease pathology. A relatively low initial infection rate paired with a high biosafety level enabled the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator to conduct full autopsy examinations on suspected COVID-19-related deaths. Full autopsy examination on the first 20 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive decedents revealed that some extent of diffuse alveolar damage in every death due to COVID-19 played some role. The average decedent was middle-aged, male, American Indian, and overweight with comorbidities that included diabetes, ethanolism, and atherosclerotic and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease. Macroscopic thrombotic events were seen in 35% of cases consisting of pulmonary thromboemboli and coronary artery thrombi. In 2 cases, severe bacterial coinfections were seen in the lungs.

Moreover, they have important implications for how the treatment is imagined, implemented and funded. Service provision which follows engagement in an intensive (usually residential) program is often called 'aftercare' in the international AOD field. In this commentary, we argue that the term 'aftercare' fails to articulate the nature of ongoing care required by people who are managing AOD use. We maintain that 'aftercare' positions post-residential care as being less important than other treatment modalities, rather than as integral to a continuum of care. It is a term that implies that care should be acute, like much treatment delivered through a medical model, and assumes that people follow linear pathways in managing their AOD use. Assumptions embedded in the term 'aftercare' such as these may disincline governments from funding ongoing services for people exiting intensive programs. Alternative terms including 'continuing coordinated care' more aptly signal the integrated and ongoing service provision that should be available to support people in sustaining changes initiated through other AOD interventions.","MacLean, Sarah J; Caluzzi, Gabriel; Ferry, Mark; Bruun, Andrew; Skattebol, Jennifer; Neale, Joanne; Bryant, Joanne",Drug alcohol rev,30,12

In the face of new obligations, our promise is to strive for a more responsive and resilient health system during this prolonged crisis.","Yoo, Seung Mi; Chung, Seol Hee; Jang, Won Mo; Kim, Kyoung Chang; Lee, Jin Yong; Kim, Sun Min",J Prev Med Public Health,30,21

METHOD AND RESULTS: We included all patients reported to the Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation from 1 January to 20 July 2020. We defined 16 March 2020 as the start of the pandemic. We assessed overall and 30-day mortality using Cox regression and logistic regression, respectively. We studied 1946 cases of OHCA and 1080 cases of IHCA during the entire period. During the pandemic, 88 (10.0%) of OHCAs and 72 (16.1%) of IHCAs had ongoing COVID-19. With regards to OHCA during the pandemic, the odds ratio for 30-day mortality in COVID-19-positive cases, compared with COVID-19-negative cases, was 3.40 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-11.64]; the corresponding hazard ratio was 1.45 (95% CI 1.13-1.85). Adjusted 30-day survival was 4.7% for patients with COVID-19, 9.8% for patients without COVID-19, and 7.6% in the pre-pandemic period. With regards to IHCA during the pandemic, the odds ratio for COVID-19-positive cases, compared with COVID-19-negative cases, was 2.27 (95% CI 1.27-4.24); the corresponding hazard ratio was 1.48 (95% CI 1.09-2.01). Adjusted 30-day survival was 23.1% in COVID-19-positive cases, 39.5% in patients without COVID-19, and 36.4% in the pre-pandemic period. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic phase, COVID-19 was involved in at least 10% of all OHCAs and 16% of IHCAs, and, among COVID-19 cases, 30-day mortality was increased 3.4-fold in OHCA and 2.3-fold in IHCA.","Sultanian, Pedram; Lundgren, Peter; Strömsöe, Anneli; Aune, Solveig; Bergström, Göran; Hagberg, Eva; Hollenberg, Jacob; Lindqvist, Jonny; Djärv, Therese; Castelheim, Albert; Thorén, Anna; Hessulf, Fredrik; Svensson, Leif; Claesson, Andreas; Friberg, Hans; Nordberg, Per; Omerovic, Elmir; Rosengren, Annika; Herlitz, Johan; Rawshani, Araz",Eur Heart J,30,20

Religion scholars argue that religion is multi-faceted and better understood by focusing on combinations of indicators (i.e. mosaics), versus a variable-centered approach. We adopt this framework and investigate the interplay between religion and peer networks, both in how religious mosaics are shaped by friends and how religious profiles affect friend selection dynamics. With data from two schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we estimate religious mosaics using latent class analysis (LCA) to identify profiles consisting of combinations of commonly available survey-based measures of religious attitudes, behaviors, and identities. Finding evidence of theoretically-expected profiles, we then use stochastic actor based models (SABMs) to investigate network dynamics for these LCA-based religious profiles. We demonstrate how the profile data can be integrated within the SABM framework to evaluate processes of friend selection and influence. Results show evidence of adolescents influencing one another's religious mosaics, but not selecting friends on that basis.","Adams, Jimi; Schaefer, David R; Ettekal, Andrea Vest",J Sci Study Relig,30,24

The experiments were conducted during the periods (April-May 2020) of strict social and travel restrictions (lockdown) imposed by the Government of India aiming to contain the spread of Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. The different phases of the COVID-19 lockdown witnessed restrictions of varying magnitudes with the significant cessation of anthropogenic sources, viz., industrial, road, railways, and air traffic emissions. Using this unique opportunity, the impact of varying urban emissions on particle number size distributions and new particle formation events were examined. The mean total number concentrations were in the range of ∼ (2 to 3.5) x 104 cm-3 and depicted a gradual increase (∼26%) with progressive unlock of the anthropogenic activities. At the same time, accumulation particle concentrations were doubled. However, ultrafine particles (UFP) (diameter &lt; 100 nm) dominated (50-88%) the total number concentrations during most of the days and several new particle formation (NPF) events resulting in elevated (2 - 5 fold) UFP concentrations were observed. Subsequently, the particles grew to larger sizes with rates ∼3.31- 8.37 nm hr-1. The NPF events occurred during the daytime, and during the events, a clear enhancement in the concentrations of [H2SO4] proxy (2 to 3.5 x 107 molecules cm-3;2-3 orders higher than the non-event values) suggesting the role of strong gas-phase photochemistry. Also, some of the NPF events were associated with increased odd oxygen concentrations [Ox = O3+NO2], indicating the regional nature of the precursors and participation of VOC precursors in nucleation/growth. Interestingly, different classes of NPF events were seen during the strictest lockdown period, whereas more frequent and well-defined NPF events were witnessed when anthropogenic activities were opened up with conditional relaxations. These events demonstrated the competition between source strengths of precursor vapors from anthropogenic activities and primary particles acting as condensation sink restricting NPF. This study highlighted that urban pollution mitigation policies need to consider ultrafine particles emanating from the secondary aerosol formation process from traffic emissions.","Yadav, Shailendra Kumar Kompalli Sobhan Kumar Gurjar Bhola Ram Mishra Rajeev Kumar",Atmospheric Environment,30,14

Similarly, all practical trainings at clinics and on ambulances had to be put on hold. As the apprentices' training objective was acutely endangered by the expected lengthy teaching downtimes, it was of crucial importance to successfully establish homeschooling. While members of our teaching staff were additionally bound by support for the Munich crisis unit, the switch to virtual classroom teaching for all ongoing courses significantly increased the overall workload of the staff. In a first step, we established a fast video and communication platform via Microsoft Skype. All other issues had to be solved on the fly due to the lack of preparation time. Soon it became obvious that using only classic upfront teaching methods was not an option due to the resulting monotony of a full-time 35â¯h training week. Additionally, we had to ensure that exams would also be possible during homeschooling to avoid the accumulation of missing performance assessments. Within a few days, it became clear that almost all forms of social interactions and teaching methods could be integrated into the virtual classroom with minor limitations. A survey among students showed that while homeschooling cannot fully replace classroom teaching, it is considered a good alternative in emergency situations. Furthermore, many trainees think that homeschooling could be a valuable addition to normal classroom teaching. Maybe this crisis could turn out to be the beginning of a new complementary teaching strategy.","Frieß, C; Bayerl, T",Notf Rett Med,30,1

According to recent findings, the carbon dioxide concentration increases by 2.3 to 4.3 times inside of the mask, compared to ambient air, and therefore we suppose that there will be also a concentration increase of larger chemical compounds, toxins, volatile organic compounds (VOC), and particles. These quantities should be measured, and the data used in further research aimed at quality improvement.","Jablonsky, M.; Homola, J.; Masaryk, M.; Slavikova, M.; Homolova, M.; Brazinova, A.; Katuscak, S.",Bioresources,30,1

By the analysis of RNA-sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells combined with data mining we identified genes involved in COVID-19 progression. To characterize their implication in the fibrosis development we established a correlation matrix based on the transcriptomic data of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. With this method, we have identified a cluster of genes responsible for SARS-CoV-2-fibrosis including its entry receptor ACE2 and epidermal growth factor EGF. Then, we developed Vi-Fi scoring-a novel drug repurposing approach and simultaneously quantified antiviral and antifibrotic activities of the drugs based on their transcriptomic signatures. We revealed the strong dual antifibrotic and antiviral activity of EGFR/ErbB inhibitors. Before the in vitro validation, we have clustered 277 cell lines and revealed distinct COVID-19 transcriptomic signatures of the cells with similar phenotypes that defines their suitability for COVID-19 research. By ERK activity monitoring in living lung cells, we show that the drugs with predicted antifibrotic activity downregulate ERK in the host lung cells. Overall, our study provides novel insights on SARS-CoV-2 dependence on EGFR/ERK signaling and demonstrates the utility of EGFR/ErbB inhibitors for COVID-19 treatment.","Vagapova, Elmira R; Lebedev, Timofey D; Prassolov, Vladimir S",Sci Rep,30,1

OBJECTIVE: Here, we report the clinical characteristics of the newborns delivered by SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women. METHODS: We prospectively collected and analyzed the clinical features, laboratory data and outcomes of 7 newborns delivered by SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University during January 20 to January 29, 2020. RESULTS: 4 of the 7 newborns were late preterm with gestational age between 36 weeks and 37 weeks, and the other 3 were full-term infants. The average birth weight was 2096 ± 660 g. All newborns were born without asphyxia. 2 premature infants performed mild grunting after birth, but relieved rapidly with non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) ventilation. 3 cases had chest X-ray, 1 was normal and 2 who were supported by nCPAP presented mild neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS). Samples of pharyngeal swab in 6 cases, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood in 4 cases were tested by qRT-PCR, and there was no positive result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: The current data show that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in late pregnant women does not cause adverse outcomes in their newborns, however, it is necessary to separate newborns from mothers immediately to avoid the potential threats.","Yang, Pu; Wang, Xia; Liu, Pin; Wei, Cong; He, Bingyan; Zheng, Junwen; Zhao, Dongchi",J Clin Virol,30,16

As time evolves in the present pandemic, it appears more and more clearly that a clustered dynamics is a key element of the description. This means that the disease rapidly evolves within spatially localized networks, that diffuse and eventually create new clusters. We improve upon the simplest possible compartmental model, the SIR model, by adding an additional compartment associated with the clustered individuals. This sophistication is compatible with more advanced compartmental models and allows, at the lowest level of complexity, to leverage the well-mixedness assumption. The so-obtained SBIR model takes into account the effect of inhomogeneity on epidemic spreading, and compares satisfactorily with results on the pandemic propagation in a number of European countries, during and immediately after lock-down. Especially, the decay exponent of the number of new cases after the first peak of the epidemic is captured without the need to vary the coefficients of the model with time. We show that this decay exponent is directly determined by the diffusion of the ensemble of clustered individuals and can be related to a global reproduction number, that overrides the classical, local reproduction number.","Bos, Wouter J T; Bertoglio, Jean-Pierre; Gostiaux, Louis",Comput Mech,30,0

We analyzed articles published in international peer-reviewed journals and official data from China, Germany, and Italy, as well as WHO reports regarding COVID-19 in children for December 2019–March 2020. The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes disease in children of all age groups (including newborns), although it is milder than that in adults. This trend was observed during SARS-Cov-1 and MERS outbreaks. Approximately one-third of children have asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, including cases with pneumonia. Pregnant women have COVID-19 as frequently as non-pregnant women; however, vertical transmission of the virus to the fetus has not yet been confirmed or definitively rejected. We reviewed currently available information on possibilities of COVID-19 therapy in children from different age groups, depending on the disease severity. Despite the fact that most experts agree that children tend to have mild and often asymptomatic disease, there are still many factors suggesting the need for a long-term follow-up of such children, including those who had family contacts with COVID-19 patients. These factors encompass combined organ lesions, possible asymptomatic myocarditis and pneumonia in the early stages, prolonged excretion of virus particles in bodily fluids even after the elimination of the main symptoms, and uncertainty about the outcomes and consequences of the disease.","Melekhina, Еlena V.; Gorelov, Aleksandr V.; Muzyka, Anna D.",Vopr.

This study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. METHODS: A cohort of 158 employees, who were identified as high risk to respiratory biohazard exposure, were invited to participate in the RPP. We provided a bundle of interventions, which included an online training package, and mandatory quantitative fit testing. The main outcomes included the participants' knowledge and attitude toward respiratory protection equipment (RPE), which were assessed via an online survey. Their donning and doffing skills, and user seal check techniques on four different types of N95 respirators were also assessed by an observer using a pre-determined marking sheet. We compared these outcomes before and after participation in the program. RESULTS: There was a total of 125 participants, all of whom completed the knowledge and attitude assessment, and 69 completed the skill assessment before and after the program. There was a statistically significant improvement in their knowledge scores, donning and doffing skills, and user seal check techniques after participation in the RPP. Participants also reported significant increased level of confidence in their RPE knowledge, training and skills; and workplace safety. CONCLUSION: This initial report of the implementation of a novel RPP in a Victorian major tertiary hospital provides guidance on the benefits to respiratory protection, staff knowledge, skills, confidence and morale that can be acquired from a scalable online training package combined with mandatory quantitative fit testing.","Williams, D; Kave, B; Begg, F; Marshall, C; Segal, R; Ng, I",Infect.

METHODS: Ninety-four consecutive patients (mean age 64 years) admitted for acute respiratory failure on COVID-19 were enrolled. Coupling of right ventricular function to the pulmonary circulation was evaluated by a comprehensive trans-thoracic echocardiography with focus on the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) to systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PASP) ratio RESULTS: The majority of patients needed ventilatory support, which was noninvasive in 22 and invasive in 37. There were 25 deaths, all in the invasively ventilated patients. Survivors were younger (62 ± 13 vs. 68 ± 12 years, p = 0.033), less often overweight or usual smokers, had lower NT-proBNP and interleukin-6, and higher arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired O2 (FIO2) ratio (270 ± 104 vs. 117 ± 57 mmHg, p < 0.001). In the non-survivors, PASP was increased (42 ± 12 vs. 30 ± 7 mmHg, p < 0.001), while TAPSE was decreased (19 ± 4 vs. 25 ± 4 mm, p < 0.001). Accordingly, the TAPSE/PASP ratio was lower than in the survivors (0.51 ± 0.22 vs. 0.89 ± 0.29 mm/mmHg, p < 0.001). At univariate/multivariable analysis, the TAPSE/PASP (HR: 0.026; 95%CI 0.01-0.579; p: 0.019) and PaO2/FIO2 (HR: 0.988; 95%CI 0.988-0.998; p: 0.018) ratios were the only independent predictors of mortality, with ROC-determined cutoff values of 159 mmHg and 0.635 mm/mmHg, respectively.

This study aimed at investigating the role of functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMAs) on in-hospital COVID-19 mortality. In this retrospective cohort study, we included adult in-patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 with definite outcomes (discharged hospital or deceased) from Erasme Hospital (Brussels, Belgium). We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. We included 350 patients (205 males, 145 females) with a mean age of 63.24 years (SD = 17.4, range: 21-96 years). Seventy-two patients died in the hospital and 278 were discharged.

Setting: Mayo Clinic, a large multistate integrated health care system with over 1.5 million annual patient visits that utilizes the Epic© electronic health record (EHR) system. Methods and Results: Rule-based live registries were designed in EHR system to classify patients who 1) are currently tested positive for COVID-19; 2) were tested positive but has recovered from COVID-19; 3) are suspected of COVID-19 but did not yet meet clinical diagnostic criteria,; 4) had tested negative for COVID-19; and 5) exceeded a risk score for serious complications from COVID-19. Using registries, custom dashboards and operational reports were developed to provide daily high-level summary for clinical practice use and provide up to date information used to manage individual patients impacted by COVID-19, including support of case identification, contact isolation and other care management tasks. Conclusion: we developed and implemented a systematic approach for using EHR patient registries to manage the COVID-19 pandemic that proved feasible and useful for managing a large multistate group clinical practice. The key to harnessing the potential of digital surveillance tools to promote patient-centered care during COVID-19 pandemic was to use the registry data, reports and dashboards as informatics tools to inform decision-making.","Jose, Thulasee; Warner, David O; O039,; Horo, John C; Peters, Steve G; Chaudhry, Rajeev; Binnicker, Matthew J; Burger, Charles D",,30,1

PURPOSE: To evaluate for the presence of myocardial involvement in recovered COVID-19 patients without cardiovascular symptoms and abnormal serologic markers during hospitalization. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. POPULATION: Twenty-one recovered COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls (HC). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0 T, cine, T2-weighted imaging, T1 mapping, and T2 mapping. ASSESSMENT: Cardiac ventricular function includes end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume, cardiac output, left ventricle (LV) mass, and ejection fraction (EF) of LV and right ventricle (RV), and segmental myocardial T1 and T2 values were measured. STATISTICAL TESTS: Student's t-test, univariate general linear model test, and chi-square test were used for analyses between two groups. Ordinary one-way analyses of variance or Kruskal-Wallis H test were used for analyses between three groups, followed by post-hoc analyses. RESULTS: Fifteen (71.43%) COVID-19 patients had abnormal magnetic resonance findings, including raised myocardial native T1 (5, 23.81%) and T2 values (10, 47.62%), decreased LVEF (1, 4.76%), and RVEF (2, 9.52%). The segmental myocardial T2 value of COVID-19 patients (49.20 [46.1, 54.6] msec) was significantly higher than HC (48.3 [45.2, 51.7] msec) (P < 0.001), while the myocardial native T1 value showed no significant difference between COVID-19 patients and HC. The myocardial T2 value of serious COVID-19 patients (52.5 [48.1, 57.1] msec) was significantly higher than unserious COVID-19 patients (48.8 [45.9, 53.8] msec) and HC (48.3 [45.2, 51.7]) (P < 0.001). COVID-19 patients with abnormally elevated D-dimer, C-reactive protein, or lymphopenia showed higher myocardial T2 values than without (all P < 0.05).

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, binds to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and replicates within the cells of the nasal cavity, then spreads along the airway tracts, causing mild clinical manifestations, and, in a majority of patients, a persisting loss of smell. In some individuals, SARS-CoV-2 reaches and infects several organs, including the lung, leading to severe pulmonary disease. SARS-CoV-2 induces neurological symptoms, likely contributing to morbidity and mortality through unknown mechanisms. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid with pleiotropic properties and functions in many tissues, including the nervous system. S1P regulates neurogenesis and inflammation and it is implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS). Notably, Fingolimod (FTY720), a modulator of S1P receptors, has been approved for the treatment of MS and is being tested for COVID-19. Here, we discuss the putative role of S1P on viral infection and in the modulation of inflammation and survival in the stem cell niche of the olfactory epithelium. This could help to design therapeutic strategies based on S1P-mediated signaling to limit or overcome the host-virus interaction, virus propagation and the pathogenesis and complications involving the nervous system.","Meacci, Elisabetta; Garcia-Gil, Mercedes; Pierucci, Federica",Int. j. mol. sci.

We investigated the relationship between duration of mechanical ventilation prior to tracheostomy insertion and in-hospital mortality. In addition, we present a machine learning approach to facilitate decision-making. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Guy's & St Thomas' Hospital, London, United Kingdom. Patients: Consecutive patients admitted with acute respiratory failure secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 requiring mechanical ventilation between March 3, 2020, and May 5, 2020. Interventions: Baseline characteristics and temporal trends in markers of disease severity were prospectively recorded. Tracheostomy was performed for anticipated prolonged ventilatory wean when levels of respiratory support were favorable. Decision tree was constructed using C4.5 algorithm, and its classification performance has been evaluated by a leave-one-out cross-validation technique. Measurements and Main Results: One-hundred seventy-six patients required mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure, of which 87 patients (49.4%) underwent tracheostomy. We identified that optimal timing for tracheostomy insertion is between day 13 and day 17. Presence of fibrosis on CT scan (odds ratio, 13.26; 95% CI [3.61-48.91]; p &#8804; 0.0001) and Pao2:Fio2 ratio (odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI [0.95-0.99]; p = 0.008) were independently associated with tracheostomy insertion. Cox multiple regression analysis showed that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (hazard ratio, 6.56; 95% CI [1.04-41.59]; p = 0.046), ischemic heart disease (hazard ratio, 4.62; 95% CI [1.19-17.87]; p = 0.027), positive end-expiratory pressure (hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% CI [1.02-1.57]; p = 0.034), Pao2:Fio2 ratio (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI [0.97-0.99]; p = 0.003), and C-reactive protein (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI [1-1.01]; p = 0.005) were independent late predictors of in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: We propose that the optimal window for consideration of tracheostomy for ventilatory weaning is between day 13 and 17. Late predictors of mortality may serve as adverse factors when considering tracheostomy, and our decision tree provides a degree of decision support for clinicians.","Takhar, Arunjit; Surda, Pavol; Ahmad, Imran; Amin, Nikul; Arora, Asit; Camporota, Luigi; Denniston, Poppy; El-Boghdadly, Kariem; Kvassay, Miroslav; Macekova, Denisa; Munk, Michal; Ranford, David; Rabcan, Jan; Tornari, Chysostomos; Wyncoll, Duncan; Zaitseva, Elena; Hart, Nicholas; Tricklebank, Stephen",Crit Care Explor,30,16

There are several HSPs, including HSPA5, also known as 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) or binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP) that is an ER resident involved in the folding of polypeptides during their translocation into this compartment prior to the transition to the Golgi network. HSPA5 is detected on the surface of cells or secreted into the extracellular environment. Surface HSPA5 has been proposed to have various roles, such as receptor-mediated signal transduction, a co-receptor for soluble ligands, as well as a participant in tumor survival, proliferation, and resistance. Recently, surface HSPA5 has been reported to be a potential receptor of some viruses, including the novel SARS-CoV-2. In spite of these observations, the association of HSPA5 within the plasma membrane is still unclear. To gain information about this process, we studied the interaction of HSPA5 with liposomes made of different phospholipids. We found that HSPA5 has a high affinity for negatively charged phospholipids, such as palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphoserine (POPS) and cardiolipin (CL). The N-terminal and C-terminal domains of HSPA5 were independently capable of interacting with negatively charged phospholipids, but to a lesser extent than the full-length protein, suggesting that both domains are required for the maximum insertion into membranes. Interestingly, we found that the interaction of HSPA5 with negatively charged liposomes promotes an oligomerization process via intermolecular disulfide bonds in which the N-terminus end of the protein plays a critical role.","Dores-Silva, Paulo Roberto; Cauvi, David M; Coto, Amanda L S; Kiraly, Vanessa T R; Borges, Júlio C; De Maio, Antonio",Cell Stress Chaperones,30,24

Thus, we speculated that emodin may possess anti-COVID-19 activity. In this study, using bioinformatics databases, we screened and harvested the candidate genes or targets of emodin and COVID-19 prior to the determination of pharmacological targets and molecular mechanisms of emodin against COVID-19. We discovered core targets for the treatment of COVID-19, including mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), tumor protein (TP53), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), caspase-3 (CASP3), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), interleukin 1B (IL1B), mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), B-cell lymphoma-2-like protein 1 (BCL2L1), interleukin-8 (CXCL8), myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1), and colony stimulating factor 2 (CSF2). The GO analysis of emodin against COVID-19 mainly included cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, response to lipopolysaccharide, response to molecule of bacterial origin, developmental process involved in reproduction, and reproductive structure development. The KEGG results exhibited that the molecular pathways mainly included IL-17 signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, TNF signaling pathway, pertussis, proteoglycans in cancer, pathways in cancer, MAPK signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, etc. Also, molecular docking results revealed the docking capability between emodin and COVID-19 and the potential pharmacological activity of emodin against COVID-19. Taken together, these findings uncovered the targets and pharmacological mechanisms of emodin for treating COVID-19 and suggested that the vital targets might be used as biomarkers against COVID-19.","Du, Hai-Xia; Zhu, Jia-Qi; Chen, Jing; Zhou, Hui-Fen; Yang, Jie-Hong; Wan, Hai-Tong",Aging (Albany NY),30,26

Excessive nitric oxide (NO) is a fundamental reason for breaking the Blood-Brain/Testi Barrier. Nitric oxide often relates the spread or replication of many viruses in the body. The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) that synthesizes NO in the human by binding heme to complete the oxygenase reaction. This study focused on the relationship between heme, NO, and the novel coronavirus using bioinformatics methods such as domain search and molecular docking. The results showed ORF8 had three domains similar to nitric oxide synthase : oxygenase, reductase, and calmodulin (CaM). ORF6 could bind to these three domains. The dimer of ORF8 was identical to the dimer of NOS enzyme. The oxygenase domain was in the core, and the reductase domain was on both sides. ORF8 could capture Heme, H4B, L-arginine, FAD, FMN, and NADPH, and bind with CaM protein to catalyze NO production. The heme bound by ORF8 mainly came from the attacked hemoglobin. ORF8 also attached to E protein and synthesized NO through the heme hunted by E protein. We believed NO synthesized by ORF8 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 from reinfecting infected cells and controlled the virus replication speed to avoid cell collapse because of exhaustion of resources. After the SARS-CoV-2 virus combined with an extensive ORF8, the produced NO stream permeably expanded blood vessels and broke the blood-brain/testi barrier. The SARS-CoV-2 virus spread to nearby tissues through small blood vessel holes created by NO stream. It would increase the tendency to bleed and the blood clotting of the tissue: blood clotting and viral infections severely damaged organs such as the respiratory, heart, nerve, reproductive. Short NO could not open vascular permeability dilation, causing high viral load in asymptomatic patients' blood. Excessive NO stimulated the reproductive organs and generated abnormal functions. It also made abnormal hormone regulation, such as excessive secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH). Much LH would hurt the reproductive organs, leading to infertility. Extreme NO also interfered with the human NO signaling pathway and damaged the immune nerve, metabolism, cardiovascular and other systems. This theory is for academic discussion only. We hope that this discovery will help block the virus’s transmission through the human circulatory system and help reproductive health management during the pandemic.","liu, wenzhong Li hualan",,30,12

Pediatric providers have reported a high number of patients without comorbidities presenting with hemorrhagic strokes associated with COVID-19. We present a study analyzing the factors associated with mortality in this setting. METHODS: Prospective case-control study that included patients <17 years old admitted to a pediatric critical care unit with a positive test confirming COVID-19. The primary outcome was mortality. Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used for the analysis. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were admitted to critical care. The mortality of our study is 21.3%. The mortality of patients with neurological presentation was 45.5%, which was significantly higher than the mortality of acute COVID-19 (26.7%) and MIS-C (4.8%), p 0.18. Other risk factors for mortality in our cohort were strokes and comorbidities. Only one patient presenting with hemorrhagic stroke had an undiagnosed comorbidity. CONCLUSION: Cerebrovascular events associated with COVID-19 in pediatric patients, including infants, must be recognized as one of the more severe presentations of this infection in pediatric patients. IMPACT: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 can present with hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes on presentation. Neurological presentation in pediatric patients with COVID-19 has high mortality. Mortality of pediatric patients with COVID-19 is associated with comorbidities.

The numbers of cases and deaths have increased on a daily basis on the scale of a global pandemic. Chest X-ray images have proven useful for monitoring various lung diseases and have recently been used to monitor the COVID-19 disease. In this paper, deep-learning-based approaches, namely deep feature extraction, fine-tuning of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNN), and end-to-end training of a developed CNN model, have been used in order to classify COVID-19 and normal (healthy) chest X-ray images. For deep feature extraction, pretrained deep CNN models (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, and VGG19) were used. For classification of the deep features, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier was used with various kernel functions, namely Linear, Quadratic, Cubic, and Gaussian. The aforementioned pretrained deep CNN models were also used for the fine-tuning procedure. A new CNN model is proposed in this study with end-to-end training. A dataset containing 180 COVID-19 and 200 normal (healthy) chest X-ray images was used in the study's experimentation. Classification accuracy was used as the performance measurement of the study. The experimental works reveal that deep learning shows potential in the detection of COVID-19 based on chest X-ray images. The deep features extracted from the ResNet50 model and SVM classifier with the Linear kernel function produced a 94.7% accuracy score, which was the highest among all the obtained results. The achievement of the fine-tuned ResNet50 model was found to be 92.6%, whilst end-to-end training of the developed CNN model produced a 91.6% result. Various local texture descriptors and SVM classifications were also used for performance comparison with alternative deep approaches; the results of which showed the deep approaches to be quite efficient when compared to the local texture descriptors in the detection of COVID-19 based on chest X-ray images.","Ismael, Aras M; Sengür, Abdulkadir",Expert Syst Appl,30,17

Although based on a relatively simple principle, its complex interaction with the cardiovascular system remains challenging and open to debate. The aim of this work was focused on the development of a new numerical model of IABP. METHODS: The new model was implemented in CARDIOSIM©, which is a modular software simulator of the cardiovascular system used in research and e-learning environment. The IABP is inserted into the systemic bed divided in aortic, thoracic and two abdominal tracts modelled with resistances, inertances and compliances. The effect induced by the balloon is reproduced in each tract of the aorta by the presence of compliances connected to PIABP generator and resistances. PIABP generator reproduces the balloon pressure with the option to change IABP timing. We have used literature data to validate the potential of this new numerical model. RESULTS: The results have shown that our simulations reproduced the typical effects induced during IABP assistance. We have also simulated the effects induced by the device on the hemodynamic variables when the IABP ratio was set to 1:1, 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8. The outcome of these simulations is in accordance with literature data measured in the clinical environment. CONCLUSIONS: The new IABP module is easy to manage and can be used as a training tool in a clinical setting. Although based on literature data, the outcome of the simulations is encouraging. Additional work is ongoing with a view to further validate its features. The configuration of CARDIOSIM© presented in this work allows the simulation of the effects induced by mechanical ventilatory assistance. This facility may have significant importance in the management of patients affected by COVID-19 when they require mechanical circulatory support devices.","De Lazzari, Claudio; De Lazzari, Beatrice; Iacovoni, Attilio; Marconi, Silvia; Papa, Silvia; Capoccia, Massimo; Badagliacca, Roberto; Vizza, Carmine Dario",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,30,22

While the disease epidemic could affect population mental health, this study aimed to investigate stress, anxiety, and depression during the Corona pandemic in Iran. METHODS: An online survey was designed using the depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) questionnaire. The questionnaire was available for all Iranian population from 18 to 28 April 2020. Finally, 1498 participants filled the questionnaire using snowball sampling. Data were analyzed using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: Findings showed that most participants had experienced a normal level of stress (36.6%), anxiety (57.9%) and depression (47.9%). About 2.5% of respondents report an extremely severe level of stress. This amount of anxiety and depression was 6.3 and 7.9%, respectively. Regression model showed being female (CI: - 1.299; - 0.248), living with a high risk family member (CI: 0.325; 1.400), health status (CI: - 0.857; - 0.595), economic status (CI: - 0.396; - 0.141), social capital (CI: - 0.475; - 0.244), risk of disease (CI: 0.081; 0.729), and following COVID-19 news (CI: 0.111; 0.551) have a relation with stress level.

Regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is associated with improved mental well-being, reduced likelihood of developing mental illness, and improved symptom management. Despite these benefits, most people fail to achieve minimum recommended levels of MVPA. Population levels of physical activity have further declined since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and implementation of public health measures (e.g., shelter-in-place protocols). The potential impact of this decline on mental heath outcomes warrants ongoing investigation. Purpose: To investigate associations between changes in MVPA and mental health (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and life satisfaction) in adults impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Research followed a cross-sectional design. English-speaking adults were invited to complete an online questionnaire. MVPA was assessed retrospectively (before COVID-19) and currently (during COVID-19) with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Mental health was assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire, 9-Item (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder, 7-Item (GAD-7), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Regression was used to assess relationships between MVPA and mental health. ANOVA with follow-up tests examined whether participants who differed in mental health status (e.g., no symptoms vs. severe symptoms) differed in their change in MVPA. T-tests were used to examine differences in mental health symptomatology between participants who were sufficiently (i.e., achieving MVPA guidelines of &#8805; 150 min/week) vs. insufficiently active. Results: Prior to COVID-19, 68.2% of participants were classified as being sufficiently active, vs. 60.6% during COVID-19. The majority of participants reported experiencing some level of depressive symptoms (62.0%) or anxiety symptoms (53.7%). After controlling for covariates, changes in MVPA accounted for significant variability in the PHQ-9 (7.7%), GAD-7 (2.5%), and SWLS (1.5 %). Participants with clinically significant mental health symptomatology reported greater declines in MVPA than those who reported no symptoms. Conversely, participants who were sufficiently active during COVID-19 reported significantly lower depression and anxiety, and higher life satisfaction. Conclusion: Participants who experienced the greatest declines in MVPA reported relatively greater psychological distress and lower life satisfaction. While preliminary, these findings suggest the importance of maintaining and promoting physical activity during a period of pandemic.","Gierc, Madelaine; Riazi, Negin A; Fagan, Matthew James; Di Sebastiano, Katie M; Kandola, Mahabhir; Priebe, Carly S; Weatherson, Katie A; Wunderlich, Kelly B; Faulkner, Guy",Front Public Health,30,21

MethodsA random sample of adolescents, aged 14-17 years, and their families was invited to a serosurvey in November and December 2020. Adolescents HRQoL was evaluated using the validated adolescent-reported KIDSCREEN-10 and parent-reported KINDL(R) scales. Psychological distress was assessed with self-reported sadness and loneliness, and using the KINDL(R) emotional well-being scale. Risk factors for adolescents low HRQoL and psychological distress were identified using generalized estimating equations and both adolescents and their parents perceptions were compared. ResultsAmong 240 adolescents, 11% had a low HRQoL, 35% reported sadness and 23% reported loneliness. Based on parents perception, 12% of the adolescents had a low HRQoL and 16% a low emotional well-being. Being a girl (aOR=3.29; 95%CI: 1.64-6.57), increased time on social media (aOR=2.05; 95%CI: 1.08-3.88), parents average to poor mood (aOR=2.81; 95%CI: 1.21-6.56) and average to poor household financial situation (aOR=2.30; 95%CI: 1.00-5.29) were associated with an increased risk of sadness. Mismatches between adolescents and their parents perception of HRQoL were more likely for girls (aOR=2.88; 95%CI: 1.54-5.41) and in households with lower family well-being (aOR=0.91; 95%CI: 0.86-0.96).

The COVID-19 pandemic is a testing experience for contemporary liberal democracies and their underlying governance paradigm. The article concentrates on three main issues. First, it explores how the crisis challenged authorities and their ability to sustain an overarching societal agenda, a normative horizon of governance, in view of an uncertain future. Second, it focuses on the driving logic of governance mechanisms and problematizes the preoccupation with the management of effects when dealing with social problems. Last but not least, it points to two particular dangers for democracy that emerge from the failures of the current governance paradigm in the face of the pandemic: legitimizing the imbalance of powers and normalizing social distance as the new crystal lattice of public and social interaction.","Nikolova, Blagovesta",Society,30,1

In this study, we enrolled 71 confirmed cases of COVID-19 who were discharged from hospital and transferred to isolation wards from 6 February to 26 March 2020. They were all employees of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University or their family members of which three cases were <18 years of age. Clinical data were collected and analysed statistically. Forty-one cases (41/71, 57.7%) comprised medical faculty, young and middle-aged patients (aged â©½60 years) accounted for 81.7% (58/71). The average isolation time period for all adult patients was 13.8 ± 6.1 days. During convalescence, RNA detection results of 35.2% patients (25/71) turned from negative to positive. The longest RNA reversed phase time was 7 days. In all, 52.9% of adult patients (36/68) had no obvious clinical symptoms, and the remaining ones had mild and non-specific clinical symptoms (e.g. cough, sputum, sore throat, disorders of the gastrointestinal tract etc.). Chest CT signs in 89.7% of adult patients (61/68) gradually improved, and in the others, the lesions were eventually absorbed and improved after short-term repeated progression. The main chest CT manifestations of adult patients were normal, GGO or fibre streak shadow, and six patients (8.8%) had extrapulmonary manifestations, but there was no significant correlation with RNA detection results (r = -0.008, P > 0.05). The drug treatment was mainly symptomatic support therapy, and antibiotics and antiviral drugs were ineffective. It is necessary to re-evaluate the isolation time and standard to terminate isolation for discharged COVID-19 patients.","Liu, B M; Yang, Q Q; Zhao, L Y; Xie, W; Si, X Y",Epidemiol Infect,30,16

Those explanations are based on the assumption that women take on the majority of childcare responsibilities, and take the same level of leave at the birth of a child. Changing social dynamics around parenting has seen fathers increasingly take an active role in parenting. This demands a more nuanced approach to understanding how parenting affects both men and women. Using a global survey of 11,226 academic parents, this study investigates the effect of parental engagement (Lead, Dual (shared), and Satellite parenting), and partner type, on measures of research productivity and impact for men and for women. It also analyzes the effect of different levels of parental leave on academic productivity. Results show that the parenting penalty for men and women is a function of the level of engagement in parenting activities. Men who serve in lead roles suffer similar penalties, but women are more likely to serve in lead parenting roles and to be more engaged across time and tasks. Taking a period of parental leave is associated with higher levels of productivity, however the productivity advantage is lost for the US-sample at 6 months, and at 12-months for the non-US sample. These results suggest that parental engagement is a more powerful variable to explain gender differences in academic productivity than the mere existence of children, and that policies should that factor into account.","G.E., Derrick; P-Y., Chen; vanLeeuwen, T.; Lariviere, V.; C.R, Sugimoto",,30,16

Given recent increased emphasis on airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the purpose of the present study was to experimentally characterize aerosol dispersion within olfactory epithelium (OE) and respiratory epithelium (RE) in human subjects, to determine if small (sub 5µm) airborne aerosols selectively deposit in the OE. METHODS: Healthy adult volunteers inhaled fluorescein-labeled nebulized 0.5-5µm airborne aerosol or atomized larger aerosolized droplets (30-100µm). Particulate deposition in the OE and RE was assessed by blue-light filter modified rigid endoscopic evaluation with subsequent image randomization, processing and quantification by a blinded reviewer. RESULTS: 0.5-5µm airborne aerosol deposition, as assessed by fluorescence gray value, was significantly higher in the OE than the RE bilaterally, with minimal to no deposition observed in the RE (maximum fluorescence: OE 19.5(IQR 22.5), RE 1(IQR 3.2), p<0.001; average fluorescence: OE 2.3(IQR 4.5), RE 0.1(IQR 0.2), p<0.01). Conversely, larger 30-100µm aerosolized droplet deposition was significantly greater in the RE than the OE (maximum fluorescence: OE 13(IQR 14.3), RE 38(IQR 45.5), p<0.01; average fluorescence: OE 1.9(IQR 2.1), RE 5.9(IQR 5.9), p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data experimentally confirm that despite bypassing the majority of the upper airway, small-sized (0.5-5µm) airborne aerosols differentially deposit in significant concentrations within the olfactory epithelium. This provides a compelling aerodynamic mechanism to explain atypical OD in COVID-19.","Workman, Alan D; Jafari, Aria; Xiao, Roy; Bleier, Benjamin S",PLoS One,30,33

In patients with cirrhosis with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), new onset organ failures manifesting as acute-on-chronic liver failure have also been reported. The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) also directly binds to enterocytes and cholangiocytes via the angiotensin converting enzyme receptor 2, although the lung remains the portal of entry. Superadded with the COVID-19 related bystander hepatitis, a systemic inflammatory response is noted due to unregulated macrophage activation syndrome and cytokine storm. However, the exact definition and diagnostic criteria of the 'cytokine storm' in COVID-19 are yet unclear. In addition, inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimer and procalcitonin are frequently elevated. This in turn leads to disease progression, activation of the coagulation cascade, vascular microthrombi and immune-mediated injury in different organ systems. Deranged liver chemistries are also noted due to the cytokine storm, and synergistic hypoxic or ischemic liver injury, drug-induced liver injury, and use of hepatotoxic antiviral agents all contribute to deranged liver chemistry. Control of an unregulated cytokine storm at an early stage may avert disease morbidity and mortality.

Moreover, the high-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics are contingent on an RNA extraction step, which, in turn, is restricted by constraints in the supply chain. Here, we present CASSPIT (Cas13 Assisted Saliva-based & Smartphone Integrated Testing), which will allow direct use of saliva samples without the need for an extra RNA extraction step for SARS-CoV-2 detection. CASSPIT utilizes CRISPR-Cas13a based SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, and lateral-flow assay (LFA) readout of the test results. The sample preparation workflow includes an optimized chemical treatment and heat inactivation method, which, when applied to COVID-19 clinical samples, showed a 97% positive agreement with the RNA extraction method. With CASSPIT, LFA based visual limit of detection (LoD) for a given SARS-CoV-2 RNA spiked into the saliva samples was ~200 copies; image analysis-based quantification further improved the analytical sensitivity to ~100 copies. Upon validation of clinical sensitivity on RNA extraction-free saliva samples (n = 76), a 98% agreement between the lateral-flow readout and RT-qPCR data was found (Ct<35). To enable user-friendly test results with provision for data storage and online consultation, we subsequently integrated lateral-flow strips with a smartphone application. We believe CASSPIT will eliminate our reliance on RT-qPCR by providing comparable sensitivity and will be a step toward establishing nucleic acid-based point-of-care (POC) testing for COVID-19.","Azmi, Iqbal; Faizan, Md Imam; Kumar, Rohit; Raj Yadav, Siddharth; Chaudhary, Nisha; Kumar Singh, Deepak; Butola, Ruchika; Ganotra, Aryan; Datt Joshi, Gopal; Deep Jhingan, Gagan; Iqbal, Jawed; Joshi, Mohan C; Ahmad, Tanveer",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,30,27

METHODS: A survey was disseminated amongst SIU members worldwide by email. Results were analyzed to examine the influence of age, practice region and settings on continuing medical education (CME) of the respondents. RESULTS: In total, 2494 respondents completed the survey. Internet searching was the most common method of CME (76%; all ps < 0.001), followed by searching journals and textbook including the online versions (62%; all ps < 0.001). Overall, 6% of the respondents reported no time/interest for CME during the pandemic.

The report raises concerns on the use of SARS-CoV-2 kits in malaria areas in terms of cost, to prompt research, allay fears and guide policy during this pandemic and beyond.","Kusotera, Tapiwanashe; Nhengu, Trust G",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,30,1

This disease is one of the most important infectious diseases in cats, and it is associated with high mortality, particularly among younger cats. In this study, we isolated a wild-type FIPV HRB-17 epidemic strain from the blood sample of household pet cat exhibiting the characteristic wet-form FIP symptoms, which has been confirmed further by animal infection. Further, we developed an EvaGreen-based real-time RT-PCR assay for the accurate detection of FCoV based on the amplification of the highly conserved FIPV N gene. Then, using a combination of the real-time RT-PCR approach and a serum chemistry assay, we performed an epidemiological survey of FIPV infection in cats living in Harbin City, Northeast China. The results indicated that the EvaGreen-based real-time RT-PCR assay can be used for screening FCoV infection in the affected cats at an analytical detection limit of 8.2 × 101 viral genome copies/µL, but could not effectively distinguish FIPVs from FECVs. Additionally, the results of the epidemiological survey investigating feline blood samples (n = 1523) collected between July 2017 to July 2019 revealed an FIPV prevalence of approximately 12% (189/1523). Maybe, the prevalence would be less than 12% due to the real-time RT-PCR assay could not accurately differentiate FIPV and FECV. Nevertheless, it still highlighted the severity of the FIP epidemic in cats and reiterated the urgent need to develop effective anti-FIP therapeutic agents and anti-FIPV vaccines. As pet cats are household animals, risk communication and continuous region-extended surveillance cat programs are recommended.","Guan, Xueting; Li, Hua; Han, Meijing; Jia, Shuo; Feng, Baohua; Gao, Xuwen; Wang, Zhuo; Jiang, Yanping; Cui, Wen; Wang, Li; Xu, Yigang",Mol Cell Probes,30,16

METHODS: Forty extracted intact human first premolars were imaged with micro-CT and randomly assigned to the contracted endodontic cavity (CEC) or traditional endodontic cavity (TEC) groups. CEC was prepared with the aid of a 3D-printed template, canals were prepared with a 0.04 taper M-Two rotary instrument, and cavities were restored with resin. Specimens were loaded to fracture in an Instron Universal Testing Machine after a fatigue phase. The data were analyzed by the independent samples T test and Mann-Whitney U test, appropriate post hoc tests. RESULTS: In the premolars tested in vitro, the percentage of dentin removed in the premolars with two dental roots in the CEC group (3.85% ± 0.42%) was significantly smaller (P < 0.05) than in the TEC group (4.94% ± 0.5%). The untouched canal wall (UCW) after instrumentation for TECs (16.43% ± 6.56%) was significantly lower (P < .05) than the UCW (24.42% ± 9.19%) for CECs in single-rooted premolars. No significant differences were observed in the increased canal volume and surface areas in premolars between the TEC and CEC groups (P > 0.05). CECs conserved coronal dentin in premolars with two dental roots but no impact on the instrument efficacy. There were no differences between the CEC groups and the TEC groups in the percentage of filling material and voids (P > 0.05). In addition, the mean load at failure of premolars did not significantly differ between the CEC and TEC groups and there was no significant difference in the type of fracture (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that CEC could not improve the fracture resistance of the endodontically treated premolars. The instrumentation efficacy and the percentage of filling material did not significantly differ between CECs and TECs in premolars.","Xia, Juan; Wang, Weidong; Li, Zhengmao; Lin, Bingpeng; Zhang, Qian; Jiang, Qianzhou; Yang, Xuechao",BMC Oral Health,30,1

AIMS: We aimed at registering endoscopic abnormalities and potentially associated risk factors among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: All consecutive patients with COVID-19 undergoing endoscopy in 16 institutions from high-prevalence regions were enrolled. Mann-Whitney U, &#967;2 or Fisher's exact test were used to compare patients with major abnormalities to those with negative procedures, and multivariate logistic regression to identify independent predictors. RESULTS: Between February and May 2020, during the first pandemic outbreak with severely restricted endoscopy activity, 114 endoscopies on 106 patients with COVID-19 were performed in 16 institutions (men=70.8%, median age=68 (58-74); 33% admitted in intensive care unit; 44.4% reporting GI symptoms). 66.7% endoscopies were urgent, mainly for overt GI bleeding. 52 (45.6%) patients had major abnormalities, whereas 13 bled from previous conditions. The most prevalent upper GI abnormalities were ulcers (25.3%), erosive/ulcerative gastro-duodenopathy (16.1%) and petechial/haemorrhagic gastropathy (9.2%). Among lower GI endoscopies, 33.3% showed an ischaemic-like colitis.Receiver operating curve analysis identified D-dimers >1850 ng/mL as predicting major abnormalities. Only D-dimers >1850 ng/mL (OR=12.12 (1.69-86.87)) and presence of GI symptoms (OR=6.17 (1.13-33.67)) were independently associated with major abnormalities at multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: In this highly selected cohort of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 requiring endoscopy, almost half showed acute mucosal injuries and more than one-third of lower GI endoscopies had features of ischaemic colitis. Among the hospitalisation-related and patient-related variables evaluated in this study, D-dimers above 1850 ng/mL was the most useful at predicting major mucosal abnormalities at endoscopy.

We report three patients with critical respiratory failure due to Covid-19, in which all presented with severe hypoxemia refractory to supplemental oxygen therapy. We discuss possible strategies for ventilatory support in the emergency pre-hospital setting, and point out some pitfalls regarding the management of these patients. Guidelines for pre-hospital care of critically ill Covid-19 patients cannot be established based on the current evidence base, and we have to apply our understanding of respiratory physiology and mechanics in order to optimize respiratory support. METHODS: Three cases with similar clinical presentation were identified within the Norwegian national helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) system. The HEMS units are manned by a consultant anaesthesiologist. Patient's next of kin and the Regional committee for medical and health research ethics approved the publication of this report. CONCLUSION: Patients with Covid-19 and severe hypoxemia may pose a considerable challenge for the pre-hospital emergency medical services. Intubation may be associated with a high risk of complications in these patients and should be carried out with diligence when considered necessary. The following interventions are worth considering in Covid-19 patients with refractory hypoxemia before proceeding to intubation. First, administering oxygen via a tight fitting BVM with an oxygen flow rate that exceeds the patient's ventilatory minute volume. Second, applying continuous positive airway pressure, while simultaneously maintaining a high FiO2. Finally, assuming the patient is cooperative, repositioning to prone position.","Mæhlen, Jens Otto; Mikalsen, Roger; Heimdal, Hans Julius; Rehn, Marius; Hagemo, Jostein S; Ottestad, William",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,30,17

Indeed, quality management is an especially important aspect and has achieved great milestones during the development of clinical laboratories. CURRENT STATUS: However, since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a threat worldwide, previous management mode inside the separate laboratory could not cater to the demand of the COVID-19 public health emergency. Among emerging new issues, the prominent challenges during the period of COVID-19 pandemic are rapid-launched laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) for urgent clinical application, rapid expansion of testing capabilities, laboratory medicine resources, and personnel shortages. These related issues are now impacting on clinical laboratory and need to be effectively addressed. CONCLUSION: Different from traditional views of laboratory medicine management that focus on separate laboratories, present clinical laboratory management must be multidimensional mode which should consider consolidation of the efficient network of regional clinical laboratories and reasonable planning of laboratories resources from the view of overall strategy. Based on relevant research and our experience, in this review, we retrospect the history trajectory of laboratory medicine management, and also, we provide existing and other feasible recommended management strategies for laboratory medicine in future.","Luo, YunTao; Wang, JingHua; Zhang, MinMin; Wang, QingZhong; Chen, Rong; Wang, XueLiang; Wang, HuaLiang",J Clin Lab Anal,30,20

The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 and quickly spread to over 200 countries. It has affected 4,258,666 people, with 294,190 deaths worldwide by May 15, 2020. COVID-19 is characterized by acute respiratory disease, with 80% of patients presenting mild like flu-like symptoms; however, 20% of patients may have a severe or critical clinical presentation, which likely causes multiple organ injuries (e.g., kidney, heart, blood, and nervous system). Among them, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a critical complication due to its high incidence and mortality rate. Here we present a review of the current understanding of AKI in COVID-19. Summary: CO-VID-19 is a catastrophic contagious disease caused by the coronavirus, and the AKI induced by COVID-19 significantly increases the mortality rate. In this review, we summarize the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 induced AKI by focusing on its epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical diagnosis, and treatment. Key Messages: Multiple studies have shown that COVID-19 may involve the kidneys and cause AKI. This article reviews the characteristics of COVID-19-induced AKI largely based on up-to-date studies in the hope that it will be helpful in the current global fight against and treatment of COVID-19.","Qian, Jing-Yi; Wang, Bin; Liu, Bi-Cheng",Kidney Dis.,30,16

Current rural research reveals similar challenges, and strategies suggested for addressing rural-urban health disparities 100 years ago resonate today. This article examines rural public health literature from a century ago and its connections to contemporary rural health disparities.

Information on this life-threatening pandemic of COVID-19 is sparse and discrete; and the urgency is such that the dissemination of information is increasing with numerous daily publications on the topic. Therefore, we developed a comprehensive review on various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We scientifically compiled published research, news, and reports from various sources to comprehend and summarize the information and findings on Coronaviruses. The review explicitly covers the aspects like genome and pedigree of SARS-CoV-2; epidemiology, prognosis, pathogenesis, symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 in order to catalog the right information on transmission route, and influence of environmental factors on virus transmissions, for the robust understanding of right strategical steps for proper COVID-19 management. We have explicitly highlighted several useful information and facts like: i) No established relationship between progression of SARS-CoV-2 with temperature, humidity and/or both, ii) The underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood, iii) Respiratory droplet size determines drop and airborne-based transmission, iv) Prognosis of COVID-19 can be done by its effects on various body organs, v) Infection can be stopped by restricting the binding of S protein and AE2, vi) Hydroxychloroquine is believed to be better than chloroquine for COVID-19, vii) Ivermectin with Vero-hSLAM cells is able to reduce infection by ~5000 time within 2 days, and viii) Nafamostat mesylate can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated membrane fusion. We have also suggested future research perspectives, challenges and scope.","Kumar, Manish; Taki, Kaling; Gahlot, Rohit; Sharma, Ayushi; Dhangar, Kiran",Sci Total Environ,30,8

AIM: The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence and risk factors for AKI and mortality in children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) from a resource-limited setting. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of laboratory confirmed COVID19 children admitted from 1 March to 30 November 2020 in a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India was done. Clinical features and associated comorbidities of COVID19 were noted. Baseline serum creatinine (height-independent Hoste's equation) and peak serum creatinine were used for staging of AKI by the 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes serum creatinine criteria. Univariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to compare the overall outcome in the AKI vs. the non-AKI group. RESULTS: A total of 64 810 children between 1 month and 18 years visited the hospital; 3412 were tested for suspected COVID19, 295 tested positive and 105 (54% boys) were hospitalized. Twenty-four hospitalized children (22.8%) developed AKI; 8 in Stage 1 (33.3%), 7 in Stage 2 (29.2%) and 9 in Stage 3 (37.5%) respectively. Overall, three patients received KRT. Highest reported mortality was (66.6%) in AKI Stage 3. Risk factors for AKI included associated sepsis (OR 95% CI, 1.22-9.43, p < 0.01), nephrotic syndrome (OR 95% CI, 1.13-115.5, p < 0.01), vasopressor support (OR 3.59, 95% CI, 1.37-9.40, p value< 0.007), shock at presentation (OR 2.98, 95% CI, 1.16-7.60, p value 0.01) and mechanical ventilation (OR 2.64, 95% CI, 1.04-6.71, p value< 0.03). Mortality (25.71%) was higher in the AKI group (OR 95% CI, 1.14-8.35, p < 0.023) with shock (OR 45.92; 95% CI, 3.44-612.0, p value <0.004) and ventilation (OR 46.24; 95% CI, 1.6-1333.0 p value< 0.02) as significant risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: AKI is an important modifiable risk factor for mortality in children with COVID19 in a resource-limited setting. Our study supports the strengthening of kidney replacement therapy and its timely initiation to reduce the progression of AKI and thus mortality in children.","Chopra, Sanya; Saha, Abhijeet; Kumar, Virendra; Thakur, Archana; Pemde, Harish; Kapoor, Dipti; Ray, Sandip; Das, Aditi; Pandit, Kaveri; Gulati, Anu; Sharma, Ankita Goel; Singh, Preeti; Sodani, Ravitanya",J. trop. pedriatr,30,28

Here, we analyzed whether specific biomarkers predict the clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 2147 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection which were included in the Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV­2 (LEOSS)-registry from March to June 2020. Clinical data and laboratory values were collected and compared between patients with and without cardiovascular comorbidities in different clinical stages of the disease. Predictors for mortality were calculated using multivariate regression analysis. We show that patients with cardiovascular comorbidities display significantly higher markers of myocardial injury and thrombo-inflammatory activation already in the uncomplicated phase of COVID-19. In multivariate analysis, elevated levels of troponin [OR 1.54; (95% CI 1.22-1.96), p < 0.001)], IL-6 [OR 1.69 (95% CI 1.26-2.27), p < 0.013)], and CRP [OR 1.32; (95% CI 1.1-1.58), p < 0.003)] were predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities show elevated markers of thrombo-inflammatory activation and myocardial injury, which predict mortality, already in the uncomplicated phase of COVID-19. Starting targeted anti-inflammatory therapy and aggressive anticoagulation already in the uncomplicated phase of the disease might improve outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities.

Among several results, we find positive and economically meaningful spillovers from falling oil prices to both renewable energy and coal markets. However, this result is only found for the narrow portion of our sample surrounding the negative WTI event. We interpret our results being directly attributed to a sharp drop in global oil, gas and coal demand, rather than because of a sudden increase in oil supply. While investors observed the US fracking industry losing market share to coal, they also viewed renewables as more reliable mechanism to generate long-term, stable and low-cost supply.","Corbet, Shaen; Goodell, John W; Günay, Samet",Energy Econ,30,29

We assessed the relative contributions of shape and texture metrics separately and together in the prediction model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computed tomography (CT) images of 735 patients with 539 malignant and 196 benign masses were segmented in this retrospective study. Thirty-three shape and 760 texture metrics were calculated per tumor. Tumor classification models using shape, texture, and both metrics were built using random forest and AdaBoost with tenfold cross-validation. Sensitivity analyses on five sub-cohorts with respect to the acquisition phase were conducted. Additional sensitivity analyses after multiple imputation were also conducted. Model performance was assessed using AUC. RESULTS: Random forest classifier showed shape metrics featuring within the top 10% performing metrics regardless of phase, attaining the highest variable importance in the corticomedullary phase. Convex hull perimeter ratio is a consistently high-performing shape feature. Shape metrics alone achieved an AUC ranging 0.64-0.68 across multiple classifiers, compared with 0.67-0.75 and 0.68-0.75 achieved by texture-only and combined models, respectively. CONCLUSION: Shape metrics alone attain high prediction performance and high variable importance in the combined model, while being independent of the acquisition phase (unlike texture). Shape analysis therefore should not be overlooked in its potential to distinguish benign from malignant tumors, and future radiomics platforms powered by machine learning should harness both shape and texture metrics. KEY POINTS: â¢ Current radiomics research is heavily weighted towards texture analysis, but quantitative shape metrics should not be ignored in their potential to distinguish benign from malignant renal tumors. â¢ Shape metrics alone can attain high prediction performance and demonstrate high variable importance in the combined shape and texture radiomics model. â¢ Any future radiomics platform powered by machine learning should harness both shape and texture metrics, especially since tumor shape (unlike texture) is independent of the acquisition phase and more robust from the imaging variations.","Yap, Felix Y; Varghese, Bino A; Cen, Steven Y; Hwang, Darryl H; Lei, Xiaomeng; Desai, Bhushan; Lau, Christopher; Yang, Lindsay L; Fullenkamp, Austin J; Hajian, Simin; Rivas, Marielena; Gupta, Megha Nayyar; Quinn, Brian D; Aron, Manju; Desai, Mihir M; Aron, Monish; Oberai, Assad A; Gill, Inderbir S; Duddalwar, Vinay A",Eur. radiol,30,24

In this article, we describe the sequence of pathological changes in COVID-19 and discuss the implications for approaches to treatment. METHODS: Standardized autopsies were performed on thirteen patients who had died of COVID-19. The findings were analyzed together with clinical data from the patients' medical records. RESULTS: Most (77%) of the deceased patients were men. Their median age at death was 78 years (range, 41-90). Most of them had major pre-existing chronic diseases, most commonly arterial hypertension. The autopsies revealed characteristic COVID-19-induced pathological changes in the lungs, which were regarded as the cause of death in most patients. The main histological finding was sequential alveolar damage, apparently due in large measure to focal capillary microthrombus formation. Alveolar damage leads to the death of the patient either directly or by the induction of pulmonary parenchymal fibrosis. Diffuse lung damage was seen exclusively in invasively ventilated patients. CONCLUSION: Autopsies are crucial for the systematic assessment of new diseases such as COVID-19: they provide a basis for further investigations of disease mechanisms and for the devising of potentially effective modes of treatment. The autopsy findings suggest that focal damage of the microvascular pulmonary circulation is a main mechanism of lethal lung disease due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It may also be a cause of persistent lung damage in patients who recover from severe COVID-19.","Kommoss, Felix K F; Schwab, Constantin; Tavernar, Luca; Schreck, Johannes; Wagner, Willi L; Merle, Uta; Jonigk, Danny; Schirmacher, Peter; Longerich, Thomas",Dtsch Arztebl Int,30,1

During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, it was especially important to save operating room resources and to have a shorter ICU stay for patients, when ICUs had insufficient beds. In this context of limited resources, early percutaneous tracheostomy could be an effective way to manage mechanically ventilated patients. Nevertheless, current recommendations suggest delaying or avoiding the tracheotomy in coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Aim of the study was to analyze the hospital mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 patients who had received early percutaneous tracheostomy and factors associated with removal of tracheostomy cannula at ICU discharge. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Coronavirus disease 2019 ICU. PATIENTS: Adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 3 days after ICU admission. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Three days after ICU admission, 164 patients were present in ICU and included in the analysis. One-hundred and twenty-one patients (74%) were tracheostomized, whereas the other 43 (26%) were managed with translaryngeal intubation only. In multivariable analysis, early percutaneous tracheostomy was associated with lower hospital mortality. Sixty-six of tracheostomized patients (55%) were discharged alive from the hospital. Age and male sex were the only characteristics that were independently associated with mortality in the tracheostomized patients (45.5% and 62.8% in tracheostomized and nontracheostomized patients, respectively; p = 0.009). Tracheostomy tube was removed in 47 of the tracheostomized patients (71%). The only variable independently associated with weaning from tracheostomy at ICU discharge was a faster start of spontaneous breathing after tracheotomy was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Early percutaneous tracheostomy was safe and effective in coronavirus disease 2019 patients, giving a good chance of survival and of weaning from tracheostomy cannula at ICU discharge.","Rosano, Antonio; Martinelli, Enrico; Fusina, Federica; Albani, Filippo; Caserta, Rosalba; Morandi, Alessandro; Dell039,; Agnolo, Piera; Dicembrini, Alessandra; Mansouri, Leila; Marchini, Andrea; Schivalocchi, Valeria; Natalini, Giuseppe",Crit. care med,30,30

This article describes the first 2226 adult patients with COVID-19, consecutively admitted to La Paz University Hospital in Madrid. Methods: Our cohort included all patients consecutively hospitalized who had a final outcome (death or discharge) in a 1286-bed hospital of Madrid (Spain) from 25 February (first case admitted) to 19 April 2020. The data were manually entered into an electronic case report form, which was monitored prior to the analysis. Results: We consecutively included 2226 adult patients admitted to the hospital who either died (460) or were discharged (1766). The patients’ median age was 61 years, and 51.8% were women. The most common comorbidity was arterial hypertension (41.3%), and the most common symptom on admission was fever (71.2%). The median time from disease onset to hospital admission was 6 days. The overall mortality was 20.7% and was higher in men (26.6% vs. 15.1%). Seventy-five patients with a final outcome were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) (3.4%). Most patients admitted to the ICU were men, and the median age was 64 years. Baseline laboratory values on admission were consistent with an impaired immune-inflammatory profile. Conclusions: We provide a description of the first large cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Europe. Advanced age, male sex, the presence of comorbidities and abnormal laboratory values were more common among the patients with fatal outcomes.","Borobia, Alberto M.; Carcas, Antonio J.; Arnalich, Francisco; Álvarez-Sala, Rodolfo; Monserrat-Villatoro, Jaime; Quintana, Manuel; Figueira, Juan Carlos; Torres Santos-Olmo, Rosario M.; García-Rodríguez, Julio; Martín-Vega, Alberto; Buño, Antonio; Ramírez, Elena; Martínez-Alés, Gonzalo; García-Arenzana, Nicolás; Concepción Núñez, M.; Martí-De-Gracia, Milagros; Ramos, Francisco Moreno; Reinoso-Barbero, Francisco; Martin-Quiros, Alejandro; Núñez, Angélica Rivera; Mingorance, Jesús; Carpio Segura, Carlos J.; Arribas, Daniel Prieto; Cuevas, Esther Rey; Sánchez, Concepción Prados; Rios, Juan J.; Hernán, Miguel A.; Frías, Jesús; Arribas, José R.",J.

This has been proposed with a double aim: (1) an in-depth verification of the analytical and clinical performances presented by the manufacturer and (2) an economy of scale in terms of centralized validation for all the laboratories using the tests subject to evaluation. Methods A retrospective validation study was conducted including the serum of 125 patients in order to determine the analytical and clinical performances of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 from DiaSorin® detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and to compare its clinical performance with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test from Euroimmun®, one of the first commercially available tests allowing the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG. Results The performances of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 satisfied all the acceptance criteria and provided ""real world"" analytical and clinical performances very close to the ones reported by the manufacturer in its insert kit. Comparison between the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 and the ELISA method did not reveal any difference between the two techniques in terms of sensitivities and specificities regarding the determination of the IgG. Conclusions This study reports the validation of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 allowing to detect IgG antibodies specifically directed against SARS-CoV-2. The analytical and clinical performances are excellent, and the automation of the test offers important rates, ideal for absorbing an extension of testing.","Tré-Hardy, Marie; Wilmet, Alain; Beukinga, Ingrid; Dogné, Jean-Michel; Douxfils, Jonathan; Blairon, Laurent",Clin Chem Lab Med,30,16

The urgency to deploy serological assays required rapid evaluation of their performance characteristics. We undertook an internal validation of a CE marked lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) (SureScreen Diagnostics) using serum from SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive individuals and pre-pandemic samples. This was followed by the delivery of a same-day named patient SARS-CoV-2 serology service using LFIA on vetted referrals at central London teaching hospital with clinical interpretation of result provided to the direct care team. Assay performance, source and nature of referrals, feasibility and clinical utility of the service, particularly benefit in clinical decision-making, were recorded. Sensitivity and specificity of LFIA were 96.1% and 99.3% respectively. 113 tests were performed on 108 participants during three-week pilot. 44% participants (n = 48) had detectable antibodies. Three main indications were identified for serological testing; new acute presentations potentially triggered by recent COVID-19 e.g. pulmonary embolism (n = 5), potential missed diagnoses in context of a recent COVID-19 compatible illness (n = 40), and making infection control or immunosuppression management decisions in persistently SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR positive individuals (n = 6). We demonstrate acceptable performance characteristics, feasibility and clinical utility of using a LFIA that detects anti-spike antibodies to deliver SARS-CoV-2 serology service in adults and children. Greatest benefit was seen where there is reasonable pre-test probability and results can be linked with clinical advice or intervention. Experience from this pilot can help inform practicalities and benefits of rapidly implementing new tests such as LFIAs into clinical service as the pandemic evolves.","Sweeney, Nicola; Merrick, Blair; Pedro Galão, Rui; Pickering, Suzanne; Botgros, Alina; Wilson, Harry D; Signell, Adrian W; Betancor, Gilberto; Tan, Mark Kia Ik; Ramble, John; Kouphou, Neophytos; Acors, Sam; Graham, Carl; Seow, Jeffrey; MacMahon, Eithne; Neil, Stuart J D; Malim, Michael H; Doores, Katie; Douthwaite, Sam; Batra, Rahul; Nebbia, Gaia; Edgeworth, Jonathan D",PLoS One,30,20

This study determines correlations between program reputation and social media activity and popularity, specifically among otolaryngology residency programs. METHODS: Accredited programs, excluding military and osteopathic, in the United States were included. Activity and popularity on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram were assessed during the same 7-month period from 2016 to 2020. Doximity Residency reputation scores (dividing programs into quartiles) and US News & World Report (comparing programs affiliated with top hospitals versus those with unranked hospitals) were utilized to compare differences based on reputation. RESULTS: Of 104 programs, 91 (88%) had social media accounts. Instagram and Twitter were more commonly used than Facebook, with 78 (75%), 49 (47%), and 42 (40%) accounts, respectively. The cumulative use of all three platforms grew yearly, while Twitter (R2 = 0.9863) and Instagram (R2 = 0.9955) presence increased exponentially. Doximity's top quartile programs had more Facebook (P = .020), Twitter (P < .001), and Instagram (P = .102) accounts. First-quartile programs also adopted each platform months before fourth-quartile programs. Stratified by US News & World Report, ranked programs had more social media accounts, with 24 (53%) on Facebook (P = .028), 32 (71%) on Twitter (P < .001), and 37 (82%) on Instagram (P = .155). Programs with higher reputations were more active and exhibited increased likes and followers over time. CONCLUSION: Social media use among otolaryngology programs has grown exponentially, with Instagram and Twitter becoming the dominant platforms. Higher ranked programs are more active on social media, have more followers, and adopt social media earlier.

We found significant two-way interactions between temporal frames and levels of uncertainty, such that consumers with high (vs. low) levels of uncertainty respond more favorably when a distal (vs. proximal) framed message is applied. The path from fluency to high-control coping explained the interaction effect between temporal framing and levels of uncertainty on behavioral outcomes toward experience goods. © Copyright © 2021, American Academy of Advertising.","Kim, H.

'Batesian'-type mimicry entails a conflict of interest between sender and receiver, reflected in a deceptive mimic signal. 'Müllerian'-type mimicry occurs when there is perfect common interest between sender and receiver in a particular type of encounter, manifested by an honest co-mimic signal. Using a signalling games approach, simulations show that invasion by Batesian mimics will make Müllerian mimicry unstable, in a coevolutionary chase. We use these results to better understand the deceptive strategies of SARS-CoV-2 and their key role in the COVID-19 pandemic. At the biomolecular level, we explain how cellularization promotes Müllerian molecular mimicry, and discourages Batesian molecular mimicry. A wide range of processes analogous to cellularization are presented; these might represent a manner of reducing oscillatory instabilities. Lastly, we identify examples of mimicry in human society that might be addressed using a signalling game approach.","Casey, William; Massey, Steven E; Mishra, Bud",J R Soc Interface,30,15

Prevalence of COVID-19 by sexes differs between countries. The trend in Spain shows an unequal pattern, initially more frequent in men, but women outnumbered them from March 31, after two weeks lockdown. Infections are more frequent in women than in men in close contact with probable/confirmed COVID-19 cases. Consistent with deaths in men, they are hospitalized more frequently than women: Significant gender differences in signs/symptoms can drive this pattern, already observed in other pathologies. In late April, excess mortality is the same in women (67%) than in men (66%). But, lack of exhaustive information on deaths from COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients may contribute to lower notification of deaths in women. Invisibility of data by sex and gender is probably affecting negatively women with COVID -19 more than men.","Ruiz Cantero, María Teresa","Gac. sanit. (Barc., Ed. impr.)",30,21

Herein, we report a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with intermittent viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive for &gt;4 months after clinical rehabilitation. A 35-year-old male was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia with fever but without other specific symptoms. The treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir, oxygen inhalation, and other symptomatic supportive treatment facilitated recovery, and the patient was discharged. However, his viral PCR test was continually positive in oropharyngeal swabs for &gt;4 months after that. At the end of June 2020, he was still under quarantine and observation. The contribution of current antivirus therapy might be limited. The prognosis of COVID-19 patients might be irrelevant to the virus status. Thus, further investigation to evaluate the contagiousness of convalescent patients and the mechanism underlying the persistent existence of SARS-CoV-2 after recovery is essential. A new strategy of disease control, especially extending the follow-up period for recovered COVID-19 patients, is necessary to adapt to the current situation of pandemic.","Li, Wenyuan Huang Beibei Shen Qiang Jiang Shouwei Jin Kun Ling Ning Liu Lei Li Lei",Open Medicine,30,16

Here, we tested the inhibitory activities of the antiviral interferons of type I (IFN-&#945;) and type III (IFN-&#955;) against SARS-CoV-2 and compared them with those against SARS-CoV-1, which emerged in 2003. Using two mammalian epithelial cell lines (human Calu-3 and simian Vero E6), we found that both IFNs dose-dependently inhibit SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, SARS-CoV-1 was restricted only by IFN-&#945; in these cell lines. SARS-CoV-2 generally exhibited a broader IFN sensitivity than SARS-CoV-1. Moreover, ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of IFN-triggered Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling, boosted SARS-CoV-2 replication in the IFN-competent Calu-3 cells. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to exogenously added IFNs. This finding suggests that type I and especially the less adverse effect-prone type III IFN are good candidates for the management of COVID-19.","Felgenhauer, Ulrike; Schoen, Andreas; Gad, Hans Henrik; Hartmann, Rune; Schaubmar, Andreas R; Failing, Klaus; Drosten, Christian; Weber, Friedemann",J Biol Chem,30,23

Spanish study,11.756727,8.7881565,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To model and compare effect of digital contact tracing versus shelter-in-place on severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread. METHODS: Using a classical epidemiologic framework and parameters estimated from literature published between February 1, 2020, and May 25, 2020, we modeled two non-pharmacologic interventions - shelter-in-place and digital contact tracing - to curb spread of SARS-CoV-2. For contact tracing, we assumed an advanced automated contact tracing (AACT) application that sends alerts to individuals advising self-isolation based on individual exposure profile. Model parameters included percentage population ordered to shelter-in-place, adoption rate of AACT, and percentage individuals who appropriately follow recommendations. Under influence of these variables, the number of individuals infected, exposed, and isolated were estimated. RESULTS: Without any intervention, a high rate of infection (>10 million) with early peak is predicted. Shelter-in-place results in rapid decline in infection rate at the expense of impacting a large population segment. The AACT model achieves reduction in infected and exposed individuals similar to shelter-in-place without impacting a large number of individuals. For example, a 50% AACT adoption rate mimics a shelter-in-place order for 40% of the population and results in a greater than 90% decrease in peak number of infections. However, as compared to shelter-in-place, with AACT significantly fewer individuals would be isolated. CONCLUSION: Wide adoption of digital contact tracing can mitigate infection spread similar to universal shelter-in-place, but with considerably fewer individuals isolated.","Nuzzo, Andrea; Tan, Can Ozan; Raskar, Ramesh; DeSimone, Daniel C; Kapa, Suraj; Gupta, Rajiv",Mayo Clin Proc,30,4

Severity of the disease may be associated with several factors. Here, we review clinical features of COVID-19 inpatients with different severities. This cross-sectional study was performed in Imam Reza hospital, Mashhad, Iran, during February-April 2020. COVID-19 patients with typical computed tomography (CT) patterns and/or positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were included. The patients were classified into three groups of moderate, severe, and critical based on disease severity. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings were collected and compared. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Overall, 200 patients with mean age of 69.75 ± 6.39 years, of whom 82 (41%) were female were studied. Disease was severe/critical in the majority of patients (167, 83.5%). Disease severity was significantly associated with age, malignant comorbidities, dyspnea, nausea/vomiting, confusion, respiratory rate, pulse rate, O2 saturation, extent of CT involvement, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), pH, pO2, and aspartate transaminase (P < 0.05). Moreover, complications including shock, coagulopathy, acidosis, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and intubation were significantly higher in patients with higher severities (P < 0.05). O2 saturation, nausea/vomiting, and extent of lung CT involvement were independent predictors of severe/critical COVID-19 (OR 0.342, 45.93, and 25.48, respectively; P < 0.05). Our results indicate O2 saturation, nausea/vomiting, and extent of lung CT involvement as independent predictors of severe COVID-19 conditions.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of postoperative adjuvant transarterial infusion chemotherapy (TAI) with the FOLFOX regimen for HCC patients with MVI. METHODS: In this prospective, phase III, randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial, HCC patients with histologically confirmed MVI were randomly assigned (1:1) after hepatectomy to receive either one to two cycles of adjuvant TAI (AT group) or follow-up without any adjuvant treatment (FU group). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS), while secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and safety. RESULTS: Between June 2016 and April 2019, 127 patients were randomly assigned to the AT group (n = 63) or FU group (n = 64). Clinicopathological characteristics of the two groups were well-balanced. The 6-, 12-, and 18-month OS rates for the AT group were 100.0%, 97.7%, and 97.7%, respectively, and 94.5%, 89.6%, and 78.5% for the FU group, respectively. The 6-, 12-, and 18-month DFS rates for the AT and FU groups were 84.7%, 61.8%, and 58.7%, and 62.9%, 48.1%, and 38.6%, respectively. OS and DFS were significantly better in the AT group than in the FU group (p = 0.037 and 0.023, respectively). No patients in the AT group experienced grade 3 or more severe adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant TAI after hepatectomy may bring survival benefits to HCC patients with MVI.

All patients were classified into primary angle-closure suspect (PACS), primary angle-closure (PAC) and primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). If both eyes were eligible, one eye was randomly selected for study inclusion. ACV, ACD and ACA were evaluated using Scheimpflug imaging technology at three time points: at baseline (T0), 45 min after application of pilocarpine before LPI (T1) and at one-month post-LPI (T2). RESULTS: PACS, PAC and PACG groups included 25 (27.4%), 24 (26.3%) and 42 (46.1%) eyes, respectively. At both time points T1 and T2, mean pupil diameter, ACV and ACA changed significantly (P = 0.00). In all subgroups, ACD decreased significantly at T1 and then increased significantly at T2. ACA was widened by 6 degrees in angles < 26 degrees as compared to 3 degrees in > 26 degrees eyes. In PACG group, mean ACV increased significantly between T0 and T2 (P = 0.0). Other parameters like mean cornea volume (P = 0.27), central corneal thickness (P = 0.29) showed no significant change between time points (T0, T1 and T2).

Methods: The data of cases of COVID-19 epidemic clusters from 19 January, 2020 to 25 February, 2020 were collected from the official platforms of 36 cities in 6 provinces in China. Descriptive statistical methods, &#967;(2) test and curve fitting were used to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of the clustered cases. Results: By 25 February, 2020, the data of 1 052 cases in 366 epidemic clusters were collected. In these clustered cases, 86.9%(914/1 050) occurred in families. Among the 1 046 cases with gender information, 513 were males (49.0%) and 533 were females (51.0%). The cases were mainly young adults between 18 and 59 years old, accounting for 68.5% (711/1 038).

As crowding is an environmental risk factor for contamination, its transmission is high among patients and staff in hospital and also in elderly-care centers. It is more common in the elderly, in men, and subjects with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and malignancy.","Rashedi, Jalil; Mahdavi Poor, Behroz; Asgharzadeh, Vahid; Pourostadi, Mahya; Samadi Kafil, Hossein; Vegari, Ali; Tayebi-Khosroshahi, Hamid; Asgharzadeh, Mohammad",Infez Med,30,20

Thus far, there is no medication or vaccine to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19. As the virus is airborne and transmitted through droplets, there has been significant demand for face masks and other personal protective equipment to prevent the spread of infection. Health care and laboratory workers who come in close contact with infected people or material are at a high risk of infection. Therefore, robust biosafety measures are required at hospitals and laboratories to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Various diagnostic platforms including of serological, molecular and other advanced tools and techniques have been designed and developed for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 and each has its own merits and demerits. Molecular assays such as real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) has been used worldwide for diagnosis of COVID-19. Samples such as nasal swabs or oropharyngeal swabs are used for rRT-PCR. Laboratory acquired infection has been a significant problem worldwide, which has gained importance during the current pandemic as the samples for rRT-PCR may contain intact virus with serious threat. COVID-19 can spread to workers during the sampling, transportation, processing, and disposal of tested samples. Here, we present an overview on advances in diagnosis of COVID-19 and details the issues associated with biosafety procedures and potential safety precautions to be followed during collection, transportation, and processing of COVID-19 samples for laboratory diagnosis so as to avoid virus infection.","Karthik, Kumaragurubaran; Aravindh Babu, Ramasamy Parthiban; Dhama, Kuldeep; Chitra, Murugesan Ananda; Kalaiselvi, Govindan; Alagesan Senthilkumar, Tuticorin Maragatham; Raj, Gopal Dhinakar",Arch Med Res,30,16

Testing took place through the moodle platform, where we used e-test, during the first and second waves of the pandemic. The main aim of the research was to find out what impact the environment in which the testing takes place has on the test results, i.e. in which environment students achieved better results. Printed tests were used for on-site testing. The on-site testing took place in the academic years 2018/2019 (summer term) and 2019/2020 (winter term). The online testing took place in the academic years 2019/2020 (summer term) and 2020/2021 (winter term). We compared the results of the testing, which took place in person at the university, with the results that the students achieved during the online testing. In the research of testing, we used the method of quantitative analysis and descriptive statistics, which allow us to better understand the correlation between the results obtained in onsite and online testing. Based on the data analysis, we confirmed the alternative hypothesis H1: Students who took part in on-site testing achieve better results than students who took part in online testing. Testing results show that students achieve better results in on-site testing than in online testing.","Stradiotova, Eva Nemethova Ildiko Stefancik Radoslav",Advanced Education,30,20

It has a poor prognosis and is clinically challenging to treat. Ferroptosis is a newly defined mode of programmed cell death. The roles and prognostic value of ferroptosis-related long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in gastric cancer remain unknown. Results: In the current study, 20 ferroptosis-related lncRNAs were identified via univariate Cox analysis, least absolute shrinkage, and selection operator Cox regression analysis and used to construct a prognostic signature and classify gastric cancer patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. The signature was validated using TCGA training and testing cohorts. The risk signature was an independent prognostic indicator of survival and accurately predicted the prognoses of patients with gastric cancer. It was also associated with immune cell infiltration. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to investigate underlying mechanisms that the 20 ferroptosis-related lncRNAs were involved in. Chemosensitivity and immune checkpoint inhibitor analyses indicated that high-risk patients were more sensitive to the immune checkpoint inhibitor programmed cell death protein 1. Conclusions: The important role of ferroptosis-related lncRNAs in immune infiltration identified in the current study may assist the determination of personalized prognoses and treatments in patients with gastric cancer. These 20 lncRNAs can be used as the diagnostic and prognostic markers for gastric cancer.","Chen, WenZheng; Feng, ZongFeng; Huang, JianFeng; Fu, PengCheng; Xiong, JianBo; Cao, Yi; Liu, Yi; Tu, Yi; Li, ZhengRong; Jie, ZhiGang; Xiao, Tao",Dis Markers,30,0

In response, federal guidance was issued regarding the use of technology to maintain mandated contacts with children in foster care. States had to make decisions about how to handle other contact types. This study reviewed documentation of state child welfare agency practices regarding face-to-face contact between case managers and child-welfare involved families between March 2020 and May 2020. Using a point-in-time search to obtain publicly accessible documents related to caseworker face-to-face contact and COVID-19, data was located for 49 states and the District of Columbia (n = 50). Documents were analyzed in NVIVO 12 using document analysis. Within the context of face-to-face interactions by child welfare case managers, documents were analyzed in six themes based on the types of services provided to children and families: (1) investigations, (2) family preservation, (3) family team meetings, (4) foster care, (5) adoption, and (6) general child welfare. State decisions about how to manage these contacts varied. In several states case managers were directed to document both virtual and in-person contacts during this time as face-to-face; which may impact future evaluations of child welfare systems during COVID-19. Findings highlight a range of strategies used by state child welfare systems. By reviewing previous practice and hearing what other states are doing, child welfare service agencies have the potential to evaluate appropriately, strengthen their plans and address disparate impacts.","Seay, Kristen D.; McRell, Amanda Stafford",J Child Fam Stud,30,1

In addition, they are the natural reservoirs of a variety of emerging or re-emerging zoonotic pathogens. Rhabdoviridae is one of the most diverse families of RNA viruses, which consists of 20 ecologically diverse genera, infecting plants, mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. To date, three bat-related genera are described, named Lyssavirus, Vesiculovirus, and Ledantevirus. However, the prevalence and the distribution of these bat-related rhabdoviruses remain largely unknown, especially in China. To fill this gap, we performed a large molecular retrospective study based on the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) detection of lyssavirus in bat samples (1044 brain and 3532 saliva samples, from 63 different bat species) originating from 21 provinces of China during 2006–2018. None of them were positive for lyssavirus, but six bat brains (0.6%) of Rhinolophus bat species, originating from Hubei and Hainan provinces, were positive for vesiculoviruses or ledanteviruses. Based on complete genomes, these viruses were phylogenetically classified into three putative new species, tentatively named Yinshui bat virus (YSBV), Taiyi bat virus (TYBV), and Qiongzhong bat virus (QZBV). These results indicate the novel rhabdoviruses circulated in different Chinese bat populations.","Luo, Dong-Sheng; Li, Bei; Shen, Xu-Rui; Jiang, Ren-Di; Zhu, Yan; Wu, Jia; Fan, Yi; Bourhy, Hervé; Hu, Ben; Ge, Xing-Yi; Shi, Zheng-Li; Dacheux, Laurent",Viruses,30,18

Departing from there, and based on Kingdon's multiple streams theory on agenda setting, we identify some barriers that seem to hinder the further establishment and promotion of a solid global health agenda in the EU. The main barriers for creating a strong European global health agenda are the fragmentation of the policy community and the lack of a common definition for global health in Europe. Forwarding the agenda in Europe for global health requires more clarification of the common goals and perspectives of the policy community and the use of arising windows of opportunity.","Aluttis, Christoph; Krafft, Thomas; Brand, Helmut",Glob Health Action,30,16

However, transparent materials used for this type of application are made of materials that do not possess antimicrobial activity. They just avoid direct contact between the person and the biological agent. Therefore, healthy people can become infected through contact of the contaminated material surfaces and this equipment constitute an increasing source of infectious biological waste. Furthermore, infected people can transmit microbial infections easily because the protective equipment do not inactivate the microbial load generated while breathing, sneezing or coughing. In this regard, the goal of this work consisted of fabricating a transparent face shield with intrinsic antimicrobial activity that could provide extra-protection against infectious agents and reduce the generation of infectious waste. Thus, a single-use transparent antimicrobial face shield composed of polyethylene terephthalate and an antimicrobial coating of benzalkonium chloride has been developed for the next generation of facial protective equipment. The antimicrobial coating was analyzed by atomic force microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy with elemental analysis. This is the first facial transparent protective material capable of inactivating enveloped viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in less than one minute of contact, and the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Bacterial infections contribute to severe pneumonia associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their resistance to antibiotics is increasing. Our extra protective broad-spectrum antimicrobial composite material could also be applied for the fabrication of other facial protective tools such as such as goggles, helmets, plastic masks and space separation screens used for counters or vehicles. This low-cost technology would be very useful to combat the current pandemic and protect health care workers from multidrug-resistant infections in developed and underdeveloped countries.","Tuñón-Molina, Alberto; Martí, Miguel; Muramoto, Yukiko; Noda, Takeshi; Takayama, Kazuo; Serrano-Aroca, Ángel",Int J Mol Sci,30,27

In total, 519 serum samples from 213 recovered and 99 polymerase chain reaction re-positive (RP) COVID-19 patients were used in this report. We found that UPT-POCT reporting values correlated highly with NAb titers from 1:4 to 1:1024, with a correlation coefficient r = 0.9654 (P < 0.001), as well as protection rate against RP (r = 0.9886, P < 0.0001). As a significant point for reducing re-positive rate, UPT-POCT values of 4.380, corresponding to NAb titer of 1:64, may be appropriate as an indicator for evaluating high efficiency of protection.

Methods A cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT) of 1441 hospital HCWs randomized to medical masks or N95 respirators, and compared to 481 control HCWs, was performed in Beijing, China, during the winter season of 2008–2009. Participants were followed for development of clinical respiratory illness (CRI). Symptomatic subjects were tested for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenza type B by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results The rate of bacterial colonization was 2.8% in the N95 group (p=0.02), 5.3% among medical mask users (p<0.01) and 7.5% among the controls (p=0.16). N95 respirators were significantly protective (adjusted RR 0.34, 95% CI: 0.21–0.56) against bacterial colonization. Co-infections of two bacteria or a virus and bacteria occurred in up to 3.7% of HCWs, and were significantly lower in the N95 arm. Conclusions N95 respirators were significantly protective against bacterial colonization, co-colonization and viral-bacterial co-infection. We showed that dual respiratory virus or bacterial-viral co-infections can be reduced by the use of N95 respirators.

RESULTS: Thirty-seven % (22/60) of the dogs and 75% (50/67) of the cats were seropositive to L. infantum with a significantly higher seropositivity rate in the cat population (χ(2) = 42.160, P < 0.0001). Twenty-five percent (15/60) of the dogs were positive for Leishmania by blood PCR, 12% by the Leishmania ITS1 HRM PCR and 22% by kDNA PCR. Of the cats, 16% (11/67) were positive by kDNA PCR and none by ITS1 HRM PCR. All the PCR-positive animals were infected by L. infantum verified by DNA sequencing and there was no significant difference between the PCR-positivity in the dog and cat populations. Altogether, 43% (26/60) of the dogs and 79% (53/67) of the cats were positive by serology or PCR for L. infantum. The average Leishmania parasite load in the blood of PCR-positive dogs (42,967 parasites/ml) was significantly higher than in PCR-positive cats (1259 parasites/ml) (t((12)) = 2.33, P = 0.037). Dogs that were positive by the Leishmania ITS1 HRM PCR and kDNA PCR had significantly higher parasite loads than dogs positive only by the kDNA PCR (t((11)) = − 3.186580, P < 0.009). No significant effect was found for FIV seropositivity on Leishmania infection in the cats (χ(2) = 0.506, P = 0.777).

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) was recently identified as a host factor for Zika and dengue viruses; AHR antagonists boost antiviral immunity, decrease viral titers and ameliorate Zika-induced pathology in vivo. Here we report that AHR is activated by infection with different coronaviruses, potentially impacting antiviral immunity and lung epithelial cells. Indeed, the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq from lung tissue detected increased expression of AHR and AHR transcriptional targets, suggesting AHR signaling activation in SARS-CoV-2-infected epithelial cells from COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we detected an association between AHR expression and viral load in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Finally, we found that the pharmacological inhibition of AHR suppressed the replication in vitro of one of the causative agents of the common cold, HCoV-229E, and the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, these findings suggest that AHR activation is a common strategy used by coronaviruses to evade antiviral immunity and promote viral replication, which may also contribute to lung pathology. Future studies should further evaluate the potential of AHR as a target for host-directed antiviral therapy.","Giovannoni, Federico; Li, Zhaorong; Remes-Lenicov, Federico; Dávola, María E.; Elizalde, Mercedes; Paletta, Ana; Ashkar, Ali A.; Mossman, Karen L.; Dugour, Andrea V.; Figueroa, Juan M.; Barquero, Andrea A.; Ceballos, Ana; Garcia, Cybele C.; Quintana, Francisco J.",Nat Commun,30,20

The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 cases among children with hemoglobinopathies and other inherited anemias living in El-Minya Governorate, Egypt, who are at high risk of exposure to infection. This cross-sectional study evaluated data from 258 children with hemoglobinopathies and inherited anemias. A questionnaire was used to collect data about COVID-19 symptoms coupled with appropriate investigations (complete blood count, d-dimer, anti-COVID antibodies, chest computed tomography scans, and polymerase chain reaction). We found 38 of 258 (14.7%) children had mild to moderate COVID-19, while there were no cases with severe form of COVID-19. COVID-19 cases were significantly older (8.63±3.37 vs. 6.71±3.56 y, P=0.01), noncompliant to iron chelators (63.2% vs. 11.8%, P=0.01), had higher serum ferritin (2639.47±835.06 vs. 1038.95±629.87 ng/mL, P<0.0001) and serum iron levels (803.68±261.36 vs. 374.18±156.15 µg/dL, P<0.0001) and more frequently had undergone splenectomy (78.9% vs. 25.5%; P<0.0001) than non-COVID-19 cases.

Information about these incidents and their characteristics are available in myriad forms: as published research or commentary, investigative reports, and within online data collection initiatives. We review the research on attacks on health to understand what data they rely on, what subjects they cover and what gaps exist in order to develop a research agenda going forward. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study utilizes a systematic review of peer-reviewed to identify and understand relevant data about attacks on health in situations of conflict. We identified 1479 papers published before January 1, 2020 using systematic and hand-searching and chose 45 articles for review that matched our inclusion criteria. We extracted data on geographical and conflict foci, methodology, objectives and major themes. Among the included articles, 26 focused on assessment of evidence of attacks, 15 on analyzing their impacts, three on the legal and human rights principles and one on the methods of documentation. We analyzed article data to answer questions about where and when attacks occur and are investigated, what types of attacks occur, who is perpetrating them, and how and why they are studied. We synthesized cross-cutting themes on the impacts of these attacks, mitigation efforts, and gaps in existing data. CONCLUSION: Recognizing limitations in the review, we find there have been comparatively few studies over the past four decades but the literature is growing. To deepen the discussions of the scope of attacks and to enable cross-context comparisons, documentation of attacks on health must be enhanced to make the data more consistent, more thorough, more accessible, include diverse perspectives, and clarify taxonomy. As the research on attacks on health expands, practical questions on how the data is utilized for advocacy, protection and accountability must be prioritized.

Currently, few approaches are mature enough to show operational impact. Based on electronic medical records (EMRs) of 570 COVID-19 inpatients, we proposed an analysis model of diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19 based on the machine learning algorithms and complex networks. Introducing the medical information fusion, we constructed the heterogeneous information network to discover the complex relationships among the syndromes, symptoms, and medicines. We generated the numerical symptom (medicine) embeddings and divided them into seven communities (syndromes) using the combination of Skip-Gram model and Spectral Clustering (SC) algorithm. After analyzing the symptoms and medicine networks, we identified the key factors using six evaluation metrics of node centrality. The experimental results indicate that the proposed analysis model is capable of discovering the critical symptoms and symptom distribution for diagnosis; the key medicines and medicine combinations for treatment. Based on the latest COVID-19 clinical guidelines, this model could result in the higher accuracy results than the other representative clustering algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed model is able to provide tremendously valuable guidance and help the physicians to combat the COVID-19.","Hu, Fang; Huang, Mingfang; Sun, Jing; Zhang, Xiong; Liu, Jifen",Inf Fusion,30,16

The activities associated with the enormously intensified global connectivity have resulted in large amounts of data being generated, which in turn provides opportunities for generating knowledge that will allow more effective management of animal and human health risks. This so-called Big Data has, more recently, been accompanied by the Internet of Things which highlights the increasing presence of a wide range of sensors, interconnected via the Internet. Analysis of this data needs to exploit its complexity, accommodate variation in data quality and should take advantage of its spatial and temporal dimensions, where available. Apart from the development of hardware technologies and networking/communication infrastructure, it is necessary to develop appropriate data management tools that make this data accessible for analysis. This includes relational databases, geographical information systems and most recently, cloud-based data storage such as Hadoop distributed file systems. While the development in analytical methodologies has not quite caught up with the data deluge, important advances have been made in a number of areas, including spatial and temporal data analysis where the spectrum of analytical methods ranges from visualisation and exploratory analysis, to modelling. While there used to be a primary focus on statistical science in terms of methodological development for data analysis, the newly emerged discipline of data science is a reflection of the challenges presented by the need to integrate diverse data sources and exploit them using novel data- and knowledge-driven modelling methods while simultaneously recognising the value of quantitative as well as qualitative analytical approaches. Machine learning regression methods, which are more robust and can handle large datasets faster than classical regression approaches, are now also used to analyse spatial and spatio-temporal data. Multi-criteria decision analysis methods have gained greater acceptance, due in part, to the need to increasingly combine data from diverse sources including published scientific information and expert opinion in an attempt to fill important knowledge gaps. The opportunities for more effective prevention, detection and control of animal health threats arising from these developments are immense, but not without risks given the different types, and much higher frequency, of biases associated with these data.","Pfeiffer, Dirk U.; Stevens, Kim B.",Prev Vet Med,30,30

Starting in February 2021, there was an increase in the frequency of severe watery to hemorrhagic diarrhea cases in neonatal foals in Central Kentucky. Diagnostic investigation of fecal samples failed to detect evidence of diarrhea-causing pathogens including ERVA. Based on Illumina-based metagenomic sequencing, we identified a novel equine rotavirus group B (ERVB) in fecal specimens from the affected foals in the absence of any other known enteric pathogens. Interestingly, the protein sequence of all 11 segments had greater than 96% identity with group B rotaviruses previously found in ruminants. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated clustering of the ERVB with group B rotaviruses of caprine and bovine strains from the USA. Subsequent analysis of 33 foal diarrheic samples by RT-qPCR identified 23 rotavirus B-positive cases (69.69%). These observations suggest that the ERVB originated from ruminants and was associated with outbreaks of neonatal foal diarrhea in the 2021 foaling season in Kentucky. Emergence of the ruminant-like group B rotavirus in foals clearly warrants further investigation due to the significant impact of the disease in neonatal foals and its economic impact on the equine industry.","Uprety, Tirth; Sreenivasan, Chithra C.; Hause, Ben M.; Li, Ganwu; Odemuyiwa, Solomon O.; Locke, Stephan; Morgan, Jocelynn; Zeng, Li; Gilsenan, William F.; Slovis, Nathan; Metcalfe, Laurie; Carter, Craig N.; Timoney, Peter; Horohov, David; Wang, Dan; Erol, Erdal; Adam, Emma; Li, Feng",Viruses,30,20

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to obtain information on symptoms and medical conditions self-reported by non-Twitter social media users during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; to determine how discussion of these symptoms and medical conditions changed over time; and to identify correlations between frequency of the top 5 commonly mentioned symptoms post and daily COVID-19 statistics (new cases, new deaths, new active cases, new recovered cases) in U.S. METHODS We used natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to identify symptom and medical condition topics being discussed on social media between June 14 and December 13, 2020. The sample posts were geotagged by NetBase, a third-party data provider. We calculated the positive predictive value and sensitivity to validate the classification of posts. We also assessed the frequency of health-related discussions on social media over time during the study period, and used Pearson's correlation coefficients to identify statistically significant correlations between the frequency of the 5 most commonly mentioned symptoms and fluctuation of U.S. daily COVID-19 statistics. RESULTS Within a total of 9,807,813 posts (nearly 70% were sourced from the U.S.), we identified discussion of 120 symptom topics and 1,542 medical condition topics. Our classification of the health-related posts had a positive predictive value of over 80% and an average classification rate of 92% sensitivity. The 5 most commonly mentioned symptoms on social media during the study period were: anxiety (in 201,303 posts or 12.2% of the total posts mentioning symptoms), generalized pain (189,673, 11.5%), weight loss (95,793, 5.8%), fatigue (91,252, 5.5%), and coughing (86,235, 5.2%). The 5 most discussed medical conditions were: COVID-19 (in 5,420,276 posts or 66.4% of the total posts mentioning medical conditions), unspecified infectious disease (469,356, 5.8%), influenza (270,166, 3.3%), unspecified disorders of the central nervous system (253,407, 3.1%), and depression (151,752, 1.9%). Changes in posts of frequency of anxiety, generalized pain, and weight loss were statistically significant but negatively correlated with daily new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. (r=-0.49, r=-0.46, r=-0.39, respectively; P<.05). Posts of frequency of anxiety, generalized pain, weight loss, fatigue, and the changes in fatigue positively and statistically significantly correlated with U.S. daily changes of both new deaths and new active cases (r ranged: 0.39 to 0.48, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 and symptoms of anxiety were the two most commonly discussed health-related topics on social media from June 14 to December 13, 2020. Real-time monitoring of social media posts on symptoms and medical conditions may help assess the population's mental health status and enhance public health surveillance for infectious disease.

Furthermore, CT imaging appearances are correlated with patients presenting with different clinical scenarios, such as early versus advanced stages, asymptomatic versus symptomatic patients, and severe versus nonsevere situations. However, its role as a screening and diagnostic tool in COVID-19 remains to be clarified. This article provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of the current literature on chest CT imaging findings with the aim of highlighting the contribution and judicious use of CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19. A search of PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and Scopus was performed to identify studies reporting chest imaging findings in COVID-19. Chest imaging abnormalities associated with COVID-19 were extracted from the eligible studies and diagnostic value of CT in detecting these abnormal changes was compared between studies consisting of both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. A random-effects model was used to perform meta-analysis for calculation of pooled mean values and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of abnormal imaging findings. Fifty-five studies met the selection criteria and were included in the analysis. Pulmonary lesions more often involved bilateral lungs (78%, 95% CI: 45-100%) and were more likely to have a peripheral (65.35%, 95% CI: 25.93-100%) and peripheral plus central distribution (31.12%, 95% CI: 1.96-74.07%), but less likely to have a central distribution (3.57%, 95% CI: 0.99-9.80%). Ground glass opacities (GGO) (58.05%, 95% CI: 16.67-100%), consolidation (44.18%, 95% CI: 1.61-71.46%) and GGO plus consolidation (52.99%, 95% CI: 19.05-76.79%) were the most common findings reported in 94.5% (52/55) of the studies, followed by air bronchogram (42.50%, 95% CI: 7.78-80.39%), linear opacities (41.29%, 95% CI: 7.44-65.06%), crazy-paving pattern (23.57%, 95% CI: 3.13-91.67%) and interlobular septal thickening (22.91%, 95% CI: 0.90-80.49%). CT has low specificity in differentiating pneumonia-related lung changes due to significant overlap between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients with no significant differences in most of the imaging findings between these two groups (P>0.05). Furthermore, normal CT (13.31%, 95% CI: 0.74-38.36%) was reported in 26 (47.3%) studies. Despite widespread use of CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients based on the current literature, CT findings are not pathognomonic as it lacks specificity in differentiating imaging appearances caused by different types of pneumonia. Further, there is a relatively high percentage of normal CT scans. Use of CT as a first-line diagnostic or screening tool in COVID-19 is not recommended.","Sun, Zhonghua; Zhang, Nan; Li, Yu; Xu, Xunhua",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,30,5

Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Setting: All websites (n=27) selling direct to user home self-sampling and testing for COVID-19 (41 tests) in the UK (39 tests) and US (2 tests) identified by a website search on 23rd May 2020. Main outcome measures: Thirteen predefined basic information items to communicate to a user, including who should be tested, when and how testing should be done, test accuracy, and interpretation of results. Results: Many websites did not provide the name or manufacturer of the test (32/41; 78%), when to use the test (10/41; 24%), test accuracy (12/41; 29%), and how to interpret results (21/41; 51%). Sensitivity and specificity were the most commonly reported test accuracy measures (either reported for 27/41 (66%) tests); we could only link these figures to manufacturers documents or publications for four (10%) tests. Predictive values, most relevant to users, were rarely reported (five [12%] tests reported positive predictive values). For molecular virus tests, 9/23 (39%) websites explained that test positives should self-isolate, and 8/23 (35%) explained that test negatives may still have the disease. For antibody tests, 12/18 (67%) websites explained that testing positive does not necessarily infer immunity from future infection. Seven (39%) websites selling antibody tests claimed the test had a CE mark, when they were for a different intended use (venous blood rather than finger-prick samples). Conclusions: At the point of online purchase of home self-sampling COVID-19 tests, users in the UK are provided with incomplete, and in some cases misleading information on test accuracy, intended use and test interpretation.

Infections are highly contagious and often occur as outbreaks. Periodic emergence of new strains are not uncommon and novel variants are named after the place of first reported nucleotide sequence. Here, we identified human norovirus GII.4 Hong Kong variant in stool samples from Thai patients presented with acute gastroenteritis. Comparison of amino acid residues deduced from the viral nucleotide sequence with those of historical and contemporary norovirus GII.4 strains revealed notable differences, which mapped to the defined antigenic sites of the viral major capsid protein. Time-scaled phylogenetic analysis suggests that GII.4 Hong Kong shared common ancestry with GII.4 Osaka first reported in 2007, and more importantly, did not evolve from the now-prevalent GII.4 Sydney lineage. As circulation of norovirus minor variants can lead to eventual widespread transmission in susceptible population, this study underscores the potential emergence of the GII.4 Hong Kong variant, which warrants vigilant molecular epidemiological surveillance.","Chuchaona, Watchaporn; Chansaenroj, Jira; Puenpa, Jiratchaya; Khongwichit, Sarawut; Korkong, Sumeth; Vongpunsawad, Sompong; Poovorawan, Yong",PLoS One,30,1

However, little is known about the infectiousness of RT-PCR positive patients who pass undetected by AGT. In a screening setting for mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with high COVID-19 prevalence (30–40%), 1141 patients were tested using one of five AGTs and RT-PCR. Where the results differed, virus viability in the samples was tested on cell culture (CV-1 cells). The test battery included AGTs by JOYSBIO, Assure Tech, SD Biosensor, VivaChek Biotech and NDFOS. Sensitivities of the ATGs compared to RT-PCR ranged from 42% to 76%. The best test yielded a 76% sensitivity, 97% specificity, 92% positive, and 89% negative predictive values, respectively. However, in the best performing ATG tests, almost 90% of samples with “false negative” AGT results contained no viable virus. Corrected on the virus viability, sensitivities grew to 81–97% and, with one exception, the tests yielded high specificities >96%. Performance characteristics of the best test after adjustment were 96% sensitivity, 97% specificity, 92% positive, and 99% negative predictive values (high prevalence population). We, therefore, believe that virus viability should be considered when assessing the AGT performance. Also, our results indicate that a well-performing antigen test could in a high-prevalence setting serve as an excellent tool for identifying patients shedding viable virus. We also propose that the high proportion of RT-PCR-positive samples containing no viable virus in the group of “false negatives” of the antigen test should be further investigated with the aim of possibly preventing needless isolation of such patients.","Homza, Miroslav; Zelena, Hana; Janosek, Jaroslav; Tomaskova, Hana; Jezo, Eduard; Kloudova, Alena; Mrazek, Jakub; Svagera, Zdenek; Prymula, Roman",Viruses,30,21

Different serotypes of AAV target specific organs and tissues with high efficiency. There exists an increasing demand to manufacture various AAV serotypes in large quantities for pre-clinical and clinical trials. A generic and scalable method has been described in this study to efficiently produce AAV serotypes (AAV1-9) by transfection of a fully characterized cGMP HEK293SF cell line grown in suspension and serum-free medium. First, the production parameters were evaluated using AAV2 as a model serotype. Second, all nine AAV serotypes were produced successfully with yields of 10(13) Vg/L cell culture. Subsequently, AAV2 and AAV6 serotypes were produced in 3-L controlled bioreactors where productions yielded up to 10(13) Vg/L similar to the yields obtained in shake-flasks. For example, for AAV2 10(13) Vg/L cell culture (6.8 × 10(11) IVP/L) were measured between 48 and 64 h post transfection (hpt). During this period, the average cell specific AAV2 yields of 6800 Vg per cell and 460 IVP per cell were obtained with a Vg to IVP ratio of less than 20. Successful operations in bioreactors demonstrated the potential for scale-up and industrialization of this generic process for manufacturing AAV serotypes efficiently.","Chahal, Parminder Singh; Schulze, Erica; Tran, Rosa; Montes, Johnny; Kamen, Amine A.",J Virol Methods,30,25

We recreate a range of urban epidemic trajectories and project the course of the epidemic under two counterfactual scenarios, one in which a strict moratorium on evictions is in place and enforced, and another in which evictions are allowed to resume at baseline or increased rates. We find, across scenarios, that evictions lead to significant increase in infections. Applying our model to Philadelphia using locally-specific parameters shows that the increase is especially profound in models that consider realistically heterogenous cities in which both evictions and contacts occur more frequently in poorer neighborhoods. Our results provide a basis to assess municipal eviction moratoriums and show that policies to stem evictions are a warranted and important component of COVID-19 control.","Sheen, Justin; Nande, Anjalika; Walters, Emma L; Adlam, Ben; Gheorghe, Andrei; Shinnick, Julianna; Tejeda, Maria Florencia; Greenlee, Andrew J; Schneider, Daniel; Hill, Alison L; Levy, Michael Z",medRxiv,30,20

Conclusiones: los cambios organizativos de los hospitales de la CM frente a la pandemia COVID-19 han modificado la dedicación de recursos humanos e infraestructuras de las unidades de neurología y los circuitos de atención del ictus, realización de pruebas diagnósticas, ingreso de los pacientes y seguimiento. Abstract Introduction: The overload of the healthcare system and the organisational changes made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may be having an impact on acute stroke care in the Region of Madrid. Methods: We conducted a survey with sections addressing hospital characteristics, changes in infrastructure and resources, code stroke clinical pathways, diagnostic testing, rehabilitation, and outpatient care. We performed a descriptive analysis of results according to the level of complexity of stroke care (availability of stroke units and mechanical thrombectomy). Results: The survey was completed by 22 of the 26 hospitals in the Madrid Regional Health System that attend adult emergencies, between 16 and 27 April 2020. Ninety-five percent of hospitals had reallocated neurologists to care for patients with COVID-19. The numbers of neurology ward beds were reduced in 89.4% of hospitals; emergency department stroke care pathways were modified in 81%, with specific pathways for suspected COVID-19 infection established in 50% of hospitals; and COVID-19–positive patients with acute stroke were not admitted to neurology wards in 42%. Twenty-four hour on-site availability of mechanical thrombectomy was improved in 10 hospitals, which resulted in a reduction in the number of secondary hospital transfers. The admission of patients with transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke was avoided in 45% of hospitals, and follow-up through telephone consultations was implemented in 100%. Conclusions: The organisational changes made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in hospitals in the Region of Madrid have modified the allocation of neurology department staff and infrastructure, stroke units and stroke care pathways, diagnostic testing, hospital admissions, and outpatient follow-up.","Fuentes, Blanca; Alonso de Leciñana, María; Calleja-Castaño, Patricia; Carneado-Ruiz, Joaquín; Egido-Herrero, José; Gil-Núñez, Antonio; Masjuán-Vallejo, Jaime; Vivancos-Mora, José; Rodríguez-Pardo, Jorge; Riera-López, Nicolás; Ximénez-Carrillo, Álvaro; Cruz-Culebras, Antonio; Gómez-Escalonilla, Carlos; Díez-Tejedor, Exuperio",Neurologia,30,26

It is caused by a new positive-sense RNA virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). G-quadruplexes (G4s) are nucleic acid secondary structures involved in the control of a variety of biological processes including viral replication. Using several G4 prediction tools, we identified highly putative G4 sequences (PQSs) within the positive-sense (+gRNA) and negative-sense (−gRNA) RNA strands of SARS-CoV-2 conserved in related betacoronaviruses. By using multiple biophysical techniques, we confirmed the formation of two G4s in the +gRNA and provide the first evidence of G4 formation by two PQSs in the −gRNA of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, biophysical and molecular approaches were used to demonstrate for the first time that CNBP, the main human cellular protein bound to SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, binds and promotes the unfolding of G4s formed by both strands of SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. Our results suggest that G4s found in SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and its negative-sense replicative intermediates, as well as the cellular proteins that interact with them, are relevant factors for viral genes expression and replication cycle, and may constitute interesting targets for antiviral drugs development.","Bezzi, Georgina; Piga, Ernesto J.; Binolfi, Andrés; Armas, Pablo",Int J Mol Sci,30,18

The mechanism(s) by which this occurs remains unclear. Methods We investigated the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 at maternal-fetal interface in pregnant women who tested positive for the virus using RNA in situ hybridization (viral RNA), immunohistochemistry, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. To investigate whether viral infection alters the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in placenta which controls blood pressure, we treated human trophoblasts with recombinant Spike protein or a live modified virus with a vesicular stomatitis viral backbone expressing Spike protein (VSV-S). Findings Viral colonization was highest in maternal decidua, fetal trophoblasts, Hofbauer cells, and in placentas delivered prematurely. We localized SARS-CoV-2 to cells expressing Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and demonstrate that infected placentas had significantly reduced ACE2. In response to both Spike protein and VSV-S, cellular ACE2 decreased while Angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) increased with concomitant increase in soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1(sFlt1). Viral infection decreased pro-angiogenic factors, AT2R and Placental growth factor, which competitively binds to sFlt1. Sera from infected pregnant women had elevated levels of sFlt1 and Angiotensin II type 1-Receptor Autoantibodies prior to delivery, both signatory markers of preeclampsia. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 colonizes ACE2-expressing maternal and fetal cells in the placenta. Infection in pregnant women correlates with alteration of placental RAS. As RAS regulates blood pressure, SARS-CoV-2 infection may thus increase adverse hemodynamic outcomes such as preeclampsia in pregnant women.

Various digital health technologies are currently being used as weapons in the fight against the pandemic in different ways by countries. The main objective of this review is to explore the role of digital health technologies in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and address the gaps in the use of these technologies for tackling the pandemic. Methods: We conducted a scoping review guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines. The articles were searched using electronic databases including MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Library, and Hinari. In addition, Google and Google scholar were searched. Studies that focused on the application of digital health technologies on COVID-19 prevention and control were included in the review. We characterized the distribution of technological applications based on geographical locations, approaches to apply digital health technologies and main findings. The study findings from the existing literature were presented using thematic content analysis. Results: A total of 2,601 potentially relevant studies were generated from the initial search and 22 studies were included in the final review. The review found that telemedicine was used most frequently, followed by electronic health records and other digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, and the internet of things (IoT). Digital health technologies were used in multiple ways in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including screening and management of patients, methods to minimize exposure, modelling of disease spread, and supporting overworked providers. Conclusion: Digital health technologies like telehealth, mHealth, electronic medical records, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and big data/internet were used in different ways for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic in different settings using multiple approaches. For more effective deployment of digital health tools in times of pandemics, development of a guiding policy and standard on the development, deployment, and use of digital health tools in response to a pandemic is recommended.","Tilahun, Binyam; Gashu, Kassahun Dessie; Mekonnen, Zeleke Abebaw; Endehabtu, Berhanu Fikadie; Angaw, Dessie Abebaw",Yearb Med Inform,30,20

PROCEDURE: Normal Harderian glands were evaluated ultrasonographically in 20 rabbits, 10 guinea pigs, and eight chinchillas. The Harderian gland was measured ultrasonographically in horizontal and vertical planes. Normal Harderian gland sizes were then compared with sizes in 27 rabbits, 13 guinea pigs, and three chinchillas that had exophthalmos. RESULTS: Harderian glands in normal rabbits were 0.69 ± 0.07 cm (mean value ± SD) horizontally and 1.33 ± 0.14 cm vertically. Harderian glands in normal guinea pigs were 0.58 ± 0.05 cm horizontally and 0.61 ± 0.10 vertically. In normal chinchillas, the Harderian glands were 0.53 ± 0.04 cm horizontally and 0.53 ± 0.03 cm vertically. Harderian glands were significantly larger in the vertical plane in rabbits with exophthalmos (P = 0.001) and in the horizontal plane in guinea pigs with exophthalmos (P = 0.018). Harderian glands of rabbits with exophthalmos were significantly larger in both diseased and healthy glands in both planes compared with those of normal rabbits. Guinea pigs and chinchillas with exophthalmos had larger Harderian glands bilaterally in only the vertical plane. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonography is a valuable diagnostic imaging technique to evaluate the Harderian gland in the rabbit, guinea pig, and chinchilla. Retrobulbar pathologic processes cause enlargement of the Harderian gland, which may be attributable to inflammation or possible obstruction of the excretory ducts.","Hittmair, Katharina M.; Tichy, Alexander; Nell, Barbara",Vet Ophthalmol,30,21

Test were performed at time 0 and after 14 days; Rt-PCR and CLIA assays were also perfoRmed in positive Viva-DiagTM cases. 606 and 393 HCW had blood sample taken at time 0 and 14, respectively. Results Overall, 9 HCW (1.5%) resulted not-negative at Viva-DiagTM and one of them was confirmed positive for SARS-COV2 infection at RT-PCR oropharingeal swab. At time 0, all 9 cases showed some IgM expression and only one IgG; after 14 days IgM persisted in all cases while IgG became evident in 4 ones. A parallel CLIA test was performed in 23 quaratined subjetcs and in all Viva-Diag not negative cases. CLIA confirmed a positive level of IgM in 5/13 positive Viva-Diag cases; conversely, IgG was confirmed positive at CLIA in 4/5 cases positive at Viva-Diag.

A county health ranking and roadmaps program has been established to identify factors associated with disparity in mobility and mortality of COVID-19 in all counties in the United States. The risk factors associated with county-level mortality of COVID-19 with various levels of prevalence are not well understood. METHODS: Using the data obtained from the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps program, this study applied a negative binomial design to the county-level mortality counts of COVID-19 as of August 27, 2020 in the United States. In this design, the infected counties were categorized into three levels of infections using clustering analysis based on time-varying cumulative confirmed cases from March 1 to August 27, 2020. COVID-19 patients were not analyzed individually but were aggregated at the county-level, where the county-level deaths of COVID-19 confirmed by the local health agencies. Clustering analysis and Kruskal–Wallis tests were used in our statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 3125 infected counties were assigned into three classes corresponding to low, median, and high prevalence levels of infection. Several risk factors were significantly associated with the mortality counts of COVID-19, where higher level of air pollution (0.153, P < 0.001) increased the mortality in the low prevalence counties and elder individuals were more vulnerable in both the median (0.049, P < 0.001) and high (0.114, P < 0.001) prevalence counties. The segregation between non-Whites and Whites (low: 0.015, P < 0.001; median:0.025, P < 0.001; high: 0.019, P = 0.005) and higher Hispanic population (low and median: 0.020, P < 0.001; high: 0.014, P = 0.009) had higher likelihood of risk of the deaths in all infected counties. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality of COVID-19 depended on sex, race/ethnicity, and outdoor environment. The increasing awareness of the impact of these significant factors may help decision makers, the public health officials, and the general public better control the risk of pandemic, particularly in the reduction in the mortality of COVID-19.

In the pathogenesis of AD, the apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism is essential for the clearance of Aβ. In this study, recombinant Aβ42 was expressed and purified via the pET-30a expression vector and E.coli production system to elucidate the physiological effects of Aβ on HDL metabolism. The recombinant human Aβ protein (51 aa) was purified to at least 95% purity and characterized in either the lipid-free and lipid-bound states with apoA-I. Aβ was incorporated into the reconstituted HDL (rHDL) (molar ratio 95:5:1, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC):cholesterol:apoA-I) with various apoA-I:Aβ ratios from 1:0 to 1:0.5, 1:1 and 1:2. With an increasing molar ratio of Aβ, the α-helicity of apoA-I was decreased from 62% to 36% with a red shift of the Trp wavelength maximum fluorescence from 337 to 340 nm in apoA-I. The glycation reaction of apoA-I was accelerated further by the addition of Aβ. The treatment of fructose and Aβ caused more multimerization of apoA-I in the lipid-free state and in HDL. The phospholipid-binding ability of apoA-I was impaired severely by the addition of Aβ in a dose-dependent manner. The phagocytosis of LDL into macrophages was accelerated more by the presence of Aβ with the production of more oxidized species. Aβ severely impaired tissue regeneration, and a microinjection of Aβ enhanced embryotoxicity. In conclusion, the beneficial functions of apoA-I and HDL were severely impaired by the addition of Aβ via its detrimental effect on secondary structure. The impairment of HDL functionality occurred more synergistically by means of the co-addition of fructose and Aβ.","Cho, Kyung-Hyun",Molecules,30,19

However, the potential impact of different treatments, and consequently research and procurement priorities, have not been clear. Methods and Findings We develop a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, COVID-19 disease and clinical care to explore the potential public-health impact of a range of different potential therapeutics, under a range of different scenarios varying: i) healthcare capacity, ii) epidemic trajectories; and iii) drug efficacy in the absence of supportive care. In each case, the outcome of interest was the number of COVID-19 deaths averted in scenarios with the therapeutic compared to scenarios without. We find the impact of drugs like dexamethasone (which are delivered to the most critically-ill in hospital and whose therapeutic benefit is expected to depend on the availability of supportive care such as oxygen and mechanical ventilation) is likely to be limited in settings where healthcare capacity is lowest or where uncontrolled epidemics result in hospitals being overwhelmed. As such, it may avert 22% of deaths in high-income countries but only 8% in low-income countries (assuming R=1.35). Therapeutics for different patient populations (those not in hospital, early in the course of infection) and types of benefit (reducing disease severity or infectiousness, preventing hospitalisation) could have much greater benefits, particularly in resource-poor settings facing large epidemics. Conclusions There is a global asymmetry in who is likely to benefit from advances in the treatment of COVID-19 to date, which have been focussed on hospitalised-patients and predicated on an assumption of adequate access to supportive care. Therapeutics that can feasibly be delivered to those earlier in the course of infection that reduce the need for healthcare or reduce infectiousness could have significant impact, and research into their efficacy and means of delivery should be a priority.","Whittaker, C.; Watson, O.; Alvarez-Moreno, C.; Angkasekwinai, N.; Boonyasiri, A.; Carlos-Triana, L.; Chanda, D.; Charoenpong, L.; Chayakulkeeree, M.; Cooke, G.; Croda, J.; Cucunuba, Z.; Djafaara, B.; Estofolete, C.; Eugenia-Grillet, M.; Faria, N.; Figueiredo-Costa, S.; Forero-Pena, D.; Gibb, D.; Gordon, A.; Hamers, R.; Hamlet, A.; Irawany, V.; Jitmuang, A.; Keurueangkul, N.; Kimani, T.

This study analyses hospitalisation rates for 37 emergency-sensitive conditions in the largest German-wide hospital network during different pandemic phases. METHODS: Using claims data of 80 hospitals, consecutive cases between 1 January and 17 November 2020 were analysed and compared with a corresponding period in 2019. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) comparing the two periods were calculated using Poisson regression to model the number of hospitalisations per day. RESULTS: There was a reduction in hospitalisations between 12 March and 13 June 2020 (coinciding with the first pandemic wave) with 32 807 hospitalisations (349.0/day) as opposed to 39 379 (419.0/day) in 2019 (IRR 0.83, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.85, p<0.01). During the following period (14 June-17 November 2020, including the start of second wave), hospitalisations were reduced from 63 799 (406.4/day) in 2019 to 59 910 (381.6/day) in 2020, but this reduction was not as pronounced (IRR 0.94, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.95, p<0.01). During the first wave hospitalisations for acute myocardial infarction, aortic aneurysm/dissection, pneumonitis, paralytic ileus/intestinal obstruction and pulmonary embolism declined but subsequently increased compared with the corresponding periods in 2019. In contrast, hospitalisations for sepsis, pneumonia, obstructive pulmonary disease and intracranial injuries were reduced during the entire observation period. CONCLUSIONS: There was an overall reduction of absolute hospitalisations for emergency-sensitive conditions in Germany during the first 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic with heterogeneous effects on different disease categories.

In Italy, these effects have been particularly pronounced. While research on the COVID-19 outbreak has mainly focused on the clinical features of infected patients and the psychological impact on the general population and health professionals, no investigation has yet assessed the psychological impact of the pandemic on parents. In the present research, we conducted a web-based survey of Italian parents to examine the prevalence of parenting-related exhaustion—and to identify its associated risk and protective factors—4 weeks into the lockdown. METHODS: A total of 1,226 parents provided their consent to participate in the study and completed a demographic questionnaire, information relating to particular COVID-19 experiences, and measures of emotional exhaustion, parental resilience, social connections, and psychological distress during the lockdown. RESULTS: Seventeen percent of our sample experienced significant parenting-related exhaustion, with mothers more severely affected. Multiple regression analyses showed that greater parenting-related exhaustion was predicted by psychological distress, lower parental resilience, motherhood, fewer perceived social connections, and being single, as well as having a child with special needs, having a large number of children, and having younger children. CONCLUSION: The findings add further support to the call for preventive programs to support parents throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health professionals and social workers should be warned of the effects of lockdown and social distancing on parenting and, consequently, the well-being of children.","Marchetti, Daniela; Fontanesi, Lilybeth; Mazza, Cristina; Di Giandomenico, Serena; Roma, Paolo; Verrocchio, Maria Cristina",J Pediatr Psychol,30,30

A range of personal protective equipment that provides different degrees of facial and respiratory protection is available. It is apparent from the recent experiences with severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza that healthcare workers may have difficulty in choosing the correct type of facial and respiratory protection in any given clinical situation.

However, a complete autopsy is frequently not feasible in highly transmissible diseases due to biohazard challenges. Minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) is a needle-based approach aimed at collecting samples of key organs without opening the body, which may be a valid alternative in these cases. We aimed to: (a) provide biosafety guidelines for conducting MIAs in COVID-19 cases, (b) compare the performance of MIA versus complete autopsy, and (c) evaluate the safety of the procedure. Between October and December 2020, MIAs were conducted in six deceased patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, in a basic autopsy room, with reinforced personal protective equipment. Samples from the lungs and key organs were successfully obtained in all cases. A complete autopsy was performed on the same body immediately after the MIA. The diagnoses of the MIA matched those of the complete autopsy. In four patients, COVID-19 was the main cause of death, being responsible for the different stages of diffuse alveolar damage. No COVID-19 infection was detected in the personnel performing the MIAs or complete autopsies. In conclusion, MIA might be a feasible, adequate and safe alternative for cause of death investigation in COVID-19 cases.","Rakislova, Natalia; Marimon, Lorena; Ismail, Mamudo R.; Carrilho, Carla; Fernandes, Fabiola; Ferrando, Melania; Castillo, Paola; Rodrigo-Calvo, Maria Teresa; Guerrero, José; Ortiz, Estrella; Muñoz-Beatove, Abel; Martinez, Miguel J.; Hurtado, Juan Carlos; Navarro, Mireia; Bassat, Quique; Maixenchs, Maria; Delgado, Vima; Wallong, Edwin; Aceituno, Anna; Kim, Jean; Paganelli, Christina; Goco, Norman J.; Aldecoa, Iban; Martinez-Pozo, Antonio; Martinez, Daniel; Ramírez-Ruz, José; Cathomas, Gieri; Haab, Myriam; Menéndez, Clara; Ordi, Jaume",Pathogens,30,1

Specifically, it is recognized that ocrelizumab reduces or abrogates anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody production after natural infection or vaccination, while very little is known about T-cell responses. METHODS: We developed an interferon (IFN)-γ release assay (IGRA) to detect T-cell responses specific to SARS-CoV-2 after overnight stimulation of whole blood with peptide libraries covering the immunodominant sequence domains of the Spike glycoprotein (S) and the Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N). RESULTS: Five patients with MS receiving ocrelizumab treatment for at least 1 year and recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled in the study. Despite the absence or the very low concentration of anti-S antibodies, a T-cell response was detectable in all the five MS patients. These results are in accordance with the marked reduction of peripheral B-lymphocyte absolute counts induced by ocrelizumab, that, conversely, did not affect peripheral blood T-lymphocyte subset absolute and relative counts and CD4/CD8 ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of specific T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients receiving B-cell depleting therapies represents a useful tool to improve the diagnostic approach in SARS-CoV-2 infection and to accurately assess the immunological response after natural infection or vaccination.","Iannetta, Marco; Landi, Doriana; Cola, Gaia; Malagnino, Vincenzo; Teti, Elisabetta; Fraboni, Daniela; Buccisano, Francesco; Grelli, Sandro; Coppola, Luigi; Campogiani, Laura; Massimo, Andreoni; Marfia, Girolama Alessandra; Sarmati, Loredana",Mult Scler Relat Disord,30,23

Since it is a zoonotic virus, the exact source is still unknown, but it is believed bats may be the primary reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 through which it has been transferred to humans. In this review, we have tried to summarize some of the approaches that could be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Firstly, plants or plant-based products have been effective against different viral diseases, and secondly, plants or plant-based natural products have the minimum adverse effect.

There are limited data exploring the relative impact of geographical and socioeconomic factors on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs. Aim: To estimate and explore SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody seroprevalence in HCWs and support staff at a hospital in South West England. Methods: We conducted a nested cross-sectional study from May-July 2020. Inverse probability weighted regression was used to estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and associations with demographic and socioeconomic risk factors that were robust to selection into testing. Findings: Attendance for testing varied by demographic and socioeconomic factors. The overall rate of SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence among tested staff was 9.3% (638/6858). The highest seroprevalence was found in wards associated with SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and among junior staff with patient-facing roles. Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) staff had increased odds of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (adjusted OR: 1.99, 95%CI: 1.69, 2.34; p<0.001) relative to White staff, except for those categorised as Medical/Dental. We found a significant association between neighbourhood deprivation and seroprevalence (p<0.01). Seroprevalence ranged from 12% in staff residing in areas with the greatest relative deprivation to 8.4% in the least deprived. Conclusion: Transmission between staff groups is evident within the healthcare setting. BAME individuals were at increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Work role, area of residence, and neighbourhood deprivation all contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. As hospitals introduce routine staff SARS-CoV-2 testing they should consider differential uptake of testing among staff groups.","Jones, C. R.; Hamilton, F. W.; Thompson, A.; Morris, T.

Early childhood infections with well-known or emerging viruses can lay the pathophysiologic framework for asthma development and exacerbation later in life, which may be due partly to alteration of the airway microbiome. Once asthma is established, acute exacerbations are usually associated with infections with respiratory viruses, such as rhinoviruses (RVs). Once again, there are bidirectional interactions between viruses and airway bacteria that appear to influence the severity of illness and the likelihood of exacerbation. Studies employing recent advances in viral and bacterial identification analytic techniques will clarify these new concepts and may provide the basis for new treatments or prevention or respiratory infection-associated exacerbation.

However, cell culture may still have added value in identifying viruses not detected by PCR. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate the yield and clinical impact of routine respiratory virus culture among children with a negative PCR result. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was performed from Jan. 2013 to Sept. 2015. Respiratory samples from hospitalized or immunocompromised patients <18 years old were routinely inoculated on traditional tube cell culture monolayers if they tested negative by a PCR assay for 12 respiratory viruses. We studied patients with a respiratory specimen negative by PCR and positive by culture. Duplicates and samples of sold services were excluded. Data on demographics, clinical history, laboratory findings, and patient management were collected from patients’ charts. Descriptive and multivariate statistics were performed. RESULTS: Overall, 4638 PCR-negative samples were inoculated in cell culture. Of those, 196 (4.2%) were cell culture positive, and 144 met study inclusion criteria. Most subjects (81.9%) were hospitalized. Mean age was 2.4 ± 3.4 years. The viruses most frequently isolated were cytomegalovirus (33.3%) and enteroviruses (19.4%). Cell culture results prompted a change in management in 5 patients (3.5%), all of whom had acyclovir initiated for localized HSV-1 infection. Four of these had skin or mucosal lesions that could be sampled to establish a diagnosis.

In addition to the classic modification of the host endocrine system by either direct or indirect destruction of the endocrine organs and/or effects exerted by systemic production of inflammatory and/or stress mediators, recent progress in molecular virology and endocrinology has revealed that virus-encoded molecules might alter the host endocrine-signaling systems by affecting extracellular and/or intracellular signal transduction and hormone sensitivity of host target tissues. Here, we provide a brief overview of such viral-mediated modulation of host endocrine signaling systems.

As anti-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) restrictive measures have prevented crowds from entering stadiums, analysis of the past two football seasons can reveal important details. Objective: This paper aims to compare the last two football seasons in Italy with the previous six, highlighting changes due to the absence of cheering. Methods: We compared the average percentages of points obtained in home matches from 2013 to 2019 with those in the timelapse 2019-2021. The same operation was performed with referee statistics, such as fouls, penalties, and cards awarded against home teams. To do this, we used Welch's t-test and percentage increases. Pearson and Spearman's correlations were searched between the percentages of points collected in home matches and total points earned from 2013 to 2021. Results: The average percentage of points collected by teams in home matches dropped by 8% (Welch’s t = −4.3). The negative correlations between home collected points and total points in 2013-2019 timelapse have significantly diminished during the last two seasons (Welch’s t = 6.2), approaching zero. Penalties against home teams have increased by 30% (Welch’s t = 2.6), reaching 51.4%. Conclusions: This research provides statistical evidence supporting the crowd’s impact on sports and refereeing performance in Serie A. However, our results also suggest that part of the home advantage is linked to factors independent of the audience.

Disparities in social and structural determinants of health disproportionately affect those experiencing incarceration, making them more vulnerable to COVID-19. Additionally, prisons are sites of congregate living, making it impossible to practice social distancing, and most prisons have relied only on incremental measures to reduce risk and spread of COVID-19. To more fully understand the impact that COVID-19 is having on incarcerated populations, it is critical to have systematic data on testing, test positivity, cases, and case fatality. Using data from the COVID Prison Project, we present data on 53 prison systems COVID-19 testing, test positivity, case, and case fatality by state and compare these data with each state's general population. Results: Many states are not reporting full information on COVID testing with some also not reporting on case fatality. Among those reporting data, there is a wide variation between testing, test positivity, and case rates within prison systems and as compared to the general population. However, when more tests are deployed more cases are identified with the majority of state prisons having higher case rates than their general population. Conclusions: These findings underscore the need for the implementation and study of COVID-19 mitigation and surveillance strategies to flatten the COVID-19 curve in prisons across the country.

The measures, usually consisting of a combination of border entry/exit screening, quarantine, isolation, and communications, were resource intensive, and modeling and observational studies indicate that border screening is not effective at detecting infectious persons. Moreover, border screening has high opportunity costs, financially and in terms of the use of scarce public health staff resources during a time of high need. We discuss the border-screening experiences with SARS and influenza and propose an approach to decision-making for future pandemics.

These restrictions hinder the reproducibility of existing results based on private healthcare data and also limit new research. Synthetically-generated healthcare data solve this problem by preserving privacy and enabling researchers and policymakers to drive decisions and methods based on realistic data. Healthcare data can include information about multiple in- and out- patient visits of patients, making it a time-series dataset which is often influenced by protected attributes like age, gender, race etc. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated health inequities, with certain subgroups experiencing poorer outcomes and less access to healthcare. To combat these inequities, synthetic data must “fairly” represent diverse minority subgroups such that the conclusions drawn on synthetic data are correct and the results can be generalized to real data. In this article, we develop two fairness metrics for synthetic data, and analyze all subgroups defined by protected attributes to analyze the bias in three published synthetic research datasets. These covariate-level disparity metrics revealed that synthetic data may not be representative at the univariate and multivariate subgroup-levels and thus, fairness should be addressed when developing data generation methods. We discuss the need for measuring fairness in synthetic healthcare data to enable the development of robust machine learning models to create more equitable synthetic healthcare datasets.","Bhanot, Karan; Qi, Miao; Erickson, John S.; Guyon, Isabelle; Bennett, Kristin P.",Entropy (Basel),30,26

METHODS: : Our dataset from local hospitals consisted of 284 COVID-19 images, 281 community-acquired pneumonia images, 293 secondary pulmonary tuberculosis images; and 306 healthy control images. We first used pretrained models (PTMs) to learn features, and proposed a novel (L, 2) transfer feature learning algorithm to extract features, with a hyperparameter of number of layers to be removed (NLR, symbolized as L). Second, we proposed a selection algorithm of pretrained network for fusion to determine the best two models characterized by PTM and NLR. Third, deep CCT fusion by discriminant correlation analysis was proposed to help fuse the two features from the two models. Micro-averaged (MA) F1 score was used as the measuring indicator. The final determined model was named CCSHNet. RESULTS: : On the test set, CCSHNet achieved sensitivities of four classes of 95.61%, 96.25%, 98.30%, and 97.86%, respectively. The precision values of four classes were 97.32%, 96.42%, 96.99%, and 97.38%, respectively. The F1 scores of four classes were 96.46%, 96.33%, 97.64%, and 97.62%, respectively. The MA F1 score was 97.04%. In addition, CCSHNet outperformed 12 state-of-the-art COVID-19 detection methods. CONCLUSIONS: : CCSHNet is effective in detecting COVID-19 and other lung infectious diseases using first-line clinical imaging and can therefore assist radiologists in making accurate diagnoses based on CCTs.","Wang, Shui-Hua; Nayak, Deepak Ranjan; Guttery, David S.; Zhang, Xin; Zhang, Yu-Dong",Inf Fusion,30,20

While most patients present mild symptoms, descending pneumonia can lead to severe respiratory insufficiency. Up to 50% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea or nausea, intriguingly associating with prolonged symptoms and increased severity. Thus, models to understand and validate drug efficiency in COVID-19 patients are of urgent need. Methods Human intestinal organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSC-HIOs) have led, due to their complexity in mimicking human intestinal architecture, to an unprecedented number of successful disease models including gastrointestinal infections. Here, we employed PSC-HIOs to dissect SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and its inhibition by remdesivir, one of the leading drugs investigated for treatment of COVID-19. Results Immunostaining for viral entry receptor ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein priming protease TMPRSS2 showed broad expression in the gastrointestinal tract with highest levels in the intestine, the latter faithfully recapitulated by PSC-HIOs. Organoids could be readily infected with SARS-CoV-2 followed by viral spread across entire PSC-HIOs, subsequently leading to organoid deterioration. However, SARS-CoV-2 spared goblet cells lacking ACE2 expression. Importantly, we challenged PSC-HIOs for drug testing capacity. Specifically, remdesivir effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection dose-dependently at low micromolar concentration and rescued PSC-HIO morphology. Conclusions Thus, PSC-HIOs are a valuable tool to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify and validate drugs especially with potential action in the gut.","Krüger, Jana; Groß, Rüdiger; Conzelmann, Carina; Müller, Janis A.; Koepke, Lennart; Sparrer, Konstantin M.J.; Weil, Tatjana; Schütz, Desirée; Seufferlein, Thomas; Barth, Thomas F.E.; Stenger, Steffen; Heller, Sandra; Münch, Jan; Kleger, Alexander",Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol,30,20

Although it is most closely related to nodaviruses, Orsay virus differs from nodaviruses in its genome organization. In particular, the Orsay virus RNA2 segment encodes a putative novel protein of unknown function, termed delta, which is absent from all known nodaviruses. Here we present evidence that Orsay virus utilizes a ribosomal frameshifting strategy to express a novel fusion protein from the viral capsid (alpha) and delta ORFs. Moreover, the fusion protein was detected in purified virus fractions, demonstrating that it is most likely incorporated into Orsay virions. Furthermore, N-terminal sequencing of both the fusion protein and the capsid protein demonstrated that these proteins must be translated from a non-canonical initiation site. While the function of the alpha–delta fusion remains cryptic, these studies provide novel insights into the fundamental properties of this new clade of viruses.","Jiang, Hongbing; Franz, Carl J.; Wu, Guang; Renshaw, Hilary; Zhao, Guoyan; Firth, Andrew E.; Wang, David",Virology,30,16

Here we complement these data by describing the profile of sleep across four time-points: the first and second lockdown (TL, PL) and the months preceding them (pre-TL, pre-PL). An online survey was completed by 214 participants (M(age) = 36.78 ± 14.2 y; 159 F) during TL and again during PL. All sleep-related questions (including items of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) required a double answer, one referred to the current lockdown and one to the month preceding the lockdown. Bedtime and rise time were delayed in TL and then advanced in pre-PL and PL. Similarly, time in bed increased in TL and then decreased in pre-PL and PL. Sleep quality worsened in the two lockdowns compared to the preceding periods and the proportion of poor sleepers correspondingly increased in both lockdowns. Sleep habits and quality displayed different profiles across phases of the pandemic. Sleep timing was altered during the first lockdown and then returned towards baseline (likely due to normalized working schedules). Instead, sleep quality, which markedly worsened during both lockdowns, appears particularly sensitive to changes in life habits and psychological factors, independently of sleep habits. Our findings also point to a possible role of acute and chronic stress (experienced during the first and second wave, respectively) in modulating sleep changes across the pandemic waves.","Conte, Francesca; Cellini, Nicola; De Rosa, Oreste; Rescott, Marissa Lynn; Malloggi, Serena; Giganti, Fiorenza; Ficca, Gianluca",J Psychiatr Res,30,20

During the COVID-19 pandemic, several Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures have been adopted to reduce nosocomial microorganism transmission. We performed a case–control study to identify if the incidence of MDR bacterial infections while using pandemic-related preventive measures is lower than in previous years. From 2017 to 2020, we monitored hospital discharges over a four-month period (P #) (1 March to 30 June) in St. Andrea Hospital, Rome. In total, we reported 1617 discharges. Pearson’s chi-squared test was used to identify significant differences. A value of p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A significant reduction in the incidence of total MDR bacterial infections was observed during the pandemic compared to in prepandemic years (p < 0.05). We also found a significantly higher incidence of MDR bacterial infections in COVID-19 departments compared with other medical departments (29% and 19%, respectively), with extended-spectrum β-lactamase Klebsiella pneumoniae as the pathogens presenting the highest increase. This study demonstrates that maintaining a high level of preventive measures could help tackle an important health problem such as that of the spread of MDR bacteria.","Bentivegna, Enrico; Luciani, Michelangelo; Arcari, Luca; Santino, Iolanda; Simmaco, Maurizio; Martelletti, Paolo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,30,20

These behavioral patterns affect and are affected by the quality of mother-infant interaction. In most studies with full-term infants, the Social-Positive Oriented pattern (i.e., the infant's ability to soothe his/her emotions in the context of reciprocal and positive interactions) is the most prevalent pattern, followed by the Distressed-Inconsolable and by the Self-Comfort Oriented patterns. However, these patterns are understudied in other populations beyond the US and European countries. The current research addresses this gap by studying the regulatory behavior patterns and their association with mother-infant interactions in Brazilian dyads and evaluating the association of these regulatory patterns with demographics. Analyses were based on data collected for 40 infants (20 boys, 20 girls) and their mothers. Infants' regulatory behavior patterns were evaluated in the Face-to-Face Still-Face paradigm and mother-infant interaction was evaluated during free play at 3 months age. Notably, our findings indicate that Distressed-Inconsolable was the most prevalent pattern in this sample; followed by the Social-Positive Oriented and the Self-Comfort Oriented patterns. Furthermore, we found that maternal sensitivity and family SES (social-economic status) predicted infant patterns of regulatory behavior.","da Costa Ribeiro, Camila; Teodoro, Ana Teresa Hernandes; dos Santos, Pedro Lopes; Lamônica, Dionísia Aparecida Cusin; Fuertes, Marina",Early Hum Dev,30,3

Early observations that global dysregulation of −1 PRF had deleterious effects on yeast cell growth suggested that −1 PRF may be used to control cellular gene expression, and the cell cycle in particular. Collection of sufficient numbers of viral −1 PRF signals coupled with advances in computer sciences enabled 2 complementary computational approaches to identify −1 PRF signals in free living organisms. The unexpected observation that almost all −1 PRF events on eukaryotic mRNAs direct ribosomes to premature termination codons engendered the hypothesis that −1 PRF signals post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by functioning as mRNA destabilizing elements. Emerging research suggests that some human diseases are associated with global defects in −1 PRF.

In respiratory infections it is often difficult to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections, and empirical treatment is common. Enhanced viral testing is expected to clarify clinical decision-making and reduce the prescription of antibacterial agents, but the impact of such information on patient care is unclear. METHODS: We conducted a (1:1) randomized controlled clinical trial involving 998 adults with respiratory symptoms, fever, chest pain or poor general condition in the emergency unit of a tertiary hospital. Multiplex PCR results for 496 patients were available in 24 hours (intervention group) and those for the remaining 502 patients were available in 7 days (control group). Our primary outcome measures were the duration of hospitalization and the consumption of antibiotics within 30 days of enrolment. RESULTS: In all, 841 of 998 (84%) patients had respiratory symptoms at study entry. A respiratory virus was detected in 175 (17.5%). The mean duration of hospitalization was 4.2 days (SD 5.4) in the intervention group and 4.1 days (SD 4.9) in the control group (difference 0.1, 95% CI –0.5 to 0.6, p 0.810).

The residues of the β-hairpin motif (residues 138–158), an extension of two β-strands of the C-terminal β-barrel of HAV 3C are critical for the interactions between the enzyme and the tetrapeptide portion of these inhibitors that are analogous to the residues at the P4 to P1 positions in the natural substrates of picornaviral 3C proteinases. Unexpectedly, the Sγ of Cys172 forms two covalent bonds with each inhibitor, yielding an unusual episulfide cation (thiiranium ring) stabilized by a nearby oxyanion. This result suggests a mechanism of inactivation of 3C peptidases by methyl ketone inhibitors that is distinct from that occurring in the structurally related serine proteinases or in the papain-like cysteine peptidases. It also provides insight into the mechanisms underlying both the inactivation of HAV 3C by these inhibitors and on the proteolysis of natural substrates by this viral cysteine peptidase.","Yin, Jiang; Cherney, Maia M.; Bergmann, Ernst M.; Zhang, Jianmin; Huitema, Carly; Pettersson, Hanna; Eltis, Lindsay D.; Vederas, John C.; James, Michael N.G.",Journal of Molecular Biology,30,26

The characteristics of VAP in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on all patients hospitalized for COVID-19 during the first phase of the epidemic in one of the seven ICUs of the Pays-de-Loire region (North-West France) and who were on invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h. We studied the characteristics of VAP in these patients. VAP was diagnosed based on official recommendations, and we included only cases of VAP that were confirmed by a quantitative microbiological culture. FINDINGS: We analyzed data from 188 patients. Of these patients, 48.9% had VAP and 19.7% experienced multiple episodes. Our study showed an incidence of 39.0 VAP per 1000 days of IMV (until the first VAP episode) and an incidence of 33.7 VAP per 1000 days of IMV (including all 141 episodes of VAP). Multi-microbial VAP accounted for 39.0% of all VAP, and 205 pathogens were identified. Enterobacteria accounted for 49.8% of all the isolated pathogens. Bacteremia was associated in 15 (10.6%) cases of VAP. Pneumonia was complicated by thoracic empyema in five cases (3.5%) and by pulmonary abscess in two cases (1.4%). Males were associated with a higher risk of VAP (sHR 2.24 CI95% [1.18; 4.26] p = 0.013). INTERPRETATION: Our study showed an unusually high incidence of VAP in patients admitted to the ICU for severe COVID-19, even though our services were not inundated during the first wave of the epidemic. We also noted a significant proportion of enterobacteria. VAP-associated complications (abscess, empyema) were not exceptional.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) poses a great threat to public health worldwide. However, some parts of the globe have been worse affected in terms of prevalence and deaths than others. The causes and conditions of such variations have yet to be explored. Although some studies indicated a possible correlation between air pollution and COVID‐19 severity, there is yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer. This review summarizes the impact of air pollution on COVID‐19 infections and severity and discusses the possible management strategies and challenges involved. The available literature investigating the correlation between air pollution and COVID‐19 infections and mortality are included in the review. The studies reviewed here suggest that exposure to air pollution, particularly to PM(2.5) and NO(2), is positively correlated with COVID‐19 infections and mortality. Some data indicate that air pollution can play an important role in the airborne transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2. A high percentage of COVID‐19 incidences has been reported in the most polluted areas, where patients needed hospital admission. The available data also show that both short‐term and long‐term air pollution may enhance COVID‐19 severity. However, most of the studies that showed a link between air pollution and COVID‐19 infections and mortality did not consider potential confounders during the correlation analysis. Therefore, more specific studies need to be performed focusing on some additional confounders such as individual age, population density, and pre‐existing comorbidities to determine the impact of air pollution on COVID‐19 infections and deaths.

Cumulative and monthly age-adjusted COVID-19 proportionate hospitalization ratios (aPHRs) were calculated for racial and ethnic minority patients relative to non-Hispanic White patients. Within each of the four U.S. Census regions, the cumulative aPHR was highest for Hispanic or Latino patients (range = 2.7-3.9). Racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 hospitalization were largest during May-July 2020; the peak monthly aPHR among Hispanic or Latino patients was >9.0 in the West and Midwest, >6.0 in the South, and >3.0 in the Northeast. The aPHRs declined for most racial and ethnic groups during July-November 2020 but increased for some racial and ethnic groups in some regions during December.

The study of RNA silencing-mediated antiviral defences in vertebrates is hampered by the overlap with other antiviral mechanisms; thus, heterologous systems are often used to study the interplay between RNA silencing and vertebrate-infecting viruses. In this report we show that the VP3 protein of the avian birnavirus Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) displays, in addition to its capacity to bind long double-stranded RNA, the ability to interact with double-stranded small RNA molecules. We also demonstrate that IBDV VP3 prevents the silencing mediated degradation of a reporter mRNA, and that this silencing suppression activity depends on its RNA binding ability. Furthermore, we find that the anti-silencing activity of IBDV VP3 is shared with the homologous proteins expressed by both insect- and fish-infecting birnaviruses. Finally, we show that IBDV VP3 can functionally replace the well-characterized HCPro silencing suppressor of Plum pox virus, a potyvirus that is unable to infect plants in the absence of an active silencing suppressor. Altogether, our results support the idea that VP3 protects the viral genome from host sentinels, including those of the RNA silencing machinery.","Valli, Adrian; Busnadiego, Idoia; Maliogka, Varvara; Ferrero, Diego; Castón, José R.; Rodríguez, José Francisco; García, Juan Antonio",PLoS One,30,32

The list of identified comorbid conditions includes hematological diseases, with sickle cell disease (SCD) falling into this category. CASE REPORTS: This case series examines the history, presentation, and clinical course of 5 patients with SCD who tested positive for SAR-COV-2 during the spring and summer of 2020. These patients experienced COVID-19 severities ranging from a mild cough and congestion to 8-day hospitalizations requiring blood transfusions. CONCLUSIONS: While there is still a great amount of research on the interaction between COVID-19 and SCD needed, from this study we have concluded that patients with SCD do not always present with the classic COVID-19 triad of cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Often, these patients present with symptoms of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), including severe leg, flank, and chest pain, as was seen in 4 of 5 of our patients. We, and several other researchers, believe that this association between COVID-19 and VOC could be due to COVID-19 triggering inflammatory cytokines (notably IL-6) leading to system-wide inflammation, which induces sickling of the red blood cells. Based on this report, we recommend that SCD patients presenting with VOC who have had exposure to SAR-COV-2 be promptly tested for SAR-COV-2 to guide treatment and reduce mortality and morbidity in this vulnerable population.","Chen-Goodspeed, Amber; Idowu, Modupe",Am J Case Rep,30,24

Collaborative efforts of educators and academic institutions are necessary to facilitate the adaptation to the new educational reality. In this study, challenges and outcomes of a newly implemented distance education curriculum are examined to share findings and provide recommendations. METHODS: An alternative distance education curriculum with online resources and virtual lectures was developed and implemented in February 2020 at the Wasit University College of Medicine in Iraq. A post-implementation survey was developed for both faculty instructors and students to evaluate the program's effectiveness and perception. Results were compared between both groups. The study was approved by the University's Dean and exempted by the research committee for anonymity. RESULTS: A total of 636 students and 81 instructors were surveyed. Approximately 33% of students and 51% of instructors found online education equivalent or superior to traditional face-to-face teaching methods. Almost 69% of students and 51% of instructors reported increased difficulties with virtual learning, primarily due to challenges with the available technology, unreliable internet connectivity, as well as perceive fatigue when listening to online lectures. CONCLUSIONS: Distance education provides a worthwhile alternative during the COVID-19 pandemic, including in regions of limited experience. Adequate preparation, good quality audio-visuals and Internet, and student engagement activities are recommended to improve the quality of education.","Tuma, Faiz; Nassar, Aussama K.; Kamel, Mohamed K.; Knowlton, Lisa M.; Jawad, Naseer Kadhim",Ann Med Surg (Lond),30,12

Herein, a total of 35 novel compounds were chemically synthesized and single crystal of 6–6 was obtained to confirm the molecular structure of this family of compounds. The novel PTB derivatives were fully evaluated against various biological platforms. From the bioassay results, the best AHAS inhibitor 6–22 displayed weaker herbicidal activity but stronger anti-Candida activity than PTB did. For plant pathogenic fungi, 6–26 showed excellent activity at 50 mg/L dosage. Preliminary insecticidal activity and antiviral activity were also observed for some title compounds. Strikingly, 6–5 exhibited a promising inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV M(pro) with IC(50) of 4.471 μM and a low cellular cytotoxicity against mammalian 293 T cells. Based on the results of molecular modeling, HOMO-1 was considered to be a factor that affects AHAS inhibition and a possible binding mode of 6–5 with SARS-CoV M(pro) was predicted. This is the first time that PTB derivatives have been studied as biological agents other than herbicides. The present research hence has suggested that more attentions should be paid to compounds belonging to this family to develop novel agrochemicals or medicines.","Wu, Ren-Jun; Zhou, Kai-Xuan; Yang, Haijin; Song, Guo-Qing; Li, Yong-Hong; Fu, Jia-Xin; Zhang, Xiao; Yu, Shu-Jing; Wang, Li-Zhong; Xiong, Li-Xia; Niu, Cong-Wei; Song, Fu-Hang; Yang, Haitao; Wang, Jian-Guo",Eur J Med Chem,30,2

New avenues of research for natural molecules with desirable properties to alleviate this situation have, therefore, been expanding. Biosurfactants comprise a group of unique and varied amphiphilic molecules of microbial origin capable of interacting with lipidic membranes/components of microorganisms and altering their physicochemical properties. These features have encouraged closer investigations of these microbial metabolites as new pharmaceutics with potential applications in clinical, hygiene and therapeutic fields. Mounting evidence has indicated that biosurfactants have antimicrobial, antibiofilm, antiviral, immunomodulatory and antiproliferative activities that are exploitable in new anticancer treatments and wound healing applications. Some biosurfactants have already been approved for use in clinical, food and environmental fields, while others are currently under investigation and development as antimicrobials or adjuvants to antibiotics for microbial suppression and biofilm eradication strategies.

Furthermore, small glycopeptides derived from egg ZP3 retain full sperm receptor activity, suggesting a role for carbohydrate, rather than polypeptide chain in receptor function. Here, we report that removal of O-linked oligosaccharides from ZP3 destroys its sperm receptor activity, whereas removal of O-linked oligosaccharides has no effect. A specific size class of O-linked oligosaccharides, recovered following mild alkaline hydrolysis and reduction of ZP3, is shown to possess sperm receptor activity and to bind to sperm. The results presented strongly suggest that mouse sperm bind to eggs via O-linked oligosaccharides present on ZP3.","Florman, Harvey M.; Wassarman, Paul M.",Cell,30,33

The crystal structure of Nsp9 of human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E reveals a novel disulfide-linked homodimer, which is very different from the previously reported Nsp9 dimer of SARS coronavirus. In contrast, the structure of the Cys69Ala mutant of HCoV-229E Nsp9 shows the same dimer organization as the SARS-CoV protein. In the crystal, the wild-type HCoV-229E protein forms a trimer of dimers, whereas the mutant and SARS-CoV Nsp9 are organized in rod-like polymers. Chemical cross-linking suggests similar modes of aggregation in solution. In zone-interference gel electrophoresis assays and surface plasmon resonance experiments, the HCoV-229E wild-type protein is found to bind oligonucleotides with relatively high affinity, whereas binding by the Cys69Ala and Cys69Ser mutants is observed only for the longest oligonucleotides. The corresponding mutations in SARS-CoV Nsp9 do not hamper nucleic acid binding. From the crystal structures, a model for single-stranded RNA binding by Nsp9 is deduced. We propose that both forms of the Nsp9 dimer are biologically relevant; the occurrence of the disulfide-bonded form may be correlated with oxidative stress induced in the host cell by the viral infection.","Ponnusamy, Rajesh; Moll, Ralf; Weimar, Thomas; Mesters, Jeroen R.; Hilgenfeld, Rolf",J Mol Biol,30,16

In particular, it was thought that neurons were protected from direct attack by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) because they do not express major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) molecules, at least at steady state. To date, most of our current knowledge on the specifics of neuron-CTL interaction is based on studies artificially inducing MHC I expression on neurons, loading them with exogenous peptide and applying CTL clones or lines often differentiated in culture. Thus, much remains to be uncovered regarding the modalities of the interaction between infected neurons and antiviral CD8 T cells in the course of a natural disease. Here, we used the model of neuroinflammation caused by neurotropic Borna disease virus (BDV), in which virus-specific CTL have been demonstrated as the main immune effectors triggering disease. We tested the pathogenic properties of brain-isolated CD8 T cells against pure neuronal cultures infected with BDV. We observed that BDV infection of cortical neurons triggered a significant up regulation of MHC I molecules, rendering them susceptible to recognition by antiviral CTL, freshly isolated from the brains of acutely infected rats. Using real-time imaging, we analyzed the spatio-temporal relationships between neurons and CTL. Brain-isolated CTL exhibited a reduced mobility and established stable contacts with BDV-infected neurons, in an antigen- and MHC-dependent manner. This interaction induced rapid morphological changes of the neurons, without immediate killing or impairment of electrical activity. Early signs of neuronal apoptosis were detected only hours after this initial contact. Thus, our results show that infected neurons can be recognized efficiently by brain-isolated antiviral CD8 T cells and uncover the unusual modalities of CTL-induced neuronal damage.","Chevalier, Grégoire; Suberbielle, Elsa; Monnet, Céline; Duplan, Valérie; Martin-Blondel, Guillaume; Farrugia, Fanny; Le Masson, Gwendal; Liblau, Roland; Gonzalez-Dunia, Daniel",PLoS Pathog,30,28

Viral disease symptoms result both from direct viral replication within host cells and from indirect immunopathological consequences. Dendritic cells (DCs) are key determinants of viral disease outcome; they activate immune responses during viral infection and direct T cells toward distinct T helper type responses. Certain viruses are able to skew cytokine secretion by DCs inducing and/or downregulating the immune system with the aim of facilitating and prolonging release of progeny. Thus, the interaction of DCs with viruses most often results in the absence of disease or complete recovery when natural functions of DCs prevail, but may lead to chronic illness or death when these functions are outmanoeuvred by viruses in the exploitation of DCs.","Freer, Giulia; Matteucci, Donatella",PLoS Pathog,30,18

RESULTS: We included 244 pregnant women with IBD, of which 75 (30.7%) were on biologics in whom the treatment was stopped in 29.3% at a median 28 weeks gestation. In addition, 9% of patients were on corticosteroids and 21.5% continued on thiopurines. The care provided during 460 patient encounters was not affected by the pandemic in 94.1% but 68.2% were performed via telephone (compared with 3% prepandemic practice; p<0.0001). One-hundred-ten women delivered 111 alive babies (mean 38.2 weeks gestation, mean birth weight 3324 g) with 12 (11.0%) giving birth before week 37. Birth occurred by vaginal delivery in 72 (56.4%) and by caesarean section in 48 (43.6%) cases. Thirty-three were elective (12 for IBD indications) and 15 emergency caesarean sections. Breast feeding rates were low (38.6%). Among 244 pregnant women with IBD, 1 suspected COVID-19 infection was recorded. CONCLUSION: IBD antenatal care adjustments during the COVID-19 pandemic have not negatively affected patient care. Despite high levels of immunosuppression, only a single COVID-19 infection occurred. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were infrequent.","Selinger, Christian Philipp; Fraser, Aileen; Collins, Paul; Gunn, Melanie; Chew, Thean Soon; Kerry, Georgina; Patel, Kamal V; Roysam, Maya; Bel Kok, Klaartje; Bancil, Aaron; Hall, Veronica; Cooney, Rachel; Smith, Lyn; Steed, Helen; Segal, Jonathan; Kent, Alexandra; Limdi, Jimmy; Sebastian, Shaji",BMJ Open Gastroenterol,30,16

The first studies in China showed that cancer patients had a higher risk of becoming infected and dying. Other risk factors for mortality were age over 65 years, male sex, the presence of comorbidity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Data on the specific behavior of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) in the pandemic are scarce. The mechanisms by which MM patients may have a higher mortality are multiple, derived both from the disease itself due to cellular and humoral immunity deficiency as well as from anti-myeloma treatment. The present study aims to establish the behavior of the disease in the pandemic period in Latin America. Methods This is a retrospective case series of in and outpatients with a diagnosis of MM and COVID-19 reported from centers from Latin America between March and July 31, 2020. The analysis of demographic, clinical, laboratory, complications and therapy variables were done using descriptive statistics. A Kaplan Meier survival analysis was performed, with Log Rank statistic. Finally, a Cox regression was performed to identify independent risk factors of worse outcome. Pre-admission characteristics, MM status, and comorbidities constituted the reference model and were used to adjust the association of relevant MM characteristics with mortality. Program used for analysis was SPSS statistics 25. Results Fifty-two patients with COVID-19 and MM from 7 countries were included. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, infection baseline clinical conditions, treatment, and outcomes are shown in Table 1. The characteristics in terms of MM status are shown in Table 2. When performing the survival analysis, it is evidenced that the survival of the entire cohort at day 49 was 67% Figure 1. When we focus on patients with comorbidities, survival drops to 53.5% +/- 10.6 (CI 95% 53.4 - 99.4 and p value of 0.041) for the same day Figure 2. When performing the obesity analysis, a drop in survival of up to 39% was observed (95% CI 24.448 - 56.76, with p = 0.00001) Figure 3. Adjusted HR for obesity is 5,078 (95% CI 1,389-18,558, α0.014) and mechanical ventilation with a HR of 3,943 (95% CI - 1,296 - 11,998, α0.016) When comparing patients with controlled MM (> PR) versus uncontrolled, the mortality rate was 84% versus 58% respectively (p = 0.109). Comorbidities (presence of either diabetes, arterial hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or “others”), obesity, need of mechanical ventilation, and <VGPR at the time of infection were independent factors of lower survival Table 3. Conclusions Patients with MM and COVID-19 has an overall mortality of approximately 30% and this is strongly influenced by the presence of comorbidities, uncontrolled disease and need of mechanical ventilation. Survival of patients without comorbidities and controlled disease is good, suggesting that this group of patients would not require modification of MM therapy. The main limitations of our study are its retrospective nature and the low number of patients. It must be highlighted that at the time of the analysis most of Latin American countries were still in the peak of the pandemic. Prospective studies are required to elucidate the behavior of these risk factors in mortality, to optimize the management of patients with MM in this period of the SARS CoV-2 / COVID-19 pandemic.

We empirically investigate the co-movements and the causal relationships among real GDP, tourism development, and the real exchange rate in a multivariate model. We use two different tourism variables—international tourism receipts and number of international tourist arrivals. To employ the unit root tests and the cointegration tests allowing for a structural break, the empirical evidence clearly shows that the causality between tourism and economic growth is bi-directional. Lastly, the international and cross-strait political change, economic shocks, and the relaxing of some tourism control and policies would break down the stability of the relationships between tourism development and economic growth. Overall, we do find the structural breakpoints, and they look to match clearly with the corresponding critical economic, political, or tourist incidents.","Lee, Chien-Chiang; Chien, Mei-Se",Math Comput Simul,30,32

Previously reported results from our international survey of oncology clinicians, conducted through March-April 2020, found that clinicians reported altering management in both the curative and palliative settings and not in proportion to the COVID-19 case burden in their region of practice. This follow-up survey, conducted from 27(th) September to 7(th) November 2020, aimed to explore how attitudes and practices evolved over the 2020 pandemic period. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Participants were medical, radiation and surgical oncologist and trainees. Surveys were distributed electronically via ESMO and other collaborating professional societies. Participants were asked to compare their practice prior to the pandemic to both the period of March-April 2020, referred to as the ‘early’ period, and the current survey period, referred to as the ‘later’ period. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-two oncology clinicians completed the survey. The majority of respondents were medical oncologists (n = 136, 79%) and many were from Europe (n = 82, 48%). In the ‘early’ period, 88% (n = 133) of clinicians reported altering their practice compared to 63% (n = 96) in the ‘later’ period. Compared to prior to the pandemic, clinicians reported fewer new patient presentations in the ‘early’ period and a trend towards more patients presenting with advanced disease in the ‘later’ period. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate a swing back towards pre-COVID-19 practices despite an increase in the rate of cumulative COVID-19 cases across 2020. The impact of these changes on cancer associated morbidity and mortality remains to be measured over the months and years to come.","Chazan, G.; Franchini, F.; Alexander, M.; Banerjee, S.; Mileshkin, L.; Blinman, P.; Zielinski, R.; Karikios, D.; Pavlakis, N.; Peters, S.; Lordick, F.; Ball, D.; Wright, G.; IJzerman, M.; Solomon, B.J.",ESMO Open,30,21

However, due to current events, the “Year of Corona” will be remembered more. A positive aspect is the attention and appreciation of the nursing profession in the population. Nevertheless, politicians and various professional groups in the hospital limit nursing care almost exclusively to practical activities that are directly necessary for the patients. A clearly noticeable improvement in working conditions for nurses as a result of the political efforts of this legislative period has so far failed to materialise to the same extent as the active involvement of nurses in political decisions and resolutions that directly affect the professional group. The rapid build-up of bed capacities has made it possible to provide the patients concerned with the necessary intensive medical care. In many places, however, this has been at the expense of the nurses and physicians, some of whom have had to work without the necessary training, with insufficient protective equipment and in unfamiliar areas. These problems continue to exist even after months of the covid-19 crisis. The Nursing Section of the DGIIN expressly declares its willingness to actively and constructively participate in any processes in the future and, with the following 5 points, offers initial practical assistance to improve the situation in German intensive care units.","Hermes, Carsten; Ochmann, Tobias",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,30,8

The ability to recognize and potentially intervene early in those patients at greatest risk of developing this complication could be of great clinical utility. Methods: We performed detailed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 28 COVID-19 patients treated at Xian No.8 Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict severity of disease and patient outcome. Findings: While we did not detect significant differences in the number of monocytes between patients with COVID-19 and normal healthy individuals,we did identify significant morphological and functional differences, which are more pronounced in patients requiring prolonged hospitalization and ICU admission. Patients with COVID-19 have larger than normal monocytes, easily identified on forward scatter, side scatter analysis by routine flow cytometry,with the presence of a distinct population of monocytes with high forward scatter (FSC-high). On more detailed analysis, these FSC-high monocytes are CD11b+, CD14+, CD16+, CD68+, CD80+, CD163+, CD206+ and secrete IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha, consistent with an inflammatory phenotype. Conclusions: The detection and serial monitoring of this subset of inflammatory monocytes using flow cytometry could be of great help in guiding the prognostication and treatment of patients with COVID-19 and merits further evaluation.","Zhang, Dan; Guo, Rui; Lei, Lei; Liu, Hongjuan; Wang, Yawen; Wang, Yili; Dai, Tongxin; Zhang, Tianxiao; Lai, Yanjun; Wang, Jingya; Liu, Zhiqiang; He, Aili; O'Dwyer, Michael; Hu, Jinsong",,30,26

Here we conducted a multicenter retrospective study involving patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia to investigate the utility of chest computed tomography (CT) and clinical characteristics to risk-stratify the patients. Our results show that CT severity score is associated with inflammatory levels and that older age, higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and CT severity score on admission are independent risk factors for short-term progression. The nomogram based on these risk factors shows good calibration and discrimination in the derivation and validation cohorts. These findings have implications for predicting the progression risk of COVID-19 pneumonia patients at the time of admission.

Most of the recommended precautionary measures are dependent on human behaviors and therefore their effectiveness largely depends on peoples' perception and attitudes toward the disease. This study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, risk perception, and precautionary measures taken in response to COVID-19 in North America. Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, an online survey targeted to North Americans focused on the public's knowledge of COVID-19, risk perception, and precautionary behaviors taken in response to this pandemic. Descriptive analyses were performed for the whole population and the subgroup analyses contrasted the differences between Americans and Canadians. Results: The cohort comprised 1,264 relatively young participants with an average age of 28.6 ± 9.8 years. The vast majority (>90%) were knowledgeable about COVID-19. Regarding risk perception, about a quarter assumed to be at less risk to contract the disease, and 42.8% considered themselves to be less contagious than others. While the vast majority avoided performing risky behaviors, only a small proportion (13.2%) wore a face mask—which is in line with the public health recommendations of the two countries at the time of data collection. Overall, a larger proportion of Canadian participants (55.8%) were satisfied with the performance of their national public health in response to the current pandemic, compared to their American counterparts (12.2%). Discussion: Data regarding the public's knowledge of COVID-19, risk perception, and behaviors in response to this pandemic is limited. The results of this study highlight that this relatively young and educated sample of North Americans had a high level of knowledge about COVID-19 and a large proportion of them were taking the precautionary measures against this pandemic. However, a significant number of individuals believe to be at less risk of contracting the disease compared to the general population. Educating the public that no one is safe from this disease, could play a role in further limiting risky behaviors and ultimately facilitating disease containment.","Salimi, Ali; ElHawary, Hassan; Diab, Nermin; Smith, Lee",Front Public Health,30,32

With the advent of aging society, palatable and healthy foods are required to improve the quality of life and reduce the burden of finance for medical expenditure. Food hydrocolloids can contribute to this demand by versatile functions such as thickening, gelling, stabilising, and emulsifying, controlling texture and flavour release in food processing. Molar mass effects on viscosity and diffusion in liquid foods, and on mechanical and other physical properties of solid and semi-solid foods and films are overviewed. In these functions, the molar mass is one of the key factors, and therefore, the effects of molar mass on various health problems related to noncommunicable diseases or symptoms such as cancer, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, constipation, high blood pressure, knee pain, osteoporosis, cystic fibrosis and dysphagia are described. Understanding these problems only from the viewpoint of molar mass is limited since other structural characteristics, conformation, branching, blockiness in copolymers such as pectin and alginate, degree of substitution as well as the position of the substituents are sometimes the determining factor rather than the molar mass. Nevertheless, comparison of different behaviours and functions in different polymers from the viewpoint of molar mass is expected to be useful to find a common characteristics, which may be helpful to understand the mechanism in other problems.","Nishinari, Katsuyoshi; Fang, Yapeng",Food Hydrocoll,30,20

The relative contribution of viruses in acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) is, however, poorly documented in Lao PDR. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the etiology of ALRI in patients of all ages in two hospitals of Laos. METHODS: Multiplex PCR/RT‐PCR methods were used to target 18 major common respiratory viruses. Between August 2009 and October 2010, samples from 292 patients presenting with ALRI were collected. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Viruses were detected in 162 (55%) samples. In 48% (140/292) of the total ALRI cases, a single virus was detected while coinfections were observed in 8% (22/292) of the samples. The most frequent viruses were rhinovirus/enterovirus (35%), human respiratory syncytial virus (26%), and influenza viruses (13%). Parainfluenza viruses were detected in 9%, adenovirus in 6%, human metapneumovirus in 4%, coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1) in 4%, and bocavirus in 3% of ALRI specimens. Most viral infections occurred in patients below 5 years of age. The distribution of viruses varied according to age‐groups. No significant correlation was observed between the severity of the disease and the age of patients or the virus species. This study provides the description of viral etiology among patients presenting with ALRI in Lao PDR.

Here we present the results of a survey to gain the perception of IBD specialists in their patient-management using telemedicine in their daily practice. Methods: This was an observational survey study among physicians focused on IBD (gastroenterologist, surgeons, and pediatricians) members of the Spanish Working Group on Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis (GETECCU), the Spanish Association of Gastroenterology (AEG), and the Spanish Association of Coloproctology (AECP), regarding changes of management of IBD patients. Results: We received a total of 269 responses to the survey (from May to June 2020). Before the pandemic, nearly all the respondents reported performing very frequently their visits face-to-face (n=251, 93.3%) while, during the pandemic, the telephone visits were the most frequent visits performed (n=138, 51,3%). Regarding communication difficulties, 157 (58.4%) respondents reported the impossibility of performing a proper examination as the most relevant issue. Also, 114 (42.4%) respondents considered remote visits more time-consuming than face-to-face visits. Most gastroenterologists (n=188, 83.2%) considered patients with active perianal disease in special need of face-to-face consultation and more than half of the surgeons (n=35, 50.7%) reported having performed an immediate postoperative follow-up remotely. Conclusions: Most IBD units have implemented remote visits during the pandemic, but most professionals found them more time-consuming and unsuitable for some disease profiles. Therefore, there is a need for the development of better telemedicine systems that can meet professionals’ and patients´ requirements.","Hoyo, Javier Del; Millán, Mónica; Garrido-Marín, Alejandro; Nos, Pilar; Acosta, Manuel Barreiro-de; Bujanda, Luis; de la Portilla, Fernando; Aguas, Mariam",Gastroenterol Hepatol,30,28

We aimed to determine the benefits of corticosteroids on those outcomes in pediatric populations. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and reference lists of articles from inception until February 2019. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies on the efficacy of systemic corticosteroid administration given prior to elective extubation in mechanically ventilated pediatrics were eligible. Outcomes included post-extubation stridor indicating laryngeal edema and extubation failures. RESULTS: A total of ten randomized controlled trials with 591 pediatric patients were included: seven of the ten studies for post-extubation stridor/suspected upper airway obstruction and nine of the ten studies for extubation failure. The estimate of pooled odds ratios (ORs) for post-extubation stridor/suspected upper airway obstruction was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.21–0.79). When analysis was restricted to trials that had explicit data for infants and explicit data for pediatric patients under 5 years old excluding infants, the estimates of pooled ORs were 0.53 (95% CI: 0.20–1.40) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.38–1.22), respectively. For pediatric patients who received corticosteroids, there was a 0.37-fold lower odds of extubation failure than that in pediatric patients who did not receive corticosteroids (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22–0.61). While three observational studies were included in this review, their estimates have a potential for bias and we did not perform a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a relatively small sample size in each randomized controlled trial and wide ranges of ages and steroid administration regimens, our results suggest that the use of corticosteroids for prevention of post-extubation stridor and extubation failure could be considered to be acceptable in pediatric patients.","Kimura, Satoshi; Ahn, JiYoon B.; Takahashi, Mai; Kwon, Sohee; Papatheodorou, Stefania",Ann Intensive Care,30,20

During this period, the fellow had the unique opportunity to gain experience in different fields of risk assessment, namely how to conduct a systematic review, to assess the risk of microbiological and chemical hazards, to make use of modelling tools for exposure assessment and risk prioritisation, to write scientific reports for committees and networks at the national level and to understand the role of social science in risk assessment. In addition, the fellow was able to attend several meetings, seminars, courses and workshops that helped him to gain further insight in the field of food science. The complete programme enabled a fast learning curve that allowed the fellow to have an overview of the different tools that can be employed in the wide field of food safety risk assessment, in order to acquire skills and competences that can be used in his future career.","Lorenzoni, Andrea; Tsoulli, Chara; McCarthy (APHA), Catherine; Adkin, Amie",EFSA J,30,22

This form of distance education differs from conventional distance education: being suddenly, unreadily and forcefully implemented, invading schooling and constituting a globally discussed phenomenon. This article builds a conceptual framework for this education, addressing the question: What are the ramifications of implementing distance education amid coronavirus? It targets Arab culture, although globalisation and the media may have harmonised any substantial cross-cultural variations. Various ramifications have emerged through analysing social-media posts, online classes and interviews. Concerning social and cultural ramifications, some may, for ideological considerations, tolerate, support, reject or subvert this education through campaigning, rumour and humour. Regarding pedagogical and psychological ramifications, unreadiness and incompetence may compromise education. Additionally, staying home may entail problems (pandemic-related stress, anxiety, depression, domestic violence, divorce and pregnancy), preventing students and teachers from learning and teaching. Concerning procedural and logistical ramifications, some Arab contexts may be digitally readier than non-Arab contexts. Additionally, stakeholders may intensify efforts to profit, ethically or unethically, from the over-demand for this education. Distance education is one of several social distancing initiatives, which Arabs have welcomed despite their well-rooted social closeness, bonding to debond, forming unorthodox ‘distanceship’.","Al Lily, Abdulrahman Essa; Ismail, Abdelrahim Fathy; Abunasser, Fathi Mohammed; Alhajhoj Alqahtani, Rafdan Hassan",Technol Soc,30,28

Current therapies used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include monoclonal antibody cocktail, convalescent plasma, antivirals, immunomodulators, and anticoagulants. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have recently been authorized for emergency use, which are invaluable for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their long-term side effects are not yet documented, and populations with immunocompromised conditions (e.g., organ-transplantation and immunodeficient patients) may not be able to mount an effective immune response. In addition, there are concerns that wide-scale immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may introduce immune pressure that could select for escape mutants to the existing vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies. Emerging evidence has shown that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)- natural killer (NK) immunotherapy has potent antitumor response in hematologic cancers with minimal adverse effects in recent studies, however, the potentials of CAR-NK cells in treating COVID-19 has not yet been fully exploited. Here, we improve upon a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its various mutants. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of S309 (henceforward, S309-CAR-NK), a SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAbs) that targets the highly conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and is therefore more likely to recognize different variants of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus and its D614G, N501Y, and E484K mutants. Furthermore, S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill target cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein in vitro and show superior killing activity and cytokine production, compared to that of the recently reported CR3022-CAR-NK cells. Thus, these results pave the way for generating ‘off-the-shelf’ S309-CAR-NK cells for treatment in high-risk individuals as well as provide an alternative strategy for patients unresponsive to current vaccines.","Ma, Minh Tuyet; Badeti, Saiaditya; Chen, Chih-Hsiung; Kim, James; Choudhary, Alok; Honnen, Bill; Reichman, Charles; Calianese, David; Pinter, Abraham; Jiang, Qingkui; Shi, Lanbo; Zhou, Renping; Xu, Huanbin; Li, Qingsheng; Gause, William; Liu, Dongfang",Front Immunol,30,1

Certain infectious diseases and vaccines have been described to induce changes in the immune components of HM. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort single-institution study from February 2 to April 4, 2021. Women who reported to be breastfeeding at the time of their coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination were invited to participate. Blood and milk samples were collected on day 14 after their second dose of the vaccine. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against nucleocapsid protein as well as IgG, immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against the spike 1 protein receptor-binding domain against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD-S1) were analyzed in both serum and HM samples. RESULTS: Most of the participants (ie, 94%) received the BNT162b2 messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine. The mean serum concentration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD-S-IgG antibodies in vaccinated individuals was 3379.6 ± 1639.5 binding antibody units per mL. All vaccinated study participants had anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD-S1-IgG, and 89% of them had anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD-S-IgA in their milk. The antibody concentrations in the milk of mothers who were breastfeeding 24 months were significantly higher than in mothers with breastfeeding periods <24 months (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We found a clear association between COVID-19 vaccination and specific immunoglobulin concentrations in HM. This effect was more pronounced when lactation periods exceeded 23 months. The influence of the lactation period on immunoglobulins was specific and independent of other variables.","Ramìreza, Dolores Sabina Romero; Pérez, Marìa Magdalena Lara; Pérez, Mercedes Carretero; Isis, Marìa; Hernández, Suárez; Hospital, Saúl Martìn Pulido; Villacampa, Lorena Pera; Vilar, Ana Marìa Fernández; Falero, Mónica Rivero; Carretero, Paloma González; Millán, Beatriz Reyes; Roper, Sabine; Bello, Miguel Ángel Garcìa",Pediatrics,30,1

Eleven burns were caused by treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Patients delayed seeking medical attention due to concern of catching COVID-19 (36% adults, 8% children). There was a delay in referral of 17 patients despite them fulfilling the referral criteria. Infection rates were higher following delayed presentation (21% vs 6%). The majority of burns were managed conservatively (237/258). Dressing changes were performed at home by 32% of patients. The outreach team treated 22 patients. During the pandemic telemedicine has improved the efficiency of outpatient burn care and outreach nurses have enabled treatment of vulnerable patients.

A hierarchical annotation schema based on the OMOP Common Data Model was developed to accommodate four levels of annotation granularity: i.e., study cohort, eligibility criteria, named entity and standard concept. In COVIC, 39 trials with more than one study cohorts were identified and labelled with an identifier for each cohort. 1,943 criteria for non-clinical characteristics such as “informed consent”, “exclusivity of participation” were annotated. 9767 criteria were represented by 18,161 entities in 8 domains, 7,743 attributes of 7 attribute types and 16,443 relationships of 11 relationship types. 17,171 entities were mapped to standard medical concepts and 1,009 attributes were normalized into computable representations.

Without a vaccine, there is thus an urgent need to identify potential modifiable risk factors which can help manage overall fatality or recovery rates. Case fatality rates are highly variable between (and even within) nations; nutritional differences have been proposed to account significantly for this disparity. Indeed, vitamin B12 deficiency is a common denominator between the elderly and those with diabetes. The question on hand thus lies on whether managing B12 deficiencies will impact COVID-19 fatality outcome or recovery rates.

Designing a simple and inexpensive device with the ability to increase the number of patients that can be connected to existing ventilators would have a major impact on the number of lives that could be saved. We conducted a study to determine whether two pigs with significant differences in size and weight could be ventilated simultaneously using a single ventilator connected to a new medical device called DuplicARⓇ. METHODS: Six pigs (median weight 12 kg, range 9–25 kg) were connected in pairs to a single ventilator using the new device for 6 hours. Both the ventilator and the device were manipulated throughout the experiment according to the needs of each animal. Tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure were individually controlled with the device. Primary and secondary outcome variables were defined to assess ventilation and hemodynamics in all animals throughout the experiment. RESULTS: Median difference in weight between the animals of each pair was 67% (range: 11–108). All animals could be successfully oxygenated and ventilated for 6 hours through manipulation of the ventilator and the DuplicARⓇ device, despite significant discrepancies in body size and weight. Mean PaCO(2) in arterial blood was 42.1 ± 4.4 mmHg, mean PaO(2) was 162.8 ± 46.8 mmHg, and mean oxygen saturation was 98 ± 1.3%. End-tidal CO(2) values showed no statistically significant difference among subjects of each pair. Mean difference in arterial PaCO(2) measured at the same time in both animals of each pair was 4.8 ± 3 mmHg, reflecting the ability of the device to ventilate each animal according to its particular requirements. Independent management of PEEP was achieved by manipulation of the device controllers. CONCLUSION: It is possible to ventilate two lung-healthy animals with a single ventilator according to each one's needs through manipulation of both the ventilator and the DuplicARⓇ device. This gives this device the potential to expand local ventilators surge capacity during disasters or pandemics until emergency supplies can be delivered from central stockpiles.","Lugones, Ignacio; Orofino Giambastiani, Roberto; Robledo, Oscar; Marcos, Martín; Mouly, Javier; Gallo, Agustín; Laulhé, Verónica; Biancolini, María Fernanda",Anesthesiol Res Pract,30,16

RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the effect of portable HEPA filtering on aerosol concentration during exercise testing and its efficiency in reducing room clearance time in a clinical exercise testing laboratory? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects were six healthy volunteers aged 20 to 56 years. In the first experiment, exercise was performed in a small tent with controlled airflow with the use of a stationary cycle, portable HEPA filter with fume hood, and particle counter to document aerosol concentration. Subjects performed a four-stage maximal exercise test that lasted 12 min plus 5 min of pretest quiet breathing and 3 min of active recovery. First, they exercised without mitigation then with portable HEPA filter running. In a separate experiment, room aerosol clearance time was measured in a clinical exercise testing laboratory by filling it with artificially generated aerosols and measuring time to 99.9% aerosol clearance with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) only or HVAC plus portable HEPA filter running. RESULTS: In the exercise experiment, particle concentrations reached 1,722 ± 1,484/L vs 96 ± 124/L (P < .04) for all particles (>0.3 μm), 1,339 ± 1,281/L vs 76 ± 104/L (P < .05) for smaller particles (0.3 to 1.0 μm), and 333 ± 209/L vs 17 ± 19/L (P < .01) for larger particles (1.0 to 5.0 μm) at the end of the protocol in a comparison of mitigation vs portable HEPA filter. Use of a portable HEPA filter in a clinical exercise laboratory clearance experiment reduced aerosol clearance time 47% vs HVAC alone. INTERPRETATION: The portable HEPA filter reduced the concentration of aerosols generated during exercise testing by 96% ± 2% for all particle sizes and reduced aerosol room clearance time in clinical exercise testing laboratories. Portable HEPA filters therefore might be useful in clinical exercise testing laboratories to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.","Garzona-Navas, Andrés; Sajgalik, Pavol; Csécs, Ibolya; Askew, J.

One of their prominent activities is the antimicrobial/antiviral activities, which are much apparent when the key functional structural moieties of both of them meet into the same compounds. The current COVID-19 pandemic motivated us to computationally screen and evaluate our library of previously-synthesized 2-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles against the major SARS-CoV-2 protein targets. Interestingly, few ligands showed promising low binding free energies (potent inhibitory interactions/affinities) with the active sites of some coronaviral-2 enzymes, specially the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nCoV-RdRp). One of them was 5,5'-{5,5'-[(1R,2R)-1,2-dihydroxyethane-1,2-diyl]bis(1,3,4-oxadiazole-5,2-diyl)}dibenzene-1,2,3-triol (Taroxaz-104), which showed significantly low binding energies (-10.60 and -9.10 kcal/mol) with nCoV-RdRp-RNA and nCoV-RdRp alone, respectively. These binding energies are even considerably lower than those of remdesivir potent active metabolite GS-443902 (which showed -9.20 and -7.90 kcal/mol with the same targets, respectively). Further computational molecular investigation revealed that Taroxaz-104 molecule strongly inhibits one of the potential active sites of nCoV-RdRp (the one with which GS-443902 molecule mainly interacts), since it interacts with at least seven major active amino acid residues of its predicted pocket. The successful repurposing of Taroxaz-104 has been achieved after the promising results of the anti-COVID-19 biological assay were obtained, as the data showed that Taroxaz-104 exhibited very significant anti-COVID-19 activities (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC(50) = 0.42 μM) with interesting effectiveness against the new strains/variants of SARS-CoV-2. Further investigations for the development of Taroxaz-104 and its coming polyphenolic 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives as anti-COVID-19 drugs, through in vivo bioevaluations and clinical trials research, are urgently needed.","Rabie, Amgad M.",Chem Biol Interact,30,10

Our study aimed to evaluate the clinical assessment tools that best predict mortality risk following hip fracture for patients with CKD. METHODS: Patients with CKD G3b-5D admitted to Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, U.K. between June 2013 and Dec 2019 were included. The association between CKD and post-fracture mortality risk was evaluated. All patients were assessed using tools that evaluated frailty status, co-morbidity, pre-operative risk, functional status and cardiopulmonary fitness. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to determine the prognostic accuracy of the assessment tools for 30 day and 1 year mortality following hip fracture in patients with CKD. RESULTS: 397 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria with a mean age of 83.5 ± 9.2 years. Older age, female sex, intracapsular fracture and more severe CKD, co-morbidity and frailty status were all associated with an increased mortality risk. Patients with dialysis-dependent CKD and severe/very severe frailty had a hazard ratio for mortality of 2.55 (95% Cl 2.11–2.98) and 3.11 (95% Cl 2.47–3.93), respectively. The Clinical Frailty Scale demonstrated the best prognostic accuracy for both 30 day [Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.91, 95% Cl 0.84–0.97] and 1 year mortality (AUC 0.93, 95% Cl 0.87–1.00).

A 41-d experiment was conducted in a commercial wean-to-finish barn; 1,300 piglets weaned at 21 d of age (weaned 2 or 4 d prior to experiment; 6.14 ± 0.18 kg BW; PIC 1050 sows and multiple sire lines) were blocked by sire, sex, and weaning date, then assigned to eight treatments: four dietary treatments each evaluated across two group sizes. The four dietary treatments were: negative control (NC), positive control (PC; NC + in-feed antibiotics), zinc oxide plus a dietary acidifier (blend of fumaric, citric, lactic, and phosphoric acid) (ZA; NC + ZnO + acid), and a Bacillus-based direct-fed-microbial (DFM) plus resistant potato starch (RS) (DR; NC + DFM + RS). The two group sizes were 31 or 11 pigs/pen; floor space was modified so area/pig was equal between the group sizes (0.42 m(2)/pig). There were 7 pens/diet with 11 pigs/pen and 8 pens/diet with 31 pigs/pen. Data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design with pen as the experimental unit. Diagnostic assessment of oral fluids, serum, and tissue samples was used to characterize health status. Pigs experienced natural challenges of acute diarrhea and septicemia in week 1 and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in weeks 4–6. There was a significant interaction between diet and group size for ADG (P = 0.012). PC increased ADG in large and small groups (P < 0.05) and ZA increased ADG only in large groups (P < 0.05). Small groups had improved ADG compared to large groups when fed NC or DR diets (P < 0.05). Similarly, PC increased ADFI (P < 0.05). Compared to NC, ZA improved ADFI in large groups only (P < 0.05; diet × group size: P = 0.015). Pigs fed PC had greater G:F than NC (P < 0.05), and small groups had greater G:F than large groups (P < 0.05). There was no effect of ZA or DR on G:F. Pigs fed PC required fewer individual medical treatments than NC and pigs fed ZA were intermediate (P = 0.024). More pigs were removed from large than small groups (P = 0.049), and there was no effect of diet on removals (P > 0.10). In conclusion, careful study design, protocol implementation, sample collection, and recording of important information allowed us to characterize the health status of this group of pigs and determine treatment effects on growth performance and morbidity.","Olsen, Kristin M; Gabler, Nicholas K; Rademacher, Chris J; Schwartz, Kent J; Schweer, Wesley P; Gourley, Gene G; Patience, John F",Transl Anim Sci,30,14

Method: The data on the total number of non-emergency medical cares (including the number of out-patient clinic attendances, the number of patients who were hospitalized in non-intensive care wards, and patients who underwent elective cardiac intervention procedures) and emergency medical cares [including the number of emergency department (ED attendances) and chest pain center (CPC attendances), as well as the number of patients who were hospitalized in coronary care unit (CCU) and the number of patients who underwent emergency cardiac intervention procedures] before and during the pandemic (time before the pandemic: 20th January 2019 to 31st March 2019 and time during the pandemic: 20th January 2020 to 31st March 2020) in the Department of Cardiology and Macrovascular Disease, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University were collected and compared. Results: Both the non-emergency medical and emergency medical cares were affected by the pandemic. The total number of out-patient clinic attendance decreased by 44.8% and the total number of patients who were hospitalized in non-intensive care wards decreased by 56.4%. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the number of out-patient clinic attendance per day was not associated with the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases and the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Beijing (r = −0.080, p = 0.506 and r = −0.071, p = 0.552, respectively). The total number of patients who underwent non-emergency cardiac intervention procedures decreased during the pandemic, although there were no statistically significant differences except for patent foramen ovale (PFO) occlusion (1.7 ± 2.9 vs. 8.3 ± 2.3, p = 0.035). As for the emergency medical cares, the ED attendances decreased by 22.4%, the total number of CPC attendances increased by 10.3%, and the number of patients who were hospitalized in CCU increased by 8.9%: these differences were not statistically significant. During the pandemic, the proportion of hospitalized patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) significantly increased (19.0 vs. 8.7%, p < 0.001; 28.8 vs. 18.0%, p < 0.001, respectively); also, the number of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) increased by 10.3%. There was no significant difference between patients before and during the pandemic regarding the age, gender, baseline and discharge medication therapy, as well as length of stay and in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: Our preliminary results demonstrate that both the non-emergency and emergency medical cares were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic even in a referral medical center with low cross-infection risk. The number of the out-patient clinic attendances not associated with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases could be due to different factors, such as the local government contamination measures. The proportion of hospitalized patients with acute myocardial infarction increased in our center during the pandemic since other hospitals stopped performing primary angioplasty. A hub-and-spoke model could be effective in limiting the collateral damage for patients affected by cardiovascular diseases when the medical system is stressed by disasters, such as COVID-19 pandemic.","Nan, Jing; Zhang, Tong; Tian, Yali; Song, Ke; Li, Qun; Fu, Qiang; Ma, Yan; Jin, Zening",Front Cardiovasc Med,30,24

Underdetection is acknowledged and is problematic when attempting to capture the true prevalence. Seroprevalence studies, where blood samples from a population sample are tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that react to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, are a common method for estimating the proportion of people previously infected with the virus in a given population. However, obtaining reliable estimates from seroprevalence studies is challenging for a number of reasons, and the uncertainty in the results is often overlooked by scientists, policy makers, and the media. This paper reviews the methodological issues that arise in designing these studies, and the main sources of uncertainty that affect the results. We discuss the choice of study population, recruitment of subjects, uncertainty surrounding the accuracy of antibody tests, and the relationship between antibodies and infection over time. Understanding these issues can help the reader to interpret and critically evaluate the results of seroprevalence studies.","McConnell, David; Hickey, Conor; Bargary, Norma; Trela-Larsen, Lea; Walsh, Cathal; Barry, Michael; Adams, Roisin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,30,16

Real-time RT-PCR assays detect non-viable virus and cell culture differentiates viable virus but it takes several weeks and is labor-intensive. Subgenomic RNAs may reflect replication-competent virus. We therefore evaluated the usefulness of subgenomic RNAs for diagnosing viable SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with various severities of confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled at a tertiary hospital between February and December 2020. RT-PCR assay results for genomic and subgenomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, and saliva specimens were compared with cell culture results. RESULTS: A total 189 specimens from 20 COVID-19 patients were tested in genomic and subgenomic PCR assays, and cultured on Vero cells. Of these 189 samples, 62 (33%) gave positive culture results, 93 (49%) negative results, and the remaining 34 (18%) indeterminate results. Compared with cell culture results, the sensitivities of genomic RNA and subgenomic RNA of the N and S genes were comparable as 100%, but the specificity of subgenomic RNA (N, 65% and S, 68%) was higher than that of genomic RNA (N, 23% and S, 17%, p value < 0.001). The mean durations of positive culture and subgenomic RNA were 11.39 ± 10.34 and 13.75 ± 11.22 days after symptom onset (p value = 0.437), respectively, while that of genomic RNA was 22.85 ± 11.83 days after symptom onset (p value < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our comparison of subgenomic RNA detection with symptom duration and SARS-CoV-2 culture positivity provides a significant advancement on the transmissibility-based approach beyond the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, and warrants further studies on the development of better diagnostic strategy.","Kim, Ji Yeun; Bae, Joon-Yong; Bae, Seongman; Cha, Hye Hee; Kwon, Ji-Soo; Suh, Mi Hyun; Lee, Hyun Jung; Jung, Jiwon; Kim, Min Jae; Cui, Chunguang; Park, Heedo; Lee, Jungmin; Park, Man-Seong; Kim, Sung-Han",Clin Microbiol Infect,30,30

The central issue of survey site reduction, however, has often been addressed only qualitatively. Cluster analysis offers an innovative means of identifying the most representative survey sites among a set of original survey sites. In this paper, we present a general methodology for finding representative sites for an intended study, potentially applicable to any collection of data about dialects or linguistic variation. We elaborate the quantitative steps of the proposed methodology in the context of the “Linguistic Atlas of Japan” (LAJ). Next, we demonstrate the full application of the methodology on the “Linguistic Atlas of German-speaking Switzerland” (Germ.: “Sprachatlas der Deutschen Schweiz”—SDS), with the explicit aim of selecting survey sites corresponding to the aims of the current project “Swiss German Dialects Across Time and Space” (SDATS), which revisits SDS 70 years later. We find that depending on the circumstances and requirements of a study, the proposed methodology, introducing cluster analysis into the survey site reduction process, allows for a greater objectivity in comparison to traditional approaches. We suggest, however, that the suitability of any set of candidate survey sites resulting from the proposed methodology be rigorously revised by experts due to potential incongruences, such as the overlap of objectives and variables across the original and intended studies and ongoing dialect change.","Jeszenszky, Péter; Steiner, Carina; Leemann, Adrian",Front Artif Intell,30,32

As MIS-C combines clinical features of Kawasaki disease and Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), we aimed to compare the immunological profile of pediatric patients with these different conditions. We analyzed blood cytokine expression, and the T cell repertoire and phenotype in 36 MIS-C cases, which were compared to 16 KD, 58 TSS, and 42 COVID-19 cases. We observed an increase of serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, TNF-&#945;, IFNÎ³, CD25s, MCP1, IL-1RA) in MIS-C, TSS and KD, contrasting with low expression of HLA-DR in monocytes. We detected a specific expansion of activated T cells expressing the Vß21.3 T cell receptor ß chain variable region in both CD4 and CD8 subsets in 75% of MIS-C patients and not in any patient with TSS, KD, or acute COVID-19; this correlated with the cytokine storm detected. The T cell repertoire returned to baseline within weeks after MIS-C resolution. Vß21.3+ T cells from MIS-C patients expressed high levels of HLA-DR, CD38 and CX3CR1 but had weak responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides in vitro. Consistently, the T cell expansion was not associated with specific classical HLA alleles. Thus, our data suggested that MIS-C is characterized by a polyclonal Vß21.3 T cell expansion not directed against SARS-CoV-2 antigenic peptides, which is not seen in KD, TSS and acute COVID-19.","Moreews, Marion; Le Gouge, Kenz; Khaldi-Plassart, Samira; Pescarmona, Rémi; Mathieu, Anne-Laure; Malcus, Christophe; Djebali, Sophia; Bellomo, Alicia; Dauwalder, Olivier; Perret, Magali; Villard, Marine; Chopin, Emilie; Rouvet, Isabelle; Vandenesh, Francois; Dupieux, Céline; Pouyau, Robin; Teyssedre, Sonia; Guerder, Margaux; Louazon, Tiphaine; Moulin-Zinsch, Anne; Duperril, Marie; Patural, Hugues; Giovannini-Chami, Lisa; Portefaix, Aurélie; Kassai, Behrouz; Venet, Fabienne; Monneret, Guillaume; Lombard, Christine; Flodrops, Hugues; De Guillebon, Jean-Marie; Bajolle, Fanny; Launay, Valérie; Bastard, Paul; Zhang, Shen-Ying; Dubois, Valérie; Thaunat, Olivier; Richard, Jean-Christophe; Mezidi, Mehdi; Allatif, Omran; Saker, Kahina; Dreux, Marlène; Abel, Laurent; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Marvel, Jacqueline; Trouillet-Assant, Sophie; Klatzmann, David; Walzer, Thierry; Mariotti-Ferrandiz, Encarnita; Javouhey, Etienne; Belot, Alexandre",Sci. immunol,30,20

Median [IQR] days from hospital admission to referral was 4 [1-12] days. Most prevalent symptoms (n) were breathlessness (67), agitation (43), drowsiness (36), pain (23) and delirium (24). Fifty-eight patients were prescribed a subcutaneous infusion. Frequently used medicines (median-maximum dose/24h) were opioids (morphine, 10-30mg; fentanyl, 100-200mcg; alfentanil 500-1000 mcg) and midazolam (10-20mg).

In Argentina, and other South American countries, coca paste or “PACO” (cocaine and caffeine are its major components) is massively consumed with deleterious clinical consequences for the health and well-being of the general population. A scant number of studies have addressed the consequences of stimulant combination of cocaine and caffeine on the physiology of the somatosensory thalamocortical (ThCo) system. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to study ion conductances that have important implications regulating sleep–wake states 24-h after an acute or chronic binge-like administration of a cocaine and caffeine mixture following previously analyzed pasta base samples (“PACO”-like binge”) using mice. METHODS: We randomly injected (i.p.) male C57BL/6JFcen mice with a binge-like psychostimulants regimen during either 1 day (acute) or 1 day on/1 day off during 13 days for a total of 7 binges (chronic). Single-cell patch-clamp recordings of VB neurons were performed in thalamocortical slices 24 h after the last psychostimulant injection. We also recorded EEG/EMG from mice 24 h after being systemically treated with chronic administration of cocaine + caffeine versus saline, vehicle. RESULTS: Our results showed notorious changes in the intrinsic properties of the VB nucleus neurons that persist after 24-h of either acute or chronic binge administrations of combined cocaine and caffeine (“PACO”-like binge). Functional dysregulation of HCN (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated) and T-type VGC (voltage-gated calcium) channels was described 24-h after acute/chronic “PACO”-like administrations. Furthermore, intracellular basal [Ca(2+)] disturbances resulted a key factor that modulated the availability and the activation of T-type channels, altering T-type “window currents.” As a result, all these changes ultimately shaped the low-threshold spikes (LTS)-associated Ca(2+) transients, regulated the membrane excitability, and altered sleep-wake transitions. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that deleterious consequences of stimulants cocaine and caffeine combination on the thalamocortical physiology as a whole might be related to potential neurotoxic effects of soaring intracellular [Ca(2+)].","Rivero-Echeto, María Celeste; Perissinotti, Paula P.; González-Inchauspe, Carlota; Kargieman, Lucila; Bisagno, Verónica; Urbano, Francisco J.",Psychopharmacology (Berl),30,16

Four well-managed herds experiencing neonatal diarrhoea and suspected to be affected by NNPDS were included in a case-control set up. A total of 989 piglets were clinically examined on a daily basis. Samples from diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic piglets at the age of three to seven days were selected for extensive virological examination using specific real time polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs) and general virus detection methods. RESULTS: A total of 91.7% of the animals tested positive by reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) for porcine kobuvirus 1 (PKV-1) while 9% and 3% were found to be positive for rotavirus A and porcine teschovirus (PTV), respectively. The overall prevalence of porcine astrovirus (PAstV) was 75% with 69.8% of the PAstV positive pigs infected with PAstV type 3. No animals tested positive for rotavirus C, coronavirus (TGEV, PEDV and PRCV), sapovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, saffoldvirus, cosavirus, klassevirus or porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). Microarray analyses performed on a total of 18 animals were all negative, as were eight animals examined by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Using Next Generation de novo sequencing (de novo NGS) on pools of samples from case animals within all herds, PKV-1 was detected in four herds and rotavirus A, rotavirus C and PTV were detected in one herd each. CONCLUSIONS: Our detailed analyses of piglets from NNPDS-affected herds demonstrated that viruses did not pose a significant contribution to NNPDS.

Pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) disease is a leading risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and poor outcomes, and cardiac involvement is prevalent in COVID-19 patients both during the acute phase as well as in convalescence. The utility of traditional CV risk biomarkers in mild COVID-19 disease or across disease course is poorly understood. We sought to determine if a previously validated 27-protein predictor of CV outcomes served a purpose in COVID-19. Methods: The 27-protein test of residual CV (RCV) risk was applied without modification to n=860 plasma samples from hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals at disease presentation from three independent cohorts to predict COVID-19 severity and mortality. The same test was applied to an additional n=991 longitudinal samples to assess sensitivity to change in CV risk throughout the course of infection into convalescence. Results: In each independent cohort, RCV predictions were significantly related to maximal subsequent COVID-19 severity and to mortality. At the baseline blood draw, the mean protein-predicted likelihood of an event in subjects who died during the study period ranged from 88-99% while it ranged from 8-36% in subjects who were not admitted to hospital. Additionally, the test outperformed existing risk predictors based on commonly used laboratory chemistry values or presence of comorbidities. Application of the RCV test to sequential samples showed dramatic increases in risk during the first few days of infection followed by risk reduction in the survivors; a period of catastrophically high cardiovascular risk (above 50%) typically lasted 8-12 days and had not resolved to normal levels in most people within that timescale. Conclusions: The finding that a 27-protein candidate CV surrogate endpoint developed in multi-morbid patients prior to the pandemic is both prognostic and acutely sensitive to the adverse effects of COVID-19 suggests that this disease activates the same biologic risk-related mechanisms.

Our outbreak investigation included 623 multinational crewmembers onboard on April 20. Median age was 31 years; 84% were men. Each crewmember was isolated or quarantined in a single room inside the ship, and monitoring of health status was supported by a remote health monitoring system. Crewmembers with more severe illness were hospitalized. The investigation found that the outbreak started in late March and peaked in late April, resulting in 149 laboratory-confirmed and 107 probable cases of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Six case-patients were hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia, including 1 in severe condition and 2 who required oxygen administration, but no deaths occurred. Although the virus can spread rapidly on a cruise ship, we describe how prompt isolation and quarantine combined with a sensitive syndromic surveillance system can control a COVID-19 outbreak.","Maeda, Haruka; Sando, Eiichiro; Toizumi, Michiko; Arima, Yuzo; Shimada, Tomoe; Tanaka, Takeshi; Tashiro, Masato; Fujita, Ayumi; Yanagihara, Katsunori; Takayama, Hayato; Yasuda, Ikkoh; Kawachi, Nobuyuki; Kohayagawa, Yoshitaka; Hasegawa, Maiko; Motomura, Katsuaki; Fujita, Rie; Nakata, Katsumi; Yasuda, Jiro; Morita, Koichi; Kohno, Shigeru; Izumikawa, Koichi; Suzuki, Motoi; Morimoto, Konosuke",Emerg Infect Dis,30,1

International medical electives are a well-established part of curricula at most medical schools in high-income countries. They are highly valued by students and have proven educational benefits, though do come with challenges, such as lack of reciprocity. Low and middle-income countries frequently host students from high-income countries providing learning opportunities, yet also carry the burden of supervision and resource consumption, whilst their students get few elective opportunities. This study explores the value and feasibility of South-South Medical Elective Exchanges (SSMEE), which creates elective opportunities for African medical students in other African countries to create reciprocity within the elective system. METHOD: A qualitative evaluation of the South-South Medical Elective Exchanges was conducted using a case study approach. Four African medical schools, College of Medicine, Malawi; University of Rwanda, Rwanda; University of Witwatersrand, South Africa and Makerere University, Uganda participated in the pilot study in 2017/18. Each institution selected two students to participate in a four-week elective to another participating institute. Participating students completed a pre-elective questionnaire and a post-elective interview exploring expectations, learning outcomes, challenges and how they are applying this learning. Data was analysed thematically. RESULTS: Data presented is from six of the eight participating students. All students found the elective a valuable experience and learning was demonstrated in four key areas: clinical knowledge and skills; attitudes; personal and professional development and global perspectives. For some, it challenged their assumptions of what an elective is because valuable learning can be achieved whilst remaining in Africa. The main challenge found related to funding the elective. CONCLUSIONS: The SSMEE model is feasible and provides valuable learning for participating students and their peers/colleagues. Financing electives remains the biggest challenge. Since this pilot study, SSMEE has become part of a regional elective exchange network in Africa with an additional four institutions in three other countries. As such SSMEE has resulted in increased opportunities for African medical students and better educational outcomes that are likely to have a positive effect on healthcare systems in Africa.","Daniels, Katy; Thomson, Emma; Nawagi, Faith; Flinkenflögel, Maaike",BMC Med Educ,30,1

Population bottlenecks are frequent during the life cycle of viruses and can reduce viral populations transiently to very few individuals. Viruses have to confront several types of constraints that can be divided into basal, cell-dependent, and organism-dependent constraints. Viruses overcome them exploiting a number of molecular mechanisms, with an important contribution of population numbers and genome variation. The adaptive potential of viruses is reflected in modifications of cell tropism and host range, escape to components of the host immune response, and capacity to alternate among different host species, among other phenotypic changes. Despite a fitness cost of most mutations required to overcome a selective constraint, viruses can find evolutionary pathways that ensure their survival in equilibrium with their hosts.","Domingo, Esteban",Virus as Populations,30,16

The obligation to stay at home can cause psychological disorders for people. For this reason, physical activities at home are crucial to reduce the level of anxiety, protect against negative feelings, and strengthen the mental health. This study aims to investigate how COVID-19 affects the social life and the anxiety levels of people at home during the quarantine process within the framework of a solution-oriented approach. In this study, one of the qualitative research patterns ""phenomenology"" has been used to determine the opinions of the participants. The study group of the research consists of 14 people with moderate income who actively participate in anxiety-reducing activities of an International Coach Federation (ICF) consultancy center in Istanbul. The themes have been created in line with the answers obtained by the result of content analysis as ""questioning the process, understanding yourself, internal purification,"" and sub-themes of these determined themes have also been created. It has been concluded that during quarantine; excessively exposed to media, the state of uncertainty about the end of the pandemic, the thought of themselves or their loved ones catching the virus, and the application of social isolation increase the anxiety. However, the participants have stated that by the help of physical activities performed at home, sleep disorders have been eliminated, concentration deficiency in activities carried out from home improved, and anger and tension decreased.

However, FDG uptake outside lung parenchyma was poorly characterized in detail. We evaluated the extra-parenchymal lung involvement in asymptomatic cancer patients with COVID-19 pneumonia through (18)F-FDG PET-CT. METHODS: A total of 1079 oncologic (18)F-FDG PET-CT were performed between February 2 and May 18, 2020. Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was defined as characteristic ground-glass bilateral CT infiltrates and positive genetic/serologic tests. Nonmetastatic extra-parenchymal lung PET-CT findings were evaluated through qualitative (visual), quantitative (measurements on CT), and semiquantitative (maximum standardized uptake value: SUVmax on PET) interpretation. Clinical data, blood tests, and PET-CT results were compared between patients with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 23 (18)F-FDG PET-CT scans with pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of COVID-19 and available laboratory data were included: 14 positive (cases) and 9 negative (controls) for COVID-19 infection, representing a low prevalence of COVID-19 pneumonia (1.3%). Serum lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimers tended to be increased in COVID-19 cases. Extra-parenchymal lung findings were found in 42.9% of patients with COVID-19, most frequently as mediastinal and hilar nodes with (18)F-FDG uptake (35.7%), followed by incidental pulmonary embolism in two patients (14.3%). In the control group, extra-pulmonary findings were observed in a single patient (11.1%) with (18)F-FDG uptake located to mediastinal, hilar, and cervical nodes. Nasopharyngeal and hepatic SUVmax were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: In cancer patients with asymptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia, (18)F-FDG PET-CT findings are more frequently limited to thoracic structures, suggesting that an early and silent distant involvement is very rare. Pulmonary embolism is a frequent and potentially severe finding raising special concern. PET-CT can provide new pathogenic insights about this novel disease.","Wakfie-Corieh, Cristina Gamila; Blanes García, Alba María; Ferrando-Castagnetto, Federico; Valhondo-Rama, Raquel; Ortega Candil, Aida; Rodríguez Rey, Cristina; Cabrera Martín, María Nieves; García-Esquinas, Marta García; Couto Caro, Rosa María; Pedrera Canal, María; Carreras Delgado, José Luis",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,30,24

In this paper, corona discharge (CD) was explored as a safe and reliable method for mask reuse to alleviate the situation. CD can disinfect masks and simultaneously restore electrostatic charges to prevent filtration efficiency deterioration. Electric field, ions, and reactive species generated by CD cause DNA damage and protein denaturation to effectively disinfect N95 respirators. Log reduction of 2-3 against Escherichia coli can be easily reached within 7.5 min. Log reduction of up to 6 can be reached after three cycles of treatment with optimized parameters. CD disinfection is a broad spectrum with log reduction >1 against yeast and >2.5 against spores. N95 respirators can be recharged within 30 s of treatment and the charges can be retained at a higher level than brand-new masks for at least 5 days. The filtration efficiency of masks was maintained at â¼95% after 15 cycles of treatment.

The COVID-19 pandemic had posed particular challenges for nursing practice. There is currently only limited information available about nursing care in health care institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. AIM: Therefore the aim of this study was to describe the quality of nursing care during the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to the available structural circumstances (structure), the applied interventions (process) and the perceived stress of nursing staff (outcome). METHOD: A cross-sectional study using an electronic questionnaire was carried out in different health care institutions. The questionnaire includes general questions as well as questions on structure, process and outcome indicators. RESULTS: 2605 nurses participated in this online survey. The study showed that nurses were often provided with guidelines and trainings on protective measures. About two thirds of the nurses reported a sufficient availability of face masks, yet half of the participants wore them longer than eight hours. The study also showed that nurses often applied personal (e.g. use of face masks) and general protective measures (e.g. hand sanitation). Around two thirds of the nurses experienced moderate to high levels of stress. CONCLUSION: Health care institutions need to be equipped with sufficient and adequate protective materials in order to be prepared for a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics. Nurses who are working in times posing extraordinary challenges and stress need to be provided with psychosocial support programmes. These measures are indespensable for ensuring high quality nursing care even under extraordinary circumstances.","Bauer, Silvia; Eglseer, Doris; Hödl, Manuela",Procare,30,16

Legionnaire's disease can be differentiated from typical CAPs and from other atypical CAPs based on its characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement. The first clinically useful diagnostic weighted point score system for the clinical diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was developed by the Infectious Disease Division at Winthrop-University Hospital in the 1980s. It has proven to be diagnostically accurate and useful for more than two decades, but was time-consuming. Because Legionella spp. diagnostic tests are time-dependent and problematic, a need was perceived for a rapid, simple way to render a clinical, syndromic diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease pending Legionella test results. During the “herald wave” of the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic in the New York area, our hospital, like others, was inundated with patients who presented to the Emergency Department with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) for H1N1 testing/evaluation. Most patients with ILIs did not have swine influenza. Hospitalized patients with ILIs who tested positive with rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) were placed on influenza precautions and treated with oseltamivir. Unfortunately, approximately 30% of adult patients admitted with an ILI had negative RIDTs. Because the definitive laboratory diagnosis of H1N1 pneumonia by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR), testing was restricted by health departments, resulted in clinical and infection control dilemmas in determining which RIDT-negative patients did, in fact, have H1N1 pneumonia. OBJECTIVE: Accordingly, a diagnostic weighted point score system was developed for H1N1 pneumonia patients, based on RT-PCR positivity by the Infectious Disease Division at Winthrop-University Hospital. This diagnostic point score system for hospitalized adults with negative RIDTs was time-consuming. As the pandemic progressed, a simplified diagnostic swine influenza (H1N1) triad was developed for the rapid clinical diagnosis of probable H1N1 pneumonia, which also differentiated it from its mimics as well as from bacterial pneumonia, eg, Legionnaires' disease. During the “herald wave” of the H1N1 pandemic, we noticed an unexplained increase in Legionnaires' disease CAPs. Because clinical resources were stressed to the maximum during the pandemic, it was critically important to rapidly identify patients rapidly with Legionnaire's disease who did not require influenza precautions or oseltamivir, but who did require anti-Legionella antimicrobial therapy. METHODS: Based on the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's diagnostic weighted point score system for Legionnaires' disease (modified), key indicators were identified and became the basis for the diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad. The diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad was used to make a clinical diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease until the results of Legionella diagnostic tests were reported. The diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad diagnosed Legionnaires' disease in hospitalized adults with CAPs with extrapulmonary findings (atypical CAP) and relative bradycardia, accompanied by any three (ie, a triad) of the following: otherwise unexplained relative lymphopenia, early/mildly elevated serum transaminases (SGOT/SGPT), highly increased ferritin levels (≥2 × n), or hypophosphatemia. The diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad provides clinicians with a rapid way to clinically diagnose Legionnaires' disease, pending Legionella test results. RESULTS: The accuracy of the diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad was confirmed in our 9 cases of Legionnaires' disease by subsequent Legionella diagnostic testing. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad is particularly useful in situations where a rapid clinical syndromic diagnosis is needed, ie, during an H1N1 pandemic.","Cunha, Burke A.; Mickail, Nardeen; Syed, Uzma; Strollo, Stephanie; Laguerre, Marianne",Heart Lung,30,16

In this study, we assessed the use of telehealth among primary care and specialty clinics, by targeting healthcare administrators via multiple channels. METHODS: Using an online survey, we assessed the use of, barriers to, and reimbursement for telehealth. Respondents included clinic administrators (chief executive officers, vice presidents, directors, and senior-level managers). RESULTS: A total of 85 complete responses were recorded, 79% of which represented solo or group practices and 63% reported a daily patient census >50. The proportion of clinics that delivered ≥50% of their consults using telehealth increased from 16% in March to 42% in April, 35% in May, and 30% in June. Clinics identified problems with telehealth reimbursement; although 63% of clinics reported that ≥75% of their telehealth consults were reimbursed, only 51% indicated that ≥75% of their telehealth visits were reimbursed at par with in-person office visits. Sixty-five percent of clinics reported having basic or foundational telehealth services, whereas only 9% of clinics reported advanced telehealth maturity. Value-based care participating clinics were more likely to report advanced telehealth services (27%), compared with non-value-based care clinics (3%). CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the adaptability of clinics to quickly transition and adopt telehealth. Uncertainty about reimbursement and policy changes may make the shift temporal, however.","Adepoju, Omolola E.; Chae, Minji; Ayadi, M. Femi; Matuk-Villazon, Omar; Liaw, Winston",South Med J,30,30

In this work, we analyze the dispersion of cough-generated droplets in the wake of a walking person for different space sizes. The air flow is simulated by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, and the droplets are modeled as passive Lagrangian particles. Simulation results show that the cloud of droplets locates around and below the waist height of the manikin after 2 s from coughing, which indicates that kids walking behind an infectious patient are exposed to higher transmission risk than adults. More importantly, two distinct droplet dispersion modes occupying significantly different contamination regions are discovered. A slight change of space size is found being able to trigger the transition of dispersion modes even though the flow patterns are still similar. This shows the importance of accurately simulating the air flow in predicting the dispersion of viral droplets and implies the necessity to set different safe-distancing guidelines for different environments.","Li, Zhaobin; Wang, Hongping; Zhang, Xinlei; Wu, Ting; Yang, Xiaolei",Phys Fluids (1994),30,23

We performed a longitudinal analysis of multiple cohorts, using individual data, to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine against new and breakthrough cases. METHODS: We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) for 27 consecutive cohorts, each comprised of individuals vaccinated on specific days. VE against new COVID-19 cases was evaluated for five SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes: infection, symptomatic disease, hospitalisation, severe/critical disease and death. For breakthrough cases, rate reduction was evaluated for hospitalisation, severe/critical disease and death. Outcomes were evaluated at predetermined time-periods after vaccination, the last one dedicated to individuals who became SARS-CoV-2-positive 22–28 days after the second dose. FINDINGS: The highest VE estimates against new cases in ≥16 year old individuals, for all outcomes, were reached at the 15–21 day period after the second dose, ranging between 97.7% (95% CI: 95.9–98.7%) for deaths and 98.6% (95% CI: 97.8–99.1%) for severe/critical disease. VE estimates of the 14–20 day period after the first dose ranged between 54.3% (95% CI: 50.6–57.8%) for infection and 77.3% (95% CI: 71.2–82.1%) for severe/critical disease. VE rose more slowly among ≥80 year old individuals. Rate reductions of breakthrough complications were highest at the 22–28 day period after the second dose, ranging between 47.4% (95% CI: 4.3–71.2%) for death and 66.2% (95% CI: 44.2–79.6%) for severe/critical disease.

The most fearful aspect is the unavailability of any concrete guidelines and treatment or protective strategies for reducing mortality or morbidity caused by this virus. Repurposing of drugs, antivirals, convalescent plasma and neutralizing antibodies are being considered for treatment but are still questionable in lieu of the conflicting data, study design and induction of secondary infections. Stem cell therapy has seen substantial advancements over the past decade for the treatment of various diseases including pulmonary disorders with severe complications similar to COVID-19. Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have received particular attention as a potential therapeutic modality for SARS-CoV2 infection due to their ability to inhibit cytokine storm, a hallmark of severe COVID-19. MSCs secretion of trophic factors and extracellular vesicles mediated intercellular signaling are considered as principal contributing factors for tissue recovery. Although, recent preliminary studies have established the safety and efficacy of these cells without any severe secondary complications in the treatment of SARS-CoV2 infection, the rational use of MSCs on a large scale would still require additional relevant clinical investigations and validation of postulated mechanisms of these cells. This review presents the current clinical findings and update on the potential use of stem cell therapy and its secretome in combating the symptoms associated with COVID-19.","Mahajan, Aditi; Bhattacharyya, Shalmoli",Biomed J,30,26
