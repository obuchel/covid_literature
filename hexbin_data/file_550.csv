10949,Pervasive refusal syndrome: systematic review of case reports,2020-04-27,"Currently, there is a trend of increasing incidence in pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections (PNTM) together with a decrease in tuberculosis (TB) incidence, particularly in developed countries. The prevalence of PNTM in underdeveloped and developing countries remains unclear as there is still a lack of detection methods that could clearly diagnose PNTM applicable in these low-resource settings. Since non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are environmental pathogens, the vicinity favouring host-pathogen interactions is known as important predisposing factor for PNTM. The ongoing changes in world population, as well as socio-political and economic factors, are linked to the rise in the incidence of PNTM. Development is an important factor for the improvement of population well-being, but it has also been linked, in general, to detrimental environmental consequences, including the rise of emergent (usually neglected) infectious diseases, such as PNTM. The rise of neglected PNTM infections requires the expansion of the current efforts on the development of diagnostics, therapies and vaccines for mycobacterial diseases, which at present, are mainly focused on TB. This review discuss the current situation of PNTM and its predisposing factors, as well as the efforts and challenges for their control.","Chin, Kai Ling; Sarmiento, Maria E.; Alvarez-Cabrera, Nadine; Norazmi, Mohd Nor; Acosta, Armando",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222044/,550
14352,What distinguishes positive deviance (PD) health professionals from their peers and what impact does a PD intervention have on behaviour change: a cross-sectional study of infection control and prevention in three Israeli hospitals,2020-10-14,"BACKGROUND: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s (KSA) health sector is undergoing rapid reform in line with the National Transformation Program, as part of Saudi’s vision for the future, Vision 2030. From a nursing human resources for health (HRH) perspective, there are challenges of low nursing school capacity, high employment of expatriates, labor market fragmentation, shortage of nurses in rural areas, uneven quality, and gender challenges. CASE PRESENTATION: This case study summarizes Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) and Saudi Health Council’s (SHCs) evaluation of the current challenges facing the nursing profession in the KSA. We propose policy interventions to support the transformation of nursing into a profession that contributes to efficient, high-quality healthcare for every Saudi citizen. Key to the success of modernizing the Saudi workforce will be an improved pipeline of nurses that leads from middle and high school to nursing school; followed by a diverse career path that includes postgraduate education. To retain nurses in the profession, there are opportunities to make nursing practice more attractive and family friendly. Interventions include reducing shift length, redesigning the nursing team to add more allied health workers, and introducing locum tenens staffing to balance work-load. There are opportunities to modernize existing nurse postgraduate education, open new postgraduate programs in nursing, and create new positions and career paths for nurses such as telenursing, informatics, and quality. Rural pipelines should be created, with incentives and increased compensation packages for underserved areas. CONCLUSIONS: Critical to these proposed reforms is the collaboration of the MOH with partners across the healthcare system, particularly the private sector. Human resources planning should be sector-wide and nursing leadership should be strengthened at all levels.","Alluhidan, Mohammed; Tashkandi, Nabiha; Alblowi, Fahad; Omer, Tagwa; Alghaith, Taghred; Alghodaier, Hussah; Alazemi, Nahar; Tulenko, Kate; Herbst, Christopher H.; Hamza, Mariam M.; Alghamdi, Mohammed G.",Hum Resour Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7716289/,550

14742,Suicidal Behavior and Flood Effects in Bangladesh: A Two-Site Interview Study,2021-01-13,"BACKGROUND: Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) for large colorectal polyps is in most cases the preferred treatment to prevent progression to colorectal carcinoma. The most common complication after EMR is delayed bleeding, occurring in 7% overall and in approximately 10% of polyps ≥ 2 cm in the proximal colon. Previous research has suggested that prophylactic clipping of the mucosal defect after EMR may reduce the incidence of delayed bleeding in polyps with a high bleeding risk. METHODS: The CLIPPER trial is a multicenter, parallel-group, single blinded, randomized controlled superiority study. A total of 356 patients undergoing EMR for large (≥ 2 cm) non-pedunculated polyps in the proximal colon will be included and randomized to the clip group or the control group. Prophylactic clipping will be performed in the intervention group to close the resection defect after the EMR with a distance of < 1 cm between the clips. Primary outcome is delayed bleeding within 30 days after EMR. Secondary outcomes are recurrent or residual polyps and clip artifacts during surveillance colonoscopy after 6 months, as well as cost-effectiveness of prophylactic clipping and severity of delayed bleeding. DISCUSSION: The CLIPPER trial is a pragmatic study performed in the Netherlands and is powered to determine the real-time efficacy and cost-effectiveness of prophylactic clipping after EMR of proximal colon polyps ≥ 2 cm in the Netherlands. This study will also generate new data on the achievability of complete closure and the effects of clip placement on scar surveillance after EMR, in order to further promote the debate on the role of prophylactic clipping in everyday clinical practice.

15258,Beneficial effects of choir singing on cognition and well-being of older adults: Evidence from a cross-sectional study,2021-02-03,"PURPOSE: In organ transplantation, the need for immune modulation rather than immune suppression has been emphasized. In this study, we investigated whether combinatorial treatments of with thalidomide (TM) and dexamethasone (DX) might be new approaches to induce systemic immunomodulation on T cells and other immune cells that regulate the expression of co-inhibitory molecules. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Naïve splenic T cells from C57BL/6 mice were sort-purified and cultured in vitro for CD4(+) T cell proliferation and regulatory T cell (Treg) conversion in the presence of TM or/and DX. Expression of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1) in proliferated and converted T cells was quantified by flow cytometry. We also quantified in vivo expression of CTLA-4 and PD-1 on splenic CD4(+) T cells and other immune cells isolated from TM- or/and DX-treated mice. Mixed lymphocytes reactions (MLR) were performed to evaluate the capacity of immune cells in carrying out immune responses. RESULTS: CTLA-4 expressions in effector T cells in vivo and in Tregs in vivo/vitro significantly increased upon TM/DX combinatorial treatment. Corresponding to increased CTLA-4 expression in T cells, the expression of ligand molecules for CTLA-4 significantly increased in splenic dendritic cells in TM/DX-treated groups. In addition, MLR results demonstrated that splenocytes isolated from TM/DX-treated mice significantly suppressed the proliferation of T cells isolated from other strains. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, we suggest that TM/DX combinatorial treatments might be efficient immunomodulatory methods for regulating T cell immunity.","Kim, Eun Jee; Kim, Joon Ye; Choi, Hoon Young; Lee, Hyojung; Lee, Juhan; Kim, Myoung Soo; Kim, Yu Seun; Huh, Kyu Ha; Kim, Beom Seok",Yonsei Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7859687/,550
17526,The association between deficiency of nutrient intake and resting metabolic rate in overweight and obese women: a cross-sectional study,2021-05-12,"Background To say that the transition from undergraduate medical education (UME) to graduate medical education (GME) is under scrutiny would be an understatement. Findings from a panel discussion at the 2018 Association of American Medical Colleges Annual meeting entitled, “Pass-Fail in Medical School and the Residency Application Process and Graduate Medical Education Transition” addressed what and when information should be shared with residency programs, and how and when that information should be shared. Materials and Methods Over 250 participants representing UME and GME (e.g. leadership, faculty, medical students) completed worksheets addressing these questions. During report-back times, verbal comments were transcribed in real time, and written comments on worksheets were later transcribed. All comments were anonymous. Thematic analysis was conducted manually by the research team to analyze the worksheet responses and report back comments. Results Themes based on suggestions of what information should be shared included the following: 1) developmental/assessment benchmarks such as demonstrating the ability/competencies to do clinical work; 2) performance on examinations; 3) grades and class ranking; 4) 360 evaluations; 5) narrative evaluations; 6) failures/remediation/gaps in training; 7) professionalism lapses; 8) characteristics of students such as resiliency/reliability; and 9) service/leadership/participation. In terms of how this information should be shared, the participants suggested enhancements to the current process of transmitting documents rather than alternative methods (e.g., video, telephonic, face-to-face discussions) and information sharing at both the time of the match and again near/at graduation to include information about post-match rotations. Discussion Considerations to address concerns with the transition from medical school to residency include further enhancements to the Medical Student Performance Evaluation, viewing departmental letters as ones of evaluation and not recommendation, a more meaningful educational handoff, and limits on the number of residency applications allowed for each student. The current medical education environment is ready for meaningful change in the UME to GME transition.","Beck Dallaghan, Gary L; Alexandraki, Irene; Christner, Jennifer; Keeley, Meg; Khandelwal, Sorabh; Steiner, Beat; Hemmer, Paul A",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8121123/,550

However, feasibility and factors impacting FTCA implementation remain poorly explored both locally and internationally. We describe the specific intraoperative and postoperative protocols for our FTCA program, assess protocol compliance and identify reasons for FTCA failure. RESULTS: We tested the program in 16 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. There was 100% compliance with the FTCA protocols. Four (25%) patients successfully completed the FTCA protocol (extubated < 4 h postoperatively and discharged from the intensive care unit on the same operative day).","Lloyd-Donald, Patryck; Lee, Wen-Shen; Hooper, James W.; Lee, Dong Kyu; Moore, Alice; Chandra, Nikhil; McCall, Peter; Seevanayagam, Siven; Matalanis, George; Warrillow, Stephen; Weinberg, Laurence",BMC Res Notes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8140586/,550
18257,Evaluating adults’ health-related values and preferences about unprocessed red meat and processed meat consumption: protocol for a cross-sectional mixed-methods study,2021-05-13,"The length of waiting time has become an important indicator of the efficiency of medical services and the quality of medical care. Lengthy waiting times for patients will inevitably affect their mood and reduce satisfaction. For patients who are in urgent need of hospitalization, delayed admission often leads to exacerbation of the patient's condition and may threaten the patient's life. We gathered patients' information about outpatient visits and hospital admissions in the Nephrology Department of a large tertiary hospital in western China from January 1st, 2014, to December 31st, 2016, and we used big data-enabled analysis methods, including univariate analysis and multivariate linear regression models, to explore the factors affecting waiting time. We found that gender (P=0.048), the day of issuing the admission card (Saturday, P=0.028), the applied period for admission (P < 0.001), and the registration interval (P < 0.001) were positive influencing factors of patients' waiting time. Disease type (after kidney transplantation, P < 0.001), number of diagnoses (P=0.037), and the day of issuing the admission card (Sunday, P=0.001) were negative factors. A linear regression model built using these data performed well in the identification of factors affecting the waiting time of patients in the Nephrology Department. These results can be extended to other departments and could be valuable for improving patient satisfaction and hospital service quality by identifying the factors affecting waiting time.","Li, Jialing; Zhu, Guiju; Luo, Li; Shen, Wenwu",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8178001/,550
18363,Effectiveness of a Program Based on Telehealth in Nutritional Knowledge and Body Mass Index in Peruvian University Teachers,2021-06-10,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that poses significant threats to global public health. Macrophages and dendritic cells are both key sentinel cells in the host immune response and play critical roles in the pathogenesis of flavivirus infections. Recent studies showed that ZIKV could productively infect monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs), but the role of macrophages in ZIKV infection remains incompletely understood. In this study, we first compared ZIKV infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and moDCs derived from the same donors. We demonstrated that while both MDMs and moDCs were susceptible to epidemic (Puerto Rico) and pre-epidemic (Uganda) strains of ZIKV, virus replication was largely restricted in MDMs but not in moDCs. ZIKV induced significant apoptosis in moDCs but not MDMs. The restricted virus replication in MDMs was not due to inefficient virus entry but was related to post-entry events in the viral replication cycle. In stark contrast with moDCs, ZIKV failed to inhibit STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation in MDMs. This resulted in the lack of efficient antagonism of the host type I interferon-mediated antiviral responses. Importantly, depletion of STAT2 but not STAT1 in MDMs significantly rescued the replication of ZIKV and the prototype flavivirus yellow fever virus. Overall, our findings revealed a differential interplay between macrophages and dendritic cells with ZIKV. While dendritic cells may be exploited by ZIKV to facilitate virus replication, macrophages restricted ZIKV infection.","Yang, Dong; Chu, Hin; Lu, Gang; Shuai, Huiping; Wang, Yixin; Hou, Yuxin; Zhang, Xi; Huang, Xiner; Hu, Bingjie; Chai, Yue; Yuen, Terrence Tsz-Tai; Zhao, Xiaoyu; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Ye, Ziwei; Li, Cun; Chik, Kenn Ka-Heng; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Zhou, Jie; Yuan, Shuofeng; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8205058/,550
18528,A Digital Platform for Facilitating Personalized Dementia Care in Nursing Homes: Formative Evaluation Study,2021-05-28,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to investigate the clinical effect of radiotherapy combined with capecitabine in rectal cancer patients after neoadjuvant therapy. METHODS: 80 rectal cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy in our hospital from February 2016 to February 2018 were selected as the study subjects and divided into the control group (n = 40) and experimental group (n = 40) according to the order of admission. Among them, the control group was treated with radiotherapy, while the experimental group was treated with radiotherapy combined with capecitabine. The therapeutic efficacy, CEA levels, the incidence and recurrence rate of adverse reactions, as well as the progression-free survival and survival rate after 2-year treatment were analyzed in the two groups. RESULTS: The effective rate of treatment in the experimental group of 87.5% (35/40) was significantly higher than 50% (20/40) in the control group, with statistical significance (X(2) = 13.09, P < 0.001). After treatment, the CEA levels in the two groups both decreased significantly, and the CEA level in the experimental group of 3.75 ± 1.76 ng/ml was significantly lower than 7.35 ± 2.11 ng/ml in the control group, with statistical significance (T = 8.29, P < 0.001). The incidence and the recurrence rate of adverse reactions of 5% (2/40) and 10% (4/40), respectively, in the experimental group were significantly lower than those of 40% (16/40) and 30% (12/40) in the control group, with statistical significance (X(2) = 14.05, 5.00, P < 0.001, 0.05). After the 2-year follow-up, it was found that the progression-free survival of 21.53 ± 6.23 months in the experimental group was significantly longer than that of 18.18 ± 5.41 months in the control group, with statistical significance (T = 2.57, P < 0.05), and the 2-year survival rate of 97.5% (39/40) in the experimental group was significantly higher than 80% (32/40) in the control group, with statistical significance (T = 6.13, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy combined with capecitabine in rectal cancer patients after neoadjuvant therapy can improve the therapeutic efficacy with fewer adverse reactions and longer patients' survival, which is worthy of popularization and application after neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer.","Zhang, Qibo; Teng, Haibin",J Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8203376/,550
21343,Exploring determinants of community pharmacist-led influenza vaccination in a Middle Eastern country: a national web-based cross-sectional study,2021-09-20,"Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes called meninges and fluid adjacent the brain and spinal cord. The inflammatory progression expands all through subarachnoid space of the brain and spinal cord and occupies the ventricles. The pathogens like bacteria, fungi, viruses, or parasites are main sources of infection causing meningitis. Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening health problem that which needs instantaneous apprehension and treatment. Nesseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus flu are major widespread factors causing bacterial meningitis. The conventional drug delivery approaches encounter difficulty in crossing this blood-brain barrier (BBB) and therefore are insufficient to elicit the desired pharmacological effect as required for treatment of meningitis. Therefore, application of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems has become imperative for successful dealing with this deadly disease. The nanoparticles have ability to across BBB via four important transport mechanisms, i.e., paracellular transport, transcellular (transcytosis), endocytosis (adsorptive transcytosis), and receptor-mediated transcytosis. In this review, we reminisce distinctive symptoms of meningitis, and provide an overview of various types of bacterial meningitis, with a focus on its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and pathophysiology. This review describes conventional therapeutic approaches for treatment of meningitis and the problems encountered by them while transmitting across tight junctions of BBB. The nanotechnology approaches like functionalized polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carrier, nanoemulsion, liposomes, transferosomes, and carbon nanotubes which have been recently evaluated for treatment or detection of bacterial meningitis have been focused. This review has also briefly summarized the recent patents and clinical status of therapeutic modalities for meningitis.","Sharma, Neelam; Zahoor, Ishrat; Sachdeva, Monika; Subramaniyan, Vetriselvan; Fuloria, Shivkanya; Fuloria, Neeraj Kumar; Naved, Tanveer; Bhatia, Saurabh; Al-Harrasi, Ahmed; Aleya, Lotfi; Bungau, Simona; Behl, Tapan; Singh, Sukhbir",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8452126/,550

Surgery is not recommended for the majority of PMLBP consulting in secondary care settings. SETTING: Secondary care sector in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 24 orthopaedic team clinicians from 17 different hospitals in the UK and Ireland. Interviews explored clinicians’ perceptions of the challenges in consultations where surgery is not indicated. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Two meta-themes, Difficulties and Enablers, each consisting of several subthemes were identified. Difficulties included challenges around the choice of appropriate terminology and labels for PMLBP, managing patients’ expectations, working with mentally vulnerable patients and explaining imaging findings. Enablers included early management of expectations, use of routine imaging, triaging, access to direct referral elsewhere, including other non-surgical practitioners in the team, training to improve communication skills and understanding of psychological issues. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight clinicians’ perceived need for concordance in messages delivered across the care pathway and training of orthopaedic clinicians to deliver effective reassurance and address patients’ needs in circumstances where surgery is not indicated.","Braeuninger-Weimer, Kathrin Louise; Anjarwalla, Naffis; McGregor, Alison H; Roberts, Lisa; Sell, Philip; Pincus, Tamar",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8449963/,550

41245,Health-Related Quality of Life and Associated Factors Among Adult HIV Mono-Infected and TB/HIV Co-Infected Patients in Public Health Facilities in Northeast Ethiopia: A Comparative Cross-Sectional Study,2020-10-12,"One of the defining features of China’s economy over the two decades between 1995 and 2015 was the persistent rise of wages for workers and professionals in nearly every segment of the economy—with wage rates for labor-intensive jobs in manufacturing, construction, and the informal service sector rising the fastest. Recently, however, the economic environment in China has begun to change, including changes in both employment and wages. We identify recent employment/wage trends throughout China’s economy and postulate the sources of these trends as well as possible future consequences if they continue. We use official, nationally aggregated data to examine employment and wages in multiple sectors and industries. Our findings indicate that China may have entered a new phase of economic development in the mid-2010s. According to the data, in recent years, wage growth has begun to polarize: Rising for professionals employed in formal skill-intensive industries; and falling for workers in the informal labor-intensive service sector. We attribute this increase in skill-intensive wages to an increase in demand for skill-intensive employment, due to the emergence of a large middle class in China, for whom the demand for high technology, finance, banking, health, and higher education industries is increasing while, at least in the recent short term, the supply of experienced, high-skilled professionals has not kept up. The employment/wage trend in the informal (low-wage) service sector, however, is following a different pattern. While there is a rising demand for services in China’s economy, the growth, due to a number of factors (e.g., large shares of GDP targeted by policymakers to investment; high rates of savings by consumers), is relatively slow. In contrast, due to a number of economic forces, including globalization and automation, the supply of labor into the service sector of the informal economy is being fueled by the flow of labor out of manufacturing and construction (two industries that that have experienced employment declines since 2013). These supply and demand trends, in turn, are leading to the fall in the growth rate of wages in the informal service sector. We conclude by discussing the possible longer-term consequences of these emerging polarization trends based on an examination of recent experience with wage polarization occurring in both middle- and high-income countries, as well as its consequences. We also present policy recommendations for greater investment in education and human capital, as well as for the development of a more comprehensive set of social safety nets for different segments of China’s population.","Rozelle, Scott; Xia, Yiran; Friesen, Dimitris; Vanderjack, Bronson; Cohen, Nourya",Comp Econ Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7575858/,550

53334,190 Determinants of Psychological Well-Being in Healthcare Workers During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Multinational Cross-Sectional Study,2021-05-04,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is here to last, and services must adapt to enable elective surgery to continue. Surgery involves high-risk aerosol generating procedures, potentially harmful to staff and patients. The current NICE guidance is for the patient to self-isolate for 72 hours prior to surgery. A question persists: Is 72-hour isolation the way forward in elective general surgery? METHOD: In a DGH centre, using an anonymous questionnaire, we prospectively collected data on isolation for 36 elective general surgery patients during the 72h isolation period. The data was analysed to assess the concordance with isolation as well as patient's satisfaction with the process. RESULTS: 75% of patients were concordant with 72 hours of isolation pre-operatively. This was an increase from 35% when compared to patients questioned during the 14 day isolation period. The main factors contributing to isolation breech were visitors to the house and the mode of transport used to attend hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The protocol is now for a COVID swab 72 hours pre-operatively followed by isolation until the operation. Our results show that still significant breaches in isolation remain and patients welfare is adversely affected during that period. Further research and consideration is needed to optimise the COVID isolation protocol.","James, S; Lafaurie, G; Hafeez, R",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135643/,550

54743,Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on health-care professionals in India – A multicentric cross-sectional study,2020-12-31,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is continually worsening. Clinical treatment for COVID‐19 remains primarily supportive with no specific medicines or regimens. Here, the development of multifunctional alveolar macrophage (AM)‐like nanoparticles (NPs) with photothermal inactivation capability for COVID‐19 treatment is reported. The NPs, made by wrapping polymeric cores with AM membranes, display the same surface receptors as AMs, including the coronavirus receptor and multiple cytokine receptors. By acting as AM decoys, the NPs block coronavirus from host cell entry and absorb various proinflammatory cytokines, thus achieving combined antiviral and anti‐inflammatory treatment. To enhance the antiviral efficiency, an efficient photothermal material based on aggregation‐induced emission luminogens is doped into the NPs for virus photothermal disruption under near‐infrared (NIR) irradiation. In a surrogate mouse model of COVID‐19 caused by murine coronavirus, treatment with multifunctional AM‐like NPs with NIR irradiation decreases virus burden and cytokine levels, reduces lung damage and inflammation, and confers a significant survival advantage to the infected mice. Crucially, this therapeutic strategy may be clinically applied for the treatment of COVID‐19 at early stage through atomization inhalation of the NPs followed by NIR irradiation of the respiratory tract, thus alleviating infection progression and reducing transmission risk.","Li, Bin; Wang, Wei; Song, Weifeng; Zhao, Zheng; Tan, Qingqin; Zhao, Zhaoyan; Tang, Lantian; Zhu, Tianchuan; Yin, Jialing; Bai, Jun; Dong, Xin; Tan, Siyi; Hu, Qunying; Tang, Ben Zhong; Huang, Xi",Adv Sci (Weinh),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8209923/,550

In this study, six test logs (Quercus serrata, diameter of 38–48 mm, length of 110–118 mm) were used, of which some were dried, some had shiitake mycelia grown on them, and some had mold generated on them. Liquid water was supplied to the test logs by placing the longitudinal direction of the test logs along the line of gravity and immersing the bottom of the test logs in water. Water uptake mass of the test logs was measured for 20 h. The effective diffusion coefficient, D(eff), was calculated from the change in time of the water uptake mass using Fick's diffusion law. The D(eff) of test logs in which shiitake mycelium grew were 1.5–3.4 × 10(–8) m(2)/s, and the values were 2.4–4.7 times higher than that for the dried log. On the other hand, the D(eff) of the moldy logs were 6.7–9.7 × 10(–10) m(2)/s, which was 0.058–0.081 times that of dry test logs. Based on observation of water penetration into logs by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an optical microscope, it is believed that the driving force behind liquid water rising in the longitudinal direction in the test log is the capillary force acting on a three-phase interface consisting of the inner wall surface of the vessel, liquid water and air.

It is produced by a number of host cells and is known to shed and release cell-bound cytokines, particularly members of the TNF family. No investigations into the regulation of this enzyme by autoantibodies have been reported. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies, purified from IgG fractions of patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome, are capable to regulate TACE expression and activation in human salivary gland epithelial cells (SGEC). We also evaluated the potential physiological and therapeutic consequences of TNF-alpha blocking by the biological agent adalimumab, the first fully human (100% human peptide sequences) therapeutic anti-TNF-alpha antibody, on post-translational regulation of TACE. Taken together, our results show a dose-dependent increase in TACE expression in anti-Ro/SSA Abs-treated SGEC, followed by internalization, pro-domain shedding and activation of TACE protein. Adalimumab treatment brought TACE expression to levels than those observed in untreated SGEC. These findings, showing the presence of autoantibodies-dependent mechanisms by which TACE levels are regulated in human SGECs, may have implications in the context of current investigations on the pathological role of autoantibodies.","Lisi, Sabrina; Sisto, Margherita",Immunology and cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1038/icb.2009.97; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19949420/,550

62876,"E-health in China: challenges, initial directions, and experience.",2010,"BACKGROUND Current understanding of the carbon cycle in methanogenic environments involves trophic interactions such as interspecies H2 transfer between organotrophs and methanogens. However, many metabolic processes are thermodynamically sensitive to H2 accumulation and can be inhibited by H2 produced from co-occurring metabolisms. Strategies for driving thermodynamically competing metabolisms in methanogenic environments remain unexplored. RESULTS To uncover how anaerobes combat this H2 conflict in situ, we employ metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to revisit a model ecosystem that has inspired many foundational discoveries in anaerobic ecology-methanogenic bioreactors. Through analysis of 17 anaerobic digesters, we recovered 1343 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes and corresponding gene expression profiles for uncultured lineages spanning 66 phyla and reconstructed their metabolic capacities. We discovered that diverse uncultured populations can drive H2-sensitive metabolisms through (i) metabolic coupling with concurrent H2-tolerant catabolism, (ii) forgoing H2 generation in favor of interspecies transfer of formate and electrons (cytochrome- and pili-mediated) to avoid thermodynamic conflict, and (iii) integration of low-concentration O2 metabolism as an ancillary thermodynamics-enhancing electron sink. Archaeal populations support these processes through unique methanogenic metabolisms-highly favorable H2 oxidation driven by methyl-reducing methanogenesis and tripartite uptake of formate, electrons, and acetate. CONCLUSION Integration of omics and eco-thermodynamics revealed overlooked behavior and interactions of uncultured organisms, including coupling favorable and unfavorable metabolisms, shifting from H2 to formate transfer, respiring low-concentration O2, performing direct interspecies electron transfer, and interacting with high H2-affinity methanogenesis. These findings shed light on how microorganisms overcome a critical obstacle in methanogenic carbon cycles we had hitherto disregarded and provide foundational insight into anaerobic microbial ecology.

64950,Optimizing the Use Of Teleneurology During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-04-24,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Flow diverters are an exciting new class of endovascular devices that treat aneurysms by curative reconstruction of the parent artery. The Pipeline embolization device (PED) is the first FDA-approved intracranial flow diverting device available in the USA. This paper presents periprocedural results with the device in a series of 35 consecutive cases. METHODS All patients who underwent PED treatment of an intracranial aneurysm at our institution following FDA approval of the device in April 2011 were included in the series. Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, procedural details and technical and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Thirty-four patients (age range 23-78 years, mean 56.4 years) with 41 unruptured aneurysms (37 anterior circulation, four posterior circulation, mean size 11.4 mm, 20/21 large or giant) were treated with the PED in 35 cases (one patient had bilateral aneurysms treated on 2 separate occasions). Thirty-four of 35 cases (97%) were successfully completed. A total of 64 PEDs were implanted, with a mean number of 1.2 PEDs implanted per anterior circulation cases and 6.5 per posterior circulation cases. A single PED was implanted in 73% of cases. Immediate flow disruption occurred in 97% of the cases. The overall rate of major stroke or mortality was 3% (1/35 patients). Minor stroke, cranial nerve palsy, transient neurological deficit and groin complication occurred in one patient each (3% each, 12% total). CONCLUSION Treatment of cerebral aneurysms with the PED carries an acceptable risk profile when a rigorous and uniform technique is used. Although the long-term results will need to be analyzed, the immediate procedural outcomes in the study series using this technique appear quite promising.","Colby, Geoffrey P; Lin, Li-Mei; Gomez, Juan F; Paul, Alexandra R; Huang, Judy; Tamargo, Rafael J; Coon, Alexander L",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2012-010299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22459178/,550

Cardiac dysfunction is commonly seen in these patients, often presenting as clinical heart failure. Accordingly, we aim to provide a comprehensive review on COVID-19 myocarditis and its long-term heart failure sequelae. RECENT FINDINGS Several suspected cases of COVID-19 myocarditis have been reported. It is often not clear if the acute myocardial dysfunction is caused by myocarditis or secondary to generalized inflammatory state of cytokine release or microvascular thrombotic angiopathy. Ischemia may also need to be ruled out. Regardless, myocardial dysfunction in these patients is associated with poor overall prognosis. Laboratory testing, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and even endomyocardial biopsy may be needed for timely diagnosis. Several treatment strategies have been described, including both supportive and targeted therapies. SUMMARY COVID-19 can cause a spectrum of ventricular dysfunction ranging from mild disease to fulminant myocarditis with hemodynamic instability. Future research is needed to understand the true prevalence of COVID-19 myocarditis, as well as to better define various diagnostic protocols and treatment strategies.","Liu, Jing; Deswal, Anita; Khalid, Umair",Current opinion in cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/hco.0000000000000832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394709/,550

In the shared therapeutic decision-making process, the MS expert neurologist should also balance the risks of specific infections under each particular treatment and be familiar with new mitigation strategies. AREAS COVERED In this review, the authors provide an up-to-date review of the infection risk associated with MS treatments with a specific focus on risk mitigating strategies. The search was conducted using Pubmed® database (2000 - present) to identify publications that reported infection rates and infection complications for each treatment (interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, cladribine, natalizumab, alemtuzumab, rituximab, and ocrelizumab). EXPERT OPINION Since the emergence of the first natalizumab-related PML case, the arrival of new MS therapies has come hand in hand with new infectious complications. MS-specialist neurologist has to face new challenges regarding the management of immunosuppression-related infectious complications. The implementation of patient-centered management focus on preventive and mitigating strategies with a multidisciplinary approach should be seen in the future as a marker of excellence of MS management.","Otero-Romero, Susana; Sánchez-Montalvá, Adrián; Vidal-Jordana, Angela",Expert review of clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1080/1744666x.2021.1886924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33543657/,550

Objective To determine whether tocilizumab (TCZ) improves outcomes of patients hospitalized with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Design, Setting, and Particpants This cohort-embedded, investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, bayesian randomized clinical trial investigating patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe pneumonia requiring at least 3 L/min of oxygen but without ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit was conducted between March 31, 2020, to April 18, 2020, with follow-up through 28 days. Patients were recruited from 9 university hospitals in France. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis with no correction for multiplicity for secondary outcomes. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to receive TCZ, 8 mg/kg, intravenously plus usual care on day 1 and on day 3 if clinically indicated (TCZ group) or to receive usual care alone (UC group). Usual care included antibiotic agents, antiviral agents, corticosteroids, vasopressor support, and anticoagulants. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes were scores higher than 5 on the World Health Organization 10-point Clinical Progression Scale (WHO-CPS) on day 4 and survival without need of ventilation (including noninvasive ventilation) at day 14. Secondary outcomes were clinical status assessed with the WHO-CPS scores at day 7 and day 14, overall survival, time to discharge, time to oxygen supply independency, biological factors such as C-reactive protein level, and adverse events. Results Of 131 patients, 64 patients were randomly assigned to the TCZ group and 67 to UC group; 1 patient in the TCZ group withdrew consent and was not included in the analysis. Of the 130 patients, 42 were women (32%), and median (interquartile range) age was 64 (57.1-74.3) years. In the TCZ group, 12 patients had a WHO-CPS score greater than 5 at day 4 vs 19 in the UC group (median posterior absolute risk difference [ARD] -9.0%; 90% credible interval [CrI], -21.0 to 3.1), with a posterior probability of negative ARD of 89.0% not achieving the 95% predefined efficacy threshold. At day 14, 12% (95% CI -28% to 4%) fewer patients needed noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation (MV) or died in the TCZ group than in the UC group (24% vs 36%, median posterior hazard ratio [HR] 0.58; 90% CrI, 0.33-1.00), with a posterior probability of HR less than 1 of 95.0%, achieving the predefined efficacy threshold. The HR for MV or death was 0.58 (90% CrI, 0.30 to 1.09). At day 28, 7 patients had died in the TCZ group and 8 in the UC group (adjusted HR, 0.92; 95% CI 0.33-2.53). Serious adverse events occurred in 20 (32%) patients in the TCZ group and 29 (43%) in the UC group (P = .21). Conclusions and Relevance In this randomized clinical trial of patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia requiring oxygen support but not admitted to the intensive care unit, TCZ did not reduce WHO-CPS scores lower than 5 at day 4 but might have reduced the risk of NIV, MV, or death by day 14. No difference on day 28 mortality was found. Further studies are necessary for confirming these preliminary results.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, live in-person instruction was not feasible owing to social distancing protocols, so a virtual wet lab (VWL) was proposed and implemented. The purpose of this article is to describe our experience with a VWL as a Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) skills-transfer course. This is the first time that a VWL environment has been described for the instruction of ophthalmic surgery. METHODS Thirteen participant surgeons took part in VWLs designed for DMEK skills transfer in September and October 2020. A smartphone camera adapter and a video conference software platform were the unique media for the VWL. After a didactic session, participants were divided into breakout rooms where their surgical scope view was broadcast live, allowing instructors to virtually proctor their participants in real time. Participants were surveyed to assess their satisfaction with the course. RESULTS All (100%) participants successfully injected and unfolded their DMEK grafts. Ten of the 13 participants completed the survey. Respondents rated the experience highly favorably. CONCLUSIONS With the use of readily available technology, VWLs can be successfully implemented in lieu of in-person skills-transfer courses. Further development catering to the needs of the participant might allow VWLs to serve as a viable option of surgical education, currently limited by geographical and social distancing boundaries.","Cervantes, Lorenzo J; Tallo, Christian A; Lopes, Caithlin A; Hellier, Erik A; Chu, David S",Cornea,https://doi.org/10.1097/ico.0000000000002763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173369/,550

In the United States, COVID-19 disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, with an observed two-fold higher rate for hospitalization and greater than two-fold higher rate for death as compared to White Americans. The disparity seen with COVID-19 is consistent with patterns of disparities observed for cancer; it is well-documented that 5-year survival rates for multiple cancers are lower in African Americans compared to White Americans. Root cause contributions for the disparity overlap between COVID-19 and cancer. While cancer is a genetic disease that is influenced by tissue microenvironment, COVID-19 is an infectious disease that is enabled by cellular expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. However, socioeconomic disadvantages, level of education, lifestyle factors and health co-morbidities, and limited access to medical care appear to fuel underlying risk for both cancer and COVID-19 disparities. In addition to African Americans demonstrating higher risk of acquiring and dying from either disease, they are under-represented in clinical trials involving cancer or COVID-19. Long-term disparities are present with survivorship from cancer and may be likely with survivorship from COVID-19; both have revealed untoward effects on post-diagnosis economic viability for African Americans. Collaborative strategies that include community engagement, diverse participation in cancer and COVID-19 clinical trials, providing insurance for affected persons who lost employment due to either disease, and supporting safety-net and public hospitals for healthcare access will be critical to stem these disparities.","Newman, Lisa; Winn, Robert A; Carethers, John M",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-20-3421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33051304/,550

Although there are many animal-specific adenoviruses and occasionally they have been noted to infect man, rarely have they been studied as potential zoonotic pathogens. In this study, the authors hypothesized that the hemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV), an avian adenovirus that causes illness among turkeys, might infect humans. Using an enzyme immunosorbent assay, the authors compared sera from 95 turkey-exposed individuals with sera from 82 nonexposed controls for serologic evidence of infection with HEV. Multivariate modeling revealed no statistical difference in elevated antibody titers against HEV between the two groups.

For the investigation we employed conventional and temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry in combination with high resolving power dielectric spectroscopy techniques, broadband dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (BDS) and thermally stimulated depolarization currents (TSDC). Under ambient conditions short OEGMA (475 g mol-1, ∼4 nm in length) exhibits a remarkable low glass transition temperature, Tg, of -91 °C, crystallization temperature Tc = -24 °C and a significant crystalline fraction, CF, of ∼30%. When doubling the number of monomers (OEGMA-long, 950 g mol-1, chain length ∼8 nm) the Tg increases by about 20 K and CF increases to ∼53%, whereas, the Tc migrates to a room-like temperature of 19 °C. Upon formation of comb-like POEGMA structures the grafted OEGMA short chains, strikingly, are not able to crystallize, while in POEGMA-long the crystallization behaviour changes significantly as compared to OEGMA. Our results indicate that in the comb-like architecture the chain diffusion of the amorphous fractions is also strongly affected. The semicrystalline systems exhibit significant melt memory effects, this being stronger in the comb-like architecture. It is shown that these effects are related to the inter- and intra-chain interactions of the crystallizable chains. The dielectric techniques allowed the molecular dynamics mapping of these new systems from the linear oligomers to POEGMAs for the first time. BDS and TSDC detected various dynamics processes, in particular, the local polymer dynamics (γ process) to be sensitive to the Tg, local dynamics triggered in the hydrophilic chain segments by water traces (β), as well as the segmental dynamics (α) related to glass transition. Interestingly, both the short and long linear OEGMAs exhibit an additional relaxation process that resembles the Normal-Mode process appearing in polyethers. In the corresponding POEGMAs this process could not be resolved, this being an effect of the one-side grafted chain on the comb backbone. The revealed variations in molecular mobility and crystallization behavior suggest the potentially manipulable diffusion of small molecules throughout the polymer volume, via both the molecular architecture as well as the thermal treatment. This ability is extremely useful for these novel materials, envisaging their future applications in biomedicine (drug encapsulation).","Vassiliadou, Olga; Chrysostomou, Varvara; Pispas, Stergios; Klonos, Panagiotis A; Kyritsis, Apostolos",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0sm01666g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305780/,550

79798,Letter to the Editor: Impact of enhanced personal protective equipment on the physical and mental well-being of healthcare workers during COVID-19.,2020-12-30,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) appeared in 2019 and is the causative agent of the new pandemic viral disease COVID-19. The outbreak of COVID-19 infection is affecting the entire world, thus many researchers and scientists are desperately looking for suitable vaccines and treatment options. Indeed, researches to find potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 are mainly focused on targeting virus-host interactions or inhibiting viral assembly. Additionally, drugs and other therapeutic agents that modulate broad-spectrum host innate immune responses or interfere with signaling pathways involved in viral replication are important. These drugs may be capable of engaging host receptors or proteases utilized for viral entry or may impact the endocytosis pathway. 3CLpro (3-chymotrypsin-like protease), PLpro (papain-like protease), RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), S protein (viral spike glycoprotein), TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2), ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), and AT2 (angiotensin AT2 receptor) are important targets. With no approved therapies, this pandemic illustrates the urgent need for safe and broad-spectrum antiviral agents and strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and future pathogenic viruses. In this review, we discussed about the recent trends and important challenges regarding the potential inhibitors, antiviral drugs and nanomaterials screened against SARS-CoV-2.","Jamalipour Soufi, Ghazaleh; Iravani, Siavash",Journal of drug targeting,https://doi.org/10.1080/1061186x.2020.1853736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33210953/,550

MATERIALS AND METHODS The patient is a 32 year-old female with a giant, benign splenic cyst causing persistent abdominal pain. Preoperative imaging showed a cystic lesion measuring 8.3 × 7.6 cm, in the middle portion of the spleen. Due to the central location of the bulky lesion a partial splenectomy was not feasible. As an alternative to a total splenectomy, a possible reimplantation of hemi-spleen after bench surgery was offered. We proceeded with a robotic total splenectomy and bench hemisplenectomy, preserving the lower pole and a portion of the middle segment of the organ. A robotic reconstruction of the splenic vessels was then performed intra-abdominally. The reperfusion was optimal. RESULTS The total operative time was 305 min, with 78 min of robotic time. Postoperative ultrasound confirmed a patent arterial and venous flow. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 4. The pathology report was consistent with epithelial cyst of the spleen. The patient is doing well at 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The optimized vision and dexterity provided by the robotic system allowed a safe and precise reconstruction of the splenic vessels, even in a deep and narrow operative field. Partial splenectomy with autotransplantation of the organ was thus achieved, avoiding a total splenectomy in a young patient.","Giulianotti, Pier Cristoforo; Daskalaki, Despoina; Gonzalez-Ciccarelli, Luis F; Bianco, Francesco M",Journal of robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-016-0635-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27514639/,550

METHODS Twelve experts in gynecological cancer designed an electronic survey, according to recommendations from international societies, using an online platform. The survey included 22 questions on five topics: consultation care, preinvasive cervical pathology, and cervical, ovarian, and endometrial cancer. The questionnaire was distributed to 1052 specialists in 14 Latin American countries. A descriptive analysis was carried out using statistical software. RESULTS A total of 610 responses were received, for an overall response rate of 58.0%. Respondents favored offering teleconsultation as triage for post-cancer treatment follow-up (94.6%), neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer (95.6%), and total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and defining adjuvant treatment with histopathological features in early stage endometrial cancer (85.4%). Other questions showed agreement rates of over 64%, except for review of pathology results in person and use of upfront concurrent chemoradiation for early stage cervical cancer (disagreement 56.4% and 58.9%, respectively). CONCLUSION Latin American specialists accepted some alternative management strategies for gynecological cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may reflect the region's particularities.","Rodriguez, Juliana; Fletcher, Angélica; Heredia, Fernando; Fernandez, Robinson; Ramírez Salazar, Heidy; Sanabria, Daniel; Burbano Luna, Javier; Guerrero, Eduardo; Pierre, Marc-Edy; Rendón, Gabriel J; Rosero, Indira; Trujillo, Lina María; Ribeiro, Reitan; Baiocchi, Glauco; Lopez Blanco, Aldo; Malca, Magaly; Hoegl, Jorge; Borges Garnica, Alfredo; Lasso de la Vega, Jorge; Scasso, Santiago; Laufer, Joel; Estrada, Erick Estuarto; Gutierrez Criado, Armando; Herbert Nuñez, Guillermo Sidney; Cantú-de Leon, David; Medina, Gonzalo; Pendola Gómez, Luis; Saadi, José; Noll, Florencia; Arévalo Sandoval, Danilo; Ferreira Oliveira, Alexandre; Pareja, Rene",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32526044/,550
85791,Showing Up Is Half the Battle: The Impact of Telehealth on Psychiatric Appointment Attendance for Hospital-Based Intensive Outpatient Services During COVID-19.,2021-05-17,"Uruguay River is the most important river in western Rio Grande do Sul, separating Brazil from Argentina and Uruguay. However, its pollution is of great concern due to agricultural activities in the region and the extensive use of pesticides. In a long term, this practice leads to environmental pollution, especially to the aquatic system. The objective of this study was to analyze the physicochemical characteristics, metals and pesticides levels in water samples obtained before and after the planting and pesticides' application season from three sites: Uruguay River and two minor affluents, Mezomo Dam and Salso Stream. For biomonitoring, the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was used, which were exposed for 24 h. We did not find any significant alteration in physicochemical parameters. In the pre- and post-pesticides' samples we observed a residual presence of three pesticides (tebuconazole, imazethapyr, and clomazone) and metals which levels were above the recommended (As, Hg, Fe, and Mn). Exposure to both pre- and post-pesticides' samples impaired C. elegans reproduction and post-pesticides samples reduced worms' survival rate and lifespan. PCA analysis indicated that the presence of metals and pesticides are important variables that impacted C. elegans biological endpoints. Our data demonstrates that Uruguay River and two affluents are contaminated independent whether before or after pesticides' application season. In addition, it reinforces the usefulness of biological indicators, since simple physicochemical analyses are not sufficient to attest water quality and ecological safety.","Kuhn, Eugênia Carla; Jacques, Maurício Tavares; Teixeira, Daniela; Meyer, Sören; Gralha, Thiago; Roehrs, Rafael; Camargo, Sandro; Schwerdtle, Tanja; Bornhorst, Julia; Ávila, Daiana Silva",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11986-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411293/,550

The brain is central in both behavioural and physiological responses to threatening stimuli and, given its tight metabolic and haemodynamic requirements, is particularly susceptible to environmental stress. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF, duplex ultrasound), cerebral oxygen delivery (CDO2 ), oesophageal temperature, and arterial blood gases during exposure to three commonly experienced environmental stressors - heat, cold and hypoxia - in isolation, and in combination. Twelve healthy male subjects (27 ± 11 years) underwent core cooling by 1.0 °C and core heating by 1.5 °C in randomized order at sea-level; acute hypoxia (PetO2 = 50 mmHg) was imposed at baseline and at each thermal extreme. Core cooling and heating protocols were repeated after 16 ± 4 days residing at 4330m to investigate any interactions with high altitude acclimatization. Cold stress decreased CBF by 20-30% and CDO2 by 12-19% (both p<0.01) irrespective of altitude, whereas heating did not reliably change either CBF or CDO2 (both p>0.08). The increases in CBF with acute hypoxia during thermal stress were appropriate to maintain CDO2 at normothermic, normoxic values. Reaction time was faster and slower by 6-9% with heating and cooling, respectively (both p<0.01), but central (brain) processes were not impaired by any combination of environmental stressors. These findings highlight the powerful influence of core cooling in reducing CDO2 . Despite these large reductions in CDO2 with cold stress, gross indices of cognition remained stable.

So far, a TLVR of >350 mL was considered to be indicative of a positive response to treatment. However, it is not really known what amount of TLVR is crucial following valve implantation. Patients and methods TLVR, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), residual volume (RV) and 6-minute walk distance (6-MWD) were assessed before and 3 months after valve implantation in 119 patients. TLVR was calculated based on computed tomography (CT) scan analysis using imaging software (Apollo; VIDA Diagnostics). Minimal important difference estimates were calculated by anchor-based and distribution-based methods. Results Patients treated with valves experienced a mean change of 0.11 L in FEV1, -0.51 L in RV, 44 m in 6-MWD and a TLVR of 945 mL. Using a linear regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis based on two of three anchors (ΔFEV1, ΔRV), the estimated minimal important difference for TLVR was between 890 and 1,070 mL (ie, 49%-54% of the baseline TLV). Conclusion In future, a TLVR between 49% and 54% of the baseline TLV, should be used when interpreting the clinical relevance.","Gompelmann, D; Kontogianni, K; Schuhmann, M; Eberhardt, R; Heussel, C P; Herth, F J",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s152029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29440884/,550

Capitalising on their colour-tuneable behaviour (in the sense that they adopt different colours with respect to the incident radiation), C-dot-based compositions are ideal for the visual enhancement of latent fingerprints, affording improved contrast against multicoloured and patterned backgrounds. As highly sensitive and highly selective optical nanoprobes, C-dots show excellent analytical performance in detecting biological compounds, drugs, explosives, heavy metals and poisonous reactants. In addition, benefiting from their versatile structural and chemical composition, C-dots can be incorporated into ink and polymeric formulations capable of functioning as a new generation of cost-effective barcodes and security nanotags for object authentication and anti-counterfeit applications.

STUDY DESIGN This is a retrospective review at a tertiary academic hospital with institutional review board approval. METHODS All patients undergoing endoscopic repair of Zenker's diverticulum between April 1, 2009 and December 1, 2010 at a single institution were studied. RESULTS A total of 65 endoscopic diverticulostomies were performed: 24 Harmonic assisted, 41 stapler assisted. Average diverticulum size was 3.46 cm. There were two complications with staple-assisted (pharyngeal leak and recurrence) and six complications with Harmonic-assisted diverticulostomies (two pharyngeal leaks, two chest pains, one recurrence, and one subcutaneous emphysema). There was a statistically significant difference in the complication rates between the staple-assisted (4.88%) and Harmonic-assisted (25%) cohorts (P = .04). There were no complications with diverticula <2 cm. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopic Harmonic esophagodiverticulostomy has been reported for the treatment of Zenker's diverticula.

103622,The Drum Must Beat On: COVID-19 and the U.S. Military's Virtual Health Response in Europe.,2020-12-28,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY During the last months, a pandemic by a novel coronavirus (Sars-Cov-2) has spread worldwide, putting hospitals under enormous pressure. Although follow-up data in this setting are scarce, early reports suggested that more than 80% of patients who had recovered from COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) reported persistence of at least one symptom during follow-up. Therefore, a prolonged post-discharge monitoring for long-lasting effects is advisable. We assessed the feasibility of cardiorespiratory home monitoring through a wearable device in post-COVID-19 patients. METHODS In this pilot study, we enrolled patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 after hospital discharge at home. A wearable device, consisting of a technologically advanced T-Shirt composed of ink-based dry electrodes linked to standard 12-lead ECG monitoring, 5 respiratory strain sensors, 1 accelerometer, a digital pulse oximeter (L.I.F.E.) was used. Monitoring was carried out for at least 7 days and comprehended a two-hour monitoring period a day during rest and a short exercise (6 minutes of brisk walking) and an overnight sleep monitoring on the last day. RESULTS Seventeen COVID-19 patients (male 8; age 54.4±15.3 year old; BMI 25.1±3.1) were enrolled at hospital discharge. They underwent 12.5±2.5 (7-17) days of monitoring. At hospital discharge, cardiorespiratory parameters were good, and no significant changes were observed between the first and the last day of monitoring (baseline vs last day: rest SpO2 96.91.8 vs 96.81.8, exercise SpO2 95.72.7 vs 95.71.8, rest respiratory rate 17.53.3 vs 17.63.5, exercise respiratory rate 25.56.5 vs 23.54.8, all p > 0.05). Twelve patients (70.6%) performed the nighttime monitoring. Among them, one showed an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 20, suggestive of moderate sleep apnea syndrome. Small technical problems (e.g. connection of the device to the Wi-Fi line) were solved with remote assistance. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that a post-discharge home monitoring program for COVID-19 patients is feasible and safe. The L.I.F.E. T-Shirt device was able to collect a full set of cardiorespiratory parameters (i.e. heart rate, a full ECG, respiratory rate, SpO2), both at rest and during a brief exercise. We identified one patient without any previous disease who presented a sleep apnea syndrome.

104903,Impact of enhanced personal protective equipment on the physical and mental well-being of healthcare workers during COVID-19.,2020-12-03,"The coronavirus disease pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide threat to public health that has significantly affected the United States. The pandemic poses a variety of health risks including stressful disruptions in social and economic activity. Understanding the pandemic's effects on already vulnerable populations, such as individuals with chronic pain, may inform healthcare preparation for future catastrophic events. Given the association between excessive discounting of delayed rewards and chronic pain, this study examined relationships between delay discounting, pain severity, and COVID-19 perceived stress in individuals with chronic pain. Individuals reporting chronic pain (N = 180; 41% female; 86% white; 59% with a college degree) were recruited via the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform in this cross-sectional study. Measures of pain severity, delay discounting, probability discounting, and COVID-19 perceived stress were collected. Delay discounting was a significant predictor of overall pain severity (p < .02) and COVID-19 perceived stress (p < .001). Also, the magnitude of COVID-19 perceived stress fully mediated the relationship between delay discounting and overall pain severity (p = .004). Probability discounting was not a significant predictor of pain severity or COVID-19 perceived stress (p > .05). These findings highlight the importance of excessive discounting of delayed rewards as a potential determinant of pain severity as well as predictor of perceived stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the discounting of delayed rewards is of particular therapeutic importance for individuals with chronic pain in the context of stressful events.

These injuries are believed to occur because of repeated microtrauma to soft tissues caused by the repetitive mechanical strain of throwing. Researchers and practitioners have suggested that baseball pitchers' workloads are a significant risk factor for injury in adolescent players, resulting in lost time and slowing of performance development. The purpose of our review was to investigate the current research relative to monitoring workload in baseball throwers and discuss techniques for managing and regulating cumulative stress on the arm, with a focus on preventing injury and optimizing performance in adolescent baseball pitchers.","Dowling, Brittany; McNally, Michael P; Chaudhari, Ajit M W; Oñate, James A",Journal of athletic training,https://doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-0511-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991703/,550

A double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLET) has been developed for better airway management during PDT. The current study prospectively evaluated the in vivo feasibility, gas exchange, and airway pressures during PDT with DLET compared with a conventional endotracheal tube (ETT). METHODS According to eligibility criteria, patients were divided into a case group (those receiving PDT with DLET) and a control group (those receiving PDT with a conventional ETT). The Ciaglia single-dilator technique was used for PDT in both groups. The primary end point of this study was the feasibility of tracheostomy with DLET. The secondary end points were a comparison of gas exchange, airway pressures, minute volume, and tidal volume before, during, and after PDT performed with DLET and conventional ETT. RESULTS Ten patients meeting the inclusion criteria were assigned to each group. PDTs were performed without difficulties in nine patients in the DLET group and 10 patients in the conventional ETT group. During PDT, gas exchange, airway pressures, and minute ventilation remained more stable in the DLET group and were significantly different from those in the conventional ETT group. CONCLUSIONS PDT with DLET can be performed safely without difficulties limiting the technique. Furthermore, during PDT, the use of the DLET resulted in more stable gas exchange, airway pressures, and ventilation than PDT with a conventional ETT.

110386,Rapid Increase in Telemental Health Within the Department of Veterans Affairs During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-09-14,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) have emerged and spread throughout the porcine industry in many countries and are economically important pathogens causing diarrhea in sows and acute death in newborn piglets. Therefore, a sensitive diagnostic method would be beneficial for the prevention and control of PEDV and PDCoV infection. However, traditional detection methods have a number of drawbacks. This research aimed to establish a rapid detection method of duplex recombinant enzyme-mediated thermostatic amplification (RT-RPA) for PEDV and PDCoV. In this study, eight pairs of primers were designed for each virus according to the conserved domains of both PEDV and PDCoV from the NCBI Genbank, and one pair of primers was selected for each virus following the test results. After optimization of the reaction time, reaction temperature and primer concentration ratio, the duplex RT-RPA assay amplified a 226-bp fragment specifically for PEDV and a 321-bp fragment specifically for PDCoV. Meanwhile, the specificity and sensitivity of the primers and clinical samples were tested to verify the establishment of the RT-RPA method. The sensitivities of the duplex RT-RPA method for PEDV and PDCoV were 1 × 102 copies/μL. The results were consistent with PCR results and showed that a detection method for PEDV and PDCoV duplex RT-RPA was successfully established. In summary, the duplex recombinase polymerase amplification method could offer a promising alternative to the duplex RT-qPCR for detection of PEDV and PDCoV.","Li, Gen; Wu, Miaoli; Li, Jinhui; Cai, Weiyou; Xie, Yongsheng; Si, Guangbing; Xiao, Li; Cong, Feng; He, Dongsheng",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.114096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33600848/,550
111321,Psychological impact on women health workers involved in COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan: a cross-sectional study.,2020-05-04,"Intensive Care Unit (ICU) survivorship is associated with long-term cognitive impairment (LTCI). Our work has found post-ICU depression in up to 30%, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in up to 10% of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) survivors. We hypothesized that post-ICU depression and PTSD are independently associated with LTCI in ICU survivors. METHODS This is a five-center nested prospective cohort of critically ill patients admitted to medical and surgical ICUs who underwent neuropsychological assessments at 3 and 12 months post hospital discharge. Our primary outcome was global cognition using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and Trail Making Part B, a test of executive functioning, at 3 and 12 month follow-up. Our independent variables were Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the PTSD Checklist (PCL-S) measured at 3 and 12 months. We performed multivariable linear regression models controlling for covariates such as age, years of education, pre-existing cognitive impairment, comorbidities, ventilator days, hypoxemia episodes, and days of delirium or coma. RESULTS Of 1047 patients in the combined cohort, 679 were alive and available for follow-up at 3-months. A total of 590 (87%) ICU survivors completed at least one 3-month assessment, and of the 554 who survived to 12-months, 519 (94%) completed both a 3- and 12-month assessment with a median age of 61 years (52-70), mean daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 6 (4 - 8), 520 (88%) mechanically ventilated, and 420 (71%) with delirium. Of these, 113 (19%) had PTSD and 187 (32%) had depression at 3 months with similar rates at 12-months. Depression at 3-months was associated with lower 3-month RBANS (coefficient=-2.25; -3.10, -1.39) and lower Trails B scores at both 3- (OR 0.69; 0.56, 0.85) and 12-months (OR 0.66; 0.52, 0.84). PTSD at 3-months had no association with RBANS or Trails B scores at 3- or 12 months. CONCLUSIONS Early post-ICU depression, but not PTSD, is independently associated with co-existing LTCI, even when controlling for past ICU delirium. Treatment for early depression represents a novel intervention area for LTCI prevention in ICU survivors.

METHODS Single-centre prospective observational study. Preterm infants born <1500-g birth weight were eligible. Infants were observed for pre-measurement behaviour state using a five-point neonatal behaviour observation tool. One infrared temperature was taken from each of the devices, followed by an axillary measurement. Further behaviour-state observations were recorded following infrared and axillary measurements. RESULTS One hundred measurements were collected from each infrared device among a cohort of 42 very low birth weight infants. Only one infrared device showed satisfactory agreement with bias -0.071 (95% limits of agreement -0.68 to 0.54). The other two devices demonstrated poor agreement: bias -1.34; 95% limits of agreement -2.62 to -0.5 and bias -0.56; 95% limits of agreement -1.38 to 0.25. Neonatal behavioural scores showed only minimal changes when infrared measurements were performed but increased significantly following axillary measurements. The difference between the two modalities was statistically significant with a mean increase of 1.44 points following axillary measurements (95% confidence interval 1.21 to 1.67, P < 0.001).

This study aimed to identify predictors of failed reperfusion. METHODS In this study 2211 patients from the German Stroke Registry who received EVT for anterior circulation stroke were retrospectively analyzed. Failure of reperfusion was defined as thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) grades 0/1/2a, and sufficient reperfusion as TICI 2b/3. In 1629 patients with complete datasets, associations between failure of reperfusion and baseline clinical data, comorbidities, location of occlusion, and procedural data were assessed with multiple logistic regression. RESULTS Failure of reperfusion occurred in 371 patients (16.8%) and was associated with the following locations of occlusion: cervical internal carotid artery (ICA, adjusted odds ratio, OR 2.01, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.08-3.69), intracranial ICA without carotid T occlusion (adjusted OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.05-2.98), and M2 segment (adjusted OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.21-2.84). Failed reperfusion was also associated with cervical ICA stenosis (>70% stenosis, adjusted OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.69-4.97), stroke of other determined etiology by TOAST (Trial of ORG 10172 in acute stroke treatment) criteria (e.g. nonatherosclerotic vasculopathies, adjusted OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.36-5.39), and treatment given outside the usual working hours (adjusted OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.07-1.86). Successful reperfusion was associated with higher Alberta stroke program early CT score (ASPECTS) on initial imaging (adjusted OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.92), treatment with the patient under general anesthesia (adjusted OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54-0.96), and concomitant ICA stenting in patients with ICA stenosis (adjusted OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.11-0.38). CONCLUSION Several factors are associated with failure of reperfusion, most notably occlusions of the proximal ICA and low ASPECTS on admission. Conversely, stent placement in the proximal ICA was associated with reperfusion success.","Flottmann, Fabian; Broocks, Gabriel; Faizy, Tobias Djamsched; McDonough, Rosalie; Watermann, Lucas; Deb-Chatterji, Milani; Thomalla, Götz; Herzberg, Moriz; Nolte, Christian H; Fiehler, Jens; Leischner, Hannes; Brekenfeld, Caspar",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-020-00880-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32067055/,550

Several syndemic conditions have been linked with HIV acquisition and transmission among SGML including immigration, discrimination, environmental racism, substance use, and mental health. AREAS COVERED We provide a summary of biomedical, behavioral, and social/structural interventions to reduce risks for acquiring HIV and improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum among SGML. We also discuss intervention approaches and opportunities that respond at the intersection of HIV and COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Effective strategies are required to adequately respond, adapt, and continue to provide health and social services during a public health emergency. EXPERT OPINION There is a dire need for the combination of biomedical, behavioral, and social/structural interventions to reduce risks for acquiring HIV and improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum. Interventions and combination approaches should be driven by community-based participatory action research. The inclusion of community members in all stages of the research process can assure successful implementation of program activities and deliverables, including the provision of culturally and linguistically appropriate services. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, which is disproportionately impacting individuals living with HIV and other comorbidities, the elderly, and under-resourced communities with a ferocity not seen in other communities, intervention approaches that respond at the intersection of HIV and COVID-19 prevention and treatment are also urgently needed.","Martinez, Omar",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2020.1819790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32902348/,550

120874,Call for urgent actions in societies and health systems in the Western Pacific Region to implement the WHO Regional Action Plan on Healthy Ageing.,2021-04-27,"BACKGROUND Frailty, a state of decreased physiological reserve, is strongly associated with perioperative mortality in older adults. However, the mechanism by which frailty is associated with mortality is not yet understood. Autonomic dysfunction in the form of decreased intraoperative hemodynamic variability has been shown to be associated with increased mortality. We aimed to see whether frail patients have less hemodynamic variability under anesthesia and whether variability mediates the relationship between frailty and 30-day mortality. METHODS We performed a single-center retrospective study of 1223 patients ≥65 years of age undergoing surgery between July 2008 and December 2012. We used markers of frailty: age >70, preoperative body mass index <18.5, hematocrit <35%, albumin <3.4 g/dL, and creatinine >2.0 mg/dL. We modeled the outcome of 30-day mortality with number of frailty conditions adjusting for gender, length of surgery, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, and need for transfusion. Intraoperative hemodynamic variability was defined as the count of episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional mean arterial pressure (MAP) between consecutive 5-minute intervals. We evaluated the role of intraoperative hemodynamic variability as a mediator (modifier) of the relationship between frailty and mortality, checking for 3 conditions: (1) frailty must affect episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP; (2) episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP must affect 30-day mortality; and (3) mediation effect is significant. We used the product method, in which the mediation effect was estimated as the product of the first 2 relationships. Then we applied the percentile bootstrap method to obtain the 95% CI for the estimate of mediation effect. RESULTS Number of frailty conditions and episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP were inversely proportional. Presence of ≥4 frailty conditions was associated with >40% reduction of the number of episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP. Regarding mortality, episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP were protective. The addition of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP in the mortality model resulted in a decrease in the frailty odds ratio from 10.6 to 9.1 (4+ conditions), suggesting that episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP are indeed a mediator. The mediation effect was modest; 5 episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP was 5.2%, 6.4%, 6.9%, and 9.0% for frailty conditions from 1 to 4+, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Frailty is associated with less intraoperative blood pressure variation, and the relationship of frailty with 30-day mortality is partially mediated by episodes of absolute change >15% in fractional MAP. This suggests that autonomic dysregulation may be a modest part of the mechanism behind the association between frailty and perioperative mortality. Our finding is consistent with recent literature, suggesting that an intact autonomic nervous system confers lower perioperative mortality.","James, Leslie A; Levin, Matthew A; Lin, Hung-Mo; Deiner, Stacie G",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000004085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30801361/,550

However, it is unknown whether the changes in heart rate variability precede neurological deterioration in such patients. We explored the changes in heart rate variability measured by electrocardiography in patients who had neurological deterioration following severe acute brain injury and examined the relationship between heart rate variability and electroencephalography parameters. Methods Retrospective analysis of 25 patients who manifested neurological deterioration after severe acute brain injury and underwent simultaneous electroencephalography plus electrocardiography monitoring. Results Eighteen electroencephalography channels and one simultaneously recorded electrocardiography channel were segmented into epochs of 120-second duration and processed to compute 10 heart rate variability parameters and three quantitative electroencephalography parameters. Raw electroencephalography of the epochs was also assessed by standardized visual interpretation and categorized based on their background abnormalities and ictal-interictal continuum patterns. The heart rate variability and electroencephalography parameters showed consistent changes in the 2-day period before neurological deterioration commenced. Remarkably, the suppression ratio and background abnormality of the electroencephalography parameters had significant reverse correlations with all heart rate variability parameters. Conclusion We observed a significantly progressive decline in heart rate variability from the day before the neurological deterioration events in patients with severe acute brain injury were first observed.","Lee, Hyunjo; Jeon, Sang-Beom; Lee, Kwang-Soo",Acute and critical care,https://doi.org/10.4266/acc.2020.00703; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730778/,550

Among the 27 frequently ill infants, only eight (5.3%) out of 150 MSIs were prolonged (> or =2 weeks duration). Considering all samples, detection of the same virus strain > or =2 weeks apart was unusual (5.3% of all 244 positive findings). Human rhinovirus infections occur early, pervasively and repetitively in these high-risk infants. Infants with prolonged or recurrent respiratory illnesses most often have a series of infections rather than persistent infection with one virus strain.","Jartti, T; Lee, W-M; Pappas, T; Evans, M; Lemanske, R F; Gern, J E",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00161907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18448489/,550
124079,Impact of COVID-19 on Peer Support Specialists in the United States: Findings From a Cross-Sectional Online Survey.,2021-06-23,"OBJECTIVE Spacer gel is used to reduce the rectal dose in prostate radiotherapy. It is injected to increase the distance between the prostate and rectum. During the course of external radiotherapy treatment, physiological changes in rectal volume exist. When using polyethylene glycol material, such as DuraSeal(®) (Covidien, Mansfield, MA), gel resorption also occurs. Together, these factors alter the original dose plan distribution. METHODS External dose planning and calculations were simulated using images acquired from 10 patients who were treated with brachytherapy and gel. The CT series was taken relative to gel injection: pre 1 day, post 1 day, post 1 month and post 2 months. Adaptive planning was compared with a single plan. RESULTS Adaptive planning shows better results compared with the single plan used in the total treatment course; however, the effect is minor. CONCLUSION Gel usage is clearly favourable to rectal DVH. Using adaptive planning with gel improves rectal DVH but is not necessary according to this study. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE Spacer gel is used in prostate radiotherapy to increase distance between the prostate and the rectum, thus reducing the rectal doses. During the treatment course, gel resorption exists which affects the rectal doses. The usefulness of adaptive planning to compensate this resorption effect has not been studied before.","Heikkilä, Vesa-Pekka",The British journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20150421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26370300/,550

125942,Positive psychological impact of treating victims of politically motivated violence among hospital-based health care providers.,2008,"OBJECTIVE To describe the methodological characteristics and good research practices of COVID-19 interventional studies developed in Brazil in the first months of the pandemic. METHODS We reviewed the bulletin of the National Research Ethics Committee - Coronavirus Special Edition (Comissão Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa - CONEP-COVID) (May 28, 2020) and the databases of the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry (Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos - ReBEC) to identify interventional studies registered in Brazil that assessed drug type, biological therapy, or vaccines. We described their methodological characteristics and calculated their power for different effect magnitudes. RESULTS A total of 62 studies were included, 55 retrieved from the CONEP website, and 7 from registry databases. The most tested pharmacological interventions in these studies were: chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, convalescent plasma, tocilizumab, sarilumab, eculizumab, vaccine, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, n-acetylcysteine, nitazoxanide, ivermectin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. Out of 22 protocols published on registry databases until May 2020, 18 (82%) were randomized clinical trials, and 13 (59%) had an appropriate control group. However, 9 (41%) of them were masked, and only 5 (24%) included patients diagnosed with a specific laboratory test (for example, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction - RT-PCR). Most of these studies had power > 80% only to identify large effect sizes. In the prospective follow-up, 60% of the studies available at CONEP until May 2020 had not been published on any registry platform (ICTRP/ReBEC/ClinicalTrials) by July 21, 2020. CONCLUSION The interventions evaluated during the Brazilian research response reflect those of international initiatives, but with a different distribution and a large number of studies assessing hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine. Limitations in methodological design and sample planning represent challenges that could affect the research outreach.","Ribeiro, Tatiane Bomfim; Mazotti, Talita Aona; Silva, Nayara Aparecida de Oliveira; Stein, Airton Tetelbom; Diaz-Quijano, Fredi Alexander; Melo, Daniela Oliveira de",Revista brasileira de epidemiologia = Brazilian journal of epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1590/1980-549720200104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33439937/,550

The sudden loss of livelihood and lack of access to health care and social protection intensified the vulnerabilities of sex workers, especially those living with HIV. In response, Ashodaya Samithi, an organization of more than 6000 sex workers, launched an innovative programme of assistance in four districts in Karnataka. Since access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) was immediately disrupted, Ashodaya adapted its HIV outreach programme to form an alternative, community-led system of distributing ART at discreet, private sites. WhatsApp messaging was used to distribute information on accessing government social benefits made available in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other assistance included advisory messages posted in WhatsApp groups to raise awareness, dispel myths and mitigate violence, and regular, discreet phone check-ins to follow up on the well-being of members. The lessons learnt from these activities represent an important opportunity to consider more sustainable approaches to the health of marginalized populations that can enable community organizations to be better prepared to respond to other public health crises as they emerge.","Reza-Paul, Sushena; Lazarus, Lisa; Haldar, Partha; Reza Paul, Manisha; Lakshmi, Bhagya; Ramaiah, Manjula; Pasha, Akram; Hafeez Ur Rahman, Syed; Venukumar, K T; Venugopa, M S; Rewari, Bharat Bhushan; Lorway, Robert",WHO South-East Asia journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.4103/2224-3151.294302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978341/,550

As a result there is a need for biomaterials designed to promote tissue regeneration and improve wound healing. This study assessed the effect of crosslinking of a porcine dermal collagen matrix with regard to strength of implant/host tissue integration, implant biocompatibility and general healing in a rodent model. Permacol™, a crosslinked acellular collagenous biomaterial was compared with its noncrosslinked equivalent at 3, 6, and 12 months postsubcutaneous implantation. Both matrices were well tolerated and showed no evidence of inflammation or adverse responses either in the host tissue or implants. Progressive integration of the implants with the surrounding tissue was observed. Cellular response was similar for both collagenous matrices although, at 3 and 6 months, noncrosslinked implants showed a significantly higher level of cellular penetration than crosslinked implants. However, at 12 months crosslinked implants showed significantly higher levels of cellular density, neo-vascularisation and integration with host tissue. Additionally, at long term, noncrosslinked implants lost volume suggesting some absorption. The crosslinking process does not seem to be detrimental to cellular response and biocompatibility.","de Castro Brás, Lisandra E; Proffitt, Joanne L; Bloor, Steve; Sibbons, Paul D","Journal of biomedical materials research.

Our experiment and simulation show that the output terahertz energy greatly enhances when the input laser pulse is highly chirped, contrary to a common optical rectification process. We find this abnormal behavior is attributed to a linear electro-optic (EO) effect, in which the laser pulse propagating in LiNbO3 is modulated by the terahertz field it produces, and this in turn drives optical rectification more effectively to produce the terahertz field. This resonant cascading effect can greatly increase terahertz conversion efficiencies when the input laser pulse is properly pre-chirped with additional third order dispersion. We also observe similar multicycle terahertz emission from lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) at 14 THz and barium borate (BBO) at 7 THz, 10.6 THz, and 14.6 THz, all produced by narrowband phase-matched optical rectification.","Jang, Dogeun; Kim, Ki-Yong",Optics express,https://doi.org/10.1364/oe.398268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680167/,550

In animal models, disruption of Rev-erbα results in global changes in exercise performance, oxidative capacity, and blood glucose levels. However, the complete extent to which Rev-erbα-mediated transcriptional repression of metabolism impacts cell function remains unknown. We hypothesized that loss of Rev-erbα in a mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) model would result in global changes in metabolism. MEFs lacking Rev-erbα exhibited a hypermetabolic phenotype, demonstrating increased levels of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Rev-erbα deletion increased expression of hexokinase II, transketolase, and ribose-5-phosphate isomerase genes involved in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and these effects were not mediated by the transcriptional activator BMAL1. Upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation was not accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis or numbers. Rev-erbα repressed proliferation via glycolysis, but not the PPP. When treated with H2O2, cell viability was reduced in Rev-erbα knockout MEFs, accompanied by increased ratio of oxidized/reduced NADPH, suggesting that perturbation of the PPP reduces capacity to mount an antioxidant defense. These findings uncover novel mechanisms by which glycolysis and the PPP are modulated through Rev-erbα, and provide new insights into how Rev-erbα impacts proliferation.","Gillis, Sean P; Yao, Hongwei; Rizal, Salu; Maeda, Hajime; Chang, Julia; Dennery, Phyllis A",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91516-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117285/,550

In this study, the microbial degradation of model (alkylated) PAHs (i.e., phenanthrene, 3-methylphenanthrene, 3,6-dimethylphenanthrene (36DMPhe), pyrene, and 1-methylpyrene (1MP)) by the bacterium Sphingobium quisquiliarum EPA505, a known degrader of PAHs, was studied. To evaluate the toxic potential of the metabolic products, reaction mixtures containing metabolites of 36DMPhe and 1MP were fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography, and their effects on the luminescence inhibition of Aliivibrio fischeri were evaluated. Although the luminescence inhibition of 36DMPhe and 1MP at their solubility levels was not observed, inhibition was observed in their metabolite fractions at the solubility limit of their parent molecule. This indicates that initial biotransformation increases the toxicity of alkylated PAHs because of the increased solubility and/or inherent toxicity of metabolites. Qualitative analysis of the metabolite fractions suggested that mono-oxidation of the methyl group is the main metabolic pathway of 36DMPhe and 1MP.","Lee, So-Young; Kwon, Jung-Hwan",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899285/,550

We constructed a fuel cell with an enzymatic cascade at the anode for efficient energy conversion. The construction involved fabrication of the flow-through cell by three-dimensional printing. Gold nanoparticles with covalently bound naphthoquinone moieties deposited on cellulose/polypyrrole (CPPy) paper allowed us to significantly improve the catalysis rate, both at the anode and cathode of the fuel cell. The enzymatic cascade on the anode consisted of invertase, mutarotase, Flavine Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent glucose dehydrogenase and fructose dehydrogenase. The multi-substrate anode utilized glucose, fructose, sucrose, or a combination of them, as the anode fuel and molecular oxygen were the oxidant at the laccase-based cathode. Laccase was adsorbed on the same type of naphthoquinone modified gold nanoparticles. Interestingly, the naphthoquinone modified gold nanoparticles acted as the enzyme orienting units and not as mediators since the catalyzed oxygen reduction occurred at the potential where direct electron transfer takes place. Thanks to the good catalytic and capacitive properties of the modified electrodes, the power density of the sucrose/oxygen enzymatic fuel cells (EFC) reached 0.81 mW cm-2, which is beneficial for a cell composed of a single cathode and anode.","Kizling, Michał; Dzwonek, Maciej; Nowak, Anna; Tymecki, Łukasz; Stolarczyk, Krzysztof; Więckowska, Agnieszka; Bilewicz, Renata",Nanomaterials,https://doi.org/10.3390/nano10081534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764356/,550

DESIGN We conducted a systematic review of early published, peer-reviewed, original research where researchers presented data from adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients regarding their presenting signs, symptoms and definitive survival outcomes. DATA SOURCES We searched the databases PubMed, CINAHL and Scopus for relevant articles published between 1 January 2020 - 18 May 2020. REVIEW METHODS We extracted data from each study and synthesized data across primary sources using a literature matrix table to provide a global impression of this rapidly growing body of literature RESULTS: We retrieved 97 mainly descriptive observational studies. SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently transmitted between humans, particularly those in close contact. Symptomatic COVID-19 patients can present with a broad array of nonspecific symptoms. Fever and cough are the most commonly reported symptoms; some patients have atypical presentations. In patients with respiratory decompensation, disease progression can be rapid. Some patients experience mild symptoms that are self-limited; others experience organ failure and death. Risk factors for poor outcomes include older age, chronic medical conditions, male gender, obesity and presenting with signs of declining respiratory status. CONCLUSION Nurses can mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and sequelae of COVID-19 with prompt and capable responses. IMPACT This study addresses the problem of the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 while little is known about this virus. This review provides nurses with a summary of the most current evidence regarding the signs, symptoms and outcomes of adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients that they might identify COVID-19 patients rapidly on presentation to medical care and be attuned to indicators of patient decompensation.","Keller, Kristin Garrett; Reangsing, Chuntana; Schneider, Joanne Kraenzle",Journal of advanced nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32881050/,550

Due to the rapid outbreak of the transmission (~3.64 million positive cases and high mortality as of May 5, 2020), the world is looking for immediate and better therapeutic options. Still, much information is not known, including origin of the disease, complete genomic characterization, mechanism of transmission dynamics, extent of spread, possible genetic predisposition, clinical and biological diagnosis, complete details of disease-induced pathogenicity, and possible therapeutic options. Although several known drugs are already under clinical evaluation with many in repositioning strategies, much attention has been paid to the aminoquinoline derivates, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). These molecules are known regulators of endosomes/lysosomes, which are subcellular organelles central to autophagy processes. By elevating the pH of acidic endosomes/lysosomes, CQ/HCQ inhibit the autophagic process. In this short perspective, we discuss the roles of CQ/HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and propose new ways of possible treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the molecules that selectivity target autophagy.","Bonam, Srinivasa Reddy; Muller, Sylviane; Bayry, Jagadeesh; Klionsky, Daniel J",Autophagy,https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2020.1779467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32522067/,550

A mechanism-based clinical framework for spinally referred pain has been proposed, which classifies into (1) somatic pain, (2) neural mechanosensitivity, (3) radicular pain, (4) radiculopathy and mixed pain presentations. This study aims to (i) investigate the application of the clinical framework in patients with neck-arm pain, (ii) determine their somatosensory, clinical and psychosocial profile and (iii) observe their clinical course over time. METHOD We describe a study protocol. Patients with unilateral neck-arm pain (n = 180) will undergo a clinical examination, after which they will be classified into subgroups according to the proposed clinical framework. Standardized quantitative sensory testing (QST) measurements will be taken in their main pain area and contralateral side. Participants will have to complete questionnaires to assess function (Neck Disability Index), psychosocial factors (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Depression, anxiety and stress scale), neuropathic pain (Douleur Neuropathique 4 Questions, PainDETECT Questionnaire) and central sensitization features (Central Sensitization Inventory). Follow-ups at three, six and 12 months include the baseline questionnaires. The differences of QST data and questionnaire outcomes between and within groups will be analyzed using (M)AN(C)OVA and/or regression models. Repeated measurement analysis of variance or a linear mixed model will be used to calculate the differences between three, six, and 12 months outcomes. Multiple regression models will be used to analyze potential predictors for the clinical course. CONCLUSION The rationale for this study is to assess the usability and utility of the proposed clinical framework as well as to identify possible differing somatosensory and psychosocial phenotypes between the subgroups. This could increase our knowledge of the underlying pain mechanisms. The longitudinal analysis may help to assess possible predictors for pain persistency.","Kapitza, Camilla; Lüdtke, Kerstin; Tampin, Brigitte; Ballenberger, Nikolaus",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33370389/,550
142801,A cross-sectional study of physical activity behaviour and associations with wellbeing during the UK coronavirus lockdown.,2021-03-03,"PURPOSE The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed almost every aspect of our lives. Young adults are vulnerable to pandemic-related adverse mental health outcomes, but little is known about the impact on adolescents. We examined factors associated with perceived changes in mood and anxiety among male youth in urban and Appalachian Ohio. METHODS In June 2020, participants in an ongoing male youth cohort study were invited to participate in an online survey that included questions about changes in mood, anxiety, closeness to friends and family, and the major impacts of the pandemic. Weighted log-binomial regression models were used to assess the risk of worsened mood and increased anxiety. Chi-square tests were used to examine the association between perceived changes in mood and anxiety and perceived changes in closeness to friends and family and open-ended responses to a question about COVID-19's impact on participants. RESULTS Perceived worsened mood and increased anxiety during the pandemic were associated with higher household socioeconomic status, older age, feeling less close to friends and family, and reporting that COVID-19 negatively affected mental health. A perceived increase in anxiety was also associated with a history of symptoms of depression or anxiety. CONCLUSIONS Specific subgroups of male youth may be at heightened risk of worsening mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions should target vulnerable adolescents and seek to increase closeness to social contacts. Such efforts could involve novel programs that allow youth to stay connected to friends, which might mitigate the negative impact on mental health.","Tetreault, Eleanor; Teferra, Andreas A; Keller-Hamilton, Brittney; Shaw, Shreya; Kahassai, Soliana; Curran, Hayley; Paskett, Electra D; Ferketich, Amy K",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.05.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34112599/,550

MATERIALS AND METHODS After IRB approval, all SIPES cases were prospectively collected, and the surgeons involved were polled for technical difficulties encountered and their operative solutions. RESULTS Over a period of 13 months, 224 pediatric SIPES cases were performed in 223 pediatric patients (92 female, 131 male) aged 3 weeks to 19 years. Among these were 130 appendectomies, 32 pyloromyotomies, 32 cholecystectomies, 11 inguinal hernia repairs, 6 Nissen fundoplications and 4 laparoscopic-assisted endorectal pullthrough procedures. Eighteen procedures (8%) employed a primary extra-umbilical instrument in addition to the transumbilical trocar(s). Thirty procedures (13%) begun via a single-site technique required additional trocars for completion. None required laparotomy. Intraoperative complications are discussed. The main challenges of SIPES are: (1) variable umbilical anatomy, (2) large size of current proprietary multitrocar devices, (3) trocar crowding, (4) intra-abdominal exposure, (5) fewer degrees of freedom, (6) clashing instruments, (7) in-line endoscope viewing, and (8) limited number of working ports.

144943,"Analysis of Telehealth Usage and Trends in the Military Health System, 2006-2018.",2021-03-17,"Measles virus (MV), one of the most contagious viruses infecting humans, causes a systemic infection leading to fever, immune suppression, and a characteristic maculopapular rash. However, the specific mechanism or mechanisms responsible for the spread of MV into the respiratory epithelium in the late stages of the disease are unknown. Here we show the crucial role of PVRL4 in mediating the spread of MV from immune to epithelial cells by generating a PVRL4 ""blind"" recombinant wild-type MV and developing a novel in vitro coculture model of B cells with primary differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells. We utilized the macaque model of measles to analyze virus distribution in the respiratory tract prior to and at the peak of MV replication. Expression of PVRL4 was widespread in both the lower and upper respiratory tract (URT) of macaques, indicating MV transmission can be facilitated by more than only epithelial cells of the trachea. Analysis of tissues collected at early time points after experimental MV infection demonstrated the presence of MV-infected lymphoid and myeloid cells contacting respiratory tract epithelium in the absence of infected epithelial cells, suggesting that these immune cells seed the infection in vivo. Thereafter, lateral cell-to-cell spread of MV led to the formation of large foci of infected cells in the trachea and high levels of MV infection in the URT, particularly in the nasal cavity. These novel findings have important implications for our understanding of the high transmissibility of measles.","Ludlow, Martin; Lemon, Ken; de Vries, Rory D; McQuaid, Stephen; Millar, Emma L; van Amerongen, Geert; Yüksel, Selma; Verburgh, R Joyce; Osterhaus, Albert D M E; de Swart, Rik L; Duprex, W Paul",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03258-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23365435/,550

METHODS A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and two Chinese academic databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang) for studies published from December 2019 to September 2020 that reported the prevalence of above mental health problems among children and adolescents. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the pooled prevalence. RESULTS Twenty-three studies (21 cross-sectional studies and 2 longitudinal studies) from two countries (i.e., China and Turkey) with 57,927 children and adolescents were identified. Depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and posttraumatic stress symptoms were assessed in 12, 13, 2, and 2 studies, respectively. Meta-analysis of results from these studies showed that the pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and posttraumatic stress symptoms were 29% (95%CI: 17%, 40%), 26% (95%CI: 16%, 35%), 44% (95%CI: 21%, 68%), and 48% (95%CI: -0.25, 1.21), respectively. The subgroup meta-analysis revealed that adolescents and females exhibited higher prevalence of depression and anxiety compared to children and males, respectively. LIMITATIONS All studies in meta-analysis were from China limited the generalizability of our findings. CONCLUSIONS Early evidence highlights the high prevalence of mental health problems among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among female and adolescents. Studies investigating the mental health of children and adolescents from countries other than China are urgently needed.","Ma, Lu; Mazidi, Mohsen; Li, Ke; Li, Yixuan; Chen, Shiqi; Kirwan, Richard; Zhou, Haixia; Yan, Na; Rahman, Atif; Wang, Weidong; Wang, Youfa",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34174475/,550

Our systematic review aimed at identifying the effects of orally administered LF against virus infections. The systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, BioRxiv.org and ClinicalTrials.gov from database inception to 7th January 2021. Eligible articles investigated any virus family and provided data on the effects of orally administered LF of any origin in the prevention and/or management of confirmed viral infections in people of any age. A narrative synthesis of the results was performed. Quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk-Of-Bias and ROBINS-1 tools. A total of 27 records were included, nine of which were registered protocols. We found data on Flaviviridae (n = 10), Retroviridae (n = 3), Coronaviridae (n = 2), Reoviridae (n = 2) and Caliciviridae (n = 1). Most published trials were at high risk of bias. The findings were heterogeneous across and within viral families regarding virological, immunological and biological response, with no clear conclusion. Some weak but positive results were reported about decrease of symptom severity and duration, or reduction in viral loads. Despite high tolerability, the effects of LF as oral supplement are still inconsistent, both in preventing and managing viral infections. Small sample sizes, variety in recruitment and treatment protocols, and low study quality may have contributed to such heterogeneity. Better-designed studies are needed to further investigate its potential benefits against viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2.","Sinopoli, Alessandra; Isonne, Claudia; Santoro, Maria Mercedes; Baccolini, Valentina",Reviews in medical virology,https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34133812/,550

Methods: SRs related to musculoskeletal physical therapy interventions were identified. The methodological quality of the SRs and articles cited by the SRs were assessed by two blinded reviewers. Data analysis was performed by a third blinded researcher. Additional comparisons were made based on the Journal Impact Factor, spin, financial bias, and conflict of interest. Results: Twenty-four SRs were identified; 21/24 SRs had 'critically low' quality on the AMSTAR 2. Thirty-four percent of included studies were 'low quality,' and 58% of SRs included studies that had unreported external validity. One-half of the SRs represented 'spin,' and one-third of the SRs generated conclusions based on low-quality clinical trials. Discussion: The 'critically low' SRs methodological quality was exacerbated by low-quality research inclusion. Most SRs failed to follow best practices, including prospective registration and integration of professional librarians in the search process. Based on the high proportion of SRs that include low-quality trials and overall low methodological quality, further discussion regarding practice recommendations on level vs. quality of evidence is warranted.

It is not known whether presence of multiple pathogens is due to prolonged infections or to frequent exposure. The aim of this study was to analyze short-term pathogen clearance from nasopharynx and the rate of new respiratory tract infections in febrile preschool children. METHODS Children (n = 207) with uncomplicated acute febrile illness 2-59 months of age presenting to a health center in Zanzibar, Tanzania, April-July 2011, were included. Paired nasopharyngeal swab samples, collected at enrolment and after 14 days, were analyzed by multiple real-time polymerase chain reaction for Adenovirus, bocavirus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Coronaviruses, Enterovirus, influenza A and B virus, metapneumovirus, measles virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, parainfluenza virus, Parechovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and Rhinovirus. An age-matched and geographically matched healthy control group (n = 166) underwent nasopharyngeal sampling on 1 occasion. RESULTS At baseline, 157/207 (76%) patients had at least 1 pathogen detected, in total 199 infections. At follow-up (day 14), 162/199 (81%) of these infections were not detected, including >95% of the previously detected infections with Enterovirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, metapneumovirus or parainfluenza virus. Still 115 (56%) children were positive for at least 1 pathogen at follow-up, of which 95/115 (83%) were not found at baseline. Detection of influenza B on day 14 was significantly associated with fever during follow-up. CONCLUSION The results suggest that children with acute febrile illness in Zanzibar rapidly clear respiratory tract infections but frequently acquire new infections within 14 days.","Elfving, Kristina; Shakely, Deler; Andersson, Maria; Baltzell, Kimberly; Msellem, Mwinyi I; Björkman, Anders; Mårtensson, Andreas; Petzold, Max; Trollfors, Birger; Lindh, Magnus",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000001876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29889810/,550

Different simulation strategies can be included in the diverse clinical care phases for these patients. OBJECTIVE To suggest a complete simulation-based training program for Brazilian hospitals and/or academic institutions at this moment of the pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING Descriptive analysis on possible simulated clinical cases using different methodologies, thereby supporting suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. METHODS This was a reflective theoretical descriptive study on an educational program based on clinical simulation, with four practical phases at different performance and complexity levels. Wearing, handling and adequately disposing of personal protective equipment, along with specific respiratory procedures in different healthcare settings up to intensive care for seriously infected patients were addressed. RESULTS This program was designed for application at different Brazilian healthcare levels through different clinical simulation strategies. Summaries of expected performance were suggested in order to standardize technical capacity within these simulation settings, so as to serve these levels. CONCLUSIONS Developing training programs for situations such as the current COVID-19 pandemic promotes safety not only for patients but also for healthcare workers. In the present context, clear definition of which patients need hospital outpatient or inpatient care will avoid collapse of the Brazilian healthcare system. Institutions that do not have simulated environments can, through the examples described, adopt procedures to promote didactic information in order to help healthcare professionals during this time.","Brandão, Carolina Felipe Soares; Vaccarezza, Gabriela Furst; Bizario, João Carlos da Silva; Gois, Aécio Flavio Teixeira de",Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,https://doi.org/10.1590/1516-3180.2020.0155.r2.15062020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32813844/,550
160118,Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccination Among Health System Personnel.,2021,"A central question in ecology and evolution is to understand why sexual selection varies so much in strength across taxa; it has long been known that ecological factors are crucial to this. Temperature is a particularly salient abiotic ecological factor that modulates a wide range of physiological, morphological and behavioural traits, impacting individuals and populations at a global taxonomic scale. Furthermore, temperature exhibits substantial temporal variation (e.g. daily, seasonally and inter-seasonally), and hence for most species in the wild sexual selection will regularly unfold in a dynamic thermal environment. Unfortunately, studies have so far almost completely neglected the role of temperature as a modulator of sexual selection. Here, we outline the main pathways through which temperature can affect the intensity and form (i.e. mechanisms) of sexual selection, via: (i) direct effects on secondary sexual traits and preferences (i.e. trait variance, opportunity for selection and trait-fitness covariance), and (ii) indirect effects on key mating parameters, sex-specific reproductive costs/benefits, trade-offs, demography and correlated abiotic factors. Building upon this framework, we show that, by focusing exclusively on the first-order effects that environmental temperature has on traits linked with individual fitness and population viability, current global warming studies may be ignoring eco-evolutionary feedbacks mediated by sexual selection. Finally, we tested the general prediction that temperature modulates sexual selection by conducting a meta-analysis of available studies experimentally manipulating temperature and reporting effects on the variance of male/female reproductive success and/or traits under sexual selection. Our results show a clear association between temperature and sexual selection measures in both sexes. In short, we suggest that studying the feedback between temperature and sexual selection processes may be vital to developing a better understanding of variation in the strength of sexual selection in nature, and its consequences for population viability in response to environmental change (e.g. global warming).","García-Roa, Roberto; Garcia-Gonzalez, Francisco; Noble, Daniel W A; Carazo, Pau",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691483/,550

The evidence that 1 in 3 patients presented neuropsychiatric symptoms highlighted SARS-CoV-2 neurotropic properties. The involvement of the Central Nervous System (CNS) seems to be associated with poor prognosis, and it can occur independently of the respiratory system.ObjectivesTo assess neuropsychiatric symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 patients and possible mechanisms of CNS invasion;to reflect on what changes should be made in order to avoid short and long-term complications.MethodsA non-systematic literature review was performed, including publications between January and August 2020.ResultsThe most frequent CNS presentations included fatigue (38-75%), headache (6,5-34%), nausea or vomiting (1-13,7%). Regarding PNS involvement, three kinds of hypoesthesia (hyposmia, hypogeusia, and hypopsia) were commonly present. Additionally, cases of neurological syndromes associated with SARS-CoV2 were reported, being related to a poor prognosis in cases such as brainstem infiltration. Another major concern regarding CNS involvement is the possibility of permanent neurological disabilities. Importantly there are reports of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in CFS, without samples from nasopharyngeal swabs. Different hypothesis are postulated to explain possible mechanisms through which SARS-CoV-2 affects CNS, including: direct invasion through the olfactory nerve, hematogenous route through ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme) receptor expressed in blood-brain-barrier;or indirect mechanisms.ConclusionsHere we discuss the neuropsychiatric manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the potential mechanisms by which they occur at an early stage. Awareness, prevention and early treatment of potential neuropsychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 should not be overlooked, especially because they seem to predict a worse prognosis.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Nogueira, V.; Marguilho, M.; Pereira, I.; Teixeira, J.; Mendes, M.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.297,550

Incidentally, States and other actors have condemned this cyber pandemic and highlighted the incompatibility of these behaviours with international law and the framework of responsible State behaviour. From the perspective of international law, the rule of sovereignty appears to have a central role to play in addressing the malicious cyber activities that have taken advantage of the coronavirus pandemic. Indeed, most of these malicious cyber activities may only constitute breaches of sovereignty. Sovereignty is, however, among the most unsettled and contentious parts of international law, even among the so-called 'like-minded' States, which have expressed very different interpretations. Building on these observations, the present article investigates the different types of cyber operations that unfolded during the Covid-19 pandemic and questions their characterization in relation to the rules and principles of international law. It assesses the theoretical role of the rule of sovereignty in crisis management during a cyber pandemic as well as its actual use in State practice.

A proposed solution is that they might use the transitional probability between adjacent syllables, which drops at word boundaries. Here, we tested the limits of this mechanism by increasing the size of the word-unit to 4 syllables, and its automaticity by testing asleep neonates. Using markers of statistical learning in neonates’ EEG, compared to adult’ behavioral performances in the same task, we confirmed that statistical learning is automatic enough to be efficient even in sleeping neonates. But we also revealed that: 1) Successfully tracking transition probabilities in a sequence is not sufficient to segment it 2) Prosodic cues, as subtle as subliminal pauses, enable to recover segmenting capacities 3) Adults’ and neonates’ capacities are remarkably similar despite the difference of maturation and expertise. Finally, we observed that learning increased the similarity of neural responses across infants, providing a new neural marker to monitor learning. Thus, from birth, infants are equipped with adult-like tools, allowing to extract small coherent word-like units within auditory streams, based on the combination of statistical analyses and prosodic cues.","Benjamin, Lucas; Fló, Ana; Palu, Marie; Naik, Shruit; Melloni, Lucia; Dehane-Lambertz, Ghislaine",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.02.458702,550

Among the main detection approaches, the one based on crowd signals from DMND users has stood out by obtaining promising results. In essence, in order to classify a piece of news as fake or not fake, such approach explores the collective sense by combining opinions (signals, i.e., votes about the classification of some news) of a high number of users (crowd), considering the reputations of these users regarding their capacity of identifying Fake News. Although promising, the Crowd Signals approach has a significant limitation: it depends on the explicit user opinion (which is not always available) about the classification of the analyzed news. Such unavailability may be caused by the absence of a functionality in the DMND that collects user opinion about the news, or by the simple option of the users in not giving their opinion. Facing this limitation, the present work raises the hypothesis that it is possible to build models of Fake News detection with a performance comparable to the Crowd Signals based approach, avoiding the dependence on the explicit opinion of DMND users. To validate this hypothesis, the present work proposes HCS, an approach based on crowd signals that considers implicit user opinions instead of the explicit ones. The implicit opinions are inferred from the behavior of users concerning the dissemination of the news analyzed. Inspired in Meta-Learning, the HCS can also use the explicit opinions from machines (news classification models) to complement the implicit user opinions by means of hybrid Crowds. Experiments carried out in five datasets presented significant evidence that confirms the raised hypothesis. Even without considering DMND users’ explicit opinions, HCS was able to achieve results comparable to the ones produced by the Crowd Signals approach. Besides that, the results also revealed a performance improvement of HCS when the implicit opinions of the users were combined with the explicit opinions of machines.","Souza Freire, Paulo Márcio Matias da Silva Flávio Roberto Goldschmidt Ronaldo Ribeiro; en,",Expert Systems with Applications,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115414,550

166922,"A Malaria Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice Survey in a Rural Community in Guinea.",2021-06-23,"Background Environmental exposures such as smoking are widely recognized risk factors in the emergence of lung diseases including lung cancer and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the strength of environmental exposures is difficult to measure, making it challenging to understand their impacts. On the other hand, some COVID-19 patients develop ARDS in an unfavorable disease progression and smoking has been suggested as a potential risk factor among others. Yet initial studies on COVID-19 cases reported contradictory results on the effects of smoking on the disease – some suggest that smoking might have a protective effect against it while other studies report an increased risk. A better understanding of how the exposure to smoking and other environmental factors affect biological processes relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection and unfavorable disease progression is needed. Approach In this study, we utilize mutational signatures associated with environmental factors as sensors of their exposure level. Many environmental factors including smoking are mutagenic and leave characteristic patterns of mutations, called mutational signatures, in affected genomes. We postulated that analyzing mutational signatures, combined with gene expression, can shed light on the impact of the mutagenic environmental factors to the biological processes. In particular, we utilized mutational signatures from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) data set collected in TCGA to investigate the role of environmental factors in COVID-19 vulnerabilities. Integrating mutational signatures with gene expression in normal tissues and using a pathway level analysis, we examined how the exposure to smoking and other mutagenic environmental factors affects the infectivity of the virus and disease progression. Results By delineating changes associated with smoking in pathway-level gene expression and cell type proportions, our study demonstrates that mutational signatures can be utilized to study the impact of exogenous mutagenic factors on them. Consistent with previous findings, our analysis showed that smoking mutational signature (SBS4) is associated with activation of cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, leading to inflammatory responses. Smoking related changes in cell composition were also observed, including the correlation of SBS4 with the expansion of goblet cells. On the other hand, increased basal cells and decreased ciliated cells in proportion were associated with the strength of a different mutational signature (SBS5), which is present abundantly but not exclusively in smokers. In addition, we found that smoking increases the expression levels of genes that are up-regulated in severe COVID-19 cases. Jointly, these results suggest an unfavorable impact of smoking on the disease progression and also provide novel findings on how smoking impacts biological processes in lung.","Kim, Yoo-Ah; Hodzic, Ermin; Saslafsky, Ariella; Wojtowicz, Damian; Amgalan, Bayarbaatar; Przytycka, Teresa M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.461855,550

In the last decade recovery-oriented research and practice has increased greatly, however, a comprehensive model of recovery considering exclusively the perspectives of people with lived experience has not been devised. Aims: This review aimed to develop a framework and contextualise service users' and informal caregivers' understanding of recovery from severe mental health problems. Methods: A systematic search of 6 databases including key terms related to knowledge, experience and narratives AND mental health AND personal recovery. The search was supplemented with reference sourcing through grey literature, reference tracking and expert consultation. Data analysis consisted of a qualitative meta-synthesis using constant comparative methods. Results: Sixty-two studies were analysed. A pattern emerged regarding the recovery paradigms that the studies used to frame their findings. Recovery domains included Legal, political and economic recovery; Social recovery; Individual recovery; and Clinical recovery experience. Service users' definitions of recovery tended to prioritise social aspects, particularly being accepted and connecting with others, while caregivers focused instead on clinical definitions of recovery such as symptom remission. Both groups emphasised individual aspects such as becoming self-sufficient and achieving personal goals, which was strongly linked with having economic means for independence. Conclusions: The recovery model provided by this review offers a template for further research in the field and a guide for policy and practice. Predominant definitions of recovery currently reflect understandings of mental health which focus on an individual perspective, while this review found an important emphasis on socio-political aspects. At the same time, only a small number of studies took place in low-income countries, focused on minoritised populations, or included caregivers' perspectives. These are important gaps in the literature that require further attention.","Vera San Juan, N.; Gronholm, P.

The most vulnerable businesses to COVID-19 are micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Therefore, this paper aims to analyze the business vulnerability of MSMEs in Indonesia using the fuzzy spatial clustering approach. The fuzzy spatial clustering approach had been implemented to analyze the social vulnerability to natural hazards in Indonesia. Moreover, this study proposes the Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) to optimize the Fuzzy Geographically Weighted Clustering (FGWC) in order to cluster the business vulnerability in Indonesia. We performed the data analysis with the dataset from Indonesia's national socioeconomic and labor force survey (SUSENAS and SAKERNAS). We first compared the performance of FPA with traditional FGWC, as well as several known optimization algorithms in FGWC such as Artificial Bee Colony, Intelligent Firefly Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Gravitational Search Algorithm. Our results showed that FPAFGWC has the best performance in optimizing the FGWC clustering result in the business vulnerability context. We found that almost all of the regions in Indonesia outside Java Island have vulnerable businesses. Meanwhile, in most of Java Island, particularly the JABODETABEK area that is the national economic backbone, businesses are not vulnerable. Based on the results of the study, we provide the recommendation to handle the gap between the number of micro and small enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia.","Caraka, R. E.; Kurniawan, R.; Nasution, B.

Preliminary estimates now warn that drug overdose deaths likely surpassed 86 000 during 2020. Despite a 57.4% decrease in opioid prescribing since a peak in 2012, the opioid death rate has increased 105.8% through 2019, as the share of those deaths involving fentanyl increased from 16.4% to 72.9%. This letter seeks to determine whether the opioid prescribing and mortality paradox is robust to accepted methods of causal policy analysis and if prescribing rates mediate the effects of policy interventions on overdose deaths. Using loge-loge ordinary least squares with three different specifications as sensitivity analyses for all 50 states and Washington, DC for the period 2001-2019, the elasticities from the regressions with all control variables report operational prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) reduce prescribing rates 8.7%, while mandatory PDMPs increase death rates from opioids 16.6%, heroin and fentanyl 19.0%, cocaine 17.3% and all drugs 10.5%. There is also weak evidence that recreational marijuana laws reduce prescribing, increases in prescribing increase pain reliever deaths, pill mill laws increase cocaine deaths, and medical marijuana laws increase total overdose deaths, with demographic variables suggesting states with more male, less non-Hispanic white, and older citizens experience more overdoses. Weak mediation effects were observed for pain reliever, cocaine, and illicit opioid deaths, while broad reductions in prescribing have failed to reduce opioid overdoses.","Rich, J.

Ultraviolet light based on the excitation of mercury emit light at 254nm and has well established anti-microbial effects but the use hereof in populated areas is hindered by the carcinogenic properties of 254nm light. This is in contrast to the recently developed excimer lamps based on Krypton Chloride. These lamps emit light with a peak intensity at a wavelength of 222nm and have recently been demonstrated to have broad bactericidal and viricidal effects includ-ing efficient inactivation of SARS-CoV2. It is, however, unclear how efficiently 222nm lamps perform in a real-life setting such as a hospital waiting area. In this study we aimed to as-sess the antimicrobial efficacy of filtered 222nm excimer lamps in a real-world setting at an out-patient pulmonological clinic. Methods Filtered KrCl 222nm excimer lamps (UV222 lamps) were installed in a densely populated waiting room at the out-patient waiting area at department of Respiratory Diseases and Allergy at Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. Furniture sufaces were sampled and analyzed for bacterial load in a single arm interventional longitudinal study with and without exposure to filtered 222nm UVC-light. Furthermore, bacterial species were identi-fied using MALDI-ToF mass-spectrometry. Findings The exposure to filtered 222nm UVC-light significantly reduced the number of colony-forming-units, and patches with high desity of bacteria. Pathogenic bacteria such as Staphy-lococcus Aureus and Staphylococcus Epidermidis were detected only in the non-exposed areas suggesting that these species are highly sensitive to inactivation by 222nm UVC-light. Conclusion Filtered 222nm UVC-light is highly anti-microbial in a real-world clinical setting reducing bacterial load and eradicating clinically concerning bacteria species. Filtered 222nm UVC-light has the potential to become an important part of current and future anti-microbial measures in the clinic.","Holm, C. K.; Thyrsted, J.; Skaarup, S. H.; Hvass, A.

A cross-sectional study].",2021,"AIM: Evaluating the expression level of CD4(+) FoxP3(+) CD25(+) T cells and IL-6 in peripheral blood samples of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an emerging disease with worldwide distribution. However, there is a little data about the correlation between the disease and the host immune responses. METHODS: Whole blood samples of 30 COVID-19 patients and eight healthy people were collected during March to June 2020. Total RNA was extracted from the samples, cDNA synthesis was performed, and the expression level of targeted genes was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: The expression level of CD4, CD25, and Foxp3 was significantly downregulated 5-, 2-, and 3-fold, respectively, among COVID-19 patients in comparison to healthy controls (P-value < 0.0001). The expression level of IL-6 represented almost 18-fold increase in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated the expression profile analysis of CD4(+) FoxP3(+) CD25(+) T cells could be a potential marker for the assessment of severity of COVID-19 patients.","Mohebbi, Seyed Reza; Baghaei, Kaveh; Rostami-Nejad, Mohammad; Nazemalhosseini Mojarad, Ehsan; Mirjalali, Hamed; Yadegar, Abbas; Asri, Nastaran; Abdoulahi, Shahrokh; Assadzadeh Aghdaei, Hamid",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7682958/,550
186769,Changes in melanoma care practices during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multi-institutional cross-sectional survey.,2021-04-15,"We examined the synthesis and processing of the polymerase polyprotein in RNA(-) temperature sensitive mutant of murine coronavirus strain A59. These temperature sensitive mutants of MHV-A59 synthesize viral RNA at the permissive temperature (33.0 degrees C), but are unable to synthesize viral RNA at the nonpermissive temperature (39.5 degrees C). The ts mutants have been mapped to five different complementation groups in the polymerase gene. The 5'-most complementation groups, Groups A and B, map to a region encoding an autoproteinase responsible for the cleavage of p28, the amino-terminal product of the polymerase polyprotein. We screened six temperature sensitive mutants to determine if there was an alteration in the proteolytic processing of the polymerase polyprotein, particularly in the cleavage of the p28 protein. Two mutants, tsNC9 and tsLA16, had altered proteolytic products at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. One Group B temperature sensitive mutant, designated tsNC11, was defective in the production of p28 protein at the nonpermissive temperature. To further localize the site of the mutation in tsNC11, RNA representing the 5'-most 5.3 kb region of the polymerase gene was transfected into tsNC11-infected cells and virus production monitored. The transfected RNA was able to complement the defect in tsNC11, resulting in viral RNA synthesis and production of viral particles at the nonpermissive temperature. These results indicate that a gene product from the 5.3 kb region of gene 1 is required for coronavirus RNA synthesis.","Baker, S C; Gao, H; Baric, R S",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8209733/,550

192201,Diffuse muscle pain with quetiapine.,2003,"Among the pathways used by gram-negative bacteria for protein secretion, the autotransporter pathway represents a solution of impressive simplicity. Proteins are transported, independent of their nature as recombinant or native passengers, as long as the coding nucleotide sequence is inserted in frame between those of an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal domain, referred to as the beta-barrel of the outer membrane translocation unit. The immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) protease from Neisseria gonorrhoeae was the first identified member of the autotransporter family of secreted proteins. The IgA1 protease was employed in initial experiments investigating autotransporter-mediated surface display of recombinant proteins and to investigate structural and functional requirements. Various other autotransporter proteins have since been described, and the autodisplay system was developed on the basis of the natural Escherichia coli autotransporter protein AIDA-I (adhesin involved in diffuse adherence). Autodisplay has been used for the surface display of random peptide libraries to successfully screen for novel enzyme inhibitors. The autodisplay system was also used for the surface display of functional enzymes, including esterases, oxidoreductases, and electron transfer proteins. Whole E. coli cells displaying enzymes have been utilized to efficiently synthesize industrially important rare organic compounds with specific chirality. Autodisplay of epitopes on the surface of attenuated Salmonella carriers has also provided a novel way to induce immune protection after oral vaccination. This review summarizes the structural and functional features of the autodisplay system, illustrating its discovery and most recent applications. Autodisplay facilitates the export of more than 100,000 recombinant molecules per single cell and permits the oligomerization of subunits on the cell surface as well as the incorporation of inorganic prosthetic groups after transport of apoproteins onto the bacterial surface without disturbing bacterial integrity or viability. We discuss future biotechnical and biomedical applications in the light of these achievements.","Jose, Joachim; Meyer, Thomas F",Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18063719/,550

There are four major structural proteins in the SARS-CoV, including the nucleocapsid, spike, membrane, and small envelope proteins. In this study, two sets of truncated fragments of spike protein were generated, the first were approximately 210-bp nonoverlapping fragments and the second were overlapping segments of 750 to 900 bp. From these 23 fragments, we identified a fragment of 259 amino acids (amino acids 441 to 700) that is a major immunodominant epitope. This fragment was highly expressed, and the purified fragment C could detect all 33 SARS patient serum samples tested, collected from 7 to 60 days after the onset of fever, but had no reactivity with all 66 healthy human serum samples tested. Thus, fragment C of spike protein was identified as an immunodominant antigen and could be used for serological detection of SARS-CoV infection.","Lu, Liqun; Manopo, Ivanus; Leung, Bernard P; Chng, Hiok Hee; Ling, Ai Ee; Chee, Li Lian; Ooi, Eng Eong; Chan, Shzu-Wei; Kwang, Jimmy",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15071006/,550

An annual PPE is required by most state high school athletic associations for participation in school-based sports, although there is limited evidence to support its effectiveness for detecting conditions that predispose athletes to injury or illness. In 2019, the American Academy of Pediatrics, with representatives from the American Academy of Family Physicians and other organizations, published updated PPE recommendations (PPE5). According to the guideline, the general goals of the PPE are determining general physical and psychological health; evaluating for life-threatening or disabling conditions, including risk of sudden cardiac arrest and other conditions that may predispose the athlete to illness or injury; and serving as an entry point into the health care system for those without a medical home or primary care physician. The guideline recommends that the evaluation take place in the physician's office rather than in a group setting. The PPE should include a structured physical examination that focuses on the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems. Screening for depression, anxiety disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is also recommended. Clinicians should recognize any findings suggestive of the relative energy deficiency in sport syndrome. Additional consideration is required to address the needs and concerns of transgender athletes and athletes with physical and intellectual disabilities. Finally, guidelines have been published regarding return to play for athletes who have had COVID-19.","MacDonald, James; Schaefer, Marie; Stumph, Justin",American family physician,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33929170/,550
196257,The rising menace of scholarly black-market: Challenges and solutions for improving research in low- and middle-income countries.,2021-06-01,"Coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses that translate their genome RNA into polyproteins that are co- and posttranslationally processed into intermediate and mature replicase nonstructural proteins (nsps). In murine hepatitis virus (MHV), nsps 1, 2, and 3 are processed by two papain-like proteinase activities within nsp3 (PLP1 and PLP2) to yield nsp1, an nsp2-3 intermediate, and mature nsp2 and nsp3. To determine the role in replication of processing between nsp2 and nsp3 at cleavage site 2 (CS2) and PLP1 proteinase activity, mutations were engineered into the MHV genome at CS2, at CS1 and CS2, and at the PLP1 catalytic site, alone and in combination. Mutant viruses with abolished cleavage at CS2 were delayed in growth and RNA synthesis but grew to wild-type titers of >10(7) PFU/ml. Mutant viruses with deletion of both CS1 and CS2 exhibited both a delay in growth and a decrease in peak viral titer to approximately 10(4) PFU/ml. Inactivation of PLP1 catalytic residues resulted in a mutant virus that did not process at either CS1 or CS2 and was severely debilitated in growth, achieving only 10(2) PFU/ml. However, when both CS1 and CS2 were deleted in the presence of inactivated PLP1, the growth of the resulting mutant virus was partially compensated, comparable to that of the CS1 and CS2 deletion mutant. These results demonstrate that interactions of PLP1 with CS1 and CS2 are critical for protein processing and suggest that the interactions play specific roles in regulation of the functions of nsp1, 2, and 3 in viral RNA synthesis.","Graham, Rachel L; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16971428/,550
196413,The continuing story of dhat syndrome.,2004,"OBJECTIVES To investigate the epidemiology, diagnosis and prognosis of acute renal failure (ARF) in hospitalized Chinese during the last decade. METHODS The diagnosis of patients with ARF in Peking University Third Hospital from January 1994 to December 2003 was reconfirmed and the data of epidemiology, etiology and prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS Only 209 discharged cases were diagnosed with ARF and all were reconfirmed. Two peak occurrences were found at ages of 35-45 and 60-80 with a male predominance of approximately 59.7%. Patients diagnosed with ARF accounted for 1.19 per thousand of the admissions in the same period and increased significantly in the last 5 years (p = 0.038). The creatinine level at diagnosis was 345.8 +/- 122.6 micromol/l and had no significant change (p > 0.05). The percent of hospital-acquired ARF (HA-ARF) demonstrated a significant increase in 1999-2003 compared to 1994-1998 (p = 0.008). Intrarenal ARF accounted for 73.69% and was multifactorial, with drugs, infections and operations as leading causes. Renal biopsy was performed in 37.32% (78/209) with 53.84% (42/78) having acute interstitial nephritis. Maintenance dialysis was discontinued in 46.41% because their renal function completely or partially recovered. The overall mortality was 37.91% without improvement over time. The mortality was 6.25% for patients in nephrology department, but 65.51% in ICU (p < 0.001), and was 21.6% for patients in community-acquired ARF (CA-ARF), but 63.1% in HA-ARF (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS During the past 10 years, the number of patients diagnosed with ARF has been rising in hospitalized Chinese. HA-ARF was the major source, and infections, drugs and operations were the leading causes. The diagnosis and prognosis of acute renal failure did not improve much in this population over the decade studied.","Wang, Yue; Cui, Zhuan; Fan, Minhua",American journal of nephrology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16179778/,550
197718,Acceptance and Attitude toward COVID-19 Vaccination among the Public in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-sectional Study.,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a major new infectious disease of this century that is unique in its high morbidity and concentration in health care settings. We aimed to determine the level of psychological impact and coping styles among the medical staff in a primary health care setting. METHOD Using a structured questionnaire, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of the doctors and nurses working within a public, primary health care setting in mid-July 2003. The main outcome measures were rates of psychiatric morbidity, level of posttraumatic stress symptoms, and coping strategies. RESULTS The response rate was 92.0%. Of the 277 respondents (91 doctors and 186 nurses), psychiatric morbidity and posttraumatic morbidity were found in 20.6% and 9.4%, respectively. Both psychiatric and posttraumatic morbidities were associated with higher scores on coping efforts including self-distraction, behavioral disengagement, social support, venting, planning, and self-blame (all p <.001), but not with direct exposure factors such as contact with suspected SARS patients or working in fever rooms/tentages. Multivariate analysis showed that psychiatric morbidity was associated with post-traumatic morbidity (p =.02) and denial (p =.03), whereas posttraumatic morbidity was associated with younger age (p =.007), being married (p =.02), psychiatric morbidity (p =.02), self-distraction (p =.02), behavioral disengagement (p =.01), religion (p =.003), less venting (p =.04), less humor (p =.04), and less acceptance (p =.02). CONCLUSION SARS-related psychiatric and posttraumatic morbidities were present in the medical staff within a primary health care setting. Specific coping efforts, age, and marital status, not direct exposure factors, were associated with psychological morbidity. These findings provide possible foci for early identification and psychological support.","Sim, Kang; Chong, Phui Nah; Chan, Yiong Huak; Soon, Winnie Shok Wen",The Journal of clinical psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15323599/,550
199630,Who Is Caring for Health Care Workers' Families Amid COVID-19?,2021,"Two attractive features of ELISA are the specificity of antibody-antigen recognition and the sensitivity achieved by enzymatic amplification. This report describes the development of a non-enzymatic molecular recognition platform adaptable to point-of-care clinical settings and field detection of biohazardous materials. This filament-antibody recognition assay (FARA) is based on circumferential bands of antibody probes coupled to a 120 microm diameter polyester filament. One advantage of this design is that automated processing is achieved by sequential positioning of filament-coupled probes through a series of 25-60 microL liquid filled microcapillary chambers. This approach was evaluated by testing for the presence of M13KO7 bacterial virus using anti-M13KO7 IgG(1) monoclonal antibody coupled to a filament. Filament motion first positioned the antibodies within a microcapillary tube containing a solution of M13KO7 virus before moving the probes through subsequent chambers, where the filament-coupled probes were washed, exposed to a fluorescently labeled anti-M13K07 antibody, and washed again. Filament fluorescence was then measured using a flatbed microarray scanner. The presence of virus in solution produced a characteristic increase in filament fluorescence only in regions containing coupled antibody probes. Even without the enzymatic amplification of a typical ELISA, the presence of 8.3 x 10(8) virus particles produced a 30-fold increase in fluorescence over an immobilized negative control antibody. In an ELISA comparison study, the filament-based approach had a similar lower limit of sensitivity of approximately 1.7 x 10(7) virus particles. This platform may prove attractive for point-of-care settings, the detection of biohazardous materials, or other applications where sensitive, rapid, and automated molecular recognition is desired.","Stone, Gregory P; Mernaugh, Ray; Haselton, Frederick R",Biotechnology and bioengineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15895380/,550

Based on genetic similarities, coronaviruses are classified into three groups. Two group 2 coronaviruses, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), show remarkable antigenic and genetic similarities. In this study, we report the first complete genome sequence (30,738 nucleotides) of the prototype HCoV-OC43 strain (ATCC VR759). Complete genome and open reading frame (ORF) analyses were performed in comparison to the BCoV genome. In the region between the spike and membrane protein genes, a 290-nucleotide deletion is present, corresponding to the absence of BCoV ORFs ns4.9 and ns4.8. Nucleotide and amino acid similarity percentages were determined for the major HCoV-OC43 ORFs and for those of other group 2 coronaviruses. The highest degree of similarity is demonstrated between HCoV-OC43 and BCoV in all ORFs with the exception of the E gene. Molecular clock analysis of the spike gene sequences of BCoV and HCoV-OC43 suggests a relatively recent zoonotic transmission event and dates their most recent common ancestor to around 1890. An evolutionary rate in the order of 4 x 10(-4) nucleotide changes per site per year was estimated. This is the first animal-human zoonotic pair of coronaviruses that can be analyzed in order to gain insights into the processes of adaptation of a nonhuman coronavirus to a human host, which is important for understanding the interspecies transmission events that led to the origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak.","Vijgen, Leen; Keyaerts, Els; Moës, Elien; Thoelen, Inge; Wollants, Elke; Lemey, Philippe; Vandamme, Anne-Mieke; Van Ranst, Marc",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15650185/,550

201591,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among general Bangladeshi population: a cross-sectional study,2021,"Respiratory infections are prevalent in the elderly, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and utilization of health care services. Contributing to the increased incidence of infection with age is the well-described decline in immune response, which has been correlated with patterns of illness in the elderly. For example, there are higher morbidity and mortality from cancer, pneumonia, and post-operative complications in those who have diminished, delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test responses. Nutritional status is an important determinant of immune function. We have shown in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that vitamin E supplementation significantly improved immune response, including DTH and response to vaccines. Furthermore, subjects receiving vitamin E in the 6-month trial had a 30% lower incidence of infectious diseases. That study, however, was not powered to demonstrate statistical significance, and the infections were self-reported. To overcome these limitations, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of one-year supplementation with 200 IU/day vitamin E on the incidence and duration of respiratory infections in 617 elderly nursing home residents. The results of this clinical trial show that vitamin E supplementation significantly reduces the incidence rate of common colds and the number of subjects who acquire a cold among elderly nursing home residents. A nonsignificant reduction in the duration of colds was also observed. Because of the high rate and more severe morbidity associated with common colds in this age group, these findings have important implications for the well being of the elderly as well as for the economic burden associated with their care.","Meydani, Simin Nikbin; Han, Sung Nim; Hamer, Davidson H",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15753147/,550

METHODS: This was a multi-center and cross-sectional observational study. The study population included 1788 STEMI patients from 15 centers in Turkey. The patients were divided into two groups: COVID-19 era (March 11st-May 15st, 2020; n = 733) or pre- COVID-19 era group (March 11st-May 15st, 2019; n = 1055). Also, the patients in COVID-19 era were grouped as COVID-19 positive (n = 65) or negative (n = 668). RESULTS: There was a 30.5% drop in STEMI admission during COVID-19 era in comparison to pre-COVID-19 era. The patients admitted to the medical centers during COVID-19 era had a longer symptom-to-first medical contact time [120 (75-240) vs. 100 (60-180) minutes, p < 0.001]. COVID-19 positive STEMI patients had higher thrombus grade and lower left ventricular ejection fraction compared to COVID-19 negative patients. COVID-19 positive patients had higher mortality (28% vs. 6%, p < 0.001) and cardiogenic shock (20% vs. 7%, p < 0.001) rates compared with those without COVID-19. Matching based on propensity scores showed higher mortality and high thrombus grade in STEMI patients who were infected by SARS-COV-2 (each p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We detected significantly lower STEMI hospitalization rates and significant delay in duration of symptom onset to first medical contact in the context of Turkey during the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, high thrombus grade and mortality were more common in COVID-19 positive STEMI patients.","Kiris, Tuncay; Avci, Eyüp; Ekin, Tuba; Akgün, Didar Elif; Tiryaki, Mücahit; Yidirim, Arafat; Hazir, Kutluhan; Murat, Bektas; Yeni, Mehtap; Altindag, Rojhad; Gül, Sefa; Arik, Baran; Güzel, Tuncay; Murat, Selda; Oz, Ahmet; Karabacak, Mustafa; Aktas, Zihni; Yildirim, Tarik; Kilicaslan, Baris; Ergene, Asim Oktay",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,550

207885,"Analysis of a SARS-CoV-2 daily screening programme for healthcare workers at a district hospital in KwaZulu-Natal, a quality improvement initiative. (Special Collection: COVID-19.)",2020,"AIMS: To systematically review the currently available evidence investigating the association between olfactory dysfunction (OD) and the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). To analyse the prevalence of OD in patients who have tested positive on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for COVID-19. To perform a meta-analysis of patients presenting with olfactory dysfunction, during the pandemic, and to investigate the positive predictive value for a COVID-19-positive result in this population. To assess whether olfactory dysfunction could be used as a diagnostic marker for COVID-19 positivity and aid public health approaches in tackling the current outbreak. METHODS: We systematically searched MedLine (PubMed), Embase, Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC), Medrxiv, the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, NIHR Dissemination centre, Clinical Evidence, National Health Service Evidence and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence to identify the current published evidence which associates coronaviridae or similar RNA viruses with anosmia. The initial search identified 157 articles. A total of 145 papers were excluded following application of our exclusion criteria. The 12 remaining articles that presented evidence on the association between COVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction were critically analysed. RESULTS: Olfactory dysfunction has been shown to be the strongest predictor of COVID-19 positivity when compared to other symptoms in logistic regression analysis. In patients who had tested positive for COVID-19, there was a prevalence of 62% of OD. In populations of patients who are currently reporting OD, there is a positive predictive value of 61% for a positive COVID-19 result. CONCLUSION: Our review has shown that there is already significant evidence which demonstrates an association between OD and the novel coronavirus-COVID-19. It is unclear if this finding is unique to this coronavirus as individual viral phenotypes rarely present in such concentrated large numbers. We have demonstrated that OD is comparatively more predictive for COVID-19 positivity compared to other associated symptoms. We recommend that people who develop OD during the pandemic should be self-isolate and this guidance should be adopted internationally to prevent transmission.","Rocke, John; Hopkins, Claire; Philpott, Carl; Kumar, Nirmal",Clin. otolaryngol,,550
208098,"Nursing work intention, stress, and professionalism in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran: A cross-sectional study",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic is marked by a wide range of clinical disease courses, ranging from asymptomatic to deadly. There have been many studies seeking to explore the correlations between COVID-19 clinical outcomes and various clinical variables, including age, sex, race, underlying medical problems, and social habits. In particular, the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 outcome is controversial, with multiple conflicting reports in the current literature. In this study, we aim to analyze how smoking may affect the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. We analyzed sequencing data from lung and oral epithelial samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found that the receptor and transmembrane protease necessary for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively, were upregulated in smoking samples from both lung and oral epithelial tissue. We then explored the mechanistic hypothesis that smoking may upregulate ACE2 expression through the upregulation of the androgen pathway. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 upregulation were both correlated to androgen pathway enrichment and the specific upregulation of central pathway regulatory genes. These data provide a potential model for the increased susceptibility of smoking patients to COVID-19 and encourage further exploration into the androgen and tobacco upregulation of ACE2 to understand the potential clinical ramifications.","Chakladar, Jaideep; Shende, Neil; Li, Wei Tse; Rajasekaran, Mahadevan; Chang, Eric Y; Ongkeko, Weg M",,,550

209574,Severe Staffing And Personal Protective Equipment Shortages Faced By Nursing Homes During The COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is now a global pandemic. Emerging results indicate a dysregulated immune response. Given the role of CCR5 in immune cell migration and inflammation, we investigated the impact of CCR5 blockade via the CCR5-specific antibody leronlimab on clinical, immunological and virological parameters in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. METHODS: In March 2020, ten terminally-ill, critical COVID-19 patients received two doses of leronlimab via individual emergency use indication (EIND). We analyzed changes in clinical presentation, immune cell populations, inflammation as well as SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia before and 14 days after treatment. RESULTS: Over the 14 day study period 6/10 patients survived, 2 extubated, and 1 patient was discharged. We observed complete CCR5 receptor occupancy in all donors by day 7. Compared to baseline, we observed a concomitant statistically significant reduction of plasma IL-6, restoration of the CD4/CD8 ratio, and resolution of SARS-CoV2 plasma viremia (pVL) compared to controls. Further, the increase in CD8% was inversely correlated with reduction in pVL (r = -0.77, p = 0.0013). CONCLUSIONS: While the current study design precludes clinical efficacy inferences, these results implicate CCR5 as a therapeutic target for COVID-19 and form the basis for ongoing randomized clinical trials.","Patterson, Bruce K; Seethamraju, Harish; Dhody, Kush; Corley, Michael J; Kazempour, Kazem; Lalezari, Jay; Pang, Alina P S; Sugai, Christopher; Mahyari, Eisa; Francisco, Edgar B; Pise, Amruta; Rodrigues, Hallison; Wu, Helen L; Webb, Gabriela M; Park, Byung S; Kelly, Scott; Pourhassan, Nader; Lelic, Alina; Kdouh, Lama; Herrera, Monica; Hall, Eric; Bimber, Benjamin N; Plassmeyer, Matthew; Gupta, Raavi; Alpan, Oral; O039,; Halloran, Jane A; Mudd, Philip A; Akalin, Enver; Ndhlovu, Lishomwa C; Sacha, Jonah B",Int J Infect Dis,,550

A descriptive analysis was adopted for the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases,including time,spatial and population distribution,severity of symptoms, and exposure history. @*Results @#Totally 1 284 cases were reported,of which 1 176 were confirmed cases (91.59%) and 108 were asymptomatic cases (8.41%). The first confirmed case was reported on January 21. The curve of the disease onset peaked from January 22 to 29, with 87 cases as the biggest number a day. The curve of the disease reported peaked from January 28 to 30, with 130 cases as the biggest number a day. Then the number of the cases showed a declining trend. By February 4, totally 79 counties (cities, districts) had confirmed cases, covering 87.78% of Zhejiang Province, and it has not increase since then. A male to female ratio of 1.02∶1 was reported among 1 284 cases,1 021 were 30-69 years old (79.52%) and 339 (26.40%) were business service providers. There were 11 health workers reported to be infected,but not by occupational exposure. Among the confirmed cases, 1 010 (85.88%) were clinically mild cases. One case died. Before January 23, the cases were mainly imported from Hubei Province, local cases were predominant by the end of January. @*Conclusions @#The COVID-19 epidemic has spread widely in Zhejiang Province and people are generally susceptible. Most cases were clinically mild, and were aged 30-69 years. No health workers infected were due to occupational exposure. The incidence of COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province has turned into a lower level,suggesting that the early prevention and control measures have achieved initial results. With people returning from holiday, precise prevention and control should be put into effect.","LIN, Junfen; Mengna, WU; Haocheng, WU; ZHANG, Tao; Chen, WU; Fudong, LI",Journal of Preventive Medicine,,550
224126,What is the best timing for health care workers infected with COVID-19 to return to work?,2020,"The CCR7 chemokine axis, is comprised of chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21) and chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19) acting on chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7). This axis plays two important but apparently opposing roles in cancer. On the one hand, this axis is significantly engaged in the trafficking of a number of effecter cells involved in mounting an immune response to a growing tumour. This suggests therapeutic strategies which involve potentiation of this axis can be used to combat the spread of cancer. On the other hand, the CCR7 axis plays a significant role in controlling the migration of tumour cells towards the lymphatic system and metastasis and can thus contribute to the expansion of cancer. This implies that therapeutic strategies which involve decreasing signaling through the CCR7 axis would have a beneficial effect in preventing dissemination of cancer. This dichotomy has partly been the reason why this axis has not yet been exploited, as other chemokine axes have, as a therapeutic target in cancer. Recent report of a crystal structure for CCR7 provides opportunities to exploit this axis in developing new cancer therapies. However, it remains unclear which of these two strategies, potentiation or antagonism of the CCR7 axis, is more appropriate for cancer therapy. This review brings together the evidence supporting both roles of the CCR7 axis in cancer and examines the future potential of each of the two different therapeutic approaches involving the CCR7 axis in cancer.","Salem, Anwar; Alotaibi, Mashael; Mroueh, Rima; Basheer, Haneen A; Afarinkia, Kamyar",Biochim Biophys Acta Rev Cancer,,550

We explored ways to deal with the coronavirus stressor and psychological outcomes among physicians and nurses. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 124 healthcare workers in General Hospital Nasice (Croatia) were invited to participate in a study by performing within the period of March 26 to April 6 2020 questionnaire collected information on socio-demographic characteristics and living conditions that may be risk factors for covid-19 concern, Short form health survey-36, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WOC; consisting of 8 subscales: Confrontive Coping, Distancing, Self-Controlling, Seeking Social Support, Accepting Responsibility, Escape-Avoidance, Planful Problem Solving, Positive Reappraisal). RESULTS: 11% healthworkers reports moderate to very-severe depression, 17% moderate to extremely-severe anxiety and 10% for moderate to extremely-severe stress. 67% of medical staff are worried. No statistically significant differences in the scales of depression, anxiety, and stress were found between nurses and physicians, but differences were found on Escape-Avoidance and Positive Reappraisal subscales. Nurses use significantly more avoiding coping style and positive reappraisal than doctors. Seeking social support is more pronounced in those over 40 years old, while those under 40 use more avoidable stress management techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring and ensuring the mental health of coronavirus care staff is crucial for global health.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This institutional review board-approved retrospective study included 240 cases with a mean age of 47.6 ± 15.9 years, ranging from 20 to 90 years, who had a chest CT and RT-PCR performed. Computed tomography images were independently analyzed by 2 thoracic radiologists to identify patterns defined by the RSNA-STR-ACR consensus statement, and concordance was determined with weighted &#954; tests. Also, CT findings and CT severity scores were tabulated and compared. RESULTS: Of the 240 cases, 118 had findings on CT. The most frequent on the RT-PCR-positive group were areas of ground-glass opacities (80.5%), crazy-paving pattern (32.2%), and rounded pseudonodular ground-glass opacities (22.9%). Regarding the CT patterns, the most frequent in the RT-PCR-positive group was typical in 75.9%, followed by negative in 17.1%. The interreader agreement was 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.80-0.96) in this group. The CT severity score had a mean difference of -0.07 (95% confidence interval, -0.48 to 0.34) among the readers, showing no significant differences regarding visual estimation. CONCLUSIONS: The RSNA-STR-ACR consensus statement on reporting chest CT patterns for COVID-19 presents a high interreader agreement, with the typical pattern being more frequently associated with RT-PCR-positive examinations.","Silva, Claudio F; Alegria, Julia; Ramos, Cristobal; Verdugo, Jaime; Diaz, Juan-Carlos; Varela, Cristian; Barbe, Mario",J. comput. assist. tomography,,550
226686,A Thoughtful Rebirth of Health Care: Lessons From the Pandemic,2021,"The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 has led to profound public health crisis. In particular, individuals with preexisting conditions of heart disease, diabetes, cerebrovascular diseases and the elderly are most vulnerable to succumb to this infection. The current COVID-19 emergency calls for rapid development of potential prevention and management strategies against this virus-mediated disease. There is a plethora of evidence that supports the add-on benefits of yoga in stress management, as well as prevention and management of chronic noncommunicable diseases. There are some studies on the effect of yoga in communicable diseases as well but very few for acute conditions and almost none for the rapidly spreading infections resulting in pandemics. Based on the available scientific evidences on yoga in improving respiratory and immune functions, we have formulated very simple doable integrated yoga modules in the form of videos to be practiced for prevention of the disease by children, adults, and the elderly.","Nagarathna, R.; Nagendra, H.

The identified infective agent is a novel corona virus called ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2) and the respiratory disease caused by this agent aquired the name ""coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19). In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. We reviewed the international literature regarding the novel coronavirus outbreak. Here below, we focus mainly on the diagnostic issues of COVID-19 and on the estimation of the prognosis. We detail the relevant anamnestic factors and initial examination results which serve as basics for the clinical suspicion of COVID-19. We also focus on the proper method of microbiological sampling and the relevant informations regarding diagnostic tests like the gold standard real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. We also cite the current national epidemiologic regulations of testing for novel coronavirus. In the last section, we emphasize the importance and the potential way of early identification of high-risk patients. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause substantial epidemiological and healthcare burden even in Hungary. In addition to the epidemiologic interventions aiming the deceleration of the outbreak, the early identification and the correct hospital treatment remain key issues since these may influence mortality. The chances of the critically ill patients could be improved solely by a high-quality and careful critical care.

However, the transition from the quarantined period to the new normal lifestyle amidst the pandemic in Malaysia might have altered the way mattering predicts happiness. Some studies have reported that students tend to feel less socially supported during online studies, and not every one of them showed high optimism or the belief that a better situation will come soon. We hypothesized that in the new normal, the association between mattering and happiness is fully mediated by perceived social support and optimism. In order to test the hypothesis, 400 university students between 18 to 30 years of age were recruited to respond to the Satisfaction with Life Scale, Revised life orientation test, mattering to others questionnaire, and multidimensional scale of perceived social support. Analyses with Bootstrap method with 5,000 sampling and 95% confidence interval using PROCESS Macro Model 4 yielded results, which suggested that mattering is still a robust predictor of happiness and that both perceived social support and optimism only partially mediated the association.

We evaluate herein the feasibility of expanding virus-specific T cells (VST) against SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo through a standard protocol proven effective for other viruses. The experiment was performed in three different donors' scenarios: (a) SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infection/negative serology, (b) SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic infection/positive serology, and (c) no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection/negative serology. We were able to obtain an expanded VST product from donors 1 and 2 (1.6x and 1.8x increase of baseline VST count, respectively) consisting in CD3 + cells (80.3% and 62.7%, respectively) with CD4 + dominance (60% in both donors). Higher numbers of VST were obtained from the donor 2 as compared to donor 1. T-cell clonality test showed oligoclonal reproducible peaks on a polyclonal background for both donors. In contrast, VST could be neither expanded nor primed in a donor without evidence of prior infection. This proof-of-concept study supports the feasibility of expanding ex vivo SARS-CoV-2-specific VST from blood of convalescent donors. The results raise the question of whether the selection of seropositive donors may be a strategy to obtain cell lines enriched in their SARS-CoV-2-specificity for future adoptive transfer to immunosuppressed patients.","Guerreiro, Manuel; Aguilar-Gallardo, Cristóbal; Montoro, Juan; Francés-Gómez, Clara; Latorre, Víctor; Luna, Irene; Planelles, Dolores; Carrasco, María Paz; Gómez, María Dolores; González-Barberá, Eva María; Aguado, Cristina; Sempere, Amparo; Solves, Pilar; Gómez-Seguí, Inés; Balaguer-Rosello, Aitana; Louro, Alberto; Perla, Aurora; Larrea, Luis; Sanz, Jaime; Arbona, Cristina; de la Rubia, Javier; Geller, Ron; Sanz, Miguel Ángel; Sanz, Guillermo; Luis Piñana, José",Transpl Infect Dis,,550

The presence of HLH was described in severely ill patients during the H1N1 influenza epidemic, presenting with pulmonary vascular thrombosis. We tested the hypothesis that genes causing primary HLH regulate pathways linking pulmonary thromboembolism to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using novel network-informed computational algorithms. This approach led to the identification of Neutrophils Extracellular Traps (NETs) as plausible mediators of vascular thrombosis in severe COVID-19 in children and adults. Taken together, the network-informed analysis led us to propose the following model: the release of NETs in response to inflammatory signals acting in concert with SARS-CoV-2 damage the endothelium and direct platelet-activation promoting abnormal coagulation leading to serious complications of COVID-19. The underlying hypothesis is that genetic and/or environmental conditions that favor the release of NETs may predispose individuals to thrombotic complications of COVID-19 due to an increase risk of abnormal coagulation. This would be a common pathogenic mechanism in conditions including autoimmune/infectious diseases, hematologic and metabolic disorders.","Ding, Jun; Hostallero, David Earl; El Khili, Mohamed Reda; Fonseca, Gregory Joseph; Milette, Simon; Noorah, Nuzha; Guay-Belzile, Myriam; Spicer, Jonathan; Daneshtalab, Noriko; Sirois, Martin; Tremblay, Karine; Emad, Amin; Rousseau, Simon",PLoS Comput Biol,,550

Paradoxically, the need for health professionals has increased. Online methods are being widely used, but its efficacy is rarely measured. Objectives: This study was conducted to find the efficacy of an online course in developing competency among medical students to prescribe balanced diet. Methods: An online module was hosted at https://drzinia.moodlecloud.com/. A noninferiority trial was conducted among voluntary participants of the third MBBS students, in 2019. Stratified block randomization was done, so that ten students were allocated to the intervention arm of online sessions and ten students were allocated to the control arm of classroom sessions. Pretest assessments, seven assessments related to sessions conducted, and a postassessment were done. Generalized estimating equations were done to adjust for the effects of other confounders and see whether the intervention was a significant determinant of ability to prescribe balanced diet. Results: Baseline variables were comparable in the two groups. The pretest scores were not significantly different in the two groups. The mean total marks scored by the online group (47.33/70) was not significantly different (t=0.68; p=0.50) from that of the class room group (45.70/70). The posttest scores were significantly higher than the pretest scores. Ninety-percent of students in the online course agreed that they could effectively learn through an online course. Conclusion: Online teaching is effective to learn the prescription of balanced diet.

232729,Spatial-Temporal Relationship Between Population Mobility and COVID-19 Outbreaks in South Carolina: Time Series Forecasting Analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Parents bereaved by suicide often say the death of their loved one happened ""out of the blue"". It is common for suicide in young people to be preceded by a number of indications of risk, including self-harm, the communication of suicidal ideas, and recent contact with services. We examined whether there is a group of young people who die by suicide without explicit warning signs, and if they indicate risk indirectly, through other suicide risk factors. METHODS: Using national mortality data, we identified a three-year UK national case series of deaths by suicide in people aged 10-19. We extracted information on the antecedents of suicide from coroner inquests and other official investigations into these deaths. RESULTS: There were 595 suicides by young people between 2014 and 2016. We obtained data for 544 (91%). Around a third (n = 161, 30%) had no known history of suicidal ideas or self-harm. This group also had low rates of other risk factors for suicide, including substance misuse, a mental health diagnosis, recent adverse life events, and of contact with services. LIMITATIONS: We relied on information provided to inquests and other investigations: under-reporting, especially on sensitive issues, is likely. Families and other witnesses may have under-reported warning signs that suggest they could have intervened. CONCLUSION: Suicide after minimal warning appears to be relatively common in young people. Suicidal ideas may develop rapidly in this age group and crisis services should therefore be widely available. Future prevention cannot rely on explicit expressions of risk.","Rodway, Cathryn; Tham, Su-Gwan; Turnbull, Pauline; Kapur, Nav; Appleby, Louis",J Affect Disord,,550

The first Bio-behavioral Surveillance (BBS) surveys, with population size estimation activities, were conducted in Mozambique in 2010-2014. METHODS: We used multiple methods - sequential sampling, unique object, unique event and service multipliers - to estimate the numbers of men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSW) and people who inject drugs (PWID) living in major cities in Mozambique. Results were applied to census population sizes to estimate the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) and those unaware of their status. RESULTS: Our results suggest that Maputo has 5,182 MSM, which constitutes 1.0% of the adult male population (plausibility bounds: 0.5-2.6%), Beira 1,796 (1.4%, 1.0%-2.2%), and Nampula 874 (0.6%, 0.4%-1.6%). The population of FSW numbered 1,514 (0.6%, plausibility bounds: 0.4%- 1.6% of adult female city population) in Maputo, 2,616 (2.2%, 1.3%-6.0%) in Beira, and 2,052 (1.4%, 0.8%-5.9%) in Nampula. PWID numbered 2,518 (0.4%, plausibility bounds: 0.3%-0.5% of adult male city population) in Maputo and 1,982 (1.2%, 0.6%-1.9%) in Nampula. PLHIV ranged from 25-497 MSM, 382-664 FSW and 712-1340 PWID, while PLHIV unaware of their HIV positive serostatus, ranged from 24-486 MSM, 327-552 FSW and 265-468 PWID. CONCLUSION: Although estimates generally fell within the range of those from the literature, the triangulation of survey and programmatic data over time will increasingly refine population size estimates and support the optimal allocation of limited resources.","Sathane, Isabel; Boothe, Makini A S; Horth, Roberta; Baltazar, Cynthia Semá; Chicuecue, Noela; Seleme, Jessica; Raymond, Henry F",Sex. transm. dis,,550

The studies with and without face shield in both an infected and healthy person have been considered in indoor environment simulation. In addition to the influence of the face shield and the synchronization of the breathing process while using the device, we also simulated the effect of small air movements on the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate (outdoor environment simulation). The contact with infectious particles in the case without a face shield was 12-20 s (s), in the presence of at least one person who was positive for SARS-CoV-2. If the infected person wore a face shield, no contact with contaminated air was observed during the entire simulation time (80 s). The time of contact with contaminated air (infection time) decreases to about 11 s when the surrounding air is still and begins to move at a low speed. Qualitative differences between simulations performed on the patients with and without the face shield are clearly visible. The maximum prevention of contagion is probably a consequence of wearing a face shield by an infected person. Our results suggest that it is possible to determine contact with air contaminated by SARS-CoV-2 using the CFD method under realistic conditions for virtually any situation and configuration. The proposed method is probably the fastest and most reliable among those based on CFD-based techniques.","Tretiakow, Dmitry; Tesch, Krzysztof; Skorek, Andrzej",Environ Res,,550

In this study, we aim to identify the spatiotemporal heterogeneities in the relationship between human mobility flows and COVID-19 cases in U.S. counties. Using anonymous mobile device location data, we compute an aggregate measure of mobility that includes flows within and into each county. We then compare the trends in human mobility and COVID-19 cases of each county using dynamic time warping (DTW). DTW results highlight the time periods and locations (counties) where mobility may have influenced disease transmission. Also, the correlation between human mobility and infections varies substantially across geographic space and time in terms of relationship, strength, and similarity.","Kwon, Hoeyun; Hom, Kaitlyn; Rifkin, Mark; Tian, Beichen; Koylu, Caglar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13765v1.pdf,550

The quarantine period during corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak might affect the quality of life leading thousands of individuals to diminish the daily caloric expenditure and mobility, leading to a sedentary behavior and increase the number of health disorders. Exercising is used as a non-pharmacological treatment in many chronic diseases. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of physical exercise in COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. We also point links between exercise, mental, and cardiovascular health. The infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 affects host cells binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. If there is not enough oxygen supply the lungs and other tissues, such as the heart or brain, are affected. SARS-CoV-2 enhances ACE2 leading to inflammation and neuronal death with possible development of mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Physical exercise also enhances the ACE2 expression. Conversely, the activation of ACE2/Ang 1-7/Mas axis by physical exercise induces an antiinflammatory and antifibrotic effect. Physical exercise has beneficial effects on mental health enhancing IGF-1, PI3K, BDNF, ERK, and reducing GSK3ß levels. In addition, physical exercise enhances the activity of PGC-1&#945;/ FNDC5/Irisin pathway leading to neuronal survival and the maintenance of a good mental health. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to elevation of ACE2 levels through pathological mechanisms that lead to neurological and cardiovascular complications, while the physiological response of ACE2 to physical exercise improves cardiovascular and mental health.","De Sousa, Ricardo Augusto Leoni; Improta-Caria, Alex Cleber; Aras-Júnior, Roque; de Oliveira, Edilamar Menezes; Soci, Úrsula Paula Reno; Cassilhas, Ricardo Cardoso",Neurol. sci,,550

Currently, no mass-market wrist-worn SpO2 monitor meets the medical standards for pulse oximeters. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this monocentric and prospective clinical study with single-blind analysis was to test and validate the accuracy of the reflective pulse oximeter function of the Withings ScanWatch to measure SpO2 levels at different stages of hypoxia. The secondary objective was to confirm the safety of this device when used as intended. METHODS: To achieve these objectives, we included 14 healthy participants aged 23-39 years in the study, and we induced several stable plateaus of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) ranging from 100%-70% to mimic nonhypoxic conditions and then mild, moderate, and severe hypoxic conditions. We measured the SpO2 level with a Withings ScanWatch on each participant's wrist and the SaO2 from blood samples with a co-oximeter, the ABL90 hemoximeter (Radiometer Medical ApS). RESULTS: After removal of the inconclusive measurements, we obtained 275 and 244 conclusive measurements with the two ScanWatches on the participants' right and left wrists, respectively, evenly distributed among the 3 predetermined SpO2 groups: SpO2&#8804;80%, 80%<SpO2&#8804;90%, and 90%<SpO2. We found a strong association and a high level of agreement between the measurements collected from the devices, with high Pearson correlation coefficients of r=0.944 and r=0.954 on the correlation plots, low Pearson correlation coefficients of r=0.083 (P=.17) and r=0.23 (P=.001) on Bland-Altman plots, biases of 0.98% (95% CI 0.65-1.32) and 1.56% (95% CI 1.24-1.87), and root mean square errors of 2.97% and 3.00% from the participants' right and left hands, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the Withings ScanWatch is able to measure SpO2 levels with adequate accuracy at a clinical grade. No undesirable effects or adverse events were reported during the study.

242551,The Implementation of Online Hospitals in China: Study of Influencing Factors of Mobile Medical Services' Adoption,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the ability of four models of behaviour, namely, Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), the Common Sense Self-Regulation Model (CS-SRM), and Social Cognitive Theory and the Reasoned Action Approach (SCT and RAA) to understand adherence to transmission-reducing behaviours (TRBs) advised by national governments for suppression of SARS-CoV2. DESIGN: A series of six cross-sectional telephone surveys of a random representative sample of adults living in Scotland. METHODS: Self-reported adherence to three TRBs (physical distancing, wearing a face covering and handwashing), PMT, CS-SRM, and SCT/RAA constructs, and sociodemographic variables were measured each week for 6 weeks (n = ~500 p/w; third June-15th July) via a 15 min telephone survey. RESULTS: Adherence was high ('Always' or 'Most times') throughout for physical distancing and handwashing, and, when mandated, for wearing a face covering. Older people were more adherent to all TRBs. Constructs from all three models predicted all three TRBs. Intention and self-efficacy (SCT/RAA) were the only beliefs to predict to all three TRBs each week and for all groups equally; intention was the strongest predictor. The predictive utility of PMT and CS-SRM varied by TRB and by group. Of note was the observation that several illness beliefs were associated with adherence only for those who believed they had not had COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The CHARIS project has identified beliefs about specific behaviours, the illness and the risks associated with lower adherence rates that might be addressed in national interventions. It confirms previous findings that some groups show lower levels of adherence and might be specially targeted.","Dixon, Diane; Den Daas, Chantal; Hubbard, Gill; Johnston, Marie",Br. j. health psychol,,550
243516,COVID-19 Pandemic: Is This a Good Time for Implementation of Home Programs for Children's Rehabilitation in Low- and Middle-Income Countries?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the global community in many ways. Combating the COVID-19 pandemic requires a coordinated effort through engaging public and service providers in preventive measures. The government of Ethiopia had already announced prevention guidelines for the public. However, there is a scarcity of evidence-based data on the public knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) and response of the service providers regarding COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the public KAP and service providers' preparedness towards the pandemic in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from late March to the first week of April 2020. Participants were conveniently sampled from 10 different city sites. Data collection was performed using a self-administered questionnaire and observational assessment using a checklist. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version Descriptive statistics, correlation coefficient and chi-square tests were performed. RESULT: A total of 839 public participants and 420 service providers enrolled in the study. The mean age was 30.30 (range = 18-72) years. The majority of the respondents (58.6%) had moderate knowledge about COVID-19, whereas 37.2% had good knowledge. Moreover, 60.7% and 59.8% of the participants had a positive attitude towards preventive measures and good practice to mitigate the pandemic, respectively. There was a moderate positive correlation between knowledge and attitude, whereas the correlations between knowledge and practice and attitude and practice were weak. With regard to service providers' preparedness, 70% have made hand-washing facilities available. A large majority of the respondents (84.4%) were using government-owned media followed by social media (46.0%) as a main source of information. CONCLUSION: The public in Addis Ababa had moderate knowledge, an optimistic attitude and descent practice. The information flow from government and social media seemed successful seeing the majority of the respondents identifying preventive measures, signs and symptoms and transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. Knowledge and attitude was not associated with practice, thus, additional innovative strategies for practice changes are needed. Two thirds of the service provider made available hand washing facilities which seems a first positive step. However, periodic evaluation of the public KAP and assessment of service providers' preparedness is mandatory to combat the pandemic effectively.","Desalegn, Zelalem; Deyessa, Negussie; Teka, Brhanu; Shiferaw, Welelta; Hailemariam, Damen; Addissie, Adamu; Abagero, Abdulnasir; Kaba, Mirgissa; Abebe, Workeabeba; Nega, Berhanu; Ayele, Wondimu; Haile, Tewodros; Gebrehiwot, Yirgu; Amogne, Wondwossen; Kantelhardt, Eva Johanna; Abebe, Tamrat",PLoS One,,550

However, the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic has necessitated the implementation of Home-based Learning (HBL) for educators, parents, and students on an unprecedented duration and scale. The notions and the factors associated with the implementation of HBL are yet fully investigated. As such, this study aims to shed light on the prerequisites needed for implementing HBL and suggest its future research direction. The methodology involves a systematic review of the existing studies on ICT-supported formal learning outside the classroom and to identify the prerequisites of HBL from various perspectives of the students, teachers, and parents. By doing so, this report will provide a deeper understanding of the multiple components of HBL and how it is to be taken into consideration when implementing HBL from both the theoretical and practical standpoint.","Wen, Yun; Gwendoline, Choon Lang Quek; Lau, Sin Yee",TechTrends,,550
246396,When the Big Shots Deviate: On the KAP of Religious Clerics Regarding Prevention of COVID-19 [Letter],2020,"PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic recovery will require a broad and coordinated effort for infection testing, immunity determination, and vaccination. With the advent of several COVID-19 vaccines, the dissemination and delivery of COVID-19 immunization across the nation is of concern. Previous immunization delivery patterns may reveal important components of a comprehensive and sustainable effort to immunize everyone in the nation. METHODS: The delivery of vaccinations were enumerated by provider type using 2017 Medicare Part B Fee-For-Service data and the 2013-2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The delivery of these services was examined at the service, physician, and visit level. RESULTS: In 2017 Medicare Part B Fee-For-Service, primary care physicians provided the largest share of services for vaccinations (46%), followed closely by mass immunizers (45%), then nurse practitioners/physician assistants (NP/PAs) (5%). The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey showed that primary care physicians provided most clinical visits for vaccination (54% of all visits). CONCLUSIONS: Primary care physicians have played a crucial role in delivery of vaccinations to the US population, including the elderly, between 2012-2017. These findings indicate primary care practices may be a crucial element of vaccine counseling and delivery in the upcoming COVID-19 recovery and immunization efforts in the United States.","Wilkinson, Elizabeth; Jetty, Anuradha; Petterson, Stephen; Jabbarpour, Yalda; Westfall, John M",Ann. fam. med,,550

247237,Use of Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Scoping Review,2020,"Background: It is widely known that timely percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is superior to fibrinolysis in patients with ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) However, fibrinolytic therapy is still widely used in Malaysia due to factors such as lack of PCI-capable hospitals, logistics, and financial issues Unfortunately, there are patients who fail to achieve reperfusion after thrombolysis and hence PCI still plays a crucial role and can be life-saving for such patients Vascular access is then a major concern as femoral access potentially carries higher bleeding risk which in turn leads to increased mortality Therefore, radial approach has been advocated due to lower risk of bleeding events, ease of access and reduced hospital length of stay This study aims to look at the trend of usage, compare characteristics, safety, and clinical outcomes of radial versus femoral access in this group of patients Methods: This is an observational retrospective analysis 498 patients with acute STEMI that underwent rescue PCI in the National Heart Institute from January 2007 till December 2016 were included in the study These patients were referred from other hospitals due to failed thrombolysis Patients’ demographics, risk factors, and procedural characteristics were evaluated The yearly trend of radial versus femoral access was analyzed Comparison of outcomes between radial and femoral approach was done categorically on in-hospital mortality rate, MACE rate (Death, reinfarction, urgent CABG, Stroke) at 30-day, 6-month, and 1-year follow up Results: Femoral access was used in 296 patients whereas radial access was used in 202 patients Notably, femoral access was used more frequently in patients above 50 years old In terms of gender, predominantly male (90 6% for radial and 85 8% for femoral) A pattern was seen whereby operators were more in favor of femoral access from 2007 till 2014 but subsequently switched to predominantly radial access from 2015 onwards This change was due to an increasing trend of usage for radial approach with concurrent decreasing trend for femoral approach throughout the past decade Femoral approach was seen significantly more in patients with history of previous myocardial infarction and heart failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD), Killip II onwards and associated with higher IABP usage Analysis showed that radial approach was associated with lower in-hospital mortality compared to femoral approach (3% Vs 13 2%, p≤0 001) However, there were no significant differences in terms of bleeding outcomes, length of stay, 30-day, 6-month, and 1-year mortality between both approaches Femoral access also did not significantly increase MACE within 1 year compared to radial access in STEMI patients who underwent rescue PCI (Hazard Ratio: 1 9;95% Confidence Interval, 0 8-4 5;p = 0 164) [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Conclusion: The usage trend over the past decade seems likely due to the landmark studies for benefits of radial over femoral access, improving skills and experience of operators From this study, we can then infer that radial approach confers more favorable outcome in terms of in-hospital mortality It is likely that the femoral approach was used in group of patients which were more ill at presentation and had more co-morbidities Otherwise, the results in this study were somewhat similar with the recent SAFARI-STEMI study whereby there were no significant differences between the MACE outcome and bleeding events In this new era with the Covid-19 pandemic, there is a continuous debate as to whether primary PCI should be deferred with thrombolysis-first approach being adopted in many places Hence, this study is pertinent as operators can be assured of the similar bleeding events In conclusion, radial approach should be attempted as long it is feasible while operators still need to be facile in the femoral approach","Jin, Q.

Patients and methods: We report a 26-patient case series performed following national lockdown. Patients were initially screened for COVID-19 symptoms and later all patients required a negative swab pre-operatively. Personal protective equipment using aerosol precautions was used for all cases. A post-operative ‘cold’ COVID-19 critical-care ward was created. Patients who developed possible symptoms of COVID-19 were isolated and swabbed. A telephone questionnaire was completed two weeks following discharge. Results: Three out of 26 patients developed post-operative pyrexia, but all tested negative for COVID-19. Non-COVID-19-related complication rates were consistent with our previous results. Telephone follow-up confirmed that none had experienced symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection. Overall, patient satisfaction with hospital COVID-19 precautions was high. All patients were satisfied with their decision to undergo surgery during the pandemic.

Our approach consists of two main parts: 1) the adaptive-compartmental model of the epidemic (ACM-SEIR) – a generalization of the classical SEIR model and 2) the module to tune ACM-SEIR parameters using artificial intelligence methods (collection, storage and processing of big data from heterogeneous sources) that allow the most accurate adjustment of ACM-SEIR parameters turning it into an intelligent system for decision support called herein iACM-SEIR. We show that among iACM-SEIR parameters, the most important are individual economic, demographic and psychologic characteristics of society and the governmental actions.","Levashkin, S.

The EMEE signal is highly sensitive even to small changes in the composition and properties of the object under study - gas, liquid, or solid. The method is fast and contactless, provides real-time analysis, and can be considered universal. We have an idea to create a sensor to detect COVID-19 in three cases -- in the air, on hard surfaces, and in fluids from the human body. The approach involves detecting specific reactions to the virus, even if they are invisible without specialized equipment. Our experience shows that the EMEE signal is very sensitive to weak or practically imperceptible reactions. Therefore, we believe that it is quite possible to register the presence of COVID-19. We have many experimental results in this regard that support this idea. We have experience in creating sensors to monitor the processes, composition, and properties of fluids (including biological ones), as well as to detect pollution and contamination in the atmosphere.","Ivanov, Ognyan; Todorov, Peter; Stoyanov, Zhivko",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01965v1.pdf,550

This research sought to explore the associations of daily average temperature (AT) and air quality (PM2.5) with the daily new cases of COVID-19 in the top four regions of Spain (Castilla y Leon, Castilla-La Mancha, Catalonia, and Madrid). To this end, the authors employ Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and robust panel regressions to quantify the overall co-movement between temperature, air quality, and daily cases of COVID-19 from 29 February to 17 July 2020. Overall empirical results show that temperature may not be a determinant to induce COVID-19 spread in Spain, while the rising temperature may reduce the virus transmission. However, the correlation and regression findings illustrate that air quality may speed up the transmission rate of COVID-19. Our findings are contrary to the earlier studies, which show a significant impact of temperature in raising the COVID-19 spread. The conclusions of this work can serve as an input to mitigate the rapid spread of COVID-19 in Spain and reform policies accordingly.","Shahzad, Khurram; Shahzad, Umer; Iqbal, Najaf; Shahzad, Farrukh; Fareed, Zeeshan",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,550

The fight against this pandemic is on-going on multiple fronts. While vaccinations are picking up speed, there are still billions of unvaccinated people. In this fight against the virus, diagnosis of the disease and isolation of the patients to prevent any spread play a huge role. Machine Learning approaches have assisted in the diagnosis of COVID-19 cases by analyzing chest X-rays and CT-scan images of patients. To push algorithm development and research in this direction of radiological diagnosis, a challenge to classify CT-scan series was organized in conjunction with ICCV, 2021. In this research we present a simple and shallow Convolutional Neural Network based approach, TeliNet, to classify these CT-scan images of COVID-19 patients presented as part of this competition.

METHODS: Bibliographic databases were searched to identify all studies documenting, in adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): (1) the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid in the feces; (2) the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid in the intestinal cells; (3) live SARS-CoV-2 in the feces. RESULTS: Twenty seven met the inclusion criteria. In 26 studies, the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid in the feces of COVID-19 patients had been reported. Out of the 671 patients, 312 (46.5%) had a positive stool sample for viral nucleic acid. Of these patients, 63.9% remained positive for viral nucleic acid in the feces after pharyngeal swabs became negative; Three studies also evaluated the viral ribonucleic acid in the gastrointestinal tissues and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was found in samples of 3 patients out of 8 examined (37.5%). The presence of the live virus in stool samples was confirmed in two studies but no in in a recent study from Germany. These results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect gastrointestinal epithelial cells and it may be transmitted through the digestive tract. CONCLUSION: In order to control the pandemic, every effort should be made to understand all the possible routes of transmission of the infections, even the less important ones.","Cuicchi, Dajana; Lazzarotto, Tiziana; Poggioli, Gilberto",Int. j. colorectal. dis,,550

The source of data were documents from WHO, Euro-surveillance, CDC, Saudi CDC, MOH, and journals from PubMed, Medline, etc. The inclusion searching criteria were surveillance, Covid-19, types, benefits and challenges, during the period 2005-2020. Published studies, reviews and guidelines that determined these criteria were collected. Data extraction and analysis were completed for all included articles. A critical appraisal was done based on the University of Michigan Practice Guideline's levels of evidence. The final sample for the integrative review comprised 30 studies. Results revealed that types of Covid-9 surveillance includes routine surveillance (comprehensive, case-based, and aggregated weakly methods), active, wildlife, syndromic, sentinel and sentinel-syndromic methods. Laboratory and hospital-based surveillance are another important types. Help-lines, surveys, participatory electronic, digital and event-based surveillance are relatively new cost-effective methods. Many surveillance indicators can be calculated. Timely and accurate of surveillance data is an essential element for effective Covid-19 interventions. Regarding challenges, the quality of surveillance in developing countries is constrained by resources and training. The main limitations of surveillance are under-ascertainment/under-reporting, lack of timeliness and completeness of surveillance data. In conclusion, surveillance is a cornerstones for controlling Covid-19 pandemic.

The study addresses this issue by using resilience theory to examine the effects of fear and exposure related to COVID-19 and depression. Besides, our study examines the moderating effects of self-efficacy in order to provide an understanding of how the coping abilities of the elderly may mitigate the effect of stress levels on mental health during pandemics. Our model is tested by analysing the survey data collected from Rawalpindi, a metropolitan city in Pakistan. The main results of the study confirm the positive association of pandemic-related fear and exposure virus with depression. However, self-efficacy shows a negative direct effect on depression, and the findings also confirm the moderation effect of self-efficacy on the fear of COVID-19 and depression, but the moderation effect of self-efficacy on COVID-19 exposure and depression is not supported. Based on the outcomes, some severe geriatric care policies that could weaken the pandemic-related fear, exposure to the virus, and depression are recommended.","Mumtaz, A.; Manzoor, F.; Jiang, S.; Anisur Rahaman, M.",Healthcare,,550

As it is certain that this pandemic is not the last one that the World is to experience, there are ongoing massive efforts to strengthen the resilience of today's globalised economy against the effects of future pandemics. One such measure, which has deployed widely, is the use of infrared cameras to detect febrile persons at e.g. border crossings. However, infrared thermography suffers from a number of shortcomings, which lead to high sensitivity but very poor specificity of detection. In this paper we outline our proposed method of full-body sub-mm wave thermography. The method builds on the fact that most clothing materials are relatively transmissive to submm-waves, while the skin emissivity is high, giving access to full-body thermal images. Highly specific detection of fever is possible thanks to the human body's physiological response to infections. Initial results from a small number of febrile persons will be presented. © 2021 SPIE.","Luukanen, A.; Haimakainen, H.; Kajatkari, P.",Passive and Active Millimeter-Wave Imaging XXIV 2021,,550

Trying to answer these questions, we analyze the particular case of COVID-19 detection Many works that classify this disease using X-ray images have been published;some of them use two classes (with and without COVID-19), while others include more classes (pneumonia, SARS, influenza, etc ) In this work, we carry out several classification studies with two classes, using test images that do not belong to those classes, in order to try to answer the previous questions The first studies indicate problems in these two-class systems when using a third class as a test, being classified inconsistently Deeper studies show that deep learning systems trained with two classes do not correctly extract the characteristics of pathologies, but rather differentiate the classes based on the physical characteristics of the images After the discussion, we conclude that these two-class trained deep learning systems are not valid if there are other diseases that cause similar symptoms","Muñoz-Saavedra, Luis Civit-Masot Javier Luna-Perejón Francisco Domínguez-Morales Manuel Civit Antón",Applied Sciences,,550

This high mortality can be due to social factors, genetic and immunological factors. Metabolic factors like high prevalence of diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome and hypertension were also found to contribute to the increased risk of COVID-19 infection in BAME population. In addition, a large number of BAME population are working in jobs that involve regular and daily contact with public, and this may increase risk of encountering COVID-19 infection. Therefore, future research should address all these factors and generate the correct health policy that will allow us to combat the danger of COVID-19. We recommend the establishment of BAME alliance against COVID-19 in order to improve occupational risks and hazards, adequate income protection, culturally and linguistically appropriate public health communications and decreasing barriers in accessing healthcare. The BAME alliance will initially focus on (i) development of central system to record data about COVID-19 patients from BAME population (ii) involvement of healthcare professionals and researchers from ethnic minorities and (iii) multidisciplinary and inter-institution collaboration; for example, civil engineers and architects need to think about house design and ventilation that decrease risk of COVID-19 especially in BAME populations.","Ahmed, Mohamed H",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,,550
294283,"Awareness, Knowledge, Attitude of Patients towards Preventive Measures, against Covid-19 in Resource Poor Developing Country. a Cross Sectional Survey",2020,"OBJECTIVE: Preferences of members of the public are recognized as important inputs into health care priority-setting, though knowledge of such preferences is scant. We sought to generate evidence of public preferences related to healthcare resource allocation among adults and children. METHODS: We conducted an experimental stated preference survey in a national sample of Canadian adults. Preferences were elicited across a range of scenarios and scored on a visual analogue scale. Intervention group participants were randomized to a moral reasoning exercise prior to each choice task. The main outcomes were the differences in mean preference scores by group, scenario, and demographics. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate a consistent preference by participants to allocate scarce health system resources to children. Exposure to the moral reasoning exercise weakened but did not eliminate this preference. Younger respondent age and parenthood were associated with greater preference for children. The top principles guiding participants' allocative decisions were treat equally, relieve suffering, and rescue those at risk of dying. CONCLUSIONS: Our study affirms the relevance of age in public preferences for the allocation of scarce health care resources, demonstrating a significant preference by participants to allocate healthcare resources to children. However, this preference diminishes when challenged by exposure to a range of moral principles, revealing a strong public endorsement of equality of access. Definitions of value in healthcare based on clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness may exclude moral considerations that the public values, such as equality and humanitarianism, highlighting opportunities to enrich healthcare priority-setting through public engagement.","Denburg, Avram E; Ungar, Wendy J; Chen, Shiyi; Hurley, Jeremiah; Abelson, Julia",Health Policy,,550

Exacerbated inflammation and dysregulated immune responses involving T and myeloid cells occur in COVID-19 patients with severe clinical progression. However, the differential contribution of specific subsets of dendritic cells and monocytes to ARDS is still poorly understood. In addition, the role of CD8+ T cells present in the lung of COVID-19 patients and relevant for viral control has not been characterized. Here, we have studied the frequencies and activation profiles of dendritic cells and monocytes present in the blood and lung of COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity in comparison with healthy individuals. Furthermore, these subpopulations and their association with antiviral effector CD8+ T cell subsets were also characterized in lung infiltrates from critical COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that inflammatory transitional and nonclassical monocytes and CD1c+ conventional dendritic cells preferentially migrate from blood to lungs in patients with severe COVID-19. Thus, this study increases the knowledge of specific myeloid subsets involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease and could be useful for the design of therapeutic strategies for fighting SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sánchez-Cerrillo, Ildefonso; Landete, Pedro; Aldave, Beatriz; Sánchez-Alonso, Santiago; Sánchez-Azofra, Ana; Marcos-Jiménez, Ana; Ávalos, Elena; Alcaraz-Serna, Ana; de Los Santos, Ignacio; Mateu-Albero, Tamara; Esparcia, Laura; López-Sanz, Celia; Martínez-Fleta, Pedro; Gabrie, Ligia; Del Campo Guerola, Luciana; de la Fuente, Hortensia; Calzada, María J; González-Álvaro, Isidoro; Alfranca, Arantzazu; Sánchez-Madrid, Francisco; Muñoz-Calleja, Cecilia; Soriano, Joan B; Ancochea, Julio; Martín-Gayo, Enrique",J Clin Invest,,550

As a result, 372 public libraries in NSW ceased operation on the 23rd March 2020. While the closure of public libraries will undoubtedly contribute to restricting the spread of the coronavirus, given the pivotal role played by municipal libraries in local communities, as well as the special characteristics of library patrons, it will have other negative consequences. In this paper we consider the impact of the closure of municipal libraries in NSW from two perspectives: (a) its effect on the fiscal circumstances of local authorities and (b) its impact on the spread of the corona contagion as well as its broader effects on local community wellbeing. We conclude that rather than complete closure, partial constraints on library use should have been considered.","Wallace, Andrea; Dollery, Brian",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,550

As such, EDs must be able to reorganize and reformat operations to meet the changing needs and staggering patient volume. This paper addresses ways to adapt departmental operations to better manage in times of elevated disease burden, specifically identifying areas of intervention to help limit crowding and spread. Using experience from past outbreaks and the current COVID-19 pandemic, we advise strategies to increase surge capacity and limit patient inflow. Triage should identify and geographically cohort symptomatic patients within a designated unit to limit exposure early in an outbreak. Screening and PPE guidelines for both patient and staff should be followed closely, as determined by hospital administration and the CDC. Equipment needs are also greatly affected in an outbreak; we emphasis portable radiographic equipment to limit transport, and an upstocking of certain medications, respiratory supplies, and PPE.","Whiteside, Tess; Kane, Erin; Aljohani, Bandar; Alsamman, Marya; Pourmand, Ali",Am J Emerg Med,,550

Fibrin glue as an alternative for microarterial anastomosis may obviate these lesions, with less adherence to adjacent tissues and better coaptation of the arterial margins. OBJECTIVE: In this study we compared the healing process of conventional to fibrin glue end-to-end anastomosis in larger arteries. METHODS: In 22 rabbits, both carotid arteries were cross sectioned and repaired by end-to-end anastomosis with 4 interrupted sutures and fibrin glue in one side (GI) and with 8 conventional interrupted sutures in the other side (G2). After 3 and 15 days, the animals were randomly allocated for tensile strength, hydroxyproline determination (8 animals), and histologic analysis of the anastomosis (3 animals). Conventional staining procedures (hematoxylin-eosin and Masson methods) and picrosirius red polarization (PSP) technique for collagen type determination were employed. RESULTS: From 3 to 15 days, the tensile strength increased in both groups, from 280.0± 32.6 g to 432.2± 131.2g in Group I and from 221.4± 72.4g to 452.2± 132.0g in Group 2 (p 0.001), with no statistical difference between the groups in each period of the study. The hydroxyproline content, expressed as hydroxyproline /protein ratio, varied from 0.0816 ± 0.0651 to 0.0622 ± 0.0184 in Group l and from 0.0734 ± 0.0577 to 0.0460 ± 0.0271 in Group 2, with no significant difference between periods and groups (p>0.05). Histology showed slight increase of inflammatory and reparative reactions in Group 2. PSP technique demonstrated predominant type I collagen in relation to type III collagen in the anastomosis of both groups, with no significant difference between them. CONCLUSION: Fibrin glue was less harmful to the arterial wall than conventional suture. Even using less sutures in fibrin glue anastomosis, similar tensile strength and healing characteristics were noted in both groups. Completion times for the fibrin glue group was significantly greater than for the conventional anastomosis.","B. Yoshida, Winston; E. Naresse, Luiz; C. Rodrigues, Antonio; E. Fabris, Viciany; Y.

The ability of infectious particles to persist on environmental surfaces is potentially considered a factor for viral spreading. Therefore, limiting viral diffusion in public environments should be achieved with correct disinfection of objects, tissues, and clothes. This study proves how two widespread disinfection systems, short-wavelength ultraviolet light (UV-C) and ozone (O3), are active in vitro on different commonly used materials. The development of devices equipped with UV-C, or ozone generators, may prevent the virus from spreading in public places.","Criscuolo, Elena; Diotti, Roberta A; Ferrarese, Roberto; Alippi, Cesare; Viscardi, Gabriele; Signorelli, Carlo; Mancini, Nicasio; Clementi, Massimo; Clementi, Nicola",Emerg Microbes Infect,,550

The population that particularly has been affected by the pandemic is the group of patients suffering from diabetes mellitus. Having taken the public health in considerations, we have decided to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of diabetes mellitus on in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature review (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane) including all published clinical trials or observational studies published till December 10, 2020, was performed using following terms ""diabetes mellitus"" OR ""diabetes"" OR ""DM"" AND ""survival"" OR ""mortality"" AND ""SARS-CoV-2"" OR ""COVID-19"". RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included out of the 7327 initially identified studies. Mortality of DM patients vs non-DM patients was 21.3 versus 6.1%, respectively (OR = 2.39; 95%CI: 1.65, 3.64; P < 0.001), while severe disease in DM and non-DM group varied and amounted to 34.8% versus 22.8% (OR = 1.43; 95%CI: 0.82, 2.50; P = 0.20). In the DM group, the complications were observed far more often when compared with non-DM group, both in acute respiratory distress (31.4 vs. 17.2%; OR = 2.38; 95%CI:1.80, 3.13; P < 0.001), acute cardiac injury (22.0% vs. 12.8%; OR = 2.59; 95%CI: 1.81, 3.73; P < 0.001), and acute kidney injury (19.1 vs. 10.2%; OR = 1.97; 95%CI: 1.36, 2.85; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings, we shall conclude that diabetes is an independent risk factor of the severity of COVID-19 in-hospital settings; therefore, patients with diabetes shall aim to reduce the exposure to the potential infection of COVID-19.","Kaminska, Halla; Szarpak, Lukasz; Kosior, Dariusz; Wieczorek, Wojciech; Szarpak, Agnieszka; Al-Jeabory, Mahdi; Gawel, Wladyslaw; Gasecka, Aleksandra; Jaguszewski, Milosz J; Jarosz-Chobot, Przemyslawa",Acta Diabetol,,550

301775,COVID-19 crisis prompting innovation in addressing personal protective equipment shortage,2020,"Background and aims: Changes in the nomenclature of addictions suggest a significant shift in the conceptualization of addictions, where non-substance related behaviors can also be classified as addictions. A large amount of data provides empirical evidence that there are overlaps of different types of addictive behaviors in etiology, phenomenology, and in the underlying psychological and biological mechanisms. Our aim was to investigate the co-occurrences of a wide range of substance use and behavioral addictions. Methods: The present epidemiological analysis was carried out as part of the Psychological and Genetic Factors of the Addictive Behaviors (PGA) Study, where data were collected from 3,003 adolescents and young adults (42.6% males; mean age 21 years). Addictions to psychoactive substances and behaviors were rigorously assessed. Results: Data is provided on lifetime occurrences of the assessed substance uses, their co-occurrences, the prevalence estimates of specific behavioral addictions, and co-occurrences of different substance use and potentially addictive behaviors. Associations were found between (i) smoking and problematic Internet use, exercising, eating disorders, and gambling (ii) alcohol consumption and problematic Internet use, problematic online gaming, gambling, and eating disorders, and (iii) cannabis use and problematic online gaming and gambling. Conclusions: The results suggest a large overlap between the occurrence of these addictions and behaviors and underlies the importance of investigating the possible common psychological, genetic and neural pathways. These data further support concepts such as the Reward Deficiency Syndrome and the component model of addictions that propose a common phenomenological and etiological background of different addictive and related behaviors.","Kotyuk, Eszter; Magi, Anna; Eisinger, Andrea; Király, Orsolya; Vereczkei, Andrea; Barta, Csaba; Griffiths, Mark D; Székely, Anna; Kökönyei, Gyöngyi; Farkas, Judit; Kun, Bernadette; Badgaiyan, Rajendra D; Urbán, Róbert; Blum, Kenneth; Demetrovics, Zsolt",J. behav. addict.

302154,Reply to “Integral management of COVID-19 in Madrid: Turning things around during the second wave”,2021,"BACKGROUND: Aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) may reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The extent to which these interventions are successful in stopping the spread have not been characterized in countries with distinct socioeconomic groups. We compared the effects of a partial lockdown on disease transmission among Kuwaitis (P1) and non-Kuwaitis (P2) living in Kuwait. METHODS: We fit a modified metapopulation SEIR transmission model to reported cases stratified by two groups to estimate the impact of a partial lockdown on the effective reproduction number ([Formula: see text]). We estimated the basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) for the transmission in each group and simulated the potential trajectories of an outbreak from the first recorded case of community transmission until 12 days after the partial lockdown. We estimated [Formula: see text] values of both groups before and after the partial curfew, simulated the effect of these values on the epidemic curves and explored a range of cross-transmission scenarios. RESULTS: We estimate [Formula: see text] at 1·08 (95% CI: 1·00-1·26) for P1 and 2·36 (2·03-2·71) for P2. On March 22nd, [Formula: see text] for P1 and P2 are estimated at 1·19 (1·04-1·34) and 1·75 (1·26-2·11) respectively. After the partial curfew had taken effect, [Formula: see text] for P1 dropped modestly to 1·05 (0·82-1·26) but almost doubled for P2 to 2·89 (2·30-3·70). Our simulated epidemic trajectories show that the partial curfew measure greatly reduced and delayed the height of the peak in P1, yet significantly elevated and hastened the peak in P2. Modest cross-transmission between P1 and P2 greatly elevated the height of the peak in P1 and brought it forward in time closer to the peak of P2. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate and quantify how the same lockdown intervention can accentuate disease transmission in some subpopulations while potentially controlling it in others. Any such control may further become compromised in the presence of cross-transmission between subpopulations. Future interventions and policies need to be sensitive to socioeconomic and health disparities.","Khadadah, Fatima; Al-Shammari, Abdullah A; Alhashemi, Ahmad; Alhuwail, Dari; Al-Saif, Bader; Alzaid, Saud N; Alahmad, Barrak; Bogoch, Isaac I",BMC Public Health,,550

METHOD: This is a brief note in which authors rely on various statistics and insights regarding domestic violence since the detection of Covid-19. Based on the available statistics regarding domestic violence prevalence during previous times of uncertainty, the number and nature of domestic violence incidents around the globe, and existing literature, the authors argue that clear links exist between Covid-19 and domestic violence, which also impacts on the economic and social crisis. RESULTS: Countries across the world are battling Covid-19 by enacting measures to reduce the speed of transmission. Multiple reports, however, suggest that such measures are increasing the incidence of domestic violence and not only in number but also in severity. We find that layoffs, loss of income, extended domestic stays, and exposure to habits due to stay-at-home orders are driving up the incidence of domestic violence. Moreover, these domestic violence increases are driving economic and social crises due to the form and severity of the violence, the burden placed on government, a crisis of resources, and decreases in the productivity of workforces. CONCLUSION: Domestic violence increase resulting from Covid-19 is an indirect driver of economic and social crisis. This brief note proposes certain policy changes and strategies required to reduce domestic violence incidence during this turbulent time.","Sharma, Amalesh; Borah, Sourav Bikash",J Fam Violence,,550

304642,Psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors among frontline doctors of Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major disruption to the delivery of both routine and urgent healthcare needs in many institutions across the globe. Vascular access (VA) for haemodalysis (HD) is considered the patient's lifeline and its maintenance is essential for the continuation of a life saving treatment. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the provision of VA for dialysis was already constrained. Throughout the pandemic, inevitably, many patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have not received timely intervention for VA care. This could have a detrimental impact on dialysis patient outcomes in the near future and needs to be addressed urgently. Many societies have issued prioritisation to allow rationing based on clinical risk, mainly according to estimated urgency and need for treatment. The recommendations recently proposed by the European and American Vascular Societies in the COVID-19 pandemic era regarding the triage of various vascular operations into urgent, emergent and elective are debatable. VA creation and interventions maintain the lifeline of complex HD patients, and the indication for surgery and other interventions warrants patient-specific clinical judgement and pathways. Keeping the use of central venous catheters at a minimum, with the goal of creating the right access, in the right patient, at the right time, and for the right reasons, is mandatory. These strategies may require local modifications. Risk assessments may need specific ""renal pathways"" to be developed rather than applying standard surgical risk stratification. In conclusion, in order to recover from the second wave of COVID-19 and prepare for further phases, the provision of the best dialysis access, including peritoneal dialysis, will require working closely with the multidisciplinary team involved in the assessment, creation, cannulation, surveillance, maintenance, and salvage of definitive access.","Basile, Carlo; Lomonte, Carlo; Combe, Christian; Covic, Adrian; Kirmizis, Dimitrios; Liakopoulos, Vassilios; Mitra, Sandip",J Nephrol,,550

The state and its institutions were forced to take certain measures to facilitate the survival and continuation of business, and to save jobs for entrepreneurs and their employees. The Tax Administration is a state institution whose measures directly affect every business. So it was among the first to take some measures, i.e. to adjust its business and tax collection to the new situation. This paper discusses the first measures introduced, those from March and April 2020. It discusses the deferral or installment payment of due and deferred tax liabilities. The measure of deferral, installment payment of tax liability, is certainly the most important and most popular measure among taxpayers. It is explained how tax measures during a pandemic should look according to the recommendations of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). We explain other measures that have been introduced to facilitate business. These are the extension of the deadline for filing income tax, the exemption from VAT, the enforcement procedure and the payment of the annual tax rate. Despite the measures taken so far, it is important to emphasize that the Covid-19 pandemic is still ongoing, and that according to some experts, a real crisis with visible consequences of the pandemic is still to be expected. Accordingly, it is to be expected that the current measures are very likely to be further changed, upgraded and adjusted as the situation changes. We consider it important to note that the framework of this paper does not allow a detailed analysis and that we are forced to limit ourselves exclusively to some aspects of the issue at hand.","Peric, R.; Jerkovic, E.",Eu 2021 - the Future of the Eu in and after the Pandemic,,550

The impact of COVID-19 on blood pressure (BP) control and hypertension remains insufficiently explored. We therefore provide a comprehensive review of the potential changes in lifestyle factors and behaviours as well as environmental changes likely to influence BP control and cardiovascular risk during the pandemic. This includes the impact on physical activity, dietary patterns, alcohol consumption and the resulting consequences, for example increases in body weight. Other risk factors for increases in BP and cardiovascular risk such as smoking, emotional/psychologic stress, changes in sleep patterns and diurnal rhythms may also exhibit significant changes in addition to novel factors such as air pollution and environmental noise. We also highlight potential preventive measures to improve BP control because hypertension is the leading preventable risk factor for worldwide health during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kreutz, Reinhold; Dobrowolski, Piotr; Prejbisz, Aleksander; Algharably, Engi A E-H; Bilo, Grzegorz; Creutzig, Felix; Grassi, Guido; Kotsis, Vasilios; Lovic, Dragan; Lurbe, Empar; Modesti, Pietro A; Pappaccogli, Marco; Parati, Gianfranco; Persu, Alexandre; Polonia, Jorge; Rajzer, Marek; de Timary, Philippe; Weber, Thomas; Weisser, Burkhard; Tsioufis, Konstantinos; Mancia, Giuseppe; Januszewicz, Andrzej",J Hypertens,,550

We identified potential shared targets for an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 by immune determinants shared identities with Plasmodium falciparum using IEDB's Immune browser tool 9.0. Probable cross-reactivity is suggested through HLA-A*02:01 and subsequent CD8+ T cell activation. The apparent immunodominant epitope conservation between SARS-COV-2 (N and Orf1ab) and P. falciparum thrombospondin-anonymous-related protein (TRAP) may underlie the low COVID-19 incidence in the malaria-endemic zone by providing immunity against virus infection to those previously infected with plasmodium. Additionally, the shared epitopes lie within antigens which aid in the establishment of the P. falciparum invasion to the erythrocytes may hypothesize an alternative route for SARS-CoV-2, though yet to be proven, via erythrocyte CD147 receptor.","Iesa, Mohamed Am; Osman, Makarim Em; Hassan, Mohamed A; Dirar, Amina Ia; Abuzeid, Nadir; Mancuso, James J; Pandey, Ritu; Mohammed, Arwa A; Borad, Mitesh J; Babiker, Hani M; Konozy, Emadeldin He",New Microbes New Infect,,550

The identification of risk groups is essential for the establishment of preventive and therapeutic strategies, as for substance users. During COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in the use of psychoactive substances during the lockdown, including cannabis. This commentary reviews relevant findings and discusses scientific evidence on the risks of worse clinical and psychiatric complications due to coronavirus disease COVID-19 in subjects who use cannabis. Although they are not included as a risk group in the health recommendations for that disease, they may have a more vulnerable respiratory system to viral diseases. There are certain similarities between the harmful cardiovascular and respiratory effects of cannabis use and those of smoking. Due to the different modes of smoking, cannabis chemicals are retained in the body for longe and may also contain other toxic substances such as tar, a substance found in tobacco and which has been associated with the development of lung cancer, bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema. Therefore, we discuss if individuals who use cannabis regularly might be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. This population deserves more clinical attention worldwide and this manuscript can help clinicians become more aware of cannabis risks during pandemics and develop specific intervention strategies.","Borgonhi, Ellen Mello; Volpatto, Vanessa Loss; Ornell, Felipe; Rabelo-da-Ponte, Francisco Diego; Kessler, Felix Henrique Paim",Addict Sci Clin Pract,,550

Objective: To evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Anhui and to identify predictors of viral clearance. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data collected from discharged patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. We compared clinical features between viral clearance and viral persistence, and evaluated factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 shedding using multiple linear regression. Results: Among the 83 patients involved in the study, the median age was 43 years, while 60.2% were male, 35.4% had comorbidities, and the mortality was zero. The median time from illness onset to admission was 5 days (interquartile range (IQR), 2-7 days), and the median time from the illness onset to SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 16 days (IQR, 13-18 days). The factors influencing viral clearance were as follows: (1) delayed admission (beta 1.057, 95% CI 0.810-1.304; p &#8804; 0.001) and (2) underlying comorbidities (beta 1.907, 95% CI 0.198-3.616; p = 0.029). No significant differences were observed in the length of stay (p = 0.246) and pneumonia between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients based on computed tomography (CT) (p = 0.124). Conclusions: Delayed admission and underlying comorbidities may effectively predict SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance. For those infected with SARS-CoV-2, even asymptomatic patients without any clinical symptoms should be traced and isolated. This practice may reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and slow the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the virus.

307431,Primary Care and Mental Health: Overview of Integrated Care Models,2020,"Background: Market vendors occupy a strategic position in the fight against the spread of SARS CoV-2 in rural Uganda. To successfully contain the spread of the virus, special attention needs to be given to this set of people by assessing the type of information, source of information, and practices they inculcate as regards adherence to WHO guidelines in the fight against COVID-19 in Uganda. The study aimed to assess the role of information sources, education level, and phone internet connectivity in influencing COVID-19 knowledge among the rural market vendors; and the relationship existing between knowledge, attitude, and practices among them. Methods: The study was a descriptive cross-sectional study among rural market vendors (n = 248) in southwestern Uganda. Information was collected using a questionnaire and descriptively presented as frequency and percentages. Results: The study showed that the majority of the rural market vendors had sufficient information regarding COVID-19 with the majority being female individuals and have attained a secondary level of education, The general percentage score for knowledge, attitude, and practices were (75.57, 82.6, and 76.50% respectively). There was a positive correlation between attitude and practices (r = 0.17, p = 0.007), as well as their knowledge with practices (r = 0.29, p &lt; 0.001).

Early risk communication scholars studied public perceptions of risk in response to environmental disasters, or infectious disease outbreaks. They found acceptability of risk, and any limitations and acceptability of response by experts was shaped by two key components: hazard and outrage. The number of people who are exposed, infected and fall ill can be considered the hazard. How the public and patients perceive the risk and respond to messages regarding risk mitigation relates to outrage. Social and cultural factors, immediacy, uncertainty, familiarity, personal control, scientific uncertainty and trust in institutions and media all shape acceptability of response. These outrage factors influence the ever-changing public understanding of COVID-19 risk, as well as the public's acceptance of personal and societal mitigation strategies. Risk perceptions and acceptability of mitigation strategies are also largely shaped in the context of culture and society. In concert, hazard and outrage along with cultural and economic context shape adherence to, and overall acceptance of, personal mitigation strategies including wearing facemasks, and social distancing among the general public. The spread of misinformation on social media in the context of crisis communication provides both challenges and opportunities for experts and officials to effectively communicate and influence these outrage factors. Social media offers an opportunity for experts to quickly convey true information about hazards, but offers others the opportunity to counter this with the spread of misinformation and exacerbate outrage. We propose strategies for infectious diseases clinicians to apply risk communication principles and frameworks to improve patient care and public message development in response to COVID-19.","Malecki, Kristen; Keating, Julie A; Safdar, Nasia",Clin. infect. dis,,550

However, due to the low viral load specimens and the limitations of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which results in failure to timely diagnose, cut off transmission, and assess discharge criteria. To improve this situation, an optimized droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which showed that the limit of detection of ddPCR is significantly lower than that of RT-PCR. We further explored the feasibility of ddPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 77 patients, and compared with RT-PCR in terms of the diagnostic accuracy based on the results of follow-up survey. 26 patients of COVID-19 with negative RT-PCR reports were reported as positive by ddPCR. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, negative likelihood ratio (NLR) and accuracy were improved from 40% (95% CI: 27-55%), 100% (95% CI: 54-100%), 100%, 16% (95% CI: 13-19%), 0.6 (95% CI: 0.48-0.75) and 47% (95% CI: 33-60%) for RT-PCR to 94% (95% CI: 83-99%), 100% (95% CI: 48-100%), 100%, 63% (95% CI: 36-83%), 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02-0.18), and 95% (95% CI: 84-99%) for ddPCR, respectively. Moreover, 6/14 (42.9%) convalescents were detected as positive by ddPCR at 5-12 days post discharge. Overall, ddPCR shows superiority for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negative reports, which could be a powerful complement to the RT-PCR.","Suo, Tao; Liu, Xinjin; Feng, Jiangpeng; Guo, Ming; Hu, Wenjia; Guo, Dong; Ullah, Hafiz; Yang, Yang; Zhang, Qiuhan; Wang, Xin; Sajid, Muhanmmad; Huang, Zhixiang; Deng, Liping; Chen, Tielong; Liu, Fang; Xu, Ke; Liu, Yuan; Zhang, Qi; Liu, Yingle; Xiong, Yong; Chen, Guozhong; Lan, Ke; Chen, Yu",Emerg Microbes Infect,,550

METHODS: It was conducted on pregnant women (n = 149) who attended routine pregnancy prenatal visit during their pregnancy weeks. The data were collected using sociodemographic and clinical data form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to evaluate sleep quality, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) to evaluate maternal depression and anxiety. RESULTS: A significant correlation was observed between the week of gestation and depression, anxiety, and defective sleep scores (p < 0.001). A moderate positive correlation was found between the week of gestation and depression (r: 0.628). A high level of positive correlation was found between the week of gestation and defective sleep quality and anxiety scores (r: 0.858, r: 0.754). A statistically significant increase in depression, anxiety, and defective sleep quality was found in the group staying in home quarantine (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: This study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic can cause depression, anxiety, and serious sleep disorders in pregnant women. The depression and anxiety scores of pregnant women in home quarantine were also found to be higher than the group not in quarantine. As the week of gestation progresses, mental health symptoms worsen and sleep quality deteriorates.","Çolak, Sabri; Gürlek, Beril; Önal, Özgür; Yilmaz, Bülent; Hocaoglu, Cicek",J. obstet. gynaecol. res,,550

308909,Primary care physician's approach for mental health impact of COVID-19,2020,"Adequate functioning of a sewage treatment plant (STP) is essential to protect the downstream aquatic environment (ECHA 2017), and information on the degradability of chemicals and their toxicity to activated sludge microorganisms is required. An environmental realistic higher tier test is a STP simulation test as described in OECD 303A (2001) which for nanoparticles can also be used to study their sorption behavior to activated sludge. However, information is limited on the influence of synthetic sewage on the microbial community of the activated sludge. A modified community can result in modifications of the sludge floccules affecting the sorption behavior. The main objective of our study was to show whether a representative microbial diversity remains under standardized test conditions as described in OECD 303A (2001) using synthetic sewage as influent. Furthermore, we investigated whether just considering the functional properties of a STP (elimination of dissolved organic carbon; nitrification), is sufficient for an assessment of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) or whether the influence on microbial diversity also needs to be considered. AuNPs were used as a case study due to their rising medical applications and therefore increasing probability to reach the sewer and STP. The results can provide significant input for the interpretation of results from the regulatory point of view. To deliver these objectives, the general changes of the microbial population in activated sludge and its influence on the degradation activity (dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and inorganic nitrogen) using freshly collected sludge from the municipal STP in an artificial test system as a model STP in accordance with OECD 303A (2001) were assessed. Additionally, we evaluated the potential impact of AuNPs and its dispersant on the microbial composition and the overall impact on the function of the STP in terms of DOC degradation and nitrogen removal to observe if an assessment based on functional properties is sufficient. The bacteria composition in our study, evaluated at a class level, revealed commonly described environmental bacteria. Proteobacteria (ß, &#945;, Î´) accounted for more than 50% but also nitrifying bacteria as Nitrospira were present. Our results show that mainly within the first 7 days of an acclimatization phase by addition of synthetic sewage, the bacterial community changed. Even though AuNPs can have antibacterial properties, no adverse effects on the function and structure of the microorganisms in the STP could be detected at concentrations of increased modeled PEC values by a factor of about 10,000. Complementary to other metallic nanomaterials, gold nanomaterials also sorb to a large extent to the activated sludge. If activated sludge is used as fertilizer on agricultural land, gold nanoparticles can be introduced into soils. In this case, the effect on soil (micro)organisms must be investigated more closely, also taking into account the structural diversity.","Schlich, Karsten; Díaz, Cecilia; Gomez Pizarro, Benjamin; Knopf, Burkhard; Schlinkert, Ruben; Wege, Franziska Frederike; Jurack, Anne; Hund-Rinke, Kerstin",,,550

I suggest that being ‘locked in’ is intrinsic to life at sea, as one can’t simply leave a ship. What makes the experience of the pandemic so challenging at sea is being ‘locked out’ of land. With border closures prohibiting ‘crew change’, many seafarers have been forced to extend their contracts, stay aboard, and postpone going home for long and often undefined periods of time. My article combines a reflexive personal narrative of being confined to a ship at sea for five months, while being excluded from land, with the question of how spending the pandemic at sea could be understood in relation to maritime labour.","De Beukelaer, Christiaan",Cultural Studies,,550

Here, we investigate associations between plasma ACE2 and outcome of COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: This analysis used data from a large longitudinal study of 306 COVID-19 positive patients and 78 COVID-19 negative patients (MGH Emergency Department COVID-19 Cohort). Comprehensive clinical data were collected on this cohort, including 28-day outcomes. The samples were run on the Olink® Explore 1536 platform which includes measurement of the ACE2 protein. High admission plasma ACE2 in COVID-19 patients was associated with increased maximal illness severity within 28 days with OR = 1.8, 95%-CI: 1.4-2.3 (P < 0.0001). Plasma ACE2 was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with hypertension compared with patients without hypertension (P = 0.0045). Circulating ACE2 was also significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing heart conditions and kidney disease compared with patients without these pre-existing conditions (P = 0.0363 and P = 0.0303, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that measuring plasma ACE2 is potentially valuable in predicting COVID-19 outcomes. Further, ACE2 could be a link between COVID-19 illness severity and its established risk factors hypertension, pre-existing heart disease and pre-existing kidney disease.","Kragstrup, Tue W; Singh, Helene Søgaard; Grundberg, Ida; Nielsen, Ane Langkilde-Lauesen; Rivellese, Felice; Mehta, Arnav; Goldberg, Marcia B; Filbin, Michael R; Qvist, Per; Bibby, Bo Martin",PLoS One,,550

METHODS: Gastric cancer cell lines MGC803 and BGC823 were treated by 0, 0.3%, 1%, 3% and 10% KAI for 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. The cell proliferation was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The apoptosis and cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry. Interleukin (IL)-6 mRNA and protein expression levels were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The protein expression levels of cyclin A, cyclin E, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, p21, retinoblastoma (RB), protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT3 were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: KAI inhibited the proliferation of MGC803 and BGC823 gastric cancer cells in dose- and time-dependent manner. After treated with KAI for 48 h, the proportion of G1 phase was increased, expression level of cyclin D1 and phosphorylation-RB were down-regulated, whereas the expression of p21 was up-regulated (all P<0.01). Furthermore, 48-h treatment with KAI decreased the phosphorylation level of STAT3, inhibited the mRNA and protein expressions of IL-6 (all P<0.01). IL-6 at dose of 10 ng/mL significantly attenuated the proliferative effect of both 3% and 10% KAI, and recovered KAI-inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and cyclin D1 expression level (all P<0.01). CONCLUSION: KAI exerted an anti-proliferative function by inhibiting IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway followed by the induction of G1 phase arrest in gastric cancer cells.","Zheng, Chun-Lei; Hou, Ke-Zuo; Wang, An-Qi; Fang, Wan-Xia; Yu, Shi-Tong; Liang, Jin-E; Qi, Hai-Yan; Qu, Xiu-Juan; Liu, Yun-Peng; Che, Xiao-Fang",Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine,,550

It is one of the most severe and common, is usually observed in the elderly mainly in poorly controlled diabetes. The proper treatment requires involvement of doctors of various specialities and, although numerous newest, supportive therapies and rehabilitation are used, the diabetic foot syndrom may lead to limb amputation and, consequently, serious disability. A CASE REPORT: A patient was hospitalized in the Department of Oncological Surgery UCK in July and August 2020. He was admitted to the Department from the Emergency Department due to the phlegmon of the left foot and toes necrosis in progress of the diabetic foot syndrome. The patient was treated with type II insulin-dependent diabetes for many years. In the last months before admission to the hospital, the controls in the Diabetic and Diabetic Foot Syndrom Outpatient Departments were not exact due to the ongoing pandemic of COVID- 19. Thanks to the use of modern techniques of local wound healing, including negative pressure wound therapy and supportive therapies it was possible to preserve the limb, despite being qualified for amputation on admission to the hospital. We achieved a fairly good cosmetic effect and in the consequence - a chance for an independent life in an acceptable condition.

METHODS: The ""Co-Pilot Project,"" which operates under its parent non-profit organization, Razom, organized multiple trips for American physicians to Ukraine. Activities included consulting in clinic, assisting with neurosurgical operations, and providing didactic lectures. Further efforts have included coordinating training opportunities for Ukrainian surgeons. We retrospectively reviewed all operations performed by Ukrainian ""partner"" physicians alongside American ""co-pilot"" physicians across Ukraine since August 2016. RESULTS: Teams of Ukrainian and American physicians operated on 78 patients (24 children and 54 adults) for a total of 84 procedures in five different cities (Kyiv, Lutsk, Lviv, Odesa, and Stryi) of Ukraine. Operations were classified into the following categories: adult brain tumors (39), adult spine tumors (1), epilepsy (9), pain (2), pediatric brain tumors (11), vascular/endovascular (10), and miscellaneous (12). Four illustrative cases are described in detail. Of the patients with brain tumors, 43.5% (20/46) had giant tumors and gross total resection (GTR) or near total resection (NTR) was achieved in 78.3% (36/46). CONCLUSIONS: Profound disparities in neurosurgical care exist globally which has led to the formation of collaborative relationships between physicians from various countries. We hope that the work of the ""Co-Pilot Project"" in Ukraine can serve as a template for effective international neurosurgical collaboration in other low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs).","Tomycz, Luke D; Markosian, Christopher; Kurilets, Igor; Lovha, Mykhailo; Kashyrina, Oleksandra; Netliukh, Andrii; Kostiuk, Kostiantyn; Cheburakhin, Valeriy; Polishchuk, Andriy; Forbes, Jonathan; Cohen, Michael; Miley, Jefferson; Geck, Matthew; Siryk, Hanna; Mykytyn, Taras; Diakiv, Volodymyr; Salo, Viktor; Yushchak, Igor; Soroka, Mariya",World neurosurgery (Online),,550

METHODS: We designed primers specific to the orf1ab and S genes of SARS-CoV-2. Total viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. We optimized the RT-LAMP assay, and evaluated it for its sensitivity and specificity of detection using real-time turbidity monitoring and visual observation. RESULTS: The primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123 amplified the genes in the shortest times, the mean (±SD) times were 18 ± 1.32 min and 20 ± 1.80 min, respectively, and 63°C was the optimum reaction temperature. The sensitivities were 2 × 101 copies and 2 × 102 copies per reaction with primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123, respectively. This assay showed no cross-reactivity with 60 other respiratory pathogens. To describe the availability of this method in clinical diagnosis, we collected 130 specimens from patients with clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among them, 58 were confirmed to be positive and 72 were negative by RT-LAMP. The sensitivity was 100% (95% CI 92.3%-100%), specificity 100% (95% CI 93.7%-100%). This assay detected SARS-CoV-2 in a mean (±SD) time of 26.28 ± 4.48 min and the results can be identified with visual observation. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that we developed a rapid, simple, specific and sensitive RT-LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection among clinical samples. It will be a powerful tool for SARS-CoV-2 identification, and for monitoring suspected patients, close contacts and high-risk groups.","Yan, C; Cui, J; Huang, L; Du, B; Chen, L; Xue, G; Li, S; Zhang, W; Zhao, L; Sun, Y; Yao, H; Li, N; Zhao, H; Feng, Y; Liu, S; Zhang, Q; Liu, D; Yuan, J",Clin Microbiol Infect,,550

This study investigated the risk and protective factors associated with psychological distress among Hubei residents during the peak of the outbreak. Data were obtained from a combined online and telephone survey of 1,682 respondents. Various COVID-19-related stressors, including risk exposure, limited medical treatment access, inadequate basic supplies, reduced income, excessive exposure to COVID-19-related information, and perceived discrimination, were associated with psychological distress. Neighborhood social support can reduce psychological distress and buffer the effect of COVID-19-related stressors, whereas support from friends/relatives affected stress coping limitedly. Interventions to reduce stressors and promote neighborhood support are vital to reduce psychological distress during infectious disease outbreaks.","Chen, Xi; Zou, Yuchun; Gao, Haiyan",Health Place,,550

330642,Healthcare Workers in Brazil during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Online Survey,2020,"Motivated by the recent outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19), we propose a stochastic model of epidemic temporal growth and mitigation based on a time-modulated Hawkes process. The model is sufficiently rich to incorporate specific characteristics of the novel coronavirus, to capture the impact of undetected, asymptomatic and super-diffusive individuals, and especially to take into account time-varying counter-measures and detection efforts. Yet, it is simple enough to allow scalable and efficient computation of the temporal evolution of the epidemic, and exploration of what-if scenarios. Compared to traditional compartmental models, our approach allows a more faithful description of virus specific features, such as distributions for the time spent in stages, which is crucial when the time-scale of control (e.g., mobility restrictions) is comparable to the lifetime of a single infection. We apply the model to the first and second wave of COVID-19 in Italy, shedding light onto several effects related to mobility restrictions introduced by the government, and to the effectiveness of contact tracing and mass testing performed by the national health service.","Garetto, Michele; Leonardi, Emilio; Torrisi, Giovanni Luca",Annual reviews in control,,550
330790,Evaluation of attitudes towards telemedicine as a basis for successful implementation: A cross-sectional survey among postgraduate trainees in family medicine in Germany,2020,"BACKGROUND: Queensland, Australia has been successful in containing the COVID-19 pandemic. Underpinning that response has been a highly effective virus containment strategy which relies on identification, isolation, and contact tracing of cases. The dramatic emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic rendered traditional paper-based systems for managing contact tracing no longer fit for purpose. A rapid digital transformation of the public health contact tracing system occurred to support this effort. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the digital transformation were to shift legacy systems (paper or standalone electronic systems) to a digitally enabled public health system, where data are centered around the consumer rather than isolated databases. The objective of this paper is to outline this case study and detail the lessons learnt to inform and give confidence to others contemplating digitization of public health systems in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This case study is set in Queensland, Australia. Universal health care is available. A multidisciplinary team was established consisting of clinical informaticians, developers, data strategists, and health information managers. An agile ""pair-programming"" approach was undertaken to application development and extensive change efforts were made to maximize adoption of the new digital workflows. Data governance and flows were changed to support rapid management of the pandemic. RESULTS: The digital coronavirus application (DCOVA) is a web-based application that securely captures information about people required to quarantine and creates a multiagency secure database to support a successful containment strategy. CONCLUSION: Most of the literature surrounding digital transformation allows time for significant consultation, which was simply not possible under crisis conditions. Our observation is that staff was willing to adopt new digital systems because the reason for change (the COVID-19 pandemic) was clearly pressing. This case study highlights just how critical a unified purpose, is to successful, rapid digital transformation.","Sullivan, Clair; Wong, Ides; Adams, Emily; Fahim, Magid; Fraser, Jon; Ranatunga, Gihan; Busato, Matthew; McNeil, Keith",Appl Clin Inform,,550

We highlight the materials commonly utilized to deliver mRNA, their physicochemical characteristics, and other relevant considerations, such as mRNA optimization, routes of administration, cellular fate, and immune activation, that are important for successful mRNA vaccination. We also examine the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines currently in clinical trials. mRNA vaccines are ready for the clinic, showing tremendous promise in the COVID-19 vaccine race, and have pushed the boundaries of gene therapy.","Kim, Jeonghwan; Eygeris, Yulia; Gupta, Mohit; Sahay, Gaurav",Adv Drug Deliv Rev,,550
334267,Mental health consequences during the initial stage of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) in Spain,2020,"PURPOSE: Patients hospitalized for infection with SARS-CoV-2 typically present with pneumonia. The respiratory failure is frequently complicated by pulmonary embolism in segmental pulmonary arteries. The distribution of pulmonary embolism in regard to lung parenchymal opacifications has not been investigated yet. METHODS: All patients with COVID-19 treated at a medical intensive care unit between March 8th and April 15th, 2020 undergoing computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) were included. All CTPA were assessed by two radiologists independently in respect to parenchymal changes and pulmonary embolism on a lung segment basis. RESULTS: Out of 22 patients with severe COVID-19 treated within the observed time period, 16 (age 60.4 ± 10.2 years, 6 female SAPS2 score 49.2 ± 13.9) underwent CT. A total of 288 lung segment were analyzed. Thrombi were detectable in 9/16 (56.3%) patients, with 4.4 ± 2.9 segments occluded per patient and 40/288 (13.9%) segments affected in the whole cohort. Patients with thrombi had significantly worse segmental opacifications in CT (p < 0.05) and all thrombi were located in opacitated segments. There was no correlation between d-dimer level and number of occluded segmental arteries. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombi in segmental pulmonary arteries are common in COVID-19 and are located in opacitated lung segments. This might suggest local clot formation.","Mueller-Peltzer, Katharina; Krauss, Tobias; Benndorf, Matthias; Lang, Corinna N; Bamberg, Fabian; Bode, Christoph; Duerschmied, Daniel; Staudacher, Dawid L; Zotzmann, Viviane",Respir Med,,550

As this virus spread rapidly, it became a matter of time before many countries began to implement measures to try and contain the spread of the disease. COVID-19 as it is referred to, resulted in two main approaches to fighting the viral pandemic, either through a progressive set of measures to slow down the number of identified cases designed to ‘flatten the curve’ over time (anticipated to be at least six months), or to attack it by the severest of measures including a total lock-down and/or herding exposure to fast track ‘immunisation’ while we await a vaccine. The paper reports the findings from the first phase of an ongoing survey designed to identify the changing patterns in travel activity of Australian residents as a result of the stage 2 restrictions imposed by the Australian government. The main restrictions, in addition to social distancing of at least 1.5 m, are closure of entry to Australia (except residents returning), and closure of non-essential venues such as night clubs, restaurants, mass attendee sporting events, churches, weddings, and all social gatherings in any circumstance. With some employers encouraging working from home and others requiring it, in addition to job losses, and many children attending school online from home, the implications on travel activity is extreme. We identify the initial impacts associated with the first month of stricter social distancing measures introduced in Australia.","Beck, Matthew J.; Hensher, David A.",Transp. Policy,,550
334790,Immunosuppressive therapies for alopecia areata during COVID-19: A cross-sectional survey study,2021,"Various approaches to anatomical education were explored at Sidney Kimmel Medical College (SKMC) during the Covid19 pandemic. Students in the class 2023 were able to evaluate three approaches: i) in-person dissection (prior to the pandemic) using Virtual Human Dissector as a reference guide, ii) virtual dissection using Visible Body Courseware supplemented with Acland's Video Atlas, and iii) faculty-guided review of prosections combined with opportunities for virtual dissection. Zhang's ?in house? dissection videos were also provided to the class of 2023 throughout their training. A survey was conducted to sample students? perspectives regarding these learning modalities, and 65/260 students responded. Sixty (60%) percent considered the in-person dissection most ideal, whereas 40% thought that approaches using Visible Body, with or without prosections (20% each) as the most effective approach. Of the supplemental learning resources, 47% selected Acland's Video Atlas, 37% Zhang's in-house dissection videos, and 12% the Visible Body as most helpful. Moore's Clinical Oriented Anatomy is the required textbook in our course. Surprisingly, 57% of students responding to the survey did not read it, 25% only rarely read it, and 16% read it only when they looked for answers to specific questions. Only 2% of the class read most of the chapters in this textbook. When asked for a recommendation for future anatomy education, 67% of students advised hands-on dissection combined with prosection and 16% advised hands-on dissection only. Interestingly, 18% of the students responding advised approaches that omit in-person hands-on dissection. In summary, the traditional in-person cadaveric dissection is still considered the most effective learning approach by the majority of students at SKMC, but students who do not prefer in-person hands-on dissection should be taken into consideration. In the future, a more comprehensive and hybrid curricular approach will be considered to facilitate the learning of students with different learning styles.","Zhang, Guiyun Tomatsu Shiori",The FASEB Journal,,550

However, not all of this damage is attributable to the disease itself; much of it has occurred due to the prevailing misinformation around COVID-19. This rapid integrative review will draw on knowledge from the literature about misinformation during previous abrupt large-scale infectious disease outbreaks to enable policymakers, governments and health institutions to proactively mitigate the spread and effect of misinformation. Subject and methods: For this rapid integrative review, we systematically searched MEDLINE and Google Scholar and extracted the literature on misinformation during abrupt large-scale infectious disease outbreaks since 2000. We screened articles using predetermined inclusion criteria. We followed an updated methodology for integrated reviews and adjusted it for our rapid review approach. Results: We found widespread misinformation in all aspects of large-scale infectious disease outbreaks since 2000, including prevention, treatment, risk factor, transmission mode, complications and vaccines. Conspiracy theories also prevailed, particularly involving vaccines. Misinformation most frequently has been reported regarding Ebola, and women and youth are particularly vulnerable to misinformation. A lack of scientific knowledge by individuals and a lack of trust in the government increased the consumption of misinformation, which is disseminated quickly by the unregulated media, particularly social media. Conclusion: This review identified the nature and pattern of misinformation during large-scale infectious disease outbreaks, which could potentially be used to address misinformation during the ongoing COVID-19 or any future pandemic.","Chowdhury, Nashit; Khalid, Ayisha; Turin, Tanvir C",Z Gesundh Wiss,,550

The so-called videoconferencing became one of the accepted ways of the hearings. This kind of videoconferencing took place on online videoconference solutions, which differ a lot from the conventional videoconference systems. After the exceptional situation, it remained a question whether the digital revolution of court proceedings had arrived or the use of videoconferencing should remain an exceptional instrument. The application of a videoconference system is the subject of the right to a fair trial, in this regard it has been contested by the European Court of Human Rights in several cases. This case law stated several expectations and reveals many aspects, which have to be applied to the online videoconference solutions. On the other hand, the wider use of legal tech instruments is the subject of the political will. The political support is crystallizing within the EU, whose right to act is limited. The interim measures which were introduced under the emergency law regimes on national level show a number of experiences on how the continuous and legally founded functioning of the justice system can be ensured, for example by the use of online video hearings. The balance between the effectivity and the legality is a crucial question. Upon the above-mentioned sources, the paper introduces the differences of the two methods of videoconferencing. It examines the legal requirements, details the experiences and shows the opportunities of the use of videoconference systems and online videoconference solutions in civil cases. The use of videoconference in civil hearings can be an instrument conforming to procedural right. The general application of videoconference, especially the online solution lowers the threshold to access the justice, accelerates the procedures, ensures social distancing, but requires both legal and technical preparedness.","Fekete, Gábor L.

METHODS: We surveyed internal medicine (IM) and family medicine (FM) faculty and residents to ascertain satisfaction or concerns with the change to telehealth from in-person visits. RESULTS: Of patients surveyed (129 IM, 94 FM), 84.4% of IM patients and 94% of FM patients agreed or strongly agreed that they enjoyed the televisits, and 82.9% of IM providers (47 surveyed) and 64% of FM providers (25 surveyed) felt the same. For continued televisits, 76.74% of IM patients and 84.1% of FM patients agreed or strongly agreed that they would not mind having virtual visits after the pandemic, compared with 89.44% of IM providers and 88% of FM providers, and 91% of IM providers and 88% of FM providers felt comfortable managing visits virtually. CONCLUSION: Patients are open to the expanded use of telemedicine, and providers and hospital systems should be prepared to embrace it for the benefit of patient care.","Volcy, Judith; Smith, Walkitria; Mills, Krystal; Peterson, Ashley; Kene-Ewulu, Ijeoma; McNair, Macy; Kelsey, Riba; Mbaezue, Nkechi",J Am Board Fam Med,,550

We explored whether UK residents with more frequent or supportive social contact had fewer depressive symptoms during March-August 2020, and potential factors moderating the relationship. METHODS: A convenience sample of UK dwelling participants aged â©¾18 in the internet-based longitudinal COVID-19 Social Study completed up to 22 weekly questionnaires about face-to-face and phone/video social contact frequency, perceived social support, and depressive symptoms using the PHQ-9. Mixed linear models examined associations between social contact and support, and depressive symptoms. We examined for interaction by empathic concern, perspective taking and pre-COVID social contact frequency. RESULTS: In 71 117 people with mean age 49 years (standard deviation 15), those with high perceived social support scored 1.836 (1.801-1.871) points lower on PHQ-9 than those with low support. Daily face-to-face or phone/video contact was associated with lower depressive symptoms (0.258 (95% confidence interval 0.225-0.290) and 0.117 (0.080-0.154), respectively) compared to no contact. The negative association between social relationships and depressive symptoms was stronger for those with high empathic concern, perspective taking and usual sociability. CONCLUSIONS: We found during lockdown that those with higher quality or more face-to-face or phone/video contact had fewer depressive symptoms. Contact quality was more strongly associated than quantity. People who were usually more sociable or had higher empathy had more depressive symptoms during enforced reduced contact. The results have implications for COVID-19 and potential future pandemic management, and for understanding the relationship between social factors and mental health.","Sommerlad, Andrew; Marston, Louise; Huntley, Jonathan; Livingston, Gill; Lewis, Gemma; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",Psychol Med,,550

Overall, there has been a generalized lack of appropriateness in prescriptions, which, in the field of transfusion medicine, is termed patient-blood management. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to separate study design variables that could affect clinical outcome after CCP therapy. We focus here on variables such as pretransfusion antibody testing in recipients, dose adjustments and antibody affinity measurements. SOURCES: We searched PubMed and preprint servers for relevant preclinical and clinical studies discussing each of these variables in the field of CCP therapy. CONTENT: We show evidence that neglecting those variables has affected the outcomes of the vast majority of CCP clinical trials to date. IMPLICATIONS: A better understanding of such variables will improve the design of the next generation of CCP clinical trials. This will likely lead to better clinical outcomes and will minimize risks of immune evasion from subneutralizing doses of neutralizing antibodies.","Focosi, Daniele; Maggi, Fabrizio; Franchini, Massimo; Aguzzi, Adriano; Lanza, Maria; Mazzoni, Alessandro; Menichetti, Francesco",Clin. microbiol. infect,,550

We dubbed those solutions as the compensated/uncompensated strings. The compensated string is similar to the conventional cosmic string in the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) string, around which only the would-be Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson winds. Around the uncompensated string, on the other hand, the physical NG boson also winds, where the physical NG boson is associated with the spontaneous breaking of the enhanced symmetry. Our previous simulation in the 2+1 dimensional spacetime confirmed that both the compensated/uncompensated strings are formed at the phase transition of the symmetry breaking. Non-trivial winding of the physical NG boson around the strings potentially causes the so-called axion domain-wall problem when the model is applied to the axion model. In this paper, we perform simulation in the 3+1 dimensional spacetime to discuss the fate of the uncompensated strings. We observe that the evolution of the string-network is highly complicated in the 3+1 dimensional simulation compared with that seen in the previous simulation. Despite such complications, we find that the number of the uncompensated strings which could cause can be highly suppressed at late times. Our observation suggests that the present setup can be applied to the axion model without suffering from the axion domain-wall problem.","Hiramatsu, Takashi; Ibe, Masahiro; Suzuki, Motoo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10421v1.pdf,550

SidA is an N-monooxygenase that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent hydroxylation of L-ornithine through a multistep oxidative mechanism, utilizing a C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate. Here we present four new crystal structures of SidA in various redox- and ligation states, including the first structure of oxidized SidA without NADP(H) or L-ornithine bound (resting state). The resting state structure reveals a new ""out"" active site conformation characterized by large rotations of the FAD isoalloxazine around the C1'-C2' and N10-C1' bonds, coupled to a 10 Å movement of the Tyr-loop. Additional structures show that either flavin reduction or the binding of NADP(H) is sufficient to drive the FAD to the ""in"" conformation. The structures also reveal protein conformational changes associated with the binding of NADP(H) and L-ornithine. Some of these residues were probed using site-directed mutagenesis. Docking was used to explore the active site of the ""out"" conformation. These calculations identified two potential ligand-binding sites. Altogether, our results provide new information about conformational dynamics in flavin-dependent monooxygenases. Understanding the different active site conformations that appear during the catalytic cycle may allow fine tuning of inhibitor discovery efforts.","Campbell, Ashley C; Stiers, Kyle M; Martin Del Campo, Julia S; Mehra-Chaudhary, Ritcha; Sobrado, Pablo; Tanner, John J",J. biol. chem,,550

We aimed to assess patient satisfaction with the virtual clinic format. Method: Patients who underwent virtual consultation were contacted by phone and surveyed about their appointment. Convenience, thoroughness, satisfaction, preference and reason for appointment were assessed via questionnaire Results: 77 randomly selected patients were contacted. 63 males (82%), 14 females (18%). Median age 61 years (range 16-86). 62 (80%) reviews, 12 (16%) new referrals, and 3 (4%) post-operative patients were surveyed. 55 (71%) were booked for repeat appointment, 13 (17%) for further investigations, 6 (8%) discharged, and 3 (4%) listed for surgery. 73 (95%) found it convenient, 3 (4%) were neutral and 1 (1%) found it inconvenient. 74 (96%) felt thoroughly assessed and 76 (99%) of patients had all their concerns addressed. 74 (96%) were satisfied with their review, 2 (3%) were neutral, and 1 (1%) was dissatisfied. Going forward, 50 (65%) would prefer virtual follow-up and 27 (35%) would prefer an inperson review. Conclusions: Virtual clinic is preferable to the majority of patients in our urology service and is deemed convenient, thorough and satisfactory by them.

by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) has been a major cause of morbidity and mortality around the world Thirteen million cases have been diagnosed with approximately 570,000 deaths worldwide COVID-19 is associated with ischemia, myocarditis and eventual resulting arrhythmia Cases may present as acute thrombotic occlusion, stress cardiomyopathy, or coronary spasm Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was temporarily approved by FDA for COVID-19 treatment In this study, we planned to characterize the risk and degree of QTc prolongation in largely African-American population in central Brooklyn, who were hospitalized with COVID-19 infection in association with inpatient administration of HCQ and azithromycin One of the major adverse drug effects of HCQ and chloroquine is the potential prolongation of corrected QT interval (QTc) Methods: In our retrospective study, we included patients, both males and females, 18 years of age and older who were admitted at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York, for COVID-19 infection and were treated with hydroxychloroquine Native baseline RR, QRS, and QT intervals were measured before administering the first dose of hydroxychloroquine and within 24 h of administration The RR interval was measured as a distance between the peak of the R-wave and the peak of the previous R-wave in the same lead in milliseconds and converted to a heart rate by equation, 60,000/RR For correction of the QT, we used common formulas: QTc = QT/√RR [Bazett formula], QTc = QT/∛RR [Fridericia formula], QTc = QT + 0 154 (1-RR) [Framingham formula], QTc = QT + 1 75 (heart rate-60) [Hodges formula] QTc interval prolongation was defined based on the following rules: Male Rules: 1) Baseline 450 ms;2) &gt;15% increase over baseline post HCQ;and 3) baseline &gt;450 ms and 500 ms;Female Rules: 1) Baseline 470 ms;2) &gt;15% increase over baseline post HCQ;and 3) baseline &gt;470 ms and 500 ms Statistics: Means were compared using independent sample t-tests;paired sample t-tests and proportions were compared using Chi square analysis QT correction formulas were compared using 1-way ANOVA and post hoc analysis was done with Tukey correction Binary univariate and multivariate regression were performed to determine risk factor predictors for QTc prolongation Results: We screened 444 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to our hospital between March 10 and April 15, 2020, a total of 247 were excluded from this study because they met the exclusion criteria Thus, 197 patients were included in the analysis The mean baseline QTc interval calculated using the Bazett, Hodges, Frederica, Framingham methods were 451 0 ± 34 3, 425 1 ± 28 9, 417 2 ± 34 0, and 413 9 ± 31 ms, respectively Of the 4 correction methods, 35 5% of all patients met the criteria for prolongation using the Bazett method Of all patients included in the study 125 (63 5%) were male and 72 (36 5%) were female Subjects were predominantly African American ancestry, 179 (90 9%) The mean age of all patients was 66 1 ± 13 3 years The most common comorbidities were hypertension (74 6%), diabetes (55 3%), and hyperlipidemia (37 5%) Of all study participants, 91 7% received concomitant azithromycin;31% of patients were on home beta-blocker therapy, while 27 9% were on home calcium-channel blockers Of baseline electrocardiograms, 87 8% were sinus rhythm Total number of patients meeting prolongation criteria was less using the Hodges, Frederica, and Framingham methods Mean QTc values in both genders are presented in (Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4) All 4 methods showed statistically significant increases in QTc Bazett had the relatively largest difference between pre- and post-therapy QT interval with a mean difference of 14 48 ms The increase was present in both men and women The mean difference across sexes was largest using the Bazett method 16 43, bu this was not statistically significant Univariate analysis across all methods found that the concomitant use of azithromycin was not a significant predictor in QT prolongation across the Bazett, Hodges, Frederica, and Framingham methods However, the presence of coronary artery disease was a statistically significant predictor for QT prolongation The presence of congestive heart failure was also a predictor using the Hodges and Framingham methods (Table 5, 6, 7, and 8) (Figure 1) [Formula presented] ANOVA analysis across all subjects showed a significant difference between the four methods There were significant differences between Bazett and 3 methods The largest difference was between Bazett and Framingham, by 37 12 s There was also a smaller difference between the Hodge and Framingham methods The significant difference between the Bazzett method and the others also persisted across both men and women The difference between Hodges and Bazzett was only significant in men (Table 9, 10, and 11) QT prolongation irrespective of the method used for correction did not predict mortality [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Conclusion: It was notable that the longest QTc prolongation seen in this study was only 14 48 ms, using the Bazett formula With other formulas, this prolongation was significantly smaller and so was the proportion of patients meeting QTc prolongation criteria Not surprisingly, the Bazett formula again overestimated extend of QT prolongation We can only speculate that the differences are perhaps related to the fact that our population was nearly exclusively African American Common channels variation has been well documented to be a factor in QT prolongation, including drug-inducted QT prolongation In the African-American ethnic subgroup, Ser1103Tyr-SCN5A is seen in approximately 8 % of population and can certainly explain our data Furthermore, frequency of CAD and CHF was slightly higher than reported in other studies and both entities were associated with QT prolongation on our population

Specifically, we aimed to evaluate how the relative growth of COVID-19 cases and deaths would have differed if all states had issued a mandate to mask in public by September 1, 2020 versus if all states had delayed issuing such a mandate. To do so, we applied the Causal Roadmap, a formal framework for causal and statistical inference. The outcome was defined as the state-specific relative increase in cumulative cases and in cumulative deaths {21, 30, 45, 60}-days after September 1. Despite the natural experiment in state-level masking policies, the causal effect of interest was not identifiable. Nonetheless, we specified the target statistical parameter as the adjusted rate ratio (aRR): the expected outcome with early implementation divided by the expected outcome with delayed implementation, after adjusting for state-level confounders. To minimize strong estimation assumptions, primary analyses used targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) with Super Learner. After 60-days and at a national-level, early implementation was associated 9% reduction in new COVID-19 cases (aRR: 0.91; 95%CI: 0.88-0.95) and a 16% reduction in new COVID-19 deaths (aRR: 0.84; 95%CI: 0.76-0.93). Although lack of identifiability prohibited causal interpretations, application of the Causal Roadmap facilitated estimation and inference of statistical associations, providing timely answers to pressing questions in the COVID-19 response.","Wong, Angus K.; Balzer, Laura B.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06115v1.pdf,550

352922,Unprecedented need and recommendations for harnessing data to guide future policy and practice for opioid use disorder treatment following COVID-19,2020,"Federalism has complicated the US response to the novel coronavirus. States' actions to address the pandemic have varied widely, and federal and state officials have provided conflicting messages. This fragmented approach has surely cost time and lives. Federalism will shape the long-term health and economic impacts of COVID-19, including plans for the future, for at least two reasons: First, federalism exacerbates inequities, as some states have a history of underinvesting in social programs, especially in certain communities. Second, many of the states with the deepest needs are poorly equipped to respond to emergencies due to low taxes and distrust of government, leading to inadequate infrastructure. These dynamics are not new, but they have been laid bare by this crisis. What can policy makers do to address the inequities in health and economic outcomes that federalism intensifies? The first section of this article offers a case study of the Mississippi Delta to illustrate the role of federalism in perpetuating the connection between place, health, and economics. The second section examines challenges that safety net programs will face when moving beyond the acute phase of COVID-19. The final section explores near-, middle-, and long-term policy options to mitigate federalism's harmful side effects.","Huberfeld, Nicole; Gordon, Sarah H; Jones, David K",J Health Polit Policy Law,,550
353250,Mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on tuberculosis and HIV services: A cross-sectional survey of 669 health professionals in 64 low and middle-income countries,2021,"The burden of global childhood cancer lies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Communication is essential to pediatric cancer care, and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has defined 6 functions of communication between patients, family members, and providers, including 1) fostering healing relationships, 2) responding to emotions, 3) exchanging information, 4) making decisions, 5) managing uncertainty, and 6) enabling self-management. Nevertheless, communication needs and practices in LMICs remain incompletely understood. For this review, the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Turning Research Into Practice databases were searched according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews. Searching identified 2988 articles, with 11 added through snowballing. Forty articles met the inclusion criteria. Two reviewers extracted data on study characteristics, communication functions, enablers, barriers, and additional major themes. This review included work from 17 countries. Most studies (85%) used qualitative methodology; the number of participants ranged from 7 to 304. All 6 of the NCI-defined communication functions were identified in included studies, with rates ranging from 100% of studies for information exchange to 28% of studies for decision making. Communication barriers included cancer misconceptions, stigma, and hierarchy between parents and providers. Provider training and community education facilitated communication. Additional themes included disclosure to children, family dynamics, and the multidisciplinary health care team. In conclusion, all 6 of the communication functions defined by the NCI were applied by pediatric cancer researchers in LMICs. Additional barriers, enablers, and communication themes noted in LMICs deserve further exploration, and a relative paucity of research in comparison with high-income countries highlights the need for further work.","Graetz, Dylan E; Garza, Marcela; Rodriguez-Galindo, Carlos; Mack, Jennifer W",Cancer,,550

It is used to extend the shelf-life of a product by not adversely affecting its nutritive parameters. Scope and approach The present review deals with the current understanding of the effect of ionizing and non-ionizing radiations on different properties of fruits and vegetables. Conclusions Studies have revealed the positive effects of irradiation on physical and nutritional properties of different fruits and vegetables followed by significant reduction in microbial load during storage. Food irradiation can be seen as a promising, safe and well-established technology but still underutilized at large scale. The buying behaviour of consumers poses a significant challenge with innovating food processing technologies like food irradiation. Thus, on the basis of the current review, scientific proofs of irradiated food safety is still needed and work needs to be accomplished to increase technological appeal for food safety. Data collected from existing studies revealed that UV-C has the potential to be proved better than other preservation techniques at an acceptable dose that can be helpful in maintaining the desirable quality, enhancing the nutritive value of product during storage and has the efficacy of eliminating COVID-19.","Bisht, Bhawna Bhatnagar Pooja Gururani Prateek Kumar Vinod Tomar Mahipal Singh Sinhmar Rajat Rathi Nitika Kumar Sanjay",Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology,,550
356619,"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on medical staff in Guangdong, China: a cross-sectional study",2020,"BACKGROUND: Despite the ongoing spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), knowledge about factors affecting prolonged viral excretion is limited. METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively collected data from 99 hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between 19 January and 17 February 2020 in Zhejiang Province, China. We classified them into 2 groups based on whether the virus test results eventually became negative. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate factors associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shedding. RESULTS: Among 99 patients, 61 patients had SARS-CoV-2 clearance (virus-negative group), but 38 patients had sustained positive results (virus-positive group). The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 excretion was 15 (interquartile range, 12-19) days among the virus-negative patients. The shedding time was significantly increased if the fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA test result was positive. Male sex (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .35-.98]), immunoglobulin use (HR, 0.42 [95% CI, .24-.76]), APACHE II score (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, .84-.96]), and lymphocyte count (HR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.05-3.1]) were independent factors associated with a prolonged duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding. Antiviral therapy and corticosteroid treatment were not independent factors. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance time was associated with sex, disease severity, and lymphocyte function. The current antiviral protocol and low-to-moderate dosage of corticosteroid had little effect on the duration of viral excretion.","Shi, Ding; Wu, Wenrui; Wang, Qing; Xu, Kaijin; Xie, Jiaojiao; Wu, Jingjing; Lv, Longxian; Sheng, Jifang; Guo, Jing; Wang, Kaicen; Fang, Daiqiong; Li, Yating; Li, Lanjuan",J Infect Dis,,550

This study investigated whether the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity findings for SAR-Asp versus NN-Asp, observed over 6 months in people with type 1 (n = 497) or type 2 diabetes (n = 100) treated with multiple daily injections in combination with insulin glargine (Lantus®), are maintained after 12 months. Materials and Methods: GEMELLI 1 was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 3 study. Participants completing the initial 6-month treatment period continued on SAR-Asp or NN-Asp, as randomized, for a 6-month safety extension. Results: Of the 597 participants randomized, 264 out of 301 (87.7%) and 263 out of 296 (88.9%) assigned to SAR-Asp and NN-Asp, respectively, completed 12 months of treatment. Improved glycemic control was sustained at 12 months in both treatment groups, with similar least-squares mean reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline (SAR-Asp: -0.25%; NN-Asp: -0.26%). Fasting plasma glucose and seven-point self-monitored plasma glucose profile changes, including postprandial glucose excursions, and changes in mealtime and basal insulin dosages were similar between groups. Safety and tolerability, including anti-insulin aspart antibodies (AIAs; incidence, prevalence, titers, cross-reactivity to human insulin), neutralizing antibodies (incidence, prevalence), hypoglycemia, and treatment-emergent adverse events (including hypersensitivity events and injection site reactions), were similar between groups. No relationship was observed between maximum individual AIA titers and change in HbA1c or insulin dose, hypoglycemia, or hypersensitivity reactions or between efficacy/safety measures and subgroups by presence or absence of treatment-emergent AIA. Conclusions: SAR-Asp and NN-Asp demonstrated similar efficacy and safety (including immunogenicity) in people with diabetes over 12 months of treatment.","Garg, Satish K; Wernicke-Panten, Karin; Wardecki, Marek; Kramer, Daniel; Delalande, Francois; Franek, Edward; Sadeharju, Karita; Monchamp, Travis; Miossec, Patrick; Mukherjee, Bhaswati; Shah, Viral N",Diabetes Technol Ther,,550

359559,"Frontline Healthcare Workers’ Knowledge, Perception and Risk Prevention Practices Regarding COVID-19 in Afghanistan: A Cross-Sectional Study",2021,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 disease, spreading all around the world and causing a worldwide pandemic, has lead to the collapse of the health systems of the most affected countries. Due to the ease of transmission, early prevention measures are proved to be fundamental to control the pandemic and, hence, the saturation of the health systems. Given the difficulty of obtaining characteristics of these systems of different countries and regions, it is necessary to define indicators based on basic information that enable the assessment of the evolution of the impact of a disease in a health system along with fair comparisons among different ones. This present paper introduces the Health Sufficiency Indicator (HSI), in its accumulated and daily versions. This indicator measures the additional pressure that a health care system has to deal with due to a pandemic. Hence, it allows to evaluate the capacity of a health system to give response to the corresponding needs arising from a pandemic and to compare the evolution of the disease among different regions. In addition, the Potential Occupancy Ratio (POR) in both its hospital ward bed and ICU bed versions is here introduced to asses the impact of the pandemic in the capacity of hospitals. These indicators and other well-known ones are applied to track the evolution of the impact of the disease on the Spanish health system during the first wave of the pandemic, both on national and regional levels. An international comparison among the most affected countries is also performed.","Moguerza, Javier M; Perelló Oliver, Salvador; Martín de Diego, Isaac; Aceña, Víctor; Lancho, Carmen; Cuesta, Marina; González Fernández, César",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,550

363047,Factors associated with the mental health status of medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study in Japan,2020,"BACKGROUND: With the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, rapid diagnostics are paramount to contain the current pandemic. The routinely used realtime RT-PCR is sensitive, specific and able to process large batches of samples. However, turnaround time is long and in cases where fast obtained results are critical, molecular point of care tests (POCT) can be an alternative. Here we report on a multicenter evaluation of the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test. STUDY DESIGN: The Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay was evaluated against the routine in-house real-time RT-PCR assays in three medical microbiology laboratories in The Netherlands. A sensitivity and specificity panel was tested consisting of a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 and ten samples containing SARS-CoV-2 and a range of other seasonal respiratory viruses. Additionally, 58 samples of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 with different viral loads and 30 tested negative samples in all three Dutch laboratories using an in-house RT-PCR, were evaluated using Cepheids Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridges. RESULTS: Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point of care test showed equal performance compared to routine in-house testing with a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.26 copies/mL. Other seasonal respiratory viruses were not detected. In clinical samples Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 reaches an agreement of 100 % compared to all in-house RT-PCRs CONCLUSION: Cepheids GeneXpert Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 is a valuable addition for laboratories in situations where rapid and accurate diagnostics are of the essence.","Wolters, Femke; van de Bovenkamp, Jeroen; van den Bosch, Bart; van den Brink, Sharon; Broeders, Maaike; Chung, Ngoc Hoa; Favié, Barbara; Goderski, Gabriel; Kuijpers, Judith; Overdevest, Ilse; Rahamat-Langedoen, Janette; Wijsman, Lisa; Melchers, Willem Jg; Meijer, Adam",J Clin Virol,,550

A bibliografia de apoio fundamenta os argumentos. Compreende-se a desigualdade socioespacial como processo e condição estrutural de um território marcado por vulnerabilidades herdadas e atualizadas, resultante da relação de exploração, espoliação e opressão no atual período da globalização. Argumenta-se que a pandemia da COVID-19 pode ter repercussões mais graves em contextos de maior desigualdade socioespacial, com aprofundamento sistêmico e duradouro das crises econômica e social nos lugares. Contudo, as ações importam, incluindo as articulações entre diversos grupos, instituições e setores. A análise da situação geográfica contribui para a compreensão do território herdado e das diferentes experiências da COVID-19 indissociavelmente das condições e dos sentidos da ação frente à pandemia, em cada lugar.

363680,Exploring depressive symptoms and its associates among Bangladeshi older adults amid COVID-19 pandemic: findings from a cross-sectional study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Numerous clinical trials and observational studies have investigated various pharmacological agents as potential treatment for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the results are heterogeneous and sometimes even contradictory to one another, making it difficult for clinicians to determine which treatments are truly effective. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We carried out a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to systematically evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions and the level of evidence behind each treatment regimen in different clinical settings. Both published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and confounding-adjusted observational studies which met our predefined eligibility criteria were collected. We included studies investigating the effect of pharmacological management of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 management. Mild patients who do not require hospitalization or have self-limiting disease courses were not eligible for our NMA. A total of 110 studies (40 RCTs and 70 observational studies) were included. PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, medRxiv, SSRN, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from the beginning of 2020 to August 24, 2020. Studies from Asia (41 countries, 37.2%), Europe (28 countries, 25.4%), North America (24 countries, 21.8%), South America (5 countries, 4.5%), and Middle East (6 countries, 5.4%), and additional 6 multinational studies (5.4%) were included in our analyses. The outcomes of interest were mortality, progression to severe disease (severe pneumonia, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), and/or mechanical ventilation), viral clearance rate, QT prolongation, fatal cardiac complications, and noncardiac serious adverse events. Based on RCTs, the risk of progression to severe course and mortality was significantly reduced with corticosteroids (odds ratio (OR) 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.86, p = 0.032, and OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.91, p = 0.002, respectively) and remdesivir (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.50, p < 0.001, and OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.98, p = 0.041, respectively) compared to standard care for moderate to severe COVID-19 patients in non-ICU; corticosteroids were also shown to reduce mortality rate (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.73, p < 0.001) for critically ill patients in ICU. In analyses including observational studies, interferon-alpha (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.39, p = 0.004), itolizumab (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.92, p = 0.042), sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.88, p = 0.030), anakinra (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.82, p = 0.019), tocilizumab (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.60, p < 0.001), and convalescent plasma (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.96, p = 0.038) were associated with reduced mortality rate in non-ICU setting, while high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.49, p = 0.003), ivermectin (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.57, p = 0.005), and tocilizumab (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.90, p = 0.012) were associated with reduced mortality rate in critically ill patients. Convalescent plasma was the only treatment option that was associated with improved viral clearance rate at 2 weeks compared to standard care (OR 11.39, 95% CI 3.91 to 33.18, p < 0.001). The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was shown to be associated with increased QT prolongation incidence (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.20, p = 0.003) and fatal cardiac complications in cardiac-impaired populations (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.24 to 4.00, p = 0.007). No drug was significantly associated with increased noncardiac serious adverse events compared to standard care. The quality of evidence of collective outcomes were estimated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. The major limitation of the present study is the overall low level of evidence that reduces the certainty of recommendations. Besides, the risk of bias (RoB) measured by RoB2 and ROBINS-I framework for individual studies was generally low to moderate. The outcomes deducted from observational studies could not infer causality and can only imply associations. The study protocol is publicly available on PROSPERO (CRD42020186527). CONCLUSIONS: In this NMA, we found that anti-inflammatory agents (corticosteroids, tocilizumab, anakinra, and IVIG), convalescent plasma, and remdesivir were associated with improved outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Hydroxychloroquine did not provide clinical benefits while posing cardiac safety risks when combined with azithromycin, especially in the vulnerable population. Only 29% of current evidence on pharmacological management of COVID-19 is supported by moderate or high certainty and can be translated to practice and policy; the remaining 71% are of low or very low certainty and warrant further studies to establish firm conclusions.","Kim, Min Seo; An, Min Ho; Kim, Won Jun; Hwang, Tae-Ho",PLoS Med,,550
364222,Predictors of Staying at Home during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Social Lockdown based on Protection Motivation Theory: A Cross-Sectional Study in Japan,2020,"This study aims to explore the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of infant patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection. Clinical and epidemiological data of a 3-month-old patient with COVID-19 were collected, including general status, clinical results, laboratory tests, imaging characteristics, and epidemiological reports. The infant had no fever but had mild respiratory symptoms. The major laboratory results included normal white blood cell counts and lymphocytopenia, notably with elevated interleukin (IL-)-17A, IL-17 F, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-)-&#945;. The main manifestation of his chest computed tomography scan was pulmonary patchy shadows. All throat swabs and urine of the infant detected via Real-time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) were negative, but his anal swab continued to test positive up to 40 days after onset of illness. Our study indicated that infants infected with COVID-19 may have relatively mild symptoms or clinical signs, IL-17A, IL-17 F, and TNF-&#945; could be involved in the immune response of COVID-19. In addition, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) may shed through the gastrointestinal tract and convalescent carriers may exist among infant patients. We cannot rule out the possibility that infants may acquire infection from breastfeeding. Intensive care and nutrition support are recommended for infant patients with mild symptoms.","Wei, Yuehong; Liu, Xuexing; Yuan, Jun; Shi, Jie; Zhang, Xiao; Wang, Dahu; Zhang, Lin; Xie, Chaojun",IDCases,,550

Here, we highlight opportunities to broaden existing conservation economics frameworks that represent human behavior to include disease transmission in order to inform conservation-disease risk policy. Using examples from wildlife markets and forest extraction, we call for environment, resource, and development economists to develop and analyze empirically-grounded models of people's decisions about interacting with the environment, with particular attention to LMIC settings and ecological-epidemiological risk factors. Integrating the decisions that drive human-environment interactions with ecological and epidemiological research in an interdisciplinary approach to understanding pathogen transmission will inform policy needed to improve both conservation and disease spread outcomes.","Albers, Heidi J; Lee, Katherine D; Rushlow, Jennifer R; Zambrana-Torrselio, Carlos",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),,550

Given the limited resources, accurate patient triaging and care planning is critical in the fight against COVID-19, and one crucial task within care planning is determining if a patient should be admitted to a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU). Motivated by the need for transparent and trustworthy ICU admission clinical decision support, we introduce COVID-Net Clinical ICU, a neural network for ICU admission prediction based on patient clinical data. Driven by a transparent, trust-centric methodology, the proposed COVID-Net Clinical ICU was built using a clinical dataset from Hospital Sirio-Libanes comprising of 1,925 COVID-19 patients, and is able to predict when a COVID-19 positive patient would require ICU admission with an accuracy of 96.9% to facilitate better care planning for hospitals amidst the on-going pandemic. We conducted system-level insight discovery using a quantitative explainability strategy to study the decision-making impact of different clinical features and gain actionable insights for enhancing predictive performance. We further leveraged a suite of trust quantification metrics to gain deeper insights into the trustworthiness of COVID-Net Clinical ICU. By digging deeper into when and why clinical predictive models makes certain decisions, we can uncover key factors in decision making for critical clinical decision support tasks such as ICU admission prediction and identify the situations under which clinical predictive models can be trusted for greater accountability.","Chung, Audrey; Famouri, Mahmoud; Hryniowski, Andrew; Wong, Alexander",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06711v1.pdf,550

The purpose of the study was to examine factors associated with reducing smoking exposure during the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN: Cross-sectional design using the Health Belief Model to develop an online survey distributed throughout Ohio early during the outbreak. SAMPLE: 810 adults in Ohio (77.9% non-smokers, 22.1% current smokers). MEASUREMENTS: Sociodemographic factors, smoking and behavior changes since the COVID-19 outbreak, and perceived risk of infection were collected. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine factors associated with indoor smoking bans and factors associated with desire to quit smoking since the outbreak. RESULTS: For the overall sample, the odds of indoor smoking bans were significantly associated with never smoked, college education, single-family residence, not living with smokers, and perceived importance of avoiding public places. For smokers, the desire to quit smoking since the COVID-19 outbreak was associated with diabetes and perceived risk of severe infection. CONCLUSIONS: Identified factors inform residential smoking exposure reduction through indoor smoking bans. Having an increased perceived risk of severe infection among smokers may motivate cessation. Public health nurses can provide accurate and accessible resources for smoking cessation during the COVID-19 pandemic to promote healthy lifestyle modification.","Chertok, Ilana R Azulay",Public Health Nurs,,550

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of HCWs using questionnaires in February and March 2020 in Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran. We evaluated depression, stress, and anxiety levels using the DASS-21 questionnaire. Participants were selected by using census sampling. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.5.1. RESULTS: The study population included 217 HCWs (111 male, 116 female) and the mean age of the study group was 39.6 years old. Approximately two-thirds of the HCWs stayed in the hospital for 2-3 weeks. The mean scores of depression and stress were at a ""severe"" level, while anxiety scores were at an ""extremely severe"" level.

In this study, we aimed to assess the pandemic's effect on women's COVID-19-related publishing over the first year of the pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared the gender distribution of first authorships for 42 898 publications on COVID-19 from 1 February 2020 to 31 January 2021 to 483 232 publications appearing in the same journals during the same period the year prior. We found that the gender gap-the percentage of articles on which men versus women were first authors-widened by 14 percentage points during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite many pertinent research fields showing near equal proportions of men and women first authors publishing in the same fields before the pandemic. Longitudinal analyses revealed that the significant initial expansions of the gender gap began to trend backwards to expected values over time in many fields. As women may have been differentially affected depending on their geography, we also assessed the gender distribution of first authorships grouped by countries and geographical areas. While we observed a significant reduction of the shares of women first authors in almost all countries, longitudinal analyses confirmed a resolving trend over time. CONCLUSION: The reduction in women's COVID-19-related research output appears particularly concerning as many disciplines informing the response to the pandemic had near equal gender shares of first authorship in the year prior to the pandemic. The acute productivity drain with the onset of the pandemic magnifies deep-rooted obstacles on the way to gender equity in scientific contribution.","Lerchenmüller, Carolin; Schmallenbach, Leo; Jena, Anupam B; Lerchenmueller, Marc J",BMJ Open,,550

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and evaluate an information and communication strategy through a smartphone app with respect to childbirth, to facilitate informed choices for access to safer and evidence-based care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial, with 2 arms (intervention and control) and a closed, blind, parallel design, will be conducted with a smartphone app designed for behavior and opinion research in Brazil, with women of reproductive age previously registered on the app. After completing an entry questionnaire to verify the eligibility criteria and obtaining ethical consent, approximately 20,000 participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention and control groups at a 1:1 ratio. Participants allocated to the intervention group will be invited to engage in a digital information and communication strategy, which is designed to expand evidence-based knowledge on the advantages and disadvantages of options for labor and childbirth and the safety of the care processes. The information is based on the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization for a positive childbirth experience and has been updated to include the new challenges and disruptions in maternity care within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The control group will receive information regarding disposable and reusable diapers as a placebo intervention. The groups will be compared in their responses in generating the birth plan and the entry and exit questionnaires, regarding responses less or more aligned with the guidelines for a positive childbirth experience. A qualitative component to map information needs is included. RESULTS: The digital trial started recruiting participants in late October 2020, and data collection has been projected to be complete by December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This study will evaluate an innovative intervention that has the potential to promote better communication between women and providers, such that they can make better choices using an approach suitable for use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

385412,Development and validation of a questionnaire for assessing preventive practices and barriers among health care workers in COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a global burden, responsible for over 1 million deaths annually. The emergence and spread of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains (MDR-, XDR- and TDR-TB) is the main challenge in global TB-control, requiring the development of novel drugs acting on new biotargets, thus able to overcome the drug-resistance. Tryptanthrin is a natural alkaloid, with great therapeutic potential due to its simple way of synthesis and wide spectrum of biological activities including high bactericidal activity on both drug-susceptible and MDR M. tuberculosis strains. InhA was suggested as the target of tryptanthrins by in silico modeling, making it a promising alternative to isoniazid, able to overcome drug resistance provided by katG mutations. However, neither the mechanism of action of tryptanthrin nor the mechanism of resistance to tryptanthrins was ever confirmed in vitro. We show that the MmpS5-MmpL5 efflux system is able to provide resistance to tryptanthrins using an in-house test-system. Comparative genomic analysis of spontaneous tryptanthrin-resistant M. smegmatis mutants showed that mutations in MSMEG_1963 (EmbR transcriptional regulator) lead to a high-level resistance, while those in MSMEG_5597 (TetR transcriptional regulator) to a low-level one. Mutations in an MFS transporter gene (MSMEG_4427) were also observed, which might be involved in providing a basal level of tryptanthrins-resistance.","Frolova, Svetlana G.; Klimina, Ksenia M.; Kumar, Ravinder Vatlin Aleksey A.; Salunke, Deepak B.; Kendrekar, Pravin Danilenko Valery N.; Maslov, Dmitry A.",Antibiotics,,550

In March 2020, Italy shut down operations in selected sectors of its economy. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that municipalities with higher exposure to closed sectors experienced subsequently lower mortality rates. The implied life savings exceed 9,400 people over a period of less than a month. We also find that business closures exhibited rapidly diminishing returns and had large effects outside the closed businesses themselves, including spillovers to other municipalities. Overall, the results suggest business shutdowns are effective, but should be selectively implemented and centrally coordinated.","Bongaerts, Dion; Mazzola, Francesco; Wagner, Wolf",PLoS One,,550
386956,COVID-19 Discourse on Twitter in Four Asian Countries: Case Study of Risk Communication,2021,"Much has been written about WHO. Relatively little is known, however, about the organisation's evolving relationship with health-related personal beliefs, 'faith-based organisations' (FBOs), religious leaders and religious communities ('religious actors'). This article presents findings from a 4-year research project on the 'spiritual dimension' of health and WHO conducted at the University of Zürich. Drawing on archival research in Geneva and interviews with current and former WHO staff, consultants and programme partners, we identify three stages in this relationship. Although since its founding individuals within WHO occasionally engaged with religious actors, it was not until the 1970s, when the primary healthcare strategy was developed in consultation with the Christian Medical Commission, that their concerns began to influence WHO policies. By the early 1990s, the failure to roll out primary healthcare globally was accompanied by a loss of interest in religion within WHO. With the spread of HIV/AIDS however, health-related religious beliefs were increasingly recognised in the development of a major quality of life instrument by the Division of Mental Health, and the work of a WHO expert committee on cancer pain relief and the subsequent establishment of palliative care. While the 1990s saw a cooling off of activities, in the years since, the HIV/AIDS, Ebola and COVID-19 crises have periodically brought religious actors to the attention of the organisation. This study focusses on what we suggest may be understood as a trend towards a closer association between the activities of WHO and religious actors, which has occurred in fits and starts and is marked by attempts at institutional translation and periods of forgetting and remembering.","Winiger, Fabian; Peng-Keller, Simon",,,550
387561,All Eyes on Me,2020,"Chemical cross-linking was used to create nanocomposite hydrogels made up of gelatin (G) and borosilicate bioactive glass (BBG) with different content (0, 3, and 5 wt.%). The G/BBG nanocomposite hydrogels were studied for their morphology, mechanical properties, and viscoelasticity. SEM images revealed a macroporous interconnected structure with particles scattered across the pore walls. Studies of water absorption and degradation confirmed that the nanocomposite scaffolds were hydrophilic and biodegradable. The addition of 5% BBG to the scaffold formulations increased the compressive modulus by 413% and the compressive intensity by 20%, respectively. At all frequency ranges tested, the storage modulus (G′) was greater than the loss modulus (G″), revealing a self-standing elastic nanocomposite hydrogel. The nanocomposite scaffolds facilitated apatite formation while immersed in simulated body fluid (SBF). According to the findings, G/BBG nanocomposite scaffolds could be a promising biomaterial for bone regeneration.","Abd El-Aziz, Asmaa M.; Ahmed Abd, El-Fattah El-Maghraby Azza Ghareeb Doaa A.; Kandil, Sherif",Polymers,,550

Hypertension is the most common chronic disease in COVID-19 patients, but its impact on these patients has not been well described. In this retrospective study, 82 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled, and epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and therapy-related data were analyzed and compared between COVID-19 patients with (29 cases) or without (53 cases) hypertension. The median age of the included patients was 60.5 years, and the cohort included 49 women (59.8%) and 33 (40.2%) men. Hypertension (31 [28.2%]) was the most common chronic illness, followed by diabetes (16 [19.5%]) and cardiovascular disease (15 [18.3%]). The most common symptoms were fatigue (55 [67.1%]), dry cough (46 [56.1%]) and fever &#8805; 37.3 °C (46 [56.1%]). The median time from illness onset to positive RT-PCR test was 13.0 days (range 3-25 days). There were 6 deaths (20.7%) in the hypertension group and 5 deaths (9.4%) in the nonhypertension group, and more hypertensive patients with COVID-19 (8 [27.6%]) than nonhypertensive patients (2 [3.8%]) (P = 0.002) had at least one comorbid disease. Compared with nonhypertensive patients, hypertensive patients exhibited higher neutrophil counts, serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein, and NT-proBNP and lower lymphocyte counts and eGFR. Dynamic observations indicated more severe disease and poorer outcomes after hospital admission in the hypertension group. COVID-19 patients with hypertension have increased risks of severe inflammatory reactions, serious internal organ injury, and disease progression and deterioration.","Xia, Fei; Zhang, Mingwei; Cui, Bo; An, Wei; Chen, Min; Yang, Ping; Qin, Tao; Zhou, Xiaoyang; Liao, Yaling; Xu, Xin; Liu, Shiguo; Li, Kuangyu; Zhou, Qin; Wang, Keke; Hu, Guangxu; Du, Ming; Chen, Songrui; Zhang, Yafang; Wei, Wei; Xiang, Ming; Zhang, Jianjun",Sci Rep,,550

392699,"COVID-19 Pandemic: Shortage of Personal Protective Equipment, Use of Improvised Surrogates, and the Safety of Health Care Workers",2020,"BACKGROUND: Older adults at a higher risk of adverse outcomes and mortality if they get infected with Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2). These undesired outcomes are because ageing is associated with other conditions like multimorbidity, frailty and disability. This paper describes the impact of frailty on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) management and outcomes. We also try to point out the role of inflamm-ageing, immunosenescence and reduced microbiota diversity in developing a severe form of COVID-19 and a different response to COVID-19 vaccination among older frail adults. Additionally, we attempt to highlight the impact of frailty on intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes, and hence, the rationale behind using frailty as an exclusion criterion for critical care admission. Similarly, the importance of using a time-saving, validated, sensitive, and user-friendly tool for frailty screening in an acute setting as COVID-19 triage. We performed a narrative review. Publications from 1990 to March 2021 were identified by searching the electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL and SCOPUS. Based on this search, we have found that in older frail adults, many mechanisms contribute to the severity of COVID-19, particularly cytokine storm; those mechanisms include lower immunological capacity and status of ongoing chronic inflammation and reduced gut microbiota diversity. Higher degrees of frailty were associated with poor outcomes and higher mortality rates during and after ICU admission. Also, the response to COVID-19 vaccination among frail older adults might differ from the general population regarding effectiveness and side effects. Researches also had shown that there are many tools for identifying frailty in an acute setting that could be used in COVID-19 triage, and before ICU admission, the clinical frailty scale (CFS) was the most recommended tool. CONCLUSION: Older frail adults have a pre-existing immunopathological base that puts them at a higher risk of undesired outcomes and mortality due to COVID-19 and poor response to COVID-19 vaccination. Also, their admission in ICU should depend on their degree of frailty rather than their chronological age, which is better to be screened using the CFS.","Hussien, Hani; Nastasa, Andra; Apetrii, Mugurel; Nistor, Ionut; Petrovic, Mirko; Covic, Adrian",BMC Geriatr,,550

The data sets were obtained from the General Directorate of State Airports Authority (GDSA), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Turkish Airlines (THY). Since the pandemic became a serious issue for Turkey in March, 2020, the period from March until August 2020 is considered as being the pandemic period for the purpose of calculations. Comparisons were added to computations starting from January 2017. The percentage changes in the total pollutant amount on a monthly basis, induced by domestic flights in 2020 for the months of March, April, May, June, July and August were calculated to be −42.78%, −99.76%, −99.61, −73.27, −49.66% and −36.66%, respectively. Compared to the total amount of emissions of domestic traffic, the total amount of pollutants for international traffic did not increase in July and August. The increase in traffic on domestic flights in July and August 2020, along with the increase in demand for the tourism sector, did not reflect the same on international routes. The fact that part of the data obtained during the study is based on real evidence, and that some of it gives an average result through assumptions, indicates a serious decrease in the amount of pollutants as an undeniable fact.

Up to one-third of hospitalised patients develop severe pulmonary complications and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pulmonary outcomes following COVID-19 are unknown. METHODS: The Swiss COVID-19 lung study is a multicentre prospective cohort investigating pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19. We report on initial follow-up 4 months after mild/moderate or severe/critical COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization severity classification. RESULTS: 113 COVID-19 survivors were included (mild/moderate n=47, severe/critical n=66). We confirmed several comorbidities as risk factors for severe/critical disease. Severe/critical disease was associated with impaired pulmonary function, i.e. diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (D &lt;sub&gt;LCO&lt;/sub&gt;) % predicted, reduced 6-min walk distance (6MWD) and exercise-induced oxygen desaturation. After adjustment for potential confounding by age, sex and body mass index (BMI), patients after severe/critical COVID-19 had a D &lt;sub&gt;LCO&lt;/sub&gt; 20.9% pred (95% CI 12.4-29.4% pred, p=0.01) lower at follow-up. D &lt;sub&gt;LCO&lt;/sub&gt; % pred was the strongest independent factor associated with previous severe/critical disease when age, sex, BMI, 6MWD and minimal peripheral oxygen saturation at exercise were included in the multivariable model (adjusted odds ratio per 10% predicted 0.59, 95% CI 0. 37-0.87;p=0.01). Mosaic hypoattenuation on chest computed tomography at follow-up was significantly associated with previous severe/critical COVID-19 including adjustment for age and sex (adjusted OR 11.7, 95% CI 1.7-239;p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: 4 months after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, severe/critical COVID-19 was associated with significant functional and radiological abnormalities, potentially due to small-airway and lung parenchymal disease. A systematic follow-up for survivors needs to be evaluated to optimise care for patients recovering from COVID-19.","Guler, S. A.; Ebner, L.; Aubry-Beigelman, C.; Bridevaux, P.

The symptoms, their changes over the course in the cohort and in the different clinical types, etc. were illustrated. Differences in different periods and severities were analyzed through Chi square test, association with severity was analyzed through LASSO binomial logistic regression analysis. Inter-correlation and classification of symptoms were completed. Major symptoms were screened and their changes were illustrated. Results: A total of 43 symptoms with frequencies as 6067 in this cohort. Differences of symptoms in different stages and clinical types were significant. Expectoration, shortness of breath, dyspnea, diarrhea, poor appetite were positively but vomiting, waist discomfort, pharyngeal discomfort, acid reflux were negatively correlated with the combined-severe and critical type; dyspnea was correlated with the critical type. The 17 major symptoms were identified. The average daily frequency of symptoms per case was decreased continuously before the transition into the severe type and increased immediately one day before the transition and then decreased. It was decreased continuously before the transition date of the critical type and increased from the transition into the critical type to the next day and decreased thereafter. Dyspnea (P<0.001), shortness of breath (P<0.01) and chest distress (P<0.05) were correlated with death and their corresponding coefficient was 0.393, 0.258, 0.214, respectively. Conclusion: The symptoms of COVID-19 patients mainly related to upper respiratory tract infection, cardiopulmonary function, and digestive system. The mild type and the early stage in other types mainly related to upper respiratory tract infection. The cardiopulmonary function and digestive system associated symptoms were found in all other types and stages. Dyspnea was correlated with critical type, and dyspnea, shortness of breath and chest distress were correlated with death. Respiratory dysfunction (or incompleteness) associated symptoms were the characteristic symptoms. The changes of symptoms did not synchronously with the changes of severity before the transition into the severe or critical type.","Qu, Gaojing; Chen, Junwen; Huang, Guoxin; Zhang, Meiling; Yu, Hui; Zhu, Haoming; Chen, Lei; Wang, Dengru; Pei, Bin",Int J Med Sci,,550

Specifically, the study is oriented to explore the relationship between feeling of belonging to an online community and individual and collective regulation of learning. For this aim, a combination of two already tested scales was operated, adapted for the research interests of this study and administered to a sample of MOOC participants. Several structural equation modelling analyses demonstrate that co- and self-regulated learning strategies lead to MOOC achievement (final exam score), and social capital is only a moderator of co-regulated learning (collective evaluation of content and collective decision-making) but not for self-regulated learning (individual environment control).","Chaker, Rawad; Impedovo, Maria Antonietta",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,550
401049,COVID-19 impact on the quality of life of teachers: A cross-sectional study,2020,"To date, there is no final FDA-approved treatment for COVID-19. There are thousands of studies published on the available treatments for COVID-19 virus in the past year. Therefore, it is crucial to synthesize and summarize the evidence from published studies on the safety and efficacy of experimental treatments of COVID-19. We conducted a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, GHL, OpenGrey, ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases through April 2020. We obtained 2699 studies from the initial literature search. Of them, we included 28 eligible studies that met our eligibility criteria. The sample size of the included studies is 2079 individuals. We extracted and pooled the available data and conducted a quality assessment for the eligible studies. From the 28 studies, only 13 studies provide strong evidence. Our results showed that Favipiravir and Hydroxycholoroquine shorten viral clearance and clinical recovery time and promote pneumonia absorption. On the other hand, Lopinavir-ritonavir either alone or combined with arbidol or interferons has no significant difference superior to the standard care. Corticosteroids, Convalescent plasma transfusion, and anticoagulant therapies provide a better prognosis. Remedsivir, Tocilizumab, Immunoglobulin, Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation showed effective treatment results, but further confirmatory studies are needed. In conclusion, Favipiravir and Remedsivir might be promising drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. .","Wadaa-Allah, Ahmed; Emhamed, Marwa S; Sadeq, Mohammed A; Ben Hadj Dahman, Nesrine; Ullah, Irfan; Farrag, Nesrine S; Negida, Ahmed",Ann Med,,550
401062,Characterization and Comparison of the Utilization of Facebook Groups Between Public Medical Professionals and Technical Communities to Facilitate Idea Sharing and Crowdsourcing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Observational Study,2021,"Some feminist scholars have asserted that nominal representation does not secure substantive representation for gender equality and that the mere presence of more women in politics does not necessary lead to inclusive policies. This assertion makes sense because advancing gender equality and equitable opportunities requires a strategy to address intersectional forms of oppression, a systemic requirement that was historically lacking across much of the Arab Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. More recently, on the eve of the twenty-sixth anniversary of the 1995 Beijing Conference, governments across the region are laying claim to substantive advances in gender mainstreaming and to increasing the presence of women in political institutions, particularly in the resource-rich gulf. Despite the rush to support gender-inclusive policies, MENA governments did not bring the level or kind of gender equality and inclusion envisioned. This article explores the ways in which state feminism is advanced by governments across the MENA. We conduct a brief historical overview of women’s machineries and feminist movements and propose a way forward that cuts across countries, sectors, and age groups. We envision a consolidated movement that seeks to ensure that the prevailing form of feminism is one that champions the rights and interests of the collective and not of the few who are in power.","Geha, Carmen Karam Charlotte",The SAIS Review of International Affairs,,550

Given the havoc wreaked by this pathogen worldwide, many countries have adopted an extreme, legally enforced method of social distancing, in the form of a lockdown. Unless appropriate preventive steps are taken, the cost of the pandemic and ensuing lockdown may prove to be irreparable. The evident implications of this lockdown, such as the escalating levels of unemployment, impending economic collapse, and severe food shortage faced by the sudden unemployed migrant labor population, have been widely reported. Cancer patients are a particularly vulnerable group even during nonpandemic times, often presenting late in the course of their disease, without the resources needed to avail recommended treatment. The prevalence of psychiatric complications and emotional distress is significantly higher than in the general population, and the trauma of both the pandemic and subsequent lockdown adds significantly to their mental trauma. This review is aimed toward addressing the problems faced by cancer patients in the face of this pandemic and subsequent lockdown, with a glimpse into possible solutions that can be implemented.","Ballal, Devesh; Gulia, Seema; Gulia, Ashish",Indian J.

401496,Misinformation on COVID-19 origin and its relationship with perception and knowledge about social distancing: A cross-sectional study,2021,"Introduction The art of clinical examination has been the cornerstone of medical practices since ancient years. Recent technological achievements and their overuse have led falsely to underestimation of their significance, which has been further questioned during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to concerns regarding exposure risk and use of personal protective equipment.Areas covered The role of clinical examination (namely chest examination) during the pandemic is discussed. Emerging evidence is being accumulated concerning alternatives to traditional practices. Telemedicine stands out as a promising tool, allowing inspection and interaction between physicians and patients, proved to be useful for many medical specialties but not enough for some others. Medical practices cannot remain the same in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet realistic strategies should be adopted for their optimal and safe implementation.Expert opinion The experiences of a dedicated Reference Center for COVID-19 along with a suggested algorithm for conducting clinical examinations are presented. According to our experience, an initial detailed clinical examination upon admission of each COVID-19 patient appears to be necessary. Then, vital signs and signs of respiratory distress using inspection should be checked frequently. A focused examination approach should be adopted, in case of new onset clinical problems.","Kyriakoulis, Konstantinos G; Poulakou, Garyphallia; Nitsotolis, Thomas; Syrigos, Konstantinos N",Expert Rev Respir Med,,550

404229,Adaptations of a Tertiary Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Department in Singapore during the COVID-19 Outbreak,2020,"This work constructs, analyzes, and simulates a new compartmental SEIR-type model for the dynamics and potential control of the current COVID-19 pandemic. The novelty in this work is two-fold. First, the population is divided according to its compliance with disease control directives (lockdown, shelter-in-place, masks/face coverings, physical distancing, etc.) into those who fully comply and those who follow the directives partially, or are necessarily mobile (such as medical staff). This split, indirectly, reflects on the quality and consistency of these measures. This allows the assessment of the overall effectiveness of the control measures and the impact of their relaxing or tightening on the disease spread. Second, the adequate contact rate, which directly affects the infection rate, is one of the model unknowns, as it keeps track of the changes in the population behavior and the effectiveness of various disease treatment modalities via a differential inclusion. Existence, uniqueness and positivity results are proved using a nonstandard convex analysis-based approach. As a case study, the pandemic outbreak in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) is simulated. The model parameters were found by minimizing the deviation of the model prediction from the reported data over the first 100 days of the pandemic in South Korea.The simulations show that the model captures accurately the pandemic dynamics in the subsequent 75 days, which provides confidence in the model predictions and its future use. In particular, the model predicts that about 40% of the infections were not documented, which implies that asymptomatic infections contribute silently but substantially to the spread of the disease indicating that more widespread asymptomatic testing is necessary.","Cesmelioglu, Aycil; Kuttler, Kenneth L.; Shillor, Meir; Spagnuolo, Anna M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03248v2.pdf,550

For example, an environmental activist might say,""Leading scientists agree that global warming is a serious concern,""framing a clause which affirms their own stance (""that global warming is serious"") as an opinion endorsed (""[scientists] agree"") by a reputable source (""leading""). In contrast, a global warming denier might frame the same clause as the opinion of an untrustworthy source with a predicate connoting doubt:""Mistaken scientists claim [...].""Our work studies opinion-framing in the global warming (GW) debate, an increasingly partisan issue that has received little attention in NLP. We introduce DeSMOG, a dataset of stance-labeled GW sentences, and train a BERT classifier to study novel aspects of argumentation in how different sides of a debate represent their own and each other's opinions. From 56K news articles, we find that similar linguistic devices for self-affirming and opponent-doubting discourse are used across GW-accepting and skeptic media, though GW-skeptical media shows more opponent-doubt. We also find that authors often characterize sources as hypocritical, by ascribing opinions expressing the author's own view to source entities known to publicly endorse the opposing view. We release our stance dataset, model, and lexicons of framing devices for future work on opinion-framing and the automatic detection of GW stance.","Luo, Yiwei; Card, Dallas; Jurafsky, Dan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15149v1.pdf,550

A Cross-Sectional Validation Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: At the COVID-19 pandemic peak in Spain, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of 578 randomly selected health care workers (HCW) from Hospital Clínic de Barcelona was 11.2%. METHODS: A follow-up survey one month later (April-May 2020) measured infection by rRT-PCR and IgM, IgA, IgG to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein by Luminex. Antibody kinetics, including IgG subclasses, was assessed till month 3. RESULTS: At month 1, the prevalence of infection measured by rRT-PCR and serology was 14.9% (84/565) and the seroprevalence 14.5% (82/565). We found 25 (5%) new infections in participants without previous evidence of infection (501). IgM, IgG and IgA levels declined in 3 months (antibody decay rates 0.15 (95% CI, 0.11; 0.19), 0.66 (95% CI, 0.54; 0.82), 0.12 (95% CI, 0.09; 0.16), respectively), and 68.33% of HCW had seroreverted for IgM, 3.08% for IgG, and 24.29% for IgA. The most frequent subclass responses were IgG1 (highest levels) and IgG2, followed by IgG3, and only IgA1 but no IgA2 was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous and improved surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCW remains critical, particularly in high-risk groups. The observed fast decay of IgA and IgM levels have implications for seroprevalence studies using these isotypes.","Moncunill, Gemma; Mayor, Alfredo; Santano, Rebeca; Jiménez, Alfons; Vidal, Marta; Tortajada, Marta; Sanz, Sergi; Méndez, Susana; Llupià, Anna; Aguilar, Ruth; Alonso, Selena; Barrios, Diana; Carolis, Carlo; Cisteró, Pau; Chóliz, Eugenia; Cruz, Angeline; Fochs, Silvia; Jairoce, Chenjerai; Hecht, Jochen; Lamoglia, Montserrat; Martínez, Mikel J; Moreno, Javier; Mitchell, Robert A; Ortega, Natalia; Pey, Nuria; Puyol, Laura; Ribes, Marta; Rosell, Neus; Figueroa-Romero, Antía; Sotomayor, Patricia; Torres, Sara; Williams, Sarah; Barroso, Sonia; Vilella, Anna; Trilla, Antoni; Varela, Pilar; Dobaño, Carlota; Garcia-Basteiro, Alberto L",,,550

Hence, it is essential to investigate how human mobility and travel ban affect the transmission and spatial spread while minimizing the impact on social activities and national economics. METHODS: We developed a mobility network model for spatial epidemics, explicitly taking into account time-varying inter-province and inner-province population flows, spatial heterogeneity in terms of disease transmission, as well as the impact of media reports. The model is applied to study the epidemic of the dynamic network of 30 provinces of mainland China. The model was calibrated using the publicly available incidence and movement data. RESULTS: We estimated that the second outbreak occurred approximately on February 24, 2020, and the cumulative number of cases as of March 15, 2020, increased by 290.1% (95% CI: (255.3%, 324.9%)) without a travel ban in mainland China (excluding Hubei and Tibet). We found that intra-province travel contributes more to the increase of cumulative number of cases than inter-province travel. CONCLUSION: Our quantitative and qualitative research results suggest that the strict travel ban has successfully prevented a severe secondary outbreak in mainland China, which provides solutions for many countries and regions experiencing secondary outbreaks of COVID-19.","Xue, Ling; Jing, Shuanglin; Sun, Wei; Liu, Maoxing; Peng, Zhihang; Zhu, Huaiping",Int J Infect Dis,,550

Dynamic changes in circulating lymphocytes are features of COVID-19. We aimed to investigate if cfDNA level can serve in stratification of COVID-19 patients, and if cfDNA level is associated with alterations in lymphocyte subsets and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). This cross-sectional comparative study enrolled 64 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Patients were subdivided to severe and non-severe groups. Plasma cfDNA concentration was determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Lymphocyte subsets were assessed by flow cytometry. There was significant increase in cfDNA among severe cases when compared with non-severe cases. cfDNA showed positive correlation with NLR and inverse correlation with T cell percentage. cfDNA positively correlated with ferritin and C-reactive protein. The output data of performed ROC curves to differentiate severe from non-severe cases revealed that cfDNA at cut-off &#8805;17.31 ng/µl and AUC of 0.96 yielded (93%) sensitivity and (73%) specificity. In summary, excessive release of cfDNA can serve as sensitive COVID-19 severity predictor. There is an association between cfDNA up-regulation and NLR up-regulation and T cell percentage down-regulation. cfDNA level can be used in stratification and personalized monitoring strategies in COVID-19 patients.","Hammad, Reham; Eldosoky, Mona Abd El Rahman; Fouad, Shaimaa Hani; Elgendy, Abdelaleem; Tawfeik, Amany M; Alboraie, Mohamed; Abdelmaksoud, Mariam Fathy",Innate Immun,,550

To identify the images of prisoners and prisons, in this article, we focus on the discourses of the Peruvian written press about the collective actions (categorized as riots) of prisoners in the context of COVID-19. Through critical discourse analysis, we analyze 81 notes of the seven most-read journals in Peru which inform about the first collective claim actions that occurred in four prisons: Rio Seco, Picsi, Castro Castro and Anexo Chorrillos. The results are organized into three axes: (a) Explanation of the diaries about collective claim action;(b) Men's prisons: Collective claim action defined as riots;and (c) Women's prisons: Collective claim action defined as non-riots. We argue that the notes reproduce the image of prison as a punishment institution, with a tendency to delegitimize collective actions and to portray prisoners as subjects propelled by emotions with no possibility to establish a dialogical encounter. Also, discourses are embedded with stereotypes of crime and gender. Mass media informs through the simplification of the prison system, providing unidimensional images of prisons and prisoners. This makes it difficult to create holistic views that aid to understand the hindering and claims for prisoners' rights in order to establish processes of dialogue to construct alternative resolutions to violence.","Bruce, L.

The consequence of that has been a heightened level of anxiety among humans and opting for unorthodox consumption behaviors as consumers. In this study the attempt was to analyze human behaviors during the ongoing pandemic process from the perspective of psychology and marketing fields of science. In so doing, interrelation among anxiety, which surfaced because of Covid-19 pandemic, coping style with stress of individuals and compulsive purchase behavior has been explored. Based on these interrelations, a structural model was suggested. Findings of the research indicated that anxiety has high effect on the helpless approach dimension, which is one of the coping styles with stress; and that helpless approach alone has an effect on compulsive buying behavior. Besides, another objective of the study was to evaluate the mediating effect of intolerance of uncertainty between coping style with stress and compulsive buying behavior. That analysis evidenced that intolerance of uncertainty in such an interrelation had a partial mediating effect.","Çelik, Samet; Köse, Gözde Güsan",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,550

Recent articles warn of possible long-term consequences on mental health, especially for those who suffer from underlying psychiatric conditions and for vulnerable sections of the population. The present study explores the psychological impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on outpatients at the Centre of Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMHS), which is based in Barcelona. METHODS: A total of 441 caregivers answered an online ad-hoc survey on their sociodemographic and economic situation, perceived stress, and clinical changes and coping strategies observed in their children during lockdown. The Chi-square test was used to compare the response percentages for each behaviour or symptom between age, gender and diagnostic groups. Variance and post-hoc test were also analyzed, as was the Pearson correlation. RESULTS: The use of electronic devices has significantly increased. There has also been an increase in symptoms such as attentional problems, fatigue and irritability, among others. Differences were found between age and gender groups. The diagnostic groups most affected by confinement were Autism Spectrum Disorders and Conduct Disorders. The survey also discovered a relationship between the loss of family income, parental stress and increased symptoms in children.

Recent articles warn of possible long-term consequences on mental health, especially for those who suffer from underlying psychiatric conditions and for vulnerable sections of the population. The present study explores the psychological impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on outpatients at the Centre of Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMHS), which is based in Barcelona. METHODS: A total of 441 caregivers answered an online ad-hoc survey on their sociodemographic and economic situation, perceived stress, and clinical changes and coping strategies observed in their children during lockdown. The Chi-square test was used to compare the response percentages for each behaviour or symptom between age, gender and diagnostic groups. Variance and post-hoc test were also analyzed, as was the Pearson correlation. RESULTS: The use of electronic devices has significantly increased. There has also been an increase in symptoms such as attentional problems, fatigue and irritability, among others. Differences were found between age and gender groups. The diagnostic groups most affected by confinement were Autism Spectrum Disorders and Conduct Disorders. The survey also discovered a relationship between the loss of family income, parental stress and increased symptoms in children. CONCLUSION: Confinement has increased externalizing symptoms and behaviours as well as COVID-19 related concerns, somatic problems and anxieties. It is important to observe the fluctuation of symptoms and how young people adapt to the pandemic in order to reach a better understanding of the situation and devise new strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the pandemic.","Lopez-Serrano, Jara; Díaz-Bóveda, Rosalía; González-Vallespí, Laura; Santamarina-Pérez, Pilar; Bretones-Rodríguez, Antonia; Calvo, Rosa; Lera-Miguel, Sara",,,550

The light-dark cycle is an important regulator of the internal biological clock. Even though pregnant women spend a greater part of the day at home during the latter stages of pregnancy, natural light exposure is crucial for the fetus. The current recommended COVID-19 lockdown might dramatically alter normal environmental lighting conditions of pregnant women, resulting in exposure to extremely low levels of natural daylight and high-intensity artificial light sources during both day and night. This article summarizes the potential effects on pregnant woman and their fetuses due to prolonged exposure to altered photoperiod and as consequence altered circadian system, known as chronodisruption, that may result from the COVID-19 lockdown.","Bagci, S; Sabir, H; Müller, A; Reiter, R J",Chronobiol Int,,550

Higher education institutions have a crucial role in the solution of public health problems by training young doctor candidates, and it is also essential to increase the knowledge level of physician candidates about the epidemic. So, in this study, we aimed to examine Turkish final year medical students' knowledge level and perceptions toward the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The present descriptive multicentered study was conducted with the medical students in the final year of six medical schools located in six geographic regions of Turkey. After ethical approval, data were gathered using an online questionnaire through Google forms between 10 April 2020, and 20 April 2020. RESULTS: In this national survey study, 860 volunteers answered the questions thoroughly. The median age was 24 (22-38) years. A total of 55.3% of the participants were female. The median knowledge level score was 69.0 (0-93.1). The knowledge level was moderate. A total of 34.2% of the participants had a high level of knowledge. A total of 48.7% of participants stated that they felt the most competent about performing CPR. Updates about COVID-19 were followed regularly by 84.5% of the participants. CONCLUSION: We determined that final year medical students are knowledgeable and aware of this pandemic. We, medical educators, should inculcate relevant knowledge and educate the medical students to improve practices in the current pandemic, as well as for future epidemics. Different learning techniques should be added to the curriculum, especially at the time which widespread panic and uncertainty are prevalent.","Çaliskan, Fatih; Midik, Özlem; Baykan, Zeynep; Senol, Yesim; Tanriverdi, Esra Çinar; Tengiz, Funda Ifakat; Gayef, Albena",Postgrad Med,,550
421221,The immediate mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic among people with or without quarantine managements,2020,"AIMS: To assess nurses' burnout and its association with their perceived quality of patient care and occurrence of adverse events (AEs) during COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Burnout is a serious problem among nursing staff internationally with negative impacts on the quality of care and patient safety. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online study among 1,004 Iranian nurses through the convenience sampling technique. Data were collected using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, five items of questions related to self-reported poor patient care quality and estimated occurrence of AEs. RESULTS: Prevalence of high burnout among nurses was 31.5%. The risk of AEs ranged from 26.1% to 71.7%. Self-reported quality of patient care was found to be poor. A positive correlation was found between emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores and patient care quality, whereas a negative correlation was found between personal accomplishment scores and all poor care item scores. Depersonalization was found to increase the risk of the onset of all AEs (odds ratio [OR] = 1.06-1.08). Also, Personal accomplishmentreduced the risk of occurrence of 'medication errors' (OR = 0.99) and the onset of 'patient and their family verbal abuse' (OR = 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirmed the hypothesis that a higher degree of burnout is correlated with a perceived higher number of AEs and reduced perceived patient care quality. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Reducing burnout among nurses through implementing interventions may be an effective strategy to enhance patient care quality and reduce the number of AEs in Iranian public hospitals. Therefore, in order to minimize work burnout, primary approaches include access to psychosocial support, including Web-based services, psychological first aid, mental support hotlines and self-care techniques during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kakemam, Edris; Chegini, Zahra; Rouhi, Amin; Ahmadi, Forouzan; Majidi, Soheila",J. nurs. manag,,550

Unexpectedly, the daily average ozone concentration profile was practically indistinguishable from that of the past two years for the same time span in the calendar. So, we compared surface meteorology data, CO, NOx and O3 hourly concentrations in the MCMA from the ozone season (from March 1 to May 31) for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Also, TROPOMI satellite data on column count of CO, NO2 and HCHO, above a sparse grid of surface points in the MCMA, were also compared for March, April, and May 2020 with those from 2019. Population density used as a background variable to increase understanding of the observed differences allowed us to propose that reductions in NOx were so drastic that ozone formation moved rapidly from a VOC sensitive region towards a NOx sensitive region. The relevance of that unplanned policy provides impacts of contingent short-term emissions control actions during very high pollution episodes. Further analysis of these and other related data concerning VOC speciation and emissions patterns during the coronavirus lockdown may provide guidelines to enhance emission control policies in the post-COVID-19 times to come.","Peralta, Oscar; Ortínez-Alvarez, Abraham; Torres-Jardón, Ricardo; Suárez-Lastra, Manuel; Castro, Telma; Ruíz-Suárez, Luis Gerardo",Sci Total Environ,,550

The most significant public health emergency may be the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying the transmission of infectious disease plays an important role in healthcare for protecting and implementing effective measures for public health. However, studies on SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics are lacking. Infection with the airborne virus is very important and airborne transmission is likely to cause major problems. However, research on the aerosol route of the virus is very limited. Here, we aimed to present airborne coronavirus detection methods in previous studies and address the importance of methodology for the future. In previous studies on airborne coronavirus, detection methods were different in each study. Therefore, comparison between the airborne virus detected in each study is impossible, and the risk assessment could not be properly analysed due to limitations in applying it as basic data. There is currently a risk assessment for coronavirus, but the risk assessment due to airborne transmission is insufficient. Therefore, recommending accurate guidelines for airborne transmission is difficult. Future research should be conducted to standardize airborne virus detection methods to prevent transmission through rapid risk assessment and monitoring.","Yun, H.; Yang, J.; Seo, J. H.; Sohn, J.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a longitudinal study using municipality-level mortality data. METHODS: We investigated the patterns and spatial correlation of EM of men aged &#8805;75 years during the first two pandemic waves (March-April 2020 vs November 2020) of COVID-19, using the mortality data released by the Italian National Institute of Statistics. EM was estimated at the municipality level to accurately detect the critical areas within the region. RESULTS: The areas that were mostly hit during the first wave of COVID-19 were generally spared by the second wave: EM of men aged &#8805;75 years in the municipality of Bergamo plummeted from +472% in March and April to -13% in November, and in Cremona the variation was from +344% to -19%. Conversely, in November 2020 EM was higher in some areas that had been protected in the first wave of the pandemic. Spatial correlation widely corroborates these findings, as large sections of the hot spots of EM detected in the first wave of the pandemic changed into cold spots in the second wave, and vice versa. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal the specular distribution of EM between the first and second wave of the pandemic, which may entail the consequences of social distancing measures and individual behaviors, local management strategies, 'harvesting' of the frailer population and, possibly, acquired immune protection. In conclusion, our findings support the need for continuous monitoring and analysis of mortality data using detailed spatial resolution.","Golinelli, D; Lenzi, J; Adja, K Y C; Reno, C; Sanmarchi, F; Fantini, M P; Gibertoni, D",Public Health,,550

Studies have shown that COVID-19 patients are predisposed to develop secondary infections. This study was conducted to ascertain the prevalence and profiles of co- & secondary infections in patients at the COVID-19 facility in North India. METHODS: We studied the profile of pathogens isolated from 290 clinical samples. Bacterial and fungal pathogens were identified, and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the Vitek2® system. Additionally, respiratory samples were tested for any viral/atypical bacterial co-infections and the presence of AMR genes by FilmArray test. The clinical and outcome data of these patients were also recorded for demographic and outcome measures analyses. RESULTS: A total of 151 (13%) patients had secondary infections, and most got infected within the first 14 days of hospital admission. Patients aged >50 years developed severe symptoms (pâ¯=â¯0.0004) and/or had a fatal outcome (pâ¯=â¯0.0005). In-hospital mortality was 33%.K.pneumoniae (33.3%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by A. baumannii (27.1%).

CONCLUSION: A high rate of secondary infections with resistant pathogens in COVID-19 patients highlights the importance of antimicrobial stewardship programs focussing on supporting the optimal selection of empiric treatment and rapid-de-escalation, based on culture reports.","Khurana, Surbhi; Singh, Parul; Sharad, Neha; Kiro, Vandana V; Rastogi, Neha; Lathwal, Amit; Malhotra, Rajesh; Trikha, Anjan; Mathur, Purva",Indian J Med Microbiol,,550
431035,The Psychological Well-Being of Medical Versus Dental GME Residents During the COVID 19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study,2021,"Medical education is moving towards competency-based medical education (CBME) where learning and assessment are focused on predefined abilities and outcomes. While medical student and residency training have defined competencies and objectives that trainees need to achieve, training remains time -based. Students and residents graduate based on a preset length of training. The COVID -19 pandemic is disrupting educational and clinical environments and in some regions the workforce may not be adequate to respond to the needs of the community. This, therefore, presents an opportunity for the medical education community to reconsider time-based training and embrace a competency-based progression to accelerate entry into the workforce. This commentary discusses undergraduate and graduate medical education response to workforce pressures of COVID-19. On one hand, some medical schools are moving towards competency-based (early) graduation from medical school. On the other hand, residency programs have generally held to time -based completion of training. In the context of this clinical and educational disruption, there are two challenges to CBME progression of trainees. The first challenge is whether there is trust in competency-based assessment to permit time independent progression. The second involves a number of logistical issues to competency-based progression.","Santen, Sally A; Ryan, Michael S; Coates, Wendy C",AEM Edu. Train.,,550

431426,Increase in prevalence of current mental disorders in the context of COVID-19: analysis of repeated nationwide cross-sectional surveys,2020,"As we witness a global change occurring with the advent of e-scooters (electric scooters), it is clear that adequate measures need to be taken for the implementation of this means of transport. Bearing in mind that the user should be the focus of the proposed measures, the aim of this paper encompasses the analysis of e-scooter users’ travel patterns, as well as standard scooter users’ willingness to switch to e-scooters for different hypothetical scenarios, and the determination of factors that have an influence on the users’ willingness to switch. The scenarios include the availability of various infrastructure capacities for the city of Belgrade, namely, a separate infrastructure for e-scooters, or sharing the existing infrastructure with cyclists, pedestrians and motor vehicles. Standard methods of descriptive statistics, the McNemar–Bowker test of paired samples, and multinomial logistic regression were used in this paper. The results showed that there was a statistically significant difference in users’ willingness to use an e-scooter, depending on the available infrastructure. The results of multinomial logistic regression showed that the mode of transport used before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the average distance traveled, had a statistically significant impact on the users’ willingness to switch to e-scooters if they were allowed to use the cycling infrastructure. This paper also identifies additional factors that have a positive (environmental benefits, congestion avoidance) and negative (safety issues, lack of infrastructure, etc.) impact on users’ willingness to switch, which can be of use to decision-makers as a basic guideline for the adequate implementation of e-scooters in transport systems. © 2021 by the authors.

434398,Clinical placements in General Practice: concepts and considerations of implementing remote virtual placements in the COVID world,2021,"Preprints promote the open and fast communication of non-peer reviewed work. Once a preprint is published in a peer-reviewed venue, the preprint server updates its web page: a prominent hyperlink leading to the newly published work is added. Linking preprints to publications is of utmost importance as it provides readers with the latest version of a now certified work. Yet leading preprint servers fail to identify all existing preprint-publication links. This limitation calls for a more thorough approach to this critical information retrieval task: overlooking published evidence translates into partial and even inaccurate systematic reviews on health-related issues, for instance. We designed an algorithm leveraging the Crossref public and free source of bibliographic metadata to comb the literature for preprint-publication links. We tested it on a reference preprint set identified and curated for a living systematic review on interventions for preventing and treating COVID-19 performed by international collaboration: the COVID-NMA initiative (covid-nma.com). The reference set comprised 343 preprints, 121 of which appeared as a publication in a peer-reviewed journal. While the preprint servers identified 39.7% of the preprint-publication links, our linker identified 90.9% of the expected links with no clues taken from the preprint servers. The accuracy of the proposed linker is 91.5% on this reference set, with 90.9% sensitivity and 91.9% specificity. This is a 16.26% increase in accuracy compared to that of preprint servers. We release this software as supplementary material to foster its integration into preprint servers' workflows and enhance a daily preprint-publication chase that is useful to all readers, including systematic reviewers. This preprint-publication linker currently provides day-to-day updates to the biomedical experts of the COVID-NMA initiative.","Cabanac, Guillaume; Oikonomidi, Theodora; Boutron, Isabelle",Scientometrics,,550

However, the relationship between comorbidities and the prognosis of elderly patients with COVID-19 was not clear. This study was supposed to describe the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with COVID-19 infection from Sichuan province and the effects of comorbidity. DESIGN: A retrospective study. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: COVID-19 patients from Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu between December 16, 2019 and February 26, 2020 were included in this study. Patients were divided into elderly group (&#8805;60 years old) and non-elderly group (< 60 years old). RESULTS: Elderly patients with COVID-19 indicated relatively higher proportion of comorbidities, and the most common were atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (56.5%), hypertension (43.5%) and chronic pulmonary disease (21.7%). The proportion of severe cases was higher in elderly group than that in non-elderly group (73.9% and 42.2%, respectively, P=0.012). During hospitalization, elderly patients indicated relatively higher proportion of complications, such as shock (21.7%), respiratory failure (21.7%). The proportion of patients with a decreased number of CD8+ lymphocytes (82.6%) and B lymphocytes (77.8%) in elderly patients was significantly higher than that in non-elderly group (48.9% and 44.8%, respectively). All 3 deaths were elderly patients with comorbidities and the cell counts of T lymphocyte subsets, B and NK cells of them were significantly decreased at admission. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with COVID-19 had a high proportion of severe cases and comorbidities, more likely to show low immune function, and indicate higher proportion of complications.","Dai, S-P; Zhao, X; Wu, J-H",J Nutr Health Aging,,550

For instance, to identify COVID-19 positive patients or people's emotions on COVID-19 pandemic from tweets written in 35 different languages faster and accurate, language categorization and processing of tweets is significantly essential. Among many language categorization and processing techniques, character and word n-gram based techniques are very popular and simple but very efficient for categorizing and processing both short and large documents. One of the fundamental problems of language processing is the efficient use of memory space in implementing a technique so that a vast collection of documents can be easily categorized and processed. In this paper, we introduce a framework that categorizes the language of tweets using n-gram based language categorization technique and further processes the tweets using the machine-learning approach, Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM), that may be able to identify COVID-19 positive patients. We evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed framework in terms of language categorization accuracy, precession, recall, and F-measure over n-gram length. The proposed framework is scalable as many other applications that involve extracting features and classifying languages collected from social media, and different types of networks may use this framework. This proposed framework, also being a part of health monitoring and improvement, tends to achieve the goal of having a sustainable society.","Nasser, Nidal; Karim, Lutful; El Ouadrhiri, Ahmed; Ali, Asmaa; Khan, Nargis",Sustain Cities Soc,,550

We used an accurate rapid diagnostic test kit detecting immunoglobulins (Ig) in 504 adults. Of the 499 participants who obtained a valid antibody test, 54 (10.8%) had a SARS-CoV-2 positive test (0.4% IgM+, 1.8% both IgM+ and IgG+, and 8.6% IgG+). A statistically significant association with infection was found for geographic area (compared to Milan, adjusted odds ratio was 2.79, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.01-7.68 for eastern and 2.82, 95% CI: 1.34-5.94, for southern Lombardy). The clinical staff did not result positive to SARS-CoV-2 more frequently than the administrative staff. This is the first study using antibody test in the dental staff personnel. It shows that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Lombardy region was around 10%, in line with estimates on other healthcare professionals. Despite the close physical contact with the patient, dentists have been able to scrupulously manage and effectively use protective devices.","Gallus, S.; Paroni, L.; Re, D.; Aiuto, R.; Battaglia, D.

The aim of this convergent mixed-methods study is to (a) examine the structure and rates of participation in the spring 2020 meal programs in Connecticut, and (b) obtain insight about the challenges, strategies used, and lessons learned during this time by food service leaders. We obtained quantitative data from the Connecticut State Department of Education and district websites, and qualitative data from nine one-hour interviews with school food service leaders. Although the National School Lunch Program provides meals at standard price, reduced-price, or no cost based on student household income, all emergency meals during spring 2020 were provided at no cost following the school closures resulting from the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration. The average number of meals distributed from March to May 2020 was significantly lower than the overall participation rates (i.e., paid, free, and reduced-price meals combined) prior to COVID-19. However, participation rates in April and May 2020 approached those of free and reduced-price meal participation a year earlier. Four key action themes emerged from the interviews: (1) tailor the program to community needs and resources;(2) identify strategies to facilitate participation;(3) develop partnerships to coordinate school, municipal, and community efforts;and (4) establish programs that encourage resiliency. The interviewees also saw this event as an opportunity to improve the perception of school meals. Innovations developed during the spring 2020 school building closures provide a road map for best practices for the 2020-2021 school year and beyond.","Connolly, K.; Babbin, M. I.; McKee, S.

441984,"Association of Social Network Use With Increased Anxiety Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Anesthesiology, Intensive Care, and Emergency Medicine Teams: Cross-Sectional Web-Based Survey Study",2020,"BACKGROUND: The implementation of lockdowns in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a system switch to remote primary care consulting at the same time as the incidence of domestic violence and abuse (DVA) increased. Lockdown-specific barriers to disclosure of DVA reduced the opportunity for DVA detection and referral. The PRECODE (PRimary care rEsponse to domestic violence and abuse in the COvid-19 panDEmic) study will comprise quantitative analysis of the impact of the pandemic on referrals from IRIS (Identification and Referral to Improve Safety) trained general practices to DVA agencies in the UK and qualitative analysis of the experiences of clinicians responding to patients affected by DVA and adaptations they have made transitioning to remote DVA training and patient support. METHODS/DESIGN: Using a rapid mixed method design, PRECODE will explore and explain the dynamics of DVA referrals and support before and during the pandemic on a national scale using qualitative data and over four years of referrals time series data. We will undertake interrupted-time series and non-linear regression analysis, including sensitivity analyses, on time series of referrals to DVA services from routinely collected data to evaluate the impact of the pandemic and associated lockdowns on referrals to the IRIS Programme, and analyse key determinants associated with changes in referrals. We will also conduct an interview- and observation-based qualitative study to understand the variation, relevance and feasibility of primary care responses to DVA before and during the pandemic and its aftermath. The triangulation of quantitative and qualitative findings using rapid analysis and synthesis will enable the articulation of multiscale trends in primary care responses to DVA and complex mechanisms by which these responses have changed during the pandemic. DISCUSSION: Our findings will inform the implementation of remote primary care and DVA service responses as services re-configure. Understanding the adaptation of clinical and service responses to DVA during the pandemic is crucial for the development of evidence-based, effective remote support and referral beyond the pandemic. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PRECODE is an observational epidemiologic study, not an intervention evaluation or trial. We will not be reporting results of an intervention on human participants.","Szilassy, Eszter; Barbosa, Estela Capelas; Dixon, Sharon; Feder, Gene; Griffiths, Chris; Johnson, Medina; De Simoni, Anna; Wileman, Vari; Panovska-Griffiths, Jasmina; Dowrick, Anna",BMC Fam Pract,,550

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study describes the multidisciplinary COVID-19 Activity Rehabilitation Program, established at Mayo Clinic to evaluate and treat patients with post-COVID syndrome, and reports the clinical characteristics of the first 100 patients receiving evaluation and management during the timeframe of June 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 100 patients (mean age, 45.4±14.2 years; 68% women; mean body mass index, 30.2 kg/m2; presenting a mean of 93 days after infection). Common preexisting conditions were respiratory (23%) and mental health, including depression and/or anxiety (34%). Most (75%) had not been hospitalized for COVID-19. Common presenting symptoms ware fatigue (80%), respiratory complaints (59%), and neurological complaints (59%) followed by subjective cognitive impairment, sleep disturbance, and mental health symptoms. More than one-third of patients (34%) reported difficulties in performing basic activities of daily living. Only 1 in 3 patients had returned to unrestricted work duty at the time of the analysis. For most patients, laboratory and imaging tests showed no abnormalities or were nondiagnostic despite debilitating symptoms. Most patients required physical therapy, occupational therapy, or brain rehabilitation. Face-to-face and virtual care delivery modalities were feasible. CONCLUSION: Most of the patients did not have COVID-19-related symptoms that were severe enough to require hospitalization, were younger than 65 years, and were more likely to be female, and most had no preexisting comorbidities before severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Symptoms including mood disorders, fatigue, and perceived cognitive impairment resulted in severe negative impacts on resumption of functional and occupational activities in patients experiencing prolonged effects.","Vanichkachorn, Greg; Newcomb, Richard; Cowl, Clayton T; Murad, M Hassan; Breeher, Laura; Miller, Sara; Trenary, Michael; Neveau, Daniel; Higgins, Steven",Mayo Clin Proc,,550

447167,Covid-19 pandemic and management of patients with chronic neurological conditions in low-middle income countries: The added burden,2020,"BACKGROUND: The comparative performance of different clinical sampling methods for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR among populations with suspected infection remains unclear. This meta-analysis aims to systematically compare the diagnostic performance of different clinical specimen collection methods. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN, and Research Square from Jan 1, 2000, to Nov 16, 2020. We included original clinical studies that examined the performance of nasopharyngeal swabs and any additional respiratory specimens for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals presenting in ambulatory care. Studies without data on paired samples, or those that only examined different samples from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases were not useful for examining diagnostic performance of a test and were excluded. Diagnostic performance, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, was examined using random effects models and double arcsine transformation. FINDINGS: Of the 5577 studies identified in our search, 23 studies including 7973 participants with 16 762 respiratory samples were included. Respiratory specimens examined in these studies included 7973 nasopharyngeal swabs, 1622 nasal swabs, 6110 saliva samples, 338 throat swabs, and 719 pooled nasal and throat swabs. Using nasopharyngeal swabs as the gold standard, pooled nasal and throat swabs gave the highest sensitivity of 97% (95% CI 93-100), whereas lower sensitivities were achieved by saliva (85%, 75-93) and nasal swabs (86%, 77-93) and a much lower sensitivity by throat swabs (68%, 35-94). A comparably high positive predictive value was obtained by pooled nasal and throat (97%, 90-100) and nasal swabs (96%, 87-100) and a slightly lower positive predictive value by saliva (93%, 88-97). Throat swabs have the lowest positive predictive value of 75% (95% CI 45-96). Comparably high specificities (range 97-99%) and negative predictive value (range 95-99%) were observed among different clinical specimens. Comparison between health-care-worker collection and self-collection for pooled nasal and throat swabs and nasal swabs showed comparable diagnostic performance. No significant heterogeneity was observed in the analysis of pooled nasal and throat swabs and throat swabs, whereas moderate to substantial heterogeneity (I2 &#8805;30%) was observed in studies on saliva and nasal swabs. INTERPRETATION: Our review suggests that, compared with the gold standard of nasopharyngeal swabs, pooled nasal and throat swabs offered the best diagnostic performance of the alternative sampling approaches for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ambulatory care. Saliva and nasal swabs gave comparable and very good diagnostic performance and are clinically acceptable alternative specimen collection methods. Throat swabs gave a much lower sensitivity and positive predictive value and should not be recommended. Self-collection for pooled nasal and throat swabs and nasal swabs was not associated with any significant impairment of diagnostic accuracy. Our results also provide a useful reference framework for the proper interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 testing results using different clinical specimens.

The current study aimed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of resveratrol when administered alone and in combination with nicotinamide against alcohol-aflatoxin B1-induced HCC. Results reveal that during the development and progression of cancer, there was a decline in the level of antioxidant enzymes catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase (GR), antioxidant glutathione, and glutathione S-transferase, which is an enzyme of detoxification pathways. Treatment of resveratrol restored the level of catalase and glutathione peroxidase toward normal in alcohol-aflatoxin B1-induced HCC; however, nicotinamide worked in concert with resveratrol only in upregulating the activity of glutathione reductase, glutathione level, and glutathione S-transferase. SIRT1 agonist resveratrol was observed to modulate the activity of antioxidant enzymes by negatively regulating the expression of nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) in alcohol-aflatoxin B1-induced HCC, thereby suggesting a cross-talk between antioxidant enzymes SIRT1 and NF-&#954;B during the development and progression of HCC and its therapeutics by resveratrol and nicotinamide.","Rawat, Divya; Chhonker, Saurabh Kumar; Naik, Rayees Ahmad; Koiri, Raj Kumar",J Biochem Mol Toxicol,,550

Here, we studied the use of inorganic talc microparticles (hydrous magnesium silicate, 3MgO·4SiO2·H2O, 10 µm) as a general supplement to enhance natural product formation in this important class of bacteria. Added to cultures of recombinant Streptomyces lividans, talc enhanced production of the macrocyclic peptide antibiotic bottromycin A2 and its methylated derivative Met-bottromycin A2 up to 109 mg L-1 , the highest titer reported so far. Hereby, the microparticles fundamentally affected metabolism. With 10 g L-1 talc, S. lividans grew to 40% smaller pellets and, using RNA sequencing, revealed accelerated morphogenesis and aging, indicated by early upregulation of developmental regulator genes such as ssgA, ssgB, wblA, sigN and bldN. Furthermore, the microparticles re-balanced the expression of individual bottromycin cluster genes, resulting in a higher macrocyclization efficiency at the level of BotAH and correspondingly lower levels of non-cyclized shunt by-products, driving the production of mature bottromycin. Testing a variety of Streptomyces species, talc addition resulted in up to 13-fold higher titers for the RiPPs bottromycin and cinnamycin, the alkaloid undecylprodigiosin, the polyketide pamamycin, the tetracycline-type oxytetracycline, and the anthramycin-analogues usabamycins. Moreover, talc addition boosted production in other actinobacteria, outside of the genus of Streptomyces: vancomycin (Amycolatopsis japonicum DSM 44213), teicoplanin (Actinoplanes teichomyceticus ATCC 31121), and the angucyclinone-type antibiotic simocyclinone (Kitasatospora sp.). For teicoplanin, the microparticles were even crucial to activate production. Taken together, the use of talc was beneficial in 75% of all tested cases and optimized natural and heterologous hosts forming the substance of interest with clusters under native and synthetic control. Given its simplicity and broad benefits, microparticle-supplementation appears as an enabling technology in natural product research of these most important microbes.

462047,Healing the Healer: Protecting Emergency Health Care Workers' Mental Health During COVID-19,2020,"The current pandemic situation has created many challenges for maintaining positive relationships between fast fashion retailers and their suppliers. In the proposed paper it is assumed that strong and ethical relationships may be beneficial for all supply chain members, especially in the era of global pandemic. Therefore, the aforementioned issues (fast fashion retailers’ ethical behavior towards suppliers) constituted the subject of the paper. Our knowledge about relationships between fast retail chains and their suppliers in the times of global pandemic is relatively week. Trying to fill the gap, this paper discussed relationships between fast fashion retail chains and their suppliers’ customers on the basis of literature review and case study research. Purpose: The aim of the paper was to indicate the scope of activities undertaken by retailers and addressed at suppliers by fast fashion retail chains in pandemic times. The following goals of descriptive and cognitive character were assumed in the paper: (a) Identification of the fast fashion retailers’ common behavior in the era of pandemic, and (b) indication of ethical practices applied by fast fashion retail chains which are beneficial for all retail chain members, based on the Inditex example. Methodology: Based on the theoretic deliberation of retail chain relationships with suppliers in the pandemic times, qualitative research was conducted to supplement the theoretical background. The purpose of this study was to identify how fast fashion retailers maintain relationships with their suppliers in supply chains. The conducted research enabled us to reveal answers to the following research questions: What are good practices of fast fashion retailers in terms of relationships with suppliers? Can socially responsible, trustworthy fast fashion retailers stay profitable in the Covid-19 pandemic? The theoretical deliberation was based on a critical literature review. The empirical part of the paper was based on case study research. The conducted research was descriptive in nature, conducted in order to describe a particular phenomenon within its context, and was not intended to provide conclusive evidence, but to have a better understanding of the problem. A descriptive intrinsic case study was the method applied in the research. Results: On the grounds of literature studies, as well as collected information, we can state that close and ethical cooperation with suppliers, based on socially responsible relationships, are becoming a more and more important part of the strategy for commercial chains. There are companies that use any legal measures to not fulfil their obligations as contractors and avoid paying for orders completed and in production. The descriptive case study research allowed us to observe, analyze, and report good practices of fast fashion retailers in terms of relationships with their suppliers based on the Inditex example. The theoretical contribution: On the grounds of the case study, we can state that during pandemic times fast fashion retail chains have focused on the development of relationships with suppliers, which means changing from transactional to relationship marketing in cooperation strategies. Practical implications (if applicable): The paper provided intellectual input into the managerial problem of how to develop mutual beneficiary relationships between fast retail chains and their suppliers. The study suggests that fast fashion retail chains have to take into consideration growing customer expectations, which regard their cooperation’s strategies toward suppliers.","Dewalska-Opitek, Anna Bilińska-Reformat Katarzyna",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,,550

Hence, this study is aimed at assessing the level of preparedness for COVID-19 and its associated factors among frontline healthcare providers in South Gondar public hospitals, northwest Ethiopia. Methods and Materials: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 207 selected healthcare providers who were working in South Gondar public hospital from July 08 to August 29, 2020. A pretested structured questionnaire was used to collect data. The healthcare providers were selected through simple random sampling techniques. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions with a 95% confidence interval were fitted with 95% CI to establish the associated factors with a low level of preparedness. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The overall level of preparedness among healthcare providers for COVID-19 was found to be 41.3% (95% CI: 37.4, 44.7). Only 81 (40.1%) healthcare providers had prepared for telling their family and friends if they are infected with COVID-19. Besides, only 23.8% of healthcare providers obtained alcohol-based hand sanitizer in every patient room. Factors associated with a low level of preparedness include being male (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.22-4.94), unmarried (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.44-8.00), and working experience less than five years (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.29-9.09). Conclusion: The level of preparedness among frontline healthcare providers towards COVID-19 was found to be very low. In the future, more emphasis should be placed on healthcare providers who are male, unmarried, and had working experience of lower than five years to decrease the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chanie, Ermias Sisay; Feleke, Dejen Getaneh; Fetene, Sheganew; Tigabu, Agimasie; Asnakew, Sintayehu; Tiruneh, Tegenaw; Mekie, Maru; Ayehu, Gashaw Walle; Bayih, Wubet Alebachew",Biomed Res Int,,550

The limited exchange of information outside of the quarterly clinic visits impedes optimal disease self-management, patient engagement, and shared decision making. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to adapt a mobile health (mHealth) app originally developed in Sweden to the needs of patients, families, and health care providers in a CF center in the United States and to test it as a platform for sharing patient-generated health data with the CF health care team. METHODS: Focus groups with health care providers of patients with CF, adolescents with CF, and caregivers of children with CF were conducted to determine what modifications were necessary. Focus group data were analyzed using a thematic analysis, and emergent themes were ranked according to desirability and technical feasibility. The mHealth platform was then modified to meet the identified needs and preferences, and the flow of patient-generated health data to a secure Research Electronic Data Capture database was tested. Protocols for data management and clinical follow-up were also developed. RESULTS: A total of 5 focus groups with 21 participants were conducted. Recommended modifications pertained to all functionalities of the mHealth platform, including tracking of symptoms, treatments, and activities of daily care; creating and organizing medication lists and setting up reminders; generating reports for the health care team; language and presentation; sharing and privacy; and settings and accounts. Overall, health care providers recommended changes to align the mHealth platform with US standards of care, people with CF and their caregivers requested more tracking functionalities, and both groups suggested the inclusion of a mental health tracker as well as more detailed response options and precise language. Beta testers of the modified platform reported issues related to translatability to US environment and various bugs. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the importance of identifying the needs and preferences of target users and stakeholders before adopting existing mHealth solutions. All relevant perspectives, including those of clinicians, patients, and caregivers, should be thoroughly considered to meet both end users' needs and evidence-based practice recommendations.","Rutland, Sarah B; Bergquist, Rikard Palmer; Hager, Andreas; Geurs, Robin; Mims, Cathy; Gutierrez, Hector H; Oates, Gabriela R",JMIR Form Res,,550

471601,"Triggers of mental health problems among frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in private care homes and domiciliary care agencies: Lived experiences of care workers in the Midlands region, UK",2020,"INTRODUCTION: On-boat resuscitation can be applied by lifeguards in an inflatable rescue boat (IRB). Due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) and recommendations for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), prehospital care procedures need to be re-evaluated. The objective of this study was to determine how the use of PPE influences the amount of preparation time needed before beginning actual resuscitation and the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR; QCPR) on an IRB. METHODS: Three CPR tests were performed by 14 lifeguards, in teams of two, wearing different PPE: (1) Basic PPE (B-PPE): gloves, a mask, and protective glasses; (2) Full PPE (F-PPE): B-PPE + a waterproof apron; and (3) Basic PPE + plastic blanket (B+PPE). On-boat resuscitation using a bag-valve-mask (BVM) and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was performed sailing at 20km/hour. RESULTS: Using B-PPE takes less time and is significantly faster than F-PPE (B-PPE 17 [SD = 2] seconds versus F-PPE 69 [SD = 17] seconds; P = .001), and the use of B+PPE is slightly higher (B-PPE 17 [SD = 2] seconds versus B+PPE 34 [SD = 6] seconds; P = .002). The QCPR remained similar in all three scenarios (P >.05), reaching values over 79%. CONCLUSION: The use of PPE during on-board resuscitation is feasible and does not interfere with quality when performed by trained lifeguards. The use of a plastic blanket could be a quick and easy alternative to offer extra protection to lifeguards during CPR on an IRB.","Barcala-Furelos, Roberto; Abelairas-Gómez, Cristian; Alonso-Calvete, Alejandra; Cano-Noguera, Francisco; Carballo-Fazanes, Aida; Martínez-Isasi, Santiago; Rodríguez-Núñez, Antonio",Prehosp Disaster Med,,550

METHODS: An optical mark recognition/optical character recognition (OMR/OCR) system was developed to identify fields that were selected on 2,814 paper assessment forms, each with 141 fields which were used to assess potential COVID-19 infections. A novel user interface (UI) displayed mirrored forms showing the scanned assessment forms with OMR results superimposed on the left and an editable web form on the right to improve ease of data validation. Crowdsourced participants validated the results of the OMR system. Overall error rate and time taken to validate were calculated. A subset of forms was validated by multiple participants to calculate agreement between participants. RESULTS: The OMR/OCR tools correctly extracted data from scanned forms fields with an average accuracy of 70% and median accuracy of 78% when the OMR/OCR results were compared with the results from crowd validation. Scanned forms were crowd-validated at a mean rate of 157 seconds per document and a volume of approximately 108 documents per day. A randomly selected subset of documents was reviewed by multiple participants, producing an interobserver agreement of 97% for documents when narrative-text fields were included and 98% when only Boolean and multiple-choice fields were considered. CONCLUSION: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be challenging for health care workers wearing personal protective equipment to interact with electronic health records. The combination of OMR/OCR technology, a novel UI, and crowdsourcing data-validation processes allowed for the efficient extraction of a large volume of paper medical documents produced during the COVID-19 pandemic.","White-Dzuro, Colin G; Schultz, Jacob D; Ye, Cheng; Coco, Joseph R; Myers, Janet M; Shackelford, Claude; Rosenbloom, S Trent; Fabbri, Daniel",Appl Clin Inform,,550

These techniques, often represented by scatter plots, are employed in diverse science domains and facilitate similarity analysis among clusters and data samples. For datasets containing many granularities or when analysis follows the information visualization mantra, hierarchical DR techniques are the most suitable approach since they present major structures beforehand and details on demand. However, current hierarchical DR techniques are not fully capable of addressing literature problems because they do not preserve the projection mental map across hierarchical levels or are not suitable for most data types. This work presents HUMAP, a novel hierarchical dimensionality reduction technique designed to be flexible on preserving local and global structures and preserve the mental map throughout hierarchical exploration. We provide empirical evidence of our technique's superiority compared with current hierarchical approaches and show two case studies to demonstrate its strengths.","Marc'ilio-Jr, Wilson E.; Eler, Danilo M.; Paulovich, Fernando V.; Martins, Rafael M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07718v1.pdf,550

The protocol used Charité's nucleocapsid (Sarbeco-N) and NIID's nucleocapsid (NIID-N2) assays. During the following months, SARS-CoV-2 spread causing a global pandemic, and a variety of SARS-CoV-2 sequences were registered to public databases, such as the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). In this study, we evaluated the newly developed S2 assay (NIID-S2) to replace the Sarbeco-N assay and the performance of NIID-N2 and NIID-S2 assays, referring mismatches in the primer/probe targeted region. We found the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the NIID-S2 set were comparable to the NIID-N2 assay, and the detection rate for clinical specimens was identical to that of the NIID-N2 assay. Furthermore, among available sequences (approximately 192,000), the NIID-N2 and NIID-S2 sets had 2.6% and 1.2% mismatched sequences, respectively, although most of these mismatches did not affect the amplification efficiency, with the exception of the 3' end of the NIID-N2 forward primer. These findings indicate that the previously developed NIID-N2 assay remains suitable for the detection SARS-CoV-2 with support of the newly developed NIID-S2 set.","Shirato, Kazuya; Tomita, Yuriko; Katoh, Hiroshi; Yamada, Souichi; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Takeda, Makoto",Jpn. j. infect. dis,,550

Currently, there are no specific therapeutic agents for coronavirus infections. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is a potentially effective treatment option. METHODS: Patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and had been discharged from the hospital for more than 2 weeks were recruited. COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP)-specific donor screening and selection were performed based on the following criteria: 1) aged 18-55 years; 2) eligible for blood donation; 3) diagnosed with COVID-19; 4) had two consecutive negative COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab tests based on PCR (at least 24 hr apart) prior to hospital discharge; 5) had been discharged from the hospital for more than 2 weeks; and 6) had no COVID-19 symptoms prior to convalescent plasma donation. In addition, preference was given to CCP donors who had a fever lasting more than 3 days or a body temperature exceeding 38.5°C (101.3°F), and who donated 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms. CCP collection was performed using routine plasma collection procedures via plasmapheresis. In addition to routine donor testing, the CCP donors' plasma was also tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and S-RBD-specific IgG antibody. RESULTS: Of the 81 potential CCP donors, 64 (79%) plasma products were collected. There were 18 female donors and 46 male donors. There were 34 first-time blood donors and 30 repeat donors. The average time between CCP collection and initial symptom onset was 49.1 days, and the average time between CCP collection and hospital discharge was 38.7 days. The average volume of CCP collected was 327.7 mL. All Alanine transaminase (ALT) testing results met blood donation requirements. HIV Ag/Ab, anti-HCV, anti-syphilis, and HBsAg were all negative; NAT for HIV, HBV, and HCV were also negative. In addition, all of the CCP donors' plasma units were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Of the total 64 CCP donors tested, only one had an S-RBD-specific IgG titer of 1:160, all others had a titer of &#8805;1:320. CONCLUSION: Based on a feasibility study of a pilot CCP program in Wuhan, China, we demonstrated the success and feasibility of CCP collection. In addition, all of the CCP units collected had a titer of &#8805;1:160 for S-RBD-specific IgG antibody, which met the CCP quality control requirements based on the Chinese national guidelines for CCP.","Li, Ling; Yang, Ru; Wang, Jue; Lv, Qilu; Ren, Ming; Zhao, Lei; Chen, Hanwei; Xu, Haixia; Xie, Songli; Xie, Jin; Lin, Hui; Li, Wenjuan; Fang, Peng; Gong, Li; Wang, Lan; Wu, Yanyun; Liu, Zhong",Transfusion,,550

Here, we will provide an overview of therapeutic options for COVID-19. Plasma from patients recovered from COVID-19 that contains antibodies against SARS-CoV2 has shown promising results in patients with severe COVID-19. Also, IVIG, combined with moderate-dose of corticosteroids, might improve patient outcomes. Evidence links COVID-19 to variable degrees of inflammation. Studies show that the use of corticosteroids might accelerate recovery from COVID-19. There are, however, no controlled clinical trials that show whether the use of corticosteroids can reduce COVID-19-related death. Also, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 is the best-documented cytokine in COVID-19 correlated with severity, criticality, viral load, and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL6, could confer clinical benefit in patients with high IL6 levels.

Two groups of different psychiatric disorders were compared: depression or anxiety disorders (D+A) versus bipolar disorder and schizophrenia related disorders (BD+SCZ). RESULTS: 413 CC and 206 MI were included in the study. CC reported to use more adaptive coping strategies as following a routine, talking to friends/relatives, practicing physical exercise and maintaining a balanced diet. MI reported significantly more anxiety and depression symptoms during the lockdown when compared to CC. Gaining weight, sleep changes, and tobacco consumption were more prevalent in the MI group. The D+A group showed significantly more psychological distress and negative expectations about the future, suffered more sleep disturbances when compared to BD+SCZ, whilst reported to practice more exercise. LIMITATIONS: psychiatric disorders were self-reported. CONCLUSIONS: Imposed restrictions and uncertainty during confinement had a higher psychological impact in individuals with a psychiatric illness, with less healthy behavior strategies to face the situation. Developing interventions to mitigate negative mental health outcomes among this vulnerable population will be essential in the coming months.","B, Solé; N, Verdolini; S, Amoretti; L, Montejo; Ar, Rosa; B, Hogg; C, Garcia-Rizo; G, Mezquida; M, Bernardo; A, Martinez-Aran; E, Vieta; C, Torrent",J Affect Disord,,550

An investigation is taking place to understand the cases and their triggers. The vaccine will be administered to a large number of individuals worldwide and concerns raised for severe adverse events might occur. With the current information, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) states its position for the following preliminary recommendations that are to be revised as soon as more data emerges. To minimize the risk of severe allergic reactions in vaccinated individuals, it is urgently required to understand the specific nature of the reported severe allergic reactions, including the background medical history of the individuals affected and the mechanisms involved. To achieve this goal all clinical and laboratory information should be collected and reported. Mild and moderate allergic patients should not be excluded from the vaccine as the exclusion of all these patients from vaccination may have a significant impact on reaching the goal of population immunity. Health care practitioners vaccinating against COVID-19 are required to be sufficiently prepared to recognise and treat anaphylaxis properly with the ability to administer adrenaline. A mandatory observation period after vaccine administration of at least 15 minutes for all individuals should be followed. The current data has not shown any higher risk for patients suffering from allergic rhinitis or asthma and this message should be clearly stated by physicians to give our patients trust. The benefit of the vaccination clearly outweighs the risk of severe COVID-19 development including the more than 30% of the population suffering from allergic diseases.","Klimek, Ludger; Jutel, Marek; Akdis, Cezmi A; Bousquet, Jean; Akdis, Mübeccel; Torres-Jaen, Maria; Agache, Ioana; Canonica, Giorgio W; Del Giacco, Stefano; O039,; Mahony, Liam; Shamji, Mohamed H; Pawankar, Ruby; Untersmayr, Eva; Ring, Johannes; Bedbrook, Anna; Worm, Margitta; Zuberbier, Torsten",Allergy,,550

504638,Significant physiological impact of wearing PPE inside operation theatre: A challenging scenario in this COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Since early 2020, global stakeholders have highlighted the significant gendered consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, including increases in the risk of gender-based violence (GBV). Researchers have sought to inform the pandemic response through a diverse set of methodologies, including early efforts modelling anticipated increases in GBV. For example, in April 2020, a highly cited modelling effort by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and partners projected headline global figures of 31 million additional cases of intimate partner violence due to 6 months of lockdown, and an additional 13 million child marriages by 2030. In this paper, we discuss the rationale for using modelling to make projections about GBV, and use the projections released by UNFPA to draw attention to the assumptions and biases underlying model-based projections. We raise five key critiques: (1) reducing complex issues to simplified, linear cause-effect relationships, (2) reliance on a small number of studies to generate global estimates, (3) assuming that the pandemic results in the complete service disruption for existing interventions, (4) lack of clarity in indicators used and sources of estimates, and (5) failure to account for margins of uncertainty. We argue that there is a need to consider the motivations and consequences of using modelling data as a planning tool for complex issues like GBV, and conclude by suggesting key considerations for policymakers and practitioners in using and commissioning such projections.","Lokot, Michelle; Bhatia, Amiya; Heidari, Shirin; Peterman, Amber",,,550

We investigated the link between TTE parameters and prognosis in COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to 24 French hospitals were retrospectively included. Comprehensive data, including clinical and biological parameters, were recorded at admission. Focused TTE was performed during hospitalization, according to clinical indication. Patients were followed for a primary composite outcome of death or transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) during hospitalization. Among 2878 patients, 445 (15%) underwent TTE. Most of these had cardiovascular risk factors, a history of cardiovascular disease, and were on cardiovascular treatments. Dilatation and dysfunction were observed in, respectively, 12% (48/412) and 23% (102/442) of patients for the left ventricle, and in 12% (47/407) and 16% (65/402) for the right ventricle (RV). Primary composite outcome occurred in 44% (n = 196) of patients [9% (n = 42) for death without ICU transfer and 35% (n = 154) for admission to ICU]. RV dilatation was the only TTE parameter associated with the primary outcome. After adjustment, male sex [hazard ratio (HR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 - 2.25; P = 0.02], higher body mass index (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.18; P = 0.01), anticoagulation (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 - 0.86; P = 0.01), and RV dilatation (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.05 - 2.64; P = 0.03) remained independently associated with the primary outcome. CONCLUSION: Echocardiographic evaluation of RV dilatation could be useful for assessing risk of severe COVID-19 developing in hospitalized patients.","Soulat-Dufour, Laurie; Fauvel, Charles; Weizman, Orianne; Barbe, Thomas; Pezel, Théo; Mika, Delphine; Cellier, Joffrey; Geneste, Laura; Panagides, Vassili; Marsou, Wassima; Deney, Antoine; Attou, Sabir; Delmotte, Thomas; Ribeyrolles, Sophie; Chemaly, Pascale; Karsenty, Clement; Giordano, Gauthier; Gautier, Alexandre; Duceau, Baptiste; Sutter, Willy; Chaumont, Corentin; Guilleminot, Pierre; Sagnard, Audrey; Pastier, Julie; Trimaille, Antonin; Bonnet, Guillaume; Canu, Marjorie; Coisne, Augustin; Cohen, Ariel",European heart journal.

510971,How has technology been used to deliver cardiac rehabilitation during the COVID-19 pandemic? An international cross-sectional survey of healthcare professionals conducted by the BACPR,2021,"The general problem in this paper is vertex (node) subset selection with the goal to contain an infection that spreads in a network. Instead of selecting the single most important node, this paper deals with the problem of selecting multiple nodes for removal. As compared to previous work on multiple-node selection, the trade-off between cost and benefit is considered. The benefit is measured in terms of increasing the epidemic threshold which is a measure of how difficult it is for an infection to spread in a network. The cost is measured in terms of the number and size of nodes to be removed or controlled. Already in its single-objective instance with a fixed number of $k$ nodes to be removed, the multiple vertex immunisation problems have been proven to be NP-hard. Several heuristics have been developed to approximate the problem. In this work, we compare meta-heuristic techniques with exact methods on the Shield-value, which is a sub-modular proxy for the maximal eigenvalue and used in the current state-of-the-art greedy node-removal strategies. We generalise it to the multi-objective case and replace the greedy algorithm by a quadratic program (QP), which then can be solved with exact QP solvers. The main contribution of this paper is the insight that, if time permits, exact and problem-specific methods approximation should be used, which are often far better than Pareto front approximations obtained by general meta-heuristics. Based on these, it will be more effective to develop strategies for controlling real-world networks when the goal is to prevent or contain epidemic outbreaks. This paper is supported by ready to use Python implementation of the optimization methods and datasets.","Emmerich, Michael; Nibbeling, Joost; Kefalas, Marios; Plaat, Aske",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.06488v1.pdf,550

Therefore, adaptations to normal care pathways are required. Here, we establish if implementation of a bespoke peri-operative care bundle for urgent elective surgery during a pandemic surge period can deliver a low COVID-19-associated complication profile. We present a single-centre retrospective cohort study from a tertiary care hospital of patients planned for urgent elective surgery during the initial COVID-19 surge in the UK between 29 March and 12 June 2020. Patients asymptomatic for COVID-19 were screened by oronasal swab and chest imaging (chest X-ray or computed tomography if aged &#8805; 18 years), proceeding to surgery if negative. COVID-19 positive patients at screening were delayed. Postoperatively, patients transitioning to COVID-19 positive status by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing were identified by an in-house tracking system and monitored for complications and death within 30 days of surgery. Out of 557 patients referred for surgery (230 (41.3%) women; median (IQR [range]) age 61 (48-72 [1-89])), 535 patients (96%) had COVID-19 screening, of which 13 were positive (2.4%, 95%CI 1.4-4.1%). Out of 512 patients subsequently undergoing surgery, 7 (1.4%) developed COVID-19 positive status (1.4%, 95%CI 0.7-2.8%) with one COVID-19-related death (0.2%, 95%CI 0.0-1.1%) within 30 days. Out of these seven patients, four developed pneumonia, of which two required invasive ventilation including one patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Low rates of COVID-19 infection and mortality in the elective surgical population can be achieved within a targeted care bundle. This should provide reassurance that elective surgery can continue, where possible, despite high community rates of COVID-19.","Kane, A D; Paterson, J; Pokhrel, S; Berry, S K; Monkhouse, D; Brand, J W; Ingram, M; Danjoux, G R",Anaesthesia,,550

The major roles of the protein include virulence, infectivity, ion channel activity, morphogenesis, and virus release. The coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is mutating rapidly, therefore, critical study of mutations in ORF3a is certainly important from the pathogenic perspective. Here, a sum of 175 non-synonymous mutations in the ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 were identified from 7194 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 available from NCBI database. Effects of these mutations on structural stability, and functions of ORF3a were also studied. Broadly, three different classes of mutations, such as neutral, disease, and mixed (neutral and disease) types of mutations were observed. Consecutive phenomena of mutations in ORF3a protein were studied based on the timeline of detection of the mutations. Considering the amino acid compositions of the ORF3a protein, twenty clusters were detected using the K-means clustering method. The present findings on 175 novel mutations of ORF3a proteins will extend our knowledge on ORF3a, a vital accessory protein in SARS-CoV-2, to enlighten the pathogenicity of this life-threatening virus.","Hassan, Sk Sarif; Attrish, Diksha; Ghosh, Shinjini; Choudhury, Pabitra Pal; Roy, Bidyut",Virus Res,,550

Dentists have been highly affected by such measures, as they represent an easy source of contagion. As perceived job insecurity is associated with psychological distress and Italian dentists have been highly affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of potential financial loss and the risk of being infected, this study aimed at assessing whether the fear of COVID-19 moderated the effect of perceived job insecurity on depressive symptoms. This cross-sectional online study has included 735 Italian dentists recruited during the lockdown and ranging in age from 27 to 70 years old (495 men and 240 women). A quantile regression model with an inference based on the median and with an interaction term between the fear of COVID-19 and perceived job insecurity has been used to estimate the hypothesized associations. The results indicated that both perceived job insecurity and fear of COVID-19 were positively associated with depressive symptoms, and that the effect of perceived job insecurity on depressive symptoms was weaker among those with a low fear of COVID-19. The findings may inform public health policies for dentists in relation to reducing the risk of developing negative mental health outcomes.","Gasparro, Roberta; Scandurra, Cristiano; Maldonato, Nelson Mauro; Dolce, Pasquale; Bochicchio, Vincenzo; Valletta, Alessandra; Sammartino, Gilberto; Sammartino, Pasquale; Mariniello, Mauro; di Lauro, Alessandro Espedito; Marenzi, Gaetano",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32722202/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17155338,550

Whether such symptoms correlate with immune responses, and how long immunity persists, is not yet clear. This study focused on mild COVID-19 and investigated correlations of immunity with persistent symptoms and immune longevity. Persistent complications, including headache, concentration difficulties and loss of smell/taste, were reported by 51 of 83 (61%) participants and decreased over time to 28% one year after COVID-19. Specific IgA and IgG antibodies were detectable in 78% and 66% of participants, respectively, at a 12-month follow-up. Median antibody levels decreased by approximately 50% within the first 6 months but remained stable up to 12 months. Neutralizing antibodies could be found in 50% of participants; specific INFgamma-producing T-cells were present in two thirds one year after COVID-19. Activation-induced marker assays identified specific T-helper cells and central memory T-cells in 80% of participants at a 12-month follow-up. In correlative analyses, older age and a longer duration of the acute phase of COVID-19 were associated with higher humoral and T-cell responses. A weak correlation between long-term loss of taste/smell and low IgA levels was found at early time points.

AIM: The current study aimed to evaluate the psychological issues among the health-care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey using Survey Monkey(®) platform was carried out to evaluate depression (using Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (using Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-7), and other psychological issues (using a self-designed questionnaire). RESULTS: The study sample comprised 303 participants with a mean age of 41.2 (standard deviation: 11.1) years. A majority of them were male (69%) and married (79.9%). Nearly half (46.2%) of the participants had either anxiety disorder or depression or both and 12.9% of HCW had suicidal behavior. Higher level of anxiety and depression scores were associated with being female, having undergone quarantine, directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients, and younger age (<30 years). Higher prevalence of depression and anxiety disorder was seen in younger (<30 years) age group, being a doctor (compared to paramedics). In addition, higher prevalence of depression was seen in those who were directly involved in the care of patients with COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: About half of the HCWs are suffering from psychiatric morbidity, specifically anxiety, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need to assess all the HCWs for psychiatric morbidity and provide them with psychological support.","Grover, Sandeep; Mehra, Aseem; Sahoo, Swapnajeet; Avasthi, Ajit; Rao, T. S.

Only bearing in mind the contamination and concerns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and environmental emissions, the worth of herbal medicine wastes management and conversion to green products can be understood. In this work, subcritical water treatment was carried out batch-wise in a stainless tube reactor in the pressure range of 0.792-30.0 MPa, varying the temperature (127-327 °C) and time (1-60 min) of extraction. This resulted in new and green material sources, including organic acids, amino acids, and sugars. Amazingly, at very low extraction times (below 5 min) and high temperatures (above 277 °C), about 99% of HMWs were efficaciously converted to clean products by subcritical hydrothermal treatment. The results of hydrothermal extraction after 5 min indicated that at low temperatures (127-227 °C), the total organic carbon in the aqueous phase increased as the residual solid phase decreased, reaching a peak around 220 °C.

Little is known about the response to COVID-19 and the impact it has on incomes, livelihoods and knowledge and practice in the coastal artisanal fishers communities of Bangladesh. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the socio-demographics of selected coastal fishers, their knowledge about COVID-19 and the preventive practice taken to reduce it. The impact on their fishing habits and income was also examined to determine potential policy areas. Data were collected via a structured questionnaire from 250 respondents from three coastal districts, Cox’s Bazar, Patuakhali and Barguna, Bangladesh during April–June 2020. The research shows that the fishers’ knowledge about COVID-19 and measures taken to reduce it were significantly higher in Patuakhali and Barguna than in Cox’s Bazar. The pandemic caused lower consumer demand, reduced fish prices and created fish transportation issues due to movement restrictions enforced during the lockdown. Irrespective of geographical location, fishing trips were reduced by frequency and duration compared with the pre-COVID-19 period, consequently lowering the income of fishers. Fishers have received little or no support from private, non-governmental or governmental sources. Considering the evidence in this paper of economic hardship, this paper recommends artisanal fishers in Bangladesh should be provided with support to improve their health education, access to professional health facilities and financial services. This will contribute to improved food security and sustainable livelihoods that can better withstand local and/or global crises.","Hoque, Md.

The World Health Organization (WHO) responded to this in 2018 by publishing an inaugural broad classification framework of digital health interventions (DHIs) used to address contemporary health system needs. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the systematic development of dual survey instruments (clinician and patient) to support data collection, administered in a physiotherapy setting, about perceptions toward DHIs. This is achieved by adapting the WHO framework classification for DHIs for application in real-world research. METHODS: Using a qualitative item review approach, WHO DHI descriptors were adapted and refined systematically to be used in a survey form. This approach was designed to align with the processes of delivering and receiving care in clinical practice, using musculoskeletal physiotherapy as a practical case scenario. RESULTS: Complementary survey instruments (for health care providers and clients) were developed by adapting descriptor items. These instruments will be used in a larger study exploring the willingness of physiotherapists and patients to use digital technologies in the management of musculoskeletal conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This study builds on the WHO-standardized DHI framework. We developed dual novel survey instruments by adapting and refining the functions of DHIs. These may be deployed to explore the perceived usefulness and application of DHIs for different clinical care functions. Researchers may wish to use these survey instruments to examine digital health use systematically in a variety of clinical fields or technology scenarios in a way that is standardized and generalizable.","Merolli, Mark; Hinman, Rana S; Lawford, Belinda J; Choo, Dawn; Gray, Kathleen",JMIR Res Protoc,https://doi.org/10.2196/25177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34319242/,550

We suggest remote research designs that maximize benefit for participants, which could have implications for control groups. Researchers should plan for flexibility in their methods for remote research and must not assume all participants will be able to videoconference; telephone-only research is possible. We recommend performing an assessment of information communication technology infrastructure and prior exposure to this technology with each participant before making a final choice on remote methods for research. In general, researchers should adapt their methods for remote research to each participant rather than requesting participants to adapt to the researchers. Screening for sensory loss should be conducted, and the impact of this on the use of technology for remote research should be considered.

Thus, pharmacy students need to be adequately trained and assessed in health-literacy skills to be competent for future patient-education consultations using medicines lists. Performance-based assessments using patient simulation are often utilized to examine students’ competence in clinical knowledge and communication skills. Due to COVID-19, education systems changed to remote online delivery utilizing video conferencing platforms (i.e., Zoom(TM)), which proved challenging for performance-based assessments. These challenges include difficulty in observing non-verbal cues over Zoom(TM) and not having adequate internet access. Adaptations to reduce reliance on internet access were made where students submitted a video-recording task wherein they educated a simulated patient on a medicines list, under lockdown restrictions during the pandemic. A total of 304 submissions were received where students performed the role-play with a simulated patient, such as their family members, housemates or peers either at home in person or via Zoom(TM).

Typically this involves two components: (i) Using time series methods to model the baseline background distribution (the time series process that is assumed to contain no outbreak signatures), (ii) Detecting outbreak signatures using filter-based time series methods. METHODS: We consider time series models for chest radiograph data obtained from Midwest children's emergency departments. These models incorporate available covariate information such as patient visit counts and smoothed ambient temperature series, as well as time series dependencies on daily and weekly seasonal scales. Respiratory-related outbreak signature detection is based on filtering the one-step-ahead prediction errors obtained from the time series models for the respiratory-complaint background. RESULTS: Using simulation experiments based on a stochastic model for an anthrax attack, we illustrate the effect of the choice of filter and the statistical models upon radiograph-attributed outbreak signature detection. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the importance of using seasonal autoregressive integrated average time series models (SARIMA) with covariates in the modeling of respiratory-related time series data. We find some homogeneity in the time series models for the respiratory-complaint backgrounds across the Midwest emergency departments studied. Our simulations show that the balance between specificity, sensitivity, and timeliness to detect an outbreak signature differs by the emergency department and the choice of filter. The linear and exponential filters provide a good balance.","Craigmile, Peter F; Kim, Namhee; Fernandez, Soledad A; Bonsu, Bema K",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17919318/,550
598079,Case Reports of COVID 19 Recurrence,2021-02-13,"COVID‐19 mitigating practices such as ‘hand‐washing’, ‘social distancing’, or ‘social isolating’ are constructed as ‘moral imperatives’, required to avert harm to oneself and others. Adherence to COVID‐19 mitigating practices is presently high among the general public, and stringent lockdown measures supported by legal and policy intervention have facilitated this. In the coming months, however, as rules are being relaxed and individuals become less strict, and thus, the ambiguity in policy increases, the maintenance of recommended social distancing norms will rely on more informal social interactional processes. We argue that the moralization of these practices, twinned with relaxations of policy, may likely cause interactional tension between those individuals who do vs. those who do not uphold social distancing in the coming months: that is, derogation of those who adhere strictly to COVID‐19 mitigating practices and group polarization between ‘distancers’ and ‘non‐distancers’.

Parents reported also children’s emotional regulation and lability/negativity. A structural equation model (SEM) using MPLUS 8.3 was tested. Results showed that the hypothesized model exhibited excellent fit, chi-square (83) = 140.40, p < 0.01, RMSEA = 0.05, CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.96, SRMR = 0.04. The influences of parents’ psychological distress and parents’ regulatory emotional self-efficacy on children’s emotional regulation and lability/negativity were mediated by parenting self-efficacy. The mediation model was invariant across children’s biological sex and age, and geographical residence area (high risk vs. low risk for COVID-19). Results suggested how parents’ beliefs to be competent in managing parental tasks might be a protective factor for their children’s emotional well-being. Implications for intervention programs are discussed.","Morelli, Mara; Cattelino, Elena; Baiocco, Roberto; Trumello, Carmen; Babore, Alessandra; Candelori, Carla; Chirumbolo, Antonio",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33123063/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.584645,550
601058,The Role of Digital Technology in Responding to COVID-19 Pandemic: Saudi Arabia’s Experience,2021-09-21,"The main pathophysiological mechanism of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) invovles the increase in alveolar barrier permeability that is primarily caused by epithelial glycocalyx and tight junction (TJ) protein destruction. This study was performed to explore the effects of the alveolar epithelial glycocalyx on the epithelial barrier, specifically on TJ proteins, in ARDS. We used C57BL/6 mice and human lung epithelial cell models of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS. Changes in alveolar permeability were evaluated via pulmonary histopathology analysis and by measuring the wet/dry weight ratio of the lungs. Degradation of heparan sulfate (HS), an important component of the epithelial glycocalyx, and alterations in levels of the epithelial TJ proteins (occludin, zonula occludens 1, and claudin 4) were assessed via ELISA, immunofluorescence analysis, and western blotting analysis. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the mRNA of the TJ protein. Changes in glycocalyx and TJ ultrastructures in alveolar epithelial cells were evaluated through electron microscopy. In vivo and in vitro, LPS increased the alveolar permeability and led to HS degradation and TJ damage. After LPS stimulation, the expression of the HS-degrading enzyme heparanase (HPA) in the alveolar epithelial cells was increased. The HPA inhibitor N-desulfated/re-N-acetylated heparin alleviated LPS-induced HS degradation and reduced TJ damage. In vitro, recombinant HPA reduced the expression of the TJ protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and inhibited its mRNA expression in the alveolar epithelial cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that shedding of the alveolar epithelial glycocalyx aggravates the epithelial barrier and damages epithelial TJ proteins in ARDS, with the underlying mechanism involving the effect of HPA on ZO-1.","Li, Jun; Qi, Zhijiang; Li, Dongxiao; Huang, Xiao; Qi, Boyang; Feng, Jiali; Qu, Jianyu; Wang, Xiaozhi",Biomed Pharmacother,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S075333222031218X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.111026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S075333222031218X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33378942/,550

The population and workforce is aging in all countries of the world. It is widely recognized that older individuals show an increased susceptibility to infections and a reduced response to vaccination suggesting that the aged immune system is less able to react and consequently protect the organism. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is dramatically showing us that the organism reacts to novel pathogens in an age-dependent manner. The decline of the immune system observed in aging remains unclear. We aimed to understand the role of B cells. We analyzed peripheral blood from children (4-18 years); young people (23-60 years) and elderly people (65-91 years) by flow cytometry. We also measured antibody secretion by ELISA following a T-independent stimulation. Here we show that the elderly have a significant reduction of CD27(dull) memory B cells, a population that bridges innate and adaptive immune functions. In older people, memory B cells are mostly high specialized antigen-selected CD27(bright). Moreover, after in vitro stimulation with CpG, B cells from older individuals produced significantly fewer IgM and IgA antibodies compared to younger individuals. Aging is a complex process characterized by a functional decline in multiple physiological systems. The immune system of older people is well equipped to react to often encountered antigens but has a low ability to respond to new pathogens.","Ciocca, Michela; Zaffina, Salvatore; Fernandez Salinas, Ane; Bocci, Chiara; Palomba, Patrizia; Conti, Maria Giulia; Terreri, Sara; Frisullo, Giuseppe; Giorda, Ezio; Scarsella, Marco; Brugaletta, Rita; Vinci, Maria Rosaria; Magnavita, Nicola; Carsetti, Rita; Piano Mortari, Eva",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.690534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367150/,550

Due to its high transmission rate and the significant time–space between infection and manifestation of symptoms, the WHO recently declared this a pandemic. Because of the exponentially growing number of new cases of both infections and deaths, development of new therapeutic options to help fight this pandemic is urgently needed. The target molecules of this study were the nitro derivatives of quinoline and quinoline N-oxide. Computational design at the DFT level, docking studies, and molecular dynamics methods as a well-reasoned strategy will aid in elucidating the fundamental physicochemical properties and molecular functions of a diversity of compounds, directly accelerating the process of discovering new drugs. In this study, we discovered isomers based on the nitro derivatives of quinoline and quinoline N-oxide, which are biologically active compounds and may be low-cost alternatives for the treatment of infections induced by SARS-CoV-2.","Assis, Letícia C.; de Castro, Alexandre A.; de Jesus, João P.

602826,Risk Perception Towards COVID-19 and Its Associated Factors Among Waiters in Selected Towns of Southwest Ethiopia,2020-11-13,"Given that mobile phone usage has increased rapidly throughout the world, one possibility to increase parental involvement in monitoring their children’s progression is to train parents or primary caregivers on the use of mobile phone technology to track their children’s developmental milestones. The current paper aimed to describe the development of a mobile phone application for use among primary caregivers and establish the feasibility and preliminary impact of caregivers using a mobile phone application to track the progression of their children’s development in a context where there is a paucity of similar studies. This study is a substudy that focusses on the intervention group only of a recently completed two-armed quasi-experimental study in an informal settlement in Nairobi. The mobile phone application which consisted of questions on children’s developmental progression, as well as stimulation messages, was developed through a step-wise approach. The questions covered five child developmental domains: communication; fine motor; gross motor; personal-social; and, problem-solving. Depending on the response received, the child would be classified as having ‘achieved a milestone’ or ‘milestone not achieved.’ If a child had achieved the milestone for a specific age, a caregiver would receive an SMS on how to stimulate the child to achieve the next milestone. Where the milestone was not achieved, the caregiver would get a message to enhance development in the area of delay. Caregivers with children aged between six months and two years were recruited into the study and received questions and messages regarding their children’s development (age-specific) on a monthly basis for 12 months. Caregiver adherence to the intervention was above 90% in the first three months of implementation. Thereafter, the response rate fluctuated between 76% and 86% across the subsequent months of the intervention. The high level and fairly stable caregivers’ rate of response to the 12 rounds of messaging indicated feasibility of the mobile technology. Further, in the first three months of intervention implementation, the majority of caregivers were able to keep track of how their children attained their developmental milestones. The intervention seems to be scalable, practical and potentially low-cost because of the wide coverage of phones.","Kitsao-Wekulo, Patricia; Kipkoech Langat, Nelson; Nampijja, Margaret; Mwaniki, Elizabeth; Okelo, Kenneth; Kimani-Murage, Elizabeth",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34265009/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254621,550

METHODS: Bibliographic databases were searched to identify all studies documenting, in adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): (1) the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid in the feces; (2) the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid in the intestinal cells; (3) live SARS-CoV-2 in the feces. RESULTS: Twenty seven met the inclusion criteria. In 26 studies, the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid in the feces of COVID-19 patients had been reported. Out of the 671 patients, 312 (46.5%) had a positive stool sample for viral nucleic acid. Of these patients, 63.9% remained positive for viral nucleic acid in the feces after pharyngeal swabs became negative; Three studies also evaluated the viral ribonucleic acid in the gastrointestinal tissues and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was found in samples of 3 patients out of 8 examined (37.5%). The presence of the live virus in stool samples was confirmed in two studies but no in in a recent study from Germany. These results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect gastrointestinal epithelial cells and it may be transmitted through the digestive tract.

The aim of this study was to develop and assess a set of vaccination belief scales in relation to COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between July 2020 and January 2021 using a systematic random sampling of 425 adult outpatients at two hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. An instrument was designed based on the dimensional structure and wording of the health belief model (HBM), which was followed by the assessment of the instrument’s internal consistency and the construct validity. RESULTS: The 15-item instrument showed the content validity index (CVI) of scales reached a value of 1.0. Exploratory factor analysis was performed on the first sample (n = 170) and extracted 12 out of 15 draft items in a four-factor model (threat of disease, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and cues to action) that accounted for 68.3% of the total variance. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.765 showed as satisfactory. Following this, the confirmatory factor analysis in the remaining sample (n = 255) found a good fit between a four-factor model and a theoretical model of HBM with acceptable values of fit indices. CONCLUSION: Beliefs scales for COVID-19 vaccination have been determined to be valid and reliable. They can be a helpful instrument for health educators to use for assessing immunization beliefs of individuals and the public where there is the need to implement new vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccine, before they are used more widely across the community.","Huynh, Giao; Nguyen, Han Thi Ngoc; Nguyen, Vien Truong; Pham, An Le",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34163271/; https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s301645,550

The systemic antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients has been extensively studied. However, much less is known about the mucosal responses in the upper airways at the site of initial SARS-CoV-2 replication. Local antibody responses in the nasopharyngeal epithelium, that are likely to determine the course of infection, have not been analysed so far nor their correlation with antibody responses in serum. Methods. The IgG and IgA antibody responses were analysed in the plasma as well as in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from the first four COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-qPCR in France. Two were pauci-symptomatic while two developed severe disease. Taking advantage of a comprehensive series of plasma and nasopharyngeal samples, we characterized their antibody profiles from the second week post symptoms onset, by using an in-house ELISA to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein (N) IgG and IgA. Results. Anti-N IgG and IgA antibodies were detected in the NPS of severe patients. Overall, the levels of IgA and IgG antibodies in plasma and NPS appeared specific to each patient. Conclusions. Anti-N IgG and IgA antibodies are detected in NPS, and their levels are related to antibody levels in plasma. The two patients with severe disease exhibited different antibody profiles that may reflect different disease outcome. For the pauci-symptomatic patients, one showed a low anti-N IgG and IgA response in the plasma only, while the other one did not exhibit overt serological response.","Crescenzo-Chaigne, B.; Behillil, S.; Enouf, V.; Escriou, N.; Petres, S.; Ungeheuer, M.

However, to date, few studies have reported simple risk assessment tools for distinguishing patients becoming severely ill after initial diagnosis. Hence, this study aimed to develop a simple clinical risk nomogram predicting oxygenation risk in patients with COVID-19 at the first triage. Methods This retrospective study involved a chart review of the medical records of 84 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 2020 and March 2021 at ten medical facilities. The patients were divided into requiring no oxygen therapy (non-severe group) and requiring oxygen therapy (severe group). Patient characteristics were compared between the two groups. We utilized univariate logistic regression analysis to confirm determinants of high risks of requiring oxygen therapy in patients with moderate COVID-19. Results Thirty-five patients ware in severe group and forty-nine patients were in non-severe group. In comparison with patients in the non-severe group, patients in the severe group were significantly older with higher body mass index (BMI), and had a history of hypertension and diabetes. Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly higher in the severe group. Multivariate analysis showed that older age, higher BMI, and higher BUN levels were significantly associated with oxygen requirements. Conclusions This study demonstrated that age, BMI, and BUN were independent risk factors in the moderate-to-severe COVID-19 group. Elderly patients with higher BMI and BUN require close monitoring and early treatment initiation.","Norihiko, Goto; Wada, Yosuke; Ikuyama, Yuichi; Akahane, Jumpei; Kosaka, Makoto; Ushiki, Atsuhito; Kitaguchi, Yoshiaki; Yasuo, Masanori; Yamamoto, Hiroshi; Matsuo, Akemi; Hachiya, Tsutomu; Ideura, Gen; Yamazaki, Yoshitaka; Hanaoka, Masayuki",J Infect Chemother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34412984/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X2100221X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X2100221X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2021.08.009,550

We assessed the impact of Washington State's exposure notification tool, WA Notify, in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 during its first four months of implementation. Methods Due to the constraints of privacy-preservation and anonymized data, aggregate metrics and disparate data sources were utilized to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases averted based on a modelling approach adapted from Wymant et al (2021) using the following parameters: number of notifications generated; the probability that a notified individual goes on to become a case; expected fraction of transmissions preventable by strict quarantine after notification; actual adherence to quarantine; and expected size of the full transmission chain if a contact had not been notified. Results The model was run on a range of secondary attack rates (5.1%-13.706%) and quarantine effectiveness (53% and 64%). Assuming a 12.085% secondary attack rate and 53% quarantine effectiveness, the model shows that 6240 cases were averted statewide during the first four months of its implementation. Based on an estimated COVID-19 case fatality of 1.4%, WA Notify saved 30-120 lives during the study period. Conclusions These findings demonstrate the potential value of exposure notification tools as a novel public health intervention to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. As new variants emerge and non-essential travel bans are lifted, exposure notification tools may continue to play a valuable role in limiting the spread of COVID-19.","Segal, C.; Zhang, Z.; Karras, B.

RECENT FINDINGS: Several hundred studies provide powerful evidence that body mass index (BMI) is a strong linear risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes, with recent studies suggesting ~5-10% higher risk for COVID-19 hospitalisation per every kg/m(2) higher BMI. Genetic data concur with hazard ratios increasing by 14% per every kg/m(2) higher BMI. BMI to COVID-19 links differ markedly from prior BMI-infection associations and are further supported as likely causal by multiple biologically plausible pathways.

As the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID‐19 have many parallels with influenza, it is important to ensure optimal management of both respiratory diseases as we anticipate their continued co‐circulation. In particular, there is a need to ensure that effective surveillance and diagnostic capacities are in place to monitor these and other respiratory viruses, as this will underpin decisions on the appropriate clinical management of the respective diseases. As such, we propose a series of key recommendations for stakeholders, public health authorities, primary care physicians and surveillance bodies that will help mitigate the combined risks of concurrent influenza epidemics and the COVID‐19 pandemic. We advocate the judicious use of influenza vaccines and antivirals, particularly among groups at high risk of complications, with healthcare workers also considered a priority for vaccination. It is likely that the increased use of emerging technologies such as telemedicine and contact tracing will permanently change our approach to managing infectious disease. The use of these technologies, alongside existing pharmaceutical strategies, will ensure that we achieve a holistic approach to the global public health measures needed to deal with the combined threat of influenza and COVID‐19.

The second DL was trained with 406-pixel patches and applied to the recognized X-ray radiographs to localize and assign them into the left lung, right lung or bipulmonary. X-ray radiographs of CAP and healthy controls were enrolled to evaluate the robustness of the model. Compared to the radiologists’ discrimination and localization results, the accuracy of COVID-19 discrimination using the Discrimination-DL yielded 98.71%, while the accuracy of localization using the Localization-DL was 93.03%. This work represents the feasibility of using a novel deep learning-based CAD scheme to efficiently and accurately distinguish COVID-19 from CAP and detect localization with high accuracy and agreement with radiologists.","Wang, Zheng; Xiao, Ying; Li, Yong; Zhang, Jie; Lu, Fanggen; Hou, Muzhou; Liu, Xiaowei",Pattern Recognit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32868956/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2020.107613; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0031320320304167; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320320304167?v=s5,550

611004,Health Insurance Status and Risk Factors for Poor Outcomes With COVID-19 Among U.S. Health Care Workers: A Cross-sectional Study,2020-04-28,"BACKGROUND: In Brazil, a substantial number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases and deaths have been reported. It has become the second most affected country worldwide, as of June 9, 2020. Official Brazilian government sources present contradictory data on the impact of the disease; thus, it is possible that the actual number of infected individuals and deaths in Brazil is far larger than those officially reported. It is very likely that the actual spread of the disease has been underestimated. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the underreporting of cases and deaths related to COVID-19 in the most affected cities in Brazil, based on public data available from official Brazilian government internet portals, to identify the actual impact of the pandemic. METHODS: We used data from historical deaths due to respiratory problems and other natural causes from two public portals: DATASUS (Department of Informatics of the Unified Healthcare System) (2010-2018) and the Brazilian Transparency Portal of Civil Registry (2019-2020). These data were used to build time-series models (modular regressions) to predict the expected mortality patterns for 2020. The forecasts were used to estimate the possible number of deaths that were incorrectly registered during the pandemic and posted on government internet portals in the most affected cities in the country. RESULTS: Our model found a significant difference between the real and expected values. The number of deaths due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was considerably higher in all cities, with increases between 493% and 5820%. This sudden increase may be associated with errors in reporting. An average underreporting of 40.68% (range 25.9%-62.7%) is estimated for COVID-19–related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The significant rates of underreporting of deaths analyzed in our study demonstrate that officially released numbers are much lower than actual numbers, making it impossible for the authorities to implement a more effective pandemic response. Based on analyses carried out using different fatality rates, it can be inferred that Brazil’s epidemic is worsening, and the actual number of infectees could already be between 1 to 5.4 million.","Veiga e Silva, Lena; de Andrade Abi Harb, Maria Da Penha; Teixeira Barbosa dos Santos, Aurea Milene; de Mattos Teixeira, Carlos André; Macedo Gomes, Vitor Hugo; Silva Cardoso, Evelin Helena; S da Silva, Marcelino; Vijaykumar, N L; Venâncio Carvalho, Solon; Ponce de Leon Ferreira de Carvalho, André; Lisboa Frances, Carlos Renato",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/21413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32730219/,550

Based on the publicly available surveillance data, we identified 21 transmission chains in Hong Kong and estimated the serial interval (SI) of COVID-19. MethodsIndex cases were identified and reported after symptoms onset, and contact tracing was conducted to collect the data of the associated secondary cases. An interval censored likelihood framework is adopted to fit a Gamma distribution function to govern the SI of COVID-19. FindingsAssuming a Gamma distributed model, we estimated the mean of SI at 4.4 days (95%CI: 2.9-6.7) and SD of SI at 3.0 days (95%CI: 1.8-5.8) by using the information of all 21 transmission chains in Hong Kong. ConclusionThe SI of COVID-19 may be shorter than the preliminary estimates in previous works. Given the likelihood that SI could be shorter than the incubation period, pre-symptomatic transmission may occur, and extra efforts on timely contact tracing and quarantine are recommended in combating the COVID-19 outbreak.","Zhao, Shi; Gao, Daozhou; Zhuang, Zian; Chong, Marc; Cai, Yongli; Ran, Jinjun; Cao, Peihua; Wang, Kai; Lou, Yijun; Wang, Weiming; Yang, Lin; He, Daihai; Wang, Maggie",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026559,550

Hospitalization and early treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (HCQ-AZ) was proposed for the positive cases. METHODS: We retrospectively report the clinical management of 3,737 screened patients, including 3,119 (83.5%) treated with HCQ-AZ (200 mg of oral HCQ, three times daily for ten days and 500 mg of oral AZ on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for the next four days, respectively) for at least three days and 618 (16.5%) patients treated with other regimen (“others”). Outcomes were death, transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU), ≥10 days of hospitalization and viral shedding. RESULTS: The patients’ mean age was 45 (sd 17) years, 45% were male, and the case fatality rate was 0.9%. We performed 2,065 low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans highlighting lung lesions in 592 of the 991 (59.7%) patients with minimal clinical symptoms (NEWS score = 0). A discrepancy between spontaneous dyspnoea, hypoxemia and lung lesions was observed. Clinical factors (age, comorbidities, NEWS-2 score), biological factors (lymphocytopenia; eosinopenia; decrease in blood zinc; and increase in D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine phosphokinase, and C-reactive protein) and moderate and severe lesions detected in low-dose CT scans were associated with poor clinical outcome. Treatment with HCQ-AZ was associated with a decreased risk of transfer to ICU or death (Hazard ratio (HR) 0.18 0.11–0.27), decreased risk of hospitalization ≥10 days (odds ratios 95% CI 0.38 0.27–0.54) and shorter duration of viral shedding (time to negative PCR: HR 1.29 1.17–1.42). QTc prolongation (>60 ms) was observed in 25 patients (0.67%) leading to the cessation of treatment in 12 cases including 3 cases with QTc> 500 ms. No cases of torsade de pointe or sudden death were observed. CONCLUSION: Although this is a retrospective analysis, results suggest that early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment of COVID-19 patients, with at least 3 days of HCQ-AZ lead to a significantly better clinical outcome and a faster viral load reduction than other treatments.","Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Million, Matthieu; Gautret, Philippe; Colson, Philippe; Cortaredona, Sébastien; Giraud-Gatineau, Audrey; Honoré, Stéphane; Gaubert, Jean-Yves; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Tissot-Dupont, Hervé; Chabrière, Eric; Stein, Andreas; Deharo, Jean-Claude; Fenollar, Florence; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Obadia, Yolande; Jacquier, Alexis; La Scola, Bernard; Brouqui, Philippe; Drancourt, Michel; Parola, Philippe; Raoult, Didier",Travel Med Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32593867/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101791; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920302817?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893920302817,550

Demographic features, clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, interferon-gamma (IFN γ), interleukin (IL-2), IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 levels were compared between the groups. Additionally, a correlation analysis was performed in the study group for the assessment of IFN γ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 levels with disease severity and CRP levels. Results Study group had significantly higher pregnancy complication rate, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, IFN γ, and IL-6 values (p<0.05). On the other hand, the control group had significantly higher hemoglobin, leukocyte, platelet, lymphocyte, IL-2, IL-10, and IL-17 values (p<0.05).

Here we assayed both antibody and T-cell reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in COVID-19 convalescent patients and healthy donors sampled before and during the pandemic. Our results show that while anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can distinguish convalescent patients from healthy donors, the magnitude of T-cell response was more pronounced in healthy donors sampled during COVID-19 pandemic than in donors sampled before the outbreak. This hints at the possibility that some individuals have encountered the virus but were protected by T-cell cross-reactivity observed. A public and diverse T-cell response was observed for two A*02-restricted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, revealing a set of T-cell receptor motifs displaying germline-encoded features. Bulk CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S is characterized by multiple groups of homologous T-cell receptor sequences some of which are shared across multiple donors, indicating the existence of immunodominant epitopes. Overall, our findings indicate that T cells form an efficient response to SARS-CoV-2 and alongside the antibodies can serve as a useful biomarker for surveying SARS-CoV-2 exposure and immunity. We hope that data, including the set of specific T-cell receptors identified in this study can serve as a basis for future developments of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations and monitoring.","Shomuradova, A.

These patients have a higher 5-year morbidity and mortality and greater utilization of healthcare resources. This well-documented deterioration in physical, cognitive and/or psychological health in critical care survivors is known as post intensive care syndrome (PICS) which has personal and socioeconomic implications not only for the patient, but also for their families, care givers and society. Greater awareness of the impact of critical illness on quality of life has led to the emergence of research focused on overall patient outcomes rather than crude survival. National guidelines state personal rehabilitation programmes involving a multidisciplinary team should be commenced within 4 days of admission and continued after discharge to the ward. Once discharged home specialist ICU follow-up clinics are key in identifying any long-term complications of critical care admission and should focus on all aspects of the PICS. COVID-19 has highlighted PICS on a national level with patients experiencing multiple long-term complications of critical illness, some as yet unknown.","Morgan, Amy",Surgery (Oxf),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mpsur.2020.11.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263931920302386; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0263931920302386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519011/,550

Food poisoning from Clostridium botulinum has emerged as a very rare potential cause of small bowel obstruction. The relevance of this case report regards the subtle onset of pathognomonic neurological symptoms, which can delay diagnosis and subsequent life-saving treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old man came to our Emergency Department complaining of abdominal pain, fever and sporadic self-limiting episodes of diplopia, starting 4 days earlier. Clinical presentation and radiological imaging suggested a case of small bowel obstruction. Non-operative management was adopted, which was followed by worsening of neurological signs. On specifically questioning the patient, we discovered that his parents had experienced similar, but milder symptoms. The patient also recalled eating home-made preserves some days earlier. A clinical diagnosis of foodborne botulism was established and antitoxin was promptly administered with rapid clinical resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Though very rare, botulism can mimic small bowel obstruction, and could be associated with a rapid clinical deterioration if misdiagnosed.

619564,Protecting healthcare workers from COVID-19: learning from variation in practice and policy identified through a global cross-sectional survey,2020-05-21,"During flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) the arterial partial pressure of oxygen can drop, increasing the risk for respiratory failure. To avoid desaturation episodes during the procedure several oxygenation strategies have been proposed, including conventional oxygen therapy (COT), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV). By a review of the current literature, we merely describe the clinical practice of oxygen therapies during FOB. We also conducted a pooled data analysis with respect to oxygenation outcomes, comparing HFNC with COT and NIV, separately. COT showed its benefits in patients undergoing FOB for broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) or brushing for cytology, in those with peripheral arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation < 93% prior to the procedure or affected by obstructive disorder. HFNC is preferable over COT in patients with mild to moderate acute respiratory failure (ARF) undergoing FOB, by improving oxygen saturation and decreasing the episodes of desaturation.

619963,Factors influencing study engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study among health and social professions students,2021-07-27,"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), a novel coronavirus causing life-threatening pneumonia, caused a pandemic starting in 2019 and caused unprecedented economic and health crises all over the globe. This requires the rapid discovery of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates to overcome this life-threatening pandemic. Strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) and ginger (Zingiber officinale) methanolic extracts were used for silver nanoparticle (AgNPs) synthesis to explore their SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory potential. Moreover, an in silico study was performed to explore the possible chemical compounds that might be responsible for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential. The characterization of the green synthesized AgNPs was carried out with transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared, spectroscopy ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, zeta potential, and a dynamic light-scattering technique. The metabolic profiling of strawberry and ginger methanolic extract was assessed using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. The antiviral potential against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated using an MTT assay. Moreover, in silico modeling and the molecular dynamic study were conducted via AutoDock Vina to demonstrate the potential of the dereplicated compounds to bind to some of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The TEM analysis of strawberry and ginger AgNPs showed spherical nanoparticles with mean sizes of 5.89 nm and 5.77 nm for strawberry and ginger, respectively. The UV-Visible spectrophotometric analysis showed an absorption peak at λmax of 400 nm for strawberry AgNPs and 405 nm for ginger AgNPs. The Zeta potential values of the AgNPs of the methanolic extract of strawberry was −39.4 mV, while for AgNPs of ginger methanolic extract it was −42.6 mV, which indicates a high stability of the biosynthesized nanoparticles. The strawberry methanolic extract and the green synthesized AgNPs of ginger showed the highest antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Dereplication of the secondary metabolites from the crude methanolic extracts of strawberry and ginger resulted in the annotation of different classes of compounds including phenolic, flavonoids, fatty acids, sesquiterpenes, triterpenes, sterols, and others. The docking study was able to predict the different patterns of interaction between the different compounds of strawberry and ginger with seven SARS-CoV-2 protein targets including five viral proteins (Mpro, ADP ribose phosphatase, NSP14, NSP16, PLpro) and two humans (AAK1, Cathepsin L). The molecular docking and dynamics simulation study showed that neohesperidin demonstrated the potential to bind to both human AAK1 protein and SARS-CoV-2 NSP16 protein, which makes this compound of special interest as a potential dual inhibitor. Overall, the present study provides promise for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 green synthesized AgNPs, which could be developed in the future into a new anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug.","Al-Sanea, Mohammad M.; Abelyan, Narek; Abdelgawad, Mohamed A.; Musa, Arafa; Ghoneim, Mohammed M.; Al-Warhi, Tarfah; Aljaeed, Nada; Alotaibi, Ohoud J.; Alnusaire, Taghreed S.; Abdelwahab, Sayed F.; Helmy, Aya; Abdelmohsen, Usama Ramadan; Youssif, Khayrya A.",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34356745/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10070824,550

Routes of transmission remain to be fully understood. METHODS: This prospective study compared a 1,500-bed adult and a 600-bed pediatric setting of a tertiary-care university hospital located in central Paris. From February 24(th) until April 10(th), 2020, all symptomatic HCW were screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) on a nasopharyngeal swab. HCW screened positive were questioned on their profession, symptoms, occupational and non-occupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Among 1344 HCW tested, 373 were positive (28%) and 336 (90%) corresponding questionnaires were completed. Three hospitalizations and no death were reported. Most HCW (70%) had patient-facing occupational activities (22% in COVID-19 dedicated units). The total number of HCW cases peaked on March 23(rd), then decreased slowly, concomitantly with a continuous increase of compliance to preventive measures (including universal medical masking and personal protective equipment (PPE) for direct care to COVID-19 patients). Attack rates were of 3.2% and 2.3% in the adult and pediatric setting, respectively (p=0.0022). In the adult setting, HCW more frequently reported exposure to COVID-19 patients without PPE (25% versus 15%, p=0.046). Report of contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities dramatically decreased over the study period. CONCLUSION: Universal masking, reinforcement of hand hygiene, and PPE with medical masks for patients’ care allowed protection of HCW and containment of the outbreak. Residual transmissions were related to persistent exposures with undiagnosed patients or colleagues and not to contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities.","Contejean, Adrien; Leporrier, Jérémie; Canouï, Etienne; Alby-Laurent, Fanny; Lafont, Emmanuel; Beaudeau, Lauren; Parize, Perrine; Lecieux, Fabienne; Greffet, Agnès; Chéron, Gérard; Gauzit, Rémy; Fourgeaud, Jacques; L’Honneur, Anne-Sophie; Tréluyer, Jean-Marc; Charlier, Caroline; Casetta, Anne; Frange, Pierre; Leruez-Ville, Marianne; Rozenberg, Flore; Lortholary, Olivier; Kernéis, Solen",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32663849/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa977,550
620575,The mediating role of perceived social support between anxiety symptoms and life satisfaction in pregnant women: a cross-sectional study,2020-07-10,"In atherosclerosis patients, vascular endothelial dysfunction is commonly observed alongside damage of the vascular endothelial glycocalyx, an extracellular matrix bound to and encapsulating the endothelial cells lining the blood vessel wall. Although atherosclerotic risk factors have been reported in severe patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the exact mechanisms are unclear. The mortality associated with the COVID-19 outbreak is increased by comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cardiovascular disease. Besides, older individuals and smokers have significantly worse outcomes. Interestingly, these comorbidities and risk factors are consistent with the pathophysiology that causes vascular endothelial glycocalyx damage. Moreover, vascular glycocalyx dysfunction causes microvascular leakage, which results in interstitial pulmonary abnormal shadows (multiple patchy shadows with a ground glass inter-pneumonic appearance). This is frequently followed by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), closely related to coagulo-fibrinolytic changes contributing to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, as well as inducing activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to thromboembolism and multiple organ failure. Notably, SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19, binds to ACE2, which is abundantly present not only in human epithelia of the lung and the small intestine, but also in vascular endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells. Moreover, COVID-19 can induce severe septic shock, and sepsis can easily lead to systemic degradation of the vascular endothelial glycocalyx. In the current review, we propose new concepts and therapeutic goals for COVID-19-related vascular endothelial glycocalyx damage, based on previous vascular endothelial medicine research.","Yamaoka-Tojo, Minako",Biomed J,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2319417020301414?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2319417020301414; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bj.2020.08.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33032965/,550
620666,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward COVID-19 among university students in Japan and associated factors: An online cross-sectional survey",2020-12-21,"STUDY QUESTION: What is the optimal follicular tracking strategy for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) in order to minimise face-to-face interactions? SUMMARY ANSWER: As data from follicular tracking scans on Days 5, 6 or 7 of stimulation are the most useful to accurately predict trigger timing and risk of over-response, scans on these days should be prioritised if streamlined monitoring is necessary. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: British Fertility Society guidance for centres restarting ART following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-related shutdowns recommends reducing the number of patient visits for monitoring during COS. Current evidence on optimal monitoring during ovarian stimulation is sparse, and protocols vary significantly. Small studies of simplifying IVF therapy by minimising monitoring have reported no adverse effects on outcomes, including live birth rate. There are opportunities to learn from the adaptations necessary during these extraordinary times to improve the efficiency of IVF care in the longer term. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective database analysis of 9294 ultrasound scans performed during monitoring of 2322 IVF cycles undertaken by 1875 women in a single centre was performed. The primary objective was to identify when in the IVF cycle the data obtained from ultrasound are most predictive of both oocyte maturation trigger timing and an over-response to stimulation. If a reduced frequency of clinic visits is needed due to COVID-19 precautions, prioritising attendance for monitoring scans on the most predictive cycle days may be prudent. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The study comprised anonymised retrospective database analysis of IVF/ICSI cycles at a tertiary referral IVF centre. Machine learning models are used in combining demographic and follicular tracking data to predict cycle oocyte maturation trigger timing and over-response. The primary outcome was the day or days in cycle from which scan data yield optimal model prediction performance statistics. The model for predicting trigger day uses patient age, number of follicles at baseline scan and follicle count by size for the current scan. The model to predict over-response uses age and number of follicles of a given size. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The earliest cycle day for which our model has high accuracy to predict both trigger day and risk of over-response is stimulation Day 5. The Day 5 model to predict trigger date has a mean squared error 2.16 ± 0.12 and to predict over-response an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.91 ± 0.01. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is a retrospective single-centre study and the results may not be generalisable to centres using different treatment protocols. The results are derived from modelling, and further clinical validation studies will verify the accuracy of the model. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Follicular tracking starting at Day 5 of stimulation may help to streamline the amount of monitoring required in COS. Previous small studies have shown that minimal monitoring protocols did not adversely impact outcomes. If IVF can safely be made less onerous on the clinic’s resources and patient’s time, without compromising success, this could help to reduce burden-related treatment drop-out.

621063,COVID-19 and endoscopic management of superficial gastrointestinal neoplastic lesions: a multinational cross-sectional survey,2020-08-11,"GenBank contains over 3 million viral sequences. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) previously made available a tool for validating and annotating influenza virus sequences that is used to check submissions to GenBank. Before this project, there was no analogous tool in use for non-influenza viral sequence submissions. We developed a system called VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) that validates and annotates viral sequences in GenBank submissions. The annotation system is based on the analysis of the input nucleotide sequence using models built from curated RefSeqs. Hidden Markov models are used to classify sequences by determining the RefSeq they are most similar to, and feature annotation from the RefSeq is mapped based on a nucleotide alignment of the full sequence to a covariance model. Predicted proteins encoded by the sequence are validated with nucleotide-to-protein alignments using BLAST. The system identifies 43 types of “alerts” that (unlike the previous BLAST-based system) provide deterministic and rigorous feedback to researchers who submit sequences with unexpected characteristics. VADR has been integrated into GenBank’s submission processing pipeline allowing for viral submissions passing all tests to be accepted and annotated automatically, without the need for any human (GenBank indexer) intervention. Unlike the previous submission-checking system, VADR is freely available (https://github.com/nawrockie/vadr) for local installation and use. VADR has been used for Norovirus submissions since May 2018 and for Dengue virus submissions since January 2019. Other viruses with high numbers of submissions will be added incrementally. VADR improves the speed with which non-flu virus submissions to GenBank can be checked and improves the content and quality of the GenBank annotations. The availability and portability of the software allow researchers to run the GenBank checks prior to submitting their viral sequences, and thereby gain confidence that their submissions will be accepted immediately without the need to correspond with GenBank staff. Reciprocally, the adoption of VADR frees GenBank staff to spend more time on services other than checking routine viral sequence submissions.","Schäffer, Alejandro A; Hatcher, Eneida L; Yankie, Linda; Shonkwiler, Lara; Brister, J Rodney; Karsch-Mizrachi, Ilene; Nawrocki, Eric P",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/852657,550

Potential target populations were distinguished based on perceived need for mental health treatment and psychological distress, assessed by the Kessler-6, among those without perceived need. Populations were characterized with respect to demographic characteristics and prior mental health treatment history using logistic regression models.Results: The prevalence of perceived need for mental health treatment was 21%. Perceived need was strongly associated with pre-pandemic treatment history; compared to those with no treatment history, perceived need was dramatically higher among those in treatment when the pandemic began (OR = 53.8 95% CI 28.2-102.8) and those with pre-pandemic treatment history (OR = 9.3, 95% CI 5.1-16.8). Among the 79% who did not perceive need, moderate or greater distress was reported by 19% and was associated with younger age and Hispanic ethnicity (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.6).Conclusions: In the U.S., where mental health treatment is relatively common, mental health treatment response during the pandemic, and perhaps other crises, should target people with a history of mental health treatment. Outreach to people less likely to seek care on their own despite clinically significant distress should target Hispanic populations.","Breslau, Joshua; North, Carol S; Finucane, Melissa L; Roth, Elizabeth; Collins, Rebecca L",Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1080/00332747.2021.1940470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34328393/,550

As a result, the subunits present distinct conformations of the binding pocket. By analyzing this long simulation, we uncover a previously unrecognized role of water molecules in triggering the transition. Interestingly, each subunit presents a different collection of long-lived water molecules. Enhanced sampling simulations performed here, along with machine learning approaches, further establish that the transition to the asymmetric state is essentially irreversible.","Ansari, Narjes; Rizzi, Valerio; Carloni, Paolo; Parrinello, Michele",J Am Chem Soc,https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c05301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34398611/,550

STUDY DESIGN: An online cross-sectional study was conducted among a representative sample of the French population between November 20th and 23rd 2020 (N = 1146). METHODS: Factors associated with the intention to get vaccinated and with COVID-19 vaccine attitudes were estimated using ordered logistic and multinomial logistic regressions, respectively. Independent variables of interest include COVID-19 and vaccine perceptions, trust, endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories and time/risk preferences. RESULTS: Only 30.5% of our respondents would agree to get vaccinated against COVID-19 during the first semester of 2021 while 31.1% declare being unsure of their vaccination intentions. COVID-19 risk perceptions are associated with vaccination intentions and attitudes. Individual and collective benefits of the vaccine and the concerns over its safety are strongly associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions and attitudes. Vaccine acceptors are more willing to take risks in the health domain compared with vaccine hesitant respondents which indicates that the COVID-19 vaccine is perceived as a greater health risk than the COVID-19 itself by some respondents. We also find a positive association between future preference and the willingness to get vaccinated. CONCLUSION: Awareness campaigns should be conducted to enhance vaccination uptake among vaccine hesitant individuals. These campaigns could highlight the positive benefit-risk balance of the COVID-19 vaccines or the short-term benefits of vaccination and should reinsure the public on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines.","Guillon, M.; Kergall, P.",Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S003335062100305X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003335062100305X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34481275/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.07.035,550

Conclusion An FTA could cause price increases of medicines and medical devices, and cause some disruption to the ability of regulating authorities in this area, while a no-deal would additionally risk shortages of medicines and medical devices as well as more dramatic price increases. In both an FTA and a 'no-deal scenario', with EU law no longer applicable to the UK, more innovative policy in the area of tobacco control could be developed. An FTA could exacerbate existing workforce shortages and would likely cause a reduction in EU research funding, as well as posing issues with data transfers, with these all likely to be more severe under a no-deal scenario.","Coughlan, James; Shah, Sam",Br Dent J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33188346/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41415-020-2278-z,550

Rather than looking for drugs that directly interact with key viral proteins inhibiting its replication, an alternative and possibly add‐on approach is to dismantle the host cell machinery that enables the virus to infect the host cell and spread from one cell to another. Excellent examples of such machinery are host cell proteases whose role in viral pathogenesis has been demonstrated in numerous coronaviruses. In this review, we propose two therapeutic modalities to tackle SARS‐CoV‐2 infections; the first is to transcriptionally modulate the expression of cellular proteases and their endogenous inhibitors and the second is to directly inhibit their enzymatic activity. We present a nonexhaustive collection of clinically investigated drugs that act by one of these mechanisms and thus represent promising candidates for preclinical in vitro testing and hopefully clinical testing in COVID‐19 patients.","El‐Shimy, Ismail A.; Mohamed, Mahmoud M.

Understanding the genes that control tolerance and resistance could provide new strategies to improve the health and welfare of livestock. Around one sixth of the world cattle population is estimated to be at risk from one of the most debilitating tick-borne diseases of cattle, caused by the protozoan parasite, Theileria annulata. The parasite mainly infects cells of the myeloid lineage which are also the main producers of inflammatory cytokines. If an infectious or inflammatory insult is sufficiently great, inflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages enter the circulation and induce an acute phase proteins (APP) response. The Bos taurus Holstein breed produces higher and more prolonged levels of inflammatory cytokine induced APP than the Bos indicus Sahiwal breed in response to experimental infection with T. annulata. The Sahiwal exhibits significantly less pathology and survives infection, unlike the Holstein breed. Therefore, we hypothesised that the causal genes were likely to be expressed in macrophages and control the production of inflammatory cytokines. A functional genomics approach revealed that the transcriptome profile of the B. taurus macrophages was more associated with an inflammatory programme than the B. indicus macrophages. In particular the most differentially expressed gene was a member of the signal regulatory protein (SIRP) family. These are mainly expressed on myeloid cell surfaces and control inflammatory responses. Other differentially expressed genes included bovine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (BoLA) class II genes, particularly BoLA DQ, and transforming growth factor (TGF)B2. We are now exploring whether sequence and functional differences in the bovine SIRP family may underlie the resistance or tolerance to T. annulata between the breeds. Potentially, our research may also have more general implications for the control of inflammatory processes against other pathogens. Genes controlling the balance between pathology and protection may determine how livestock can survive in the face of infectious onslaught. Next generation sequencing and RNAi methodologies for livestock species will bring new opportunities to link diversity at the genome level to functional differences in health traits in livestock species.","Glass, Elizabeth J.; Crutchley, Sarah; Jensen, Kirsty",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22482839/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.03.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242712000797; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242712000797,550

Institutes of Higher Education are heterogeneous work units that supported continued in person employment during COVID-19, providing an excellent test site for occupational health evaluation. Objective: To evaluate self-reported behaviors and SARS-CoV-2 among essential in-person employees during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Cross-sectional, conducted from July 13- September 2, 2020. Setting: Institute of Higher Education in Fort Collins, Colorado. Participants: Employees identified to be an essential in-person employee during the first six months of the pandemic (1,522 invited, 1,507 qualified, 603 (40%) completed the survey). Of those completing the survey, 84.2% (508) elected to participate in blood and nasal swab sample collection to assess active SARS-CoV-2 infection via qRT-PCR, and past infection by serology (overall completion rate of 33.7%). Eligibility included > 18 years old, able to read and understand English, not currently experiencing cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever >100.4F (38C), chills/shaking with chills, muscle pain, new or worsening headaches, sore throat or new loss of sense of taste/smell. Exposure: Self-reported COVID-19 protective behaviors Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Current SARS-CoV-2 infection detected by qRT-PCR or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection detected by IgG SARS-CoV-2 testing platform. Results: There were no qRT-PCR positive tests, and only 2 (0.39%) contained seroreactive IgG antibodies. Participants were 60% female, 90% non-Hispanic white, mean age 41 years (18-70 years). Handwashing and mask wearing were reported frequently both at work (98% and 94% respectively) and outside work (91% and 95% respectively) while social distancing was reported less frequently at work (79%) then outside of work (92%) [p < .001]. Participants were more highly motivated to avoid exposures out of concern for spreading to others (83%) than for personal implications (63%) [ p < .001].

629060,Early perceptions and behavioural responses during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey of UK adults,2021-01-04,"BACKGROUND: The current COVID‐19 pandemic, caused by SARS‐CoV‐2, has emerged as a public health emergency. All nations are seriously challenged as the virus spreads rapidly across the globe with no regard for borders. The primary management of IBD involves treating uncontrolled inflammation with most patients requiring immune‐based therapies. However, these therapies may weaken the immune system and potentially place IBD patients at increased risk of infections and infectious complications including those from COVID‐19. AIM: To summarise the scale of the COVID‐19 pandemic, review unique concerns regarding IBD management and infection risk during the pandemic and assess COVID‐19 management options and drug interactions in the IBD population. METHODS: A literature review on IBD, SARS‐CoV‐2 and COVID‐19 was undertaken and relevant literature was summarised and critically examined. RESULTS: IBD patients do not appear to be more susceptible to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and there is no evidence of an association between IBD therapies and increased risk of COVID‐19. IBD medication adherence should be encouraged to prevent disease flare but where possible high‐dose systemic corticosteroids should be avoided. Patients should exercise social distancing, optimise co‐morbidities and be up to date with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. If a patient develops COVID‐19, immune suppressing medications should be withheld until infection resolution and if trial medications for COVID‐19 are being considered, potential drug interactions should be checked. CONCLUSION: IBD patient management presents a challenge in the current COVID‐19 pandemic. The primary focus should remain on keeping bowel inflammation controlled and encouraging medication adherence.","Al‐Ani, Aysha H.; Prentice, Ralley E.; Rentsch, Clarissa A.; Johnson, Doug; Ardalan, Zaid; Heerasing, Neel; Garg, Mayur; Campbell, Sian; Sasadeusz, Joe; Macrae, Finlay A.; Ng, Siew C.; Rubin, David T.; Christensen, Britt",Aliment Pharmacol Ther,https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.15779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32348598/,550

The task of vaccinating some 20 million people within this timeframe presents considerable logistical challenges. Key to meeting this target is the rate of vaccine delivery: the number of vaccine doses that can be administered per day. In the opening phase, high priority groups will receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine through hospital hubs at an initial rate of 80,000 doses per week. However, pending regulatory approval, the currently announced plan appears to be to distribute the AstraZeneca vaccine to the bulk of the popluation through a combination of general practices and community pharmacies. Here, we run a series of projections to estimate how long it will take to vaccinate the Australian population under different assumptions about the rate of vaccine administration as well as the schedule for second doses and prevalence of vaccine hesitancy. Our analysis highlights the ambitious rate of vaccine administration that will be neccessary to meet the Australian Government completion target of October 2021. A rate of 200,000 doses per day would comfortably meet that target; 80,000 doses a day would see roll-out extended until mid-2022. Speed is of the essence when it comes to vaccine rollout: protecting the population quickly will minimise the risk of sporadic and costly lockdowns lockdowns and the potential for small, local clusters getting out of control and sparking new epidemic waves. The government should gather all its resources to maximise the daily vaccination rate, ideally aiming to ramp up administration to at least 200,000 doses per day as quickly as possible. Quickly achieving and maintaining this pace will likely require dedicated large-scale vaccination sites that are capable of delivering thousands of doses a week in addition to the enthusiastic participation of GP practices and community pharmacies around the country. Lessons on the neccessary logistical planning, including coordination of delivery, ultra-cold-chain storage and staffing, can potentially be learned from Israel, where between 7,000 and 20,000 vaccinations per million population have been delivered daily throughout January.","Hanly, M.

631710,"Prevalence of Anxiety and Depression symptom, and the Demands for Psychological Knowledge and Interventions in college students during COVID-19 epidemic: A large Cross-Sectional Study",2020-07-02,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pneumonia present with typical findings on chest computed tomography (CT), but the underlying histopathological patterns are unknown. Through direct regional correlation of imaging findings to histopathological patterns, this study aimed to explain typical COVID‐19 CT patterns at tissue level. METHODS: Eight autopsy cases were prospectively selected of patients with PCR‐proven COVID‐19 pneumonia with varying clinical manifestations and causes of death. All had been subjected to chest CT imaging 24–72 h prior to death. Twenty‐seven lung areas with typical COVID‐19 patterns and two radiologically unaffected pulmonary areas were correlated to histopathological findings in the same lung regions. RESULTS: Two dominant radiological patterns were observed: ground‐glass opacity (GGO) (n = 11) and consolidation (n = 16). In seven of 11 sampled areas of GGO, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was observed. In four areas of GGO, the histological pattern was vascular damage and thrombosis, with (n = 2) or without DAD (n = 2). DAD was also observed in five of 16 samples derived from areas of radiological consolidation. Seven areas of consolidation were based on a combination of DAD, vascular damage and thrombosis. In four areas of consolidation, bronchopneumonia was found. Unexpectedly, in samples from radiologically unaffected lung parenchyma, evidence was found of vascular damage and thrombosis. CONCLUSION: In COVID‐19, radiological findings of GGO and consolidation are mostly explained by DAD or a combination of DAD and vascular damage plus thrombosis. However, the different typical CT patterns in COVID‐19 are not related to specific histopathological patterns. Microvascular damage and thrombosis are even encountered in the radiologically normal lung.","Kianzad, Azar; Meijboom, Lilian J.; Nossent, Esther J.; Roos, Eva; Schurink, Bernadette; Bonta, Peter I.; van den Berk, Inge A.

Recent studies have tried to evaluate CHA2DS2-VASc score on admission in COVID-19 patients to predict mortality. Methods: We conducted a literature search on 14 April 2021 to retrieve all published studies, pre-prints and grey literature related to the predictive power of CHA2DS2-VASc score in COVID-19 patients of admission and mortality. Screening of studies and data extraction was done by two authors independently. We used the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool for the methodological quality assessment of the included studies. Results: Five studies involving 5,941 patients reported the predictive value of CHA2DS2-VASc score for mortality in COVID-19 patients. The pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and area under curve were 0.72 (95% CI 0.63-0.79), 0.74 (95% CI 0.67-0.81) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.76-0.83). Conclusions: CHA2DS2-VASc score at admission has good predictive value for mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection and can help clinicians identify potentially severe cases early.

The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) established active, statewide surveillance to describe hospitalized patients with the syndrome. METHODS: Hospitals in New York State reported cases of Kawasaki’s disease, toxic shock syndrome, myocarditis, and potential MIS-C in hospitalized patients younger than 21 years of age and sent medical records to the NYSDOH. We carried out descriptive analyses that summarized the clinical presentation, complications, and outcomes of patients who met the NYSDOH case definition for MIS-C between March 1 and May 10, 2020. RESULTS: As of May 10, 2020, a total of 191 potential cases were reported to the NYSDOH. Of 95 patients with confirmed MIS-C (laboratory-confirmed acute or recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection) and 4 with suspected MIS-C (met clinical and epidemiologic criteria), 53 (54%) were male; 31 of 78 (40%) were black, and 31 of 85 (36%) were Hispanic. A total of 31 patients (31%) were 0 to 5 years of age, 42 (42%) were 6 to 12 years of age, and 26 (26%) were 13 to 20 years of age.

635268,Caring for anxiety among adults in the face of COVID-19: A cross-sectional online survey,2020-10-09,"INTRODUCTION: Staphylococcus aureus strains, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), are a main cause of nosocomial infection in the world. The majority of nosocomial S. aureus-infection are traced back to a source of contaminated surfaces including surgery tables. We assessed the efficacy of a mixture of levulinic acid (LA) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), hereafter called MoWa, to eradicate nosocomial pathogens from contaminated surfaces. METHODS AND RESULTS: A dose response study demonstrated that MoWa killed 24 h planktonic cultures of S. aureus strains starting at a concentration of (LA) 8.2/(SDS) 0.3 mM while 24 h preformed biofilms were eradicated with 32/1.3 mM. A time course study further showed that attached MRSA bacteria were eradicated within 4 h of incubation with 65/2 mM MoWa. Staphylococci were killed as confirmed by bacterial counts, and fluorescence micrographs that were stained with the live/dead bacterial assay. We then simulated contamination of hospital surfaces by inoculating bacteria on a surface prone to contamination. Once dried, contaminated surfaces were sprayed with MoWa or mock-treated, and treated contaminated surfaces were swabbed and bacteria counted. While bacteria in the mock-treated samples grew at a density of ~10(4) cfu/cm(2), those treated for ~1 min with MoWa (1.0/0.04 M) had been eradicated below limit of detection. A similar eradication efficacy was obtained when surfaces were contaminated with other nosocomial pathogens, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS: MoWa kills planktonic and biofilms made by MRSA and MSSA strains and showed great efficacy to disinfect MRSA-, and MSSA-contaminated, surfaces and surfaces contaminated with other important nosocomial pathogens.","Gregory, Tyler V.; Ellis, Karen; Valeriani, Renzo; Khan, Faidad; Wu, Xueqing; Murin, Landon; Alibayov, Babek; Vidal, Ana G.

Among immune cells, T lymphocytes pdomote cellular and humoral responses as well as innate immunity. Therefore, careful investigation of these cells has a significant impact on accurate knowledge in COVID-19 disease pathogenesis. In current research, the frequency and function of various T lymphocytes involved in immune responses examined in SARS‐CoV-2 patients with various disease severity compared to normal subjects. In order to make an accurate comparison among patients with various disease severity, this study was performed on asymptomatic recovered cases (n = 20), ICU hospitalized patients (n = 30), non-ICU hospitalized patients (n = 30), and normal subjects (n = 20). To precisely evaluate T cells activity following purification, their cytokine secretion activity was examined. Similarly, immediately after purification of Treg cells, their inhibitory activity on T cells was investigated. The results showed that COVID-19 patients with severe disease (ICU hospitalized patients) not only had a remarkable increase in Th1 and Th17 but also a considerable decrease in Th2 and Treg cells. More importantly, as the IL-17 and IFN-γ secretion was sharply increased in severe disease, the secretion of IL-10 and IL-4 was decreased. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of Treg cells was reduced in severe disease patients in comparison to other groups. In severe COVID-19 disease, current findings indicate when the inflammatory arm of cellular immunity is significantly increased, a considerable reduction in anti-inflammatory and regulatory arm occurred.","Mahmoud Salehi Khesht, Armin; Karpisheh, Vahid; Qubais Saeed, Balsam; Olegovna Zekiy, Angelina; Yapanto, Lis M.; Nabi Afjadi, Mohsen; Aksoun, Mohsen; Nasr Esfahani, Maryam; Aghakhani, Fatemeh; Movahed, Mahsa; Joshi, Navneet; Abbaszadeh-Goudarzi, Kazem; Hallaj, Shahin; Ahmadi, Majid; Dolati, Sanam; Mahmoodpoor, Ata; Hashemi, Vida; Jadidi-Niaragh, Farhad",Int Immunopharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34091116/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576921004641?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576921004641; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107828,550

A total of 185 WWTPs inflow samples were collected over the period consisting of both the first wave (mid-March to June) and the second wave (July to November). Concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (N1 and N2 assays) were quantified in these wastewaters as well as those of Human adenoviruses (HAdV) and JC polyomavirus (JCPyV), as indicators of human faecal contamination. SARS-CoV-2 N gene daily loads strongly correlated with the number of cases diagnosed one week after sampling i.e. wastewater levels were a good predictor of cases to be diagnosed in the immediate future. The conditions present at small WWTPs relative to larger WWTPs influence the ability to follow the pandemic. Small WWTPs (<24,000 inhabitants) had lower median loads of SARS-CoV-2 despite similar incidence of infection within the municipalities served by the different WWTP (but not lower loads of HAdV and JCPyV). The lowest incidence resulting in quantifiable SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater differed between WWTP sizes, being 0.11 and 0.82 cases/1000 inhabitants for the large and small sized WWTP respectively.","Rusiñol, M.; Zammit, I.; Itarte, M.; Forés, E.; Martínez-Puchol, S.; Girones, R.; Borrego, C.; Corominas, Ll.; Bofill-Mas, S.",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721025341?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721025341; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33989864/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147463,550

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this paper is to propose a PPE calculation system to help hospitals to decide their PPE stockpile. METHODS: We searched influenza guidelines from a number of countries and research papers on protective devices and infectious diseases. The PPE calculation system included factors such as the influenza pandemic period, risk classification by health care workers (HCW) type, and the type and number of PPE for a HCW per day. RESULTS: We concluded that 4 sets of PPE (N95 respirators, double gloves, gowns, and goggles) per day should be prepared for HCWs in a high-risk group. Similarly, 2 sets of appropriate PPE, depending on the risk level, are required for medium- and low-risk groups. In addition, 2 surgical masks are required for every worker and inpatient and 1 for each outpatient. The PPE stockpile should be prepared to cover at least an 8-week pandemic.

Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits marked tropism for cells that harbor the membrane-bound metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) at their plasmalemma, predominantly in cells lining the oral cavity, upper respiratory tract, and bronchoalveolar cells, making these epithelial mucosae the most likely viral receptor cell targets and entry routes. Secondly, the crystal structures of several coronavirus spike proteins in complex with their cell host target receptors, and of SARS-Cov-2 in complex with an inhibitor, are now available at atomic resolution through X-ray diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy studies. Thirdly, viral entry of other viruses has been successfully blocked by inhibiting viral endogenous proteases or clathrin/dynamin-dependent endocytosis, the same internalization pathway followed by ACE2 and some viruses. Fourthly, the target cell-surface receptor molecules and SARS-CoV-2 possess other putative sites for drugs potentially modulating receptor activity or virus processing. A multi-pronged pharmacological approach attacking more than one flank of the viral-receptor interactions is worth considering as a front-line strategy.","Barrantes, Francisco J.",Front Physiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719619/,550
640837,Understanding Physicians’ Preferences for Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Study,2021-08-13,"BACKGROUND: Health optimisation programmes are an increasingly popular policy intervention that aim to support patients to lose weight or stop smoking ahead of surgery. There is little evidence about their impact and the experience of their use. The aim of this study was to investigate the experiences and perspectives of commissioners, clinicians and patients involved in a locality’s health optimisation programme in the United Kingdom. The programme alters access to elective orthopaedic surgery for patients who smoke or are obese (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2)), diverting them to a 12-week programme of behavioural change interventions prior to assessment for surgical referral. METHODS: A thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews (n = 20) with National Health Service and Local Authority commissioners and planners, healthcare professionals, and patients using the pathway. RESULTS: Health optimisation was broadly acceptable to professionals and patients in our sample and offered a chance to trigger both short term pre-surgical weight loss/smoking cessation and longer-term sustained changes to lifestyle intentions post-surgery. Communicating the nature and purpose of the programme to patients was challenging and consequently the quality of the explanation received and understanding gained by patients was generally low. Insight into the successful implementation of health optimisation for the hip and knee pathway, but failure in roll-out to other surgical specialities, suggests placement of health optimisation interventions into the ‘usual waiting time’ for surgical referral may be of greatest acceptability to professionals and patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and professionals supported the continuation of health optimisation in this context and recognised likely health and wellbeing benefits for a majority of patients. However, the clinicians’ communication to patients about health optimisation needs to improve to prepare patients and optimise their engagement.","McLaughlin, Joanna; Palmer, Cecily; Redwood, Sabi; Kipping, Ruth; Owens, Lucie; Reynolds, Rebecca; Scott, Lauren J; Hill, Elizabeth M; Donovan, Jenny L; Jago, Russell; Owen-Smith, Amanda",BMC Health Serv Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06434-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33933095/,550

However, the downstream effects regarding susceptibilities to secondary infection risk remains unknown. This study seeks to determine risk differences for secondary infections among COVID-19 patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. METHODS: We conducted a matched retrospective cohort study from two large, acute care hospitals in Western Connecticut from March 1, to May 31, 2020. We collected variables using manual medical record abstraction. The primary exposure variable was any dose of tocilizumab. The primary outcome was any healthcare-associated bacterial or fungal infection as defined by the National Healthcare Safety Network. We performed a Kaplan–Meier analysis to assess the crude difference in cumulative probability of healthcare-associated infection (HAI) across exposure groups. We also performed a multivariable Cox regression analysis to determine the hazard ratio for HAI by exposure group while controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: The Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated no difference in the cumulative probability of HAI across groups. The adjusted hazard of HAI for patients given tocilizumab was 0.85 times that of patients not given tocilizumab (95% confidence interval = 0.29, 2.52, P = 0.780) after controlling for relevant confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab did not increase the incidence of secondary infection among COVID-19 patients. Larger, randomized trials should evaluate infection as a secondary outcome to validate this finding.","Moore, Joanna L.; Stroever, Stephanie J.; Rondain, Patricia E.; Scatena, Robyn N.",J Glob Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34194172/; https://doi.org/10.4103/jgid.jgid_358_20,550

Due to a lack of reliable disposal pathways, acid whey currently presents a major sustainability challenge to the dairy industry. The study presented in this paper proposes a solution to this issue by transforming yogurt acid whey (YAW) into potentially palatable and marketable beverages through yeast fermentation. In this study, five prototypes were developed and fermented by Kluyveromyces marxianus, Brettanomyces bruxellensis, Brettanomyces claussenii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain: Hornindal kveik), and IOC Be Fruits (IOCBF) S. cerevisiae, respectively. Their fermentation profiles were characterized by changes in density, pH, cell count, and concentrations of ethanol and organic acids. The prototypes were also evaluated on 26 sensory attributes, which were generated through a training session with 14 participants. While S. cerevisiae (IOCBF) underwent the fastest fermentation (8 days) and B. claussenii the slowest (21 days), K. marxianus and S. cerevisiae (Hornindal kveik) showed similar fermentation rates, finishing on day 20. The change in pH of the fermentate was similar for all five strains (from around 4.45 to between 4.25 and 4.31). Cell counts remained stable throughout the fermentation for all five strains (at around 6 log colony-forming units (CFU)/mL) except in the case of S. cerevisiae (Hornindal kveik), which ultimately decreased by 1.63 log CFU/mL. B. bruxellensis was the only strain unable to utilize all of the sugars in the substrate, with residual galactose remaining after fermentation. While both S. cerevisiae (IOCBF)- and B. claussenii-fermented samples were characterized by a fruity apple aroma, the former also had an aroma characteristic of lactic acid, dairy products, bakeries and yeast. A chemical odor characteristic of petroleum, gasoline or solvents, was perceived in samples fermented by B. bruxellensis and K. marxianus. An aroma of poorly aged or rancid cheese or milk also resulted from B. bruxellensis fermentation. In terms of appearance and mouthfeel, the S. cerevisiae (IOCBF)-fermented sample was rated the cloudiest, with the heaviest body. This study provides a toolkit for product development in a potential dairy-based category of fermented alcoholic beverages, which can increase revenue for the dairy industry by upcycling the common waste product YAW.","Luo, Siyi (Rossie); DeMarsh, Timothy A.; deRiancho, Dana; Stelick, Alina; Alcaine, Samuel D.",Foods,https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10061204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071759/,550

AIM: To reveal more data on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan, in Zhejiang, China. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: 88 cases of laboratory-confirmed and 3 cases of clinical-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to five hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. Data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 11 February 2020. RESULTS: Of all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 while 3 (3.30%) were clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 cases. The median age of the patients was 50 (36.5-57) years, and female accounted for 59.34%. In this sample 40 (43.96%) patients had contracted the diseases from local cases, 31 (34.07%) patients had been to Wuhan/Hubei, 8 (8.79%) cases had contacted with people from Wuhan, 11 (12.09%) cases were confirmed aircraft transmission. In particular within the city of Ningbo, 60.52% cases can be traced back to an event held in a temple. The most common symptoms were fever (71.43%), cough (60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%).

However, regulatory systems are inevitably political because their purpose is to decide whether the use of particular products will help or hinder the delivery of public policy objectives. ENGOs are most able to interfere in regulatory decision-making when policy objectives and decision-making criteria are vague, making the process vulnerable to disruption by organisations that have a distinct agenda. Making regulatory decision-making about GM crops and other green biotechnology more resistant to interference therefore requires better politics not the removal of politics. Better politics begins with political leadership making a case for green biotechnology in achieving food security and other sustainable development goals. Such a policy must involve making political choices and cannot be outsourced to science. Other aspects of better politics include regulatory reform to set policy aims and decision-making criteria that encourage innovation as well as control risk, and engagement with civil society that discusses the values behind attitudes to the application of green biotechnology. In short, green biotechnology for sustainable development needs better politics to counter well-organised opposition, to encourage innovation, and to build the trust of civil society for these policies. Removing politics from regulatory governance would be a gift to ENGOs that are opposed to the use of biotechnology.","Raybould, Alan",Transgenic Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11248-021-00277-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34351560/,550

COVID19 disease severity is correlated with heightened inflammatory responses, and HMGB1 is an important extracellular mediator in inflammation processes.In this study, we evaluated the effect of HMGB1 inhibitor Glycyrrhizin on the cellular perturbations in lung cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. Pyroptosis in lung cells transfected with SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD- and Orf3a, was accompanied by elevation of extracellular HMGB1 and IL-1β levels. Glycyrrhizin mitigated viral proteins- induced lung cell pyroptosis and activation of macrophages. Heightened release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 as well as ferritin from macrophages, cultured in conditioned media from lung cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and Orf3a was attenuated by glycyrrhizin. Importantly, Glycyrrhizin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells without exhibiting cytotoxicity at high doses. The dual ability of Glycyrrhizin to concomitantly halt virus replication and dampen pro-inflammatory mediators might constitute a viable therapeutic option in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gowda, Pruthvi; Patrick, Shruti; Dutt Joshi, Shankar; Kumar Kumawat, Rajesh; Sen, Ellora",Cytokine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466621000764; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466621000764?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33773396/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2021.155496,550

Considering the uneven spatial distribution of those severe outcomes at the municipality level, the objective of this study was, first, to identify high-risk areas for COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths, and second, to determine the associated contextual factors with the uneven spatial distribution of both study outcomes in Sweden. METHODS: The existences of spatial autocorrelation of the standardised incidence (hospitalisations) ratio and standardised mortality ratio were investigated using Global Moran’s I test. Furthermore, we applied the retrospective Poisson spatial scan statistics to identify high-risk spatial clusters. The association between the contextual demographic and socioeconomic factors and the number of hospitalisations and deaths was estimated using a quasi-Poisson generalised additive regression model. RESULTS: Ten high-risk spatial clusters of hospitalisations and six high-risk clusters of mortality were identified in Sweden from February 2020 to October 2020. The hospitalisations and deaths were associated with three contextual variables in a multivariate model: population density (inhabitants/km(2)) and the proportion of immigrants (%) showed a positive association with both outcomes, while the proportion of the population aged 65+ years (%) showed a negative association. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified high-risk spatial clusters for hospitalisations and deaths due to COVID-19 and the association of population density, the proportion of immigrants and the proportion of people aged 65+ years with those severe outcomes.

Comment on “Telemedicine in Germany During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Multi-Professional National Survey”,2021-02-17,"Gastrointestinal bacteria that harbor antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) become enriched with antibiotic use. Livestock manure application to cropland for soil fertility presents a concern that ARG and bacteria may proliferate and be transported in the environment. In the United States, manure applications typically occur during autumn with slow mineralization until spring planting season. A laboratory soil incubation study was conducted mimicking autumn swine manure application to soils with concentrations of selected ARG monitored during simulated 120-day winter incubation with multiple freeze-thaw events. Additionally, the effects of two soil moistures [10 and 30% water holding capacity (WHC)] and two manure treatments [raw versus hydrated lime alkaline stabilization (HLAS)] were assessed. Fourteen tetracycline resistance genes were evaluated; tet(D), tet(G), and tet(L) were detected in background soil while swine manure contained tet(A), tet(B), tet(C), tet(G), tet(M), tet(O), tet(Q), and tet(X). By day 120, the manure-borne tet(M) and tet(O) were still detected while tet(C), tet(D), tet(L), and tet(X) genes were detected less frequently. Other tet resistance genes were detected rarely, if at all. The sum of unique tet resistance genes among all treatments decreased during the incubation from an average of 8.9 to 3.8 unique tet resistance genes. Four resistance elements, intI1, bla(ctx–m–32), sul(I), erm(B), and 16s rRNA genes were measured using quantitative PCR. ARG abundances relative to 16S abundance were initially greater in the raw manure compared to background soil (−1.53 to −3.92 log abundance in manure; −4.02 to <−6.7 log abundance in soil). In the mixed manure/soil, relative abundance of the four resistance elements decreased (0.87 to 1.94 log abundance) during the incubation largely because 16S rRNA genes increased by 1.21 log abundance. Throughout the incubation, the abundance of intI1, bla(ctx–m–32), sul(I), and erm(B) per gram in soil amended with HLAS-treated manure was lower than in soil amended with raw manure. Under low initial soil moisture conditions, HLAS treatment reduced the abundance of intI1 and resulted in loss of bla(ctx–m–32), sul(I), and erm(B)] compared to other treatment-moisture combinations. Although one might expect antibiotic resistance to be relatively unchanged after simulated winter manure application to soil, a variety of changes in diversity and relative abundance can be expected.","Miller, Daniel N.; Jurgens, Madison E.; Durso, Lisa M.; Schmidt, Amy M.",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33391241/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.611912,550

The response has ramped up over time, and has included various levels of: border control; advice on hygiene, physical distancing and mask wearing; advice to remain at home if unwell; and testing and tracing. A four-level Alert Level framework has guided key actions at different levels of risk. Strong leadership from the Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, and Director-General of Health and high levels of community co-operation have supported the response. The country is most vulnerable at its borders, where arrangements have been of concern; advice on testing and the wearing of masks has changed over time; while the use and distribution of personal protective equipment has also been of concern. The country overall was not well prepared for a pandemic, but policy-making has been nimble. Key challenges for 2021 include swiftly rolling out a vaccine, catching up on delayed health care, and deciding how and when the border can reopen.

Sheep erythrocytes fixed with glutaraldehyde, and then treated with tannic acid were coated with anti-bovine coronavirus rabbit antibodies purified by affinity chromatography using bovine coronavirus linked to Sepharose 4B. The RPHA test was carried out by a microtiter method. Erythrocytes coated with purified specific antibodies were agglutinated by bovine coronavirus, but not by bovine rotavirus or enterovirus. The reaction was inhibited by antiserum to bovine coronavirus, confirming the specificity of the reaction. The RPHA test detected bovine coronavirus in 13 of 22 fecal specimens (59 per cent), from natural cases of diarrhea, while the positive rates were only 14 per cent (3/22) and 22 per cent (5/22) for immunofluorescent staining of primary cultures of calf kidney cells infected with the specimens, and immune electron microscopy respectively.

Droplets and contacts serve as the main route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The characteristic of the disease is rather heterogeneous, ranging from no symptoms to critical illness. The factors associated with the outcome of COVID-19 have not been completely characterized to date. Inspired by previous studies on the relevance of infectious diseases, viral and host factors related to clinical outcomes have been identified. The severity of COVID-19 is mainly related to host factors, especially cellular immune responses in patients. Patients with mild COVID-19 and improved patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit a normal immune response to effectively eliminate the virus. The immune response in patients with fatal severe COVID-19 includes three stages: normal or hypofunction, hyperactivation, and anergy. Eventually, the patients were unable to resist viral infection and died. Based on our understanding of the kinetics of immune responses during COVID-19, we suggest that type I interferon (IFN) could be administered to patients with severe COVID-19 in the hypofunctional stage, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and glucocorticoid therapy could be administered in the immune hyperactivation stage. In addition, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulation therapy and anti-infective therapy with antibiotics are recommended in the hyperactivation stage.","Zhou, Xi; Ye, Qing",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33995364/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.646333,550

Formation of TRIs has been linked to the exposure of excess interferon (IFN), either from endogenous or exogenous sources. In renal disease, TRIs have been most commonly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and human immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Case reports of patients with renal biopsies showing TRIs without underlying SLE or HIV are infrequent in adults, and to our knowledge none have been reported in children. We report 3 pediatric cases in which the renal biopsy showed TRIs on electron microscopy without underlying SLE or HIV infection. The first patient presented at 2 years of age with nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. His renal biopsy revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and TRIs. The second patient presented at 6 months of age with infantile nephrotic syndrome, and his renal biopsy revealed membranous glomerulopathy and TRIs. The last patient presented at 4 years of age with acute kidney injury of unclear etiology leading to chronic kidney disease. Her biopsy revealed acute and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis with TRIs. Despite extensive evaluation in all 3 patients, including testing for HIV infection and SLE, we could not identify an underlying etiology to explain the presence of TRIs. In conclusion, renal biopsy with TRIs in the absence of underling SLE and HIV remains obscure. We propose a possible role for excess IFN triggered by an abnormal immune response to common viral infections in the formation of TRIs and renal injury.","Elmaghrabi, Ayah; Brown, Elizabeth; Khin, Ei; Hassler, Jared; Hendricks, Allen R.",Case Rep Nephrol Dial,https://doi.org/10.1159/000477661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28868299/,550

Notable contributions in biomedical field have been characterizing viral genomes, host transcriptomes and proteomes, repurposable drugs and vaccines. In one such study, 332 human proteins targeted by nCoV19 were identified. We expanded this set of host proteins by constructing their protein interactome, including in it not only the known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) but also novel, hitherto unknown PPIs predicted with our High-precision Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction (HiPPIP) model that was shown to be highly accurate. In fact, one of the earliest discoveries made possible by HiPPIP is related to activation of immunity upon viral infection. We found that several interactors of the host proteins are differentially expressed upon viral infection, are related to highly relevant pathways, and that the novel interaction of NUP98 with CHMP5 may activate an antiviral mechanism leading to disruption of viral budding. We are making the interactions available as downloadable files to facilitate future systems biology studies and also on a web-server at http://hagrid.dbmi.pitt.edu/corona that allows not only keyword search but also queries such as “PPIs where one protein is associated with ‘virus’ and the interactors with ‘pulmonary’”.","Karunakaran, Kalyani B.; Balakrishnan, N.; Ganapathiraju, Madhavi K.",Res Sq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32702714/; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-28592/v1,550
658899,The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pandemic of Lockdown Loneliness and the Role of Digital Technology,2020-11-05,"Neoliberalism has been allegedly challenged in East Central Europe. The neoliberal rollback by both nationalist forces and their economic nationalism in Hungary and Poland is commonly used to confirm this regional generalisation. In this generalisation, economic nationalism promotes anti-neoliberal state strategies because it challenges the economic globalism which was formerly privileged by the neoliberal globalist forces in these strategies. This paper challenges such a generalisation. Focusing on Czechia, it counterargues against this rollback thesis by stating that neoliberalism has overcome the global economic crisis and the political crisis of its austerity management. The transnational class approach is then offered as an alternative to the rollback scholarship: contrary to the rollback thesis, Czechia illustrates how economic nationalism can also promote neoliberalism. Moreover, Czech neoliberalism remains resilient because a pragmatic coalition of two neoliberal—nationalist and globalist—forces retains an enduring influence on the country’s economic strategies. These findings cultivate the regional generalisation but contribute subsequently to the broader debate on the worldwide rollback of neoliberal globalisation due to the political rise of economic nationalism.","Šitera, Daniel",J Int Relat Dev (Ljubl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33841045/; https://doi.org/10.1057/s41268-021-00214-2,550

The genes are best described in regional units. Among these, the best known is the polymorphic major histocompatibility complex-B (MHC-B) region containing genes for classical peptide antigen presentation. Nearby MHC-B is a small region containing two CD1 genes, which encode molecules known to bind lipid antigens and which will likely be found in chickens to present lipids to specialized T cells, as occurs with CD1 molecules in other species. Another region is the MHC-Y region, separated from MHC-B by an intervening region of tandem repeats. Like MHC-B, MHC-Y is polymorphic. It contains specialized class I and class II genes and c-type lectin-like genes. Yet another region, separated from MHC-Y by the single nucleolar organizing region (NOR) in the chicken genome, contains olfactory receptor genes and scavenger receptor genes, which are also thought to contribute to immunity. The structure, distribution, linkages and patterns of polymorphism in these regions, suggest GGA 16 evolves as a microchromosome devoted to immune defense. Many GGA 16 genes are polymorphic and polygenic. At the moment most disease associations are at the haplotype level. Roles of individual MHC genes in disease resistance are documented in only a very few instances. Provided suitable experimental stocks persist, the availability of increasingly detailed maps of GGA 16 genes combined with new means for detecting genetic variability will lead to investigations defining the contributions of individual loci and more applications for immunogenetics in breeding healthy poultry.","Miller, Marcia M.; Taylor, Robert L.",Poult Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119321583; https://doi.org/10.3382/ps/pev379; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119321583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26740135/,550

Therefore, further descriptions of the pathological processes in those animals that show symptoms similar to those described in humans affected by COVID-19 would be highly valuable. The potential for companion animals to contribute to the continued transmission and community spread of this known human-to-human disease is an urgent issue to be considered. Forty animals with pulmonary pathologies were studied by chest X-ray, ultrasound analysis, and computed tomography. Nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were analyzed to detect canine pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. An additional twenty healthy dogs living in SARS-CoV-2-positive households were included. Immunoglobulin detection by several immunoassays was performed. Our findings show that sick dogs presented severe alveolar or interstitial patterns with pulmonary opacity, parenchymal abnormalities, and bilateral lesions. The forty sick dogs were negative for SARS-CoV-2 but Mycoplasma spp. was detected in 26 of 33 dogs. Five healthy and one pathological dog presented IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Here we report that despite detecting dogs with α-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, we never obtained a positive RT-qPCR for SARS-SoV-2, not even in dogs with severe pulmonary disease; suggesting that even in the case of canine infection, transmission would be unlikely.

These measures should be improved particularly in developing countries. Studies need to be conducted to evaluate the worldwide evolution of antimicrobial resistance during the COVID-19 pandemic because pathogens do not respect borders. This issue takes on even greater importance in developing countries where scare data on resistance patterns and optimal conditions for infectious pathogen transmission coexist with the suboptimal treatment resources.","Lucien, Mentor Ali Ber; Canarie, Michael F.; Kilgore, Paul E.; Jean-Denis, Gladzdin; Fénélon, Natael; Pierre, Manise; Cerpa, Mauricio; Joseph, Gerard A.; Maki, Gina; Zervos, Marcus J.; Dely, Patrick; Boncy, Jacques; Sati, Hatim; del Rio, Ana; Ramon-Pardo, Pilar",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.12.087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33434666/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221000163; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221000163?v=s5,550
663093,Who Is More Satisfied with Health Services? A Cross-Sectional Study in China,2021-02-27,"A large number of investigations have been reported on minimising the PAH and PCDD/F yields during controlled combustion, such as incineration. This study is an attempt to quantify acute and chronic toxicants including PAH and PCDD/F in conditions relating to unwanted fires. This paper investigates distribution patterns of fire effluents between gas and aerosol phase, and the different particle size-ranges produced under different fire conditions. PVC carpet was selected as the fuel as a precursor for both PAH and PCDD/F. In order to generate fire effluents under controlled fire conditions, the steady-state tube furnace, was chosen as the physical fire model. Fire scenarios included oxidative pyrolysis, well-ventilated and under-ventilated fires. Fire effluent measurements included: carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen chloride, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated dibenzo-dioxins and furans and soot. The distribution patterns between gas and particle phase, and the size-ranges of the particles produced in these fires together with their chemical composition is also reported. Significant quantities of respirable submicron particles were detected, together with a range of PAHs. Lower levels of halogenated dioxins were detected in the fire residue compared with those found in other studies. Nevertheless, the findings do have implications for the health and safety of fire and rescue personnel, fire investigators, and other individuals exposed to the residue from unwanted fires.","Stec, A.A.; Readman, J.; Blomqvist, P.; Gylestam, D.; Karlsson, D.; Wojtalewicz, D.; Dlugogorski, B.Z.",Chemosphere,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004565351200968X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.07.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22960058/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004565351200968X,550

While primary DENV2 infections stimulate serotype-specific protective responses, a leading vaccine failed to induce a similar protective response. Using human monoclonal antibodies (hMAbs) isolated from dengue cases and structure-guided design of a chimeric DENV, here we describe the major site on the DENV2 envelope (E) protein targeted by neutralizing antibodies. DENV2-specific neutralizing hMAb 2D22 binds to a quaternary structure epitope. We engineered and recovered a recombinant DENV4 that displayed the 2D22 epitope. DENV2 neutralizing antibodies in people exposed to infection or a live vaccine tracked with the 2D22 epitope on the DENV4/2 chimera. The chimera remained sensitive to DENV4 antibodies, indicating that the major neutralizing epitopes on DENV2 and -4 are at different sites. The ability to transplant a complex epitope between DENV serotypes demonstrates a hitherto underappreciated structural flexibility in flaviviruses, which could be harnessed to develop new vaccines and diagnostics.","Gallichotte, E.

665117,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the level of depression among health care workers: cross-sectional study,2021-05-17,"INTRODUCTION: Studies suggest that patients with cancer are more likely to experience severe outcomes from COVID-19. Therefore, cancer centers have undertaken efforts to care for patients with cancer in COVID-free units. Nevertheless, the frequency and relevance of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 in patients with cancer remain unknown. The goal of this study was to determine the incidence and impact of hospital-acquired COVID-19 in this population and identify predictive factors for COVID-19 severity in patients with cancer. METHODS: Patients with cancer and a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were prospectively identified using provincial registries and hospital databases between March 3(rd) and May 23(rd), 2020 in the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia in Canada. Patient’s baseline characteristics including age, sex, comorbidities, cancer type, and type of anti-cancer treatment were collected. The exposure of interest was incidence of hospital-acquired infection defined by diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 ≥ 5 days after hospital admission for COVID-unrelated cause. Co-primary outcomes were death or composite outcomes of severe illness from COVID-19 such as hospitalization, supplemental oxygen, intensive-care unit (ICU) admission and/or mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 252 patients (N=249 adult, and N=3 pediatric) with COVID-19 and cancer were identified, and the majority were residents of Quebec (N=233). One-hundred-and-six patients (42.1%) received active anti-cancer treatment in the last 3 months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. During a median follow-up of 25 days, 33 (13.1%) required admission to the ICU, and 71 (28.2%) died. Forty-seven (19.1%) had a diagnosis of hospital-acquired COVID-19. Median overall survival was shorter in those with hospital-acquired infection, compared to a contemporary community-acquired population (27 days vs unreached, HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.4, p=0.0006). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that hospital-acquired COVID-19, age, ECOG status, and advanced stage of cancer were independently associated with death. INTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates a high rate of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19, associated with increased mortality in both univariate and multivariate analysis in the cancer population, reinforcing the importance of treating patients with cancer in COVID-free units. We also validated that age and advanced cancer were negative predictive factors for COVID-19 severity in patients with cancer.","Elkrief, Arielle; Desilets, Antoine; Papneja, Neha; Cvetkovic, Lena; Groleau, Catherine; Lakehal, Yahia Abdelali; Shbat, Layla; Richard, Corentin; Malo CCRP, Julie; Belkaid, Wiam; Cook, Erin; Doucet, Stéphane; Tran, Thai Hoa; Jao, Kevin; Daaboul, Nathalie; Bhang, Eric; Loree, Jonathan M.; Miller, Wilson H.; Vinh, Donald C.; Bouganim, Nathaniel; Batist, Gerald; Letendre, Caroline; Routy, Bertrand",Eur J Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.08.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33035991/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959804920304688; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804920304688?v=s5,550
666026,Redesigning a Web-Based Stakeholder Consensus Meeting About Core Outcomes for Clinical Trials: Formative Feedback Study,2021-08-19,"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a rapidly growing pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Its papain-like protease (SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) is a crucial target to halt virus replication. SARS-CoV PLpro and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro share an 82.9% sequence identity and a 100% sequence identity for the binding site reported to accommodate small molecules in SARS-CoV. The flexible key binding site residues Tyr269 and Gln270 for small-molecule recognition in SARS-CoV PLpro exist also in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. This inspired us to use the reported small-molecule binders to SARS-CoV PLpro to generate a high-quality DEKOIS 2.0 benchmark set. Accordingly, we used them in a cross-benchmarking study against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. As there is no SARS-CoV-2 PLpro structure complexed with a small-molecule ligand publicly available at the time of manuscript submission, we built a homology model based on the ligand-bound SARS-CoV structure for benchmarking and docking purposes. Three publicly available docking tools FRED, AutoDock Vina, and PLANTS were benchmarked. All showed better-than-random performances, with FRED performing best against the built model. Detailed performance analysis via pROC-Chemotype plots showed a strong enrichment of the most potent bioactives in the early docking ranks. Cross-benchmarking against the X-ray structure complexed with a peptide-like inhibitor confirmed that FRED is the best-performing tool. Furthermore, we performed cross-benchmarking against the newly introduced X-ray structure complexed with a small-molecule ligand. Interestingly, its benchmarking profile and chemotype enrichment were comparable to the built model. Accordingly, we used FRED in a prospective virtual screen of the DrugBank database. In conclusion, this study provides an example of how to harness a custom-made DEKOIS 2.0 benchmark set as an approach to enhance the virtual screening success rate against a vital target of the rapidly emerging pandemic.","Ibrahim, Tamer M.; Ismail, Muhammad I.; Bauer, Matthias R.; Bekhit, Adnan A.; Boeckler, Frank M.",Front Chem,https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2020.592289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33251185/,550

METHODS: The data for this cross-sectional study were derived from the Student Mental Health Survey conducted from May 20 to June 16, 2020 at a national university in Akita prefecture. Among the 5111 students recruited, 2712 participated in this study (response rate, 53%; mean age ± standard deviation, 20.5 ±3.5 years; men, 53.8%). Depressive symptoms were identified by using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate depressive symptoms based on a PHQ-9 score ≥10 and suicide-related ideation based on question 9 of PHQ-9 ≥1, which encompasses thoughts of both suicide and self-harm, was 11.7% and 6.7%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that risk factors for depression included being a woman, smoking, alcohol consumption, and social network communication using either video or voice. For suicide-related ideation, alcohol consumption was the only risk factor. Exercise and having someone to consult about worries were associated with decreased risk of both depressive symptoms and suicide-related ideation. CONCLUSIONS: Negative lifestyles of smoking and drinking, and being a woman, may be important risk factors for depressive symptoms, whereas exercise and having someone to consult about worries may be protective factors.

METHODS: This study used data from the Global COVID-19 Index provided by PEMANDU Associates. The sample, representing 161 countries, comprised the number of confirmed cases, deaths, stringency indices, population density and GNI per capita (USD). Correlation matrices were computed to reveal the association between the variables at three time points: day-30, day-60 and day-90. Three separate principal component analyses were computed for similar time points, and several standardized plots were produced. RESULTS: Confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 showed positive but weak correlation with stringency and GNI per capita. Through principal component analysis, the first two principal components captured close to 70% of the variance of the data. The first component can be viewed as the severity of the COVID-19 surge in countries, whereas the second component largely corresponded to population density, followed by GNI per capita of countries. Multivariate visualization of the two dominating principal components provided a standardized comparison of the situation in the161 countries, performed on day-30, day-60 and day-90 since the first confirmed cases in countries worldwide. CONCLUSION: Visualization of the global spread of COVID-19 showed the unequal severity of the pandemic across continents and over time. Distinct patterns in clusters of countries, which separated many European countries from those in Africa, suggested a contrast in terms of stringency measures and wealth of a country. The African continent appeared to fare better in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic and the burden of mortality in the first 90 days. A noticeable worsening trend was observed in several countries in the same relative time frame of the disease’s first 90 days, especially in the United States of America.","Teh, Jane K.

Several vaccines have been developed to control the COVID-19, but the potential effectiveness of the mucosal vaccine remains to be documented. In this study, we constructed a recombinant L. plantarum LP18:RBD expressing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein via the surface anchoring route. The amount of the RBD protein was maximally expressed under the culture condition with 200 ng/mL of inducer at 33 °C for 6 h. Further, we evaluated the immune response in mice via the intranasal administration of LP18:RBD. The results showed that the LP18:RBD significantly elicited RBD-specific mucosal IgA antibodies in respiratory tract and intestinal tract. The percentages of CD3 + CD4+ T cells in spleens of mice administrated with the LP18:RBD were also significantly increased. This indicated that LP18:RBD could induce a humoral immune response at the mucosa, and it could be used as a mucosal vaccine candidate against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We provided the first experimental evidence that the recombinant L. plantarum LP18:RBD could initiate immune response in vivo, which implies that the mucosal immunization using recombinant LAB system could be a promising vaccination strategy to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Letian; Wang, Maopeng; Hao, Jiayi; Han, Jicheng; Fu, Tingting; Bai, Jieying; Tian, Mingyao; Jin, Ningyi; Zhu, Guangze; Li, Chang",Int J Biol Macromol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0141813021019097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34499954/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.08.232; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813021019097?v=s5,550

However, the epidemiological literature from Pakistan is scanty. Methods We retrospectively analyzed data from 412 patients who were residents of East Karachi and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between February 26 to April 24, 2020. Patients' demographics, symptoms, travel and contact history, and outcomes were recorded. All statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Results Most of the patients were male (64.6%), the majority (43.3%) belonging to the 21- to 40-year age group. Most of the patients (65.5%) were residents of Gulshan Iqbal. A total of 15.8% of the patients were admitted to the hospital, and 3.9% of patients expired. The three most common presenting symptoms were fever (74.8%), cough (60.4%), and flu (35.5%). The majority of patients (89.3%) gave a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 patients. Conclusion The number of SARS-CoV-2 cases is rapidly increasing in Karachi, Pakistan. There is a need to educate the population about the most common sign and symptoms of the virus so that individuals can identify these symptoms and get themselves tested.

The diffusion of the virus is analyzed with logistic-curve fits on the 25 countries most affected at the time of the writing and in which the diffusion curve was more than 95% completed. A negative correlation observed between the final number of infections and the slope of the logistic curve corroborates a result obtained long time ago via an extensive simulation study. There is both theoretical arguments and experimental evidence for the existence of such correlations. The flattening of the curve results in a retardation of the curve's midpoint, which entails an increase in the final number of infections. It is possible that more lives are lost at the end by this process. Our analysis also permits evaluation of the various governments' interventions in terms of rapidity of response, efficiency of the actions taken (the amount of flattening achieved), and the number of days by which the curve was delayed. Not surprisingly, early decisive response proves to be the optimum strategy among the countries studied.","Debecker, A.; Modis, T.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.09.20126128; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.09.20126128v1?rss=1,550

This thesis is fundamentally at odds with an overwhelming consensus in contemporary bioethics that the principle of respect for autonomy, while important in everyday clinical encounters, must be “curtailed,” “constrained,” or “overridden” by other principles in times of crisis. I contend that bioethicists have embraced an indefensibly “thin” notion of autonomy that uproots the concept from its foundations in Kantian ethics. According to this thin conception, respect for autonomy, if unconditioned by competing principles (beneficence, justice, non-maleficence) would give competent adults the right to do anything they desired to do so long as they satisfied certain baseline psychological conditions. I argue that the dominant “principlist” model of bioethical reasoning depends on this thin view of autonomy and show how it deprives us of powerful analytical tools that would help us to think seriously about the foundations of human rights, justice, and law. Then, I offer a brief sketch of a “thick,” historically-grounded notion of autonomy and show what we could gain by taking it seriously.","Reis-Dennis, Samuel",J Law Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32728471/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jlb/lsaa037,550

METHODS: We collected 79 respiratory samples from 59 patients monitored in an outpatient center or in the intensive care unit of the University Hospital Regensburg. We analyzed viral load by quantitative real-time PCR, viral antigen by point-of-care assay, time since onset of symptoms and presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the context of virus isolation from respiratory specimen. RESULTS: The odds ratio for virus isolation increased 1.9-fold for each log(10) level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and 7.4-fold with detection of viral antigen, while it decreased 6.3-fold beyond 10 days of symptoms and 20.0-fold with presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The latter was confirmed for B.1.1.7 strains. The positive predictive value for virus isolation was 60.0% for viral loads above 10 (7) RNA copies/mL and 50.0% for the presence of viral antigen.

674042,P38: Mental health of patients with psoriasis during the COVID‐19 pandemic: a cross‐sectional study in a tertiary setting,2021-07-06,"A number of papers have appeared recently arguing for the conclusion that it is ethically acceptable to infect healthy volunteers with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 as part of research projects aimed at developing COVID-19 vaccines or treatments. This position has also been endorsed in a statement by a working group for the WHO. The papers generally argue that controlled human infection (CHI) is ethically acceptable if (1) the risks to participants are low and therefore acceptable, (2) the scientific quality of the research is high, (3) the research has high social value, (4) participants give full informed consent, and (5) there is fair selection of participants. All five conditions are necessary premises in the overall argument that such research is ethically acceptable. The arguments concerning risk and informed consent have already been critically discussed in the literature. This paper therefore looks specifically at the arguments relating to condition 3 ‘high social value’ and condition 5 ‘fair selection of participants’ and shows that whereas they may be valid, they are not sound. It is highly unlikely that the conditions that are necessary for ethical CHI trials to take place will be fulfilled. Most, if not all, CHI trials will thus be well intentioned but unethical.","Holm, Søren",J Med Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32616623/,550

Understanding the drivers and impacts of this financial health burden is both an economic and a public health priority. OBJECTIVE: This study examines how the burden of OOP health expenditures varies with different thresholds for financial catastrophe. METHODS: The analysis is based on Livings Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS)-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (ISA) for five SSA countries—Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda. We estimate the degree by which OOP payments as share of total household non-food expenditures exceed either the 15 or 25% threshold. RESULTS: For the countries considered, the severity of OOP payments is substantial—the average positive overshoot (beyond the 25% threshold) is above 10%, except for Nigeria. This reflects a higher percentage of OOP in total household health expenditures—compared to taxes and contributions—especially among the poor in these specific countries. Regarding sensitivity of distribution of catastrophic health expenditures, we find that households with low non-food expenditures are more likely to incur catastrophic payments with the exception for Uganda where catastrophic payments increase with the increase of non-food household expenditures. CONCLUSION: The burden of catastrophic health expenditures remains large. In order to reduce this burden, public health expenditures need to be expanded as an alternative. This calls for renewed attention to expand public revenues as the most sustainable methods of financing health expenditures in Africa.","Ssewanyana, Sarah; Kasirye, Ibrahim",Appl Health Econ Health Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32909224/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-020-00609-1,550

When they occur, neurological conditions most commonly involve the central nervous system, and peripheral nervous system effects, particularly in the extremities, have been less commonly described. The mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy in critically ill patients with COVID-19 are likely to be multifactorial, and extremity peripheral nerve imaging in these cases has not been well described. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case series, we describe the magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) findings in 3 critically ill patients who presented with new onset of peripheral neuropathies in the extremities, and we discuss possible common mechanisms of nerve injury, including the role of position-related nerve injury. CONCLUSIONS: MRN can be useful in identifying and localizing peripheral nerve abnormalities in the extremities of COVID-19 patients, and patients who are placed in the prone position during ventilation may be more susceptible to these injuries.","Omar, Imran M.; Garg, Ankur",Pol J Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34322190/; https://doi.org/10.5114/pjr.2021.107727,550

Establishment of local immunity in the intestine would thus prevent TGEV transmission. CpG DNA has been reported as a promising mucosal adjuvant in some animals. The effects of oral immunization of CpG DNA together with inactivated TGEV (ITGEV) were investigated in this study. Pigs (6 weeks old) were orally immunized with ITGEV plus CpG DNA. The TGEV-specific IgA level in the intestinal tract and the TGEV-specific IgG level in serum significantly increased following immunization with ITGEV plus CpG DNA (P ≤ 0.05). Moreover, populations of IgA-secreting cells, CD3+ T lymphocytes and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), in the intestine increased significantly after immunization with ITGEV plus CpG DNA (P ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, the expression of IL-6, IL-12 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in ligated intestine segments increased significantly after injection with ITGEV plus CpG DNA (P ≤ 0.05). Taken together, these data suggest that oral immunization of ITGEV plus CpG DNA elicits a local immune response.

676739,From Intensive Care to Step-Down Units: Managing Patients Throughput in Response to COVID-19,2020-08-11,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious, acute respiratory disease caused mainly by person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Its emergence has caused a world-wide acute health crisis, intensified by the challenge of reliably identifying individuals likely to transmit the disease. Diagnosis is hampered by the many unknowns surrounding this disease, including those relating to infectious viral burden. This uncertainty is exacerbated by disagreement surrounding the clinical relevance of molecular testing using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for the presence of viral RNA, most often based on the reporting of quantification cycles (Cq), which is also termed the cycle threshold (Ct) or crossing point (Cp). Despite it being common knowledge that Cqs are relative values varying according to a wide range of different parameters, there have been efforts to use them as though they were absolute units, with Cqs below an arbitrarily determined value, deemed to signify a positive result and those above, a negative one. Our results investigated the effects of a range of common variables on Cq values. These data include a detailed analysis of the effect of different carrier molecules on RNA extraction. The impact of sample matrix of buccal swabs and saliva on RNA extraction efficiency was demonstrated in RT-qPCR and the impact of potentially inhibiting compounds in urine along with bile salts were investigated in RT-digital PCR (RT-dPCR). The latter studies were performed such that the impact on the RT step could be separated from the PCR step. In this way, the RT was shown to be more susceptible to inhibitors than the PCR. Together, these studies demonstrate that the consequent variability of test results makes subjective Cq cut-off values unsuitable for the identification of infectious individuals. We also discuss the importance of using reliable control materials for accurate quantification and highlight the substantial role played by dPCR as a method for their development.","Whale, Alexandra S.; von der Heide, Eva K.; Kohlenberg, Max; Brinckmann, Anja; Baedker, Silke; Karalay, Oezlem; Fernandez-Gonzalez, Ana; Busby, Eloise J.; Bustin, Stephen A.; Hauser, Heiko; Missel, Andreas; O'Sullivan, Denise M.; Huggett, Jim F.; Pfaffl, Michael W.; Nolan, Tania",Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2021.08.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1046202321002048; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202321002048?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34454016/,550

We found that the IFN-β production was significantly suppressed during PEDV infection in cells. To identify viral IFN antagonists and to study their suppressive function, viral coding sequences for the entire structural and nonstructural proteins were cloned and expressed. Of 16 PEDV nonstructural proteins (nsps), nsp1, nsp3, nsp7, nsp14, nsp15 and nsp16 were found to inhibit the IFN-β and IRF3 promoter activities. The sole accessory protein ORF3, structure protein envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) protein were also shown to inhibit such activities. PEDV nsp1 did not interfere the IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation but interrupted the enhanceosome assembly of IRF3 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) by degrading CBP. A further study showed that the CBP degradation by nsp1 was proteasome-dependent. Our data demonstrate that PEDV modulates the host innate immune responses by degrading CBP and suppressing ISGs expression.","Zhang, Qingzhan; Shi, Kaichuang; Yoo, Dongwan",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.12.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682215005310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26773386/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215005310,550

We aimed to explore the role of hydroxychloroquine therapy in mildly symptomatic patients diagnosed in the outpatient setting. Methods: We examined the association between outpatient hydroxychloroquine exposure and the subsequent progression of disease among mildly symptomatic non-hospitalized patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome assessed was requirement of hospitalization. Data was obtained from a retrospective review of electronic health records within a New Jersey USA multi-hospital network. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those who did not applying a multivariable logistic model with propensity matching. Results: Among 1274 outpatients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection 7.6% were prescribed hydroxychloroquine. In a 1067 patient propensity matched cohort, 21.6% with outpatient exposure to hydroxychloroquine were hospitalized, and 31.4% without exposure were hospitalized. In the primary multivariable logistic regression analysis with propensity matching there was an association between exposure to hydroxychloroquine and a decreased rate of hospitalization from COVID-19 (OR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29, 0.95). Sensitivity analyses revealed similar associations. QTc prolongation events occurred in 2% of patients prescribed hydroxychloroquine with no reported arrhythmia events among those with data available. Conclusions: In this retrospective observational study of SARS-CoV-2 infected non-hospitalized patients hydroxychloroquine exposure was associated with a decreased rate of subsequent hospitalization. Additional exploration of hydroxychloroquine in this mildly symptomatic outpatient population is warranted.","Ip, A.; Ahn, J.; Zhou, Y.; Goy, A. H.; Hansen, E.; Pecora, A. L.; Sinclaire, B.

This study aims to identify the causes of this health disparity, determine prognostic indicators, and assess efficacy of treatment interventions. Method We performed a retrospective cohort study of clinical features and laboratory data of COVID-19 patients admitted over a five-week period at the height of the pandemic in the United States. This study was performed at an urban academic medical center in New York City, declared a COVID-only facility, serving a majority Black population Result Of the 1,070 consecutive patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 496 critically ill patients were hospitalized and included in the study. 88% of patients were Black; and a majority (53%) were 61-80 years old with a mean body mass index in the 'obese' range. 97% had one or more comorbidities. Hypertension was the most common (84%) pre-existing condition followed by diabetes mellitus (57%) and chronic kidney disease (24%). Patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease who received hemodialysis were found to have significantly lower mortality, then those who did not receive it, suggesting benefit from hemodialysis (11%, OR, 0.35, CI, 0.17 - 0.69 P=0.001). Age >60 years and coronary artery disease were independent predictors of mortality in multivariate analysis. Cox Proportional Hazards modeling for time to death demonstrated a significantly high ratio for COPD/Asthma, and favorable effects on outcomes for pre-admission ACE inhibitors and ARBs. CRP (180, 283 mg/L), LDH (551, 638 U/L), glucose (182, 163 mg/dL), procalcitonin (1.03, 1.68 ng/mL), and neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio (8.5, 10.0) were predictive of mortality on admission and at 48-96 hrs. Of the 496 inpatients, 48% died, one third of patients died within the first three days of admission. 54/488 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, of which 87% died and of the remaining patients, 32% died. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients in our predominantly Black neighborhood had higher mortality, likely due to higher prevalence of comorbidities. Early dialysis and pre-admission intake of ACE inhibitors/ARBs improved patient outcomes. Early escalation of care based on comorbidities and key laboratory indicators is critical for improving outcomes in African-American patients.","Gupta, R.; Agrawal, R.; Bukhari, Z.; Jabbar, A.; Wang, D.; Diks, J.; Alshal, M.; Emechebe, D.

We previously found that tail amputation leads to reactivation of a developmental-like program in spinal cord ependymal cells (Rodrigo Albors et al., 2015), characterized by a high-proliferation zone emerging 4 days post-amputation (Rost et al., 2016). What underlies this spatiotemporal pattern of cell proliferation, however, remained unknown. Here, we use modeling, tightly linked to experimental data, to demonstrate that this regenerative response is consistent with a signal that recruits ependymal cells during ~85 hours after amputation within ~830 μm of the injury. We adapted Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator (FUCCI) technology to axolotls (AxFUCCI) to visualize cell cycles in vivo. AxFUCCI axolotls confirmed the predicted appearance time and size of the injury-induced recruitment zone and revealed cell cycle synchrony between ependymal cells.

682247,Unknown Enemy and Psychopathological Responses: A Cross-Sectional Nationwide Study Assessing the Knowledge About COVID-19,2021-08-11,"BACKGROUND: Current mitigation strategies for SARS-CoV-2 rely on population-wide adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Monitoring NPI adoption, mobility patterns and their association with SARS-CoV-2 infection can provide key information for public health agencies and be used to calibrate transmission models. METHODS: We used an online panel to accrue representative samples from Florida, Illinois, and Maryland (n=3,009, approximately 1,000 per state) from July 15–31, 2020 and capture socio-demographically and geographically resolved information about NPI adoption and mobility in the prior 2 weeks. Logistic regression was used to identify correlates of self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection in the prior 2 weeks. RESULTS: Overall, 96% reported traveling outside their home in the prior 2 weeks, the most common reason being to visit a grocery store/pharmacy (92%), followed by visiting friends/family (61%), and visiting a place of worship (23%); 22% reporting public transportation use. In total, 44% of respondents reported always practicing social distancing and 40% reported always using a mask indoors and outdoors. Overall, 74 (2.5%) reported testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the prior 2 weeks, with strong dose-response relationships between several forms of movement frequency and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Variables capturing mobility were all highly correlated with one another, suggesting there are clusters of individuals who engage in multiple activities (Figure); 41% of positive cases engaged in all forms of mobility captured compared to 1% of those who did not test positive within the prior 2 weeks. Patterns of mobility and NPI uptake did not significantly differ by state; however, there were significant relationships with age, race/ethnicity, and gender. In multivariable models including adjustment for NPIs, significant relationships remained with public transportation, visiting a place of worship, and participating in outdoor group fitness activities. Figure. Heatmap depicting pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients between survey responses. Pairwise correlation coefficients are displayed in the boxes at intersection of any two variables. Questions were asked with respect activities in the prior 2 weeks. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: NPI adoption and mobility did not vary across these three states with variable policies and SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates. Rather, associations with recent positivity appear to be driven largely by mobility patterns and engagement in activities where NPI use may be challenging or inconsistent.

683019,Rhinovirus species and clinical features in children hospitalised with pneumonia from Mozambique,2016-07-26,"OBJECTIVES: Adderall (amphetamine-dextroamphetamine) is a controlled substance with harmful adverse effects if abused or misused. We assessed the availability of Adderall from common search engines, and evaluated the safety and marketing characteristics of online pharmacies selling Adderall. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: From December 2019 to February 2020, the phrase “buy Adderall online” was queried in four search engines: Google (N = 100), Bing (N = 100), Yahoo (N = 50) and DuckDuckGo (N = 50). Online pharmacies that claimed to sell Adderall and had unique Uniform Resource Locators, were active, free-access, and in English language were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: Online pharmacies were categorized as rogue, unclassified, or legitimate on the basis of LegitScript classifications. Safety and marketing characteristics, and costs were collected. RESULTS: Of the 62 online pharmacies found to sell Adderall, 61 were rogue or unclassified. Across all rogue and unclassified online pharmacies, prescriptions were not required (100%), pharmacist services were not offered (100%), and quantity limits were not placed on the number of Adderall purchases (100%). Rogue and unclassified online pharmacies appealed to cost, offering price discounts (61%), bulk discounts (67%), and coupon codes (70%). Contrary to their claims, cheaper prices were available for all formulations and dosages of Adderall from GoodRx than from these online pharmacies. Rogue and unclassified online pharmacies promoted and enabled the illicit purchase of Adderall, appealing to privacy (74%), offering purchase through cryptocurrency (74%), and claiming registration or accreditation of their sites (33%). CONCLUSION: Rogue online pharmacies are pervasive in search engine results, enabling the illicit purchase of Adderall without a prescription. Consumers are at risk of purchasing Adderall, a medication with high abuse potential, from unsafe sources. Law enforcement, regulatory agencies, and search engines should work to further protect consumers from unregistered and illegitimate online pharmacies selling Adderall.","Penley, Benjamin; Chen, Hui-Han; Eckel, Stephen F.; Ozawa, Sachiko",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1544319120303472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912756/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544319120303472; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2020.07.022,550
683584,"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice toward COVID-19 among UAE Residents: An Online Cross-Sectional Survey",2021-06-16,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are an important cause of the considerable morbidity and mortality found in COPD. COPD exacerbations increase with increasing severity of COPD, and some patients are prone to frequent exacerbations leading to hospital admission and readmission. These frequent exacerbations may have considerable impact on quality of life and activities of daily living. Factors that increase the risk for COPD exacerbations are associated with increased airway inflammation caused by common pollutants and bacterial and/or viral infections. These inflammatory responses cause mucus hypersecretion and, thereby, airway obstruction and associated exacerbations. While chronic mucus hypersecretion is a significant risk factor for frequent and severe exacerbations, patients with chronic mucus hypersecretion have a lower rate of relapse after initial treatment for acute exacerbation. The benefit of antibiotics for treatment of COPD exacerbations is small but significant. While the mechanisms of actions are not clear, mucolytic agents reduce the number of days of disability in subjects with exacerbations. Reducing mucous cell numbers in small airways could be a useful way to reduce chronic mucus hypersecretion. Our studies suggest that programmed cell death is crucial in the resolution of metaplastic mucous cells, and understanding these mechanisms may provide novel therapies to reduce the risk of COPD exacerbations.","Tesfaigzi, Yohannes; Meek, Paula; Lareau, Suzanne",Clin Appl Immunol Rev,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cair.2006.02.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1529104906000201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288656/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1529104906000201,550
683939,"Access to Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) Services Among Urban Refugees and Asylum Seekers, Relative to the Thai Population, 2019: A Case Study in Bangkok, Thailand",2021-08-17,"Griffithsin is a marine algal lectin that exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity by binding oligomannose glycans on viral envelope glycoproteins, including those found in HIV-1, HSV-2, SARS, HCV and other enveloped viruses. An efficient, scalable and cost-effective manufacturing process for Griffithsin is essential for the adoption of this drug in human antiviral prophylaxis and therapy, particularly in cost-sensitive indications such as topical microbicides for HIV-1 prevention. The production of certain classes of recombinant biologics in plants can offer scalability, cost and environmental impact advantages over traditional biomanufacturing platforms. Previously, we showed the technical viability of producing recombinant Griffithsin in plants. In this study, we conducted a technoeconomic analysis (TEA) of plant-produced Griffithsin manufactured at commercial launch volumes for use in HIV microbicides. Data derived from multiple non-sequential manufacturing batches conducted at pilot scale and existing facility designs were used to build a technoeconomic model using SuperPro Designer(®) modeling software. With an assumed commercial launch volume of 20 kg Griffithsin/year for 6.7 million doses of Griffithsin microbicide at 3 mg/dose, a transient vector expression yield of 0.52 g Griffithsin/kg leaf biomass, recovery efficiency of 70%, and purity of >99%, we calculated a manufacturing cost for the drug substance of $0.32/dose and estimated a bulk product cost of $0.38/dose assuming a 20% net fee for a contract manufacturing organization (CMO). This is the first report modeling the manufacturing economics of Griffithsin. The process analyzed is readily scalable and subject to efficiency improvements and could provide the needed market volumes of the lectin within an acceptable range of costs, even for cost-constrained products such as microbicides. The manufacturing process was also assessed for environmental, health and safety impact and found to have a highly favorable environmental output index with negligible risks to health and safety. The results of this study help validate the plant-based manufacturing platform and should assist in selecting preferred indications for Griffithsin as a novel drug.","Alam, Aatif; Jiang, Linda; Kittleson, Gregory A.; Steadman, Kenneth D.; Nandi, Somen; Fuqua, Joshua L.; Palmer, Kenneth E.; Tusé, Daniel; McDonald, Karen A.",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30087892/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2018.00102,550

Designing specific STAT3 inhibitors will thus provide new options for use as IFN therapy. Herein, we identified a novel small molecule, dimethyl 2-(4-(2-(methyl(phenyl(p-tolyl)methyl)amino)ethoxy)benzyl)malonate (CIB-6), which can inhibit the IFN-α-induced interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) luciferase reporter (IC(50) value = 6.4 μM) and potentiate the antiproliferative effect of IFN-α in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. CIB-6 was found to bind to the STAT3 Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, thereby selectively inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation without affecting Janus kinases and STAT1/2. CIB-6 also inhibited the migration and invasion of HCC cells by inhibiting the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Mechanistically, CIB-6 reduced the expression of β-catenin (an EMT key protein) via upregulating β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) and curbed nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) activation through restricting the phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) kinase (IKK) via STAT3 inhibition. Treatment with CIB-6 significantly retarded tumor growth in nude mice with SK-HEP-1 xenografts. In addition, clinical sample analysis revealed that lower β-TrCP and higher β-catenin expression could affect the median survival time of HCC patients. Our findings suggest that CIB-6 could be a new therapeutic strategy for HCC therapy through STAT3-mediated β-TrCP/β-catenin/NF-κB axis.","Peng, Ting; Wonganan, Orawan; Zhang, Zhonghui; Yu, Jialing; Xi, Ruiying; Cao, Yu; Suksamrarn, Apichart; Zhang, Guolin; Wang, Fei",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22073354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33805945/,550

To achieve this objective, we use the pooled mean group-autoregressive distributed lag methodology (PMG-ARDL) and Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality test on 22 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries between 1985 and 2017. The PMG-ARDL estimation shows that energy use and economic policy uncertainties have a positive relationship with carbon dioxide emission (CO(2)) emission, while a negative relationship is confirmed between renewable and CO(2) emissions in the long run. The short-run estimation shows a positive relationship between energy use, real gross domestic product, and per capita on CO(2) emissions. The Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality results highlight a unidirectional running from real GDP and GDP per capita square to CO(2) emissions. Furthermore, one-way causality exists between CO(2) emissions to economic policy uncertainties. These results have policy implications on the macroeconomy which are discussed in detail in the concluding section.","Zakari, Abdulrasheed; Adedoyin, Festus Fatai; Bekun, Festus Victor",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14463-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34008064/,550

This work reviews the literature to propose a holistic view of the disinfection process where the decision variables, such as type and concentration of active substances, are optimised to guarantee the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other usual pathogens and spoilage microorganisms while minimising possible side-effects on the environment and animal and human health.","Pedreira, Adrián; Taşkın, Yeşim; García, Míriam R.",Foods,https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10020283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33572531/,550

Thus, individuals with physical disabilities such as children with cerebral palsy can no longer benefit from physical rehabilitation during this undetermined period. Using either a synchronous or asynchronous format, in collaboration with a therapist via telerehabilitation, we suggest that active video games and low-cost virtual reality are a promising delivery mode for at-home rehabilitation in the context of a global pandemic. This therapeutic modality, incorporated into an at-home individualized treatment plan, provides a means to lessen the impact of an interruption in rehabilitation services while not loosing the pre-pandemic, in-person physical activity gains. Growing evidence supports active video games and low-cost virtual reality as viable therapeutic interventions for children with physical disabilities. These technologies are especially well-accepted by pediatric populations for the ludic and motivating features that lend themselves to nearly seamless incorporation into telerehabilitation. Advantages for rehabilitation of active video games and low-cost virtual reality include a rich, challenging, multi-modal training environment in which high numbers of movement repetitions can be accomplished, and a unique opportunity to foster engaged practice actions that go beyond household activities. We offer suggestions for the clinician about how to adopt active video games and low-cost virtual reality into your practice during a global pandemic.","Demers, Marika; Martinie, Ophélie; Winstein, Carolee; Robert, Maxime T.",Front Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.601898; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33381077/,550

Uremic toxins have been divided into 3 groups: small substances dissolved in water, medium molecules: peptides and low molecular weight proteins, and protein-bound toxins. One of the earliest known toxins is urea, the concentration of which was considered negligible in CKD patients. However, subsequent studies have shown that it can lead to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and induce insulin resistance in vitro and in vivo, as well as cause carbamylation of proteins, peptides, and amino acids. Other uremic toxins and their participation in the damage caused by oxidative stress to biological material are also presented. Macromolecules and molecules modified as a result of carbamylation, oxidative stress, and their adducts with uremic toxins, may lead to cardiovascular diseases, and increased risk of mortality in patients with CKD.","Pieniazek, Anna; Bernasinska-Slomczewska, Joanna; Gwozdzinski, Lukasz",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201270/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22126196,550
