2728,Biosafety and Biosecurity in European Containment Level 3 Laboratories: Focus on French Recent Progress and Essential Requirements,2017-05-31,"Even if European Union (EU) Member States are obliged to implement EU Directives 2000/54/EC on the protection of workers from risks related to exposure to biological agents at work, national biosafety regulations and practices varied from country to country. In fact, EU legislation on biological agents and genetically modified microorganisms is often not specific enough to ensure harmonization leading to difficulties in implementation for most laboratories. In the same way, biosecurity is a relatively new concept and a few EU Member States are known to have introduced national laboratory biosecurity legislation. In France, recent regulations have reinforced biosafety/biosecurity in containment level 3 (CL-3) laboratories but they concern a specific list of pathogens with no correlation in other European Members States. The objective of this review was to summarize European biosafety/biosecurity measures concerning CL-3 facilities focusing on French specificities. Essential requirements needed to preserve efficient biosafety measures when manipulating risk group 3 biological agents are highlighted. In addition, International, European and French standards related to containment laboratory planning, operation or biosafety equipment are described to clarify optimal biosafety and biosecurity requirements.","Pastorino, Boris; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Charrel, Rémi",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5449436/,369
4014,A Competency Framework for Developing Global Laboratory Leaders,2019-08-20,"Building sustainable national health laboratory systems requires laboratory leaders who can address complex and changing demands for services and build strong collaborative networks. Global consensus on laboratory leadership competencies is critically important to ensure the harmonization of learning approaches for curriculum development across relevant health sectors. The World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) have partnered to develop a Laboratory Leadership Competency Framework (CF) that provides a foundation for the Global Laboratory Leadership Programme (GLLP). The CF represents the first global consensus from multiple disciplines on laboratory leadership competencies and provides structure for the development of laboratory leaders with the knowledge, skills and abilities to build bridges, enhance communication, foster collaboration and develop an understanding of existing synergies between the human, animal, environmental, and other relevant health sectors.","Albetkova, Adilya; Chaignat, Evelyne; Gasquet, Philippe; Heilmann, Martin; Isadore, Jocelyn; Jasir, Aftab; Martin, Barbara; Wilcke, Burton",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6710318/,369

Data suggest that emerging resistance to commonly prescribed antibacterials, such as macrolides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, is beginning to impact the treatment of these infections, which include acute otitis media, tonsillitis/pharyngitis and community-acquired pneumonia. There is, therefore, a need for additional agents that are active against common respiratory tract pathogens, including resistant strains and are suitable for use in children. Infection control measures to curb the clonal spread of antibacterial resistance are also extremely important.","Cunha, B. A.",Infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100129/,369

Many species groups and unplaced species of heroines are still left without a generic name following the revision of the genus Cichlasoma. We describe here the ‘Cichlasoma’ facetum group as a new genus, Australoheros, and provide evidence for its monophyly based on phylogenetic analyses of morphological and mtDNA characters. Australoheros is morphologically characterized by the lowest values in meristic characters among heroines and by three apomorphic characters in coloration pattern. In addition to the three described species of Australoheros, our results of species delimitation based on a combination of tree‐ and character‐based approaches identify seven putatively new species of Australoheros. Several coding schemes of morphological characters are used to recover the intrageneric relationships within the genus, resulting in very similar topologies. Discovery of additional species within the genus is expected once material from the whole distribution area is studied.","Říčan, O.; Kullander, S.

13160,"Television exposure is related to fear of avian flu, an Ecological Study across 23 member states of the European Union",2009-05-18,"BACKGROUND: Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) is a reaction of the pulmonary vasculature upon hypoxia, diverting blood flow into ventilated areas to preserve oxygenation. It is impaired in endotoxemia or ARDS. Voltage gated potassium channels have been shown to play a key role in the regulation of HPV. The aim of the study was to identify a voltage gated potassium channel involved in dysregulated HPV during endotoxemia. METHODS: Lungs of male C57BL/6 mice with and without endotoxemia (n = 6 ea. group) were analyzed for Kv3.4 gene and protein expression. HPV was examined in isolated perfused lungs of mice with and without endotoxemia and with and without selective Kv3.4 blocker BDS-I (n = 7 ea. group). Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pressure-flow curves were measured during normoxic (FiO(2) 0.21) and hypoxic (FiO(2) 0.01) ventilation. HPV was quantified as the increase in perfusion pressure in response to hypoxia in percent of baseline perfusion pressure (ΔPAP) in the presence and absence of BDS-I. RESULTS: Kv3.4 gene (3.2 ± 0.5-fold, p < 0.05) and protein (1.5 ± 0.1-fold p < 0.05) expression levels were increased in endotoxemic mouse lungs. Endotoxemia reduced HPV (∆PAP control: 121.2 ± 8.7% vs. LPS 19.5 ± 8.0%, means ± SEM) while inhibition of Kv3.4 with 50 nM BDS-I augmented HPV in endotoxemic but not in control lungs (∆PAP control BDS-I: 116.6 ± 16.0% vs. LPS BDS-I 84.4 ± 18.2%, means ± SEM). CONCLUSIONS: Kv3.4 gene and protein expressions are increased in endotoxemic mouse lungs. Selective inhibition of Kv3.4 augments HPV in lungs of endotoxemic mice, but not in lungs of control mice.","Turzo, Maurizio; Metzger, Karin; Lasitschka, Felix; Weigand, Markus A.; Busch, Cornelius J.",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543677/,369

19259,The Role of African Nurse Diaspora in Addressing Public Health Priorities in Africa,2021-07-12,"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in children globally, and thus suitable vaccines are desired. Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 µg/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.

20269,Editorial: Prevention in Acute Leukemias in Children,2021-08-09,"Despite its relevance for human sexuality, literature on potential effects of ejaculation frequency and masturbation on general and mental health outcomes is sparse. Reasons for this knowledge gap include a general lack of interest, but also methodological challenges and still existing superstition. This paper reconciles literature from various fields to extract relevant information on how ejaculation frequency effects general and mental health outcomes. Culture-bound syndromes have been reported in countries still strictly tabooing or condemning masturbation. Masturbatory guilt describes a phenomenon in individuals experiencing a discrepancy between moral standards and own behavior with respect to masturbation. Abstinence is one aspect under study in the area of fertility treatment. Specific time frames and their respective implications on quality of sperm remain inconclusive. Limited temporal resolution capacities hamper the precise study of brain structures directly activated during ejaculation. The relation between ejaculation frequency and hormonal influences remains poorly understood. Future research that specifically addresses ejaculation frequency and potential mental and general health outcomes is needed. In contrast to extracting knowledge as a byproduct from other studies with a different focus, this enables sound study designs and could provide evidence-based results which could then be further discussed and interpreted.","Mascherek, Anna; Reidick, Mirjam Christina; Gallinat, Jürgen; Kühn, Simone",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8382266/,369
20504,Utilization of Antibacterial Nanoparticles in Photocurable Additive Manufacturing of Advanced Composites for Improved Public Health,2021-08-06,"Vitamin D deficiency is a global problem with many health consequences, and it is currently recommended to supplement vitamin D. Change of diet should also be considered to ensure adequate vitamin D in the human body. The aim of this study was to assess the concentration of vitamin D metabolites in two different groups: one group on the low-carbohydrate-high-fat (LCHF) diet and the other group on the Eastern European (EE) diet. In the first stage, 817 participants declaring traditional EE diet or LCHF diet were investigated. Nutrition (self-reported 3-day estimated food record) and basic anthropometric parameters were assessed. After extra screening, 67 participants on the EE diet and 41 on the LCHF diet were qualified for the second stage. Plasma 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D(3)) and (25(OH)D(2)) concentration was measured by the validated HPLC—MS/MS method. Plasma 25(OH)D(3) concentration was significantly higher in the group on the LCHF diet (34.9 ± 15.9 ng/mL) than in the group on the EE diet (22.6 ± 12.1 ng/mL). No statistical differences were observed in plasma 25(OH)D(2) concentration between the study groups (p > 0.05). Women had a higher plasma 25(OH)D(2) concentration than men regardless of diet type. The LCHF diet had a positive influence on plasma vitamin D concentration. However, long-term use of the LCHF diet remains contentious due to the high risk of cardiovascular disease. This study confirmed that the type of diet influences the concentration of vitamin D metabolites in the plasma.","Bolesławska, Izabela; Kowalówka, Magdalena; Dobrzyńska, Małgorzata; Karaźniewicz-Łada, Marta; Przysławski, Juliusz",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8400948/,369

20648,Closing the Gap:: Public Libraries and Public Health,2020-09-28,"BACKGROUND: The issuing of regulation schemes and the expanding health insurance coverage for virtual visits of internet hospitals would incentivize Chinese providers and patients to use virtual visits tremendously. China’s internet hospitals vary in sponsorship. However, little is known about patients’ intention to use virtual visits delivered by different sponsorship types of internet hospitals. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research is to examine patients’ intention to use virtual visits, as well as virtual visits delivered by different sponsorship types of internet hospitals. In addition, we will identify determinants of patients’ intention to use virtual visits, as well as intention to use virtual visits delivered by different sponsorship types of internet hospitals. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 1653 participants was conducted in 3-tier hospitals in 3 cities with different income levels in May and June 2019. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors that affect patients’ intention to use virtual visits. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the determinants of the intention to use virtual visits delivered by different sponsorship types of internet hospitals (ie, enterprise-sponsored, hospital-sponsored, and government-sponsored). RESULTS: A total of 76.64% (1145/1494) of adult participants were online medical information seekers, and 87.06% (969/1113) of online medical information seekers had intention to use virtual visits. Public hospital–sponsored internet hospitals were the most prevalent ones among Chinese patients (473/894, 52.9%), followed by the provincial government internet hospital platform (238/894, 26.6%), digital health companies (116/894, 13.0%), medical e-commerce companies (48/894, 5.4%), private hospitals (13/894, 1.5%), and other companies (6/894, 0.7%). Gender, education, monthly income, and consumer type were significantly associated with the intention to use virtual visits. Gender, age, education, city income level, consumer type, and trust in the sponsor of a health website were significantly associated with the patient’s intention to use virtual visits delivered by 3 different sponsorship types of internet hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese patients who were online medical information seekers had high intention to use virtual visits and had different intentions to use virtual visits delivered by different sponsorship types of internet hospitals. Public hospitals, the government, and digital health companies were the top 3 sponsorship types of internet hospitals that patients had intention to use. Trust in a health website sponsor significantly influenced the patient’s intention to use virtual visits delivered by different sponsorship types of internet hospitals. Gender, education, and consumer type were the factors significantly associated with both the intention to use virtual visits and the intention to use virtual visits delivered by different sponsorship types of internet hospitals.","Liu, Liyun; Shi, Lizheng",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8398707/,369
20650,Libraries as Public Health Partners in Times of Crisis,2020-09-28,"BACKGROUND: Risk governance involves processes and mechanisms to understand how risk decisions are taken and executed. This concept has gained a reputation over time as being essential for emerging comprehensive management that defines the success of an organization. While guiding documents that explain the use of risk management related to nuclear safety and security are available worldwide, few locally conducted studies have explained risk governance practices in areas where hazard usage is known, such as in radiological emergencies. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes a protocol that was used to determine several factors that influence emergency responders’ perceptions toward radiological risk practices and visualize the risk radiological framework for emergency preparedness and response. METHODS: A mixed methods study with a convergent design was performed. A qualitative analysis was performed using a case study approach where 6 key informants were purposely sampled for in-depth interview, and a cross-sectional study involving a self-administered questionnaire was conducted among approximately 260 emergency respondents from national regulatory, research, and services organizations. NVivo (version 12, QSR International) was used to analyze the interview transcripts and emerging themes were identified through abductive coding. Simultaneously, multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine significant predictors that form the equation model. RESULTS: The study is still underway. Qualitative findings were based on transcript-coding that informed the relevant thematic analysis, while statistical analyses including multiple logistic regression analysis measured the adjusted odds ratio of significant variables for the equation model. The study is expected to conclude in late 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Important emerging themes and significant factors that are related to the emergency responders’ perceptions regarding radiological governance practices were determined through the convergent design. This potentially facilitated the development of a plausible radiological risk governance framework. Furthermore, our results will provide key insights that can be used in future studies.

24612,A New Method of Differentiation Between a Biological Attack and Other Epidemics,2012-08-31,"Pulmonary infections have always been a cause of high morbidity and mortality, particularly in the pediatric and geriatric population and in immunocompromised hosts [1]. Pulmonary infections have various etiologies and have variegated patterns on radiographs and computed tomography (CT). Imaging plays an important role in the initial diagnosis and follow-up of various lung infections. Radiographs can be normal or non-specific during the initial evaluation, and CT findings may be more definitive. CT not only helps with the diagnosis but can also aid in management by guiding the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. The pulmonary infections spread by direct or indirect contact with the infected host, droplet transmission, or an airborne spread. In rare cases, some infections can also be transmitted by vectors, namely, insect or animal hosts, and rarely by direct invasion from nearby infected organs. Pulmonary infections may have typical imaging patterns and distribution based on the mode of spread. There are a number of well-described imaging patterns of alveolar infections. The localization and morphological features on imaging may help in the diagnosis of infection and identification of mode of infection and, in certain cases, the microorganism responsible for the infection.","Singh, Dinesh",Thoracic Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120992/,369

26414,The Current Bioweapons Threat,2012-08-31,"The structural features of airways in patients with COPD are airway wall inflammation, fibrosis, muscle hypertrophy, and goblet cell metaplasia. These structural cellular changes contribute to mucus hypersecretion and destruction of the alveolar walls and a decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)). At the cellular level, macrophages, T lymphocytes, and neutrophils, driven by cytokines including interleukin-8 (IL-8), gather on the airways. The main cause of COPD inflammation is cigarette smoke. Smoke causes an increase in the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) and neutrophilic elastase from epithelial cells and neutrophils, which are responsible for mucin production and destruction of the lung. Initially, cigarette smoke influences the expression of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the intracellularly located nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), and receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) on lung epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and leukocytes in the lung. These actions bring about the production of cytokines and activation of inflammatory cells, leading to production of MMPs and neutrophilic elastase. The inflammatory changes persist for several months and years after smoking cessation and are sometimes irreversible. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from dying cells after cigarette smoking increase the number of apoptotic cells, suppress efferocytosis, induce hypoxia and oxidative stress, and prolong the inflammatory changes, even after smoking cessation. Viral and bacterial infections of the respiratory tract then fortify these inflammatory responses. Exacerbations of COPD then worsen the deterioration of COPD.","Kato, Akane; Hanaoka, Masayuki",Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123312/,369

Photogrammetry combined with scanning are the most appropriate techniques to monitor the evolution of microcrack networks in the cornice overhanging the paintings and preserved as a witness to 19th century additions. However, the application of these techniques was challenged due to the given constraints of a working height of 4 m and the required accuracy of a tenth of a millimetre. A special effort was therefore necessary to ensure sufficient stability of the acquisition protocol and to make it relevant during the four measurement campaigns planned over the two years of the project. The analysis of photogrammetric data has made it possible to document certain macro-deformations of the cornice according to the seasons of the year. The microcracks could be visualized and monitored from transformed 3D models of each segment for the different campaigns.

38807,Double down on prevention: Open letter to Matt Hancock on the future of public health,2020-09-07,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART), the life span of persons with HIV (PWH) has been nearly normalized. With aging, prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), including hypertension, has increased in the HIV population and exceeds that in the general population in some studies. This is due to a combination of traditional risk factors in addition to the effects attributable to the virus and ART. We review recent findings on the mechanisms contributing to MetS and hypertension in PWH, particularly those specific to the viral infection and to ART. RECENT FINDINGS: Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and chronic immune activation contribute to the development of MetS and hypertension in PWH. HIV proteins and some ART agents alter adipocyte health contributing to dyslipidemias, weight gain, and insulin resistance. HIV infection also contributes to hypertension by direct effects on the RAAS that intertwine with inflammation by the RAAS also contributing to T cell activation. SUMMARY: Recent data suggest that in addition to current ART, therapeutic targeting of the MetS and hypertension in PWH, by interfering with the RAAS, treating insulin resistance directly or by use of immunomodulators that dampen inflammation, may be critical for preventing or treating these risk factors and to improve overall cardiovascular complications in the HIV-infected aging population.","Masenga, Sepiso K.; Elijovich, Fernando; Koethe, John R.; Hamooya, Benson M.; Heimburger, Douglas C.; Munsaka, Sody M.; Laffer, Cheryl L.; Kirabo, Annet",Curr Hypertens Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7467859/,369

In order to improve the level of ideological and political education in universities and accelerate the popularization of ideological and political education, an integrated model of ideological and political education in universities based on multivariate data analysis is proposed. Taking the development of ideological and political education as the basic goal, while analysing the inevitable requirements of the integration model, the main classification criteria of the ideological and political education research objects are clarified, and the research on the education integration model is completed. College education. On this basis, the principle of integration processing is proposed, and various data attributes of ideological and political education in colleges and universities are defined. Then, combined with the mapping conditions under the integration mode, a comprehensive environment of ideological and political education based on multivariate data analysis is established. With the aim of grafting the ideological and political education model, we explore the development methods of ideological and political education in colleges and universities, determine the implementation law of ideological and political education for continuous and harmonious development, and propose constructive methods to develop the integrated model of ideological and political education in colleges and universities.","Li, Zhu-zhu; Cen, Ming-jun","e-Learning, e-Education, and Online Training",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971923/,369
47462,Counting Numbers,2021-03-18,"Human behavior or motion is diverse and complex. In order to design a robot with better sensitivity and better performance, it is necessary to set up multiple control nodes to facilitate the control robot to imitate the trajectory of human motion. However, due to the traditional robot behavior learning method, the control nodes are relatively single, and there is no clear behavior target node for the reference object, which leads to a large deviation in the robot behavior learning trajectory. Therefore, a fuzzy neural network-based Multi-agent robot behavior learning method. This method is based on the fuzzy neural network to control the behavior of robot. By optimizing the learning parameters of robot behavior, it can enhance the search program of behavior learning. According to the multi-level robot behavior learning model, it can identify the master-slave target of reference object and realize a more accurate multi-agent robot behavior learning method. The test results show that compared with the traditional method, the behavior trajectory of the proposed method is basically consistent with the behavior trajectory of the reference object. It can be seen that the method has better performance and meets the research requirements at the current stage.","Wang, Jun-ru","e-Learning, e-Education, and Online Training",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971942/,369

57197,In this Issue,2020-09-28,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the adverse events (AEs) related to the use of off-label drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out using available data pertaining to off-label drug were sourced from U.S. FDA spontaneous adverse drug reaction reporting database (FAERS) and Korea Adverse Event Reporting System database (KIDS-KD) for the years 2014 to 2018. The number and frequencies of AE cases were calculated. Disproportionality was analyzed using the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the information component (IC), and the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) methods. RESULTS: The reported AEs associated with off-label drug use were more common among older patients compared with younger patients. Gastric nonspecific symptoms and therapeutic procedure (4.16–4.57%) and haemorrage term (4.16–5.29%) were the most common AE symptoms and antithrombotic agents and immunosuppressants were the drugs most commonly reported to cause AEs in FAERS. Secondary term events (43.45–48.62%) including inappropriate schedule of drug administration and medication error were the most common AEs, and immunosuppressants and antipsychotics were the most common AE-related drugs from KIDS-KD. The numbers of reported AEs in new drug categories such as other antineoplastic agents trended to increase from 2014 to 2018 in both datasets. CONCLUSION: The numbers of reported AEs with off-label drug increased annually. AEs associated with off-label drugs may have a significant impact on older patients. Healthcare experts should be concerned about prescriptions of off-label drugs, especially anticoagulants and newly developed drugs such as immunosuppressants and antineoplastic agents.","Han, Nayoung; Oh, Jung Mi; Kim, In-Wha",Ther Clin Risk Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8387311/,369

We use a new estimator, the augmented synthetic control method (ASCM), that overcomes some limits of the standard synthetic control method (SCM). The results are twofold. From a methodological point of view, the ASCM outperforms the SCM in that the latter cannot select a valid donor set, assigning all the weights to only one country (Spain) while placing zero weights to all the remaining. From an empirical point of view, we find strong evidence of the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in avoiding losses of human lives in Italy: conservative estimates indicate that the policy saved in total more than 21,000 human lives.","Cerqueti, Roy; Coppier, Raffaella; Girardi, Alessandro; Ventura, Marco",Econom J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8499905/,369

The mean age was 24.62 years (SD = 6.3). Participants answered four instruments in addition to sociodemographic questions: Gendered Racial Microaggression Scale, Goldberg General Health Questionnaire, Group Identification Scale, and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. The results indicate that the high frequency of gendered racial microaggressions predicts worse levels of mental health and self-esteem. Self-esteem mediates the relationship between microaggressions and general health. It is a protective factor of mental health. Identity moderates this relationship, so that a high identification as a black woman is related to lower levels of mental health when faced with a high frequency of discriminatory events.

Complexity-informed approaches have the potential to offer health and social care a new paradigm for understanding, designing, implementing and evaluating solutions, yet so far has failed to gain the traction anticipated some years ago. There is a growing need for high quality syntheses of the existing knowledge base in this area and given the diversity of theory and approaches, a scoping review is the best approach to curate this knowledge. METHODS A scoping review of relevant literature from January 2000 to present, using the refined Arksey and O'Malley six-stage framework will be conducted.

An initial search of databases will be undertaken to identify key search terms followed by an analysis of retrieved papers title and abstract text words, and of index terms used to describe the articles. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Third, the reference lists of identified reports and articles will be searched. Authors of primary articles will be contacted and a search for grey material performed. Finally, a complete search strategy of one major database will be included. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION As this is a scoping review, ethical approval is not required.

Major depression in type 2 diabetes is associated with decreased adherence to self-care behaviors. The association between subthreshold depression and self-care behaviors, however, has not previously been systematically reviewed. The objective of this review is to determine the association between subthreshold depression and self-care behaviors. METHODS A systematic search was performed in five electronic databases that included MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Emcare, and CINAHL. Any observational studies in adults with type 2 diabetes, investigating the association between subthreshold depression and any self-care behaviors, were included in the review. Qualitative studies, review articles, and gray literature were excluded. Two reviewers independently completed the title and abstract and full-text screening, appraised the study quality, and extracted the data. A third reviewer resolved any discrepancies between the reviewers if needed. Included articles were critically appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist. Meta-analyses were not conducted because criteria for conducting such analyses were not met. RESULTS A total of 6408 articles were identified through the database searching. After the abstract and full-text review, two articles met the inclusion criteria. One of the included study was cross-sectional while the other was a longitudinal study. Both studies showed inconsistent findings in the association between subthreshold depression and self-care behaviors. Important risks of bias were identified in the included studies. DISCUSSION The evidence from the two included studies on a possible association between subthreshold depression and self-care behaviors in adults with type 2 diabetes was not consistent and potentially biased. Our review established a gap in knowledge and suggests that further high-quality studies are needed to examine the association between subthreshold depression and self-care behaviors in people with type 2 diabetes.

The model describes the anisotropy of the velocity of compressional and shear bulk elastic waves. We propose to achieve this with ultrasound imaging relying on the transmission of unfocused beams and with an autofocus method. The latter is based on the principle that the reconstructed ultrasound image shows optimal quality if the velocity model is correct. The autofocus approach is applied to a composite image of the interface between cortical bone and marrow. It is obtained by incoherent summation of 4 types of images exploiting 4 different ray paths in the cortical bone layer, 3 of them involving mode-converted shear waves. If the parameters of the model are correct, spatial co-localization of the interface appears in the four images. As a result, intensity and sharpness in the composite image are maximal. The five parameters of the model of transverse isotropy are successfully estimated in a tube made of a bone-mimicking material. The estimates are in good agreement with resonant ultrasound spectroscopy measurements. The tube thickness is recovered with an error smaller than 0.3%.In vivoresults at the forearm of a volunteer are promising, four parameters could be estimated and are in good agreement withex vivoresonant ultrasound spectroscopy measurements. Moreover X-ray peripheral computed tomography corroborates the thickness of the cortical bone layer in the ultrasound image. Weak-anisotropy and exact transverse isotropy models provide very close measurements of the thickness of the tube and the radius bone. Thus, we recommend using the model of weak transverse isotropy for real-time anatomical imaging because more computationally efficient. For material characterization however, the model of exact transverse isotropy is preferred because the elastic anisotropy of cortical bone is moderate, rather than weak.","Renaud, Guillaume; Clouzet, Pierre; Cassereau, Didier; Talmant, Maryline",Physics in medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/abb92c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937604/,369

After its discovery in 1997, the 10-23 Dz (which can cleave RNA efficiently and site-specifically, has flexible design, is independent from cell mechanisms, does not require expensive chemical modifications for effective use in vivo) has been employed to downregulate a range of therapeutically important genes. Recently, 10-23 Dzs have taken their first steps into clinical trials. AREAS COVERED This review focuses predominantly on Dz applications as potential antiviral, antibacterial, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory agents as well as for the treatment of cardiovascular disease and diseases of CNS, summarizing results of their clinical trials up to the present day. EXPERT OPINION In comparison with antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNAs, Dzs do not usually show off-target effects due to their high specificity and lack of immunogenicity in vivo. As more results of clinical trials carried out so far are gradually becoming available, Dzs may turn out to be safe and well-tolerated therapeutics in humans. Therefore, there is a good chance that we may witness a deoxyribozyme drug reaching the clinic in the near future.","Fokina, Alesya A; Stetsenko, Dmitry A; François, Jean-Christophe",Expert opinion on biological therapy,https://doi.org/10.1517/14712598.2015.1025048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25772532/,369

Mushroom is a macrofungus which has been cultivated worldwide for its nutritional value and medicinal applications. Several bioactive molecules were extracted from mushroom such as polysaccharides, lectins and terpenoids. Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins with non-immunologic origin. Lectins were classified according to their structure, origin and sugar specificity. This protein has different binding specificity with surface glycan moiety which determines its activity and therapeutic applications. A wide range of medicinal activities such as antitumor, antiviral, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and antidiabetic were reported from sugar-binding proteins. However, glycan-binding protein from mushroom is not well explored as antiviral agent. The discovery of novel antiviral agents is a public health emergency to overcome the current pandemic and be ready for the upcoming viral pandemics. The mechanism of action of lectin against viruses targets numerous steps in viral life cycle such as viral attachment, entry and replication.

81938,Leading the World Again: Creating a 21st-Century Public Health Agency.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Neurosurgical procedures are life- and function-saving but carry a risk of adverse events (AE) which can cause permanent neurologic deficits. Unfortunately, there is lack of clearly defined AEs associated with given procedures, and their reporting is non-uniform and often arbitrary. However, with an increasing number of neurosurgical procedures performed, there is a need for standardization of AEs for systematic tracking. Such a system would establish a baseline for future quality improvement strategies. OBJECTIVE To review our institutional AEs and devise standardized titles specific to the spine, tumor, functional, and vascular neurosurgery divisions. METHODS A review of prospective monthly-reported morbidity and mortality (M&M) conference data within the Department of Neurological Surgery was conducted from January 2017 to December 2019. An AE was defined as any mortality, an ""unintended and undesirable diagnostic or therapeutic event"", ""an event that prolongs the patient's hospital stay"", or an outcome with permanent or transient neurologic deficit. RESULTS A total of 1096 AEs from 7418 total procedures (14.8 %) were identified. Of those, 418 (5.6 %) were in cerebrovascular, 249 (3.4 %) were in neuro-oncology and 429 (5.8 %) were in the spine & functional divisions. The most common AEs across all divisions were infection (17 %), hemorrhage (11 %) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak (7.8 %). Other AEs were indirectly related to the neurosurgical procedure, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (2.7 %), or pneumothorax (0.3 %). CONCLUSION This work illustrates standardized AEs can be implemented universally across the spectrum of neurological surgery. Standardization can help identify recurring AE patterns through better tracking.","Al Saiegh, Fadi; Mazza, Jacob; Hafazalla, Karim; Baldassari, Michael P; Theofanis, Thana; Ye, Donald; Hoelscher, Christian; Harrop, James S; Evans, James J; Jabbour, Pascal; Rosenwasser, Robert H; Sharan, Ashwini D",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2020.106121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818755/,369

Public health measures to control the virus's rapid spread, such as physical distancing, social isolation, lockdown, restricted movements, and quarantine, caused fear and panic in the general population. Although pandemic-related stressors have been reported, changes that occur during the perinatal period compounded by those made to obstetric care guidelines may put pregnant and postpartum mothers at increased risk of poor mental health. While an abundance of research exists in developed nations such as Europe and America, examining the impact of the pandemic on maternal mental health, very few studies have investigated the same in the African continent. Considering that poor maternal mental health has lifelong adverse consequences not only on the mothers but on the family and society and given that the African region has prominently weak health systems, high poverty rates, and unreliable maternal care, it is expected that the burden of the pandemic on maternal mental health will be more pronounced in Africa than in other regions. As such, multipronged mental health interventions and strategies that consider the heterogeneity within and between the African region must be developed.

METHODS Twelve saphenous veins in six goats were treated with one of the three treatment modalities: four veins with RFA, four with EVLA, four with SVS. Seven days after treatment occlusion and diameter changes were evaluated by ultrasound imaging and histological changes were examined microscopically. RESULTS Vein length, mean diameter, and the amount of tumescence was comparable between the three groups. Histological examination showed extensive vein wall destruction, the least in the outer layer of the vein wall. The total vein wall damage was 9.2/15 (SD 3.5) for EVLA, 13.3/15 (SD 3.3) for RFA, and 11.2/15 (SD 2.8) for SVS group. There was no significant difference among the three groups. Perivenous tissue damage was low. No extrafascial damage was seen. CONCLUSION Histological findings after steam ablation are similar to the RFA and EVLA with a low perivenous tissue destruction score and a high vein wall destruction score.","Thomis, S; Verbrugghe, P; Milleret, R; Verbeken, E; Fourneau, I; Herijgers, P",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejvs.2013.06.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23835108/,369
94194,"Nonrelocatable Occupations at Increased Risk During Pandemics: United States, 2018.",2020-06-18,"OBJECTIVE Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for lung perfusion imaging is attracting considerable interest in intensive care, as it might open up entirely new ways to adjust ventilation therapy. A promising technique is bolus injection of a conductive indicator to the central venous catheter, which yields the indicator-based signal (IBS). Lung perfusion images are then typically obtained from the IBS using the maximum slope technique. However, the low spatial resolution of EIT results in a partial volume effect (PVE), which requires further processing to avoid regional bias. APPROACH In this work, we repose the extraction of lung perfusion images from the IBS as a source separation problem to account for the PVE. We then propose a model-based algorithm, called gamma decomposition (GD), to derive an efficient solution. The GD algorithm uses a signal model to transform the IBS into a parameter space where the source signals of heart and lung are separable by clustering in space and time. Subsequently, it reconstructs lung model signals from which lung perfusion images are unambiguously extracted. MAIN RESULTS We evaluate the GD algorithm on EIT data of a prospective animal trial with eight pigs. The results show that it enables lung perfusion imaging using EIT at different stages of regional impairment. Furthermore, parameters of the source signals seem to represent physiological properties of the cardio-pulmonary system. SIGNIFICANCE This work represents an important advance in IBS processing that will likely reduce bias of EIT perfusion images and thus eventually enable imaging of regional ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratio.","Hentze, Benjamin; Muders, Thomas; Hoog Antink, Christoph; Putensen, Christian; Larsson, Anders; Hedenstierna, Göran; Walter, Marian; Leonhardt, Steffen",Physiological measurement,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/ac0e84; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34167091/,369

97972,Contagion: epidemiological models and financial crises.,2014,"INTRODUCTION The use of GnRH agonist (GnRHa) for final oocyte maturation trigger in oocyte donation and elective frozen embryo transfer cycles is well established due to lower ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) rates as compared to hCG trigger. A recent Cochrane meta-analysis concluded that GnRHa trigger was associated with reduced live birth rates (LBRs) in fresh autologous IVF cycles compared to hCG trigger. However, the evidence is not unequivocal, and recent trials have found encouraging reproductive outcomes among couples undergoing GnRHa trigger and individualized luteal LH activity support. Thus, the aim was to compare GnRHa trigger followed by luteal LH activity support with hCG trigger in IVF patients undergoing fresh embryo transfer. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials published until December 14, 2016. The population was infertile patients submitted to IVF/ICSI cycles with GnRH antagonist cotreatment who underwent fresh embryo transfer. The intervention was GnRHa trigger followed by LH activity luteal phase support (LPS). The comparator was hCG trigger followed by a standard LPS. The critical outcome measures were LBR and OHSS rate. The secondary outcome measures were number of oocytes retrieved, clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates, and miscarriage rates. RESULTS A total of five studies met the selection criteria comprising a total of 859 patients. The LBR was not significantly different between the GnRHa and hCG trigger groups (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62, 1.14). OHSS was reported in a total of 4/413 cases in the GnRHa group compared to 7/413 in the hCG group (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.15, 1.60). We observed a slight, but non-significant increase in miscarriage rate in the GnRHa triggered group compared to the hCG group (OR 1.85; 95% CI 0.97, 3.54). CONCLUSION GnRHa trigger with LH activity LPS resulted in comparable LBRs compared to hCG trigger. The most recent trials reported LBRs close to unity indicating that individualization of the LH activity LPS improved the luteal phase deficiency reported in the first GnRHa trigger studies. However, LPS optimization is needed to further limit OHSS in the subgroup of normoresponder patients (<14 follicles ≥ 11 mm).

98164,The inextricable link between public health and human rights and threats to progression in far-right populism and neoliberal systems.,2021-06-28,"OBJECTIVES Infection control policies and guidelines recommend using facemasks and respirators to protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from respiratory infections. Common types of respirators used in healthcare settings are filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). Aims of this study were to examine the current attitudes and practices of HCWs regarding the selection and use of respiratory protection and determine the acceptability of a novel PAPR. METHODS In-depth interviews were undertaken with 20 HCWs from a large tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia. Participants were fit tested with a lightweight tight-fitting half-facepiece PAPR (CleanSpace2™ Power Unit, PAF-0034, by CleanSpace Technology®) using the TSI™ Portacount quantitative fit test method. RESULTS Interview results showed that HCWs had a limited role in the selection and use of facemasks and respirators and had been using the devices provided by the hospital. The majority of subjects had no knowledge of hospital policy for the use of facemasks and respirators, had not been trained on the use of respirators, and had not been fit tested previously. Compliance with the use of facemasks and respirators was perceived as being low and facemasks and respirators were typically used only for short periods of time.All 20 participants were successfully fit tested to the CleanSpace2™ PAPR (overall geometric mean fit factor-6768). According to the exit surveys, CleanSpace2™ PAPRs were easy to don (14/20) and doff (15/20) and comfortable to wear (14/20). Most participants believed that PAPRs provide higher protection, comfort and reusability over N95 FFR and can be used during pandemics and other high-risk situations. CONCLUSIONS HCWs should be aware of infection control policies and training should be provided on the correct use of respiratory protective devices. PAPRs can be used in hospital settings to protect HCWs from certain highly infectious and emerging pathogens, however, HCWs require adequate training on storage, use, and cleaning of PAPRs.","Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Seale, Holly; Rawlinson, William D; Kunasekaran, Mohana; Macintyre, C Raina",Annals of work exposures and health,https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxaa020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32144412/,369
98382,Climate Change Is Already Exacerbating Current Social Inequities.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND A country's health system faces pressure when hit by an unexpected shock, such as what we observe in the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The concept of resilience is highly relevant in this context and is a prerequisite for a health system capable of withstanding future shocks. By exploring how the key dimensions of the resilient health system framework are applied, the present systematic review synthesizes the vital features of resilient health systems in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this review is to ascertain the relevance of health system resilience in the context of a major shock, through better understanding its dimensions, uses and implications. METHODS The review uses the best-fit framework synthesis approach. An a priori conceptual framework was selected and a coding framework created. A systematic search identified 4284 unique citations from electronic databases and reports by non-governmental organisations, 12 of which met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted and coded against the pre-existing themes. Themes outside of the a priori framework were collated to form a refined list of themes. Then, all twelve studies were revisited using the new list of themes in the context of each study. RESULTS Ten themes were generated from the analysis. Five confirmed the a priori conceptual framework that capture the dynamic attributes of a resilient system. Five new themes were identified as foundational for achieving resilience: realigned relationships, foresight and motivation as drivers, and emergency preparedness and change management as organisational mechanisms. CONCLUSION The refined conceptual model shows how the themes inter-connect. The foundations of resilience appear to be critical especially in resource-constrained settings to unlock the dynamic attributes of resilience. This review prompts countries to consider building the foundations of resilience described here as a priority to better prepare for future shocks.","Grimm, Pauline Yongeun; Oliver, Sandy; Merten, Sonja; Han, Wai Wai; Wyss, Kaspar",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619924/,369

We sought to evaluate the demographic and clinical characteristics of cerebral venous thrombosis among patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at 6 tertiary care centers in the New York City metropolitan area. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study of 13,500 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized between March 1 and May 30, 2020. RESULTS Of 13,500 patients with COVID-19, twelve had imaging-proved cerebral venous thrombosis with an incidence of 8.8 per 10,000 during 3 months, which is considerably higher than the reported incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis in the general population of 5 per million annually. There was a male preponderance (8 men, 4 women) and an average age of 49 years (95% CI, 36-62 years; range, 17-95 years). Only 1 patient (8%) had a history of thromboembolic disease. Neurologic symptoms secondary to cerebral venous thrombosis occurred within 24 hours of the onset of the respiratory and constitutional symptoms in 58% of cases, and 75% had venous infarction, hemorrhage, or both on brain imaging. Management consisted of anticoagulation, endovascular thrombectomy, and surgical hematoma evacuation. The mortality rate was 25%. CONCLUSIONS Early evidence suggests a higher-than-expected frequency of cerebral venous thrombosis among patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Cerebral venous thrombosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of neurologic syndromes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Al-Mufti, F; Amuluru, K; Sahni, R; Bekelis, K; Karimi, R; Ogulnick, J; Cooper, J; Overby, P; Nuoman, R; Tiwari, A; Berekashvili, K; Dangayach, N; Liang, J; Gupta, G; Khandelwal, P; Dominguez, J F; Sursal, T; Kamal, H; Dakay, K; Taylor, B; Gulko, E; El-Ghanem, M; Mayer, S A; Gandhi, C",AJNR.

100075,Future perfect? Improving preparedness through the experiences of the influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic.,2011,"As part of its Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer, Covidien, to provide clinical and economic evidence for the evaluation of the Pipeline™ embolization device (PED) for the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms. Cedar; a consortium between Cardiff and Vale University Health Board and Cardiff University, was commissioned to act as an External Assessment Centre (EAC) for NICE to independently critique the manufacturers' submissions. This article gives an overview of the evidence provided, the findings of the EAC and the final guidance published by NICE. The scope issued by NICE considered PED as the intervention in a patient population with complex unruptured intracranial aneurysms (IAs), specifically large/giant, wide-necked and fusiform aneurysms. The comparator treatments identified were stent-assisted coiling, parent vessel occlusion, neurosurgical techniques and conservative management. The manufacturer claimed that PED fulfils a currently unmet clinical need in the treatment of large or giant, wide-necked or fusiform IAs. Thirteen studies were identified by the manufacturer as being relevant to the decision problem, with two of these included for data extraction. The EAC identified 16 studies as relevant, three of which had been published after the manufacturer's search. Data extraction was carried out on these studies as, although many were low level research comprising of case reports and case series, they provided useful, pertinent safety and outcome data. No relevant economic studies of the device were identified; therefore, a new economic model was designed by the manufacturer. The base-case scenario provided recognized the costs of PED to be higher than the costs for endovascular parent vessel occlusion, neurosurgical parent vessel occlusion, neurosurgical clipping and conservative management. However, PED was found to be cost saving compared with stent-assisted coiling, with a saving of £13,110 per patient. Analysis of the clinical data suggested that treatment with PED has high rates of clinical success with high rates of aneurysm occlusion and acceptable adverse events for the patient population. Economic evidence suggested that the costs in the base-case for PED may have been underestimated, meaning that PED would only become cost saving in patients who would otherwise require treatment with 32 coils or more. NICE Medical Technologies Guidance MTG10, issued in May 2012, recommends the adoption of PED in selected patients within the UK National Health Service (NHS).","Withers, Kathleen; Carolan-Rees, Grace; Dale, Megan",Applied health economics and health policy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-012-0005-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23341264/,369

We performed a comparative evaluation of two SARS vaccines for their ability to protect against live SARS-CoV intranasal challenge in ferrets. Both the whole killed SARS-CoV vaccine (with and without alum) and adenovirus-based vectors encoding the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein induced neutralizing antibody responses and reduced viral replication and shedding in the upper respiratory tract and progression of virus to the lower respiratory tract. The vaccines also diminished haemorrhage in the thymus and reduced the severity and extent of pneumonia and damage to lung epithelium. However, despite high neutralizing antibody titres, protection was incomplete for all vaccine preparations and administration routes. Our data suggest that a combination of vaccine strategies may be required for effective protection from this pathogen. The ferret may be a good model for SARS-CoV infection because it is the only model that replicates the fever seen in human patients, as well as replicating other SARS disease features including infection by the respiratory route, clinical signs, viral replication in upper and lower respiratory tract and lung damage.","See, Raymond H; Petric, Martin; Lawrence, David J; Mok, Catherine P Y; Rowe, Thomas; Zitzow, Lois A; Karunakaran, Karuna P; Voss, Thomas G; Brunham, Robert C; Gauldie, Jack; Finlay, B Brett; Roper, Rachel L",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.2008/001891-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18753223/,369

This article explores how using Haddenham easywrap instead of time- and resource-intensive bandaging regimes, alongside the Haddenham LymphFlow Advance, as part of self-management programmes, can benefit patients' quality of life, reduce costs and resource use and enable patients to self-manage this long-term chronic condition more effectively.","Everett, Jeanne; Lawrance, Sue; Phillips, Natalie",British journal of community nursing,https://doi.org/10.12968/bjcn.2021.26.sup4.s16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33797940/,369
106958,Much More Has Been Done Right Than Wrong.,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The trajectory of neurological improvement after stroke treatment is clinically likely to be an important prognostic signal. We compared the accuracy of early longitudinal National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) measurement versus other early markers of stroke severity post treatment in predicting subjects' 90-day stroke outcome. METHODS Data are from the Endovascular treatment for Small Core and Anterior circulation Proximal occlusion with ESCAPE trial (Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times). Stroke severity was assessed at baseline, 1, 2, 5, 30, and 90 days. Subjects' functional outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale at baseline, 30 days, and 90 days. Group-based trajectory model was used to identify distinct subgroups of longitudinal trajectories of NIHSS measured over the first 2, 5, and 30 days. The accuracy of baseline NIHSS, infarct volume, 24-hour change in NIHSS, infarct volume, and disease severity trajectory subgroups in predicting 90-day stroke outcome were assessed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Group-based trajectory model of the 2-day longitudinal NIHSS data revealed 3 distinct subgroups of NIHSS trajectories-large improvement (41.6%), minimal improvement (31.1%), and no improvement (27.3%) subgroups. Individuals in the large improvement group were more likely were more likely to exhibit good outcomes after 90 days than those in the minimal improvement or no improvement subgroup. Among candidate predictors, the 2-day trajectory subgroup variable was the most accurate in predicting 90-day modified Rankin Scale at 84.5%.

However, the overall safety and efficacy of these agents compared with oral or systemic therapy remains controversial. METHODS Two 12-week, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, controlled, multicenter studies compared the safety and efficacy profiles of diclofenac topical solution (TDiclo) with oral diclofenac (ODiclo). Each study independently showed that TDiclo had similar efficacy to ODiclo. To compare the safety profiles of TDiclo and ODiclo, a pooled safety analysis was performed for 927 total patients who had radiologically confirmed symptomatic OA of the knee. This pooled analysis included patients treated with TDiclo, containing 45.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and those treated with ODiclo. Safety assessments included monitoring of adverse events (AEs), recording of vital signs, dermatologic evaluation of the study knee, and clinical laboratory evaluation. RESULTS AEs occurred in 312 (67.1%) patients using TDiclo versus 298 (64.5%) of those taking ODiclo. The most common AE with TDiclo was dry skin at the application site (24.1% vs 1.9% with ODiclo; P < 0.0001). Fewer gastrointestinal (25.4% vs 39.0%; P < 0.0001) and cardiovascular (1.5% vs 3.5%; P = 0.055) AEs occurred with TDiclo compared with ODiclo. ODiclo was associated with significantly greater increases in liver enzymes and creatinine, and greater decreases in creatinine clearance and hemoglobin (P < 0.001 for all).

In preparation for a large influx of critically ill patients, operating rooms (ORs) at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP-Columbia) were converted into a novel intensive care unit area, the ORICU. METHODS 23 ORs were converted into an 82-bed ORICU. Adaptations to the OR environment permitted the delivery of standard critical care therapies. Non-intensive-care-trained staff were educated on the basics of critical care and deployed in a hybrid staffing model. Anesthesia machines were repurposed as critical care ventilators, with accommodations to ensure reliable function and patient safety. To compare ORICU survivorship to outcomes in more traditional environments, we performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of all patients cared for in the ORICU, censoring data at the time of ORICU closure. We hypothesized that age, gender, and obesity may have influenced the risk of death. Thus, we estimated hazard ratios for death using Cox proportional hazard regression models with age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) as covariables and, separately, using older age (65 years and older) adjusted for gender and BMI. RESULTS The ORICU cared for 133 patients from March 24 - May 14, 2020. Patients were transferred to the ORICU from other ICUs, inpatient wards, the Emergency Department, and other institutions. Patients remained in the ORICU until either transfer to another unit or death. As the hospital patient load decreased, patients were transferred out of the ORICU. This process was completed on May 14, 2020. At time of data censoring, 55 (41.4%) of patients had died. The estimated probability of survival 30 days after admission was 0.61 (95% CI 0.52 - 0.69). Age was significantly associated with increased risk of mortality (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.08, p < 0.001 for a 1 year increase in age). Patients who were 65 years or older were an estimated 3.17 times more likely to die than younger patients (95% CI 1.78 - 5.63, p < 0.001) when adjusting for gender and BMI. CONCLUSIONS A large number of critically ill Covid-19 patients were cared for in the ORICU, which substantially increased ICU capacity at NYP-Columbia. The estimated ORICU survival rate at 30 days was comparable to other reported rates, suggesting this was an effective approach to manage the influx of critically ill Covid-19 patients during a time of crisis.","Mittel, Aaron M; Panzer, Oliver; Wang, David S; Miller, Steven E; Schaff, Jacob E; Hastie, Maya Jalbout; Sutherland, Lauren; Brentjens, Tricia E; Sobol, Julia B; Cabredo, Almarie; Hastie, Jonathan",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000005301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33136661/,369
116766,Population-based active surveillance cohort studies for influenza: lessons from Peru.,2012,"BACKGROUND Ketamine rapidly reduces thoughts of suicide in patients with treatment-resistant depression who are at low risk for suicide. However, the extent to which ketamine reduces thoughts of suicide in depressed patients with current suicidal ideation remains unknown. METHODS Between April 2012 and October 2013, 14 outpatients with DSM-IV-diagnosed major depressive disorder were recruited for the presence of current, stable (≥ 3 months) suicidal thoughts. They received open-label ketamine infusions over 3 weeks (0.5 mg/kg over 45 minutes for the first 3 infusions; 0.75 mg/kg over 45 minutes for the last 3). In this secondary analysis, the primary outcome measures of suicidal ideation (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS] and the Suicide Item of the 28-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HDRS₂₈-SI]) were assessed at 240 minutes postinfusion and for 3 months thereafter in a naturalistic follow-up. RESULTS Over the course of the infusions (acute treatment phase), 7 of 14 patients (50%) showed remission of suicidal ideation on the C-SSRS Ideation scale (even among patients whose depression did not remit). There was a significant linear decrease in this score over time (P < .001), which approached significance even after controlling for severity of 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS₆) core depression items (P = .05). Similarly, there were significant decreases in the C-SSRS Intensity (P < .01) and HDRS₂₈-SI (P < .001) scores during the acute treatment phase. Two of the 7 patients who achieved remission during the acute treatment phase (29%) maintained their remission throughout a 3-month naturalistic follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In this preliminary study, repeated doses of open-label ketamine rapidly and robustly decreased suicidal ideation in pharmacologically treated outpatients with treatment-resistant depression with stable suicidal thoughts; this decrease was maintained for at least 3 months following the final ketamine infusion in 2 patients.

117692,The Next 10 Years of Federal Tobacco Regulation: A Road Map to Protect Public Health and Advance Health Equity.,2020,"The relative contributions of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-23 to viral pathogenesis have not been extensively studied. IL-12p40 mRNA rapidly increases after neurotropic coronavirus infection. Infection of mice defective in both IL-12 and IL-23 (p40(-/-)), in IL-12 alone (p35(-/-)), and in IL-23 alone (p19(-/-)) revealed that the symptoms of coronavirus-induced encephalitis are regulated by IL-12. IL-17-producing cells never exceeded background levels, supporting a redundant role of IL-23 in pathogenesis. Viral control, tropism, and demyelination were all similar in p35(-/-), p19(-/-), and wild-type mice. Reduced morbidity in infected IL-12 deficient mice was also not associated with altered recruitment or composition of inflammatory cells. However, gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) levels and virus-specific IFN-gamma-secreting CD4 and CD8 T cells were all reduced in the central nervous systems (CNS) of infected p35(-/-) mice. Transcription of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6, but not tumor necrosis factor, were initially reduced in infected p35(-/-) mice but increased to wild-type levels during peak inflammation. Furthermore, although transforming growth factor beta mRNA was not affected, IL-10 was increased in the CNS in the absence of IL-12. These data suggest that IL-12 does not contribute to antiviral function within the CNS but enhances morbidity associated with viral encephalitis by increasing the ratio of IFN-gamma to protective IL-10.","Kapil, Parul; Atkinson, Roscoe; Ramakrishna, Chandran; Cua, Daniel J; Bergmann, Cornelia C; Stohlman, Stephen A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00315-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19339350/,369

120894,The Physician's Duty to Treat During Pandemics.,2018,"Background: The problem of obesity in young women leads to future chronic diseases, effects on reproductive health, and next-generation obesity. Thus, it is necessary to provide effective support for these women's behavioral change. The purpose of this study was to evaluate dietary-related indicators to clarify the appetite and eating behavior problems among young women. Methods: Healthy women 18-39 years of age were enrolled. Interoceptive awareness (IA) was quantified using a heartbeat perception task score. Eating behavior was examined in three ways: Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), visual analog scales of subjective appetite sensations, and a food consumption test. Results: In all, 15 participants who were overweight and 50 with normal weight were analyzed. The overweight women were clustered into two groups according to the heartbeat perception task score: a low-score group (women with overweight who have low IA [OW-LOW]) and high-score group (women with overweight who have high IA [OW-HIGH]). The OW-LOW group had significantly smaller intermeal changes in hunger score compared with women with normal weight. The disinhibition score on the TFEQ for the OW-HIGH group was significantly higher than the normal-weight women, and the prospective consumption score in the fasting condition was significantly higher in women with normal weight and a high heartbeat perception task score. Conclusions: Overweight young women were characterized into two groups with different appetite and eating behavior, which is connected to the risk of overeating. An appetite characteristic is associated with a high risk of obesity among the normal-weight population. Individualized interventions tailored to the IA levels may help in improving and preventing obesity.","Nishimura, Akiko; Harashima, Shin-Ichi; Hosoda, Kiminori; Honda, Ikumi",Metabolic syndrome and related disorders,https://doi.org/10.1089/met.2020.0042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667840/,369

This study investigates the impact of an ambulatory oncology clinic-based GT model. METHODS From 2012 to 2021, patients with PC were prospectively enrolled and considered for GT. Two chronological cohorts were compared: (1) the preuniversal genetic testing (pre-UGT) cohort, which received GT based on clinical criteria or family history; and (2) the post-UGT cohort, where an 86-gene panel was offered to all patients with PC. RESULTS Of 847 eligible patients, 735 (86.8%) were enrolled (pre-UGT, n=579; post-UGT, n=156). A higher proportion of the post-UGT cohort received prospective GT (97.4% vs 58.5%, p<0.001). The rate of pathogenic germline alterations (PGA) across both cohorts was 9.9%, with 8.0% of PGAs in PC susceptibility genes. The post-UGT cohort had a higher prevalence of overall PGAs (17.2% vs 6.6%, p<0.001) and PGAs in PC susceptibility genes (11.9% vs 6.3%, p<0.001). The median turnaround time from enrolment to GT report was shorter in the post-UGT cohort (13 days vs 42 days, p<0.001). Probands with a PGA disclosed their GT results to 84% of their first-degree relatives (FDRs). However, only 31% of informed FDRs underwent GT, and the number of new cases per index case was 0.52. CONCLUSION A point-of-care GT model is feasible and expedites access to GT for patients with PC. Strategies to increase the uptake of cascade testing are needed to maximise the clinical impact of an oncology clinic-based GT model.","Wang, Yifan; Golesworthy, Bryn; Cuggia, Adeline; Domecq, Celine; Chaudhury, Prosanto; Barkun, Jeffrey; Metrakos, Peter; Asselah, Jamil; Bouganim, Nathaniel; Gao, Zu-Hua; Chong, George; Foulkes, William D; Zogopoulos, George",Journal of medical genetics,https://doi.org/10.1136/jmedgenet-2021-108054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34556502/,369

135449,A Public Health Informatics Solution to Improving Food Safety in Restaurants: Putting the Missing Piece in the Puzzle.,2021,"Background: Recent trials have proved the efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy over medical treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke, with the balance of equivalent rates of adverse events. Stent retrievers were applied predominantly in most trials; however, the role of other thrombectomy devices has not been well validated. A direct aspiration first-pass technique (ADAPT) is proposed to be a faster thrombectomy technique than the stent retriever technique. This meta-analysis investigated and compared the efficacy and adverse events of first-line ADAPT with those of first-line stent retrievers in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods: A structured search was conducted comprehensively. A total of 1623 papers were found, and 4 articles were included in our meta-analysis. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tools were applied to evaluate the quality of studies. The primary outcome was defined as the proportion of patients with the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia (TICI) scale of 2b/3 at the end of all procedures. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients with functional independence (modified Rankin scale of 0-2) at the third month, the proportion of patients with the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia (TICI) scale of 2b/3 by primary chosen device, and the proportion of patients who received rescue therapies. Safety outcomes were the symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) rate and the mortality rate within 3 months. Results: One randomized controlled trial, one prospective cohort study, and two retrospective cohort studies were included. No significant difference between these 2 strategies of management were observed in the primary outcome (TICI scale at the end of all procedures, odds ratio [OR] = 0.78), two secondary outcomes (functional independence at the third month, OR = 1.16; TICI scale by primary chosen device, OR = 1.25), and all safety outcomes (sICH rate, OR = 1.56; mortality rate, OR = 0.91). The proportion of patients who received rescue therapies was higher in the first-line ADAPT group (OR = 0.64). Conclusions: Among first-line thrombectomy devices for patients with ischemic stroke, ADAPT with the latest thrombosuction system was as efficient and safe as stent retrievers.","Hsieh, Kevin Li-Chun; Chuang, Kai-I; Weng, Hsu-Huei; Cheng, Sho-Jen; Chiang, Yu; Chen, Cheng-Yu",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2018.00801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30319531/,369

HISTORY Rehabilitation developed in a piecemeal way, focused on specific problems: spinal cord injury, burns, polio, stroke, back pain, equipment and adaptations etc. Rehabilitation is also provided using other names (e.g. intermediate care). Patients with complex needs do not fit easily within this system. SYSTEM FAILURE After Covid-19, patients have problems that cross existing condition-specific and/or treatment-specific services. Covid-19 has exposed the lack of any coherent organisational principle underlying development or commissioning of rehabilitation services. Consequently, in order to have their needs met, patients either have to engage with two or more separate services or they receive good management for some problems and sub-optimal management for other problems. THE GOALS The multitude of small specific services need to coalesce into an integrated service able to meet all the needs of any patient referred. Second, rehabilitation needs to be fully integrated into all healthcare services. A SOLUTION The purpose of healthcare is to 'improve our health and well-being . . . to stay as well as we can to the end of our lives'. (NHS constitution) All healthcare services need to consider patients holistically, giving equal attention to disease, disability, and distress. Rehabilitation, acute care, mental health and palliative care services need to work in parallel to achieve this purpose. Healthcare providers, supported by commissioners and rehabilitation experts, could achieve structural and organisational change, meeting the needs of patients.","Wade, Derick T",Clinical rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1177/0269215520971145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33167682/,369

This study aimed to evaluate the short-term and longterm outcomes of postinfarction ventricular septal perforation (VSP). METHODS We evaluated outcomes for VSP repair for 42 patients over 19 years. A retrospective analysis of clinical records, risk factors for hospital death, and long-term survival was performed. RESULTS In-hospital mortality was 33.3%. The most common cause of hospital death was left-sided heart failure. A low ejection fraction and short time interval from acute myocardial infarction to the onset of VSP were significant risk factors. The actuarial survival rates of in-hospital survivors at 5 and 10 years were 81.7% and 43.5%, respectively. There were 17 cardiac events among the survivors during the follow-up period. The most influential factor affecting long-term outcomes was the number of diseased coronary arteries. CONCLUSION The long-term survival outcome of VSP patients during the postoperative period was comparatively good, but the prognosis of VSP patients with multivessel disease was not satisfactory because of congestive heart failure or ventricular arrhythmia. We believe that postoperative medical treatment for preventing cardiac remodeling is important for improving long-term survival outcomes in such patients.","Noguchi, Kenichiro; Yamaguchi, Atsushi; Naito, Kazuhiro; Yuri, Kouichi; Adachi, Hideo",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11748-011-0882-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22453534/,369

140488,Viewing the US presidential electoral map through the lens of public health.,2021,"GPAT, the rate-limiting enzyme in triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, plays an important role in seed oil accumulation. In this study, two AhGPAT9 genes were individually cloned from the A- and B- genomes of peanut, which shared a similarity of 95.65%, with 165 site differences. The overexpression of AhGPAT9 or the knock-down of its gene expression increased or decreased the seed oil content, respectively. Allelic polymorphism analysis was conducted in 171 peanut germplasm, and 118 polymorphic sites in AhGPAT9A formed 64 haplotypes (a1 to a64), while 94 polymorphic sites in AhGPAT9B formed 75 haplotypes (b1 to b75). The haplotype analysis showed that a5, b57, b30 and b35 were elite haplotypes related to high oil content, whereas a7, a14, a48, b51 and b54 were low oil content types. Additionally, haplotype combinations a62/b10, a38/b31 and a43/b36 were associated with high oil content, but a9/b42 was a low oil content haplotype combination. The results will provide valuable clues for breeding new lines with higher seed oil content using hybrid polymerization of high-oil alleles of AhGPAT9A and AhGPAT9B genes.","Lv, Yuying; Zhang, Xiurong; Luo, Lu; Yang, Hui; Li, Pinghua; Zhang, Kun; Liu, Fengzhen; Wan, Yongshan",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71578-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887939/,369

142472,Europe's public-health systems gear up for future epidemics.,2020-10-01,"Recently, 454 Life Sciences Corporation proposed a new biochemical approach to DNA sequencing (the 454 sequencing). It is based on the pyrosequencing protocol. The 454 sequencing aims to give reliable output at a low cost and in a short time. The produced sequences are shorter than reads produced by classical methods. Our paper proposes a new DNA assembly algorithm which deals well with such data and outperforms other assembly algorithms used in practice. The constructed SR-ASM algorithm is a heuristic method based on a graph model, the graph being a modified DNA graph proposed for DNA sequencing by hybridization procedure. Other new features of the assembly algorithm are, among others, temporary compression of input sequences, and a new and fast multiple alignment heuristics taking advantage of the way the output data for the 454 sequencing are presented and coded. The usefulness of the algorithm has been proved in tests on raw data generated during sequencing of the whole 1.84Mbp genome of Prochlorococcus marinus bacteria and also on a part of chromosome 15 of Homo sapiens. The source code of SR-ASM can be downloaded from http://bio.cs.put.poznan.pl/ in the section 'Current research'--> 'DNA Assembly'.

144338,"Delays in Global Disease Outbreak Responses: Lessons from H1N1, Ebola, and Zika.",2018,"BACKGROUND The use of laparoscopy for right hemicolectomy has gained popularity allowing the option of a totally laparoscopic intracorporeal anastomosis (IA) for intestinal reconstruction. This technique may alleviate some of the technical limitations that a surgeon faces with a laparoscopic-assisted extracorporeal anastomosis (EA). METHODS A retrospective chart review of 195 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy by four colorectal surgeons at three institutions from March 2005 to June 2014 was performed. Multivariate regression analysis was used to compare postoperative and oncologic outcomes. RESULTS A total of 195 patients underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy over the study period, with 86 (44 %) patients receiving IA and 109 (56 %) patients receiving an EA. The most common indication for surgery in both groups was cancer: 56 (65 %) of IA cases and 57 (52 %) of EA cases. IA had a significantly higher rate of minor complications but no difference in serious complications compared to EA. Conversion to open resection was higher in EA. Using multivariate analysis to compare IA versus EA, there was no significant difference in length of stay, return of bowel function, risk of anastomotic leak, risk of intraabdominal abscess or risk of wound complications. Amongst cancer resections, there was no significant difference in the median number of lymph nodes harvested (18 LNs in IA group vs. 19 LNs in EA group, P > 0.05). There was also no significant difference in overall survival and disease-free survival at 5.7 years between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS IA in laparoscopic right hemicolectomy is associated with similar postoperative and oncologic outcomes compared to EA. IA may possess advantages in terms of conversion and flexibility of specimen extraction, but this is counterbalanced by a higher incidence of minor complications. These findings suggest that IA represents a valid technique in the arsenal of the experienced colorectal surgeon without compromising outcomes.","Hanna, Mark H; Hwang, Grace S; Phelan, Michael J; Bui, Thanh-Lan; Carmichael, Joseph C; Mills, Steven D; Stamos, Michael J; Pigazzi, Alessio",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4704-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26715015/,369

METHODS From January 23 to April 30, 2020, we performed ATAAD repair for 33 patients, including three with pregnancy-related TAADs. Confirmation of COVID-19 depended on the results of two nucleic acid tests and pulmonary computed tomography scan. Based on testing results and hemodynamic stability, patients were triaged to an isolated intensive care unit or negative pressure operating room for emergency surgery. RESULTS Mean age 50.2 ± 13.3 years and 20 were male (60.1%) and 8 patients were febrile (>37.3°C; 24.2%) and 17 were lymphopenic (51.5%). No patient was excluded from COVID-19 infection preoperatively. Extensive aortic repair with total arch replacement (TAR) was performed in 24 (72.7%), and limited proximal repair in 9 patients (27.3%). Cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times averaged 177 ± 34 and 88 ± 20 min for TAR, and 150 ± 30 and 83 ± 18 min for hemiarch, respectively. The mean operation time was 410 ± 68.3 min. Operative mortality was 6.1% (2/33). Complications included reintubation in four (12.1%), acute kidney failure in two (6.1%), and cerebral infarction in one (3.0%). No paraplegia nor re-exploration for bleeding occurred. COVID-19 was excluded in 100% eventually. No nosocomial infection occurred. Nor did any patient/surgical staff develop fever or test positive during the study period. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study show that our management protocol based on testing results and hemodynamic stability in patients with ATAAD during the COVID-19 pandemic was effective and achieved favorable early surgical outcomes.","Zhang, Chen-Han; Ma, Wei-Guo; Zhong, Yong-Liang; Ge, Yi-Peng; Li, Cheng-Nan; Qiao, Zhi-Yu; Liu, Yong-Min; Zhu, Jun-Ming; Sun, Li-Zhong",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.15041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32939857/,369

150665,Vaccines and Airline Travel: A Federal Role to Protect the Public Health.,2016,"Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) was piloted in 2009 as a program targeted to reduce neonatal mortality (NM). The program has morphed into a suite of programs termed Helping Babies Survive that includes Essential Care for Every Baby. Since 2010, the HBB and Helping Babies Survive training programs have been taught to >850 000 providers in 80 countries. Initial HBB training is associated with a significant improvement in knowledge and skills. However, at refresher training, there is a knowledge-skill gap evident, with a falloff in skills. Accumulating evidence supports the role for frequent refresher resuscitation training in facilitating skills retention. Beyond skill acquisition, HBB has been associated with a significant reduction in early NM (<24 hours) and fresh stillbirth rates. To evaluate the large-scale impact of the growth of skilled birth attendants, we analyzed NM rates in sub-Saharan Africa (n = 11) and Nepal (as areas of growing HBB implementation). All have revealed a consistent reduction in NM at 28 days between 2009 and 2018; a mean reduction of 5.34%. The number of skilled birth attendants, an indirect measure of HBB sustained rollout, reveals significant correlation with NM, fresh stillbirth, and perinatal mortality rates, highlighting HBB's success and the need for continued efforts to train frontline providers. A novel live newborn resuscitation trainer as well as a novel app (HBB Prompt) have been developed, increasing knowledge and skills while providing simulation-based repeated practice. Ongoing challenges in sustaining resources (financial and other) for newborn programming emphasize the need for innovative implementation strategies and training tools.","Perlman, Jeffrey M; Velaphi, Sithembiso; Massawe, Augustine; Clarke, Robert; Merali, Hasan S; Ersdal, Hege",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-016915k; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004641/,369

SUMMARY Current strategies include direct transportation of patients to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) (""mothership model"") or transportation to the nearest primary stroke center (PSC) and secondary transfer to the CSC (""drip-and-ship model""). Both have disadvantages. We propose the model ""flying intervention team."" Patients will be transported to the nearest PSC; if telemedically identified as eligible for thrombectomy, an intervention team will be acutely transported via helicopter to the PSC and endovascular treatment will be performed on site. Patients stay at the PSC for further stroke unit care. This model was implemented at a telestroke network in Germany. Fifteen remote hospitals participated in the project, covering 14,000 km2 and a population of 2 million. All have well established telemedically supported stroke units, an angiography suite, and a helicopter pad. Processes were defined individually for each hospital and training sessions were implemented for all stroke teams. An exclusive project helicopter was installed to be available from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. during 26 weeks per year. Key Messages: The model of the flying intervention team is likely to reduce time delays since processes will be performed in parallel, rather than consecutively, and since it is quicker to move a medical team rather than a patient.

158122,Bats and emerging zoonoses: henipaviruses and SARS.,2009,"Background Teleconsultation services in India, especially in neurosurgery, are relatively new. Despite its large-scale adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic, comprehensive analyses of patients' perspectives and hurdles are lacking. Materials and Methods We conducted an anonymized telephonic survey of consecutive neurosurgical patients who availed telemedicine services at our institute, using a validated, structured questionnaire. To prevent bias, interviewers were not involved in the study design/analyses. Patients' perception of usefulness and performance of teleconsultation was graded on a 5-point Likert scale. Results Of the 330 patients who availed teleconsultation services, 231 (70%) completed the survey. Even though 91% of the respondents had access to a smartphone, only 10% received a video-based teleconsult. As per respondents, the challenges included poor network (7%), suboptimal communication/discussion (5.6%), lack of physical examination (6%), and misinterpretation of prescription by pharmacists/patients (6%). The majority of the respondents (58%) either agreed/strongly agreed that teleconsultation helped them tide over the medical exigency during the lockdown; however, the clinical diagnosis did not influence this response (P = 0.21). The vast majority of the respondents felt that teleconsultation is beneficial (97%), as it minimizes their exposure to COVID-19. One-third of the patients preferred this service over physical visits and 60% agreed to its continuation till resumption of routine care. Access to video-teleconsultation was the chief suggestion in 39 of 74 suggestions received. Conclusions Telemedicine in neurosurgery offers favorable patient satisfaction during this pandemic and may be a satisfactory alternative to physical outpatient services in the future. Video-based teleconsults should be the preferred modality of communication for neurosurgery patients.","Raheja, Amol; Manjunath, Niveditha; Garg, Kanwaljeet; Tandon, Vivek; Gupta, Vivek; Mishra, Shashwat; Ather, Sameer; Suri, Ashish; Chandra, P Sarat; Singh, Manmohan; Shariff, Ahamadulla; Kale, Shashank S",Neurology India,https://doi.org/10.4103/0028-3886.314523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33904449/,369
158580,The demise of Public Health England.,2020-08-19,"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), particularly zoonoses, represent a significant threat to global health. Emergence is often driven by anthropogenic activity (e.g., travel, land use change). Although disease emergence frameworks suggest multiple steps from initial zoonotic transmission to human-to-human spread, there have been few attempts to empirically model specific steps. We create a process-based framework to separate out components of individual emergence steps. We focus on early emergence and expand the first step, zoonotic transmission, into processes of generation of pathogen richness, transmission opportunity, and establishment, each with its own hypothesized drivers. Using this structure, we build a spatial empirical model of these drivers, taking bat viruses shared with humans as a case study. We show that drivers of both viral richness (host diversity and climatic variability) and transmission opportunity (human population density, bushmeat hunting, and livestock production) are associated with virus sharing between humans and bats. We also show spatial heterogeneity between the global patterns of these two processes, suggesting that high-priority locations for pathogen discovery and surveillance in wildlife may not necessarily coincide with those for public health intervention. Finally, we offer direction for future studies of zoonotic EIDs by highlighting the importance of the processes underlying their emergence.","Brierley, Liam; Vonhof, Maarten J; Olival, Kevin J; Daszak, Peter; Jones, Kate E",The American naturalist,https://doi.org/10.1086/684391; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26807755/,369
158958,Thermal Imaging Systems May Pose Public Health Risks.,2021-04-06,"OBJECTIVE Accurate and robust quality measurement is critical to the future of value-based care. Having incomplete information when calculating quality measures can cause inaccuracies in reported patient outcomes. This research examines how quality calculations vary when using data from an individual electronic health record (EHR) and longitudinal data from a health information exchange (HIE) operating as a multisource registry for quality measurement. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were sampled from 53 healthcare organizations in 2018. Organizations represented both ambulatory care practices and health systems participating in the state of Kansas HIE. Fourteen ambulatory quality measures for 5300 patients were calculated using the data from an individual EHR source and contrasted to calculations when HIE data were added to locally recorded data. RESULTS A total of 79% of patients received care at more than 1 facility during the 2018 calendar year. A total of 12 994 applicable quality measure calculations were compared using data from the originating organization vs longitudinal data from the HIE. A total of 15% of all quality measure calculations changed (P < .001) when including HIE data sources, affecting 19% of patients. Changes in quality measure calculations were observed across measures and organizations. DISCUSSION These results demonstrate that quality measures calculated using single-site EHR data may be limited by incomplete information. Effective data sharing significantly changes quality calculations, which affect healthcare payments, patient safety, and care quality. CONCLUSIONS Federal, state, and commercial programs that use quality measurement as part of reimbursement could promote more accurate and representative quality measurement through methods that increase clinical data sharing.","D'Amore, John D; McCrary, Laura K; Denson, Jody; Li, Chun; Vitale, Christopher J; Tokachichu, Priyaranjan; Sittig, Dean F; McCoy, Allison B; Wright, Adam",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocab039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33712850/,369
165001,Nurses’ Readiness for Emergencies and Public Health Challenges—The Case of Saudi Arabia,2020,"Rationale: The diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) requires exclusion of known underlying autoimmunity, as present in interstitial lung diseases associated with connective tissue diseases (CTD-ILD). However, autoantibodies of unknown significance have been repeatedly detected in IPF patients. Objectives: We aimed to characterize autoreactivities in IPF patients beyond clinically established autoimmune panels by establishing an unbiased assay for de novo discovery of autoantigens in different forms of ILD and healthy controls. Methods: We developed the proteomic Differential Antigen Capture (DAC) assay, capturing patient antibodies from plasma, followed by affinity purification of lung proteins coupled to mass spectrometry. Plasma antibodies from patients with IPF (n=35), CTD-ILD (n=24) and age-matched controls (n=32) were analyzed and validated in an independent cohort (IPF: n=40; CTD-ILD: n=20). Plasma antibody binding profiles were associated with clinical meta-data including diagnosis, lung function and transplant free survival. Measurements and Main Results: We identified 586 putative autoantigens in both study cohorts with a broad heterogeneity among disease entities and cohorts. The prevalence of autoantibodies was higher in IPF compared to CTD-ILD. We identified a predictive autoimmune signature that was significantly associated with reduced transplant free survival in IPF. In particular, presence of autoantibodies to Thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) was associated with a significantly reduced survival in patients with IPF (p=0.002), independent of the study cohort, suggesting clinical relevance as predictive biomarker. Conclusions: Unbiased proteomic profiling reveals that the overall prevalence of autoantibodies is similar in IPF and CTD-ILD patients and identifies novel IPF specific autoantigens associated with patient survival.","Leuschner, G.; Mayr, C.

173246,Considerations for the design of vaccine efficacy trials during public health emergencies,2018-02-13,"Background: DISCOVER is a 3-year, observational study of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) initiating a second-line glucose-lowering therapy in 38 countries. We assessed glycemic control after 3 years in participants with HbA1c ≥ 9.0% at baseline. Methods: Factors associated with an increased likelihood of having HbA1c < 7.0% after 3 years were assessed using a hierarchical logistic regression model. Results: Of 14 691 DISCOVER participants from 37 countries, 2233 (15.2%) had sufficient HbA1c data and HbA1c ≥ 9.0% at baseline. The majority of participants were men (58.0%), and the mean age was 54.4 years (SD: 11.2 years). The mean HbA1c at baseline was 10.4% (SD: 1.4%). After 3 years, 626 participants (28.0%) had HbA1c < 7.0% and 438 (19.6%) had HbA1c ≥ 9.0%. Time since T2D diagnosis ≥ 10 years (vs.< 5 years) was associated with a decreased likelihood of having HbA1c < 7.0% at 3 years (Figure). Second-line therapy with two or more glucose-lowering drugs (vs. insulin) and having HbA1c < 7.0% at 6 months (24.2% of patients) were associated with an increased likelihood of having HbA1c < 7.0% at 3 years. Conclusions: Less than a third of participants with HbA1c ≥ 9.0% at initiation of second-line therapy reached HbA1c < 7.0% after 3 years. Early glycemic control (HbA1c < 7.0% at 6 months) was a key factor associated with attaining this target. Disclosure: F.

First, by using parametric and non-parametric change-point detection techniques, we were able to identify two different periods when the trend of daily new cases significantly changed. Second, we explored the association of these changes with data on population mobility. This also allowed us to estimate the lag between changes in human mobility and rates of daily new cases. The information was then used to establish an association between changes in population mobility and the sanitary measures adopted during the study period. Results showed that during the initial two months of the pandemic in Costa Rica, the implementation of sanitary measures and their impact on reducing human mobility translated to a mean reduction of 54% in the number of daily cases from the projected number, delaying community transmission.","Barboza, Luis A.; Vásquez, Paola Mery Gustavo Sanchez Fabio García Yury E.; Calvo, Juan G.; Rivas, Tania Pérez María Dolores Salas Daniel",Epidemiologia,https://doi.org/10.3390/epidemiologia2030022,369

Sarcopenia is an active age-related process that involves progressive losses of skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, and muscle function. Muscle failure is a major cause of frailty, disability, falls, hospitalization, dependency, institutionalization, and low quality of life in older seniors. Therefore, sarcopenia considerably heightens the annual cost of care worldwide. This narrative review elaborates on sarcopenia as a deleterious condition in old age while spotting the light on its association with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It discusses its pathophysiology and the most possible options for preventing and treating sarcopenia. The literature shows that the dynamic of sarcopenia is complex, involving multifaceted physiological alterations relevant to aging, unhealthy behaviors (e.g., undernutrition or inadequate dietary intake and physical inactivity/immobility or sedentary lifestyle), and multiple pathogenic conditions such as metabolic, inflammatory, and endocrinal disorders. Frail individuals express nutritional deficiencies, immune deficit, oxidative stress, metabolic alterations, gut microbial alterations, neurological insult, etc. Such physiological dysfunctions are closely linked to increased vulnerability to COVID-19 among older adults and people with non-communicable diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disorders, and obesity. Available studies report higher occurrence of severe COVID-19 and COVID-19-related complications (ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality) among frail compared with non-frail and prefrail individuals. Effective pharmacological treatments of sarcopenia are not currently available. However, physical activity and nutritional interventions (e.g., fast digestive proteins, vitamin D, and natural products such as bee products) may prevent the development of sarcopenia in early stages of the disease or limit disease progress. Such interventions may also lower vulnerability to COVID-19.","Ali, Amira Mohammed Kunugi Hiroshi",BioMed,https://doi.org/10.3390/biomed1010002,369

We hypothesize that the screening of S protein sequences of all the HCoVs would result in the identification of potential multi-epitope vaccine candidates capable of conferring immunity against various HCoVs. In the present study, several machine learning-based in-silico tools were employed to design a broad-spectrum multi-epitope vaccine candidate against S protein of human coronaviruses. To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the first study, where multiple B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes (CTL and HTL) were predicted from the S protein sequences of all seven known HCoVs and linked together with an adjuvant to construct a potential broad-spectrum vaccine candidate. Secondary and tertiary structures were predicted, validated and the refined 3D-model was docked with an immune receptor. The vaccine candidate was evaluated for antigenicity, allergenicity, solubility, and its ability to achieve high-level expression in bacterial hosts. Finally, the immune simulation was carried out to evaluate the immune response after three vaccine doses. The designed vaccine is antigenic (with or without the adjuvant), non-allergenic, binds well with TLR-3 receptor and might elicit a diverse and strong immune response.","Kumar, Avinash; Rathi, Ekta; Kini, Suvarna G",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.02.442313,369

Many children, adolescents and adults have experienced adverse mental health effects related to the pandemic and its impact on daily life, although the long-term impact on individuals and health systems is not well understood. Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on data from 2018-2021 collected via medical records from our hospital. Admissions were transformed into time-series data, and models were generated to analyze changes in admission rates for mental health emergencies in 2020 and 2021 compared to previous years. Results: Of 1906 inpatient encounters among 1543 unique patients seen by the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Consultation-Liaison service, there was a decrease in overall admissions beginning in March 2020, coinciding with statewide lock down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, admissions were reduced 36% compared to average admissions from 2018-2019. By 2021, overall admissions were significantly higher than for the previous three years. Similarly, the count of suicide attempts was significantly higher in 2021 compared to previous years. The rate of patients admitted to inpatient facilities upon discharge was significantly higher during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Conclusion: Admissions for mental health emergencies fluctuated during the period associated with the COVID-19 pandemic across an array of diagnoses. Increases in admissions and severity of mental health emergencies during COVID-19 may reflect a detrimental impact of the pandemic on the mental health of children, as well as unmet needs during this time.","Coates, L.; Marshall, R.; Johnson, K.; Foster, B.

185596,Health and foreign policy: influences of migration and population mobility.,2007,"The length and quality of life is important to us all, yet identification of promising drug targets for human ageing using genetics has had limited success. Here, we combine six large European-ancestry genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of human ageing traits—healthspan, father and mother lifespan, exceptional longevity, frailty index, and self-rated health—in a principal component framework that maximises their shared genetic architecture. The first principal component (GIP1) is more heritable than the original studies and shows strong genetic correlations with length of life as well as multiple indices of mental and physical wellbeing. We identify 27 genomic regions associated with GIP1, and provide additional, independent evidence for an effect on human ageing for loci near HTT and MAML3 using a study of Finnish and Japanese subject survival. Across the genome, GIP1 associations are enriched in genes involved in haem metabolism and pathways related to transcription, neurogenesis, homeostasis, proteolysis, intracellular signalling, immunity, and the muscle system. Finally, using proteome-wide two-sample Mendelian randomisation and colocalisation, we provide robust evidence for a detrimental effect of blood levels of apolipoprotein(a) (LPA) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) on GIP1. Together, our results demonstrate that combining multiple ageing traits using genetic principal components enhances power to detect biological targets for human ageing.","Timmers, Paul R. H.

185929,Ensuring a broad and inclusive approach: a provincial perspective on pandemic preparedness.,2005,"The collection and sharing of accurate data is paramount to the fight against COVID-19. However, the health system in many countries is fragmented. Furthermore, because no one was prepared for COVID-19, manual information systems have been put in place in many health facilities to collect and record COVID-19 data. This reality brings many challenges such as delay, inaccuracy and inconsistency in the COVID-19 data collected for the control and monitoring of the pandemic. Recent studies have developed ontologies for COVID-19 data modeling and acquisition. However, the scopes of these ontologies have been the modeling of patients, available medical infrastructures, and biology and biomedical aspects of COVID-19. This study extends these existing ontologies to develop the COVID-19 ontology (COVIDonto) to model the origin, symptoms, spread and treatment of COVID-19. The NeOn methodology was followed to gather data from secondary sources to formalize the COVIDonto ontology in Description Logics (DLs). The COVIDonto ontology was implemented in a machine-executable form with the Web Ontology Language (OWL) in Protégé ontology editor. The COVIDonto ontology is a formal executable model of COVID-19 that can be leveraged in web-based applications to integrate health facilities in a country for the automatic acquisition and sharing of COVID-19 data. Moreover, the COVIDonto could serve as a medium for cross-border interoperability of government systems of various countries and facilitate data sharing in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fonou-Dombeu, J.

In older birds, field evidence indicates the possible involvement of TCoV in egg-production drops in turkey hens. However, no experimental studies have been conducted to demonstrate TCoV pathogenesis in turkey hens and its effect on reproductive performance. In the present study, we assessed the possible effect of TCoV on the reproductive performance of experimentally infected turkey hens. In two separate trials, 29- to 30-wk-old turkey hens in peak egg production were either mock-infected or inoculated orally with TCoV (Indiana strain). Cloacal swabs and intestinal and reproductive tissues were collected and standard reverse-transcription PCR was conducted to detect TCoV RNA. In the cloacal swabs, TCoV was detected consistently at 3, 5, 7, and 12 days postinoculation (DPI) with higher rates of detection after 5 DPI (> 90%). All intestinal samples were also positive for TCoV at 7 DPI, and microscopic lesions consisting of severe enteritis with villous atrophy were observed in the duodenum and jejunum of TCoV-infected hens. In one of the trials TCoV was detected from the oviduct of two birds at 7 DPI; however, no or mild microscopic lesions were present. In both experimental trials an average of 28%-29% drop in egg production was observed in TCoV-infected turkey hens between 4 and 7 DPI. In a separate trial we also confirmed that TCoV can efficiently transmit from infected to contact control hens. Our results show that TCoV infection can affect the reproductive performance in turkey hens, causing a transient drop in egg production. This drop in egg production most likely occurred as consequence of the severe enteritis produced by the TCoV. However, the potential replication of TCoV in the oviduct and its effect on pathogenesis should be considered and further investigated.","Awe, Olusegun O; Ali, Ahmed; Elaish, Mohamed; Ibrahim, Mahmoud; Murgia, Maria; Pantin-Jackwood, Mary; Saif, Yehia M; Lee, Chang-Won",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24283132/,369

SNAIL, a zinc finger transcription factor, is strongly involved in tumor, what makes its signaling pathways an interesting research subject. The necessity of tracking activation of intracellular pathways has prompted fluorescent proteins usage as localization markers. Advanced molecular cloning techniques allow to generate fusion proteins from fluorescent markers and transcription factors. Depending on fusion strategy, the protein expression levels and nuclear transport ability are significantly different. The P2A self-cleavage motif through its cleavage ability allows two single proteins to be simultaneously expressed. The aim of this study was to compare two strategies for introducing a pair of genes using expression vector system. We have examined GFP and SNAI1 gene fusions by comprising common nucleotide polylinker (multiple cloning site) or P2A motif in between them, resulting in one fusion or two independent protein expressions respectively. In each case transgene expression levels and translation efficiency as well as nuclear localization of expressed protein have been analyzed. Our data showed that usage of P2A motif provides more effective nuclear transport of SNAIL transcription factor than conventional genes linker. At the same time the fluorescent marker spreads evenly in subcellular space.","Adamus, Tomasz; Konieczny, Paweł; Sekuła, Małgorzata; Sułkowski, Maciej; Majka, Marcin",Acta biochimica Polonica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25180219/,369

Ten groups of pigs with acute respiratory disease during the months September to October 1991 and seven groups of pigs with acute diarrhoea during the months February to March 1992 were investigated. On arrival in the fattening herds, more of the pigs were negative for antibodies against H1N1-influenza virus and against PRCV during September to October (61 and 50 per cent, respectively) than in February to March (51 and 34 per cent, respectively). There was serological evidence of a triple infection with PRCV and both influenza viruses in seven of the 17 groups; dual infections with PRCV and H1N1-influenza virus occurred in nine groups and with H1N1- and H3N2-influenza viruses in one group. Seroconversion against TGEV was not detected in any of the 17 groups, but seven of them had seroconverted to PEDV. Multiple infections with PRCV and either one or both of the influenza viruses were thus very common shortly after the introduction of feeder pigs into the fattening herds. There was no association between the type and/or multiplicity of these infections and respiratory disease, but infections with PEDV were clearly associated with outbreaks of diarrhoea.","Van Reeth, K; Pensaert, M",The Veterinary record,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7900243/,369

Effective social distancing, unless enforced as drastic lockdowns and mandatory cordon sanitaire, requires consistent strict collective adherence. However, it remains unknown what the determinants for the resultant compliance of social distancing and their impact on disease mitigation are. Here, we incorporate into the epidemiological process with an evolutionary game theory model that governs the evolution of social distancing behavior. In our model, we assume an individual acts in their best interest and their decisions are driven by adaptive social learning of the real-time risk of infection in comparison with the cost of social distancing. We find interesting oscillatory dynamics of social distancing accompanied with waves of infection. Moreover, the oscillatory dynamics are dampened with a nontrivial dependence on model parameters governing decision-makings and gradually cease when the cumulative infections exceed the herd immunity. Compared to the scenario without social distancing, we quantify the degree to which social distancing mitigates the epidemic and its dependence on individuals' responsiveness and rationality in their behavior changes. Our work offers new insights into leveraging human behavior in support of pandemic response.","Glaubitz, Alina; Fu, Feng",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33269302/,369

It is unclear how viral genomic and subgenomic mRNAs compete with each other for the cellular translation machinery. Translation of the uncapped Barley yellow dwarf virus genomic RNA (gRNA) and subgenomic RNA1 (sgRNA1) is driven by the powerful cap-independent translation element (BTE) in their 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). The BTE forms a kissing stem-loop interaction with the 5' UTR to mediate translation initiation at the 5' end. Here, using reporter mRNAs that mimic gRNA and sgRNA1, we show that the abundant sgRNA2 inhibits translation of gRNA, but not sgRNA1, in vitro and in vivo. This trans inhibition requires the functional BTE in the 5' UTR of sgRNA2, but no translation of sgRNA2 itself is detectable. The efficiency of translation of the viral mRNAs in the presence of sgRNA2 is determined by proximity to the mRNA 5' end of the stem-loop that kisses the 3' BTE. Thus, the gRNA and sgRNA1 have ""tuned"" their expression efficiencies via the site in the 5' UTR to which the 3' BTE base pairs. We conclude that sgRNA2 is a riboregulator that switches off translation of replication genes from gRNA while permitting translation of structural genes from sgRNA1. These results reveal (i) a new level of control of subgenomic-RNA gene expression, (ii) a new role for a viral subgenomic RNA, and (iii) a new mechanism for RNA-mediated regulation of translation.","Shen, Ruizhong; Rakotondrafara, Aurélie M; Miller, W Allen",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17005682/,369

RESULTS Of the 23 children with COVID-19, 17 had family aggregation. Three children (13%) had asymptomatic infection, 6 (26%) had mild type, and 14 (61%) had common type. Among these 23 children, 16 (70%) had fever, 11 (48%) had cough, 8 (35%) had fever and cough, and 8 (35%) had wet rales in the lungs. The period from disease onset or the first nucleic acid-positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 to the virus nucleic acid negative conversion was 6-24 days (median 12 days). Of the 23 children, 3 had a reduction in total leukocyte count, 2 had a reduction in lymphocytes, 2 had an increase in C-reactive protein, and 2 had an increase in D-dimer. Abnormal pulmonary CT findings were observed in 12 children, among whom 9 had patchy ground-glass opacities in both lungs. All 23 children received antiviral therapy and were recovered. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 in children aged <18 years often occurs with family aggregation, with no specific clinical manifestation and laboratory examination results. Most of these children have mild symptoms and a good prognosis.

Most of these long-term interleukin-2-dependent cell lines exhibited a pattern characteristic of CD4(+)-activated T cells with high expression of CD2, CD3 and CD4 antigens, associated with a strong density of TAC and DR molecules. Nevertheless, in five cases CD8 expression was present at a significant level. HTLV-I antigens were never detected in uncultured PBMC, but they were expressed in a few cells after short-term culture and after 4 months the majority of the cells were HTLV-I positive, as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) using polyclonal or monoclonal anti-p19 and anti-p24 antibodies. Low and variable levels of reverse transcriptase activity were detected in supernatant fluids of these cell lines only after 4 months of culture, when at least 50% of the cells exhibited HTLV-I antigens by IF. However, numerous type C HTLV-I-like viral particles were detected, mostly in the extracellular spaces, with rare budding particles.

On the other hand, in a pandemic situation, numerous hospitals have suffered periods of great healthcare pressure. The objective of this work was to present an experience of medicalization of a residence where almost 50% of the residents contracted the disease. METHODS A multidisciplinary intervention was carried out in a publicly owned nursing home with 99 residents. Specialists from Internal Medicine, Primary Care and health technicians worked together, in close collaboration with the residence workers. The presence of nursing personnel 24 hours a day and medical personnel with daily visits was enabled. The center was provided with the necessary means to administer the medication (oral and intravenous) and oxygen therapy necessary to care for patients with the disease. Analytical results were available within 24 hours. For data analysis, the percentages were calculated and the mean was used as a measure of central tendency. RESULTS Forty-eight residents (48.5%) and fifteen workers contracted the disease. The total number of deaths during that period was thirteen (13.1%), seven of them diagnosed with COVID-19 (mean age 84.4 years), with a fatality rate of 14.6%. Eleven patients (22%) diagnosed with COVID-19 were hospitalized, two of whom died during admission.

Infection transmitted more rapidly but ultimately resulted in fewer infected individuals in the small-world, compared with the random, network. The ability of measures of network centrality to identify high-risk individuals was also assessed. ""Centrality"" describes an individual's position in a population; numerous parameters are available to assess this attribute. Here, the authors use the centrality measures degree (number of contacts), random-walk betweenness (a measure of the proportion of times an individual lies on the path between other individuals), shortest-path betweenness (the proportion of times an individual lies on the shortest path between other individuals), and farness (the sum of the number of steps between an individual and all other individuals). Each was associated with time to infection and risk of infection in the simulated outbreaks. In the networks examined, degree (which is the most readily measured) was at least as good as other network parameters in predicting risk of infection. Identification of more central individuals in populations may be used to inform surveillance and infection control strategies.","Christley, R M; Pinchbeck, G L; Bowers, R G; Clancy, D; French, N P; Bennett, R; Turner, J",American journal of epidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16177140/,369

These patients generally have problems in mounting effective immune responses against pathogens such as viruses. On the other hand they typically have higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in their peripheral blood. Both of these features may work in favor of COVID-19. Since robust immune responses are needed to prevent infection in the initial stages of COVID-19, the impaired immune system may not be able to cope effectively with the highly replicating SARS-CoV2. In advanced stages of the disease wherein the inflammation as well as the cytokine storm are the core players, a high baseline inflammatory cytokines could intensify and substantially exacerbate the immunopathological situation. Presence of COVID-19 in HD patients may also be a complex immunological condition. Immunological alterations in HD patients and their potential effects on the fate of the SARSCoV- 2 infection are discussed here.

This process has been called dysdifferentiation. Normal diploid cells grown in tissue culture conditions undergo numerous biochemical and morphological changes and have a finite division potential. These changes could be a result of such a dysdifferentiation process. Changes in the differentiated state of a cell are frequently manifested by the expression of genes that are normally repressed. Previous studies have shown about a two-fold age-dependent increase of alpha and beta globin-like RNA in mouse brain and liver tissues. Therefore, the possible presence and increase of globin RNA was investigated in the nonerythroid human diploid strain WI-38 grown in tissue culture as a function of population doublings. A DNA X RNA hybridization technique using specific complementary DNA (cDNA) to alpha and beta human globin was used to detect possible complementary RNA sequences in total cellular RNA preparations extracted from cells at population doublings of 26.4 and 46. No globin-like RNA sequences could be detected above background noise levels for either of these two passage numbers. Thus, the globin RNA genes appear to be highly repressed and this degree of repression maintained as the culture approaches its characteristic population doubling limit.","Kator, K; Cristofalo, V; Charpentier, R; Cutler, R G",Gerontology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3840764/,369

Progress and prospects.,1970,"The sudden appearance and potential lethality of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in humans has resulted in a focusing of new attention on the determination of both its origins and evolution. The relationship existing between SARS-CoV and other groups of coronaviruses was determined via analyses of phylogenetic trees and comparative genomic analyses of the coronavirus genes: polymerase (Orf1ab), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). Although the coronaviruses are traditionally classed into 3 groups, with SARS-CoV forming a 4th group, the phylogenetic position and origins of SARS-CoV remain a matter of some controversy. Thus, we conducted extensive phylogenetic analyses of the genes common to all coronavirus groups, using the Neighbor-joining, Maximum-likelihood, and Bayesian methods. Our data evidenced largely identical topology for all of the obtained phylogenetic trees, thus supporting the hypothesis that the relationship existing between SARS-CoV and group 2 coronavirus is a monophyletic one. Additional comparative genomic studies, including sequence similarity and protein secondary structure analyses, suggested that SARS-CoV may bear a closer relationship with group 2 than with the other coronavirus groups. Although our data strongly suggest that group 2 coronaviruses are most closely related with SARS-CoV, further and more detailed analyses may provide us with an increased amount of information regarding the origins and evolution of the coronaviruses, most notably SARS-CoV.","Kim, Ok Ju; Lee, Dong Hun; Lee, Chan Hee",Journal of microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16554722/,369
196388,Ten years of fighting bird flu.,2007,"OBJECTIVE To determine, using the perspective of a hospital-based palliative care service (PCS), the spiritual and psychosocial impact of a novel and potentially fatal viral epidemic on patients, their families and health care workers. DESIGN Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed using the constant comparative method and were validated using respondent validation. PARTICIPANTS Eight palliative care workers. SETTING Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), the hospital designated to manage all cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Singapore. RESULTS Disease containment resulted in isolation, where isolation meant the disruption of connectedness. This disruption of connectedness took place at multiple levels: in the patient himself, between the patient and the family, within the family, between the patient and the health care worker, between the patient and society, and between health care workers. As the nature of the disease was uncertain, prognostication was inaccurate. This created difficulties in helping patients and their families prepare for death. The fear of facing the unknown led to safety-seeking behaviours, which could be overcome by repeated exposure to the feared situation. The process of bereavement was disturbed, as traditional death rituals could not be performed by the family. Informants perceived themselves to be suffering as they suffered the same anxieties, fears and grief as the patient. CONCLUSIONS Dealing with a novel viral epidemic creates spiritual and psychosocial issues similar to those encountered in a palliative care practice. Palliative care workers would do well to be aware of such issues and act proactively when such epidemics arise.","Leong, Ian Yi-Onn; Lee, Angel Onn-Kei; Ng, Tzer Wee; Lee, Lay Beng; Koh, Nien Yue; Yap, Eliada; Guay, Sarah; Ng, Lee Min",Palliative medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14982202/,369
197382,Accuracy of clinical diagnosis versus the World Health Organization case definition in the Amoy Garden SARS cohort.,2003,"BACKGROUND Root cause analyses show that up to 70 % of adverse events are caused by human error. Strong non-technical skills (NTS) can prevent or reduce these errors, considerable numbers of which occur in the operating theatre. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) requires manipulation of more complex equipment than open procedures, likely requiring a different set of NTS for each kind of team. The aims of this study were to identify the MIS teams' key NTS and investigate the effect of training and assessment of NTS on MIS teams. METHODS The databases of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, PsycINFO, and Scopus were systematically searched according to Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Articles containing outcome measures related to MIS teams' key NTS, training, or assessment of NTS were included. RESULTS The search yielded 1984 articles, 11 of which were included. All were observational studies without blinding, and they differed in aims, types of evaluation, and outcomes. Only two studies evaluated patient outcomes other than operative time, and overall, the studies' quality of evidence was low. Different communication types were encountered in MIS compared to open surgery, mainly due to equipment- and patient-related challenges. Fixed teams improved teamwork and safety levels, while deficient planning and poor teamwork were found to obstruct workflow and increase errors. Training NTS mitigates these issues and improves staff attitudes towards NTS. CONCLUSIONS MIS teams' NTS are important for workflow and prevention of errors and can be enhanced by working in fixed teams. In the technological complex sphere of MIS, communication revolves around equipment- and patient-related topics, much more so than in open surgery. In all, only a few heterogeneous-design studies have examined this. In the future, the focus should shift to systematically identifying key NTS and developing effective, evidence-based team training programmes in MIS.","Gjeraa, Kirsten; Spanager, Lene; Konge, Lars; Petersen, René H; Østergaard, Doris",Surgical endoscopy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27066972/,369
197484,[Preparatory guidelines for local health services on how to respond to new cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)].,2004,"This paper presents a case study of how colonial legacies in Uganda have affected the shape and breadth of community participation in health system governance. Using Habermas's theory of deliberative democracy and the right to health, we examine the key components required for decolonizing health governance in postcolonial countries. We argue that colonization distorts community participation, which is critical for building a strong state and a responsive health system. Participation processes grounded in the principles of democracy and the right to health increase public trust in health governance. The introduction and maintenance of British laws in Uganda, and their influence over local health governance, denies citizens the opportunity to participate in key decisions that affect them, which impacts public trust in the government. Postcolonial societies must tackle how imported legal frameworks exclude and limit community participation. Without meaningful participation, health policy implementation and accountability will remain elusive.","Mulumba, Moses; Ruano, Ana Lorena; Perehudoff, Katrina; Ooms, Gorik",Health and human rights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34194218/,369
197606,Global Fund withdraws grants to Myanmar.,2005,"BACKGROUND Hydatid liver cysts are rare in North America. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal surgical management for hydatid liver cysts treated outside endemic areas. METHODS We reviewed the cases of consecutive patients who underwent management of hydatid liver cysts. Radical liver resections were compared with other types of procedures. Clinical presentation, investigations, perioperative outcomes and longterm follow-up were evaluated. We evaluated disease recurrence using the Kaplan- Meier method. RESULTS Forty patients underwent surgery for hydatid liver cysts. Most patients had single (68%) right-sided (46%) cysts with a median size of 10 cm. Most (83%) underwent liver resection with or without drainage/marsupialization. Radical liver resection was carried out in 60% (19 major, 5 minor). Additional procedures were required in 50% (biliary fistulization 30%, diaphragmatic fistulization 20% or paracaval location/ fusion 8%). Postoperative complications occurred in 48%. The median follow-up was 39 months. The 3-year recurrence-free survival was significantly different between patients who had radical resection and those who had other procedures (100% v. 71%, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION The surgical management of hydatid liver cysts in North America remains rare and challenging and is frequently associated with fistulizing complications. Excellent long-term outcomes are best achieved using principles of radical liver resection that are familiar to North American surgeons.","Martel, Guillaume; Ismail, Salima; Bégin, André; Vandenbroucke-Menu, Franck; Lapointe, Réal",Canadian journal of surgery.

It is therefore important to be aware of the key demographic and contextual risk factors for factitious hypoglycaemia, as well the investigations and management options available for suspected cases. SUBJECTS AND METHODS In this article we describe a case report and literature review of factitious hypoglycaemia. The search was conducted using the PubMed database and identified 23 case reports of 31 patients aged 18 or over with insulin-induced factitious hypoglycaemia. RESULTS The average age of these patients was 33.7 (±13.5) years, the female: male ratio was 4.3:1, 38% had medical occupations or past medical training, 53% had diabetes mellitus, and 41% had a positive psychiatric history. Misdiagnoses were common and often resulted in inappropriate treatment. Very few cases discussed psychiatric management. CONCLUSIONS Factitious hypoglycaemia is more commonly reported in middle-aged females, in a medical profession, with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus and psychiatric illness. However, it may affect a variety of patients and the absence of these features should not discourage a diagnosis. C-peptide levels and insulin assays can help identify factitious hypoglycaemia over other causes of hypoglycaemia, and management should include a greater focus on psychiatric treatment.","Kyriacou, Harry; Duggleby, William; Hatoum, Adam; Khan, Tahir; Manley, George; Filippidou, Maria",Psychiatria Danubina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890374/,369

Fever, dry cough and fatigue were the main manifestations, but the primary concern is cases that deteriorated to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The outbreak of COVID- 19 in Israel, in March 2020 caused major changes in the routine work in hospitals. Hasharon hospital, a small community hospital in Petah Tikvah was converted to corona patients' admissions only. In accordance with this new reality, the physiotherapy service prepared itself to provide treatments tailored to the clinical needs of the Covid 19 patients and the quarantine conditions of these patients' hospitalization. During a period of 2 months, we built a unique protocol adjusted to isolated patients and staff, including telemedicine and hands-on treatment.

202410,"Strengthening Social and Economic, Medical, and Public Health Systems Before Disasters Strike",2021,"Rationale: North America is currently facing an opioid epidemics. Over 130 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose and the COVID-19 pandemic has increased opioid usage and opioid-related deaths. Respiratory depression is the main cause of morbidity and mortality from opioids. We have previously shown that leptin acts as respiratory stimulant and prevents opioid-induced respiratory depression and upper airway obstruction without reducing analgesia. In this study, we aimed to examine if intranasal (IN) administration of leptin effectively delivers leptin to the brain and prevents opioid-related deaths. Methods: To determine leptin delivery to the brain male C57BL/6J mice, were treated with IN leptin at 1.2 mg/kg in 1% BSA (n=5) or 1% BSA (n=5) and sacrificed 20 min later. Brains were harvested, the olfactory bulbs, medullas and hypotalami were isolated, quick frozen and stored at-80°C. For leptin level measurements, brain tissue was homogenized, protease inhibitors and protein concentrations were determined and ELISA was performed. To determine the survival probability, male C57BL/6J mice, 12 weeks of age, received IN leptin (n=26) or vehicle (n=25) at 1.2 mg/kg and 30 minutes later received a bolus of intraperitoneal (IP) morphine at 400mg/kg. Mice were video monitored for 24 hours and survival time after morphine injection was recorded Results: IN leptin significantly increased leptin levels in the olfactory bulb (from 0 ng/mL to 7.53 ng/mL, p = 0.004) and medulla (from 0.008 ng/mL to 0.107 ng/mL) and presented a trend in the hypothalamus (from 0.018 ng/mL to 0.291 ng/mL, p = 0.1). Mice that received IN leptin had a higher survival rate when compared to mice that received vehicle (69% vs 92%, p = 0.044, Figure). Conclusion: We demonstrated that the intranasal route is effective for the delivery of leptin to the brain and that leptin reduced opioid-induced mortality.

Additionally, the fear of loss, coupled with social distancing, lockdown, economic instability, and uncertainty, have led to a significant psychosocial impact that will have to be addressed. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment such as face masks or face coverings have become a daily necessity. While ""mass masking"" along with hand hygiene and social distancing became more widespread, new issues began to emerge - particularly in those who wore spectacles as a means of vision correction. As we began to see routine patients again after the first lockdown had been lifted, many patients visited our clinics for refractive surgery consultations with a primary motivating factor of wanting spectacle independence due to the fogging of their spectacles as a result of wearing a mask. In this article, we report on new emerging issues in eye care due to the widespread use of masks and on the new unmet need in the corneal and cataract refractive surgery fields.","Cummings, Arthur B; Gildea, Cian; Brézin, Antoine P; Malyugin, Boris E; Evren Kemer, Ozlem; Kermani, Omid; Prieto, Isabel; Rejdak, Robert; Teus, Miguel A; Tognetto, Daniele; Zweifel, Sandrine; Toro, Mario D",Eur J Ophthalmol,,369

In the face of a pandemic or similar emergencies, communities of people who use drugs face risks that result from their ongoing drug use, reduced ability to secure treatment for drug use and correlated maladies, lack of access to preventive hygiene, and the realities of homelessness, street-level policing, and criminal justice involvement. Herein, we document the efforts of a coalition of people who use drugs, advocates, service providers, and academics to implement solutions to reduce these risks at a municipal and state level focusing on New Haven and the State of Connecticut. This coalition identified the communities at risk: active users needing access to harm reduction services, persons in treatment needing access to their medications, the homeless and marginally housed needing improved hygiene, people engaged in sex work, and the incarcerated needing release from custody. The section describing each of the risks demonstrates how the coalition acted preemptively at early stages of the pandemic, ahead of official initiatives, to develop ameliorative risk reduction solutions.

218452,100 years of public health: the vision of the FUNASA/100 anos de saúde pública: a visão da FUNASA,2004,"Background: Recommendations on lifestyles during quarantine have been proposed by researchers and institutions since the COVID-19 crisis emerged. However, most of these have never been tested under real quarantine situations or derive from older investigations conducted mostly in China and Canada in the face of infections other than COVID-19. The present study aimed at exploring the relationship between a comprehensive set of recommended lifestyles, socio-demographic, and personality variables and mood during the first stages of quarantine. Methods: A virtual snow-ball recollection technique was used to disseminate the survey across the general population in Spain starting the first day of mandatory quarantine (15 March 2020) until three days later (17 March). In total, 2683 Spanish adults (mean age = 34.86 years, SD = 13.74 years; 77.7% women) from the general population completed measures on socio-demographic, COVID-related, behavioral, personality/cognitive, and mood characteristics. Results: In the present study, depression and anger were higher than levels reported in a previous investigation before the COVID-19 crisis, while vigor, friendliness, and fatigue were lower. Anxiety levels were comparable. The expected direction of associations was confirmed for the majority of predictors. However, effect sizes were generally small and only a subset of them correlated to most outcomes. Intolerance of unpleasant emotions, neuroticism, and, to a lesser extent, agreeableness, sleep quality, young age, and time spent Internet surfing were the most robust and strongest correlates of mood states. Conclusions: Some recommended lifestyles (i.e., maintaining good quality of sleep and reducing Internet surfing) might be more important than others during the first days of quarantine. Promoting tolerance to unpleasant emotions (e.g., through online, self-managed programs) might also be of upmost importance. So far, recommendations have been made in general, but certain subgroups (e.g., certain personality profiles and young adults) might be especially vulnerable and should receive more attention.","Suso-Ribera, Carlos; Martín-Brufau, Ramón",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,369

225872,"Building ""Bridges"" to Equity",2021,"Background: The task of the Competence Centers for vocational training (KW) is to increase the attractiveness and quality of vocational (=post-graduate) training in general practice. For this purpose, they offer, among other things, a structured seminar program for post-graduate trainees in general practice (GP-trainees). During the Covid-19 pandemic the seminar program of the KWBW-Verbundweiterbildungplus® in Baden-Württemberg was converted to digital formats. The goal of the paper is to evaluate the acceptance by the GP-trainees and lecturers, to describe experiences with the conversion to e-learning and to derive recommendations with regard to the future orientation of seminar programs in post-graduate as well as continuing medical education. The implementation was based on a modified Kern-cycle and aimed at offering eight teaching units of 45 minutes each to a large number of GP-trainees. It tried to maintain the high quality of content and education as well as the interactive character of the previous seminars. For this purpose, the events were designed as synchronous webinars (six units) with asynchronous preparation and post-processing (two units) according to the flipped classroom method. The evaluation by the participating GP-trainees and lecturers was performed online using a multi-center developed and pre-piloted questionnaire. Results and discussion: N=101 GP-trainees participated in the evaluation of five individual seminar days in the second quarter of 2020 (response rate 97%). 58% (N=59) of the trainees were satisfied or very satisfied with the implementation. 82% (n=83) rated pre-tasks as helpful. 99% (n=100) would participate in an online seminar again. For 52% (n=53) of the trainees, the attitude towards e-learning had changed positively. The main advantages mentioned were no travel, save in time and costs as well as increased flexibility. The main disadvantages mentioned were less personal interaction and technical obstacles. The high acceptance of the new digital format showed the fundamental potential of e-learning in continuing medical education. The experiences can be a source of inspiration for other departments and KW. However, it also shows that important goals of KW, such as the personal interaction of the peer group, could not be achieved. In the future, it is important to develop a suitable mix of presence and digital formats with the aim to improve the attractiveness as well as sustainability of continuing medical education.","Förster, Christian; Eismann-Schweimler, Jessica; Stengel, Sandra; Bischoff, Martina; Fuchs, Monika; Graf von Luckner, Andreas; Ledig, Thomas; Barzel, Anne; Maun, Andy; Joos, Stefanie; Szecsenyi, Joachim; Schwill, Simon",GMS J Med Educ,,369

235608,COVID19 - Why open and honest public dialogue is needed,2020,"BackgroundThe emerging threat represented by SARS-CoV-2 variants, demands the development of therapies for better clinical management of COVID-19. MAD0004J08 is an extremely potent Fc-engineered monoclonal antibody (mAb) able to neutralise in vitro all current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs). This ongoing study, evaluates safety, pharmacokinetics and SARS-CoV-2 sera neutralization effect of MAD0004J08 when administered as single dose intramuscularly in healthy adults. MethodWe conducted a dose escalation study with sequential enrolment of three cohorts, each with an increasing dose level of MAD0004J08 (48mg, 100mg and 400mg). Within each cohort, 10 young healthy adults were randomized with 4:1 ratio to a single intramuscular (i.m.) injection of MAD0004J08 or placebo. The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with severe and/or serious treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) within 7 days post-treatment. Secondary endpoints reported in this paper are the proportion of subjects with solicited TEAEs up 7 days post dosing, MAD0004J08 serum concentrations and neutralising activity versus the original SARS-COV-2 Wuhan virus at different timepoints post-dosing. As post-hoc analyses, we compared the sera neutralising titres of subjects who received MAD0004J08 with those of people that had received the COVID-19 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in the previous sixty days (n=10) and COVID-19 convalescent patients (n=20), and assessed serum neutralisation activity against the B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.1.248 (gamma) SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. FindingsA total of 30 subjects, 10 per cohort, were enrolled and randomized. Data up to 30 days were available and analysed in this report. No severe TEAEs were reported in any of the cohorts in the 7 days post-treatment. MAD0004J08 was detected in the sera of treated subjects within few hours post-administration and reached almost maximal levels on day 8. The geometric mean neutralising titres (GMT) assessed against the original Wuhan virus peaked on day 8 and ranged 226 - 905, 905 - 2,560, and 1,280 - 5,120 for cohort 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The sera neutralising GMT in MAD0004J08 treated subjects in all the three cohorts were found to be 1{middle dot}5-54{middle dot}5-fold higher compared to sera from convalescent patients and 1{middle dot}83- 76{middle dot}4-fold higher compared to sera from COVID-19 vaccinees. Finally, GMT in MAD0004J08 treated subjects showed high neutralising titres versus the B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.1.248 (gamma) SARS-CoV-2 VoCs. InterpretationA single dose administration of MAD0004J08 via i.m. route is safe and well tolerated and results in a rapid systemic distribution of the MAD0004J08 and sera neutralising titres higher than COVID-19 convalescent and vaccinated subjects. A single dose administration of MAD0004J08 is also sufficient to effectively neutralise major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Based on these results, a Phase 2-3 trial is ongoing to further assess the safety, dosage, and efficacy of MAD0004J08 in asymptomatic or mild-moderate symptomatic COVID-19 patients. FundingEU Malaria Fund, Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico, Ministero della Salute, Regione Toscana, Toscana Life Sciences Sviluppo and European Research Council. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PUBMED, MEDLINE and MedRxiv for clinical trials, meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials evaluating the antibody neutralization titres vs. different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern obtained from subjects who received monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19 using the following search terms: (""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"") AND (""monoclonal antibody"" OR ""neutralising antibody"") AND (""variants"" OR ""variants of concern""). No relevant studies were identified. Added value of this studyThis is the first human study assessing safety, PK and neutralising potential of MAD0004J08, a monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 wild type Wuhan virus and variants of concern, administered intramuscularly at low dosages (48, 100 and 400 mg). MAD0004J08 showed to be safe and well tolerated in the tested dose range. Anti-spike antibodies were detected in the sera of tested SARS-CoV-2 negative healthy adults few hours post-injection. In addition, the sera obtained from MAD0004J08treated subjects, showed to have high neutralisation titres against the Wuhan virus, the B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.1.248 (gamma) variants of concern. Implications of all the available evidenceA potent monoclonal antibody such as MAD0004J08, capable of neutralising multiple variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2 rapidly and long lastingly when given as a single intramuscular injection. The antibody, presently tested in a phase 2-3 efficacy trial, can be a major advancement in the prophylaxis and clinical management of COVID-19, because of its broad spectrum, ease of use in non-hospital settings and economic sustainability.","Lanini, Simone; Milleri, Stefano; Andreano, Emanuele; Nosari, Sarah; Paciello, Ida; Piccini, Giulia; Gentili, Alessandra; Phogat, Adhuna; Hyseni, Inesa; Leonardi, Margherita; Torelli, Alessandro; Montomoli, Emanuele; Paolini, Andrea; Frosini, Andrea; Antinori, Andrea; Nicastri, Emanuele; Girardi, Enrico; Plazzi, Maria Maddalena; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Vaia, Francesco; Cioppa, Giovanni Della; Rappuoli, Rino",,,369

243525,28.I. Workshop: Communication in public health: neglected but essential,2020,"Individuals must navigate complex media environments filled with frequently changing and varyingly credible information to acquire and apply health information during times of uncertainty and danger. A process model tested in two U.S. national surveys in spring (N = 1220) and summer (N = 1264) of 2020 tested how three media literacy constructs (about sources, content, and science information) predicted the adoption of behaviors protective for COVID-19. Results showed that the three media literacy constructs were mediated by knowledge of COVID-19 (wave 1 TE = 0.190;wave 2 TE = 0.190) and expectancies (wave 1 TE = 0.496;wave 2 TE = 0.613). The model was confirmed as largely consistent across the two waves of data collection with independent samples. Results show the importance of expectancies for mediating the effects of media literacy, efficacy, and knowledge on behavior. The study suggests that media literacy and science media literacy skills aid health behavior adoption by contributing to knowledge gain and expectancies.","Austin, E. W.; Austin, B.

245996,"Public health and local emergency ethics: vulnerability in Eastern Samar, Philippines",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected maternal and infant health globally both directly from infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and indirectly from changes in health care resulting from social, economic, and health care policies unique to each country. The developing countries have to share the disproportionate burden on maternal and infant health. In this review, we discuss the uncertainties resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, vertical transmission of the virus, and its effects on breastfeeding of the newborn. The problems of families and communities caring for mothers with COVID-19 and its impact on breastfeeding in newborns are discussed. The challenges posed by the pandemic have forced us to think and devise innovative solutions, including telemedicine help for antenatal counseling, breastfeeding education, and lactation support. Optimal utilization of resources and technology to find creative solutions at the individual and the community level will help in facilitating maternal–infant bonding soon after birth. Appropriate health care policies to support pregnant and lactating mothers will go a long way in meeting healthy child development goals.","Singh, Ajay Pratap Kumar Vasantha HS Panda Sanjeet",Pediatric Reports,,369
246938,Reply to: Singularities of AED implementation in occupational setting and COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the medium-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on epilepsy patients, focusing on psychological effects and seizure control. METHODS: Prospective follow-up study to evaluate the medium-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on a cohort of epilepsy patients from a tertiary hospital previously surveyed during the first peak of the pandemic. Between July 1, 2020, and August 30, 2020, the patients answered an online 19-item questionnaire, HADS, and PSIQ scales. Short- and medium-term effects of the pandemic confinement and the perception of telemedicine were compared. RESULTS: 153 patients completed the questionnaire, mean ± SD age, 47.6 ± 19.3 years; 49.7% women. Depression was reported by 43 patients, significantly more prevalent than in the short-term analysis (29.2% vs. 19.7%; p = .038). Anxiety (38.1% vs. 36.1%; p = 0.749) and insomnia (28.9% vs. 30.9%, p = .761) remained highly prevalent. Seventeen patients reported an increase in seizure frequency (11.1% vs. 9.1%, p = .515). The three factors independently associated with an increase in seizure frequency in the medium term were drug-resistant epilepsy (odds ratio [OR] = 8.2, 95% CI 2.06-32.52), depression (OR = 6.46, 95% CI 1.80-23.11), and a reduction in income (OR = 5.47, 95% CI 1.51-19.88). A higher proportion of patients found telemedicine unsatisfactory (11.2% vs. 2.4%), and a lower percentage (44.8% vs. 56.8%) found it very satisfactory (p = .005). CONCLUSIONS: Depression rates increased significantly after the first wave. Depression, drug-resistant epilepsy, and a reduction in family income were independent risk factors for an increased seizure frequency. Perception of telemedicine worsened, indicating need for re-adaptation.","Lallana, Sofía; Fonseca, Elena; Restrepo, Juan Luis; Quintana, Manuel; Seijo-Raposo, Iván; Abraira, Laura; Santamarina, Estevo; Álvarez-Sabín, José; Toledo, Manuel",Acta neurol. scand,,369

253237,"If fetuses are persons, abortion is a public health crisis",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the general population's life worldwide. People may spend more time on social media because of policies like ""work at home"". Using a cross-sectional dataset collected through an online survey in February 2020, in China, we examined (1) the relationships between social media activities and people's mental health status and (2) the moderation effect of emotional-regulation strategies. The sample included people aged &#8805;18 years from 32 provinces and regions in China (N = 3159). The inferential analyses included a set of multiple linear regressions with interactions. Our results showed that sharing timely, accurate, and positive COVID-19 information, reducing excessive discussions on COVID-19, and promoting caring online interactions rather than being judgmental, might positively associate with the general public's psychological well-being. Additionally, the relationships between social media activities and psychological well-being varied at different emotion-regulation strategy levels. Adopting the cognitive reappraisal strategy might allay the adverse relationships between certain social media activities and mental health indicators. Our findings expanded the theory of how social media activities can be associated with a human being's mental health and how it can interact with emotion-regulation strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yang, Yang; Liu, Keqiao; Li, Siqi; Shu, Man",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,369
257824,GPS Trajectory-Based Spatio-Temporal Variations of Traffic Accessibility under Public Health Emergency Consideration,2021,"AIM: Our aim was to describe the clinical features of mothers infected with COVID-19 and examine any potential vertical mother to newborn transmission. We also assessed how effective the discharge recommendations were in preventing transmission during the first month of life. METHODS: This multicentre descriptive study involved 16 Spanish hospitals. We reviewed the medical records of 42 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 13, 2020, to March 29, 2020, when they were in their third trimester of pregnancy. They and their newborn infants were monitored until the infant was 1 month old. RESULTS: Over half (52.4%) of the women had a vaginal delivery. The initial clinical symptoms were coughing (66.6%) and fever (59.5%), and one mother died due to thrombo-embolic events. We admitted 37 newborn infants to the neonatal unit (88%), and 28 were then admitted to intermediate care for organisational virus-related reasons. No infants died, and no vertical transmission was detected during hospitalisation or follow-up. Only six were exclusively breastfed at discharge. CONCLUSION: There was no evidence of COVID-19 transmission in any of the infants born to COVID-19 mothers, and the post-discharge advice seemed effective. The measures to avoid transmission appeared to reduce exclusive breastfeeding at discharge.","Marín Gabriel, Miguel A; Cuadrado, Irene; Álvarez Fernández, Blanca; González Carrasco, Ersilia; Alonso Díaz, Clara; Llana Martín, Isabel; Sánchez, Laura; Olivas, Cristina; de Las Heras, Susana; Criado, Enrique",Acta paediatr. scand,,369
258795,How prepared is Africa to face COVID-19?,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate variations in nurses' sleep quality and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to evaluate whether the presence of potential risk factors influenced these symptoms over time. METHODS: This prospective cohort study surveyed nurses three times - surveying personal factors, working conditions, family dynamics, and attitude towards COVID-19 - between March 31 and May 4, 2020. Nurses' mental health was assessed through Depression Anxiety Stress Scales - short version (DASS-21); their sleep quality was assessed through a 5-point Likert scale question. RESULTS: Nurses' sleep quality and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress presented a positive variation over the COVID-19 outbreak. The only factors which are directly related to the COVID-19 outbreak and that were associated with the positive variation in nurses' symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were the fear to infect others and the fear to be infected (higher fear of being infected or to infect someone corresponded to increased symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress). CONCLUSIONS: Although the COVID-19 outbreak seems to have had an immediate impact on nurses' mental health, a psychological adaptation phenomenon was also observed. Future research should focus on assessing nurses' symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, after the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to compare and contrast the findings with the results of our study.","Sampaio, Francisco; Sequeira, Carlos; Teixeira, Laetitia",Environ Res,,369

The secondary objective is to investigate the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone 20 mg versus dexamethasone 6 mg. The exploratory objective of this study is to assess long-term consequences on mortality and quality of life at 180 and 360 days. TRIAL DESIGN: REMED is a prospective, phase II, open-label, randomised controlled trial testing superiority of dexamethasone 20 mg vs 6 mg. The trial aims to be pragmatic, i.e. designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in conditions that are close to real-life routine clinical practice. PARTICIPANTS: The study is multi-centre and will be conducted in the intensive care units (ICUs) of ten university hospitals in the Czech Republic. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Subjects will be eligible for the trial if they meet all of the following criteria: 1. Adult (&#8805;18 years of age) at time of enrolment; 2. Present COVID-19 (infection confirmed by RT-PCR or antigen testing); 3. Intubation/mechanical ventilation or ongoing high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy; 4. Moderate or severe ARDS according to Berlin criteria: â¢ Moderate - PaO2/FiO2 100-200 mmHg; â¢ Severe - PaO2/FiO2 < 100 mmHg; 5. Admission to ICU in the last 24 hours. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Subjects will not be eligible for the trial if they meet any of the following criteria: 1. Known allergy/hypersensitivity to dexamethasone or excipients of the investigational medicinal product (e.g. parabens, benzyl alcohol); 2. Fulfilled criteria for ARDS for &#8805;14 days at enrolment; 3. Pregnancy or breastfeeding; 4. Unwillingness to comply with contraception measurements from enrolment until at least 1 week after the last dose of dexamethasone (sexual abstinence is considered an adequate contraception method); 5. End-of-life decision or patient is expected to die within next 24 hours; 6. Decision not to intubate or ceilings of care in place; 7. Immunosuppression and/or immunosuppressive drugs in medical history: a) Systemic immunosuppressive drugs or chemotherapy in the past 30 days; b) Systemic corticosteroid use before hospitalization; c) Any dose of dexamethasone during the present hospital stay for COVID-19 for &#8805;5 days before enrolment; d) Systemic corticosteroids during present hospital stay for conditions other than COVID-19 (e.g. septic shock); 8. Current haematological or generalized solid malignancy; 9. Any contraindication for corticosteroid administration, e.g. â¢ intractable hyperglycaemia; â¢ active gastrointestinal bleeding; â¢ adrenal gland disorders; â¢ presence of superinfection diagnosed with locally established clinical and laboratory criteria without adequate antimicrobial treatment; 10. Cardiac arrest before ICU admission; 11. Participation in another interventional trial in the last 30 days. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Dexamethasone solution for injection/infusion is the investigational medicinal product as well as the comparator. The trial will assess two doses, 20 mg (investigational) vs 6 mg (comparator). Patients in the intervention group will receive dexamethasone 20 mg intravenously once daily on day 1-5, followed by dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously once daily on day 6-10. Patients in the control group will receive dexamethasone 6 mg day 1-10. All authorized medicinal products containing dexamethasone in the form of solution for i.v. injection/infusion can be used. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary endpoint: Number of ventilator-free days (VFDs) at 28 days after randomisation, defined as being alive and free from mechanical ventilation. SECONDARY ENDPOINTS: a) Mortality from any cause at 60 days after randomisation; b) Dynamics of inflammatory marker (C-Reactive Protein, CRP) change from Day 1 to Day 14; c) WHO Clinical Progression Scale at Day 14; d) Adverse events related to corticosteroids (new infections, new thrombotic complications) until Day 28 or hospital discharge; e) Independence at 90 days after randomisation assessed by Barthel Index. The long-term outcomes of this study are to assess long-term consequences on mortality and quality of life at 180 and 360 days through telephone structured interviews using the Barthel Index. RANDOMISATION: Randomisation will be carried out within the electronic case report form (eCRF) by the stratified permuted block randomisation method. Allocation sequences will be prepared by a statistician independent of the study team. Allocation to the treatment arm of an individual patient will not be available to the investigators before completion of the whole randomisation process. The following stratification factors will be applied: â¢ Age <65 and &#8805; 65; â¢ Charlson Comorbidity index (CCI) <3 and &#8805;3; â¢ CRP <150 mg/L and &#8805;150 mg/L â¢ Trial centre.

We have used special mRNA-architecture and formulation that provides suitable response of the product. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) data with spike protein (S) revealed that immunization generated specific antibody pools against the whole extracellular domain (RBD and S2) of the spike protein. The anti-sera and purified IgGs from immunized mice neutralized SARS-CoV-2-pseudoviruses in ACE2-expressing HEK293 cells in a dose dependent manner. Importantly, single-dose immunization protected mice-lungs from homotypic-pseudovirus entry and cytopathy. The immunologic responses have been implicated by a balanced and stable population of CD4+ cells with a Th1 bias.

274064,The Urgent Need for Public Health Preparedness Funding and Support,2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused wide dissemination across the world. Global health systems are facing the unprecedented challenges. Here we shared the experiences and lessons in emergency responses and management from our hospital, a government-assigned regional anti-Covid-19 general hospital in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. METHODS: Our periodic strategies in dealing with Covid-19 were described in detail. An administrative response including the establishment of Emergency Leadership Committee that was in full charge of management was established. Modifications of infrastructure including the Fever Clinic, inpatient ward, outpatient clinic and operation room were carried out. Special arrangements for outpatient services, hospitalization and surgeries were introduced. Medical personnel training and patient educations were performed. Initiations of Covid-19 researches and application of information technology were introduced. FINDINGS: Since January 16, three cases have been confirmed in our hospital and no healthcare-associated infection was found. During the epidemics, 6.46% staffs suffered depression, 9.87% had anxiety, and 98% were satisfied with the infection control policy. Shortages in staffs and medical consumables, and limitation in space were the obstacles we encountered. INTERPRETATION: As the cost of in-hospital transmission is unbearable, our experiences and lessons suggested that prompt actions should be taken immediately to decrease or eliminate potential in-hospital transmission. Experience shared herein may be useful for those facilities that are and may encounter Covid-19.","Shen, Yang; Cui, Ying; Li, Ning; Tian, Chen; Chen, Ming; Zhang, Ye-Wei; Huang, Ying-Zi; Chen, Hui; Kong, Qing-Fang; Zhang, Qun; Teng, Gao-Jun",Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol,,369

274486,6.A. Round table: Protecting borders and preparing for a pandemic: responses around the world to COVID19,2020,"In the previous publication ""Can atmospheric pollution be considered a co-factor in extremely high level of SARS-CoV-2 lethality in Northern Italy?"" Conticini et al. hypothesized that the surplus of lethality of the novel SARS-CoV-2 in Northern Italy may be at least in part explained by the evidence of highest pollution reported in this area, as both severe COVID-19 and smog exposure are correlated to an innate immune system hyper-activation with subsequent lung inflammation and injury. Since this hypothesis alone does not fully explain why specific subgroups of patients are at major risk, we hypothesized that obesity may be one of the links between COVID-19 severity and high level of air pollution. First, obesity is a predisposing factor for SARS-Cov-2 infection and worse COVID-19 outcomes, and unequivocal evidence demonstrated that fat mass excess is independently associated with several pulmonary diseases and lung inflammation. Moreover, it has been shown that obesity may intensify the detrimental effects of air pollution on the lungs, and this is not surprising if we consider that these conditions share an excessive activation of the immune system and a lung inflammatory infiltrate. Finally, fat mass excess has also been speculated to be itself a consequence of air pollutants exposure, which has been proved to induce metabolic disruption and weight gain in murine models. In conclusion, although many variables must be taken into account in the analysis of the pandemic, our observations suggest that obesity may act as effect modifier of smog-induced lung-injury, and the concomitant presence of these two factors could better explain the higher virulence, faster spread and greater mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern Italy compared to the rest of the country.","Lubrano, Carla; Risi, Renata; Masi, Davide; Gnessi, Lucio; Colao, Annamaria",Environ Pollut,,369

284406,The future of public health in England,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) presenting with pulmonary and extra-pulmonary manifestations. The first case was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has rapidly progressed to the form of a pandemic. The presentation is mild in about 80 percent of the cases, but the disease can also progress to a severe form of respiratory illness leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sometimes multi-organ failure, especially in people with other co-morbidities. Pregnant women also appear to be at a greater risk of acquiring a severe infection due to physiological changes during pregnancy. Many drugs with in vitro activity against the virus or an immunomodulatory effect have been considered for repurposing or have been tried as off-label drugs. The safety data regarding the use of newly approved or off-label or investigational drugs in pregnant women is limited and this poses a great challenge for clinicians. It is thus important to know the utility and safety of the medications to avoid untoward adverse effects on pregnant women and fetuses. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the approved, off-label, unlicensed, new and some promising medications for their use in the treatment of COVID-19 and the safety profile in pregnancy in an Indian scenario.","Manchanda, Kavita; Singh, Jasbir; Bhagat, Ranjeev; Tiwana, Ilmjot Kaur; Singh, Harmanjit",,,369

284801,China overhauls its public health bureaucracy,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently been identified as the causative agent for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The ability of this agent to be transmitted by blood transfusion has not been documented, although viral RNA has been detected in serum. Exposure to treatment with riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R + UV) reduces blood-borne pathogens while maintaining blood product quality. Here, we report on the efficacy of R + UV in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity when tested in human plasma and whole blood products. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-WA1/2020) was used to inoculate plasma and whole blood units that then underwent treatment with riboflavin and UV light (Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology System, Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO). The infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 in the samples before and after R + UV treatment were determined by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. Each plasma pool (n = 9) underwent R + UV treatment performed in triplicate using individual units of plasma and then repeated using individual whole blood donations (n = 3). RESULTS: Riboflavin and UV light reduced the infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 below the limit of detection for plasma products at 60-100% of the recommended energy dose. At the UV light dose recommended by the manufacturer, the mean log reductions in the viral titers were &#8805; 4.79 ± 0.15 Logs in plasma and 3.30 ± 0.26 in whole blood units. CONCLUSION: Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titer of SARS-CoV-2 to the limit of detection in human plasma and by 3.30 ± 0.26 on average in whole blood. Two clades of SARS-CoV-2 have been described and questions remain about whether exposure to one strain confers strong immunity to the other. Pathogen-reduced blood products may be a safer option for critically ill patients with COVID-19, particularly those in high-risk categories.","Ragan, Izabela; Hartson, Lindsay; Pidcoke, Heather; Bowen, Richard; Goodrich, Raymond",PLoS One,,369

The effect of decentralization in supply on the evolution of on-demand transit services is largely unknown. To this end, we propose a dynamic model comprising of the subsequent supply-side processes: (i) initial exposure to information about the platform, (ii) a long-term registration decision, and (iii) daily participation decisions, subject to day-to-day learning based on within-day matching outcomes. We construct a series of experiments to study the effect of supply market properties and pricing strategies. We find that labour supply in ridesourcing may be non-linear and undergo several transitions, inducing significant variations in income levels and level of service over time. Our results provide indications that the ridesourcing market may benefit from a cap in supply and regulation of the commission fee.","Ruijter, Arjan de; Cats, Oded; Kucharski, Rafal; Lint, Hans van",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06637v1.pdf,369

We assessed influenza surveillance sustainability in Africa where influenza activity varies and external funds for surveillance have decreased. METHODS: We surveyed African Network for Influenza Surveillance and Epidemiology (ANISE) countries about 2011-2017 surveillance system characteristics. Data were summarized with descriptive statistics and analyzed with univariate and multivariable analyses to quantify sustained or expanded influenza surveillance capacity in Africa. RESULTS: Eighteen (75%) of 24 ANISE members participated in the survey; their cumulative population of 710 751 471 represent 56% of Africa's total population. All 18 countries scored a mean 95% on WHO laboratory quality assurance panels. The number of samples collected from severe acute respiratory infection case-patients remained consistent between 2011 and 2017 (13 823 vs 13 674 respectively) but decreased by 12% for influenza-like illness case-patients (16 210 vs 14 477). Nine (50%) gained capacity to lineage-type influenza B. The number of countries reporting each week to WHO FluNet increased from 15 (83%) in 2011 to 17 (94%) in 2017. CONCLUSIONS: Despite declines in external surveillance funding, ANISE countries gained additional laboratory testing capacity and continued influenza testing and reporting to WHO. These gains represent important achievements toward sustainable surveillance and epidemic/pandemic preparedness.","Igboh, Ledor S; McMorrow, Meredith; Tempia, Stefano; Emukule, Gideon O; Talla Nzussouo, Ndahwouh; McCarron, Margaret; Williams, Thelma; Weatherspoon, Vashonia; Moen, Ann; Fawzi, Derrar; Njouom, Richard; Nakoune, Emmanuel; Dauoda, Coulibaly; Kavunga-Membo, Hugo; Okeyo, Mary; Heraud, Jean-Michel; Mambule, Ivan Kiggundu; Sow, Samba Ousmane; Tivane, Almiro; Lagare, Adamou; Adebayo, Adedeji; Dia, Ndongo; Mmbaga, Vida; Maman, Issaka; Lutwama, Julius; Simusika, Paul; Walaza, Sibongile; Mangtani, Punam; Nguipdop-Djomo, Patrick; Cohen, Cheryl; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,,369

311431,Challenges of ongoing Covid and Ebola epidemics amidst violence and other epidemics in DR Congo,2020,"BACKGROUND: To estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency inpatient volume in a tertiary eye care center in Germany with corneal main subspecialization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of ocular emergency patients who attended the inpatient unit of the Department of Ophthalmology of Saarland University, Homburg/Saar, Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic, between 1 March and 30 April 2020, in comparison to the same time period in 2019. For each subject, clinical history and surgical reports were reviewed. After 24 March 2020, PCR examinations for SARS-CoV-2 were performed from throat swab specimens in all patients using real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Totally, 135 patients were admitted in 2019 and 115 patients in 2020 as emergency cases. The patient age at the time of admission did not differ significantly between the two time periods (63.6 ± 17.9 years vs. 62.5 ± 19.6 years) (p = 0.792), but the average length of hospital stays increased significantly for 2020 (4.0 ± 3.6 vs. 4.4 ± 2.7 days, p = 0.043). The percentage of admissions due to acute corneal hydrops (0% vs. 3.5%) increased significantly from 2019 to 2020 (&#967;2 = 4.772, p = 0.028), however, there was not a significant difference between the two years for any other diagnosis (&#967;2 &#8804; 3.564, p &#8805; 0.059). From 2019 to 2020, the percentage of acute intravitreal anti-VEGF injections decreased significantly (7.9% vs. 1.3%, &#967;2 = 3.985, p = 0.045), but the proportion of other emergency surgeries did not differ between the two years (&#967;2 &#8804; 3.617, p &#8805; 0.057). COVID-19 PCR examination was performed in 66 (57.4%) cases in 2020 and all samples (100%) were negative. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID pandemic did not change emergency inpatient volume in our department, but duration of hospital stay was extended on average by 8 hours, mainly due to additional COVID-19-PCR examinations. The proportion of the most frequently performed surgeries did not change remarkably between 2019 and 2020, but with the introduction of Muraine's sutures in 2019, the percentage of admissions with acute corneal hydrops (with or without subsequent surgery) increased for 2020.

The segmented lesions can help to assess the severity of pneumonia and follow-up the patients. In this work, we propose a new multitask deep learning model to jointly identify COVID-19 patient and segment COVID-19 lesion from chest CT images. Three learning tasks: segmentation, classification and reconstruction are jointly performed with different datasets. Our motivation is on the one hand to leverage useful information contained in multiple related tasks to improve both segmentation and classification performances, and on the other hand to deal with the problems of small data because each task can have a relatively small dataset. Our architecture is composed of a common encoder for disentangled feature representation with three tasks, and two decoders and a multi-layer perceptron for reconstruction, segmentation and classification respectively. The proposed model is evaluated and compared with other image segmentation techniques using a dataset of 1369 patients including 449 patients with COVID-19, 425 normal ones, 98 with lung cancer and 397 of different kinds of pathology. The obtained results show very encouraging performance of our method with a dice coefficient higher than 0.88 for the segmentation and an area under the ROC curve higher than 97% for the classification.","Amyar, Amine; Modzelewski, Romain; Li, Hua; Ruan, Su",Comput Biol Med,,369

To enable real-time monitoring of the incidence of mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) - for which medical consultation might not be required - the Infectieradar web-based syndromic surveillance system was launched in mid-March 2020. Our aim was to quantify associations between Infectieradar participant characteristics and the incidence of self-reported COVID-19-like illness. Recruitment for this cohort study was via a web announcement. After registering, participants completed weekly questionnaires, reporting the occurrence of a set of symptoms. The incidence rate of COVID-19-like illness was estimated and multivariable Poisson regression used to estimate the relative risks associated with sociodemographic variables, lifestyle factors and pre-existing medical conditions. Between 17 March and 24 May 2020, 25 663 active participants were identified, who reported 7060 episodes of COVID-19-like illness over 131 404 person-weeks of follow-up. The incidence rate declined over the analysis period, consistent with the decline in notified cases. Male sex, age 65+ years and higher education were associated with a significantly lower COVID-19-like illness incidence rate (adjusted rate ratios (RRs) of 0.80 (95% CI 0.76-0.84), 0.77 (0.70-0.85), 0.84 (0.80-0.88), respectively) and the baseline characteristics ever-smoker, asthma, allergies, diabetes, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease and children in the household were associated with a higher incidence (RRs of 1.11 (1.04-1.19) to 1.69 (1.50-1.90)). Web-based syndromic surveillance has proven useful for monitoring the temporal trends in, and risk factors associated with, the incidence of mild disease. Increased relative risks observed for several patient factors could reflect a combination of exposure risk, susceptibility to infection and propensity to report symptoms.","McDonald, Scott A; van den Wijngaard, Cees C; Wielders, Cornelia C H; Friesema, Ingrid H M; Soetens, Loes; Paolotti, Daniela; van den Hof, Susan; van Hoek, Albert Jan",Epidemiol Infect,,369

The authors designed a formal needs assessment to assess medical learners' perspectives regarding distress related to disrupted training environments. This Rapid Communication describes findings from a qualitative study which defined medical learner wellness and validated five wellness domains.Approach: We conducted follow-up telephone interviews to an online needs assessment survey to identify a learner definition for wellness and to validate five wellness domains, including social, mental, physical, intellectual, and occupational wellness. Using purposive and maximal variation sampling, 27 students were interviewed from July-August 2020. Thematic analysis was performed using a deductive thematic approach to qualitative analysis.Outcomes: Medical learners defined wellness as a general [holistic] sense of personal well-being - the opportunity to be and to do what they most need and value. Learners validated all five wellness domains for medical education.

Our recent in vitro, and in vivo coronaviral pathogenesis studies involving Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV-A59) suggest a crucial role for a small host membrane-virus contact initiator region of the Spike protein, called the fusion peptide that enhances the virus fusogenicity and infectivity. Here I study the Spike from five human ß-coronaviruses (HCoV) including the SARS-CoV-2, and MHV-A59 for comparison. The structural and dynamics analyses of the Spike show that its fusion loop spatially organizes three fusion peptides contiguous to each other to synergistically trigger the virus-host membrane fusion process. I propose a Contact Initiation Model based on the architecture of the Spike quaternary structure that explains the obligatory participation of the fusion loop in the initiation of the host membrane contact for the virus fusion process. Among all the HCoV Spikes in this study, SARS-CoV-2 has the most hydrophobic surface and the extent of hydrophobicity correlates with the reproductive number and infectivity of the other HCoV. Comparison between results from standard and replica exchange molecular dynamics reveal the unique physicochemical properties of the SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptides, accrued in part from the presence of consecutive prolines that impart backbone rigidity which aids the virus fusogenicity. The priming of the Spike by its cleavage and subsequent fusogenic conformational transition steered by the fusion loop may be critical for the SARS-CoV-2 spread. The importance of the fusion loop makes it an apt target for anti-virals and vaccine candidates.","Pal, Debnath",J Struct Biol,,369

We employ a set of difference-in-differences (DID) estimations to disentangle the lockdown effect on human mobility reductions from other confounding effects including panic effect, virus effect, and the Spring Festival effect. We find that the lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflow into Wuhan by 76.64%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.35%, and within- Wuhan movements by 54.15%. We also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, on the destination cities' new infection cases. We find, using simulations with these estimates, that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of Wuhan, even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities. We find that the COVID-19 cases would be 64.81% higher in the 347 Chinese cities outside Hubei province, and 52.64% higher in the 16 non-Wuhan cities inside Hubei, in the counterfactual world in which the city of Wuhan were not locked down from January 23, 2020. We also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan and other cities of Hubei province, but over time, the gap between the officially reported cases and our estimated actual cases narrows significantly. We also find evidence that enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 Chinese cities outside Hubei province are effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in Hubei province on the spread of 2019-nCoV virus in the destination cities elsewhere.","Fang, HanMing Wang Long Yang Yang",Working Paper Series National Bureau of Economic Research,,369

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) targeting N protein is detectable in the serum of infected patients. The effect of high titers of IgG against N-protein on clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV2 disease has not been described. We studied 400 RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV2 patients to determine independent factors associated with poor outcomes, including Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) admission, prolonged MICU stay and hospital admissions, and in-hospital mortality. We also measured serum IgG against the N protein and correlated its concentrations with clinical outcomes. We found that several factors, including Charlson comorbidity Index (CCI), high levels of IL6, and presentation with dyspnea were associated with poor clinical outcomes. It was shown that higher CCI and higher IL6 levels were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Anti-N protein IgG was detected in the serum of 55 (55%) patients at the time of admission. A high concentration of antibodies, defined as signal to cut off ratio (S/Co) > 1.5 (75 percentile of all measurements), was found in 25 (25%) patients. The multivariable logistic regression models showed that between being an African American, higher CCI, lymphocyte counts, and S/Co ratio > 1.5, only S/Co ratio were independently associated with MICU admission and longer length of stay in hospital. This study recommends that titers of IgG targeting N-protein of SARS-CoV2 at admission is a prognostic factor for the clinical course of disease and should be measured in all patients with SARS-CoV2 infection.","Batra, Mayank; Tian, Runxia; Zhang, Chongxu; Clarence, Emile; Sacher, Camila Sofia; Miranda, Justin Nestor; De La Fuente, Justin Rafa O; Mathew, Megan; Green, Desmond; Patel, Sayari; Bastidas, Maria Virginia Perez; Haddadi, Sara; Murthi, Mukunthan; Gonzalez, Miguel Santiago; Kambali, Shweta; Santos, Kayo H M; Asif, Huda; Modarresi, Farzaneh; Faghihi, Mohammad; Mirsaeidi, Mehdi",Sci Rep,,369

399911,Perspectives of Popular Education in Health and its Thematic Group at the Brazilian Association of Public Health (ABRASCO),2020,"INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of coronavirus causing a pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-2). Coronaviruses are very diverting genetically and mutate so often periodically. The natural selection of viral mutations may cause host infection selectivity and infectivity. METHODS: This study was aimed to indicate the diversity between human and animal coronaviruses through finding the rate of mutation in each of the spike, nucleocapsid, envelope, and membrane proteins. RESULTS: The mutation rate is abundant in all 4 structural proteins. The most number of statistically significant amino acid mutations were found in spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) which may be because it is responsible for a corresponding receptor binding in a broad range of hosts and host selectivity to infect. Among 17 previously known amino acids which are important for binding of spike to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, all of them are conservative among human coronaviruses, but only 3 of them significantly are mutated in animal coronaviruses. A single amino acid aspartate-454, that causes dissociation of the RBD of the spike and ACE2, and F486 which gives the strength of binding with ACE2 remain intact in all coronaviruses. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Observations of this study provided evidence of the genetic diversity and rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other human and animal coronaviruses.","Dimonte, Salvatore; Babakir-Mina, Muhammed; Hama-Soor, Taib; Ali, Salar",Public Health Genomics,,369

METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis and a systematic review to examine the prevalence of aPL and its clinical impact in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: 21 studies with a total of 1159 patients were included in our meta-analysis. Among patients hospitalised with COVID-19, the pooled prevalence rate of one or more aPL (IgM or IgG or IgA of anticardiolipin (aCL) or anti-ß2 glycoprotein (anti-ß2 GPI) or antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin, or lupus anticoagulant (LA)) was 46.8% (95% CI 36.1% to 57.8%). The most frequent type of aPL found was LA, with pooled prevalence rate of 50.7% (95% CI 34.8% to 66.5%). Critically ill patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher prevalence of aCL (IgM or IgG) (28.8% vs 7.10%, p<0.0001) and anti-ß2 GPI (IgM or IgG) (12.0% vs 5.8%, p<0.0001) as compared with non-critically ill patients. However, there was no association between aPL positivity and mean levels of C reactive protein (mean difference was 32 (95% CI -15 to 79), p=0.18), D-dimer (mean difference was 34 (95% CI -194 to 273), p=0.77), mortality (1.46 (95% CI 0.29 to 7.29), p=0.65), invasive ventilation (1.22 (95% CI 0.51 to 2.91), p=0.65) and venous thromboembolism (1.38 (95% CI 0.57 to 3.37), p=0.48). CONCLUSIONS: aPLs were detected in nearly half of patients with COVID-19, and higher prevalence of aPL was found in severe disease. However, there was no association between aPL positivity and disease outcomes including thrombosis, invasive ventilation and mortality. However, further studies are required to identify the clinical and pathological role of aPL in COVID-19.","Taha, Muhanad; Samavati, Lobelia",,,369

However, considerable geographical disparities in the distribution of COVID-19 incidence existed among different cities. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of sociodemographic factors on COVID-19 incidence of 342 cities in China from a geographic perspective. METHODS: Official surveillance data about the COVID-19 and sociodemographic information in China's 342 cities were collected. Local geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) model and traditional generalized linear models (GLM) Poisson regression model were compared for optimal analysis. RESULTS: Compared to that of the GLM Poisson regression model, a significantly lower corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AICc) was reported in the GWPR model (61953.0 in GLM vs. 43218.9 in GWPR). Spatial auto-correlation of residuals was not found in the GWPR model (global Moran's I = - 0.005, p = 0.468), inferring the capture of the spatial auto-correlation by the GWPR model. Cities with a higher gross domestic product (GDP), limited health resources, and shorter distance to Wuhan, were at a higher risk for COVID-19. Furthermore, with the exception of some southeastern cities, as population density increased, the incidence of COVID-19 decreased.

432821,[Let's return to symbols],2020,"The frustrating interfacial issue between Li metal anode and solid electrolyte is the main obstacle that restricts the commercial promotion of solid-state batteries. The garnet-type ceramic electrolyte with high stability against metallic Li has drawn much attention, but it also suffers from huge interfacial resistance and Li dendrite penetration due to the unavoidable formation of the carbonate passivation layer and limited interface contact. Herein, we propose a facile and effective method of flame vapor deposition to spray candle soot (CS) coating on the garnet surface. It enables the reduction of the carbonate layer and the conversion to a highly lithiophilic interlayer especially when in contact with molten Li. The lithiophilicity is rooted in the enrichment of graphitic polycrystalline domains in CS, which can be chemically or electrochemically lithiated to form the ionic/electronic dual-conductive network containing LiC6 moieties. The CS interlayer binds the Li metal with the garnet electrolyte tightly with gradual transition of Li-ion conductivity, leading to a significant reduction of the area-specific resistance to 50 &#937; cm2 at 60 °C with high cycling and current endurance. Garnet-based symmetric cells and solid-state full cells conducting this strategy exhibit impressive electrochemical reversibility and durability under the preservation of the compact interface and smooth Li plating/stripping. The modified Li/garnet/FeF3 batteries exhibit a discharge capacity as high as 500 mA h g-1 and long-term cyclability for at least 1500 cycles (with capacity preserved at 281.7 and 201 mA h g-1 at 100 and 200 µA cm-2, respectively). This candle combustion strategy can be extended to more ceramic electrolytes compatible with high-temperature pretreatment.","Zhang, Yang; Meng, Junwei; Chen, Keyi; Wu, Qingping; Wu, Xiaoxue; Li, Chilin",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),,369

Such exposure to wound care on a plastic surgery placement in medical school may increase the confidence of junior doctors entering the hospital workplace. This is currently of particular importance due to the increased incidence of pressure ulcers requiring care which has occurred as a result of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

454472,Global Policy Surveillance and Legal Epidemiology: Next Steps?,2020,"After conducting a literature search, the purpose of this article has emerged. The essential elements of a homiletical praxis, interested in dealing with the gospel, are related to the concrete circumstances of listeners. Consequently, the feelings of angst or nothingness that listeners experience in a post-pandemic world are now integrated into the reflection of a homiletical praxis. A homiletical praxis should not fall into the trap of trying to discern the signs of the times in a one-sided manner and an over-simplifying way, but should rather help listeners to understand the essence of hope. The dimensions of yet and not yet, that enable listeners to understand the idea of hope against hope, could be functional in identifying the objective of this research. The research problem is as follows: What kind of practical theological perspectives could be delineated for a praxeology of preaching to offer insight to listeners experiencing angst and a feeling of nothingness within a post-pandemic world? The problem addressed in this article inevitably takes cognisance of the listeners’ experiences of reality caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. A profound quest for a homiletical praxis in which life is central has also emerged in the research. Eventually, this research indicates the contours for a praxis that views preaching with clairvoyant eyes for listeners’ concrete experiences. I discovered that preaching offers the opportunity to approach disorienting dilemmas that evoke intriguing self-reflection to answer the question: Where do we go from here? A homiletical praxeology, therefore, also has to deal with the experiences of listeners. To address this research question, the notion of critical correlation offers a methodological framework for operating within. It allows the researcher to set up a dialogue between questions related to the homiletical praxis on the one hand, and perspectives that come forth in reflecting the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic on the other. A second phase involves providing a theological perspective on God who can perform new deeds amidst the unusual. Deliberating on this will pave the way for a homiletical theory at the end of the article. Contribution: This article aims to engage with the basic tenet of preaching, viewed from a Reformational paradigm and wants to contribute towards a better understanding of a homiletical praxeology within a post-pandemic world.","Kruger, Ferdi P.",In die Skriflig,,369

465914,Addressing Vaccine Concerns: A Hopeful Path Forward for Vaccine Confidence,2021,"The viral particle, SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for causing the epidemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To combat this situation, numerous strategies are being thought for either creating its antidote, vaccine, or agents that can prevent its infection. For enabling research on these strategies, several target proteins are identified where, Spike (S) protein is of great potential. S-protein interacts with human angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2) for entering the cell. S-protein is a large protein and a portion of it designated as a receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the key region that interacts with ACE2, following to which the viral membrane fuses with the alveolar membrane to enter the human cell. The hypothesis is to identify molecules from the pool of anticancer phytochemicals as a lead possessing the ability to interact and mask the amino acids of RBD, making them unavailable to form associations with ACE2. Such a molecule is termed as 'fusion inhibitor'. We hypothesized to identify fusion inhibitors from the NPACT library of anticancer phytochemicals. For this, all the molecules from the NPACT were screened using molecular docking, the five top hits (Theaflavin, Ginkgetin, Ursolic acid, Silymarin and Spirosolane) were analyzed for essential Pharmacophore features and their ADMET profiles were studied following to which the best two hits were further analyzed for their interaction with RBD using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. Binding free energy calculations were performed using MM/GBSA, proving these phytochemicals containing anticancer properties to serve as fusion inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

469773,10.A. Workshop: COVID19 immunisation passports – A golden solution or the golden apple of discord?,2020,"As the world grapples with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a particularly thorny set of questions surrounds the reopening of primary and secondary (K-12) schools. The benefits of in-person learning are numerous, in terms of education quality, mental health, emotional well-being, equity and access to food and shelter. Early reports suggested that children might have reduced susceptibility to COVID-19, and children have been shown to experience fewer complications than older adults. Over the past few months, our understanding of COVID-19 has been further shaped by emerging data, and it is now understood that children are as susceptible to infection as adults and have a similar viral load during infection, even if asymptomatic. Based on this updated understanding of the disease, we have used epidemiological modeling to explore the feasibility and consequences of school reopening in the face of differing rates of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission. We focused our analysis on the United States, but the results are applicable to other countries as well. We demonstrate the potential for a large discrepancy between detected cases and true infections in schools due to the combination of high asymptomatic rates in children coupled with delays in seeking testing and receiving results from diagnostic tests. Our findings indicate that, regardless of the initial prevalence of the disease, and in the absence of robust surveillance testing and contact-tracing, most schools in the United States can expect to remain open for 20-60 days without the emergence of sizeable disease clusters. At this point, even if schools choose to close after outbreaks occur, COVID-19 cases will be seeded from these school clusters and amplified into the community. Thus, our findings suggest that the debate between the risks to student safety and benefits of in-person learning frames a false dual choice. Reopening schools without surveillance testing and contact tracing measures in place will lead to spread within the schools and within the communities that eventually forces a return to remote learning and leaves a trail of infection in its wake.","Johnson, Kaitlyn E; Stoddard, Madison; Nolan, Ryan P; White, Douglas E; Hochberg, Natasha S; Chakravarty, Arijit",PLoS One,,369

Association of VLCFA with various cardiovascular risk factors were evaluated. METHOD: Fasting blood samples were collected from 541 human volunteers (242 men and 299 women; mean age Â±SD, 58.9 Â±12.4 years), including 429 and 112 individuals with and without hypertriglyceridemia, respectively. Esterified VLCFA were saponified and derivatized with 2-nitrophenylhydrazine. Separation of VLCFA species was achieved with C4 Mightysil column (HPLC) and Ascentis Express Phenyl-Hexyl column (LC-MS) followed by spectrophotometric and selected-reaction monitoring mode of mass spectrometric detection, respectively. RESULTS: The HPLC assay of VLCFA was precise with intra-assay imprecision of 2.5% to 6.9% and inter-assay imprecision of 3.2% to 9.5%. Moreover, there was an excellent correlation (r > 0.96) between HPLC and LC-MS methods. The 95 percentile reference intervals (RI; upper limit) of VLCFA was determined to be 41.3 Î»mol/L in healthy volunteers. Plasma VLCFA were significantly correlated with triglycerides (Spearmanâs ï²=0.306, p<0.001) and total cholesterol (Spearmanâs ï²=0.251, p<0.001). All species of VLCFA were significantly elevated in hypertriglyceridemic individuals compared to control. CONCLUSION: We established LC-based assays of VLCFA with either spectrophotometry or mass spectrometry as a detection system. Hypertriglyceridemia is significantly associated with elevated concentration of each species of VLCFA.","Shrestha, Rojeet; Chen, Zhen; Gao, Zijun; Chen, Yifan; Okada, Emiko; Ukawa, Shigekazu; Nakagawa, Takafumi; Nakamura, Koshi; Tamakoshi, Akiko; Chiba, Hitoshi; Hui, Shu-Ping",Ann Clin Biochem,,369

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had widespread implications for primary health care nurses. Supporting these nurses' capacity to deliver quality care ensures that ongoing health needs can be met. METHODS: Primary health care nurses were recruited to an online survey via social media and professional organisations in April 2020. RESULTS: Six-hundred and thirty-seven responses were included in the analysis. Participants provided 1,213 statements about perceived supports required to provide quality clinical care. From these, seven key categories emerged, namely personal protective equipment, communication, funding, industrial issues, self-care, workplace factors and valuing nurses. CONCLUSION: A number of key issues relating to personal health and safety, care quality and job security need to be addressed to support primary health care nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing these support issues can assist in retaining nurses and optimizing the role of primary health care nurses during a pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Responding to the needs of primary health care nurses has the potential to facilitate their role in providing community-based health care. This knowledge can guide the provision of support for primary health care nurses during the current pandemic, as well as informing planning for future health crises across the health service.","Halcomb, Elizabeth; Williams, Anna; Ashley, Christine; McInnes, Susan; Stephen, Catherine; Calma, Kaara; James, Sharon",J. nurs. manag,,369

Thematic analysis identified the body-of-the-therapist and client as they exist (and are obstructed) due to technology for creating barriers and opportunities in translating CFT intervention to telehealth platforms. Relational teletherapy cultivated therapist creativity and exhaustion. It also made plain the need for systemic interventions with children and adolescents that engages their parents and home environments.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for delirium in older patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as well as its association with length of stay and mortality. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients aged &#8805; 65 years hospitalized with COVID-19. Data were collected from computerized medical records and all patients had delirium assessment at admission. Risk factors for delirium as well as the outcomes mentioned above were studied by two-group comparison, logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazard models. RESULTS: Of a total of 235 Caucasian patients, 48 (20.4%) presented with delirium, which was hypoactive in 41.6% of cases, hyperactive and mixed in 35.4% and 23.0%, respectively. Patients with cognitive impairment had a nearly four times higher risk of developing delirium compared to patients that were cognitively normal before SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 3.7; 1.7-7.9 95% CI, p=0.001). The presence of delirium did not modify the time from symptoms' onset to hospitalization nor the length of stay in acute care, but it was associated with an increased risk of dying (HR 2.1; 1.2-3.7 95%CI; p=0.0113). CONCLUSION: Delirium was a prevalent condition in older people admitted with COVID-19 and pre-existing cognitive impairment was its main risk factor. Delirium was associated with higher in-hospital mortality. These results highlight the importance of early recognition of delirium especially when pre-morbid cognitive comorbidities are present.","Mendes, Aline; Herrmann, François R; Périvier, Samuel; Gold, Gabriel; Graf, Christophe E; Zekry, Dina","J. gerontol.

Survival to hospital discharge increased over time, from 60.0% in the first 2 weeks of the study period to 67.6% in the last 2 weeks. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, the risk-adjusted odds of survival to hospital discharge increased over time (biweekly change, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.22, 95% CI 1.04-1.40, P = 0.02). Additionally, an a priori-defined explanatory model showed that after adjusting for both hospital occupancy and percent hospital capacity by COVID-19-positive individuals and persons under investigation (PUI), the temporal trend in risk-adjusted patient survival to hospital discharge remained the same (biweekly change, aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.38, P = 0.04). The presence of greater rates of COVID-19 positive/PUI as a percentage of hospital capacity was, however, significantly and inversely associated with survival to hospital discharge (aOR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.98, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: During the early COVID-19 pandemic, risk-adjusted survival to hospital discharge increased over time for critical care patients. An association was also seen between a greater COVID-19-positive/PUI percentage of hospital capacity and a lower survival rate to hospital discharge.","Dale, Christopher R; Starcher, Rachael W; Chang, Shu Ching; Robicsek, Ari; Parsons, Guilford; Goldman, Jason D; Vovan, Andre; Hotchkin, David; Gluckman, Tyler J",Crit Care,,369

524172,On Being a Former Student Editor in the Midst of a Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that human milk from mothers who have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) contains antibodies against the virus, which could play an important role in protecting the recipient infant against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Seroconversion is measured frequently around the world, but the milk conversion rate is unknown. RESEARCH AIMS: To determine (1) the prevalence and (2) the dynamics of immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human milk amongst lactating mothers in the Netherlands. METHODS: In this large prospective cohort study, lactating mothers (N = 2312) were included between October 12, 2020 and February 24, 2021. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine levels of IgA antibodies in human milk and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in serum against the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. RESULTS: A total of 691 (30.6%) participants had SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in human milk and/or serum. Of these participants, 524 (23.1%) had IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human milk, and 356 (15.7%) had IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum. A total of 199 (8.8%) participants had antibodies in both human milk and serum. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA antibodies in human milk remain present at least 10 months after a polymerase chain reaction confirmed infection. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human milk was 23.1% in our cohort. This high prevalence of antibodies in human milk might lead to passive immunity in many breastfed infants and may serve as protection against COVID-19.","Juncker, Hannah G; Romijn, Michelle; Loth, Veerle N; Ruhé, Eliza J M; Bakker, Sjors; Kleinendorst, Saskia; de Groot, Christianne J M; Pajkrt, Dasja; Korosi, Aniko; van Goudoever, Johannes B; van Gils, Marit J; van Keulen, Britt J",J Hum Lact,,369

METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design with a sample of 373 territorial army soldiers ages 18–55 who had not previously suffered from COVID-19 and were not convalescents. The symptoms prevalence data was collected using the standardized Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. OPA and LTPA data was collected using the Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall (SDPAR). RESULTS: The OPA, LTPA, and total physical activity (PA) among the studied soldiers was very diverse and the mean level of PA was relatively high. A total of 56 and 40% of territorial army soldiers had experienced pain or other discomfort in one or more of nine body regions during the past 12 months and during the past 7 days, respectively. The most common MSD among Polish territorial army soldiers were low back pain, followed by pain in the neck and knees. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that the OPA of the studied soldiers, especially vigorous-intensity and high vigorous-intensity OPA, was associated with a higher prevalence of MSD in several regions of the body, i.e. the lower back, elbows, wrists or hands, hips or thighs, and ankles or feet. Along with the increase in energy expenditure on total PA, a greater percentage of respondents experienced low back pain. Vigorous and high vigorous-intensity PA may contribute to the occurrence of MSD.","Grabara, Małgorzata; Sadowska-Krępa, Ewa",BMC Musculoskelet Disord,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-021-04654-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34530794/,369
619333,National Methodological Guidelines to Conduct Budget Impact Analysis for Health Technology Assessment in India,2021-06-29,"BACKGROUND: As malaria endemic countries strive towards elimination, intensified spatial heterogeneities of local transmission could undermine the effectiveness of traditional intervention policy. METHODS: The dynamic nature of large-scale and long-term malaria heterogeneity across Brazilian Amazon basin were explored by (1) exploratory analysis of Brazil’s rich clinical malaria reporting database from 2004 to 2018, and (2) adapting Gini coefficient to study the distribution of malaria cases in the region. RESULTS: As transmission declined, heterogeneity increased with cases clustering into smaller subpopulations across the territory. In 2004, the 1% of health units with the greatest number of cases accounted for 46% of all reported Plasmodium vivax cases, whereas in 2018 52% of P. vivax cases occurred in the top 1% of health units. Plasmodium falciparum had lower levels of transmission than P. vivax, and also had greater levels of heterogeneity with 75% of cases occurring in the top 1% of health units. Age and gender stratification of cases revealed peri-domestic and occupational exposure settings that remained relatively stable. CONCLUSION: The pathway to decreasing incidence is characterized by higher proportions of cases in males, in adults, due to importation, and caused by P. vivax. Characterization of spatio-temporal heterogeneity and risk groups can aid stratification for improved malaria control towards elimination with increased heterogeneity potentially allowing for more efficient and cost-effective targeting. Although distinct epidemiological phenomena were clearly observed as malaria transmission declines, the authors argue that there is no canonical path to malaria elimination and a more targeted and dynamic surveillance will be needed if Brazil decides to adopt the elimination target.","Lana, Raquel; Nekkab, Narimane; Siqueira, Andre M.; Peterka, Cassio; Marchesini, Paola; Lacerda, Marcus; Mueller, Ivo; White, Michael; Villela, Daniel",Malar J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12936-021-03614-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33579298/,369

Their ability to be agile and adaptive has been stressed, particularly in regard to the timing of policy measures, the level of decision centralization, the autonomy of decisions and the balance between change and stability. In this contribution we use our observations of responses to COVID-19 to reflect on agility and adaptive governance and provide tools to evaluate it after the dust has settled. Whereas agility relates mainly to the speed of response within given structures, adaptivity implies system-level changes throughout government. Existing institutional structures and tools can enable adaptivity and agility, which can be complimentary approaches. However, agility sometimes conflicts with adaptability. Our analysis points to the paradoxical nature of adaptive governance. Indeed, successful adaptive governance calls for both decision speed and sound analysis, for both centralized and decentralized decision-making, for both innovation and bureaucracy, and both science and politics.","Janssen, Marijn; van der Voort, Haiko",Int J Inf Manage,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0268401220309944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836637/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401220309944; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102180,369

632438,"Law, and Public Health Policy",2008-08-26,"Bats are highly diverse and ecologically important mammals. They harbor various bacteria, viruses, and fungal communities that are either beneficial or potentially pathogenic. Extensive metagenomic studies in bats are limited, particularly for the gut, and to date, there are no reports on the bacterial diversity of Rhinolophus monoceros from Meghalaya, India. There are limited studies on the isolation of potential harmful or beneficial bacteria and their interactions with the environment through culture-dependent approaches. Therefore, high-throughput screening was used to understand the population structure, genetic diversity, and ecological role of the microorganisms. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA marker for gene mapping showed that the gut samples constitute a diverse group of bacteria that is dominated by Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes. The bacterial genera Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium were also observed in the Illumina dataset. Illumina sequencing revealed eight bacterial phyla composed of 112 genera. The metagenomic analysis of the OTUs from the gut revealed diverse bacterial communities as well as zoonotic and human pathogens. There were differences in the bacterial communities between the two methods used in this study, which could be related to host specificity, diet, and habitat. The culture-dependent technique resulted in the isolation of 35 bacterial isolates, of which Bacillus cereus and B. anthracis are well-known bacterial pathogens that show virulent traits including hemolytic and proteolytic activities. Pseudomonas stutzeri is an opportunistic human pathogen that was also isolated and showed similar traits. Antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed on all 35 isolates, and different antibiotics were used for Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The result showed that some isolates are resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin G and Cefoxitin. This report on gut bacterial communities could attract interest in the possibility of isolating and characterizing bacteria for the production of antibiotics, enzymes, plant growth promoters, and probiotics. However, the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria that may impose health hazards cannot be ignored and needs to be studied further.","Selvin, Joseph; Lanong, Sheryl; Syiem, Donkupar; De Mandal, Surajit; Kayang, Highland; Kumar, Nachimuthu Senthil; Kiran, G.

This paper studies the example of China, the main country affected by the virus in the early stage of the pandemic, to explain the problems regarding the differences in time, knowledge, and technology for information transmission. This paper also tries to explain the causes behind the dissemination of rumors, misjudgment of the public, and the difficulties of perception regarding pandemic information based on the three aspects of information collection, processing, and presentation. We argue that comprehensive information transmission with direct and clear visual presentation could help the public better understand the development of the pandemic, relieve social panic, and help authorities promptly adjust public health policies to absorb the social and economic impacts of the pandemic.

641615,The amazing numbers of the World Congress on Public Health,2021-04-20,"Accurate modeling provides a means by which a complex problem can be examined for informed decision-making. We present a particle-based SEIR epidemic simulator as a tool to assess the impact of vaccination strategies on viral propagation and to model both sterilizing and effective immunization outcomes. The simulator includes modules to support contact tracing of the interactions amongst individuals as well as epidemiological testing of the general population. The simulator particles are distinguished by age, thus enabling a more accurate representation of the rates of infection and mortality in accordance with differential demographic susceptibilities and medical outcomes. Moreover, based on the age differentiation of particles the vaccination can be simulated based on the age group descending order or randomly across all age groups. The simulator can be calibrated by region of interest and variable vaccination strategies (i.e. random or prioritized by age) so as to enable locality-sensitive virus mitigation policy measures and resource allocation. The results described, based on the experience of the province of Lecco, Italy, indicate that the tool can be used to evaluate vaccination strategies in a way that incorporates local circumstances of viral propagation and demographic susceptibilities. Further, the simulator accounts for modeling the distinction between sterilizing immunization, in which immunized people are no longer contagious, and that of effective immunization, in which symptoms and mortality outcomes are diminished but individuals can still transmit the virus. The sterilizing-age-based vaccination scenario results in the least number of deaths compared to other scenarios. Furthermore, sterilizing immunity shows that random-all vaccination still results in a much smaller number of deaths across age groups 7-9 (ages 70 and above, i.e. age groups with the highest mortality rate) compared to the effective immunization scenario due to the herd immunity that stops further transmission of infection. As the vaccination rate increases, the mortality gap between the scenarios shrinks.","Karabay, Aknur; Kuzdeuov, Askat; Ospanova, Shyryn; Lewis, Michael; Varol, Huseyin Atakan",IEEE j. biomed. health inform.

Generalized linear models (GLM), a typical choice for ecological modeling, have well-established limitations. These limitations include apriori assumptions, inability to handle multicollinearity, and considering differential effects as the fixed effect. We propose an Ensemble-based Dynamic Emission Model (EDEM) to address these limitations. EDEM is developed at the intersection of network science and ensemble learning, i.e., a specialized approach of machine learning. Generalized Additive Model (GAM), i.e., a variant of GLM, and EDEM are tested in Los Angeles and Ventura counties of California, which is one of the biggest SARS-CoV-2 clusters in the US. GAM depicts that a 1 μg/m(3), 1 μg/m(3), and 1 ppm increase (lag 0–7) in PM 2.5, PM 10, and O3 is associated with 4.51% (CI: 7.01 to −2.00) decrease, 1.62% (CI: 2.23 to −1.022) decrease, and 4.66% (CI: 0.85 to 8.47) increase in daily SARS-CoV-2 cases, respectively. Subsequent increment in lag resulted in the negative association between pollutants and SARS-CoV-2 cases. EDEM results in an R2 score of 90.96% and 79.16% on training and testing datasets, respectively. EDEM confirmed the negative association between particulates and SARS-CoV-2 cases; whereas, the O3 depicts a positive association; however, the positive association observed through GAM is not statistically significant. In addition, the county-level analysis of pollutant concentration interactions suggests that increased emissions from other counties positively affect SARS-CoV-2 cases in adjoining counties as well.

Reflecting their high mutation rates, occurrences of target oligonucleotides evidently fluctuate in viral populations and often disappear. Time-series analysis of the one-base changed sequences derived from each original target identified the oligonucleotide that shows a compensatory increase and will potentially become the ‘awaiting-type oligonucleotide’ the combined use of this oligonucleotide with the original can provide therapeutics with long utility.

The study aimed to assess and compare the effectiveness of consultations, that is, telephone, video, and face-to-face (F2F) in a shoulder and elbow clinic. Methods: A total of 84 clinic letters from a shoulder and elbow clinic at a district general hospital were analysed using the Ashford Clinic Letter Scoring System. Of these, 30 were F2F, 30 were telephone, and 24 were video consultations. The letters were analysed and scored based on four parameters, that is, whether a working diagnosis was formulated, relevant investigations were requested or available, a clear management plan was formulated, and whether the consultation was deemed valuable by both the clinician and patient. Results: The mean score (out of a total possible of eight) for F2F was 7.967, 7.667 for video, and 7.333 for telephone consultations. Amongst new referrals, F2F performed the best, followed by video with telephone consultations scoring the lowest. With follow-up referrals, the performance of telephone and video consultations was similar but more inferior compared to F2F. Videos performed nearly as well as F2F when it came to formulating treatment plans for patients. Conclusion: F2F consultations remain the gold standard in a shoulder and elbow clinic; however, careful stratification of patients into video, telephone, and F2F clinics can help in optimal delivery of care. These findings can be applied to other surgical specialties and medicine in general. Virtual clinics are viable and potentially cost-effective options to the traditional F2F.","Sibanda, Vusumuzi; Onubogu, Ifeanyi; Raad, Marjan; Virani, Siddharth; Relwani, Jai",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34584790/,369

This study aims to test whether the number of inbound overseas travelers and meteorological conditions are associated with the onset week of HRSV epidemic season. The estimation of onset week for 46 prefectures (except for Okinawa prefecture) in Japan for 4-year period (2014–2017) was obtained from previous papers based on the national surveillance data. We obtained data on the yearly number of inbound overseas travelers and meteorological (yearly mean temperature and relative humidity) conditions from Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO) and Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), respectively. Multi-level mixed-effects linear regression analysis showed that every 1 person (per 100,000 population) increase in number of overall inbound overseas travelers led to an earlier onset week of HRSV epidemic season in the year by 0.02 week (coefficient –0.02; P<0.01). Higher mean temperature and higher relative humidity were also found to contribute to an earlier onset week by 0.30 week (coefficient –0.30; P<0.05) and 0.18 week (coefficient –0.18; P<0.01), respectively. Additionally, models that included the number of travelers from individual countries (Taiwan, South Korea, and China) except Australia showed that both the number of travelers from each country and meteorological conditions contributed to an earlier onset week. Our analysis showed the earlier onset week of HRSV epidemic season in Japan is associated with increased number of inbound overseas travelers, higher mean temperature, and relative humidity. The impact of international travelers on seasonality of HRSV can be further extended to investigations on the changes of various respiratory infectious diseases especially after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Wagatsuma, Keita; Koolhof, Iain S.; Shobugawa, Yugo; Saito, Reiko",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248932; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33765037/,369
687378,Building vaccine confidence through public participation,2021-05-21,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection continues to be transmitted to hemodialysis (HD) patients within HD facilities globally. The goal of the World Health Organization to micro-eliminate HCV infection from the HD population by the year 2030 is not on target to be achieved. Obstacles to eliminate HCV in HD settings remain daunting due to a complex system created by a confluence of guidelines, legislation, regulation, and economics. HCV prevalence remains high and seroconversion continues among the HD patient population globally as a result of the HD procedure. Preventive strategies that effectively prevent HCV transmission, treatment-as-prevention, and rapid referral to treatment balanced with kidney transplant candidacy should be added to the current universal precautions approach. A safer system must be designed before HCV transmission can be halted and eliminated from the HD population.","Rajasekaran, Arun; Franco, Ricardo A.; Overton, Edgar T.; McGuire, Brendan M.; Towns, Graham C.; Locke, Jayme E.; Sawinski, Deirdre L.; Bell, Emmy K.",Kidney Int Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ekir.2021.04.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34307975/,369

687745,Political Liberalism and Public Health,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 can cause a range of symptoms in infected individuals, from mild respiratory illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome. A systematic understanding of the host factors mediating viral infection or restriction is critical to elucidate SARS-CoV-2 host-pathogen interactions and the progression of COVID-19. To this end, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR knockout and activation screens in human lung epithelial cells with endogenous expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2. These screens uncovered proviral and antiviral host factors across highly interconnected host pathways, including components implicated in clathrin transport, inflammatory signaling, cell cycle regulation, and transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. We further identified mucins, a family of high-molecular weight glycoproteins, as a prominent viral restriction network. We demonstrate that multiple membrane-anchored mucins are critical inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 entry and are upregulated in response to viral infection. This functional landscape of SARS-CoV-2 host factors provides a physiologically relevant starting point for new host-directed therapeutics and suggests interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and airway mucins of COVID-19 patients as a host defense mechanism.","Biering, Scott B.; Sarnik, Sylvia A.; Wang, Eleanor; Zengel, James R.; Sathyan, Varun; Nguyenla, Xammy; Van Dis, Erik; Catamura, Carmelle; Yamashiro, Livia H.; Begeman, Adam; Stark, Jessica C.; Shon, D.
