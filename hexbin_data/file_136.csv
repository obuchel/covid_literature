289,"Optimism/pessimism and health-related quality of life during pregnancy across three continents: a matched cohort study in China, Ghana, and the United States",2009-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about how optimism/pessimism and health-related quality of life compare across cultures. METHODS: Three samples of pregnant women in their final trimester were recruited from China, Ghana, and the United States (U.S.). Participants completed a survey that included the Life Orientation Test - Revised (LOT-R, an optimism/pessimism measure), the Short Form 12 (SF-12, a quality of life measure), and questions addressing health and demographic factors. A three-country set was created for analysis by matching women on age, gestational age at enrollment, and number of previous pregnancies. Anovas with post-hoc pairwise comparisons were used to compare results across the cohorts. Multivariate regression analysis was used to create a model to identify those variables most strongly associated with optimism/pessimism. RESULTS: LOT-R scores varied significantly across cultures in these samples, with Ghanaian pregnant women being the most optimistic and least pessimistic and Chinese pregnant women being the least optimistic overall and the least pessimistic in subscale analysis. Four key variables predicted approximately 20% of the variance in overall optimism scores: country of origin (p = .006), working for money (p = .05); level of education (p = .002), and ever being treated for emotional issues with medication (p < .001). Quality of life scores also varied by country in these samples, with the most pronounced difference occurring in the vitality measure. U.S. pregnant women reported far lower vitality scores than both Chinese and Ghanaian pregnant women in our sample. CONCLUSION: This research raises important questions regarding what it is about country of origin that so strongly influences optimism/pessimism among pregnant women. Further research is warranted exploring underlying conceptualization of optimism/pessimism and health related quality of life across countries.","Moyer, Cheryl A; Yang, Huixia; Kwawukume, Yao; Gupta, Anu; Zhu, YuChun; Koranteng, Isaac; Elsayed, Yasmin; Wei, YuMei; Greene, Jonathan; Calhoun, Cecilia; Ekpo, Geraldine; Beems, Megan; Ryan, Megan; Adanu, Richard; Anderson, Frank",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2744663/,136
4455,"A cross-sectional study to characterize local HIV-1 dynamics in Washington, DC using next-generation sequencing",2020-02-06,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the major organelle in the cell for protein folding and plays an important role in cellular functions. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in response to misfolded or unfolded protein accumulation in the ER. However, the UPR successfully alleviates the ER stress. If UPR fails to restore ER homeostasis, apoptosis is induced. ER stress plays an important role in innate immune signaling in response to microorganisms. Dysregulation of UPR signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of a variety of infectious diseases. In this review, we summarize the contribution of ER stress to the innate immune response to invading microorganisms and its role in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases.","Choi, Ji-Ae; Song, Chang-Hwa",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7005066/,136
4579,"Compassion fatigue, watching patients suffering and emotional display rules among hospice professionals: a daily diary study",2020-02-25,"Tissue-resident memory T cells (T(RM) cells) are critical for cellular immunity to respiratory pathogens and reside in both the airways and the interstitium. In the present study, we found that the airway environment drove transcriptional and epigenetic changes that specifically regulated the cytolytic functions of airway T(RM) cells and promoted apoptosis due to amino acid starvation and activation of the integrated stress response. Comparison of airway T(RM) cells and splenic effector-memory T cells transferred into the airways indicated that the environment was necessary to activate these pathways, but did not induce T(RM) cell lineage reprogramming. Importantly, activation of the integrated stress response was reversed in airway T(RM) cells placed in a nutrient-rich environment. Our data defined the genetic programs of distinct lung T(RM) cell populations and show that local environmental cues altered airway T(RM) cells to limit cytolytic function and promote cell death, which ultimately leads to fewer T(RM) cells in the lung.","Hayward, Sarah L.; Scharer, Christopher D.; Cartwright, Emily K.; Takamura, Shiki; Li, Zheng-Rong Tiger; Boss, Jeremy M.; Kohlmeier, Jacob E.",Nat Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7044042/,136

11223,An intervention to decrease time to parents’ first hold of infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit requiring respiratory support,2020-01-07,"BACKGROUND: Acute brain lesions constitute an alarming public health concern. Neuroprotective therapies have been implemented to stabilize, prevent, or reduce brain lesions, thus improving neurological outcomes and survival rates. Hypothermia is the most effective approach, mainly attributed to the reduction in cellular metabolic activity. Whole-body cooling is currently implemented by healthcare professionals; however, adverse events are frequent, limiting the potential benefits of therapeutic hypothermia. Therefore, selective methods have been developed to reduce adverse events while delivering neuroprotection. Nasopharyngeal approaches are the safest and most effective methods currently considered. Our primary objective was to determine the effects of a novel nasopharyngeal catheter on the brain temperature of pigs. METHODS: In this prospective, non-randomized, interventional experimental trial, 10 crossbred pigs underwent nasopharyngeal cooling for 60 min followed by 15 min of rewarming. Nasopharyngeal catheters were inserted into the left nostril and properly positioned at the nasopharyngeal cavity. RESULTS: Nasopharyngeal cooling was associated with a decrease in brain temperature, which was more significant in the left cerebral hemisphere (p = 0.01). There was a reduction of 1.47 ± 0.86 °C in the first 5 min (p < 0.001), 2.45 ± 1.03 °C within 10 min (p < 0.001), and 4.45 ± 1.36 °C after 1 h (p < 0.001). The brain-core gradient was 4.57 ± 0.87 °C (p < 0.001). Rectal, esophageal, and pulmonary artery temperatures and brain and systemic hemodynamic parameters, remained stable during the procedure. Following brain cooling, values of oxygen partial pressure in brain tissue significantly decreased. No mucosal lesions were detected during nasal, pharyngeal, or oral inspection after nasopharyngeal catheter removal. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a novel nasopharyngeal cooling catheter effectively induced and maintained exclusive brain cooling when combined with effective counter-warming methods. Exclusive brain cooling was safe with no device-related local or systemic complications and may be desired in selected patient populations.","de Paiva, Bernardo Lembo Conde; Bor-Seng-Shu, Edson; Silva, Eliezer; Barreto, Ícaro Barros Miranda; de Lima Oliveira, Marcelo; Ferreira, Raphael Einsfeld Simões; Cavalcanti, Alexandre Biasi; Teixeira, Manoel Jacobsen",Neurocrit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223440/,136

Herein, we report the discovery of a conjugated dual-targeted molecule, compound 13, as the prototype mTOR/MEK bifunctional inhibitor. It exhibited moderately high inhibitory activity against mTOR and MEK1 with IC(50) values of 0.19 μM and 0.98 μM, respectively. In particular, it displayed attractive antiproliferative activity against both A549 (GI(50) = 4.66 μM) and HCT116 (GI(50) = 5.47 μM) cell lines. To our knowledge, it has been the first example of a conjugated mTOR/MEK bifunctional inhibitor. In addition, from this proof-of-principle study, it has become evident that the single-agent dual inhibition of mTOR and MEK can be fulfilled via covalently attaching mTOR kinase inhibitor to an allosteric MEK inhibitor.","Tao, Qiangqiang; Fang, Fang; Li, Jiaming; Wang, Yong; Zhao, Can; Liang, Jingtai; Ma, Xiaodong; Wang, Hao",Med Chem Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223898/,136
11601,Oral-Health-Related Quality of Life in Adult Patients with Rheumatic Diseases—A Systematic Review,2020-04-19,"Influenza B virus (IBV) is a respiratory pathogen that infects humans and causes seasonal influenza epidemics. However, cellular response to IBV infection in humans and mechanisms of host-mediated restriction of IBV replication are not thoroughly understood. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to perform transcriptome profiling of IBV-infected human lung epithelial A549 cells at 0, 6, 12, and 24 h post infection (hpi) and characterized the cellular gene expression dynamics. We observed that more than 4000 host genes were differentially regulated during the study period, which included up regulation of genes encoding proteins, having a role in the innate antiviral immune responses, immune activation, cellular metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis, as well as down regulation of genes involved in mitosis and cell proliferation. Further analysis of RNA-Seq data coupled with RT-qPCR validation collectively showed that double-strand RNA recognition pathways, including retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), were substantially activated following IBV infection. Taken together, these results provide important initial insights into the intimate interaction between IBV and lung epithelial cells, which can be further explored towards elucidation of the cellular mechanisms in restriction or elimination of IBV infections in humans.","Sheng, Zizhang; Huang, Chen; Liu, Runxia; Guo, Yicheng; Ran, Zhiguang; Li, Feng; Wang, Dan",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7232189/,136
14277,Study of Medicine: Lessons Learnt from International Medical Students Conference,2020-05-11,"The substantial rise in multidrug-resistant bacterial infections is a current global imperative. Cumulative efforts to characterize antimicrobial resistance in bacteria has demonstrated the spread of six families of multidrug efflux pumps, of which resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) is the major mechanism of multidrug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. RND is composed of a tripartite protein assembly and confers resistance to a range of unrelated compounds. In the major enteric pathogen Campylobacter jejuni, the three protein components of RND are posttranslationally modified with N-linked glycans. The direct role of N-linked glycans in C. jejuni and other bacteria has long been elusive. Here, we present the first detailed account of the role of N-linked glycans and the link between N-glycosylation and antimicrobial resistance in C. jejuni. We demonstrate the multifunctional role of N-linked glycans in enhancing protein thermostability, stabilizing protein complexes and the promotion of protein-protein interaction, thus mediating antimicrobial resistance via enhancing multidrug efflux pump activity. This affirms that glycosylation is critical for multidrug efflux pump assembly. We present a generalized strategy that could be used to investigate general glycosylation system in Campylobacter genus and a potential target to develop antimicrobials against multidrug-resistant pathogens.","Abouelhadid, Sherif; Raynes, John; Bui, Tam; Cuccui, Jon; Wren, Brendan W.",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7683400/,136
15313,A meaning-centered spiritual care training program for hospice palliative care teams in South Korea: development and preliminary evaluation,2021-02-09,"INTRODUCTION: Meropenem–vaborbactam (M-V), a new approved antimicrobial, was developed specifically to be effective treatment for the increasingly prevalent and difficult to treat carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infections. However, registration phase 3 clinical studies offer limited applicability to daily medical practice as they often focus on indications such as urinary tract infections or skin and soft tissue infections, which generally have patients with fewer comorbid conditions that the typical patients who develops infection with CRE. The more useful studies are pathogen-focused trials which do not exclude the more complicated subjects with conditions such as renal failure, immunocompromised status, or exposure to prior antibiotic therapy. METHODS: The TANGO II study was an open-label investigation of M-V compared with the best available treatment (BAT) in hospitalized adults with a confirmed infection that was known or suspected to be a CRE infection. TANGO II specifically included patients with comorbidities, prior antibiotic therapy, renal failure, and immunocompromised status that are typical in patients with a CRE infection. Interim data analysis indicated that a significant benefit was seen for those patients receiving M-V over BAT. This analysis reports on subsets of TANGO II study patients with multiple comorbidities and high severity of illness, specifically those with prior antibiotic therapy, renal failure, and immunocompromised status. A patient case that highlights particular complexities and challenges of treating patients with CRE infections in the real world is also presented. RESULTS: Subjects with comorbid conditions had better outcomes when given M-V rather than BAT. CONCLUSION: M-V is a welcome addition to the antibiotic armamentarium for the treatment of severe CRE infections in complicated patients.

HIV plasma viral load testing is challenged by the instability of viral RNA. An approach using an RNA stabilizing buffer is described for the Xpert(®) HIV-1 Viral Load (Cepheid) assay and was tested in remote laboratories in South Africa. Plasma panels with known HIV viral titres were prepared in PrimeStore molecular transport medium for per-module verification and per-instrument external quality assessment. The panels were transported at ambient temperatures to 13 testing laboratories during 2017 and 2018, tested according to standard procedures and uploaded to a web portal for analysis. A total of 275 quality assessment specimens (57 verification panels and two EQA cycles) were tested. All participating laboratories met study verification criteria (n = 171 specimens) with an overall concordance correlation coefficient (ρ(c)) of 0.997 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.996 to 0.998) and a mean bias of −0.019 log copies per milliliter (cp/mL) (95% CI: −0.044 to 0.063). The overall EQA ρ(c) (n = 104 specimens) was 0.999 (95% CI: 0.998 to 0.999), with a mean bias of 0.03 log cp/mL (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.05).

17231,Uganda’s response to sexual harassment in the public health sector: from “Dying Silently” to gender-transformational HRH policy,2021-05-01,"Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne neglected tropical disease endemic in over 100 countries around the world. Available control measures are not always successful, therapeutic options are limited, and there is no vaccine available against human leishmaniasis, although several candidate antigens have been evaluated over the last decades. Plenty of studies have aimed to evaluate the immune response development and a diverse range of host immune factors have been described to be associated with protection or disease progression in leishmaniasis; however, to date, no comprehensive biomarker(s) have been identified as surrogate marker of protection or exacerbation, and lack of enough information remains a barrier for vaccine development. Most of the current understanding of the role of different markers of immune response in leishmaniasis has been collected from experimental animal models. Although the data generated from the animal models are crucial, it might not always be extrapolated to humans. Here, we briefly review the events during Leishmania invasion of host cells and the immune responses induced against Leishmania in animal models and humans and their potential role as a biomarker of protection against human leishmaniasis.","Rostami, Mahmoud Nateghi; Khamesipour, Ali",Med Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8088758/,136

Protocol for a randomized controlled trial,2021-05-07,"To investigate the epidemiology and factors associated with the severity of viral acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in children hospitalized in Manaus, Amazonas, in 2017 to 2018. Retrospective cohort study of children hospitalized at the Hospital and Emergency Room Delphina Rinaldi Abdel Aziz, in Manaus, from April 01, 2017 to August 31, 2018, with a clinical diagnosis of ALRI and nasopharyngeal aspirates positive for at least 1 respiratory virus. One hundred forty-six children aged 0.2 to 66 months (median 7 months) were included. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the disease severity classified by an adapted Walsh et al score: moderate disease, score 0–4, n = 66 (45.2%) and severe disease, score 5–7, n = 80 (54.8%). A greater number of viral ALRI cases were observed in the rainiest months. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most prevalent (n = 103, 70.3%), followed by metapneumovirus (n = 24, 16.4%), influenza virus (n = 17, 11.6%), parainfluenza virus (n = 11, 7.5%), and adenovirus (n = 4, 2.7%). Co-detections of 2 to 3 viruses were found in 12 (8.2%) patients. The presence of viral coinfection was an independent risk factor for disease severity (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.53; 95% CI 1.10–2.14). Twelve patients (8.2%) died, all with severe disease. Risk factors for death were shock (adjusted RR 10.09; 95% CI 2.31–43.90) and need for vasoactive drugs (adjusted RR 10.63; 95% CI 2.44–46.31). There was a higher incidence of viral ALRI in Manaus in the rainy season. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most prevalent virus. The presence of viral coinfection was an independent risk factor for disease severity.","Sobrinho, Fabrícia L.D.V.; Aragon, Davi C.; Carlotti, Ana P.C.P.",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8104226/,136

20253,Exploring the Association Between USMLE Scores and ACGME Milestone Ratings: A Validity Study Using National Data From Emergency Medicine,2021-08-24,"The lexical system of Hong Kong Cantonese has been heavily shaped by the local trilingual environment. The development of cultural- and language-specific norms for Hong Kong Cantonese is fundamental for understanding how the speaker population organize semantic memory, how they utilize their semantic resources, and what information processing strategies they use for the retrieval of semantic knowledge. This study presents a normative database of 72 lexical categories in Hong Kong Cantonese produced by native speakers in a category exemplar production task. Exemplars are enlisted under a category label, along with the instance probabilities and word familiarity scores. Possible English equivalents are given to the exemplars for the convenience of non-HKC speaker researchers. Statistics on categories were further extracted to capture the heterogeneity of the categories: the total number of valid exemplars, the number of exemplars covering 90% of the occurrence and the probabilities of the most frequent exemplars in each category. The database offers a direct lexical sketch of the vocabulary of modern Hong Kong Cantonese in a categorical structure. The category-exemplar lists and the comparative statistics together lay the foundations for further investigations on the Hong Kong Cantonese speaking population from multiple disciplines, such as the structure of semantic knowledge, the time-course of knowledge access, and the processing strategies of young adults. Results of this norm can be also used as a benchmark for other age groups. The database can serve as a crucial resource for establishing initial screening tests to assess the cognitive and psychological functioning of the Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong population in both educational and clinical settings. In sum, this normative study provides a fundamental resource for future studies on language processing mechanisms of Hong Kong Cantonese speaking population, as well as language studies and other cross-language/culture studies on Hong Kong Cantonese.","Li, Bing; Lin, Qiduo; Mak, Hoi Yan; Tzeng, Ovid J.

At the time of writing, more than 60,000,000 patients and more than 1,500,000 deaths were recorded worldwide. Besides the classical chest symptoms, gastrointestinal tract-related symptoms were noted, like diarrhea, abdominal distention, and hematochezia, adding more difficulties in the diagnosis of the disease. Although there are many publications evaluated, the thoracic imaging signs and complications of COVID-19, there are few articles—to the best of our knowledge—that evaluated the gastrointestinal tract imaging features and complications related to COVID-19. RESULTS: In this retrospective study, positive COVID-19 patients who underwent diagnostic computed tomography (CT) for abdominal complaints along a 3-month duration in a large isolation hospital were evaluated. Strict infection control measures were taken during the CT examinations. The data were reviewed on picture archiving and communications systems with clinical data and laboratory result correlation. Thirty patients (30%) showed gastrointestinal (GI) findings, and 70 patients showed unremarkable or non-related GI findings. The 30 patients were classified into four groups: the ischemic group including 10 patients (10/30: 33.33%), the bleeding group included six patients (6/30: 20%), the inflammatory group included nine patients (9/30: 30%), and fluid-filled bowel group included five patients (5/30: 16.6%).

52013,Professional Educational Opportunities,2021-04-24,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: A digital twin can be described as a digital replica of a real-world entity. It simulates the physical state and maybe the biological state and behavior of the real-world entity based on input data. It helps in predicting, optimizing, and improving decision making. It has revolutionized the industrial world, particularly the manufacturing industry, construction and healthcare sector, smart cities, and energy industry. In this perspectives paper, we explore the development and implementation of the digital twin in modern animal farming. In addition to showcasing potential applications, this review provides in-depth insights about the potential implementation and characterization of digital twins in modern animal farming. ABSTRACT: Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and big data are consistently called upon to analyze and comprehend many facets of modern daily life. AI and ML in particular are widely used in animal husbandry to monitor both the animals and environment around the clock, which leads to a better understanding of animal behavior and distress, disease control and prevention, and effective business decisions for the farmer. One particularly promising area that advances upon AI is digital twin technology, which is currently used to improve efficiencies and reduce costs across multiple industries and sectors. In contrast to a model, a digital twin is a digital replica of a real-world entity that is kept current with a constant influx of data. The application of digital twins within the livestock farming sector is the next frontier and has the potential to be used to improve large-scale precision livestock farming practices, machinery and equipment usage, and the health and well-being of a wide variety of farm animals. The mental and emotional states of animals can be monitored using recognition technology that examines facial features, such as ear postures and eye white regions. Used with modeling, simulation and augmented reality technologies, digital twins can help farmers to build more energy-efficient housing structures, predict heat cycles for breeding, discourage negative behaviors of livestock, and potentially much more. As with all disruptive technological advances, the implementation of digital twin technology will demand a thorough cost and benefit analysis of individual farms. Our goal in this review is to assess the progress toward the use of digital twin technology in livestock farming, with the goal of revolutionizing animal husbandry in the future.","Neethirajan, Suresh; Kemp, Bas",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8065673/,136

53925,Therapeutic Approaches to Opioid Use Disorder: What is the Current Standard of Care?,2021-06-03,"Advertising for non-profit organizations through television commercials is a valuable means of communication to raise awareness and receive donations. When it comes to social aspects, personal attitudes such as empathy are significant for reinforcing the intention to donate; and the study of eliciting emotions has critical attention in the literature, especially some types of emotion, such as guilt which mediates empathy. Different methodologies have been used to measure consumer emotions when faced with TV ads stimuli: mainly traditional techniques such as interviews or questionnaires after the ads viewing. In the last ten years, there has also been a great interest in new neuroscience techniques applied to measure emotional and cognitive reactions by physiological signals, frame by frame. Our research has applied neuromarketing technologies during the observation of a UNHCR commercial promoting legacy calls. The objective was to study cognitive and emotional reactions in order to increase the effectiveness whilst having the possibility to verify the results by measuring the benefits in terms of calls from contributors. The purpose of this research is to empirically prove the impact in calls thanks to changes in the message framing strategy in non-profit advertising suggested and measured by neuromarketing techniques. Particularly we measured the cerebral activity through an electroencephalogram to obtain an Approach-Withdrawal Index (AW); the heart rate and galvanic skin response through different sensors in the palm of one hand, to obtain an Emotional Index (EI), and finally, eye fixations through an eye tracker device to obtain the visual attention on key visual areas of the ads. After these indicators’ recordings on a sample of subjects, some suggestions to modify the advertising were made to create a more effective campaign. The results compared, those elicited by the first version of the spot (LVE) and those by the second version (HVE), confirmed that (1) the number of sellable and legacy calls increased with the message framing strategy modified in the second spot (HVE), (2) a lower cognitive and emotional reactions have been obtained in the final section of HVE, (3) the visual attention on the key information of the phone number to call, in the final call to action frames(CTA), was higher in HVE than in the first version of the spot (LVE), (4) the cognitive approach increased during the same CTA frames in HVE.","Martinez-Levy, Ana C.; Rossi, Dario; Cartocci, Giulia; Mancini, Marco; Di Flumeri, Gianluca; Trettel, Arianna; Babiloni, Fabio; Cherubino, Patrizia",Int Rev Public Nonprofit Mark,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8172181/,136

To overcome this dilemma, India’s shift from non-alignment to strategic autonomy poses several questions about its future strategic orientation, notably: Will India enter into a formal alliance with the USA, will India continue to engage China, will India retain close historical relations with Russia or will it more robustly pursue its ‘Act East’ policy? This article attempts a critical analysis of the different strategic options available to India and argues that while entering into a quasi-alliance with the USA, it will retain its strategic autonomy. India could simultaneously retain relations with Russia, China and the ASEAN. However, to the extent possible, its tendency will be to support a multipolar-Asia paradigm rather than a zero-sum alliance system to play a leading role in international fora.","Muraviev, Alexey D.; Ahlawat, Dalbir; Hughes, Lindsay",Int Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8418452/,136

60302,Pediatric Palliative Care Programs in US Hospitals.,2021-06-28,"OBJECTIVE To estimate premature mortality due to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in Brazilian municipalities. METHODS This ecological study estimated premature mortality rates due to cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer and diabetes in Brazilian municipalities, for the three-year periods of 2010 to 2012 and 2015 to 2017, and it analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution of these rates. Data treatment combined proportional redistribution of the missing data and ill-defined causes, and the application of coefficients for under-registration correction. The local empirical Bayesian estimator was used to calculate municipal mortality rates. RESULTS Rates for the set of chronic diseases decreased in Brazil between the three-year periods. The mean rates for total NCDs declined in the South, Southeast and Central-West regions, remained stable in the North and increased in the Northeast. Mortality rates due to cardiovascular diseases were the highest in all regions but showed the greatest declines between the periods. Cancers were the second leading cause of death. The North and Northeast regions stood out as having increased mean rates of cancer between the periods analyzed and showing the highest mean premature mortality rates due to diabetes in the 2015 to 2017 period. CONCLUSION Spatial and temporal distribution of premature mortality rates due to NCDs differed between Brazilian municipalities and regions in the three-year periods evaluated. The South and Southeast had decreased rates of deaths due to cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases, as well as diabetes. The North and Northeast had increased rates of deaths due to cancer. There was an increase in the rate of deaths due to diabetes in the Central-West.","Cardoso, Laís Santos de Magalhães; Teixeira, Renato Azeredo; Ribeiro, Antonio Luiz Pinho; Malta, Deborah Carvalho",Revista brasileira de epidemiologia = Brazilian journal of epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1590/1980-549720210005.supl.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33886878/,136

A systematic scoping review protocol.,2018,"OBJECTIVES The utilization of barbed sutures in laparoscopic hysterectomy has become popular among gynecologic sur-geons. Our aim was to compare the outcomes of two different techniques for closing the vaginal cuff with barbed sutures in laparoscopic hysterectomies. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study was completed on 202 patients who underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign diseases at Istanbul Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training and Research Hospital from April 2014 through June 2016. In group 1 (n = 139), a single-layer continuous suturing method was used; each bite contained the pubocervical fascia and vaginal mucosa anteriorly, and vaginal mucosa and rectovaginal fascia posteriorly. In group 2 (n = 63), a double-layer continuous suturing method was used; only vaginal mucosa was included in the first layer, and a second layer incorporated the pubocervical and rectovaginal fascias. RESULTS Patient characteristics (age, body mass index, parity, previous abdominal surgery, smoking, comorbidity) were similar between the two groups. There were also no differences in total operation time, length of hospitalization, intraop-erative complications, and perioperative change in hemoglobin levels. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of vaginal cuff dehiscence, which was the primary outcome measure of the study. Secondary outcome measures (presence of granulation tissue, spotting, cuff cellulitis) were also similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS We observed no differences in outcomes between single- or double-layer vaginal closure techniques with barbed sutures.","Yildirim, Dogukan; Ozyurek, Sefik Eser; Kiyak, Huseyin; Han, Agahan; Koroglu, Nadiye; Bestel, Aysegul; Topbas, Fitnat",Ginekologia polska,https://doi.org/10.5603/gp.a2018.0040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30084473/,136

METHODS Between October 2019 and January 2021, a total of 15 consecutive patients (age 81.0 [78.1, 84.4] years; 53.3% female; EuroSCORE II 10.6 [6.3, 14.8] %) underwent BASILICA procedure prior to TAVI at our institution. Indications for TAVI were degeneration of stented (n = 12, 80.0%) or stentless (n = 1, 6.7%) bioprosthetic aortic valves, or calcific stenosis of native aortic valves (n = 2, 13.3%), respectively. Individual risk of TAVI-induced coronary obstruction was assessed by pre-procedural computed tomography analysis. Procedural and 30-day outcomes were documented in accordance with Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-2 criteria. RESULTS BASILICA was attempted for single left coronary cusp in 12 patients (80.0%), for single right coronary cusp in 2 patients (13.3%), and for both cusps in 1 patient (6.7%), respectively. The procedure was feasible in 13 patients (86.7%) resulting in effective prevention of coronary obstruction, whilst TAVI was performed without prior successful bioprosthetic leaflet laceration in two patients (13.3%). In one of these patients (6.7%), additional chimney stenting immediately after TAVI was performed. No all-cause deaths or strokes were documented after 30 days. CONCLUSION The BASILICA technique appears to be a feasible, safe and effective concept to avoid iatrogenic coronary artery obstruction during TAVI in both native and bioprosthetic valves of patients at high or prohibitive risk.

64779,Emergency Palliative Care Planning and Support in a COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-04-20,"OBJECTIVES Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion often leads to acute lung injury and multiple organ failure. Ischemic preconditioning is protective in nature and reduces tissue injuries in animal and human models. Although hematimetric parameters are widely used as diagnostic tools, there is no report of the influence of intestinal ischemia/reperfusion and ischemic preconditioning on such parameters. We evaluated the hematological changes during ischemia/reperfusion and preconditioning in rats. METHODS Forty healthy rats were divided into four groups: control, laparotomy, intestinal ischemia/reperfusion and ischemic preconditioning. The intestinal ischemia/reperfusion group received 45 min of superior mesenteric artery occlusion, while the ischemic preconditioning group received 10 min of short ischemia and reperfusion before 45 min of prolonged occlusion. A cell counter was used to analyze blood obtained from rats before and after the surgical procedures and the hematological results were compared among the groups. RESULTS The results showed significant differences in hematimetric parameters among the groups. The parameters that showed significant differences included lymphocyte, white blood cells and granulocyte counts; hematocrit; mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration; red cell deviation width; platelet count; mean platelet volume; plateletcrit and platelet distribution width. CONCLUSION The most remarkable parameters were those related to leukocytes and platelets. Some of the data, including the lymphocyte and granulocytes counts, suggest that ischemic preconditioning attenuates the effect of intestinal ischemia/reperfusion on circulating blood cells. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the hematological responses after intestinal ischemia/reperfusion and IPC, and the present findings may also be used as predictive values.","Tahir, Muhammad; Arshid, Samina; Heimbecker, Ana Maria C; Castro, Mariana S; Souza Montero, Edna Frasson de; Fontes, Belchor; Fontes, Wagner",Clinics,https://doi.org/10.6061/clinics/2015(01)11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25672431/,136
65211,COVID-19 pandemic: changes in cancer admissions.,2020-07-14,"Condition monitoring is a fundamental part of machining, as well as other manufacturing processes where, generally, there are parts that wear out and have to be replaced. Devising proper condition monitoring has been a concern of many researchers, but there is still a lack of robustness and efficiency, most often hindered by the system's complexity or otherwise limited by the inherent noisy signals, a characteristic of industrial processes. The vast majority of condition monitoring approaches do not take into account the temporal sequence when modelling and hence lose an intrinsic part of the context of an actual time-dependent process, fundamental to processes such as cutting. The proposed system uses a multisensory approach to gather information from the cutting process, which is then modelled by a recurrent neural network, capturing the evolutive pattern of wear over time. The system was tested with realistic cutting conditions, and the results show great effectiveness and accuracy with just a few cutting tests. The use of recurrent neural networks demonstrates the potential of such an approach for other time-dependent industrial processes under noisy conditions.","Silva, Rui; Araújo, António",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20164493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796675/,136
65351,Firearm Safety in an Aging United States.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic total proctocolectomy (TPC) with or without ileoanal pouch is a major operation for which the traditional benefits of laparoscopy were not immediately apparent, in part due to the longer operating times. The use of energy devices has been shown to improve operative outcomes for patients who undergo laparoscopic segmental colectomies, but there are limited data for laparoscopic TPC (LTPC). METHODS All patients who underwent LTPC between January 2002 and July 2011 were identified from a prospectively maintained institutional-review-board-approved database. Univariate and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess the impact of electrothermal bipolar vessel sealers (EBVS) for vessel ligation on operative time. Secondary outcomes included vessel ligation failures, estimated blood loss, and other intra- and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS One hundred and forty-five patients underwent LTPC, including 126 restorative ileoanal pouch and diverting ileostomy operations and 19 TPC and end ileostomy procedures. Fifteen percent of LTPCs were totally laparoscopic, 45 % were laparoscopic-assisted, 32 % were hand-assisted, and 8 % were laparoscopic-converted cases. Laparoscopic vessel ligation was performed using EBVS (76 %), endoscopic staplers (12 %), or hybrid techniques (12 %). Vessel ligation groups were similar in demographics, body mass index, surgical indication, immunosuppression, and prior surgery. EBVS were associated with shorter median operative times (247 vs. 290 vs. 300 min, p = 0.018) and fewer vessel ligation failures (1 vs. 11 vs. 12 %, p = 0.027) compared with endoscopic staplers and hybrid techniques, respectively. There were no differences in estimated blood loss and intra-operative complications among the three groups. Length of stay, 30-day morbidity, and 30-day re-operation rates were also similar. On multiple linear regression analysis, EBVS were a significant predictor of operative time (p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS Routine use of electrothermal bipolar vessel ligation for LTPC is associated with shorter operative time and fewer vessel ligation failures without higher risk of complications than other vessel control methods.","Garfinkle, Richard; Boutros, Marylise; Hippalgaonkar, Neha; Maimon, Geva; da Silva, Giovanna; Potenti, Fabio; Wexner, Steven D",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4565-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511115/,136
65898,The association between mental health nursing and hospital admissions for people with serious mental illness: a protocol for a systematic review.,2018,"BACKGROUND The prevalence of exercise as an adjunct therapy to cancer treatments including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery is growing rapidly and has been shown to improve health outcomes, treatment completion rates, and quality of life in people affected by cancer. Given the complexity of delivering cancer services during coronavirus disease (COVID-19), many people who are undergoing cancer treatment are unable to access exercise services. This review aims to investigate: (1) the feasibility of exercise telehealth interventions for individuals diagnosed with cancer; and (2) the impact of exercise telehealth interventions for people affected by cancer on physical and psychosocial outcomes. METHODS/DATA SOURCES The literature search was conducted in four electronic databases (CINAHL, Cochrane, Medline, and Psych Info) from January 1, 2010 until May 1, 2020. All peer-reviewed qualitative and quantitative studies were included irrespective of study design. Studies that investigated adults (aged ≥18 years) with a diagnosis of any cancer, irrespective of treatment type, cancer stage or primary/secondary nature of disease were included. RESULTS Twenty-nine studies (a total of 3698 participants across the included studies) were synthesized. Across the included studies the interventions were broadly classified into four main areas of telehealth: web-based, mobile applications, SMS messaging, and telephone interventions. CONCLUSION Participants across the studies showed good compliance, symptom relief and reported an overall positive experience using telehealth for exercise. There were no adverse events reported in these studies. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, more research is required to assess the feasibility of telehealth platforms such as Zoom, Skype, Microsoft Teams, or FaceTime, and to determine the overall participant and exercise professional telehealth exercise delivery experience. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE Telehealth uses telecommunications technology as a tool to deliver health care to populations with limited access to cancer care. Quality care of a person living with cancer requires multidisciplinary team-based care and telecommunications technology can support interprofessional care. This review has underscored that telecommunications is a critical tool in the delivery of cancer care to enable timely ongoing support for exercise interventions for those affected by cancer. It remains important for people affected by cancer to continue to engage in and maintain regular exercise under the guidance of qualified health professionals in keeping with evidence-based clinical guidelines.","Morrison, Kittani S; Paterson, Catherine; Toohey, Kellie",Seminars in oncology nursing,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soncn.2020.151092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33223409/,136

The effects of elevated ABP after BCPA on cerebrovascular hemodynamics are unknown. We sought to determine the relationship between elevated ABP and cerebrovascular autoregulation after BCPA. METHODS Prospective, observational study on infants with single-ventricle physiology after BCPA surgery. Continuous recordings of mean ABP, mean cavopulmonary artery pressure (PAP), near-infrared spectroscopy measures of cerebral oximetry (regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2)), and relative cerebral blood volume index were obtained from admission to extubation. Autoregulation was measured as hemoglobin volume index (HVx). Physiologic variables, including the HVx, were tested for variance across ABP. RESULTS Sixteen subjects were included in the study. Elevated ABP post-BCPA was associated with both, elevated PAP (P<0.0001) and positive HVx (dysautoregulation; P<0.0001). No association was observed between ABP and alterations in rSO2. Using piecewise regression, the relationship of PAP to ABP demonstrated a breakpoint at 68 mm Hg (interquartile range (IQR) 62-70 mm Hg). Curve fit of HVx as a function of ABP identified optimal ABP supporting robust autoregulation at a median ABP of 55 mm Hg (IQR 51-64 mm Hg). CONCLUSIONS Elevated ABP post-BCPA is associated with cerebrovascular dysautoregulation, and elevated PAP. The effects, of prolonged dysautoregulation within this population, require further study.","Cabrera, Antonio G; Kibler, Kathleen K; Blaine Easley, R; Goldsworthy, Michelle; Shekerdemian, Lara S; Andropoulos, Dean B; Heinle, Jeffrey; Gottlieb, Erin A; Vu, Eric; Brady, Ken M",Pediatric research,https://doi.org/10.1038/pr.2018.31; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29538363/,136

In the following weeks, emergency departments in the UK reported a reduction in attendances. We aimed to explore the incidence of emergency calls across North East England, as well as the number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) deaths. METHODS Data were collected for all patients who contacted North East Ambulance Service between 4 March 2019-2 June 2019 and 2 March 2020-31 May 2020 suffering stroke, ST elevation myocardial infarction, allergy, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, falls, intoxication, seizure, sepsis, acute coronary syndrome and OHCA. RESULTS There were a reduction in incidence of calls, excluding OHCA, resulting in ambulance activation during the pandemic compared with same period in 2019, 16 743 versus 19 639, respectively (-14.74%). The decline in calls was partially reversed by the end of May 2020. Incidence of OHCA at the time of the national lockdown had increased by 13.79% with a peak increase of 73.56% in the second week in April 2020. OHCA deaths peaked in the first 2 weeks in April 2020, 95.65% and 90.07%, respectively, but by the end May 2020, incidence of OHCA and OHCA deaths had returned to prelockdown levels. CONCLUSION Incidence of emergency calls were reduced during the pandemic compared with 2019. There was a rise in incidence of OHCA and OHCA deaths during the same period; however, these changes appear transient. Further research is required to understand patient behaviour towards seeking help during the pandemic and the long-term consequences of not doing so.","Charlton, Karl; Limmer, Matthew; Moore, Hayley",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2020-210291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33832923/,136

The mean duration of surgery, intra-operative bleeding volume and post-operative hospital stay were 176 min, 70 ml and 4.7 days, respectively. There were no particular peri-operative complications in spite of dense adhesions or simultaneous laparoscopic procedures.

74592,Effects of Sleep Fragmentation and Induced Mood on Pain Tolerance and Pain Sensitivity in Young Healthy Adults.,2018,"The comprehensive kinetic mechanism of the OH-initiated gas-phase oxidation of pyrrole is first theoretically reported in a broad range of conditions (T = 200-2000 K &P = 1-7600 Torr). On the potential energy surface constructed at the M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ level, the temperature- and pressure-dependent behaviors of the title reaction were characterized using the stochastic Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus based Master Equation (RRKM-ME) rate model. The corrections of the hindered internal rotation and quantum tunneling treatments were included. The calculated results reveal the competition between the two distinct pathways: OH-addition and direct H-abstraction. The former channels are found favorable at low-temperature and high-pressure range (e.g., T < 900 K and P = 760 Torr) where non-Arrhenius and positive pressure-dependent behaviors of the rate constants are noticeably observed, while the latter predominate at temperatures higher than 900 K at atmospheric pressure and no pressure dependence on the rate constant is found. The predicted global rate constants are in excellent agreement with laboratory values; thus, the derived kinetic parameters are recommended for modeling/simulation of N-heterocycle-related applications in atmospheric and even in combustion conditions. Besides, pyrrole should not be considered as a persistent organic pollutant owing to its short atmospheric lifetime (∼1 h) towards OH radicals. The secondary mechanisms of the subsequent reactions of two OH-pyrrole adducts (namely, I1 and I2) with two abundant species, O2/NO, which are relevant to the atmospheric degradation process, were also investigated. It is also revealed by TD-DFT calculations that two OH-pyrrole adducts (I1 &I2), nine intermediates, Ii (i = 3-11) and four products (P1, P2, P3 and P6) can undergo photodissociation under the sunlight.","Mai, Tam V-T; Nguyen, Hieu T; Huynh, Lam K",Chemosphere,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818845/,136
75706,Diabetes Care at the Times of Transition and COVID-19 Pandemics (Ukrainian Experience).,2020-05-29,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Perioperative hyperglycemia has been associated with adverse outcomes in several fields of surgery. In this observational study, we identified factors associated with an increased risk of hyperglycemia following hip and knee replacement. PATIENTS AND METHODS We prospectively monitored changes in glucose following primary hip and knee replacements in 191 patients with osteoarthritis. Possible associations of patient characteristics and operation-related factors with hyperglycemia (defined as glucose > 7.8 mmol/L in 2 consecutive measurements) and severe hyperglycemia (glucose > 10 mmol/L) were analyzed using binary logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, operated joint, and anesthesiological risk score. RESULTS 76 patients (40%) developed hyperglycemia, and 48 of them (25% of the whole cohort) had severe hyperglycemia. Glycemic responses were similar following hip replacement and knee replacement. Previously diagnosed diabetes was associated with an increased risk of hyperglycemia and severe hyperglycemia, compared to patients with normal glucose metabolism, whereas newly diagnosed diabetes and milder glucose metabolism disorders had no effect. In patients without previously diagnosed diabetes, increased values of preoperative glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting glucose on the day of operation were associated with hyperglycemia. Higher anesthesiological risk score-but none of the operation-related factors analyzed-was associated with an increased risk of hyperglycemia. INTERPRETATION Perioperative hyperglycemia is common in primary hip and knee replacements. Previously diagnosed diabetes is the strongest risk factor for hyperglycemia. In patients with no history of diabetes, preoperative HbA1c and fasting glucose on the day of operation can be used to stratify the risk of hyperglycemia.","Jämsen, Esa; Nevalainen, Pasi I; Eskelinen, Antti; Kalliovalkama, Jarkko; Moilanen, Teemu",Acta orthopaedica,https://doi.org/10.3109/17453674.2014.987064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25409255/,136

81268,Correlation of periodontal parameters to various types of smokeless tobacco in tobacco pouch keratosis patients: A cross-sectional study.,2020,"OBJECTIVES The emergency department (ED) is a challenging setting to conduct pharmacogenomic studies and integrate that data into fast-paced and potentially life-saving treatment decisions. Therefore, our objective is to present the methods and feasibility of a pilot pharmacogenomic study set in the ED that measured pediatric bronchodilator response (BDR) during acute asthma exacerbations. METHODS This is an exploratory pilot study that collected buccal swabs for DNA and measured BDR during ED encounters for pediatric asthma exacerbations. We evaluated the study's feasibility with a qualitative analysis of ED provider surveys and quantitatively by the proportion of eligible patients enrolled. RESULTS We enrolled 59 out of 90 patients (65%) that were identified and considered eligible during a 5-month period (target enrollment 60 patients over 12 months). The median patient age was 7 years (interquartile range 4-9 years), 61% (N = 36) were male, and 92% (N = 54) were African American. Quality DNA collection was successful for all 59 patients. The ED provider survey response rate was 100%. Most ED providers reported that the study did not impact their workflow (98% of physicians, 88% of nurses, and 90% of respiratory therapists). ED providers did report difficulties with spirometry in the younger age group. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacogenomic studies can be conducted in the ED setting, and enroll a younger patient population with a high proportion of minority participants. By disseminating this study's methods and feasibility analysis, we aim to increase interest in pharmacogenomic studies set in the ED and aimed toward future ED-based pharmacogenomic decision-making.","Fishe, Jennifer N; Higley, Rebecca K; Casey, Deirdre; Hogans, Lamont; Wylie, Todd W; Hendry, Phyllis L; Henson, Morgan; Bertrand, Andrew; Blake, Kathryn V",Pharmacogenetics and genomics,https://doi.org/10.1097/fpc.0000000000000414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33017130/,136
81484,"Using a morphine equivalence metric to quantify opioid consumption: examining the capacity to provide effective treatment of debilitating pain at the global, regional, and country levels.",2013,"BACKGROUND During the COVID-19 emergency, medical students were mandated to remain home, creating challenges to providing education remotely for third-year clinical rotations. This study aims to assess student reception and investigate objective outcomes to determine if online learning is a suitable alternative. METHODS Medical students enrolled in the third-year surgical clerkship during COVID-19 were asked to participate in a survey. 19 of 27 (70%) students participated. Content, faculty-led lectures, and resident-led problem-based learning (PBL) sessions were assessed using a ten-point Likert scale. National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) examination, weekly quiz, and oral examination scores were compared to previous years. Student t-tests compared the groups. RESULTS The median age was 25 years. Comparing in-person to electronic sessions, there was no difference in effectiveness of faculty sessions preparing students for NBME (6.2 vs. 6.7, P = .46) or oral examinations (6.4 vs. 6.8, P = .58); there was also no difference in resident-led PBL sessions preparing students for NBME (7.2 vs. 7.2, P = .92) or oral examinations (7.4 vs. 7.6, P = .74). Comparing this group to students from the previous academic year, there was no difference in weekly quiz (85.3 vs. 87.8, P = .13), oral examination (89.8 vs. 93.9, P = .07), or NBME examination (75.3 vs. 77.4, P = .33) scores. DISCUSSION Surgical medical didactic education can effectively be conducted remotely through faculty-led lectures and resident-led PBL sessions. Students did not have a preference between in-person and electronic content in preparation for examinations. As scores did not change, electronic education may be adequate for preparing students for examinations in times of crisis such as COVID-19.","Kronenfeld, Joshua P; Ryon, Emily L; Kronenfeld, Daniel S; Hui, Vanessa W; Rodgers, Steven E; Thorson, Chad M; Sands, Laurence R",The American surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003134820983194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33372812/,136

82630,Eye health and quality of life: an umbrella review protocol.,2020-08-30,"BACKGROUND Parents have faced substantial social and economic challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Preliminary cross-sectional research has demonstrated increases in mental health problems in mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with pre-pandemic estimates. We aimed to study an existing longitudinal cohort of mothers to assess changes in the prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety symptoms as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic over time and at the individual level. METHODS In this longitudinal observational study, women who took part in the All Our Families pregnancy cohort in Canada were invited to complete a COVID-19 impact survey between May 20 and July 15, 2020. Women who had not agreed to additional research, had discontinued, were lost to follow-up, or who were not contactable via email were excluded. Maternal depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared with three previous estimates collected at 3, 5, and 8-year timepoints (between April, 2012, and October, 2019). Depression symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Repeated cross-sectional analyses were done to assess temporal trends and fixed-effects regression models were fitted to assess within-person change over time. FINDINGS Of the 3387 women included in the All Our Families study, 2445 women were eligible and were invited to participate in the COVID-19 impact study, of whom 1333 consented to participate, and 1301 were included in the longitudinal analysis. At the COVID-19 impact survey timepoint, a higher proportion of mothers had clinically significant depression (35·21%, 95% CI 32·48-38·04) and anxiety symptoms (31·39%, 28·76-34·15) than at all previous data collection timepoints. The mean depression score (8·31, 95% CI 7·97-8·65) and anxiety score (11·90, 11·66-12·13) at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint were higher than previous data collection waves at the 3-year timepoint (mean depression score 5·05, 4·85-5·25; mean anxiety score 9·51, 9·35-9·66), 5-year timepoint (mean depression score 5·43, 5·20-5·66; mean anxiety score 9·49, 9·33-9·65), and 8-year timepoint (mean depression score 5·79, 5·55-6·02; mean anxiety score 10·26, 10·10-10·42). For the within-person comparisons, depression scores were a mean of 2·30 points (95% CI 1·95-2·65) higher and anxiety scores were a mean of 1·04 points (0·65-1·43) higher at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint, after controlling for time trends. Larger increases in depression and anxiety symptoms were observed for women who had income disruptions, difficulty balancing home schooling with work responsibilities, and those with difficulty obtaining childcare. White mothers had greater increases in anxiety scores than non-white mothers and health-care workers had smaller increases in depressive symptoms than non-health-care workers. INTERPRETATION Compared with previous estimates, the prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety among mothers in a Canadian cohort increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial support, childcare provision, and avoiding the closure of schools, might be key priorities for preventing future increases in maternal psychological distress.

Methods Adverse events were prospectively evaluated using an electronic diary in 135 healthy adults who received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (AZD1222, AstraZeneca/Oxford, n = 42; or BNT162b2, Pfizer/BioNTech, n = 93). We semi-quantitatively measured anti-S1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline, 3 weeks after the first dose of AZD1222 or BNT162b2, and 2 weeks after the second dose of BNT162b2. We evaluated the association between the maximum grade of local or systemic adverse events and the anti-S1 IgG optical density using multivariate linear regression with adjustment for age, sex, and use of antipyretics. Results The median age of the 135 vaccinees was 30 years (36 years in the AZD1222 group and 29 years in the BNT162b2 group) and 25.9% were male (9.5% in the AZD1222 group and 33.3% in the BNT162b2 group). Local and systemic adverse events were generally comparable after the first dose of AZD1222 and the second dose of BNT162b2. The grades of local and systemic adverse events were not significantly associated with anti-S1 IgG levels in the AZD1222 or BNT162b2 group. Conclusions Local and systemic reactogenicity may not be associated with humoral immunogenicity after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.","Hwang, Young Hoon; Song, Kyoung-Ho; Choi, Yunsang; Go, Suryeong; Choi, Su-Jin; Jung, Jongtak; Kang, Chang Kyung; Choe, Pyoeng Gyun; Kim, Nam-Joong; Park, Wan Beom; Oh, Myoung-Don",The Korean journal of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.3904/kjim.2021.210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34038996/,136

86318,Healthcare experiences of patients with chronic heart failure in Germany: a scoping review.,2020-10-10,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Data on the relation of egg consumption with risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary heart disease (CHD) are limited and inconsistent. Few studies have controlled for overall dietary patterns in egg-T2D or egg-CHD analyses, and it is unclear whether any observed elevated risks of T2D and CHD with frequent egg consumption is real or due to confounding by dietary habits. We tested the hypothesis that frequent egg consumption is associated with a higher risk of T2D and CHD risk after adjustment for overall dietary patterns among adults. DESIGN We used prospective cohort design to complete time-to-event analyses. METHODS We pooled de novo, harmonized, individual-level analyses from nine US cohorts (n = 103,811). Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios separately in each cohort adjusting for age, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), exercise, smoking, alcohol intake, and dietary patterns. We pooled cohort-specific results using an inverse-variance weighted method to estimate summary relative risks. RESULTS Median age ranged from 25 to 72 years. Median egg consumption was 1 egg per week in most of the cohorts. While egg consumption up to one per week was not associated with T2D risk, consumption of ≥2 eggs per week was associated with elevated risk [27% elevated risk of T2D comparing 7+ eggs/week with none (95% CI: 16%-37%)]. There was little evidence for heterogeneity across cohorts and we observed similar conclusions when stratified by BMI. Overall, egg consumption was not associated with the risk of CHD. However, in a sensitivity analysis, there was a 30% higher risk of CHD (95% CI: 3%-56%) restricted to older adults consuming 5-6 eggs/week. CONCLUSIONS Our data showed an elevated risk of T2D with egg consumption of ≥2 eggs per week but not with <2 eggs/week. While there was no overall association of egg consumption with CHD risk, the elevated CHD observed with consumption of 5-6 eggs/week in older cohorts merits further investigation.","Djoussé, Luc; Zhou, Guohai; McClelland, Robyn L; Ma, Nanxun; Zhou, Xia; Kabagambe, Edmond K; Talegawkar, Sameera A; Judd, Suzanne E; Biggs, Mary L; Fitzpatrick, Annette L; Clark, Cheryl R; Gagnon, David R; Steffen, Lyn M; Gaziano, J Michael; Lee, I-Min; Buring, Julie E; Manson, JoAnn E",Clinical nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.03.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932789/,136

DESIGN Systematic review. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Which PROMs and PREMs are used in clinical quality registries for people with cutaneous melanoma, how they are collected, frequency of collection, participant recruitment methods and funding models for each registry. RESULTS 1134 studies were identified from MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, Embase, PsychInfo, Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects databases and TUFTS Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, alongside grey literature, from database inception to 5th February 2020. Following screening, 14 studies were included, identifying four relevant registries: Dutch Melanoma Registry, Adelphi Real-World Disease-Specific Programme (Melanoma), Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Initial treatment and Long-term Evaluation of Survivorship Registry, and Cancer Experience Registry. These used seven PROMs: EuroQol-5 Dimensions, Functional Assessment of Cancer-General (FACT-G) and FACT-Melanoma (FACT-M), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Cancer 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), Fatigue Assessment Scale Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Patient-Reported Outcome Measures Information System-29 and one PREM; EORTC QLQ-Information Module 26. PROMs/PREMs in registries were reported to improve transparency of care; facilitate clinical auditing for quality assessment; enable cost-effectiveness analyses and create large-scale research platforms. Challenges included resource burden for data entry and potential collection bias toward younger, more affluent respondents. Feedback from patients with melanoma highlighted the relevance of PROMs/PREMs in assessing patient outcomes and patient experiences. CONCLUSIONS Clinical registries indicate PROMs/PREMs for melanoma care can be incorporated and address important gaps, however cost and collection bias may limit generalisability.

The outcomes and optimal management for patients with cancer and incidental VTE remain debated. OBJECTIVES We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the outcomes in patients with cancer and incidentally detected VTE compared to those with symptomatic events. PATIENT/METHODS We searched the electronic database and included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies reporting recurrent VTE, major bleeding events, and mortality in patients with cancer and incidental VTE comparing to symptomatic VTE. RESULTS We included 23 studies for the systematic review: 3 RCTs and 20 observational studies. The meta-analysis of the 3 RCTs showed a significantly lower rate of VTE recurrence at 6 months in patients with incidental VTE compared to those with symptomatic VTE (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44-0.87). The risk of major bleeding events at 6 months was numerically higher with incidental VTE compared to symptomatic VTE (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.99-2.20). There was no difference in overall mortality. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with cancer, incidental VTE was associated with a lower rate of VTE recurrence compared to symptomatic VTE, with a trend in increased major bleeding events. The risk-benefit ratio of anticoagulation may differ between incidental and symptomatic events and should be considered in the management.","Caiano, Lucia; Carrier, Marc; Marshall, Andrea; Young, Annie M; Ageno, Walter; Delluc, Aurélien; Wang, Tzu-Fei",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.15435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161655/,136
91787,Pregnancy and Access to Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder.,2020-08-03,"AIM The aim of the study was to evaluate hepatocellular damage and immune inflammation in various forms of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). MATERIALS AND METHODS 104 patients with ALD were examined: 15 (14.4%) with liver steatosis (LS), 19 (18.3%) with steatohepatitis and 70 (67.3%) with liver cirrhosis (LC); men 50 (48.1%), women 54 (51.9%); age 45.78.4 years. Traditional clinical, laboratory, instrumental studies were performed, the levels of fragments of cytokeratin-18 (FCK-18), cytokines IL-1, TNF-, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 were determined by ELISA. The control group consisted of 39 healthy individuals: men 20 (51.2%), women 19 (48.7%), age 48.58.3 years. RESULTS In LS, an increase in the level of FCK-18 was noted with normal aminotransferase activity, the content of TNF-, IL-6, IL-1, IL-8 increased and the level of IL-4 decreased compared to those in healthy individuals. In steatohepatitis, a triple increase in aminotransferases and FCK-18 was observed compared with LS, as well as an increase in the level of inflammatory mediators, to a greater extent IL-6, to a lesser extent IL-8, TNF-, a decrease in IL-4, IL-1 remained at the same level. In LC, there was a further increase in FCK-18, significantly more pronounced than an increase in AST, and the increase in cytokines continued to the same extent, the levels of IL-6 and IL-8, to a lesser extent IL-1 and TNF-, and the level of IL-4. CONCLUSION With the progression of ALD from LS to steatohepatitis, hepatic cell damage was carried out by equally pronounced processes of hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis, with the development of cirrhosis of the liver, parenchyma damage occurred mainly due to hepatocyte apoptosis. The immuno-inflammatory process progressively increased from the stage of LS to LC with IL-6 and IL-8 undergoing the greatest dynamics. FCK-18 can serve as a non-invasive marker of hepatic cell damage, and IL-6 and IL-8 markers of immune inflammation in ALD.","Rodina, A S; Shubina, M E; Kurbatova, I V; Topchieva, L V; Dudanova, O P",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,https://doi.org/10.26442/00403660.2021.01.200587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720620/,136

At 11 months, functional outcomes, patient satisfaction and quality of life were excellent. Primary osteoporosis was diagnosed and treatment with bisphosphonates was initiated.Two-level PFFs are rare and complex. Due to ageing and a subsequent increase in osteoporosis, numbers of PFFs with complex fracture patterns might increase in the future. Adequate treatment and early prevention of osteoporosis are key to reduce this risk and lower the overall burden.

93789,Incorporating and evaluating citizen engagement in health research: a scoping review protocol.,2021-09-28,"INTRODUCTION Sepsis is defined as detrimental immune response to an infection. This overwhelming reaction often abolishes a normal reconstitution of the immune cell homeostasis that in turn increases the risk for further complications. Recent studies revealed a favourable impact of ketone bodies on resolution of inflammation. Thus, a ketogenic diet may provide an easy-to-apply and cost-effective treatment option potentially alleviating sepsis-evoked harm. This study is designed to assess the feasibility, efficiency and safety of a ketogenic diet in septic patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This monocentric study is a randomised, controlled and open-label trial, which is conducted on an intensive care unit of a German university hospital. As intervention enteral nutrition with reduced amount of carbohydrates (ketogenic) or standard enteral nutrition (control) is applied. The primary endpoint is the detection of ketone bodies in patients' blood and urine samples. As secondary endpoints, the impact on important safety-relevant issues (eg, glucose metabolism, lactate serum concentration, incidence of metabolic acidosis, thyroid function and 30-day mortality) and the effect on the immune system are analysed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The study has received the following approvals: Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of Ruhr-University Bochum (No. 18-6557-BR). Results will be made available to critical care survivors, their caregivers, the funders, the critical care societies and other researchers by publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

94425,Assessment tools for problematic opioid use in palliative care: A scoping review.,2021-05-17,"OBJECTIVES To assess the compliance of Asian intensive care units and hospitals to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's resuscitation and management bundles. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the impact of compliance on mortality and the organisational characteristics of hospitals that were associated with higher compliance. DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING 150 intensive care units in 16 Asian countries. PARTICIPANTS 1285 adult patients with severe sepsis admitted to these intensive care units in July 2009. The organisational characteristics of participating centres, the patients' baseline characteristics, the achievement of targets within the resuscitation and management bundles, and outcome data were recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Compliance with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's resuscitation (six hours) and management (24 hours) bundles. RESULTS Hospital mortality was 44.5% (572/1285). Compliance rates for the resuscitation and management bundles were 7.6% (98/1285) and 3.5% (45/1285), respectively. On logistic regression analysis, compliance with the following bundle targets independently predicted decreased mortality: blood cultures (achieved in 803/1285; 62.5%, 95% confidence interval 59.8% to 65.1%), broad spectrum antibiotics (achieved in 821/1285; 63.9%, 61.3% to 66.5%), and central venous pressure (achieved in 345/870; 39.7%, 36.4% to 42.9%). High income countries, university hospitals, intensive care units with an accredited fellowship programme, and surgical intensive care units were more likely to be compliant with the resuscitation bundle. CONCLUSIONS While mortality from severe sepsis is high, compliance with resuscitation and management bundles is generally poor in much of Asia. As the centres included in this study might not be fully representative, achievement rates reported might overestimate the true degree of compliance with recommended care and should be interpreted with caution. Achievement of targets for blood cultures, antibiotics, and central venous pressure was independently associated with improved survival.","Phua, Jason; Koh, Younsuck; Du, Bin; Tang, Yao-Qing; Divatia, Jigeeshu V; Tan, Cheng Cheng; Gomersall, Charles D; Faruq, Mohammad Omar; Shrestha, Babu Raja; Gia Binh, Nguyen; Arabi, Yaseen M; Salahuddin, Nawal; Wahyuprajitno, Bambang; Tu, Mei-Lien; Wahab, Ahmad Yazid Haji Abd; Hameed, Akmal A; Nishimura, Masaji; Procyshyn, Mark; Chan, Yiong Huak",BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.d3245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21669950/,136

In developed countries this is a rare entity. In the literature different surgical techniques have been reported so far to achieve a successful treatment. CASE PRESENTATION We present the case of a 63 year-old man suffering from a giant inguinoscrotal hernia, whom we treated using a combined open transabdominal and inguinal approach following an unsuccessful laparoscopic attempt. Meshes were placed in a premuscular position (Lichtenstein's procedure) and in a preperitoneal position. In addition, a reconstruction of the abdominal wall by modified components separation technique was performed. During the early postoperative period no complications were registered. Intensive care treatment was not necessary. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 8 in an excellent condition. Six months after surgery a scrotal hematocele was diagnosed and operatively removed. After a follow-up of 1.5 years neither hernia recurrence, nor chronic groin pain were recorded. The patient reported to be sexually active. His quality of life improved notably. Additionally, a Medline and PubMed database research was performed to create an overall picture of the existing surgical treatment strategies. Included were patients with diagnosis of primary giant inguinoscrotal hernia according to the given definition. Emergency interventions and cases without details of the surgical approach were excluded. CONCLUSIONS Firstly, this report describes a novel, successful surgical treatment of a giant inguinoscrotal hernia without administering preoperative progressive pneumoperitoneum therapy or visceral resection. Secondly, we summarize cases previously reported as a practical guide for possible surgical therapy approaches.","Staubitz, Julia Isabelle; Gassmann, Peter; Kauff, Daniel Wilhelm; Lang, Hauke",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-017-0331-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29258479/,136

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant air medical activity from rural and remote Australia. COVID-19 and the necessary public health and socioeconomic interventions are likely to significantly compound mental health problems for both the general public and the mental health workforce servicing rural and remote communities. However, the COVID-19 crisis provides a window of opportunity to develop, support, and build novel and sustainable solutions to the chronic mental health service vulnerabilities in rural and remote areas in Australia and other countries.","Gardiner, Fergus W; Bishop, Lara; Churilov, Leonid; Collins, Noel; O'Donnell, John; Coleman, Mathew",Air medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amj.2020.08.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33228907/,136
101293,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the paediatric emergency department attendances in Argentina.,2020-06-18,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has given rise to a pandemic of unprecedented proportions in the modern era because of its highly contagious nature and impact on human health and society: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and established CV disease (CVD) are among those initially identified at the highest risk for serious complications, including death. Subsequent studies have pointed out that patients with cancer are also at high risk for a critical disease course. Therefore, the most vulnerable patients are seemingly those with both cancer and CVD, and a careful, unified approach in the evaluation and management of this patient population is especially needed in times of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review provides an overview of the unique implications of the viral outbreak for the field of cardio-oncology and outlines key modifications in the approach to this ever-increasing patient population. These modifications include a shift toward greater utilization of cardiac biomarkers and a more focused CV imaging approach in the broader context of modifications to typical practice pathways. The goal of this strategic adjustment is to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (or other future viral outbreaks) while not becoming negligent of CVD and its important impact on the overall outcomes of patients who are being treated for cancer.","Lenihan, Daniel; Carver, Joseph; Porter, Charles; Liu, Jennifer E; Dent, Susan; Thavendiranathan, Paaladinesh; Mitchell, Joshua D; Nohria, Anju; Fradley, Michael G; Pusic, Iskra; Stockerl-Goldstein, Keith; Blaes, Anne; Lyon, Alexander R; Ganatra, Sarju; López-Fernández, Teresa; O'Quinn, Rupal; Minotti, Giorgio; Szmit, Sebastian; Cardinale, Daniela; Alvarez-Cardona, Jose; Curigliano, Giuseppe; Neilan, Tomas G; Herrmann, Joerg",CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32910493/,136
102194,Preclinical efficacy in therapeutic area guidelines from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency: a cross-sectional study.,2018,"Ulcerative colitis (UC), a kind of inflammatory bowel disease, is generally characterized by chronic, persistent, relapsing, and nonspecific ulceration of the bowel, which is widespread in the world. Although the pathogenesis of UC is multifactorial, growing evidence has demonstrated that gut microbiota and its metabolites are closely related to the development of UC. Lizhong decoction (LZD), a well-known classical Chinese herbal prescription, has been used to clinically treat UC for long time, but its mechanism is not clear. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing combining with untargeted metabolomics profiling was used to investigate how LZD worked. Results indicated that LZD could shape the gut microbiota structure and modify metabolic profiles. The abundance of opportunistic pathogens such as Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Enterobacter, and Escherichia-Shigella correlated with intestinal inflammation markedly decreased, while the levels of beneficial bacteria including Blautia, Muribaculaceae_norank, Prevotellaceae UCG-001, and Ruminiclostridium 9 elevated in various degrees. Additionally, fecal metabolite profiles reflecting microbial activities showed that adenosine, lysoPC(18:0), glycocholic acid, and deoxycholic acid notably decreased, while cholic acid, α-linolenic acid, stearidonic acid, and L-tryptophan significantly increased after LZD treatment. Hence, based on the systematic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics of gut flora, the results provided a novel insight that microbiota and its metabolites might be potential targets for revealing the mechanism of LZD on amelioration of UC.Key Points • The potential mechanism of LZD on the amelioration of UC was firstly investigated.• LZD could significantly shape the structure of gut microbiota.• LZD could notably modulate the fecal metabolic profiling of UC mice.

104410,Universal Drug Coverage and Socioeconomic Disparities in Health Care Costs Among Persons With Diabetes.,2020-07-08,"PURPOSE To assess the reliability and construct validity of a self-paced, submaximal run test (SRTRPE) for monitoring aerobic fitness. The SRTRPE monitors running velocity (v), heart rate (HRex), and blood lactate concentration (B[La]), during three 3-minute stages prescribed by ratings of perceived exertion (RPEs) of 10, 13, and 17. METHODS Forty (14 female) trained endurance runners completed a treadmill graded exercise test for the determination of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), v at VO2max (vVO2max), and v at 2 mmol·L-1 (vLT1) and 4 mmol·L-1 (vLT2) B[La]. Within 7 days, participants completed the SRTRPE. Convergent validity between the SRTRPE and graded exercise test parameters was assessed through linear regression. Eleven participants completed a further 2 trials of the SRTRPE within a 72-hour period to quantify test-retest reliability. RESULTS There were large correlations between v at all stages of the SRTRPE and VO2max (r range = .57-.63), vVO2max (.50-.66), and vLT2 (.51-.62), with vRPE 17 displaying the strongest associations (r > .60). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC3,1) were moderate to high for parameters v (range = .76-.84), HRex (.72-.92), and %HRmax (.64-.89) at all stages of the SRTRPE. The corresponding coefficients of variation were 2.5% to 5.6%. All parameters monitored at intensity RPE 17 displayed the greatest reliability. CONCLUSIONS The SRTRPE was shown to be a valid and reliable test for monitoring parameters associated with aerobic fitness, displaying the potential of this submaximal, time-efficient test to monitor responses to endurance training.","Sangan, Hannah F; Hopker, James G; Davison, Glen; McLaren, Shaun J",International journal of sports physiology and performance,https://doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2020-0904; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140417/,136

The disease is prevalent in South America and Africa and causes crop loss to indigent people who rely on beans as a primary source of daily nutrition. In susceptible beans, Pph causes water-soaking at the site of infection and produces phaseolotoxin, an inhibitor of bean arginine biosynthesis. In resistant beans, Pph triggers a hypersensitive response that limits the spread of infection. Here, we used high-throughput mass spectrometry to interrogate the responses to two different Pph isolates on a single line of common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris PI G19833 with a reference genome sequence. We obtained quantitative information for 4,135 bean proteins. A subset of 160 proteins with similar accumulation changes during both susceptible and resistant reactions included salicylic acid responders EDS1 and NDR1, ethylene and jasmonic acid biosynthesis enzymes, and proteins enabling vesicle secretion. These proteins revealed the activation of a basal defense involving hormonal responses and the mobilization of extracellular proteins. A subset of 29 proteins specific to hypersensitive immunity included SOBIR1, a G-type lectin-receptor-like kinase, and enzymes needed for glucoside and phytoalexin production. Virus-induced gene silencing revealed that the G-type lectin-receptor-like kinase suppresses bacterial infection. Together, the results define the proteomics of disease resistance to Pph in beans and support a model whereby the induction of hypersensitive immunity reinstates defenses targeted by Pph.","Cooper, Bret; Campbell, Kimberly B; Beard, Hunter; Garrett, Wesley M; Ferreira, Marcio E",Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI,https://doi.org/10.1094/mpmi-05-20-0112-r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633604/,136

111848,An ethical conundrum: Palliative care in the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-03-01,"RATIONALE Occasional cases of bronchiolitis show pathologic features somewhat suggestive of constrictive bronchiolitis, but with granulation tissue plugs that variably occlude the lumen in a pattern more typical of organizing pneumonia. These cases are poorly defined in the literature and the course of patients with this pattern of disease is unclear. OBJECTIVE To describe an uncommon and potentially treatable pattern of acute bronchiolitis that has been termed fibrosing bronchiolitis. MAIN RESULTS We report three patients with respiratory failure and acute onset of probable infectious or inhalational bronchiolitis that was characterized by centrilobular nodules and a variable tree-in-bud appearance on computed tomography. All patients showed an uncommon pattern of bronchiolitis on surgical lung biopsy. The pathologic abnormalities were confined to the bronchioles and consisted of reepithelialized, partially collagenized and variably polypoid plugs of granulation tissue that narrowed the bronchiolar lumens. All three patients improved dramatically on immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSIONS These cases of fibrosing bronchiolitis represent an uncommon pattern of acute bronchiolitis that is reversible if detected at an early stage. Early recognition and treatment may prevent development of permanent bronchiolar fibrosis.","Ryerson, Christopher J; Olsen, Sharla-Rae; Carlsten, Chris; Donagh, Carol; Bilawich, Ana Maria; Field, Stephen K; Churg, Andrew",Annals of the American Thoracic Society,https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.201504-234bc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26153612/,136
112102,Supporting the NHS using intense transformational change in a charitable specialist palliative care provider.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Radial artery (RA) is widely used in coronary artery bypass (CABG) surgery and the prevention of spasm is crucial for graft patency. Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) and B are commonly used for aesthetic reasons and neuromuscular disorders. They are proven to raise blood flow and increase survival of ischemic skin flaps. In this study we evaluated and compared the vasodilator effects of BTX-A and papaverine on human RA grafts. METHODS After resting 60 min in isolated organ baths, human RA grafts were examined. Contraction responses for different doses of serotonin (5-HT) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) were evaluated as a percent of maximum contraction response elicited by 80 mM potassium chloride (KCl). The inhibitory effects of BTX-A and papaverine on contraction responses taken at the 0th hour were compared with the 1st and 2nd hour responses. Inhibitory effects of BTX-A and papaverine against the contractile agent were evaluated by comparing the results of the first and last (0th and 2nd hour) application. RESULTS In low concentrations, when we compared the effects of BTX-A (10- 8 M) and papaverine (10- 6 M) on 5-HT, papaverine was found to be more effective at both the 0th and 2nd hour (p < 0.05). Both BTX-A and papaverine inhibited the maximum contractile effect of ET-1 to the same extent at the 0th hour; but, the inhibitory effect of BTX-A was significantly stronger at the 2nd hour (p < 0.05). In high concentrations, when we compared the effects of BTX-A (10- 6 M) and papaverine (10- 4 M) on 5-HT, papaverine showed stronger inhibition (p < 0.05), whereas both agents had similar action of inhibition on ET-1 mediated maximum contraction responses. CONCLUSION BTX-A inhibits both ET-1 and 5-HT induced contractions and its effectiveness does not decrease over time as observed with papaverine. This study is the first in the literature using human RA for prevention of vasospasm by BTX-A.","Tanyeli, Omer; Duman, Ipek; Dereli, Yuksel; Gormus, Niyazi; Toy, Hatice; Sahin, Ayse Saide",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13019-019-0837-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665449/,136

For VATS lung resection, endoscopic staplers are routinely used. Recently, a new generation of electronically powered stapling systems was developed. In this study, the iDrive powered stapling system (Covidien, Germany) was first tested during VATS-LVRS and compared with a non-electronic conventional device. METHODS Forty patients with advanced emphysema were enrolled in a prospective randomized trial. All patients underwent bilateral VATS-LVRS. Patients were randomized for iDrive use on the right lung (n = 20) or left lung resection (n = 20). A conventional endoscopic stapler (EndoGIA, Covidien) was used for contralateral resection in same patients. Therefore, 40 resections were performed with the iDrive and 40 with the EndoGIA. The duration of surgery, air leakage after extubation, and on postoperative day 1 (POD1), as well as length of chest tube therapy, were documented. RESULTS The application of the new system was uneventful. Mean duration of surgery was 52 ± 2.5 minute in the iDrive group compared with 54 ± 3.8 minute in the EndoGIA-group (p = 0.5). After extubation, the mean air leakage in the iDrive-group did not differ significantly from that in the EndoGIA-group (p = 0.6). This was also observed on POD1 (p = 0.7). Moreover, length of drainage therapy also did not show significant differences between both groups (p = 0.6). CONCLUSION The iDrive powered stapling system offers one-handed, push-button operation, which eliminates the manual firing force and possibly enables more precise resection. In the current study, the novel system led to comparable results with the conventional mechanical stapler without any disadvantages in patients undergoing bilateral VATS-LVRS.","Akil, Ali; Semik, Michael; Freermann, Stefan; Reichelt, Jan; Redwan, Bassam; Görlich, Dennis; Fischer, Stefan",The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0037-1606313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28905341/,136

After their synthesis Gn and Gc form a heterodimer in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transit to the Golgi compartment for virus assembly. The N-terminal half of the Gc ectodomain was previously shown to be dispensable for virus replication in cell culture (X. Shi, J. Goli, G. Clark, K. Brauburger, and R. M. Elliott, J. Gen. Virol. 90:2483-2492, 2009.). In this study, the coding sequence for a fluorescent protein, either enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) or mCherry fluorescent protein, was fused to the N terminus of truncated Gc, and two recombinant BUNVs (rBUNGc-eGFP and rBUNGc-mCherry) were rescued by reverse genetics. The recombinant viruses showed bright autofluorescence under UV light and were competent for replication in various mammalian cell lines. rBUNGc-mCherry was completely stable over 10 passages, whereas internal, in-frame deletions occurred in the chimeric Gc-eGFP protein of rBUNGc-eGFP, resulting in loss of fluorescence between passages 5 and 7. Autofluorescence of the recombinant viruses allowed visualization of different stages of the infection cycle, including virus attachment to the cell surface, budding of virus particles in Golgi membranes, and virus-induced morphological changes to the Golgi compartment at later stages of infection. The fluorescent protein-tagged viruses will be valuable reagents for live-cell imaging studies to investigate virus entry, budding, and morphogenesis in real time.","Shi, Xiaohong; van Mierlo, Joël T; French, Andrew; Elliott, Richard M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00902-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20573824/,136

The latter is associated with a variety of hyperkinetic disorders that are rare but disabling and potentially preventable. We conducted a systematic review of the potential association between diabetic retinopathy and the risk and prognosis of hyperkinetic disorders in patients with diabetes. We identified a total of 461 articles and 147 were eligible for review. Nine out of 147 articles (6.12%) reported 13 patients with information on diabetic retinopathy. Glycemic fluctuations were present at onset in 10 patients (77%) and retinopathy was present in nine of them (69.23%). The degree of retinopathy was reported in four patients. Two had severe, bilateral proliferative retinopathy, one had moderate-to-severe non-proliferative retinopathy and one had non-proliferative retinopathy. In the nine patients with retinopathy, hyperkinesia persisted, required higher doses of dopamine receptor antagonists or deep brain stimulation. Retinopathy was absent in four cases (30.77%). In these patients, hyperkinesia resolved spontaneously or with lower doses of dopamine receptor antagonists. Diabetic retinopathy could be an indirect marker of striatopallidal microangiopathy in patients with diabetes. The severity of retinopathy may be associated with increased risk or worse prognosis for patients who develop hyperkinetic disorders of the diabetic striatopathy spectrum. Early detection of retinopathy could identify patients in which avoiding glycemic fluctuations may prevent the development of striatopathy and hyperkinetic disorders.","Lizarraga, Karlo J; Chunga, Natalia; Yannuzzi, Nicolas A; Flynn, Harry W; Singer, Carlos; Lang, Anthony E",Parkinsonism & related disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.parkreldis.2020.10.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069611/,136

TLH had a higher intraoperative cost, but a lower postoperative cost than FTOH (AUD$3877 vs AUD$2776 P < 0.001, AUD$3965 vs AUD$6233 P < 0.001). The total cost of TLH was not different from FTOH (AUD$7842 vs AUD$9009 P = 0.068) and after a learning curve; TLH cost less than FTOH (AUD$6797 vs AUD$8647, P < 0.001). The use of high-energy devices did not impact on the cost benefit of TLH, and hospital case-weight-based funding correlated poorly with actual cost. CONCLUSION Despite the use of fast-track recovery protocols, the cost of TLH is no different to FTOH and after a learning curve is cheaper than open hysterectomy. Judicious use of advanced energy devices does not impact on the cost, and hospital case-weight-based funding model in our hospital is inaccurate when compared to directly calculated hospital costs.","Rhou, Yoon J J; Pather, Selvan; Loadsman, John A; Campbell, Neil; Philp, Shannon; Carter, Jonathan",The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajo.12093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23634987/,136

Lack of training has been cited as a barrier to telehealth adoption. PURPOSE This study evaluated provider adoption of telehealth based on the type of telehealth education received. METHODS A quantitative survey of telehealth providers (n = 224) was distributed through the listservs of 4 national organizations to determine whether there was a significant difference in provider levels of perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, perceived knowledge, satisfaction, and use of telehealth based on the type of telehealth education received. RESULTS Telehealth adoption was significantly associated with the type of telehealth education received (vendor, online, written instructions only, and on the spot). CONCLUSION With telehealth utilization expected to endure postpandemic, faculty should incorporate the most effective telehealth education methods into APRN curricula, ensuring successful adoption by the future workforce.","Garber, Kelli; Gustin, Tina",Nurse educator,https://doi.org/10.1097/nne.0000000000001103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34628435/,136
122554,Early Interventions Following the Death of a Parent: Protocol of a Mixed Methods Systematic Review.,2017,"Objective: To investigate the relationship between novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) and kidney injury. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on COVID-19 confirmed patients in the Central Theater Command General Hospital of Chinese PLA on March 12, 2020. A total of 87 hospitalized COVID-19 confirmed patients were enrolled in the study, and they were hospitalized at least one week. The recorded information included clinical data and indicators of kidney-related laboratory tests. Results: The average age of patients was (65.2±17.1) years, and 34.5% (30/87) patients were ≥ 75 years old and 31.0% (27/87) patients were 60~74 years old. Male and female patients accounted for 59.8% (52/87) and 40.2% (35/87), respectively. There were 29.9% (26/87) and 12.6% (11/87) patients who had already showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) at admission. Moreover, 25.3% (22/87) and 4.6% (4/87) patients still exhibited mild elevation of BUN and SCr one week after admission. However, 28.7% (25/87) patients showed an elevation of BUN one week later after admission, though their BUN levels were normal at admission. Likewise, 16.1% (14/87) patients showed an elevation of SCr one week later after admission, while their SCr levels were normal at admission. Only two patients had an increase of SCr ≥26.5 μmol/L, and both of them were over 75 years old. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with severe acute kidney injury are uncommon. However, attention should be paid to acute kidney injury of the elderly patients in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","Liu, Y; Qi, F Y; Wei, L; Cheng, Q L",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20200409-01143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418377/,136

Those in the treatment group (n=259) received 0.1 mg halofuginone base per kg bodyweight daily in a 10 ml solution, for the first seven days following birth, while those in the control group (n=254) received an equal volume of a placebo solution. Faecal samples were collected weekly from all calves until three weeks of age to test for Cryptosporidium oocysts and to assess the diarrhoeal status. Growth parameters of the calves were also recorded at approximately four months of age. Calves that received halofuginone were significantly less likely to shed Cryptosporidium oocysts during the course of the study than placebo-treated calves (odds ratio 0.6, 95 per cent confidence interval 0.4 to 0.9, P=0.009). Mean growth measurements of calves in the treated group were consistently higher than those of the control calves (hipometer-derived P=0.052, wither height P=0.097) and mortality was lower in the treated group (P=0.07). However, these differences were not statistically significant (P>0.05).

This study aims to determine the underlying mechanisms of corticosteroid treatment for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation and ALI. We used corticosteroid treatment for LPS-induced murine ALI model to investigate the effect of corticosteroid on ALI in vivo. Moreover, LPS-stimulated macrophages were used to explore the specific anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids on NLRP3-inflammasome in vitro. We found corticosteroids attenuated LPS-induced ALI, which manifested in reduction of the alveolar structure destruction, the infiltration of neutrophils and the inflammatory cytokines release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) in Lung. In vitro, when NLRP3-inflammasome was knocked out, inflammatory response of caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion was obviously declined. Further exploration, our results showed that when corticosteroid preprocessed macrophages before LPS primed, it obviously inhibited the activation of caspase-1 and the maturation of IL-1β, which depended on inhibiting the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signal pathway activation. However, when corticosteroids intervened the LPS-primed macrophages, it also negatively regulated NLRP3-inflammasome activation through suppressing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production. Our results revealed that corticosteroids played a protection role in LPS-induced inflammation and ALI by suppressing both NF-κB signal pathway and mtROS-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation.","Yang, Jia-Wei; Mao, Bei; Tao, Ru-Jia; Fan, Li-Chao; Lu, Hai-Wen; Ge, Bao-Xue; Xu, Jin-Fu",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcmm.15849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977368/,136

PURPOSE This article describes the process and results of mapping student competencies gained via virtual patient simulation experiences to a program's end-of-program outcomes and accrediting standards. METHODS A faculty team followed the process of curriculum mapping as described in the literature to evaluate the effectiveness of the program's virtual clinical learning product in addressing end-of-program outcomes. RESULTS The mapping process identified where competencies were being met, which needed enhancing or were redundant, and where gaps existed. CONCLUSIONS Curriculum mapping is an effective strategy in evaluating whether virtual patient simulation learning experiences support end-of-program outcomes. Mapping learning activities to outcomes will be fundamental to curriculum development and evaluation as schools of nursing integrate accrediting standards.","Altmiller, Gerry; Alexy, Eileen; Dzubaty, Dolores; Jakubowski, Tami; Kartoz, Connie R",Nurse educator,https://doi.org/10.1097/nne.0000000000001107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34628434/,136

Optimisation can be defined as a deliberate, iterative and data-driven process to improve a health intervention and/or its implementation to meet stakeholder-defined public health impacts within resource constraints. This study aimed to identify frameworks used to optimise the impact of health interventions and/or their implementation, and characterise the key concepts, steps or processes of identified frameworks. METHODS A scoping review of MEDLINE, CINAL, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Nursing & Allied Health Source databases was undertaken. Two reviewers independently coded the key concepts, steps or processes involved in each frameworks, and identified if it was a framework aimed to optimise interventions or their implementation. Two review authors then identified the common steps across included frameworks. RESULTS Twenty optimisation frameworks were identified. Eight frameworks were for optimising interventions, 11 for optimising implementation and one covered both intervention and implementation optimisation. The mean number of steps within the frameworks was six (range 3-9). Almost half (n = 8) could be classified as both linear and cyclic frameworks, indicating that some steps may occur multiple times in a single framework. Two meta-frameworks are proposed, one for intervention optimisation and one for implementation strategy optimisation. Steps for intervention optimisation are: Problem identification; Preparation; Theoretical/Literature base; Pilot/Feasibility testing; Optimisation; Evaluation; and Long-term implementation. Steps for implementation strategy optimisation are: Problem identification; Collaborate; Plan/design; Pilot; Do/change; Study/evaluate/check; Act; Sustain/endure; and Disseminate/extend. CONCLUSIONS This review provides a useful summary of the common steps followed to optimise a public health intervention or its implementation according to established frameworks. Further opportunities to study and/or validate such frameworks and their impact on improving outcomes exist.","McCrabb, Sam; Mooney, Kaitlin; Elton, Benjamin; Grady, Alice; Yoong, Sze Lin; Wolfenden, Luke",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09950-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33267844/,136

The study is aimed at evaluating the effect of curcumin gel on serum levels of micronutrients (zinc, copper, and magnesium) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) in chronic periodontitis patients. Ninety subjects with an age of 25-54 were included in this study. From the total number, 30 subjects with healthy periodontium (control group) (mean age = 37.30 ± 7.08) were employed for the sole purpose of obtaining the normal mean values of clinical, chemical, and immunological parameters, and 60 with chronic periodontitis (mean age = 36.73 ± 6.22) were divided randomly into 2 groups, of which each group included 30 subjects. Group A received scaling and root planing SRP and curcumin gel injection covered by Coe pack for 7 days, and group B received SRP alone covered by Coe pack. Clinical parameters (plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and clinical attachment loss measurements) and blood samples were collected before and after 1 month of treatment to measure serum levels of zinc, copper, magnesium, IL-1β, and TNF-α. The results showed significant micronutrient alteration and increase of proinflammatory cytokines in the chronic periodontitis group as compared to healthy control (P ≤ 0.05), and curcumin gel had a significant effect on the reduction of IL-1β, TNF-α, copper, and clinical parameters (P ≤ 0.05) and increase of zinc and magnesium levels after 1 month as compared to baseline (P ≤ 0.05), nearly the same pattern for group B but with nonsignificant differences for Zn (P > 0.05).

133948,Reflections on a Real-Time Advance Care Planning Discussion During Our First Virtual Teaching Rounds in Post-Acute Care.,2020-12-28,"OBJECTIVES To explore community pharmacies' experience with two models of distribution for publicly-funded influenza vaccines in Ontario, Canada-one being publicly-managed (2015-2016 influenza season) and one involving private pharmaceutical distributors (2016-2017 season). METHODS Online surveys were distributed to community pharmacies across Ontario during the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 influenza seasons with sampling proportional to Ontario Public Health Unit catchment populations. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively and inferentially and qualitative data were summarized for additional context. RESULTS Order fulfillment appeared more responsive with the addition of private distributors in 2016-2017, as more pharmacies reported shorter order fulfillment times (p < 0.01); however, pharmacies reported significantly more days with zero on-hand inventory in 2016-2017 (p < 0.01), as well as more instances of patients being turned away due to vaccine unavailability (p < 0.05). In both seasons, a similar proportion of pharmacies reported slower order fulfillment and limited order quantities early in the season. Improved availability early in the season when patient demand is highest, more vaccines in a pre-filled syringe format, and better communication from distributors on product availability dates were recommended in qualitative responses. CONCLUSIONS Introducing private distributors for the management and fulfillment of pharmacies' orders for the publicly funded influenza vaccine appeared to have mixed results. While key concerns surrounding the frequency, responsiveness, and method of delivery were addressed by this change, challenges remain-in particular, acquiring sufficient vaccine early in the season to meet patient demand. As pharmacies become more prominent as vaccination sites, there are several opportunities to ensure that patient demand is met in this setting.","Fonseca, Joseph; Violette, Richard; Houle, Sherilyn K D; Waite, Nancy M",Pharmacy,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy9020094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33923195/,136

The feasibility and safety of TLH for very large uteri without the use of uterine manipulator has not yet been established. Results We describe two emblematic cases of TLH for huge fibromatous uteri: the first one for a uterus weighing 5700 g, which is the largest uterus laparoscopically removed to date reported in literature, and the second one for a uterus of 3670 g associated with a severe lymph node neoplastic disease.In both cases, TLH was successfully and safely performed even without the use of uterine manipulator, thus allowing a rapid recovery, especially in the second case, which was essential for a fast start of the most appropriate oncological treatment, the best quality of life and undoubtedly cosmetic advantages. Conclusions Although we believe in the great usefulness of the uterine manipulator in performing TLH for huge uteri, in the present paper, we demonstrate the feasibility and safety of such complex surgery also when the use of this tool is not possible due to unfavorable anatomical condition.","Macciò, Antonio; Madeddu, Clelia; Kotsonis, Paraskevas; Chiappe, Giacomo; Lavra, Fabrizio; Collu, Ivan; Demontis, Roberto",Gynecological surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s10397-018-1037-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29568253/,136

Various treatments have been evaluated over the years. However, a clear overview is lacking. The objective of this study was to systematically review all pharmacotherapeutical strategies in the prevention of VOCs beyond hydroxyurea. We performed a systematic literature search (MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL). Eligible studies were controlled clinical trials evaluating pharmacotherapeutical interventions targeting the reduction of VOCs in patients with SCD. Primary outcomes were the number or duration of SCD-related pain days, VOCs, or hospital admissions for VOCs. Secondary outcomes included time to first VOC or hospital admission for a VOC. A standardized data extraction sheet was used. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using Cochrane's risk-of-bias tool. A total of 36 studies were included in this review, covering 26 different prophylactic interventions. The most promising interventions for reducing the frequency of either VOCs or hospitalizations were the oral antioxidants l-glutamine and ω-3 fatty acids and the IV antiadhesive agent crizanlizumab. Twenty-three studies did not show any beneficial effect of the intervention under investigation, and 6 studies were either too small or methodologically inadequate to draw conclusions. Because of the heterogeneity of interventions, no meta-analysis was performed. In conclusion, this review identified 3 promising pharmacotherapeutical strategies in the prevention of VOCs in SCD.

The results of curative effect show that TCM could significantly alleviate symptoms, control disease and tendency, reduce the occurrence of critical illness, and improve the clinical efficacy and the prognosis and quality of life of patients, which fully reflects the consciousness and self-confidence of traditional Chinese medicine workers. For the evidence-based evaluation of TCM intervention in new public health emergencies, the basic principles and general methods of clinical epidemiology and evidence-based medicine shall be followed to obtain high-quality evidence; besides, we shall also fully realize that clinical scientific study is carried out with the epidemic treatment as the primary task. The scientific hypothesis comes from the clinical problems unsolved. The scientific study conclusions aim to give feedbacks to clinical diagnosis and treatment regimens. The core elements of clinical trials are population(P), intervention(I), control(C), outcome(O), which are abbreviated as ""PICO"". The evaluation of intervention measures for new public health emergencies with traditional Chinese medicine shall have clear study objectives and a high quality, with a correct analysis method as the guarantee of real and reliable results. Then, the selection of patients, the de-finition of intervention measures and control measures, the development of end-point indicators, the clinical quality control under special epidemics, the data verification, and the data analysis methods to be adopted are all characteristics and key points that need special consideration. It is suggested that scientific experimental design, rigorous collection and scientific data analysis shall be conducted to reflect the therapeutic value of traditional Chinese medicine, so that the study results could be adopted and shared, and become the scientific evidence for China and even the global to republish the diagnosis and treatment regimens.","Wang, Lian-Xin; Xie, Yan-Ming",Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,https://doi.org/10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200318.501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32495582/,136
138294,Anthropometric cut-offs to identify hyperglycemia in an Afro-Caribbean population: a cross-sectional population-based study from Barbados.,2021-08-01,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is associated with production inefficiencies in domestic fowl, and causes massive economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. Progress has been made in designing novel and efficient candidate vaccines to control IBV infection. BacMam virus, a modified baculovirus mediating transgene expression under the control of a mammalian promoter, has emerged as a versatile and safe vector during vaccine development. In previous work, we generated the BacMam virus Ac-CMV-S1, which expressed the S1 glycoprotein of IBV-M41. We showed that Ac-CMV-S1 induced excellent cellular immunity, but did not confer adequate protection in chickens compared with the conventional inactivated vaccine. In the current study, we generated an improved BacMam virus, BV-Dual-S1. This virus displayed the S1 glycoprotein on the baculovirus envelope, and was capable of expressing it in mammalian cells. BV-Dual-S1 elicited stronger humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, and showed greater capacity for induction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, compared with Ac-CMV-S1 in specific pathogen-free chickens. A significant difference was not observed for protection rates between chickens immunized with BV-Dual-S1 (83%) or inactivated vaccine (89%) following challenge with virulent IBV-M41. Our findings show that the protective efficacy of BV-Dual-S1 could be significantly enhanced by baculovirus display technology. BacMam virus-based surface display strategies could serve as effective tools in designing vaccines against IB and other infectious diseases.","Zhang, Jie; Chen, Xiao-Wei; Tong, Tie-Zhu; Ye, Yu; Liao, Ming; Fan, Hui-Ying",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.12.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24342247/,136

Effective assessment of biomarker performances are needed to evaluate their clinical usefulness and translation. We defined a realistic ground-truth scenario and compared the effectiveness of different biomarkers alone and combined to localize epileptogenic tissue during surgery. We investigated the performances of univariate, bivariate and multivariate signal biomarkers applied to 1 min inter-ictal intra-operative electrocorticography to discriminate between epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic locations in 47 drug-resistant people with epilepsy (temporal and extra-temporal) who had been seizure-free one year after the operation. The best result using a single biomarker was obtained using the phase-amplitude coupling measure for which the epileptogenic tissue was localized in 17 out of 47 patients. Combining the whole set of biomarkers provided an improvement of the performances: 27 out of 47 patients. Repeating the analysis only on the temporal-lobe resections we detected the epileptogenic tissue in 29 out of 30 combining all the biomarkers. We suggest that the assessment of biomarker performances on a ground-truth scenario is required to have a proper estimate on how biomarkers translate into clinical use. Phase-amplitude coupling seems the best performing single biomarker and combining biomarkers improves localization of epileptogenic tissue. Performance achieved is not adequate as a tool in the operation theater yet, but it can improve the understanding of pathophysiological process.","Demuru, Matteo; Kalitzin, Stiliyan; Zweiphenning, Willemiek; van Blooijs, Dorien; Van't Klooster, Maryse; Van Eijsden, Pieter; Leijten, Frans; Zijlmans, Maeike",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71359-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887896/,136
143167,"Intimacy for older adults in long-term care: a need, a right, a privilege-or a kind of care?",2021-06-23,"INTRODUCTION Using ultrasound to measure optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) has been shown to be a useful modality to detect elevated intracranial pressure. However, manual assessment of ONSD by a human operator is cumbersome and prone to human error. We aimed to develop and test an automated algorithm for ONSD measurement using ultrasound images and compare it to measurements performed by physicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients were recruited from the Neurological Intensive Care Unit. Ultrasound images of the optic nerve sheath from both eyes were obtained using an ultrasound unit with an ocular preset. Images were processed by two attending physicians to calculate ONSD manually. The images were processed as well using a novel computerized algorithm that automatically analyzes ultrasound images and calculates ONSD. Algorithm-measured ONSD was compared to manually measured ONSD using multiple statistical measures. RESULTS Forty-Four patients with an average/standard deviation (SD) intracranial pressure of 14(9.7) mm Hg were recruited and tested (with a range between 1 and 57 mm Hg). A t-test showed no statistical difference between the ONSD from left and right eyes (P > 0.05). Furthermore, a paired t-test showed no significant difference between the manual and algorithm measure ONSD with a mean difference (SD) of 0.012(0.046) cm (P > 0.05) and percentage error of difference of 6.43% (P = 0.15). Agreement between the two operators was highly correlated (Interclass Correlation coefficient = 0.8, P = 0.26). Bland-Altman analysis revealed mean difference (SD) of 0.012 (0.046) (P = 0.303) and limits of agreement between -0.1 and 0.08. Receiver operator curve analysis yielded an area under the curve of 0.965 (P < 0.0001) with high sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS The automated image-analysis algorithm calculates ONSD reliably and with high precision when compared to measurements obtained by expert physicians. The algorithm may have a role in computer-aided decision support systems in acute brain injury.","Rajajee, Venkatakrishna; Soroushmehr, Reza; Williamson, Craig A; Najarian, Kayvan; Gryak, Jonathan; Awad, Abdelrahman; Ward, Kevin R; Tiba, Mohamad H",Military medicine,https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usaa231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830251/,136
144644,Coronavirus-19 in Geriatrics and Long-Term Care: An Update.,2020-04-03,"We examined spike (S) gene sequences of the virus populations of four different commercial ArkDPI-derived infectious bronchitis coronavirus vaccines before and during a single passage in specific pathogen free chickens. We found different degrees of genetic heterogeneity among the four vaccines before passage in chickens, ranging from no apparent heterogeneity to heterogeneity in 20 positions in the S gene. In all except one position, nucleotide differences were non-synonymous. The majority of amino acid differences were in the S1 subunit of the protein. For three of the four ArkDPI-derived vaccines, a single subpopulation with an S gene sequence distinct from the vaccine majority consensus at 5 to 11 codons was selected in chickens within 3 days after ocular vaccination. In contrast, we obtained no evidence for selection of specific subpopulations of the fourth ArkDPI-derived vaccine or Massachusetts or DE072 serotype vaccines. The virus subpopulations within each vaccine selected by chickens are similar in their S1 gene sequences, but distinct in the 3' portion of the S2 subunit gene for each of the three vaccines. In the S1 gene, the selected subpopulations are more similar to the virulent parental ArkDPI isolate than to the predominant vaccine population. The different proportions of distinct subpopulations in Ark vaccines apparently more fit for replication in the respiratory tract of chickens might cause different degrees of damage to respiratory epithelium and/or immune responses in vaccinated chickens. Sequence comparisons provided no evidence to support that ArkDPI-like field isolates were derived directly from host-selected vaccine virus subpopulations.","van Santen, Vicky L; Toro, Haroldo",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079450802043783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18568656/,136
144876,Use of community-based interventions to promote family planning use among pastoralist women in Ethiopia: cluster randomized controlled trial.,2021-08-18,"AIMS Major depressive disorder, as a destructive mental health disorder, is a major contributor to disability and death. Numerous studies have illustrated that activation of inflammation and fluctuating immune reactions play a crucial role in the physiopathology of depression. The effectiveness of antidepressants is affected by the intensity of the inflammatory response. Thus, we aim to reveal the correlation of inflammatory factors and depression. MAIN METHODS Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ™)-based proteomics was applied to verify the quantitation of target proteins in the PFC of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model mice. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was performed to explore related pathways, and the involvement of molecules was validated by western blotting and real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). KEY FINDINGS According to the IPA results, CSDS-susceptible mice and CSDS-resilient mice both exhibited alterations of the inflammasome pathway in the PFC. Compared with control mice, susceptible mice subjected to CSDS showed an increased ATP-activated purinergic receptor P2X7 (also known as P2RX7) protein level. Nevertheless, the expression levels of cysteinyl aspartate-specific protease 1 (Caspase 1) and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) were reduced in CSDS mice, and downregulation of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) was found in susceptible mice. Moreover, no significant difference was found in nuclear factor-κB levels among the three groups. SIGNIFICANCE CSDS administration leads to dysfunctions of key molecules in the inflammasome pathway, promoting depressive-like behaviors in mice.","Lan, Tianlan; Bai, Mengge; Chen, Xiangyu; Wang, Yue; Li, Yan; Tian, Yu; He, Yong; Wu, Zhonghao; Yu, Heming; Chen, Zhi; Chen, Chong; Yu, Yaping; Cheng, Ke; Xie, Peng",Life sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991880/,136

145326,Infectious disease considerations in immunocompromised patients.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is one of the most frequently performed procedures in obesity surgery. The benefits of minimally invasive surgery include rapid recovery. We evaluated the clinical outcomes of different resection margin lengths from the pylorus in LSG. METHODS This retrospective study included 152 patients who underwent LSG from January 2011 to October 2014. The antrum was resected 2 cm from the pylorus in 84 patients (group A) and 6 cm from the pylorus in 68 patients (group B). The patients' demographics, staple line distance, complications, sex, age, body mass index loss, length of hospital stay, and comorbidities were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS The patients comprised 104 women (68.4 %) and 48 men (32.6 %) with a mean age of 41.2 years (range, 28-53 years). The percent total and excess weight loss were statistically significant in both groups at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Weight loss was significantly greater in group A than that in B at 6 and 12 months, but the difference at 24 months was not statistically significant. The results of pH monitoring showed significantly lower scores in group A than those in B at 6 and 12 months, but no difference at 24 months. CONCLUSION LSG is an effective procedure with good short-term outcomes. Both procedures described herein are equally effective with respect to the patient's return to daily activities. Increasing the distance from the resection line to the pylorus is associated with better weight loss but slightly increased symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease without a significant difference in complications.","Yormaz, Serdar; Yılmaz, Huseyin; Ece, Ilhan; Yılmaz, Farise; Sahin, Mustafa",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-016-2384-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27696100/,136

Data sources Four databases were searched from inception to December 20th, 2019. Review methods Systematic or scoping reviews examining patient experience in seeking care for musculoskeletal from healthcare providers and the healthcare system were included. Independent authors screened and selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality of the reviews. Patient experience concepts were compiled into five themes from a perspective of a) relational and b) functional aspects. A list of mechanisms used to capture the patient experience was also collected. Results Thirty reviews were included (18 systematic and 12 scoping reviews). Relational aspects were reported in 29 reviews and functional aspects in 25 reviews. For relational aspects, the most prevalent themes were ""information needs"" (education and explanation on diseases, symptoms, and self-management strategies) and ""understanding patient expectations"" (respect and empathy). For functional aspects, the most prevalent themes were patient's ""physical and environmental needs,"" (cleanliness, safety, and accessibility of clinics), and ""trusted expertise,"" (healthcare providers' competence and clinical skills to provide holistic care). Interviews were the most frequent mechanism identified to collect patient experience. Conclusions Measuring patient experience provides direct insights about the patient's perspectives and may help to promote better patient-centered health services and increase the quality of care. Areas of improvement identified were interpersonal skills of healthcare providers and logistics of health delivery, which may lead to a more desirable patient-perceived experience and thus better overall healthcare outcomes.

There is a pandemic going on.,2020-11-01,"PURPOSE The aim of this study was to assess the capacity of two methods of surgical pancreatic stump closure in terms of reducing the risk of pancreatic fistula formation (POPF): radiofrequency-induced heating versus mechanical stapler. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixteen pigs underwent a laparoscopic transection of the neck of the pancreas. Pancreatic anastomosis was always avoided in order to work with an experimental model prone to POPF. Pancreatic stump closure was conducted either by stapler (ST group, n = 8) or radiofrequency energy (RF group, n = 8). Both groups were compared for incidence of POPF and histopathological alterations of the pancreatic remnant. RESULTS Six animals (75%) in the ST group and one (14%) in the RF group were diagnosed with POPF (p = 0.019). One animal in the RF group and three animals in the ST group had a pseudocyst in close contact with both pancreas stumps. On day 30 post-operation (PO), almost complete atrophy of the exocrine distal pancreas was observed when the main pancreatic duct was efficiently sealed. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that RF-induced heating is more effective at closing the pancreatic stump than mechanical stapler and leads to the complete atrophy of the distal remnant pancreas.","Burdío, Fernando; Dorcaratto, Dimitri; Hernandez, Lourdes; Andaluz, Anna; Moll, Xavier; Quesada, Rita; Poves, Ignasi; Grande, Luis; Cáceres, Marta; Berjano, Enrique","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.3109/02656736.2015.1136845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26821683/,136

In 2011, a novel Orthobunyavirus was discovered in northern Europe causing congenital malformations and abortions in ruminants. From field studies, Culicoides were implicated in the transmission of this virus which was subsequently named Schmallenberg virus (SBV), but to date no assessment of susceptibility to infection of field populations under standardised laboratory conditions has been carried out. We assessed the influence of membrane type (chick skin, collagen, Parafilm M®) when offered in conjunction with an artificial blood-feeding system (Hemotek, UK) on field-collected Culicoides blood-feeding rates. Susceptibility to infection with SBV following blood-feeding on an SBV-blood suspension provided via either (i) the Hemotek system or via (ii) a saturated cotton wool pledglet was then compared. Schmallenberg virus susceptibility was defined by RT-qPCR of RNA extractions of head homogenates and related to Culicoides species and haplotype identifications based on the DNA barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (cox1) gene. RESULTS Culicoides blood-feeding rates were low across all membrane types tested (7.5% chick skin, 0.0% for collagen, 4.4% Parafilm M®, with 6029 female Culicoides being offered a blood meal in total). Susceptibility to infection with SBV through membrane blood-feeding (8 of 109 individuals tested) and pledglet blood-feeding (1 of 94 individuals tested) was demonstrated for the Obsoletus complex, with both C. obsoletus (Meigen) and C. scoticus Downes & Kettle susceptible to infection with SBV through oral feeding. Potential evidence of cryptic species within UK populations was found for the Obsoletus complex in phylogenetic analyses of cox1 DNA barcodes of 74 individuals assessed from a single field-site. CONCLUSIONS Methods described in this study provide the means to blood-feed Palaearctic Culicoides for vector competence studies and colonisation attempts. Susceptibility to SBV infection was 7.3% for membrane-fed members of the subgenus Avaritia and 1.1% for pledglet-fed. Both C. obsoletus and C. scoticus were confirmed as being susceptible to infection with SBV, with potential evidence of cryptic species within UK Obsoletus complex specimens, however the implications of cryptic diversity in the Obsoletus complex on arbovirus transmission remains unknown.","Barber, James; Harrup, Lara E; Silk, Rhiannon; Veronesi, Eva; Gubbins, Simon; Bachanek-Bankowska, Katarzyna; Carpenter, Simon",Parasites & vectors,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2650-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29486789/,136

METHODS We reviewed the current literature regarding the safety and efficacy of flow diversion therapy for treatment of paraclinoid aneurysms. RESULTS Early results suggest excellent ability for flow diversion to remodel the diseased parent artery and achieve durable complete angiographic occlusion of the aneurysm with acceptable rates of peri-procedural risk. DISCUSSION Flow diversion therapy can achieve durable and high rates of obliteration that surpass traditional methods of management for paraclinoid aneurysms.

The link between these disorders persists even after the clinical symptoms of depression subside, as indicated by high levels of nicotine dependence among individuals with remitted depression (rMDD). Recent evidence indicates that individuals with rMDD show blunted responses to reward as measured by a probabilistic reward task (PRT), which assesses the ability to modify behavior as a function of reward history. Given nicotine's ability to enhance reward responsiveness, individuals with rMDD might smoke to address this persistent reward deficit. However, it is unclear whether smokers with rMDD show enhanced reward responsiveness relative to rMDD individuals who do not smoke. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated reward responsiveness on the PRT in four groups (N=198): individuals with and without rMDD who were or were not nicotine dependent. As hypothesized, rMDD nonsmokers had lower reward responsiveness relative to both control nonsmokers and rMDD smokers; conversely, smokers with rMDD showed behavioral patterns comparable to those without a history of depression. Given nicotine's ability to enhance reward sensitivity, it is possible that nicotine normalizes the otherwise blunted reward responsiveness in individuals with rMDD. Therapies aimed at enhancing this reward-based deficit may be beneficial in the treatment of both nicotine dependence and MDD.","Janes, Amy C; Pedrelli, Paola; Whitton, Alexis E; Pechtel, Pia; Douglas, Samuel; Martinson, Max A; Huz, Ilana; Fava, Maurizio; Pizzagalli, Diego A; Evins, A Eden",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1038/npp.2015.43; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25662839/,136

In a routine lab, these lesions accounted for less than 1% of the effusion fluids samples. However, they may represent around 30% of all the lymphoma diagnosis from effusion cytological samples and their consideration in the diagnostic flow chart is mandatory, especially in HIV-positive patients. METHODS The paper analyzes a retrospective series of cytological specimens from cavities effusions (N = 605). Five HHV8-related lymphoproliferative processes were recruited. A combination of morphological criteria (enhanced with MGG staining), cell block-based immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry is required for the final characterization. RESULTS The identification of malignant cells may be insidious. Some specimens are particularly rich, easily leading to suspect a lymphoproliferative process, whereas in the other cases the presence of abundant reactive mesothelial cells, histiocytes, neutrophils, small reactive T and B lymphocytes may obscure the neoplastic process. The biological behaviour may be very heterogeneous and a standardized therapy for these cases is still lacking, although some patients may benefit from the antiretroviral therapy in HIV-setting. CONCLUSIONS The present case series highlights some emblematic findings of these entities to reaffirm useful cytopathological diagnostic criteria, stressing the crucial role of the appropriate technical processing of effusion fluids to obtain the best performances.","Verga, Luisa; Leni, Davide; Cazzaniga, Giorgio; Crosta, Simona; Seminati, Davide; Rossi, Marianna; L'Imperio, Vincenzo; Pagni, Fabio",Cytopathology : official journal of the British Society for Clinical Cytology,https://doi.org/10.1111/cyt.12820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171033/,136

MATERIAL AND METHODS We treated 66 aneurysms in 43 patients with aneurysms less than 5 mm. Of the patients, 29 were females and 14 males (mean age: 50.2 years). Headache was the most frequent symptom. In 8 patients the aneurysms were recanalized and these had been treated with coils or stent-assisted coiling. All aneurysms were in the anterior circulation. In the treatment, one of the SILK, Pipeline, Derivo or FRED FD stents was used for each patient. Neurointerventional stent medication (double antiplatelet) was used. All patients were investigated for new ischemic lesions with diffusion-weighted imaging one day later. The first follow-up angiogram was planned 3-6 months later. RESULTS The treatment was technically successful in all patients. Minor complications occurred in 3 patients (7%). In one patient, thrombus inside the SILK was seen and was relieved with tirofiban. The second patient bled from the right common femoral artery entrance, which was operated on. In the third patient, the complication was technical. All patients were discharged without any neurological deficit. The mean follow-up period was 26 (6-52) months. Of the aneurysms, 64 (97.0%) were completely closed. CONCLUSION The FD treatment of cerebral, anterior circulation small aneurysms less than 5 mm is effective and safe.","Akgul, Erol; Onan, Hasan Bilen; Bİlgİn, Sabriye Sennur; Tahta, Alican; Khanmammadov, Elmir; Gungoren, Fatma Zeynep; Ertan, Gulhan; Erol, Cengiz; Sekerci, Zeki",Turkish neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.5137/1019-5149.jtn.28762-19.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32705668/,136

The purpose of the study was to present the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients admitted to the Military Medical Academy, Sofia, Bulgaria. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted for a period of 3 months from March 2020 to June 2020 on this infection in our hospital. All participants were laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19. RT-PCR was performed for etiological diagnosis. The hospitalized patients were divided into two groups on admission, that is, nonsevere and severe. Results: One hundred thirty-eight COVID-19 patients were hospitalized and analyzed during the study period. The mean age was 52.9 years. Male was the dominant sex (sex ratio: male/female = 1/0.6). The leading clinical signs were fever, fatigue, cough, and headache. On comparative analysis of both groups (nonsevere and severe) was measured significant elevation of white blood cells (odds ratio [OR] = 1.238; p value = 0.006), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.021; p < 0.001), creatinine (OR = 1.037; p < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (OR = 1.014; p = 0.040), lactate dehydrogenase (OR = 1.004; p < 0.001), ferritin (OR = 1.002; p < 0.001), fibrinogen (OR = 2.028; p < 0.001), and d-dimer (OR = 2.162; p = 0.002) in severe group than in nonsevere group. Interleukin 6 was tested in 17.4% of patients and high value was found-38.6 pg/mL (95% confidence interval: 16.5-60.7). Conclusion: The first Bulgarian retrospective study of COVID-19 hospitalized patients was presented. Older age, male sex, comorbidity, and signs of dyspnea and nausea were estimated as higher risk factors for severe form. Abnormality in inflammatory markers was associated with poor progression of the illness.","Popov, Georgi T; Baymakova, Magdalena; Vaseva, Virsavia; Kundurzhiev, Todor; Mutafchiyski, Ventsislav",Vector borne and zoonotic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2020.2679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33054699/,136

This review aimed to summarize the health benefits of T3, particularly in prevention or treatment of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, metabolic, gastric, and skin disorders, as well as cancers. Studies showed that T3 could prevent various NCDs, by suppressing 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) in the mevalonate pathway, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and alternating hormones. The efficacy of T3 in preventing/treating these NCDs is similar or greater compared to tocopherol (TF). TF may lower the efficacy of T3 because the efficacy of the combination of TF and T3 was lower than T3 alone in some studies. Data investigating the effects of T3 on osteoporosis, arthritis, and peptic ulcers in human are limited.

The descended cervix or vaginal vault is suspended with a synthetic mesh by fixing the bilateral mesh ends to the pectineal ligaments. This study was aimed at developing a learning curve for LP and to compare it with results with LS. METHODS We started laparoscopic/robotic pectopexy in our department in August 2019. This retrospective study included the initial 18 consecutive women with apical prolapse receiving LP and another group undergoing LS (21 cases) performed by the same surgeon. The medical and video records were reviewed. RESULTS The age was older in the LP group than in the LS group (65.2 vs 53.1 years). The operation time of LP group was significantly shorter than that of the LS group (182.9 ± 27.2 vs 256.2 ± 45.5 min, p < 0.001). The turning point of the LP learning curve was observed at the 12th case. No major complications such as bladder, ureteral, bowel injury or uncontrolled bleeding occurred in either group. Postoperative low back pain and defecation symptoms occurred exclusively in the LS group. During the follow-up period (mean 7.2 months in LP, 16.2 months in LS), none of the cases had recurrent apical prolapse. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic pectopexy is a feasible surgical method for apical prolapse, with a shorter operation time and less postoperative discomfort than LS. LP may overcome the steep learning curve of LS because the surgical field of LP is limited to the anterior pelvis and avoids encountering the critical organs.","Chuang, Fei Chi; Chou, Yu Min; Wu, Ling Ying; Yang, Tsai Hwa; Chen, Wen Hsin; Huang, Kuan Hui",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-021-04934-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34406417/,136

The Delphi technique was used to develop expert consensus recommendations about how to promote opioid safety in adults receiving PC in Canada and the USA. METHODS Through a Delphi process comprised of two rounds, USA and Canadian panellists in PC, addiction and pain medicine developed expert consensus recommendations. Elected Canadian Society of Palliative Care Physicians (CSPCP) board members then rated how important it is for PC physicians to be aware of each consensus recommendation.They also identified high-priority research areas from the topics that did not achieve consensus in Round 2. RESULTS The panellists (Round 1, n=23; Round 2, n=22) developed a total of 130 recommendations from the two rounds about the following six opioid-safety related domains: (1) General principles; (2) Measures for healthcare institution and PC training and clinical programmes; (3) Patient and caregiver assessments; (4) Prescribing practices; (5) Monitoring; and (6) Patients and caregiver education. Fifty-nine topics did not achieve consensus and were deemed potential areas of research. From these results, CSPCP identified 43 high-priority recommendations and 8 high-priority research areas. CONCLUSIONS Urgent guidance about opioid safety is needed to address the opioid crisis. These consensus recommendations can promote safer opioid use, while recognising the importance of these medications for PC symptom management.","Lau, Jenny; Mazzotta, Paolo; Whelan, Ciara; Abdelaal, Mohamed; Clarke, Hance; Furlan, Andrea D; Smith, Andrew; Husain, Amna; Fainsinger, Robin; Hui, David; Sunderji, Nadiya; Zimmermann, Camilla",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2021-003178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34389553/,136

Recent studies have deciphered the viral genome structure, epidemiology and are in the process of unveiling multiple mechanisms of pathogenesis. Apart from atypical pneumonia and lung disease manifestations, this disease has also been found to be associated with neurological symptoms, which include dizziness, headache, stroke, or seizures, among others. However, a possible direct or indirect association between SARS-CoV-2 and seizures is still not clear. In any manner, it may be of interest to analyze the drugs being used for viral infection in the background of epilepsy or vice versa. OBJECTIVE To identify the most credible drug candidate for COVID-19 in persons with epilepsy or COVID-19 patients experiencing seizures. METHODS A literature search for original and review articles was performed, and further, the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database was used to unearth the most credible drug candidate. RESULTS Our search based on common mechanistic targets affecting SARS-CoV-2 and seizures revealed ivermectin, dexamethasone, anakinra, and tocilizumab for protection against both COVID-19 and seizures. Amongst the antiseizure medications, we found valproic acid as the most probable pharmacotherapy for COVID-19 patients experiencing seizures. CONCLUSION These findings would hopefully provide the basis for initiating further studies on the pathogenesis and drug targeting strategies for this emerging infection accompanied with seizures or in people with epilepsy.","Goel, Divya; Srivastava, Ankit; Aledo-Serrano, Ángel; Krishnan, Anuja; Vohora, Divya",Current molecular pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.2174/1874467214666211013122528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34645381/,136
158001,A Narrative Literature Review on Human Resource Planning for Palliative Care Personnel.,2020,"Cisplatin is an efficient anticancer drug against various types of cancers however, its usage involves side effects. We investigated the mechanisms of action of indole derivative, 2-(5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-N'-[(E)-(3-nitrophenyl) methylidene] acetohydrazide (MMINA) against anticancer drug (cisplatin) induced organ damage using a rodent model. MMINA treatment reversed Cisplatin-induced NO and malondialdehyde (MDA) augmentation while boosted the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The animals were divided into five groups (n = 7). Group1: Control (Normal) group, Group 2: DMSO group, Group 3: cisplatin group, Group 4: cisplatin + MMINA group, Group 5: MMINA group. MMINA treatment normalized plasma levels of biochemical enzymes. We observed a significant decrease in CD4+COX-2, STAT3, and TNF-α cell population in whole blood after MMINA dosage. MMINA downregulated the expression of various signal transduction pathways regulating the genes involved in inflammation i.e. NF-κB, STAT-3, IL-1, COX-2, iNOS, and TNF-α. The protein expression of these regulatory factors was also downregulated in the liver, kidney, heart, and brain. In silico docking and dynamic simulations data were in agreement with the experimental findings. The physiochemical properties of MMINA predicted it as a good drug-like molecule and its mechanism of action is predictably through inhibition of ROS and inflammation.","Razak, Suhail; Afsar, Tayyaba; Bibi, Nousheen; Abulmeaty, Mahmoud; Qamar, Wajhul; Almajwal, Ali; Inam, Anam; Al Disi, Dara; Shabbir, Maria; Bhat, Mashooq Ahmad",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-84748-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737575/,136
158181,Mental Health Presentations to Christchurch Hospital Emergency Department During COVID-19 Lockdown.,2020-10-20,"Proline-rich domains (PRDs) are among the most prevalent signaling modules of eukaryotes but often unexplored by biophysical techniques as their heterologous recombinant expression poses significant difficulties. Using a ""divide-and-conquer"" approach, we present a detailed investigation of a PRD (166 residues; ∼30% prolines) belonging to a human protein ALIX, a versatile adaptor protein involved in essential cellular processes including ESCRT-mediated membrane remodeling, cell adhesion, and apoptosis. In solution, the N-terminal fragment of ALIX-PRD is dynamically disordered. It contains three tandem sequentially similar proline-rich motifs that compete for a single binding site on its signaling partner, TSG101-UEV, as evidenced by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Global fitting of relaxation dispersion data, measured as a function of TSG101-UEV concentration, allowed precise quantitation of these interactions. In contrast to the soluble N-terminal portion, the C-terminal tyrosine-rich fragment of ALIX-PRD forms amyloid fibrils and viscous gels validated using dye-binding assays with amyloid-specific probes, congo red and thioflavin T (ThT), and visualized by transmission electron microscopy. Remarkably, fibrils dissolve at low temperatures (2 to 6 °C) or upon hyperphosphorylation with Src kinase. Aggregation kinetics monitored by ThT fluorescence shows that charge repulsion dictates phosphorylation-mediated fibril dissolution and that the hydrophobic effect drives fibril formation. These data illuminate the mechanistic interplay between interactions of ALIX-PRD with TSG101-UEV and polymerization of ALIX-PRD and its central role in regulating ALIX function. This study also demonstrates the broad functional repertoires of PRDs and uncovers the impact of posttranslational modifications in the modulation of reversible amyloids.","Elias, Ruben D; Ma, Wen; Ghirlando, Rodolfo; Schwieters, Charles D; Reddy, Vijay S; Deshmukh, Lalit",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2010635117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917811/,136

Hyperinsulinemia, which characterizes IR, enhances sympathetic drive, and it can be hypothesized that IR is associated with impaired cardiac sympathetic innervation in HF. Yet, this hypothesis has never been investigated. Aim of the present observational study was to assess the relationship between IR and cardiac sympathetic innervation in non-diabetic HF patients. METHODS AND RESULTS One hundred and fifteen patients (87% males; 65 ± 11.3 years) with severe-to-moderate HF (ejection fraction 32.5 ± 9.1%) underwent iodine-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy to assess sympathetic innervation and Homeostasis Model Assessment Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) evaluation to determine the presence of IR. From (123)I-MIBG imaging, early and late heart to mediastinum (H/M) ratios and washout rate were calculated. Seventy-two (63%) patients showed IR and 43 (37%) were non-IR. Early [1.68 (IQR 1.53-1.85) vs. 1.79 (IQR 1.66-1.95); P = 0.05] and late H/M ratio [1.50 (IQR 1.35-1.69) vs. 1.65 (IQR 1.40-1.85); P = 0.020] were significantly reduced in IR compared with non-IR patients. Early and late H/M ratio showed significant inverse correlation with fasting insulinemia and HOMA-IR. CONCLUSION Cardiac sympathetic innervation is more impaired in patients with IR and HF compared with matched non-IR patients. These findings shed light on the relationship among IR, HF, and cardiac sympathetic nervous system. Additional studies are needed to clarify the pathogenetic relationship between IR and HF.","Paolillo, S; Rengo, G; Pellegrino, T; Formisano, R; Pagano, G; Gargiulo, P; Savarese, G; Carotenuto, R; Petraglia, L; Rapacciuolo, A; Perrino, C; Piscitelli, S; Attena, E; Del Guercio, L; Leosco, D; Trimarco, B; Cuocolo, A; Perrone-Filardi, P",European heart journal cardiovascular Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jev061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25845954/,136

The purpose of this study was to establish a model for minimal catheter diameters needed for ADAPT. MATERIALS AND METHODS We established a theoretic model for the calculation of minimal catheter diameters needed for ADAPT. We then verified its validity in 28 ADAPT maneuvers in a porcine in vivo model. To account for different mechanical thrombectomy techniques, we factored in ADAPT with/without a hypothetic 0.021-inch microcatheter or 0.014-inch microwire inside the lumen of the aspiration catheter and aspiration with a 60-mL syringe versus an aspiration pump. RESULTS According to our calculations, catheters with an inner diameter of >0.040 inch and >0.064 inch, respectively, are needed to be effective in the middle cerebral artery (2.5-mm diameter) or in the internal carotid artery (4 mm) in an average patient. There was a significant correlation between predicted and actual thrombectomy results (P = .010). Our theoretic model had a positive and negative predictive value of 78% and 79%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 64%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our theoretic model allows estimating the minimal catheter diameters needed for successful mechanical thrombectomy with ADAPT, as demonstrated by the good agreement with our animal experiments. Our model will be helpful to interventionalists in avoiding selecting catheters that are likely too small to be effective.","Nikoubashman, O; Nikoubashman, A; Büsen, M; Wiesmann, M",AJNR.

159542,Rapid evidence and gap map of virtual care solutions across a stepped care continuum for youth with chronic pain and their families in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-05-28,"AIM Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) was originally invented by Buess et al. (Chirurg, 1984, 55, 677-80) for the treatment of infraperitoneal rectal adenomas. Its indications have progressively expanded to include larger and more advanced lesions. The aim of the study was to report the results of TEM used for the treatment of circumferential rectal lesions. METHOD We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 17 consecutive patients [median age 69 (32-89) years; nine men] who underwent TEM for a circumferential rectal lesion in our department between September 2010 and January 2015. RESULTS The median distance from the anal verge was 4 (3-11) cm, the median longitudinal extent was 7 (3-10) cm and the median surface area was 75 (40-255) cm(2) . An end-to-end anastomosis without proximal bowel mobilization was completed endoscopically in all cases. The median operating time was 120 (40-240) min. Persistent, endoscopically uncontrollable endoluminal bleeding in one patient was successfully treated with a second TEM procedure. One patient underwent preoperative radiotherapy for adenocarcinoma detected at the preoperative assessment. Surgical histology showed a pT3 cancer in one patient who refused further surgery, a pT2 cancer in two who subsequently underwent abdominoperineal resection, a pT1 cancer in four and a ypT0 in one patient. All are at present free of disease. No patients developed faecal incontinence or urinary or sexual dysfunction. Four patients required endoscopic balloon dilatation for stenosis. CONCLUSION Transanal endoscopic microsurgery is a feasible and safe technique for large circumferential lesions with a satisfactory outcome. Preoperative staging may be inaccurate.","Arezzo, A; Arolfo, S; Allaix, M E; Bullano, A; Miegge, A; Marola, S; Morino, M",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.13279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26787535/,136

160557,Specialist palliative care services for older people in primary care: A systematic review using narrative synthesis.,2019,"BACKGROUND The proliferation of mHealth solutions and eRecord systems is inevitable in developing countries, and ensuring their bi-directional interoperability is essential. Interoperability has been described as the ability for two or more systems or components to exchange information and use the information that has been exchanged. Given the importance of linking mHealth solutions to eRecord systems in the developing world, a suitable interoperability framework is required to provide an agreed approach to interoperability and specify common elements. Although eHealth interoperability frameworks exist in the literature, none meet all the requirements for linking mHealth solutions to eRecord systems in developing countries. The aim of this paper was to describe the design and development of a conceptual framework for linking mHealth solutions to eRecord systems in Botswana, as an exemplar. METHODS An iterative and reflective process was adopted, supported by existing literature and research including consultations with eHealth experts, and guidance from existing frameworks. These collectively identified key elements, concepts, and standards relevant and essential for framework design and development. RESULTS The mHealth-eRecord Interoperability Framework (mHeRIF) was developed which highlights the need for: governance and regulation of mHealth and eRecord systems, a national health information exchange, and which interoperability levels to achieve. Each of these are supported by integral themes and concepts. It also addresses the need for regular review, accreditation, and alignment of framework concepts and themes with a National eHealth Strategy Interoperability Development Process. To demonstrate the framework's applicability, a proposed architecture for the Kgonafalo mobile telemedicine programme is presented. CONCLUSION Interoperable mHealth solutions and eRecords systems have the potential to strengthen health systems. This paper reports the design and development of an evidence-based mHeRIF to align with, build upon, and expand National eHealth Strategies by guiding the linking of mHealth solutions to eRecord systems in Botswana and other developing countries facing similar circumstances.","Ndlovu, Kagiso; Mars, Maurice; Scott, Richard E",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07134-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34654432/,136
162277,Whatsapp platform as a teledentistry tool in oral and maxillofacial pathologies in Senegal,2021,"The Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter-2 inhibitor, empagliflozin (EMPA), reduces mortality and hospitalisation for heart failure following myocardial infarction irrespective of diabetes status. While the findings suggest an inherent cardioprotective capacity, the mechanism remains unknown. We studied infarct size (IS) ex-vivo in isolated hearts exposed to global IR injury and in-vivo in rats subjected to regional myocardial ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury, in whom we followed left ventricular dysfunction for 28 days. We compared rats that were given EMPA orally for 7 days before, EMPA 1.5 h before IR injury and at onset of reperfusion and continued orally during the follow-up period. We used echocardiography, high resolution respirometry, microdialysis and plasma levels of β-hydroxybutyrate to assess myocardial performance, mitochondrial respiration and intermediary metabolism, respectively. Pretreatment with EMPA for 7 days reduced IS in-vivo (65 ± 7% vs. 46 ± 8%, p < 0.0001 while administration 1.5 h before IR, at onset of reperfusion or ex-vivo did not. EMPA alleviated LV dysfunction irrespective of the reduction in IS. EMPA improved mitochondrial respiration and modulated myocardial interstitial metabolism while the concentration of β-hydroxybutyric acid was only transiently increased without any association with IS reduction. EMPA reduces infarct size and yields cardioprotection in non-diabetic rats with ischemic LV dysfunction by an indirect, delayed intrinsic mechanism that also improves systolic function beyond infarct size reduction. The mechanism involves enhanced mitochondrial respiratory capacity and modulated myocardial metabolism but not hyperketonemia.","Seefeldt, Jacob Marthinsen; Lassen, Thomas Ravn; Hjortbak, Marie Vognstoft; Jespersen, Nichlas Riise; Kvist, Frederikke; Hansen, Jakob; Bøtker, Hans Erik",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-89149-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33953281/,136
163222,Family physicians supporting patients with palliative care needs within the Patient Medical Home in the community: An Appreciative Inquiry qualitative study,2021-01-06,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic forced a shift in conducting clinical research. Ensuring the safety of all stakeholders (patients, research personnel, family members), maintaining financial viability, and overcoming operational restrictions (limited access to sites, workforce restrictions, reduced data collection) are barriers to continuing clnical research. GOG Partners, the GOG Foundation industry-sponsored clinical trials group, has been proactive to implement the following: 1) immediate compliance with CDC, FDA, and NIH guidelines with regard to clinical trial management;2) systems that allowed for remote monitoring and other remote activities (telemedicine patient visits, remote data collection, shipping of drug to patients, virtual study start-up);3) enhance enrollment opportunites away from university-based sites towards community-based practices;4) increased frequency of our operations meetings with industry. The objective of this report is to describe how the pandemic affected accrual to GOG Partners' trials. Accrual data for GOG Partners trials over the past 4 years (2017- July 2020) were collected. 'Pandemic' months were considered March thru July 2020. Information collected included accrual numbers, institution type (university versus non-university), and region of country. Descriptive statistics were analyzed. Over the past 4 years, the median monthly accrual to GOG Partners trials was 43 patients (range: 14-95). Between March and July 2020, the median accrual was 59 patients (range: 43-72). For the same 5-month period over the past 3 years (March to July 2017, 2018, 2019) the median accrual was 36 (14-95). Accrual in March 2020 was 69 patients. Accrual decreased to 43 patients in April 2020 and 47 patients in May 2020 with respective z-scores of -0.25 and -0.01. June and July 2020 showed increased accrual with 59 and 72 patients respectively. The median number of participating sites per month over the past 4 years was 32 (9-66). There was an immediate decline in the number of sites participating from April to May 2020 of 36%. The number of sites participating in June and July were 38 and 52, respectively. During the pandemic, the accrual in the New England, Mid-Atlantic, Pacific and South Atlantic regions varied from their baselines. These variations followed the trends in COVID-19 spread. Non-university institutions accrued at a near-average rate throughout the months of April and May. During that same period, universities observed a decline in accrual of 48%. Accrual to GOG Partners' trials increased 37% over the median monthly accrual since the pandemic began. During the pandemic, total monthly accrual fell below or reached the median during only 1 month. Regional diversity of sites participating in GOG Partners' studies helped in preventing a more dramatic drop in participation. While overall accrual has historically shown to be relatively balanced between institution types, non-university institutions were less negatively impacted.

163807,COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Anxiety and Depression Symptoms among Adults with Type 1 Diabetes,2021,"The insurance industry is built on risk classification, grouping insureds into homogeneous classes. Through actions such as underwriting, pricing, and so forth, it differentiates, or discriminates, among insureds. Actuaries have responsibility for pricing insurance risk transfers and are intimately involved in other aspects of company actions and so have a keen interest in whether or not discrimination is appropriate from both company and societal viewpoints. This article reviews social and economic principles that can be used to assess the appropriateness of insurance discrimination. Discrimination issues vary by the line of insurance business and by the country and legal jurisdiction. This article examines social and economic principles from the vantage of a specific line of business and jurisdiction;these vantage points provide insights into principles. To sharpen understanding of the social and economic principles, this article also describes discrimination considerations for prohibitions based on diagnosis of COVID-19, the pandemic that swept the globe in 2020. Insurance discrimination issues have been an important topic for the insurance industry for decades and are evolving in part due to insurers’ extensive use of Big Data;that is, the increasing capacity and computational abilities of computers, availability of new and innovative sources of data, and advanced algorithms that can detect patterns in insurance activities that were previously unknown. On the one hand, the fundamental issues of insurance discrimination have not changed with Big Data;one can think of credit-based insurance scoring and price optimization as simply forerunners of this movement. On the other hand, issues regarding privacy and use of algorithmic proxies take on increased importance as insurers’ extensive use of data and computational abilities evolve. © 2021 The Author(s).

The aim of this paper is to tease out some implications for re-orienting the African tourism research agenda from 2020 and beyond. Arguably, an appropriate African research response to COVID-19 in the context of tourism must embrace a genuine transdisciplinary approach and draw in researchers who would not, historically, have operated in the tourism space. Seven key themes are discussed namely, market confidence;dependence on international long-haul tourists;supporting regional and domestic tourism especially VFR travel;redefining community-based tourism;informal sector resilience;climate change;and, addressing present-mindedness in African tourism scholarship.","Rogerson, C.

We developed T-cell COVID-19 Atlas (T-CoV, https://t-cov.hse.ru) – the comprehensive web portal, which allows one to analyze how SARS-CoV-2 mutations alter the presentation of viral peptides by HLA molecules. The data are presented for common virus variants and the most frequent HLA class I and class II alleles. Binding affinities of HLA molecules and viral peptides were assessed with accurate in silico methods. The obtained results highlight the importance of taking HLA alleles diversity into account: mutation-mediated alterations in HLA-peptide interactions were highly dependent on HLA alleles. For example, we found that the essential number of peptides tightly bound to HLA-B*07:02 in the reference Wuhan variant ceased to be tight binders for the Indian (Delta) and the UK (Alpha) variants. In summary, we believe that T-CoV will help researchers and clinicians to predict the susceptibility of individuals with different HLA genotypes to infection with variants of SARS-CoV-2 and/or forecast its severity.","Nersisyan, Stepan; Zhiyanov, Anton; Shkurnikov, Maxim; Tonevitsky, Alexander",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.06.451227,136

Fear, avoidance of or lack of time for essential conversations, physical separation during final moments, and lack of rituals for these contingencies leave individuals alone with loss, mourning, and grieving. How is leisure relevant during such realities? Historically, leisure has been present across diverse cultural dying and death practices: art, music, dance, theater, play, contemplation, rituals, and somatic practices. These connect individuals with life forces even as some are absent in the flesh. In truth, we are all experiencing dying-death-mourning-beginning again during the COVID-19 pandemic. Josef Pieper's (2017, 2016, 2011, 1999, 1988) philosophy hints of leisure as context for the meaning, purpose, and comfort in such trying times: contemplating one's place in a changing world/universe and celebrating or affirming that relationship in community.","Fox, K.

ADP-ribosylation is a common post-translational modification of proteins; also nucleic acids and small molecules can be modified by the covalent attachment of ADP-ribose. This modification, important in cellular signalling and infection processes, is usually executed by enzymes from the large superfamily of ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) Here, using bioinformatics approaches, we identify a novel putative ADP-ribosyltransferase family, conserved in eukaryotic evolution, with a divergent active site. The hallmark of these proteins is the ART domain nestled between flanking leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. LRRs are involved in innate immune surveillance. The novel family appears as likely novel ADP-ribosylation “writers”, previously unnoticed new players in cell signaling by this emerging post-translational modification. We propose that this family, including its human member LRRC9, may be involved in an ancient defense mechanism, with analogies to the innate immune system, and coupling pathogen detection to ADP-ribosyltransfer signalling.","Wyżewski, Zbigniew; Gradowski, Marcin; Krysińska, Marianna; Dudkiewicz, Małgorzata; Pawłowski, Krzysztof",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.21.169896,136

NSC's primary goal is to serve the nnderserved families in that area with children aged 15 months to 10 years who have ASD symptoms free of cost. Our proposed and implemented Electronic Medical Records (NSC: EMR) has been developed for NSC. This paper describes the NSC: EMR's design specification and whole development process with the workflow control of this system in NSC. This NSC: EMR has been used to record the patient's medical data and make appointments both physically or virtually. The integration of standardized psychological evaluation form has reduced the paperwork and physical storage burden for the family navigator. By deploying the system, the family navigator can increase their productivity from the screening to all intervention processes to deal with ASD children. Even in the lockdown time, due to the pandemic of COVID-19, about 84 ASD patients from the deprived family at that area got registered and took intervention through this NSC: EMR.

In this context, teaching through online studios has become a necessity. This study aimed to identify students’ practical experiences in fully online interior design studios and determine whether these experiences differ according to students’ educational levels to help improve and ensure the quality of online design education. The participants were 69 female interior design students. A questionnaire was applied using five axes, namely virtual learning environment, curriculum and illustration tools, students’ experiences, interaction with the teacher, and overall satisfaction and hopes. The results showed that the newer students had a positive experience with the online design studio, while there were statistically significant differences between the answers of students at different levels. It was noticeable that the students’ experience on all axes was different, and the level of satisfaction among the new students in Studio 2 was higher than among the students nearing graduation in Studio 6. The findings of this study will benefit the academic programme and technology developers in creating a suitable online learning environment for each profession.

181729,Volunteer emergency responder response to the COVID-19 pandemic surge,2021,"Two mRNA vaccines, Pfizer-BNT162b2 and Moderna-mRNA-1273, were granted the US Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization for preventing COVID-19. However, little is known about the difference in antibody responses induced by the two mRNA vaccines in naive and individuals with a previous history of infections (PI group). Therefore, we investigated the levels of anti-S-RBD total antibodies (IgM, IgA, and IgG), anti-S-RBD IgG, and anti-S-RBD IgA in these two groups 1-13 (median=6) weeks following administration of two doses of mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 vaccines. Results showed that in naive-vaccinated group, the mRNA-1327 vaccine induces significantly higher levels of S-RBD total antibodies (3.5-fold; p<0.001), S-RBD IgG (2-fold-p<0.01), and S-IgA (2.1-fold, p<0.001) than the BNT162b2 vaccine. In the PI-vaccinated group, both vaccines produce significantly higher S-RBD total antibodies level than those of the naive-vaccinated group. The PI group produced a higher level of S-RBD IgG than the naive-BNT162b2 (p=0.05) but not more than the naive-mRNA-1273 (p=0.9) group. Interestingly, the PI-vaccinated group produced a comparable level of IgA ratio to the naive-mRNA-1273 group but significantly higher than the naive-BNT162b2 group (1.6-fold, p<0.001). Our results showed that the mRNA-1327 vaccine is more immunogenic and induces a greater antibody response than the BNT162b2 vaccine.","Al-Sadeq, D.; Shurrab, F.; Ismail, A.; Amanullah, F.

193252,"Preparing for disasters: what should you know, and when should you know it?",2005,"Viral encephalitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet there is no proven efficacious therapy for most viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS). Many of the viruses that cause encephalitis induce apoptosis and activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) following infection. We have previously shown that reovirus infection of epithelial cell lines activates JNK-dependent apoptosis. We now show that reovirus infection resulted in activation of JNK and caspase-3 in the CNS. Treatment of reovirus-infected mice with a cell-permeating peptide that competitively inhibits JNK activity resulted in significantly prolonged survival of intracerebrally infected mice following an otherwise lethal challenge with T3D (100 x 50% lethal dose). Protection correlated with reduced CNS injury, reduced neuronal apoptosis, and reduced c-Jun activation without altering the viral titer or viral antigen distribution. Given the efficacy of the inhibitor in protecting mice from viral encephalitis, JNK inhibition represents a promising and novel treatment strategy for viral encephalitis.","Beckham, J David; Goody, Robin J; Clarke, Penny; Bonny, Christophe; Tyler, Kenneth L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17475657/,136

Occupationally acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection could also result in life-threatening, opportunistic lung infections as a result of host immunosuppression. These three occupationally acquired infections are major public health problems that carry with them enormous economic and societal implications. The present review discusses their microbiology, epidemiology and mode of transmission, clinical features, treatment and, more importantly, prevention. Health care workers (HCWs), who are a valuable health care resource especially in the developing nations, are at high risk for acquiring these diseases. Drugs for the treatment of HIV infection are expensive and not widely available in the developing world where they are most needed. As there is no well-recognised effective treatment for SARS and avian influenza, prevention of infection is most important. HCWs should be aware of occupationally acquired infections and know how to protect themselves. Regular training should be provided by all health care institutions on infection control measures and the use of personal protective equipment.","Ho, P L; Becker, M; Chan-Yeung, M M",The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17609045/,136

Earlier report highlighted the possibility of cerebral ""hyperoxygenation"" secondary to inhalational induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane in small number of children. OBJECTIVE The aim of this retrospective review was whether similar cerebral ""hyperoxygenation"" trends can be seen in larger and retrospective patients' database. METHODS Data of patients who had undergone cardiac surgeries at Children's Hospital during the two-year period (2010-2011) was retrieved during this retrospective review: (a) stored computer data from INVOS Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter for oximetry numbers and total duration of oximetry monitoring, (b) paper chart perfusion records of the cardiac surgeries for age and sex of the patient, urgency of the surgery, type of induction (inhalational or intravenous), and total duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, (c) general medical records for inpatient setting vs. outpatient setting of the patient, and (d) anesthesia medical records for name of the medications used during induction of anesthesia to segregate the patients who had fentanyl as a lone induction agent and sevoflurane as a lone induction agent, for final statistical calculations and analysis. For the two-year period (2010-2011), data of 358 patients who had cardiac surgeries at Children's Hospital were reviewed. However, after deletions of various patients' data due to various reasons, only 69 patients (0-4 years of age) who had sevoflurane induction were analyzed for final statistical comparisons to 14 patients (0-4 years of age) who had fentanyl induction. RESULTS Cerebral and renal ""hyperoxygenation"" occurred during the first 127 minutes with sevoflurane as compared to fentanyl though the percentage changes from pre-induction values in oximetry during this time did not reach level of significance. However, only cerebral ""hyperoxygenation"" persisted in the last 127 minutes when patients had been induced with sevoflurane as compared to fentanyl. CONCLUSION Cerebral ""hyperoxygenation"" occurs with inhalational induction of anesthesia with vasoparalytic sevoflurane in children 0 to 4 years of age when compared to anesthesia induction with vasoneutral fentanyl.","Gupta, Deepak; Bzeih, Rami; Zestos, Maria Markakis",Middle East journal of anaesthesiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25137862/,136

Intraoperative visual evoked potential (VEP) monitoring has been reported to have little usefulness in predicting postoperative visual outcome. To re-evaluate its usefulness, we adapted a high-power light-stimulating device with electroretinography (ERG) to ascertain retinal light stimulation. Intraoperative VEP monitoring was conducted in TSSs in 33 consecutive patients with sellar and parasellar tumors under total venous anesthesia. The detectability rates of N75, P100, and N135 were 94.0%, 85.0%, and 79.0%, respectively. The mean latencies and amplitudes of N75, P100, and N135 were 76.8 ± 6.4 msec and 4.6 ± 1.8 μV, 98.0 ± 8.6 msec and 5.0 ± 3.4 μV, and 122.1 ± 16.3 msec and 5.7 ± 2.8 μV, respectively. The amplitude was defined as the voltage difference from N75 to P100 or P100 to N135. The criterion for amplitude changes was defined as a > 50% increase or 50% decrease in amplitude compared to the control level. The surgeon was immediately alerted when the VEP changed beyond these thresholds, and the surgical manipulations were stopped until the VEP recovered. Among the 28 cases with evaluable VEP recordings, the VEP amplitudes were stable in 23 cases and transiently decreased in 4 cases. In these 4 cases, no postoperative vision deterioration was observed. One patient, whose VEP amplitude decreased without subsequent recovery, developed vision deterioration. Intraoperative VEP monitoring with ERG to ascertain retinal light stimulation by the new stimulus device was reliable and feasible in preserving visual function in patients undergoing TSS.","Kamio, Yoshinobu; Sakai, Naoto; Sameshima, Tetsuro; Takahashi, Goro; Koizumi, Shinichiro; Sugiyama, Kenji; Namba, Hiroki",Neurologia medico-chirurgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25070017/,136

200575,Listening to Latinx Patient Perspectives on COVID-19 to Inform Future Prevention Efforts,2021,"Several cellular proteins, including several heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), have been shown to function as regulatory factors for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) RNA synthesis as a result of their binding to the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of the viral RNA. Here, we identified another cellular protein, p70, which has been shown by UV cross-linking to bind both the positive- and negative-strand UTRs of MHV RNA specifically. We purified p70 with a a one-step RNA affinity purification procedure with the biotin-labeled 5'-UTR. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-mass spectrometry identified it as synaptotagmin-binding cytoplasmic RNA-interacting protein (SYNCRIP). SYNCRIP is a member of the hnRNP family and localizes largely in the cytoplasm. The p70 was cross-linked to the MHV positive- or negative-strand UTR in vitro and in vivo. The bacterially expressed SYNCRIP was also able to bind to the 5'-UTR of both strands. The SYNCRIP-binding site was mapped to the leader sequence of the 5'-UTR, requiring the UCUAA repeat sequence. To investigate the functional significance of SYNCRIP in MHV replication, we expressed a full-length or a C-terminally truncated form of SYNCRIP in mammalian cells expressing the MHV receptor. The overexpression of either form of SYNCRIP inhibited syncytium formation induced by MHV infection. Furthermore, downregulation of the endogenous SYNCRIP with a specific short interfering RNA delayed MHV RNA synthesis; in contrast, overexpression or downregulation of SYNCRIP did not affect MHV translation. These results suggest that SYNCRIP may be directly involved in MHV RNA replication as a positive regulator. This study identified an additional cellular hnRNP as an MHV RNA-binding protein potentially involved in viral RNA synthesis.","Choi, Keum S; Mizutani, Akihiro; Lai, Michael M C",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15542667/,136

METHODS A prospective survey design was used. Surveys were sent to all delegates (n=432) who attended the conference, and 294 delegates responded (68% response rate). The survey was developed to determine the level of concern about travelling to Toronto; the adequacy of screening measures; the level of stress about attending; and the occupational consequences of attending. RESULTS Fifty per cent of the participants were not concerned about travelling to Toronto, while the other 50% expressed some concern ranging from mild to serious. Concerns included being exposed to SARS and fear of transmitting it to others upon return. Reasons for attending the conference despite concern included a desire for continuing education, decrease in the number of reported SARS cases, and perceived minimal risk. Almost one-half (n=140) felt the screening measures at the conference were adequate, while 4% felt they were inadequate and 9% somewhat adequate. Delegates (n=99) suggested that temperature-taking (32.2%), improved screening vigilance (14.4%), SARS screening forms checked daily (9.1%), strictly controlled entry (8.1%) and adopting hospital screening procedures (7.1%) should have been instituted. CONCLUSION Health care professionals planning conferences in this era of new respiratory diseases can benefit from understanding the responses of delegates who attended conferences during outbreaks. Clear communication about the potential risks and benefits, as well as instituting full screening precautions, will help to allay concerns.","Stinson, Jennifer; McCartney, Colin J L; Leung, Andrea; Katz, Joel",Pain research & management,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15340584/,136

201289,Fighting COVID-19: Enabling Graduating Students to Start Internship Early at Their Own Medical School,2020,"AIMS Stapled transanal mucosectomy is widely used by a lot of surgeon and in RCT, when compared to other haemorrhoidectomy techniques, it didn't show a real primacy. We describe results obtained with a new device, the EEA™ 33-mm Hemorrhoid and Prolapse Stapler Set con DST Series™ (Covidien™), used on 65 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS Sixty-five patients underwent a stapled transanal mucosectomy for grade III (n° 20), IV (n° 15) haemorrhois and rectal prolapse (n° 30). The operation were performed by two surgeons. Results. Resected tissue had a mean width of 4.2 cm (3.3-6.1 cm) and a mean weight of 11 g (8-21 g). Surgical time were 22 min (15-35 min). Bleeding of the suture line were observed in 5 cases (7.7%) and they required a mean of 2 haemostatic stitch (1-5) in adsorbable suture 2/0. Mucoprolapsectomy was considered excellent in 55 patients (84.7%), good in 8 patients (12.3%), bad in 2 patients (3%) by surgeons. There were no early and late complications like bleeding, abscesses, anastomotic dehiscence. We report two case of perianal haematoma that don't need any treatment and one case of anal stenosis treated with dilatation therapy. Post-operative pain, estimated with VAS, emphasized an excellent response to NSAIDs in first postoperative day, in 10 cases (15.4%) we prolonged analgesic therapy for 3 days, in one case (1.5%) for one week. After 6 month all patients were revaluated with physical examination and anoscopy. Only one patient (1.5%) had an asymptomatic recurrence of rectal prolapse. CONCLUSION We conclude that the new device makes easy and standardized surgery. The new device reduce a lot of difficult in patients with tight pelvis and a small distance between ischiatic tubers.","Gaj, F; Andreuccetti, J; Sportelli, G; Bottari, S",La Clinica terapeutica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22555834/,136
203513,Consumer Views on Using Digital Data for COVID-19 Control in the United States,2021,"PURPOSE: Pandemics can be associated with anxiety and depression in cancer patients who are undergoing treatment. In the present study, we aimed to perform a comparative evaluation of the conditions of cancer patients before and during the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) to detect the impact of the pandemic on treatment delays that are associated with anxiety and depression in cancer patients. In addition, the effect of public transport use on treatment delays was examined. METHODS: BDI and BAI were administered to 595 breast, ovarian, colon and gastric cancer patients before and during the pandemic. The questionnaires were administered by the physician blindly, who was unaware of the delay of the patients. The number of days by which the patients delayed their treatment due to the fear of contamination were recorded retrospectively. Correlation analyses were performed between the obtained scores and treatment delays. RESULTS: The depression and anxiety levels in cancer patients were found to increase during the pandemic (p = 0.000), and this increase was positively correlated with the disruption of their treatment (p = 0.000, r = 0.81). Depression and anxiety levels and treatment delays were higher in elderly patients (p = 0.021). Depression and anxiety were more pronounced in female patients (p = 0.000). Moreover, treatment delays were more common in patients who had to use public transportation (p = 0.038). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may increase anxiety and depression in cancer patients. This can cause patients to experience treatment delays due to concerns about becoming infected. At this point, if necessary, assistance should be obtained from psychiatric and public health experts.","Yildirim, Ozgen Ahmet; Poyraz, Kerem; Erdur, Erkan",Qual. life res,,136

207124,COVID-19 Pandemic and Virtual Clinics for Diabetes Care,2021,"The anemia of MDS often results in decreased quality of life, which is invoked to justify red cell transfusions; however, there are sparse data regarding the minimum hemoglobin (Hb) at which it is safe to forgo transfusions for patients with no evidence of end-organ damage. This issue is even more important in the COVID-19 era, where decreases in blood donations have stressed the blood supply. In March 2018, using a modified Delphi method, we convened a panel of 13 expert MDS clinicians for three iterative rounds to discuss a minimum safe Hb for this population. While the panel was unable to reach the pre-set consensus of 75% for a specific Hb threshold, there was 100% consensus that it be no greater than 7.5 g/dL. Our data suggest that, given no end-organ effects of anemia, patients with MDS can safely forgo transfusions with a Hb of 7.5 g/dL or higher.","Tanasijevic, Anna M; Revette, Anna; Klepin, Heidi D; Zeidan, Amer; Townsley, Danielle; DiNardo, Courtney D; Sebert, Marie; DeZern, Amy E; Stone, Richard M; Magnavita, Emily S; Chen, Richard; Sekeres, Mikkael A; Abel, Gregory A",Leuk Lymphoma,,136

As we return to ""normality"" we reflect on lessons learnt from our response to this pandemic. A service evaluation was performed from patient notes between March 23rd and May 8th 2020 and an anonymous survey given to patients attending outpatient appointments. 258 patients were referred to our burns service and 148 patients completed the survey. Eleven burns were caused by treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Patients delayed seeking medical attention due to concern of catching COVID-19 (36% adults, 8% children). There was a delay in referral of 17 patients despite them fulfilling the referral criteria. Infection rates were higher following delayed presentation (21% vs 6%). The majority of burns were managed conservatively (237/258). Dressing changes were performed at home by 32% of patients. The outreach team treated 22 patients. During the pandemic telemedicine has improved the efficiency of outpatient burn care and outreach nurses have enabled treatment of vulnerable patients. More must be done to raise public awareness of preventable causes of burn injury and to reassure them to seek help when burns occur.","Phillips, Georgina S A; Talwar, Cyrus; Makaranka, Stanislau; Collins, Declan P",Burns,,136

Fear of contamination can both increase levels of stress in healthy individuals and intensify psychiatric symptoms in patients with pre-existing conditions, especially obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the imminent risk of contamination creates a logical need for self-surveillance and hygiene habits. However, this kind of information can have drastic implications for subjects with OCD, since cognitive distortions and compensatory strategies (cleansing rituals) are no longer irrational or oversized - rather, these ideas become legitimate and socially accepted, generating plausible validation for the intensification of compulsive cleaning rituals. Patients who presented remission of OCD symptoms would be more likely to have a relapse, and subclinical patients may scale up and ultimately be diagnosed with OCD due to the reinforcement of their habits, emotions and thoughts.","Ornell, Felipe; Braga, Daniela Tusi; Bavaresco, Daniela Vicente; Francke, Ingrid Davila; Scherer, Juliana Nichterwitz; von Diemen, Lisia; Kessler, Felix Henrique Paim",Trends psychiatry psychother.

Delta variants (B.1.617.2, AY.2, and AY.3) are now the focus of international concern because they are causing widespread COVID-19 disease globally. Vaccine breakthrough cases caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants also are of considerable public health and medical concern worldwide. As part of a comprehensive project, we sequenced the genomes of 3,913 SARS-CoV-2 from patient samples acquired March 15, 2021 through July 3, 2021 in the Houston Methodist hospital system and studied vaccine breakthrough cases. During the study period Delta variants increased to cause 58% of all COVID-19 cases and spread throughout the metropolitan Houston area. In addition, Delta variants caused a significantly higher rate of vaccine breakthrough cases (19.7% compared to 5.8% for all other variants). Importantly, only 6.5% of all COVID-19 cases occurred in fully immunized individuals, and relatively few of these patients required hospitalization. Our genomic and epidemiologic data emphasize that vaccines used in the United States are highly effective in decreasing severe COVID-19 disease, hospitalizations, and deaths.","Musser, James M.; Christensen, Paul A.; Olsen, Randall J.; Long, Scott Wesley; Subedi, Sishir; Davis, James J.; Hodjat, Parsa; Walley, Debbie R.; Kinskey, Jacob C.; Gollihar, Jimmy D.",,,136

We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. METHODS: All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. FINDINGS: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0-58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0-13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF&#945;. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

Here, the construction of a noninfectious SARS-CoV-2 reporter replicon and its application in deciphering viral replication mechanisms and evaluating SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors are presented. The replicon genome is replication competent but does not produce progeny virions. Its replication can be inhibited by RdRp mutations or by known SARS-CoV-2 antiviral compounds. Using this system, a high-throughput antiviral assay has also been developed. Significant differences in potencies of several SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors in different cell lines were observed, which highlight the challenges of discovering antivirals capable of inhibiting viral replication in vivo and the importance of testing compounds in multiple cell culture models.

Zion,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 outcomes and risk factors, including comorbidities and medication regimens, in people living with diabetes (PLWD) are poorly defined for low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: The Provincial Health Data Centre (Western Cape, South Africa) is a health information exchange collating patient-level routine health data for approximately 4 million public sector health care seekers. Data from COVID-19 patients diagnosed between March and July 2020, including PLWD, were analysed to describe risk factors, including dispensed diabetes medications and comorbidities, and their association with COVID-19 outcomes in this population. FINDINGS: There were 64,476 COVID-19 patients diagnosed. Of 9305 PLWD, 44.9% were hospitalised, 4.0% admitted to ICU, 0.6% received ventilation and 15.4% died. In contrast, proportions of COVID-19 patients without diabetes were: 12.2% hospitalised, 1.0% admitted, 0.1% ventilated and 4.6% died. PLWD were significantly more likely to be admitted (OR:3.73, 95 %CI: 3.53, 3.94) and to die (OR:3.01, 95 %CI: 2.76,3.28). Significant hospitalised risk factors included HIV infection, chronic kidney disease, current TB, male sex and increasing age. Significant risk factors for mortality were CKD, male sex, HIV infection, previous TB and increasing age. Pre-infection use of insulin was associated with a significant increased risk for hospitalisation (OR:1·39, 95 %CI:1·24,1·57) and mortality (OR1·49, 95 %CI:1·27; 1·74) and metformin was associated with a reduced risk for hospitalisation (OR:0·62,95 %CI:0·55, 0·71) and mortality (OR 0·77, 95 %CI:0·64; 0·92).

222330,COVID-19-related cancellation of elective orthopaedic surgery caused increased pain and psychosocial distress levels,2021,"PURPOSE: Containing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic would require aggressive contact tracing and isolation of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. Models in published literature have suggested that digital rather than manual contact tracing might be more effective in containing the pandemic. This article seeks to examine the forms of contact tracing that Singapore, a highly dense city-state, adopts with a focus on new innovations including the use of digital technology. METHODS: An exploratory literature search in PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies reviewing technological approaches and responses to COVID-19 was performed. Information published by national agencies was also analysed to ascertain how technology was utilised in contact tracing. RESULTS: Contact tracing in Singapore is overseen by the Ministry of Health (MOH). COVID-19 cases are interviewed on their whereabouts during a backward and forward activity mapping process to identify close contacts. Extensive contact tracing even involving the police and serological tools have helped to establish links between cases and closed several local clusters. Examination of patient's digital footprint has helped in contact tracing. Other digital technology introduced includes SafeEntry and TraceTogether. SafeEntry is a cloud-based visitor registration system while TraceTogether is a mobile phone application which operates by exchanging anonymised identifiers between nearby phones via Bluetooth connection. CONCLUSION: Digital contact tracing is likely to expand and continue to complement human-based contact tracing for the current and future pandemics. However, at this juncture, it is not ready to replace the manual and meticulous work that only Singapore contact tracers can achieve.","Lai, Sean Han Sheng; Tang, Camelia Qian Ying; Kurup, Asok; Thevendran, Gowreeson",Int. orthop,,136

Symptoms of pulmonary infection with M kansasii may include cough, sputum production, weight loss, breathlessness, chest pain, hemoptysis and fever or sweats.The paper presents the case of a 30-year-old woman, confirmed with moderate SARS-COV2 infection at a county hospital and transferred to ""Marius Nasta"" Institute for Pneumology for specialty treatment. At admission, the CT exam reveals multiple ""tree in bud"" lesions and cavity lesions located at the RUL level. Bacteriological examinations for the genus mycobacterium were initially negative, but from the bronchial aspirate, the bacteriological examination was BAAR positive. Genetic testing confirmed mycobacterium infection. Resistance to H, R was not detected. According to the national protocol, antibiotic treatment is initiated with Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethambutol and Pyrazinamide. The patient tolerated the treatment well throughout the hospitalization period, as there were no interactions between the treatment for SARS-COV2 and the antibiotic one. Due to the favorable evolution, the patient is discharged one month after starting treatment. As recommendations, the patient must present herself at the territorial TB clinic, in order to continue the antibiotic treatment for up to 6 months.At two months, the culture shows infection with mycobacterium kansassi, thus the treatment is modified by administering Rifampicin, Etambutol and Azithromycin. Following the administration of the new treatment, the lung lesions show regression. In the case of mycobacterium kansassi infections, the treatment will be continued for up to 12 months. The evolution of M. kansassi infection may be influenced by various factors, but in this case the moderate SARS-COV2 infection, cured in 3 weeks, did not influence the favourable evolution. Also, the absence of shortness of breath, as well as the compliance and absence of treatment resistance were keen factors in the evolution under treatment.In conclusion, the patient was initially admitted to the hospital for a moderate COVID-19 infection. The routine CT exam was also suggestive for a possible other pathology, and follow-up tests and examinations led to the discovery of an infection with M. kansassi. The SARS-COV-2 infection had favourable evolution under treatment and was cured in 3 weeks, but the treatment for M. kansassi is long-term and may have effects on the patients' psychology, as well as by the presence of adverse reactions, not following the treatment can be fatal with death occurring in 50% of cases.","Popescu-Hagen, M.

We evaluated this translation on the basis of psychometric testing in a German convenience sample. A cross-sectional online survey (n = 470) was carried out using a translated version of the health consciousness scale, oriented on the basis of international guidelines. As previous studies have not consistently confirmed the factorial structure of the health consciousness scale, we conducted a Confirmatory Factor Analysis to verify its factorial structure. Furthermore, we cross-validated the questionnaire with other scales in order to verify convergent and discriminant validity. The results indicated a two-factor solution for the Health Consciousness Scale-German (HCS-G). The criterion validity was confirmed on the basis of a significantly positive correlation between the HCS-G and health literacy. Furthermore, strict measurement invariance was able to be verified, indicating that the HCS-G is an applicable measurement, regardless of gender. In practical research, this questionnaire can help to assess health consciousness and its influence on health-related constructs. Future studies should consider possible mediating variables between health consciousness and health outcomes.","Marsall, Matthias; Engelmann, Gerrit; Skoda, Eva-Maria; Teufel, Martin; Bäuerle, Alexander",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,136
235470,Harmful consequences of COVID-19 fear in patients with cancer,2020,"There are outstanding evolutionary questions on the recent emergence of human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 including the role of reservoir species, the role of recombination and its time of divergence from animal viruses. We find that the sarbecoviruses-the viral subgenus containing SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-undergo frequent recombination and exhibit spatially structured genetic diversity on a regional scale in China. SARS-CoV-2 itself is not a recombinant of any sarbecoviruses detected to date, and its receptor-binding motif, important for specificity to human ACE2 receptors, appears to be an ancestral trait shared with bat viruses and not one acquired recently via recombination. To employ phylogenetic dating methods, recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three independent methods. Bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were shown to be consistent for these three approaches and for two different prior specifications of evolutionary rates based on HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV. Divergence dates between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir were estimated as 1948 (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 1879-1999), 1969 (95% HPD: 1930-2000) and 1982 (95% HPD: 1948-2009), indicating that the lineage giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating unnoticed in bats for decades.","Boni, Maciej F; Lemey, Philippe; Jiang, Xiaowei; Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Perry, Blair W; Castoe, Todd A; Rambaut, Andrew; Robertson, David L",Nat. microbiol,,136

In this report we present the performance of the EUROIMMUN enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for semi-quantitative detection of IgA and IgG antibodies in serum and plasma samples using recombinant S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as antigen. Specimens from patients, with and without COVID-19 infection, were tested at the University of Chicago Clinical Microbiology and Immunology Laboratory. Of 86 samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative patients, including 28 samples positive for common human coronavirus strains, 76 tested negative and 10 tested positive for IgA (88.4% agreement, 95% CI: 79.9-93.6) while 84 tested negative and 2 tested positive for IgG (97.7% agreement, 95% CI: 91.9-99.6). Of 82 samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients, 14 tested negative and 68 tested positive for IgA (82.9% agreement, 95% CI: 73.4-89.5) while 27 tested negative and 55 tested positive for IgG (67.1% agreement, 95% CI: 56.3-76.3). Of samples collected &#8805;4 days after positive PCR, 38 of 42 (90.5% agreement, 95% CI: 77.9-96.2) were positive for IgA, and 42 of 42 (100% agreement, 95% CI: 91.6-100) were positive for IgG, respectively. The EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA Assay demonstrated good sensitivity for detection of IgA and excellent sensitivity for detection of IgG antibodies from samples collected &#8805;4 days, after COVID-19 diagnosis by PCR.

238031,Survey on the use of personal protective equipment and COVID-19 testing of pregnant women in Japan,2020,"BACKGROUND: This study investigated the impacts of the first COVID-19 UK lockdown on dog walking and ownership. METHODS: An online survey was circulated via social media (May-June 2020). Completed responses (n = 584) were analysed using within- and between-group comparisons, and multivariable linear and logistic regression models were created. Open-ended data were coded into key themes. RESULTS: During lockdown, dogs were walked less frequently, yet for a similar duration per week and closer to home. Dogs whose owners lived alone, or whose owners or household members had heightened vulnerability to COVID-19 were walked less than before, as were high-energy dogs. A minority of owners continued dog walking despite exhibiting symptoms or needing to self-isolate, justifying lack of help, dog behavioural problems, living in less populated areas, and the importance of outdoor exercise for their mental health. Dog ownership had multiple benefits (companionship, purpose and motivation; break from bad; positive to focus on) as well as challenges (changes in dog behaviour, balancing dog needs with public health guidance, accessing pet food/supplies and services, and sharing crowded outdoor spaces with others). Most did not have an emergency care plan for their pet before the pandemic and only a handful developed one. CONCLUSIONS: Findings can be used to inform public health and dog welfare strategies for future lockdown situations or other disasters and emergencies likely to impact on daily routines.","Owczarczak-Garstecka, Sara C; Graham, Taryn M; Archer, Debra C; Westgarth, Carri",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,136

This highly infectious disease is associated with respiratory failure unusual in other coronavirus infections. Mounting evidence link the accelerated progression of the disease in COVID-19 patients to the hyper-inflammatory state termed as the ""cytokine storm"" involving major systemic perturbations. These include iron dysregulation manifested as hyperferritinemia associated with disease severity. Iron dysregulation induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and promotes oxidative stress. The mitochondria are the hub of cellular oxidative homeostasis. In addition, the mitochondria may circulate ""cell-free"" in non-nucleated platelets, in extracellular vesicles and mitochondrial DNA is found in the extracellular space. The heightened inflammatory/oxidative state may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction leading to platelet damage and apoptosis. The interaction of dysfunctional platelets with coagulation cascades aggravates clotting events and thrombus formation. Furthermore, mitochondrial oxidative stress may contribute to microbiota dysbiosis, altering coagulation pathways and fueling the inflammatory/oxidative response leading to the vicious cycle of events. Here, we discuss various cellular and systemic incidents caused by SARS-CoV-2 that may critically impact intra and extracellular mitochondrial function, and contribute to the progression and severity of the disease. It is crucial to understand how these key modulators impact COVID-19 pathogenesis in the quest to identify novel therapeutic targets that may reduce fatal outcomes of the disease.","Saleh, Jumana; Peyssonnaux, Carole; Singh, Keshav K; Edeas, Marvin",Mitochondrion,,136

To support our colleagues and to assist with diagnosis and treatment, we developed a specialist team. METHODS: The acute respiratory disease support team reviewed 44 consecutive patients referred from the intensive care and coordinated therapies for pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary thrombosis, evolving lung fibrosis and large airway intervention. RESULTS: The mortality for this group was significantly lower (34%) than the total group admitted to critical care as a whole (51%) and for those not reviewed by the team (55%; p=0.012). Pulmonary hypertension was present in 84% of the patients and pulmonary thrombosis in 52%. Thirty-two patients received sildenafil therapy and this was associated with improvement in right heart function in survivors. Ten patients with evolving fibrosis and no evidence of sepsis received high-dose steroid therapy with excellent effect. Five patients developed airway complications requiring intervention. Short time on mechanical ventilation was associated with a poorer outcome (p<0.001). INTERPRETATION: A specialised cardiorespiratory team approach contributes significantly to successful management of severely unwell patients with COVID-19 and offers an important platform for continuity of patient care, education and staff well-being.","Anwar, Asad; Ramos-Bascon, Nordita; Crerar-Gilbert, A Agatha; Barnes, Natalie; Madden, Brendan",Clin Med (Lond),,136

Systems theory was used to examine barriers from individuals who either work closely with or are part of the population. The framework method was used to draw descriptive and explanatory conclusions. Findings suggest limited knowledge for Reproductive Health and IPV Service Providers. Providers often did not feel equipped to discussed PrEP in visits or focused efforts solely on safety.

The coronavirus 2019 pandemic has caused an immediate need for synchronous telemedicine in all specialties, including ophthalmology. While a plethora of mobile VA applications exist, there is no consensus as to what technology can accurately and reproducibly measure a patient's vision at home. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in April 2020 using PubMed, Embase and Medline, identifying English publications from 2010 to 2020 on remote VA tests: 4338 articles were identified and 14 were ultimately included in the review. RESULTS: Of those 14, the highest quality studies, best reproducibility and correlation with in-clinic acuities measured were found using the Peek Acuity application. The studies included patients throughout the world aged 3-97, with and without correction, with known ocular pathology.The Peek Acuity studies measured distance vision on a Samsung Galaxy S3 with a mean difference of 0.055 Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) for home testing compared with the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). Test-retest variability was ±0.029 LogMAR for 95% confidence interval limits. DISCUSSION: There can be one or more lines of variability in vision testing in a clinical setting using reference standard ETDRS and clinical standard Snellen charts. Test-retest reliability is not perfect even on standard clinical charts (variation up to 0.48 LogMAR). Of the technologies reviewed, Peek Acuity home testing had the greatest correlation with ETDRS clinical vision and high test-retest reliability. Peek Acuity performed no worse than Snellen and ETDRS charts.","Samanta, Anindya; Mauntana, Shielah; Barsi, Zahra; Yarlagadda, Bina; Nelson, Patricia C",J Telemed Telecare,,136

In this direction, one of appropriate alternative approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low level (fmol) is exploring plasmonic metasensor technology for COVID-19 diagnostics, which offers exquisite opportunities in advanced healthcare programs, and modern clinical diagnostics. The intrinsic merits of plasmonic metasensors stem from their capability to squeeze electromagnetic fields, simultaneously in frequency, time, and space. However, the detection of low-molecular weight biomolecules at low densities is a typical drawback of conventional metasensors that has recently been addressed using toroidal metasurface technology. This research reports fabrication of a miniaturized plasmonic immunosensor based on toroidal electrodynamics concept that can sustain robustly confined plasmonic modes with ultranarrow lineshapes in the terahertz (THz) frequencies. By exciting toroidal dipole mode using our quasi-infinite metasurface and a judiciously optimized protocol based on functionalized gold nanoparticles (NPs) conjugated with the specific monoclonal antibody of SARS-CoV-2 onto the metasurface, the resonance shifts for diverse concentrations of the spike protein is monitored.

METHODS: A retrospective study based on propensity score matching (PSM) was designed. Primary outcomes included severity rate and mortality. Secondary outcomes included the duration of fever, virus clearance time, length of hospital stays, and use of antibiotics. RESULTS: 639 non-severe patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. 45 patients received IVIg therapy and 594 received non-IVIg therapy. After PSM (1:2 ration), the baseline characteristics were well balanced between IVIg (n = 45) and control group (n = 90). No statistically significant differences were found between IVIg group and control group in the duration of fever (median, 3 vs 3 days, p = 0.667), virus clearance time (median, 11 vs 10 days, p = 0.288), length of hospital stay (median, 14 vs 13 days, p = 0.469), and the use of antibiotics (40% vs 38.9%, p = 0.901). Meanwhile, compared to IVIg group, no more patients progressed to severe cases (3.3% vs 6.6%, p = 0.376) and died (0 vs 2.2%, p = 0.156) in control group.

248079,To keep a COVID-19-free hospital ward: mission possible?,2020,"The U-Net architecture, built upon the fully convolutional network, has proven to be effective in biomedical image segmentation. However, U-Net applies skip connections to merge semantically different low- and high-level convolutional features, resulting in not only blurred feature maps, but also over- and under-segmented target regions. To address these limitations, we propose a simple, yet effective end-to-end depthwise encoder-decoder fully convolutional network architecture, called Sharp U-Net, for binary and multi-class biomedical image segmentation. The key rationale of Sharp U-Net is that instead of applying a plain skip connection, a depthwise convolution of the encoder feature map with a sharpening kernel filter is employed prior to merging the encoder and decoder features, thereby producing a sharpened intermediate feature map of the same size as the encoder map. Using this sharpening filter layer, we are able to not only fuse semantically less dissimilar features, but also to smooth out artifacts throughout the network layers during the early stages of training. Our extensive experiments on six datasets show that the proposed Sharp U-Net model consistently outperforms or matches the recent state-of-the-art baselines in both binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, while adding no extra learnable parameters. Furthermore, Sharp U-Net outperforms baselines that have more than three times the number of learnable parameters.","Zunair, Hasib; Hamza, A. Ben",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12461v1.pdf,136

Platelet count (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-dimer (D-D), and fibrinogen (FIB) were collected and analyzed. The statistical results were expressed as the effect measured by mean difference (MD) with the related 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The PLT level of severe cases was lower than that of mild cases, while the levels of PT, D-D, and FIB were higher than those of mild cases (P < 0.05). The level of APTT had no statistical difference between two groups (P > 0.05). PT of ICU patients was significantly longer (P < 0.05) than that of non-ICU patients. In non-survivors, PT and D-D were higher, yet PLT was lower than that of survivors (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in APTT between survivors and non-survivors (P > 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the notion that coagulopathy could be considered as a risk factor for disease severity and mortality of COVID-19, which may help clinicians to identify the incidence of poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Aining; Leng, Yan; Zhang, Yi; Wu, Kefan; Ji, Yelong; Lei, Shaoqing; Xia, Zhongyuan",Int J Infect Dis,,136
250082,Evaluating the Impact of New York's Executive Order on Face Mask Use on COVID-19 Cases and Mortality: a Comparative Interrupted Times Series Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Skin cancer represents the most common malignancy worldwide and it is imperative that we develop strategies to ensure safe and sustained delivery of cancer care which are resilient to the ongoing impact of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study prospectively evaluates the COVID-19 related patient risk and skin cancer management at a single tertiary referral centre, which rapidly implemented national COVID-19 safety guidelines. METHOD: A prospective cohort study was performed in all patients who underwent surgery for elective skin cancer service management, during the UK COVID-19 pandemic peak (April-May 2020). 'Real-time' 30-day hospital database deceased data were collected. Random selection was undertaken for patients who either underwent operative (surgery group) management or remained on the waiting list (control group); these groups were also prospectively followed-up within a controlled cohort study design and telephoned at the end of June 2020 for the control group or 30 days post-operatively. RESULTS: Of the 767 patients who had operations, there were no COVID-19 related deaths. Both the surgery (n = 384) and control (n = 100) groups were matched for age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, presence of comorbidities, smoking and positive COVID-19 contact. There were no differences in post-operative versus any symptom development (1.3%, 5/384 vs. 4%, 4/100, p = 0.093), or proportion of positive tests (8.6%, 33/384 vs. 8%, 8/100; p = 0.849), between the surgery and control groups. CONCLUSION: These data support continued and safe service provision, and no increased risk to skin cancer patients who require surgical management, which is vital for continuation of cancer treatment in the context of a pandemic.

To this end, the analysis of genomics data plays a vital role in introducing a stronger target and consequently provides better results in laboratory examinations. The modified comparative genomics approach helps us to find novel specific targets by comparing two or more sequences on the nucleotide collection database. We, for the first time, detected ORF8 gene as a potential target for the detection of the novel coronavirus. Unlike previous reported genes (RdRP, E and N genes), ORF8 is entirely specific to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and has no cross-reactivity with other kinds of coronavirus. Accordingly, ORF8 gene can be used as an additional confirmatory assay.","Kakhki, Reza Kamali; Kakhki, Mohammad Kamali; Neshani, Alireza",Gene Rep.,,136

We determined the rate of re-infection, associated factors and mortality during follow up in a cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We analyzed 9,119 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who received serial tests in total of 62 healthcare facilities in United States between December 1, 2019 to November 13, 2020. Re-infection was defined by two positive tests separated by interval of greater than 90 days two after resolution of first infection was confirmed by two or more consecutive negative tests. We performed logistic regression analysis to identify demographic and clinical characteristics associated with re-infection. RESULTS: Re-infection was identified in 0.7% (n=63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5%-0.9%) during follow up of 9,119 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mean period (±standard deviation [SD]) between two positive tests was 116 ± 21 days. A logistic regression analysis identified that asthma (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.2) and nicotine dependence/tobacco use (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.6-4.5) were associated with re-infection. There was a significantly lower rate of pneumonia, heart failure, and acute kidney injury observed with re-infection compared with primary infection among the 63 patients with re-infection There were two deaths (3.2%) associated with re-infection. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a low rate of re-infection confirmed by laboratory tests in a large cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although re-infection appeared to be milder than primary infection, there was associated mortality.","Qureshi, Adnan I; Baskett, William I; Huang, Wei; Lobanova, Iryna; Naqvi, S Hasan; Shyu, Chi-Ren",Clin. infect. dis,,136

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of workers being repeatedly laid off and rehired according to local public health conditions. This may be bad news for market efficiency. Typical employment relations-which resemble non-enforceable (implicit) contracts-rely on reciprocity (Brown et al. in Econometrica 72:747-780, 2004), and hence could be harmed when workers' efforts no longer guarantee reemployment in the next period. In this paper we extend the BFF paradigm to include a per-period probability (0%, 10%, 50%) of publicly observable ""shutdown"", where a specific firm cannot contract with any workers for several periods. A Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium exists in which these shutdowns destabilize relationships, but do not harm efficiency. Our experiment shows that, remarkably, market efficiency can be maintained even with very frequent stochastic shutdowns. However, the dynamic of relational contracts changes from one where a worker finds stable employment to one where she juggles multiple employers, laying the burden of maintaining productivity upon workers and worsening worker-side inequality.

This study examines changes in high-risk alcohol consumption from before to during the COVID-19 crisis in an established cohort of middle-aged British adults. METHODS: Participants consisted of 3,358 middle-aged adults from the 1970 British Cohort Study who completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test for detecting hazardous drinkers in primary care settings in 2016-2018 (when aged 46-48 years) and May 2020 (aged 50 years). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine changes in high-risk drinking (scores of &#8805;5), and multinomial regression was used to compare responses with individual test items in 2016-2018 and May 2020. RESULTS: Among middle-aged British adults, high-risk drinking increased by 5.2 percentage points from 19.4% to 24.6% (p <0.001) between 2016-2018 and May 2020. The increase in high-risk drinking was not moderated by sex, marital status, educational attainment, the presence of a chronic illness, or the year the baseline survey was completed. The prevalence of drinking &#8805;4 times a week doubled from 12.5% to 26% from before to during the pandemic (p<0.001), and there was also evidence of an increase in the frequency of being unable to stop drinking. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence linking the COVID-19 crisis and associated lockdown restrictions to an increase in high-risk drinking patterns and particularly frequent drinking in British adults. Potential long-term changes in drinking habits should be monitored following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Daly, Michael; Robinson, Eric",Am. j. prev. med,,136

A major challenge concerns the specification of the network structure, crucial to consistently estimate the canonical parameters of the generalised logistic curve, e.g. peak time and height. Parameters are estimated under the Bayesian framework, using the {\texttt{ Stan}} probabilistic programming language. The proposed approach is motivated by the analysis of the first and second wave of COVID-19 in Italy, i.e. from February 2020 to July 2020 and from July 2020 to December 2020, respectively. We analyse data at the regional level and, interestingly enough, prove that substantial spatial and temporal dependence occurred in both waves, although strong restrictive measures were implemented during the first wave. Accurate predictions are obtained, improving those of the model where independence across regions is assumed.","Mingione, Marco; Loro, Pierfrancesco Alaimo Di; Farcomeni, Alessio; Divino, Fabio; Lovison, Gianfranco; Lasinio, Giovanna Jona; Maruotti, Antonello",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05067v1.pdf,136

It also provides user accountability in case of disputes. We prove that HERMES meets its security and privacy requirements. Moreover, we demonstrate that HERMES scales for a large number of users and vehicles, making it practical for real-world deployments. To achieve high-performance computations, we evaluate HERMES over two different multiparty computation protocols for Boolean and arithmetic circuits. We provide a detailed comparison of their performance, together with other state-of-the-art access provision protocols. Through a proof-of-concept implementation, our performance analysis demonstrates that HERMES requires only approx 61ms for a single-vehicle access provision.

Understanding the general impact of the pandemic and quarantine measures on homeless populations is essential for keeping the population healthy, but health, medical and social work professionals should also continue to improve their understanding of the importance, and the impact, of social networks and connectivity on homeless and other vulnerable populations. Understanding how the social network disruption caused by quarantine measures influence this and other populations will help us to tailor interventions during and after quarantine to provide the social and emotional supports needed for physical and mental health. Additionally, it is a reminder that the impact of social isolation may have lasting effects on this population, as dealing with the aftermath of these disruptions may take time and intervention for resolution. It can also inform future crises by calling attention to the need for additional supports to be put in place, as well as establishing more diverse social support networks should networks experience disruption.

267779,Prevalence and Predictors of Persistence of COVID-19 Symptoms in Older Adults: A Single-Center Study,2021,"AIM: This study examined the influence of pandemic fatigue on clinical nurses' mental health, sleep quality and job contentment, with resilience as a mediator. BACKGROUND: Pandemic fatigue is an emerging health concern among frontline clinical nurses as a consequence of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the various measures implemented to slow the spread of infection. As yet, no studies have investigated the link between pandemic fatigue and resilience, mental health, sleep quality and job contentment in frontline clinical nurses. METHODS: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study involving 255 frontline clinical nurses in the Philippines. The Pandemic Fatigue Questionnaire, Brief Resilience Scale, Job Contentment Scale and the Sleep Quality Scale were used to collect data through an online survey. RESULTS: The mean pandemic fatigue score was 3.086 (out of 5). Being vaccinated (ß = 0.231, p < .001) and increased staffing levels (ß = -0.488, p < .01) were associated with decreased pandemic fatigue in clinical nurses. Resilience partially mediated the relationships between (a) pandemic fatigue and mental health (ß = -0.488, p < .001), (b) pandemic fatigue and sleep quality (ß = -0.326, p < .001) and (c) pandemic fatigue and job contentment (ß = -0.395, p < .001). CONCLUSION: Clinical nurses who received a COVID-19 vaccine and those who perceived sufficient staffing in their units reported lower levels of pandemic fatigue. Resilience reduces the effects of pandemic fatigue on clinical nurses' mental health, sleep quality and job contentment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: By providing frontline nurses with access to COVID-19 vaccines and ensuring sufficient staffing levels, nurse managers could effectively reduce or prevent pandemic fatigue and improve their mental health. Implementing resilience-promoting measures are essential to support nurses' mental health, promote their sleep quality and foster job satisfaction.","Labrague, Leodoro J",J. nurs. manag,,136

278966,Comorbidity status of deceased COVID-19 in-patients in Italy,2021,"Cellular compartmentalization of proteins and protein complex formation allow cells to tightly control biological processes. Therefore, understanding the subcellular localization and interactions of a specific protein is crucial to uncover its biological function. The advent of proximity labeling (PL) has reshaped cellular proteomics in infection biology. PL utilizes a genetically modified enzyme that generates a ""labeling cloud"" by covalently labeling proteins in close proximity to the enzyme. Fusion of a PL enzyme to a specific antibody or a ""bait"" protein of interest in combination with affinity enrichment mass spectrometry (AE-MS) enables the isolation and identification of the cellular proximity proteome, or proxisome. This powerful methodology has been paramount for the mapping of membrane or membraneless organelles as well as for the understanding of hard-to-purify protein complexes, such as those of transmembrane proteins. Unsurprisingly, more and more infection biology research groups have recognized the potential of PL for the identification of host-pathogen interactions. In this chapter, we introduce the enzymes commonly used for PL labeling as well as recent promising advancements and summarize the major achievements in organelle mapping and nucleic acid PL. Moreover, we comprehensively describe the research on host-pathogen interactions using PL, giving special attention to studies in the field of virology.","Zapatero-Belinchón, Francisco José; Carriquí-Madroñal, Belén; Gerold, Gisa",Adv Virus Res,,136

Roflumilast, a well-known anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory drug, is protective against respiratory models of chemical and smoke induced lung damage. There is significant data which demonstrate the protective effect of PDE-4 inhibitor in respiratory viral models and is likely to be beneficial in combating COVID-19 pathogenesis. Roflumilast is effective in patients with severe COPD by reducing the rate of exacerbations with the improvement of the lung function, which might further be beneficial for better clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: A cross-sectional mixed-method study was conducted involving an email-based, self-administered questionnaire sent on May 21, 2020, to 586 patients with MS followed at the MS Unit of Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, along with telephone interview, and review of electronic medical records until June 18, 2020. The cumulative incidence of confirmed COVID-19 (positive PCR or antibody test) and all COVID-19 cases (confirmed and suspected) from the start of the pandemic was compared with the population estimates for Barcelona. RESULTS: A total of 407 patients (69.5%) completed the survey. Most of the responders (67%) were female. The responders had a median age of 48 years (range 19-86), relapsing-remitting disease (84%), at least 1 comorbidity (45%), and were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT; 74.7%). COVID-19 was confirmed in 5 patients (1.2%) and suspected in 46 (11.3%). The cumulative incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases was similar to that of the general population but was almost 2-fold higher when all cases were considered (p < 0.001). Six patients (11.7%) were hospitalized, of which 5 had good recovery and 1 died. Hospitalized patients were more frequently male, had diabetes and had progressive forms of MS (p < 0.05). DMT was not associated with the risk of infection or the outcome.

281209,The BNT162b2 vaccine is associated with lower new COVID-19 cases in nursing home residents and staff,2021,"Introduction: COVID-19 virus has been known to be a major cause of mortality secondary to cytokine storm and respiratory failure. Other manifestations include GI symptoms, loss of taste and smell and thromboembolism. Here we introduce a case of suspected COVID-19 induced viral myocarditis in an 86 year old woman. Case presentation: An 86-year-old female with no reported past medical history, not on daily medications, was brought in by ambulance after fall and unable to get up for many hours. On presentation, she was in mild distress due to left sided musculoskeletal pain, afebrile, tachycardic, tachypneic, and saturating at 93% on room air. Patient denied chest pain throughout her hospitalization. Tenderness in the left chest wall, left upper and lower extremities was elicited on physical examination. Labs obtained were significant for a creatine kinase of 37,000 IU/L and troponin I of 9.93ng/mL. EKG showed nonspecific T wave abnormalities, and prolonged QTC of 548ms. Chest x-ray showed multifocal pneumonia with no features suggestive of trauma. She was admitted to telemetry for further management of COVID-91 pneumonia and cardiac work up. Her troponin I peaked to 12.52ng/mL and she was treated with empiric intravenous heparin and aspirin. Echocardiogram shows global hypokinesis with left ventricular ejection fraction of 35-40%. Heart failure regimen with beta blocker and aldosterone receptor blocker were started. Rhabdomyolysis normalized with intravenous fluids. For COVID-19 pneumonia, she received dexamethasone and remdesivir and was weaned to 4L oxygen on discharge. Discussion:Viral myocarditis often results from a combination of direct viral injury and subsequent cellular immune activation. There is limited knowledge for COVID-19 associated viral myocarditis;most documented cases are from existing case reports, where most patients are male, and under the age of 70 years. Diagnosis is often challenging, as endomyocardial biopsy is often forgone in the setting of the ongoing pandemic and increased infection risk. Treatment for viral myocarditis involves heart failure management followed by directed therapy based on suspected etiology. Lymphocytic myocarditis, as seen in the setting of COVID-19, would typically involve immunosuppression in the form of glucocorticoids and intravenous immunoglobulin;although these regimens have yet to be extensively studied in COVID-19 associated myocarditis. As literature on this infection is rapidly evolving, it is vital to recognize and document suspected cases. This case helps to establish presentation of COVID-19 induced viral myocarditis and facilitate future understanding and raises awareness of this extrapulmonary presentation.","Song, C.; Bedi, V.; Buragamadagu, B.

Materials and methods: PDA-XA-NPs were synthesized and characterized using transmission electron microscopy, zeta potential analysis and encapsulation efï¬ciency analysis. Their in vitro release kinetics and inhibitory effects on gastric cancer were studied. The adhesion of PDA-XA-NPs was evaluated by in vivo imaging atlas. The pharmacokinetics of PDA-XA-NPs and XA was compared. Results: PDA-XA-NPs had a spherical shape, a particle size of about 380 nm, an encapsulation efficiency of (82.1 ± 0.02) % and a drug loading capacity of (5.5 ± 0.1)%. The release of PDA-XA-NPs in PBS was stable and slow, without being affected by pH. The adhesion capacity of PDA-XA-NPs for mucin was significantly higher than that of bulk drug. The gastric mucosal retention of PDA-XA-NPs reached 89.1% which significantly exceeded that of XA. In vivo imaging showed that PDA-XA-NPs targeting the stomach were retained for a period of time. The pharmacokinetics study showed that PDA-XA-NPs had a longer retention time and a slower drug release than those of XA. In vitro experiments confirmed that PDA-XA-NPs exerted similar inhibitory effects on gastric cancer to those of XA, which lasted for a period of time. Conclusion: High-adhesion NPs were constructed. Gastric cancer was targeted by orally administered PDA-XA-NPs, as a potentially feasible therapy. Eventually, the bioavailability of XA was increased.","Zhou, Yaqian; Zhu, Xingyu; Lin, Shangyang; Zhu, Chenqi; Wu, Li; Chen, Rui; Chen, Zhipeng; Li, Weidong",Int J Nanomedicine,,136

The aim of this study was to evaluate tumour mismatch repair deficiency and prevalence of Lynch syndrome in high-risk women referred to the Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine with ovarian cancer over the past 20 years. METHODS: Women with ovarian cancer diagnosed before the age of 35 years and/or with a suggestive personal or family history of Lynch syndrome cancers underwent tumour testing with immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair deficiency and, where indicated, MLH1 promoter methylation testing followed by constitutional testing for Lynch syndrome. RESULTS: In total, 261 ovarian cancers were tested and 27 (10.3%; 95% CI 6.9% to 14.7%) showed mismatch repair deficiency by immunohistochemistry. Three of 7 with MLH1 loss showed MLH1 promoter hypermethylation, and 18 of the remaining 24 underwent constitutional testing for Lynch syndrome. A further 15 women with mismatch repair proficient tumours underwent constitutional testing because of a strong family history of Lynch syndrome cancers. Pathogenic variants were identified in 9/33 (27%) women who underwent constitutional testing, aged 33-59 years (median 48 years), including one whose tumour was mismatch repair proficient. Most Lynch syndrome tumours were of endometrioid histological subtype. CONCLUSIONS: Tumour mismatch repair deficiency identified by immunohistochemistry is a useful prescreen for constitutional testing in women with ovarian cancer with personal or family histories suggestive of Lynch syndrome.","Crosbie, Emma J; Ryan, Neil A J; McVey, Rhona J; Lalloo, Fiona; Bowers, Naomi; Green, Kate; Woodward, Emma R; Clancy, Tara; Bolton, James; Wallace, Andrew J; McMahon, Raymond F; Evans, D Gareth",J. medical. genet,,136
282573,Virucidal benefits of povidone-iodine use on the ocular surface: a review,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 has markedly varied clinical presentations, with most patients being asymptomatic or having mild symptoms. However, severe acute respiratory disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is common and associated with mortality in patients who require hospitalization. The etiology of susceptibility to severe lung injury remains unclear. Angiotensin II, converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) from angiotensin I and metabolized by ACE 2 (ACE2), plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of lung injury. ACE2 is identified as an essential receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cell. The binding of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 leads to the exhaustion and down-regulation of ACE2. The interaction and imbalance between ACE and ACE2 result in an unopposed angiotensin II. Considering that the ACE insertion (I)/deletion (D) gene polymorphism contributes to the ACE level variability in general population, in which mean ACE level in DD carriers is approximately twice that in II carriers, we propose a hypothesis of genetic predisposition to severe lung injury in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. It is plausible that the ACE inhibitors and ACE receptor blockers may have the potential to prevent and to treat the acute lung injury after SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially for those with the ACE genotype associated with high ACE level.","Zheng, Haoyi; Cao, J Jane",Am J Pathol,,136

The threat of a public health emergency catalyzed underlying xenophobic sentiments, manifesting them into racial discrimination of various degrees. With most discriminatory acts reported in liberal societies, this article investigates whether an economy more open to trade and migration can be more susceptible to xenophobia. Using our first-hand survey data of 1767 Chinese respondents residing overseas from 65 different countries during February of 2020, we adopt an instrumental variable strategy to identify the causal effect of openness to trade and migration of their residence country on the likelihood of them receiving discriminatory behaviors during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results show that greater openness to trade increases the likelihood of reported xenophobic behaviors, while openness to migration decreases it. On the other hand, stronger trade or immigration relationships with China are associated with less reported discrimination. And these effects primarily influence discriminatory behavior in interpersonal spaces, rather than through media outlets. Our findings highlight nuances of the effect of trade relations on the culture of a society.","He, Leshui; Zhou, Wen; He, Ming; Nie, Xuanhua; He, Jun",PLoS One,,136

Methods: Two hundred and twenty eight board-certified urologists completed our self-designed survey. An analysis was done to assess the increase in the use of telemedicine and the urologists' telemedicine experience responses. Data analysis was done using SPSS software. Results: There has been a tremendous increase in the use of telemedicine among urologists during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Most of the respondents of this study performed general urology as part of their daily practice (59.6%). Prior to the pandemic, 53.9% of the participants had never used any means of telemedicine. However, during the pandemic, 72.4% of urologists who had never used telemedicine began using the same. Almost all of the respondents agreed that physical examination is difficult when using telemedicine, which resulted in the highest mean value among the questionnaire items. Urologists below 35-year-old agreed, to a larger extent, that telemedicine saves them more time and is simple to use than urologists from other age groups. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, most urologists adopted telemedicine technology rapidly. Adopting telemedicine in the future could have multiple advantages.

289072,Protocol for a scoping review exploring the use of patient-reported outcomes in adult social care,2021,"In order to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on people's lives, activities and the natural environment, this paper investigates the spatial and temporal characteristics of Night Time Light (NTL) radiance and Air Quality Index (AQI) before and during the pandemic in mainland China. Our results show that the monthly average NTL brightness is much lower during the quarantine period than before. This study categorizes NTL into three classes: residential area, transportation and public facilities and commercial centers, with NTL radiance ranges of 5-20, 20-40 and greater than 40 nW/(cm*cm*sr), respectively. We found that the Number Of Pixels (NOP) with NTL detection increased in the residential area and decreased in the commercial centers for most of the provinces after the shutdown, while transportation and public facilities generally stayed the same. More specifically, we examined these factors in Wuhan, where the first confirmed cases were reported, and where the earliest quarantine measures were taken. Observations and analysis of pixels associated with commercial centers were observed to have lower NTL radiance values, indicating a dimming behavior, while residential area pixels recorded increased levels of brightness, after the beginning of the lockdown. The study also discovered a significant decreasing trend in the daily average AQI for the whole country, with cleaner air in most provinces during February and March, compared to January 2020. In conclusion, the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 has had a crucial impact on people's daily lives and activity ranges through the increased implementation of lockdown and quarantine policies. On the other hand, the air quality of China has improved with the reduction of non-essential industries and motor vehicle usage.","Liu, Qian; Sha, Dexuan; Liu, Wei; Houser, Paul; Zhang, Luyao; Hou, Ruizhi; Lan, Hai; Flynn, Colin; Lu, Mingyue; Hu, Tao; Yang, Chaowei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02808v1.pdf,136

The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) were used.Results: Females' anxiety risk was 3.01 times compared to males (95% CI 1.39-6.52). Compared with people below 40 years old, the anxiety risk of people above 40 years old was 0.40 times (95% CI 0.16-0.99). SDS results indicated that the difference between education level and occupation was statistically significant (p = 0.024, 0.005). Compared to people with a master's degree or above, those with a bachelor's degree group had a depression risk of 0.39 times (95% CI 0.17-0.87). Compared with professionals, industrial service workers and other staff had a depression risk of 0.31 times (95% CI 0.15-0.65) and 0.38 times (95% CI 0.15-0.93).Conclusions: 600 questionnaire participants were psychologically stable. Non-anxiety and non-depression rates were 93.67% and 82.83%, respectively. There were anxiety in 6.33% and depression in 17.17%. Therefore, we should pay attention to the psychological states of the public.","Wang, Yenan; Di, Yu; Ye, Junjie; Wei, Wenbin",Psychol Health Med,,136

It is based on participant observation of the man and his family as a case study. It demonstrates how the man turns kitchen work into a ""masculine"" job, and uses it as a contested terrain for constructing hegemonic masculinity by adopting scientific discourse explicitly and traditional patriarchal discourse implicitly. It also highlights women's conscious and deliberate interactions with the man in contributing to the making of hegemonic masculinity for the sake of their own values of happiness. The author seeks an understanding of the intersection of aging, patriarchal norms, and women's agency through the case of the co-production of a retired man's hegemonic masculinity in the context of the COVID-19 quarantine.","Han, Yuchen","Gender, work and organization",,136

In addition, much higher viral load in the bile juice than in the sputum indicated that a false positive error in the specimen was hardly possible. As far as we know, it is the first report about SARS-CoV-2 in the bile juice. We would love to share the information to other researchers.

293136,Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers,2021,"Health futures are not preordained, nor are they entirely predictable by extrapolation from the past. This is particularly relevant in an era of unprecedented uncertainties converging from the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple zoonotic outbreaks for the past two decades, and the climate crisis currently unfolding. Moreover, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services cautioned in 2019 that around one million animal and plant species are threatened with extinction. Human existence and medical innovations are closely intertwined with preservation and sustainability of biodiversity. COVID-19 is a ""dry run"" for future ecological crises in the 21st century. We need new frames and ways of conceptualizing planetary health, biodiversity futures, and their principled governance post-COVID-19. In this article, I propose ""One Nature"" as a critically informed planetary health governance frame, and outline its key conceptual pillars. One Nature aims to transcend the socially constructed binaries between humans versus nature, humans versus nonhuman animals or inanimate objects in nature, among other false binaries, and thus, envisions nature as an overlapping, interdependent, and co-constitutive continuum among life forms and ecosystems. One Nature also recognizes animal sentience and agency of nonhuman animals. In doing so, the One Nature governance frame places a firm emphasis on the internal levers of social change and the human values essential to cultivate collective action to curb unchecked extraction of nature that placed human societies in harm's way for future health crises. One Nature is a governance frame and reflexive value system that can be transformative to correct the astigmatism we have long suffered, from the ways in which we have conceived, enacted on, and extracted the natural systems over the centuries. All in all, One Nature supports planetary health and biodiversity through a new vocabulary and post-anthropocentric critical governance lens, and shall help formulate progressive policies to prevent zoonotic outbreaks and future ecological crises.","Özdemir, Vural",OMICS,,136

297516,RE: Association Between State-Level Income Inequality and COVID-19 Cases and Mortality in the USA,2021,"Corporate social responsibility implies business with concern for ethics, human rights, community needs, and investment in environmental protection. It is especially evident in crisis situations when the expectations of the environment about the application of these principles of the company are higher. The Covid-19 pandemic, as a crisis situation in which companies found themselves, led to changes in business models that had an impact on their stakeholders as well. In this segment, corporate social responsibility can be a useful and effective way to mitigate the potential effects of a pandemic and make it easier to deal with the consequences of a crisis. The aim of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework for the study of corporate social responsibility in crisis situations with special reference to the situation related to Covid-19. For this purpose, the research methodology includes a review of the literature on corporate social responsibility in this situation by classification into external (community, customer, and environment) and internal (employees) dimensions of the application of corporate social responsibility. The paper highlights the problems and challenges associated with corporate social responsibility in the Covid-19 pandemic and suggests further research opportunities in this area.","Šain, Marija PhD",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,,136

299490,Trajectory of psychosocial symptoms among home care patients with cancer at end-of-life,2020,"OBJECTIVES: In large cities, where a large proportion of the population live in poverty and overcrowding, orders to stay home to comply with isolation requirements are difficult to fulfil. In this article, the use of alternative care sites (ACSs) for the isolation of patients with confirmed COVID-19 or persons under investigation (PUI) in the City of Buenos Aires during the first wave of COVID-19 are described. STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study. METHODS: All patients with COVID-19 and PUI with insufficient housing resources who could not comply with orders to stay home and who were considered at low clinical risk in the initial triage were referred to refurbished hotels in the City of Buenos Aires (Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires [CABA]). ACSs were divided into those for confirmed COVID-19 patients and those for PUI. RESULTS: From March to August 2020, there were 58,143 reported cases of COVID-19 (13,829 of whom lived in slums) in the CABA. For COVID-19 positive cases, 62.1% (n = 8587) of those living in slums and 21.4% (n = 9498) of those living outside the slums were housed in an ACS. In total, 31.1% (n = 18,085) of confirmed COVID-19 cases were housed in ACSs. In addition, 7728 PUI were housed (3178 from the slums) in an ACS. The average length of stay was 9.0 ± 2.5 days for patients with COVID-19 and 1.6 ± 0.7 days for PUI. For the individuals who were housed in an ACS, 1314 (5.1%) had to be hospitalised, 56 were in critical care units (0.22%) and there were 27 deaths (0.1%), none during their stay in an ACS. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, about one-third of all people with COVID-19 were referred to an ACS in the CABA. For slum dwellers, the proportion was >60%. The need for hospitalisation was low and severe clinical events were rare. This strategy reduced the pressure on hospitals so their efforts could be directed to patients with moderate-to-severe disease.","Ferrante, Daniel; Macchia, Alejandro; González Villa Monte, Gabriel Alejo; Battistella, Gabriel; Baum, Analia; Zingoni, Paula; Angeleri, Patricia; Biscayart, Cristián; Walton, Carolina; Marcó, Florencia Flax; Esteban, Santiago; Mariani, Javier; Bernaldo de Quirós, Fernán Gonzalez",Public Health,,136

300004,Association of prurigo nodularis and infectious disease hospitalizations: a national cross-sectional study,2021,"BACKGROUND: The number of deaths from COVID-19 continues to surge worldwide. In particular, if a patient's condition is sufficiently severe to require invasive ventilation, it is more likely to lead to death than to recovery. OBJECTIVE: The goal of our study was to analyze the factors related to COVID-19 severity in patients and to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict the severity of COVID-19 at an early stage. METHODS: We developed an AI model that predicts severity based on data from 5601 COVID-19 patients from all national and regional hospitals across South Korea as of April 2020. The clinical severity of COVID-19 was divided into two categories: low and high severity. The condition of patients in the low-severity group corresponded to no limit of activity, oxygen support with nasal prong or facial mask, and noninvasive ventilation. The condition of patients in the high-severity group corresponded to invasive ventilation, multi-organ failure with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation required, and death. For the AI model input, we used 37 variables from the medical records, including basic patient information, a physical index, initial examination findings, clinical findings, comorbid diseases, and general blood test results at an early stage. Feature importance analysis was performed with AdaBoost, random forest, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost); the AI model for predicting COVID-19 severity among patients was developed with a 5-layer deep neural network (DNN) with the 20 most important features, which were selected based on ranked feature importance analysis of 37 features from the comprehensive data set. The selection procedure was performed using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, balanced accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: We found that age was the most important factor for predicting disease severity, followed by lymphocyte level, platelet count, and shortness of breath or dyspnea. Our proposed 5-layer DNN with the 20 most important features provided high sensitivity (90.2%), specificity (90.4%), accuracy (90.4%), balanced accuracy (90.3%), and AUC (0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed AI model with the selected features was able to predict the severity of COVID-19 accurately. We also made a web application so that anyone can access the model. We believe that sharing the AI model with the public will be helpful in validating and improving its performance.","Chung, Heewon; Ko, Hoon; Kang, Wu Seong; Kim, Kyung Won; Lee, Hooseok; Park, Chul; Song, Hyun-Ok; Choi, Tae-Young; Seo, Jae Ho; Lee, Jinseok",J Med Internet Res,,136

We contend that while labour abuses and occupational health deficiencies are morally unacceptable in the production of any commodity, an additional wrong is incurred when the health of certain populations is secured in ways that endanger the health and well-being of people working and living elsewhere. While some measures have been taken to better regulate the supply chain to healthcare providers in the UK, further action is needed to ensure that surgical goods are sourced from suppliers who protect the labour and occupational health rights of their workers.","Trueba, Mei L; Bhutta, Mahmood F; Shahvisi, Arianne",J. med. ethics,,136

''SARS-CoV2'', a previously unknown strain of coronaviruses caused a severe respiratory disease called Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which emerged from Wuhan city of China on 30 December 2019 and declared as Universal health problem by the World Health Organisation in a month. COVID-19 has created panic, and scientists are urged to test the efficiency and safety of drugs used to treat this disease. Various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available, and repurposing therapeutics for (COVID-19 has shown to be clinically effective). In the analytic stage, real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays remain the molecular test of choice for the etiologic diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection while antibody-based techniques are being introduced as supplemental tools. In the post-analytical stage, testing results should be cautiously interpreted using both molecular and serological findings. This review discusses the updates on specimens/samples and recent efficient diagnostics to control the disease. It covers the latest issues and challenges for the laboratory diagnosis of infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).","Shukla, P. V.; Upadhye, V.

Significant geographical and ethnic differences were described, and host genetic background seems to be important for the resistance to and mortality of COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism (rs4646994) is one of the candidates with the potential to affect infection symptoms and mortality. METHODS: In our study, we successfully genotyped 408 SARS-CoV-2-positive COVID-19 survivors (163 asymptomatic and 245 symptomatic) and compared them with a population-based DNA bank of 2,559 subjects. RESULTS: The frequency of ACE I/I homozygotes was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared with that in controls (26.2% vs. 21.2%; P = 0.02; OR [95% CI] = 1.55 [1.17-2.05].

303466,Pediatric emergency department volumes and throughput during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Recent advances in causal inference techniques, more specifically, in the theory of structural causal models, provide the framework for identification of causal effects from observational data in the cases where the causal graph is identifiable, i.e., the data generating mechanism can be recovered from the joint distribution. However, no such studies have been done to demonstrate this concept with a clinical example. We present a complete framework to estimate the causal effect from observational data by augmenting expert knowledge in the model development phase and with a practical clinical application. Our clinical application entails a timely and important research question, i.e., the effect of oxygen therapy intervention in the intensive care unit (ICU); the result of this project is useful in a variety of disease conditions, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients in the ICU. We used data from the MIMIC III database, a standard database in the machine learning community that contains 58,976 admissions from an ICU in Boston, MA, for estimating the oxygen therapy effect on morality. We also identified the covariate-specific effect to oxygen therapy from the model for more personalized intervention.","Gani, Md Osman; Kethireddy, Shravan; Bikak, Marvi; Griffin, Paul; Adibuzzaman, Mohammad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14774v1.pdf,136

However, concerns about the risk of expedited science have been raised. We aimed at reviewing and categorizing COVID-19-related medical research and to critically appraise peer-reviewed original articles. METHODS: The data sources were Pubmed, Cochrane COVID-19 register study, arXiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv, from 01/11/2019 to 01/05/2020. Peer-reviewed and preprints publications related to COVID-19 were included, written in English or Chinese. No limitations were placed on study design. Reviewers screened and categorized studies according to i) publication type, ii) country of publication, and iii) topics covered. Original articles were critically appraised using validated quality assessment tools. RESULTS: Among the 11,452 publications identified, 10,516 met the inclusion criteria, among which 7468 (71.0%) were peer-reviewed articles. Among these, 4190 publications (56.1%) did not include any data or analytics (comprising expert opinion pieces). Overall, the most represented topics were infectious disease (n = 2326, 22.1%), epidemiology (n = 1802, 17.1%), and global health (n = 1602, 15.2%). The top five publishing countries were China (25.8%), United States (22.3%), United Kingdom (8.8%), Italy (8.1%) and India (3.4%). The dynamic of publication showed that the exponential growth of COVID-19 peer-reviewed articles was mainly driven by publications without original data (mean 261.5 articles ± 51.1 per week) as compared with original articles (mean of 69.3 ± 22.3 articles per week). Original articles including patient data accounted for 713 (9.5%) of peer-reviewed studies. A total of 576 original articles (80.8%) showed intermediate to high risk of bias. Last, except for simulation studies that mainly used large-scale open data, the median number of patients enrolled was of 102 (IQR = 37-337). CONCLUSIONS: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of research is composed by publications without original data. Peer-reviewed original articles with data showed a high risk of bias and included a limited number of patients. Together, these findings underscore the urgent need to strike a balance between the velocity and quality of research, and to cautiously consider medical information and clinical applicability in a pressing, pandemic context.

While vaccines are still under development, social distancing, extensive testing, and quarantining of confirmed infected subjects remain the most effective measures to contain the pandemic. These measures carry a significant socioeconomic cost. In this work, we introduce a novel optimization-based decision-making framework for managing the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. This includes modeling the dynamics of affected populations, estimating the model parameters and hidden states from data, and an optimal control strategy for sequencing social distancing and testing events such that the number of infections is minimized. The analysis of our extensive computational efforts reveals that social distancing and quarantining are most effective when implemented early, with quarantining of confirmed infected subjects having a much higher impact. Further, we find that ""on-off"" policies alternating between strict social distancing and relaxing such restrictions can be effective at ""flattening"" the curve while likely minimizing social and economic cost.","Tsay, Calvin; Lejarza, Fernando; Stadtherr, Mark A; Baldea, Michael",Sci Rep,,136

These challenges can also arise due to the fear of being infected with COVID-19 and engaging in preventative behavior. This study investigated the mediating role of post-traumatic stress symptomology and psychological distress in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and preventive health behavior. A sample of 1172 individuals (mean age = 22.9 years, 54.5% females) participated in the online survey. Correlation analysis revealed that preventive health behavior has a positive relationship with fear of COVID-19 and post-traumatic stress symptomology but a negative relationship with psychological distress. Further analysis indicated that post-traumatic stress symptomology and psychological distress mediated the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and preventive health behavior. Post-traumatic stress symptomology caused by the fear of COVID-19 could contribute to improving preventive health behavior while psychological distress caused by the fear of COVID-19 tends to hinder preventive health behavior. It is recommended that public and private agencies should assist in promoting COVID-19 targeted education.

These regions are selected following the criterion according to which they are not folded, are exposed to the solvent and are not already present in the human body, so that they are not recognized by the immune system as self. Regions are selected using the primary sequence of the protein and, where possible, its tertiary structure.

Whether acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is safe and effective in aneurysm clipping remains largely unknown. METHODS: aSAH patients who underwent clipping surgery within 72 hours from bleeding were included. The patient in the ANH group received 400 mL autologous blood collection, and the blood was returned as needed during surgery. The relationships between ANH and perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion, postoperative outcome, complications were analyzed. RESULTS: 62 aSAH patients were included between December 2019 and June 2020, 20 in ANH group and 42 in non-ANH group. ANH did not reduce the need of perioperative blood transfusion (3 [15%] vs 5 [11.9%], P = 0.734). However, ANH significantly increased serum hemoglobin levels on postoperative day 1 (11.5 ± 2.5 g/dL vs 10.3 ± 2.0 g/dL, P = 0.045) and day 3 (12.1 ± 2.0 g/dL vs 10.7 ± 1.3 g/dL, P = 0.002). Multivariable analysis indicated that serum hemoglobin levels on postoperative day 1 (OR =0.895, 95% CI = 0.822-0.973, P = 0.010) was an independent risk factors for unfavorable outcome, and ROC curve analysis showed that it had a comparable predictive power as WFNS grade (Z =0.275, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ANH significantly increased postoperative hemoglobin levels, and it may hold the potential to improve patients' outcomes. Routine use of ANH should be considered in aneurysm clipping surgery.","Chen, Ping; Wang, Ying; Zhang, Xin-Huang; Kang, De-Zhi; Lin, Xian-Zhong; Lin, Qing-Song",World neurosurgery (Online),,136

We aimed to describe the dominant ABO group and outcomes of critically ill patients (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and mortality) in a Saudi Arabian setting. Methods: We conducted an observational, analytic cross-sectional, retrospective study in a tertiary care hospital. Around 90 candidates tested positive for COVID-19 were enrolled in this study during admission to critical care unit between May 2020 and September 2020. Blood group was detected in all patients included in the study during admission to critical care unit. Results: In this study, data of 90 patients with COVID-19 admitted to critical care unit were collected. Some prevalent medical conditions were collected, in which hypertension (64.2%) and diabetes mellitus (58.9%) were the most reported comorbidities among patients and there was no significant difference between groups. Most of the sample had blood group of O (45.6%), while the least group was AB (5.6%). Patients with blood group of A/AB showed the highest mortality vs. group O/B (32% vs. 18.5%) with significant P value of 0.001. Patients of groups A/AB had higher risk for intubation than O/B groups (52.0% and 49.2%, respectively;confidence interval of 0.44 - 2.8 with insignificant P value of 0.055). Length of stay in critical care unit was significantly higher in group A/AB with a mean course of 18.20 days in comparison to group O/B with a mean course of 12.63 days (P = 0.033). Conclusion: Our data indicate that critically ill patients with COVID-19 with blood group A/AB are at increased risk of mortality and length of stay in critical care unit, with insignificant requirement of mechanical ventilation when compared with patients with blood group O/B. Future larger studies are needed to validate and understand the underlying mechanisms.","Al-Ansari, R.

METHODS: Multicenter, prospective study of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Internal Medicine units. All patients were screened for DVT of the lower limbs with serial CUS. Anticoagulation was defined as: low dose (enoxaparin 20-40 mg/day or fondaparinux 1.5-2.5 mg/day); intermediate dose (enoxaparin 60-80 mg/day); high dose (enoxaparin 120-160 mg or fondaparinux 5-10 mg/day or oral anticoagulation). The primary end-point of the study was the diagnosis of DVT by CUS. RESULTS: Over a two-month period, 227 consecutive patients with moderate-severe COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled. The incidence of DVT was 13.7% (6.2% proximal, 7.5% distal), mostly asymptomatic. All patients received anticoagulation (enoxaparin 95.6%) at the following doses: low 57.3%, intermediate 22.9%, high 19.8%. Patients with and without DVT had similar characteristics, and no difference in anticoagulant regimen was observed. DVT patients were older (mean 77±9.6 vs 71±13.1 years; p = 0.042) and had higher peak D-dimer levels (5403 vs 1723 ng/mL; p = 0.004). At ROC analysis peak D-dimer level >2000 ng/mL (AUC 0.703; 95% CI 0.572-0.834; p = 0.004) was the most accurate cut-off value able to predict DVT (RR 3.74; 95%CI 1.27-10, p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of DVT in acutely ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is relevant. A surveillance protocol by serial CUS of the lower limbs is useful to timely identify DVT that would go otherwise largely undetected.","Pieralli, Filippo; Pomero, Fulvio; Giampieri, Margherita; Marcucci, Rossella; Prisco, Domenico; Luise, Fabio; Mancini, Antonio; Milia, Alessandro; Sammicheli, Lucia; Tassinari, Irene; Caldi, Francesca; Innocenti, Francesca; Faraone, Antonio; Beltrame, Chiara; Pini, Riccardo; Ungar, Andrea; Fortini, Alberto",PLoS One,,136

Here, we highlight that our model only requires basic patients' basic personal data, allowing for them to judge their own severity. We selected the boosting-based decision tree model as a classifier and interpreted mortality as a probability score after modeling. Specifically, hyperparameters that determine the structure of the tree model were tuned using the Bayesian optimization technique without any knowledge of medical information. As a result, we measured model performance and identified the variables affecting the severity through the model. Finally, we aim to establish a medical system that allows patients to check their own severity and informs them to visit the appropriate clinic center based on the past treatment details of other patients with similar severity.","Hwang, Hyung Ju; Jung, Seyoung; Park, Min Sue; Jo, Hyeontae",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09001v1.pdf,136
315650,A Crisis within a Crisis: COVID-19 and Hunger in African Children,2021,"Context: Notwithstanding the recognizable impact on public health, knowledge regarding this virus remains inadequate. Aims: This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of medical and allied health students regarding COVID-19 and its relationship to their demographic information. Setting and Design: This study was conducted at the University of Hail, Hail region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This study used a quantitative comparative-correlational design. Materials and Methods: There were 232 students recruited as respondents resulting from convenience sampling. A Google Forms survey was used to collect the data from March 2, 2020, until April 15, 2020. Statistical Analysis Used: One-way ANOVA, t-test, and Pearson's correlation test were used to analyze the data. Results: The participants had good knowledge, positive attitudes, and good practices on COVID-19. Of all the variables tested, only gender (P &lt; 0.002) has statistical difference to knowledge. The Pearson's results showed no significant relationship between knowledge and attitudes (P &gt; 0.5), knowledge and practices (P &gt; 0.5), or attitudes and practices (P &gt; 0.5). Conclusion: With the good knowledge, positive attitudes, and good practices of the participants about COVID-19, it is inferred that they can help to do information dissemination needed by the community. As females found to be more knowledgeable than males, female involvement in prevention and information of COVID-19 in the family dynamics of the Saudi context is worth considering. Moreover, male participants' knowledge should be improved through health education. © 2021 Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Sciences ;Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","Pasay-An, E.; Gonzales, F.; Alreshidi, M.

331586,Breaking News: All We Know about COVID-19 Transmission,2020,"""TCM syndrome of plague attack lung"" is a classification of traditional Chinese medicine syndromes of the novel coronavirus pneumonia by the Beijing Municipal Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine. In this study, a mouse model combining disease with syndrome of human coronavirus pneumonia with cold-dampness pestilence attacking the lung was established for the first time, and the therapeutic effect of matrine sodium chloride injection was evaluated based on immune regulation and inflammatory damage. Lung index, lung index inhibition rate and HE stain were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of matrine sodium chloride injection on the model mice; the viral load in lung tissue was measured by RT-PCR to evaluate its antiviral effect; the percentage of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and B cells were detected by flow cytometry to evaluate its immunomodulatory effect; the production of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) were measured by ELISA to evaluate its anti-inflammatory effect. All interventions and operations in the experiment were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Beijing Experimental Animal Ethics Committee. The results showed that intraperitoneal injection of the high-dose (36.67 mL·kg-1·d-1) and low-dose (18.33 mL·kg-1·d-1) of matrine sodium chloride injection significantly improved the pathological damage of lung tissue and reduced lung index. The lung index inhibition rates were 86.86% and 76.53%, respectively. The production of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, as well as the viral load in lung tissue were reduced significantly compared to the model; the percentage of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and B cells in peripheral blood were increased compared to the model. These results indicated that the matrine sodium chloride injection has an evident therapeutic effect on the model, and its mechanism was related to the inhibition virus replication, regulation of immunity function and inhibition of inflammatory factor release. This study provided laboratory data support for matrine sodium chloride injection which was used to treat the novel coronavirus pneumonia in clinical in Hubei province. These results indicated that the matrine sodium chloride injection has a good prospect for prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus pneumonia.","SUN, Jing; ZHAO, Rong-hua; GUO, Shan-shan; SHI, Yu-jing; BAO, Lei; GENG, Zi-han; GAO, Ying-jie; LIU, Jian; Qiong, LI; CUI, Xiao-lan",Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica,,136

Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses an analytical survey study of 137 Chinese academic libraries using data collected through a combination of website investigation, social media access and direct correspondences. Findings: Over 94% of Chinese academic libraries released COVID-19-related information through their websites; the majority switched their service focus to partly or solely remotely online, including remote access, free electronic resources, virtual references reachable 24/7 and research support services deliverable online; services of print materials were altered to e-books for conveniences. Research limitations/implications: It should be noted that the survey was conducted from February 12 to April 5, 2020; because of the rapid updates to the library's website and social media channels, the status of their patron services are in the process of dynamic changes and that there should be many libraries that have adopted some patron service methods, but this study is difficult to cover comprehensively. In addition, patron services carried out offline by the surveyed libraries but not disclosed on the online platform could not be analyzed in a way that would be consistent with the data provided by the survey. Originality/value: By providing evidence of the current status of patron services in Chinese academic libraries during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study helps fulfill the scant empirical attention given to the impact of nationwide public health crises on academic libraries and offers new data of the best practices that help library administrators enhance the impact, efficiency and value of library services to their target community users.","Guo, Yajun; Yang, Zinan; Yang, Zhishun; Liu, Yan Quan; Bielefield, Arlene; Tharp, Gregory",Libr.

332311,Weathering the Storm: Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Clinical and Non-clinical Healthcare Workers in India,2021,"Effective control of COVID-19 requires antivirals directed against SARS-CoV-2. We assessed 10 hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease-inhibitor drugs as potential SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. There is a striking structural similarity of the substrate binding clefts of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and HCV NS3/4A protease. Virtual docking experiments show that these HCV drugs can potentially bind into the Mpro substrate-binding cleft. We show that seven HCV drugs inhibit both SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease activity and SARS-CoV-2 virus replication in Vero and/or human cells. However, their Mpro inhibiting activities did not correlate with their antiviral activities. This conundrum is resolved by demonstrating that four HCV protease inhibitor drugs, simeprevir, vaniprevir, paritaprevir, and grazoprevir inhibit the SARS CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro). HCV drugs that inhibit PLpro synergize with the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir to inhibit virus replication, increasing remdesivir's antiviral activity as much as 10-fold, while those that only inhibit Mpro do not synergize with remdesivir.","Bafna, Khushboo; White, Kris; Harish, Balasubramanian; Rosales, Romel; Ramelot, Theresa A; Acton, Thomas B; Moreno, Elena; Kehrer, Thomas; Miorin, Lisa; Royer, Catherine A; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Krug, Robert M; Montelione, Gaetano T",Cell Rep,,136

333855,Changes in Sexual Functions and Alexithymia Levels of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become the most emerging health issue globally. A prompt investigation regarding disease management and treatment is crucial for decreasing the burden of the disease. Many explorations and hypotheses have been posed, but the definite treatment has not been determined for COVID-19. Recent studies described a substantial prevalence of COVID-19 and also a higher rate of morbidity and mortality in men afflicted with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The gender-related discordance in COVID-19 infection may be due to hormonal differences, socioeconomic factors, genetic susceptibility, gender-related comorbidities, and habits like alcohol consumption. On the other hand, several studies proposed that androgens could improve the immune system and have a protective role in COVID-19, and decreased levels of androgens might be associated with unsatisfactory outcomes. In the field of dermatology, androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is correlated with a hyperandrogenic state and may be related to COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, recent research has assessed the plausible association of AGA and COVID-19. In this review, we investigate all evidence on AGA and its relationship with COVID-19, including the possible role of androgens in COVID-19 severity and outcomes as well as candidate androgen-related drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.

We forecast the possible COVID-19 outbreak in one US state (Utah) by applying empirical data from South Korea and Italy, two countries that implemented disparate public health actions. Forecasts were created by aligning the start of the pandemic in Utah with that in South Korea and Italy, getting a short-run forecast based on actual daily rates of spread, and long-run forecast by employing a log-logistic model with four parameters. Applying the South Korea model, the epidemic peak in Utah is 169 cases/day, with epidemic resolution by the end of May. Applying the Italy model, new cases are forecast to exceed 200/day by mid-April, with the potential for 250 new cases a day at the epidemic peak, with the epidemic continuing through the end of August. We identify a 3-month variation in the likely length of the pandemic, a 1.5-fold difference in the number of daily infections at outbreak peak, and a 3-fold difference in the expected cumulative cases when applying the experience of two developed countries in handling this virus to the Utah context.","Qeadan, Fares; Honda, Trenton; Gren, Lisa H; Dailey-Provost, Jennifer; Benson, L Scott; VanDerslice, James A; Porucznik, Christina A; Waters, A Blake; Lacey, Steven; Shoaf, Kimberley",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,136
337387,Glycemic Control Improvement in Italian Children and Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes Followed Through Telemedicine During Lockdown Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Cytokine storms, defined by the dysregulated and excessive production of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, are closely associated with the pathology and mortality of several infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Effective therapies are urgently needed to block the development of cytokine storms to improve patient outcomes, but approaches that target individual cytokines may have limited effect due to the number of cytokines involved in this process. Dysfunctional macrophages appear to play an essential role in cytokine storm development, and therapeutic interventions that target these cells may be a more feasible approach than targeting specific cytokines. Nanomedicine-based therapeutics that target macrophages have recently been shown to reduce cytokine production in animal models of diseases that are associated with excessive proinflammatory responses. In this mini-review, we summarize important studies and discuss how macrophage-targeted nanomedicines can be employed to attenuate cytokine storms and their associated pathological effects to improve outcomes in patients with severe infections or other conditions associated with excessive pro-inflammatory responses. We also discuss engineering approaches that can improve nanocarriers targeting efficiency to macrophages, and key issues should be considered before initiating such studies.","Liu, Jingping; Wan, Meihua; Lyon, Christopher J; Hu, Tony Y",Theranostics,,136

338322,Addressing the psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers: learning from a systematic review of early interventions for frontline responders,2021,"Cephalosporin antibiotics are ubiquitous emerging pollutants in various aquatic environments due to their extensive production and application. Herein, the radiolytic degradation of antibiotic Cephalosporin C (CEP-C) in different water matrices was comprehensively investigated using gamma radiation at various experimental conditions. The results revealed that CEP-C oxidation obeyed pseudo first-order kinetics, and 100%, 94.9%, 67.0%, 44.6% and 34.5% removal of CEP-C with 10-200 mg/L was achieved at 0.4 kGy, respectively. The degradation was faster at higher absorbed dose and acidic conditions (pH = 3.5). The inorganic anions, including SO42-, NO3-, and HCO3-, had negative influence on the degradation of CEP-C, the corresponding rate constant decreased from 4.603 to 3.667, 1.677 and 2.509 kGy-1 respectively in the presence of SO42-, NO3-, and HCO3-. The analysis of intermediate products indicated that CEP-C was oxidized to generate about 10 intermediate products. Besides, it was inferred that the thioether sulfur oxidation, ß-lactam ring opening, acetyl dissociation from dihydrothiazine ring and D-&#945;-aminohexylamide group abscission were the major reaction mechanisms of CEP-C degradation by gamma radiation. Importantly, the antibacterial activity of CEP-C could be completely vanished by gamma radiation alone, while more toxic intermediate products might be formed. Addition of hydrogen peroxide and peroxymonosulfate could significantly improve the CEP-C degradation, and reduce the toxicity of intermediates of CEP-C degradation. Similar degradation behavior was observed in the groundwater and wastewater, implying that ionizing radiation can be used for degradation of Cephalosporin in water and wastewater.","Chen, Xiaoying; Wang, Jianlong",Sci Total Environ,,136

Slow vital capacity (SVC) was canceled in some countries to prevent COVID-19 transmission. We aimed to test phrenic nerve motor responses as an option to SVC in clinical trials. Methodology: Patients followed-up in our unit were selected respecting inclusion criteria used elsewhere: possible/probable/definite disease; onset-age 18-80years; disease duration from disease duration &#8804;24months; body mass index (BMI)>20kg/m2; respiratory subscore of the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R)&#8805;11; upright SVC &#8805; 70%. We added normal phrenic responses (meanPhrenAmpl, &#8805;0.4mV). All patients were on riluzole. SVC and meanPhrenAmpl were recorded at study entry (T0) and 24 weeks later (T1). Decays were determined. Sample size was calculated for a treatment effect of 30% on the decay rate. Results: We included 317 ALS patients (191 males, 225 spinal-onset), mean onset-age 59.9 ± 10.7 (31-80)years, mean onset BMI 25.48 ± 3.2 (20.1-35)kg/m2, mean disease duration 10.5 ± 5.6 (1-24)months, mean ALSFRS-R 41.54 ± 4.3 (22-47) and respiratory subscore 11.83 ± 0.38 (11-12).

For the proposed drug effect, 174 and 272 patients would be needed to recruit using respectively meanPhrenAmpl and SVC decline as the primary outcome measurement (accepting no dropouts). Discussion: Contrary to SVC, meanPhrenAmpl is non-volitional and not associated with aerosolization risk. Lower recruitment number (98 patients less) would be needed, translating shorter inclusion period, trial length and costs, and probable lower missed data rate. MeanPhrenAmp is an alternative test in ALS clinical trials.","Pinto, Susana; De Carvalho, Mamede",Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,,136

338412,Public Attitudes About COVID-19 in Response to President Trump's Social Media Posts,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has been associated with a high morbidity, mortality, and a risk of long-term sequelae, and patients with severe COVID-19 are at increased risk of acute kidney injury. CKD patients are at high risk of being exposed to COVID-19 and suffer complications and poor outcome. In Sweden, mitigation strategies did not include lockdown. During March-April of 2020, wide-spread infection occurred in Stockholm. METHODS: Management and outcomes in forty hemodialysis (HD) patients and 4 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, with symptomatic COVID-19 in greater Stockholm during March and April of 2020 are reported. RESULTS: Twenty-four HD patients (60%) required medical care and hospitalization, whereas 16 patients (40%) were treated at home. Nine patients died (mortality rate of 22.5%), of whom 8 were men. The median age in non-survivors (78 years) was significantly higher than in survivors (p = 0.003). The median time in dialysis (11.5 years) was also significantly longer in non-survivors (p = 0.01). C-reactive protein (CRP) at diagnosis in 7 of non-survivors (median 213 mg/L, range 86-329 mg/L) was significantly higher than the CRP in 25 survivors (median 87 mg/L, range 1-328 mg/L) (p = 0.0003). Maximum CRP also indicated poorer outcome among hospitalized patients (p = 0.0004). The gender imbalance was striking with only men dying apart from 1 elderly woman. Only 4 PD patients were hospitalized with symptomatic COVID-19. One patient died, 2 were discharged, and 1 was treated at the intensive care unit and survived. CONCLUSION: HD patients >70 years were reported with longer dialysis vintage, higher CRP, and males were at an increased risk of dying from COVID-19, whereas those <70 years seemed to have a milder disease. Mitigation strategies to reduce rates of infection in high-risk populations remain essential. Follow-up focusing on long-term prognosis for extrapulmonary manifestations is likely to be important also in dialysis patients.","Smolander, Jessica; Bruchfeld, Annette",Kidney Blood Press Res,,136

339045,Trends in US Internal Medicine Residency and Fellowship Applications During the COVID-19 Pandemic vs Previous Years,2021,"Recently, the novel coronavirus epidemic occurred in China and spread worldwide to become a global pandemic. COVID-19 is a fatal viral infection causing death, particularly in aged individuals, due to impaired immunity. To date, no intervention is available to prevent COVID-19 and its manifestations. Physical exercise training generally has health benefits, and it assists in the prevention of several chronic diseases. Therefore, this review is aimed at exploring the role of physical exercise training in the face of COVID-19 in older adults and elderly individuals. From this point of view, this review suggests that physical exercise training plays a key role in promoting immune system regulation, delaying immunity dysfunction, reducing circulatory inflammation markers, and preventing sarcopenia and thus could prevent the risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection and reduce the complications of recommended self-isolation in older adults and elderly individuals. Additionally, immunity biomarkers were optimistically demonstrated in older adults following physical exercise training, thereby reducing mortality and morbidity rates. Finally, in accordance with recommendations to stay home and perform self-isolation to prevent the spread of COVID-19, all populations are strongly recommended to practice regular home exercise training at home to promote immune system functioning.","Abdelbasset, Walid Kamal",J Immunol Res,,136
339433,Drug Overdose Deaths Before and After Shelter-in-Place Orders During the COVID-19 Pandemic in San Francisco,2021,"Objective: To evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) status and explore its associated factors in pediatric medical staff during the COVID-19 epidemic so as to provide fundamental evidence for clinicians and administrators to formulate targeted intervention measures to improve the HRQoL and mental health status in pediatric medical staff during this, and future pandemics. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the HRQoL of pediatric medical staff. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to analyze the associated factors. Results: A total of 2,997 participants were recruited. Females scored worse than males in terms of emotional functioning (OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.1) and cognitive functioning (OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.8). The respondents aged 30-39 and 40-49 years scored worse in nearly all domains of HRQoL compared health care professionals under 30 years old. Respondents with high education had lower scores in physical functioning (OR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0-1.7) and emotional functioning (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.9). Compared with doctors, nurses had higher scores in all domains except for summary score and worry. The respondents whose working places had not set up pediatric fever clinics and isolated observation areas independently had lower scores in all domains except for worry. The respondents who had ever treated patients with COVID-19 had lower scores in all domains. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 outbreak, the HRQoL of pediatric medical staff decreased. The factors associated with HRQoL can be used to develop intervention to improve HRQoL in pediatric medical staff.","Huang, Feng; Yang, Zhe; Wang, Yue; Zhang, Wei; Lin, Yan; Zeng, Ling-Chao; Jiang, Xun; Shang, Lei",Front Public Health,,136

340644,IDSA made 4 strong recommendations for preventing COVID-19 infection in health care personnel,2021,"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to maintain self-isolation, the vast majority of outpatient services are closed, and the inpatient clinics have limited the workload admitting almost only urgent cases. Outpatients, including ones with various sleep disorders, are left without access to the specialized examinations. This will lead to the late diagnosis and untimely therapy prescriptions. In such conditions, it is relevant to take into account new instrumental diagnostic methods that could be used by the patient themselves to register their vital parameters at home. The obtained data can be transmitted via the Internet to the attending physician for further analysis followed by prescriptions when required. One of these methods is bioradiolocation, which allows noncontact recording of breathing patterns, heart rate and movement of a person during sleep, as well as detection of various sleep disorders and determination of sleep stages. This method is easy to use, and can be recommended for home-screening by patients. Sleep has a significant immunomodulating function, and sleep assessment is important in both patients at risk and afflicted with novel coronavirus infection. Thus, the use of bioradiolocation method at home for non-contact sleep monitoring may be relevant in case of closure of outpatient facilities and will provide the doctor with objective data on sleep patterns and patterns of breathing, motor activity, the presence and amount of respiratory disturbances during sleep.","Anishchenko, L.

343365,COVID-19 and the Need for Adult Day Services,2021,"Denmark has achieved remarkable success in renewable energy generation over the last several decades. However, the country's goals of meeting its 50% energy demand from renewable by 2030 and becoming independent of fossil fuel by 2050 are currently in jeopardy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged at the end of December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan. This study, therefore, tries to see how COVID-19 affects renewable electricity generation in Denmark using the advanced econometric framework. Several nonlinear estimation techniques such as Fourier ADL cointegration analysis and Markov Switching regression are used to estimate the relationship between the three channels of COVID-19 and renewable electricity generation. The result from the Markov Switching regression reveals that renewable electricity production in Denmark is adversely affected by the enforced lockdown as captured via the stringency index, economic support provided to tackle the pandemic, and daily confirmed deaths of COVID-19. Moreover, the causality test shows that the stringency index and daily confirmed deaths of COVID-19 are important predictors of renewable electricity, but the economic support index has weak causality with renewable electricity. The study finally presents some crucial policy suggestions for Denmark which can help the country achieve its renewable production goals. [Display omitted] • The relationship between COVID-19 and renewable electricity production in Denmark is investigated. • Non-linear estimation techniques are used. • COVID-19 has a multiplier and negative effect on renewable generation. • Denmark requires strategic actions to maintain its process of becoming fossil fuel free in the post-COVID world.

METHODS: We did a retrospective study and included COVID-19 patients admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between 1 February and 29 February 2020. Antibody assay was conducted to detect COVID-19 envelope protein E and nucleocapsid protein N antigen. RESULTS: One hundred twelve patients were recruited with symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, and diarrhea. All patients underwent antibody tests. Fifty-eight (51.79%) were positive for both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), 7 (6.25%) were negative for both antibodies, 1 (0.89%) was positive for only IgM, and 46 (41.07%) were positive for only IgG. IgM antibody appeared within a week post-disease onset, lasted for 1 month, and gradually decreased, whereas IgG antibody was produced 10 days after infection and lasted for a longer time. However, no significant difference in levels of IgM and IgG antibodies between positive and negative patients of nucleic acid test after treatment was found. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that serological tests could be a powerful approach for the early diagnosis of COVID-19.","Zhang, Guoxin; Nie, Shuke; Zhang, Zhaohui; Zhang, Zhentao",J Infect Dis,,136

This study set out to investigate the impact mechanism of online learning user satisfaction from the perspective of cognitive load in the era of COVID-19 and explore ways to optimize cognitive load in teaching practice. Semi-structured interviews were conducted for the empirical analysis. The coding process of the interviews yielded several antecedents of cognitive load in the online learning process. We also proposed a theoretical model based on the literature review and data analysis. Findings of the qualitative analysis indicate that the antecedents of cognitive load are multi-dimensional and the user's satisfaction with the online learning platform mainly consists of the expected confirmation of the information system and the perceived usefulness. These findings can help us think backward about optimizing user satisfaction with online learning in the context of COVID-19 breakout. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

346146,Clinician Perspectives on Caring for Dying Patients During the Pandemic : A Mixed-Methods Study,2020,"BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 led to the COVID-19 pandemic starting in January 2020. The Swiss Federal Council prescribed a lockdown of nonessential businesses. Students and employees of higher education institutions had to install home offices and participate in online lectures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey study was to evaluate lifestyle habits, such as physical activity (PA), sitting time, nutritional habits (expressed as median modified Mediterranean Diet Score [mMDS]), alcohol consumption habits, and sleeping behavior during a 2-month period of confinement and social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey participants were students and employees of a Swiss university of applied sciences. METHODS: All students and employees from Bern University of Applied Sciences, Department of Health Professions (ie, nursing, nutrition and dietetics, midwifery, and physiotherapy divisions) were invited to complete an anonymous online survey during the COVID-19 confinement period. Information on the lifestyle dimensions of PA, sitting time, nutritional and alcohol consumption habits, and sleep behavior was gathered using adaptations of validated questionnaires. Frequency analyses and nonparametric statistical methods were used for data analysis. Significance was set at 5% &#945; level of error. RESULTS: Prevalence of non-health-enhancing PA was 37.1%, with participants of the division of physiotherapy showing the lowest prevalence. Prevalence of long sitting time (>8 hours/day) was 36.1%. The median mMDS was 9, where the maximal score was 15, with participants of the division of nutrition and dietetics being more adherent to a Mediterranean diet as compared to the other groups. Prevalence of nonadherence to the Swiss alcohol consumption recommendations was 8.3%. Prevalence of low sleeping quality was 44.7%, while the median sleeping duration was 8 hours, which is considered healthy for adult populations. CONCLUSIONS: In the group analysis, differences in PA, sitting time, and mMDS were observed between different divisions of health professions as well as between Bachelor of Science students, Master of Science students, and employees. Therefore, public health messages regarding healthy lifestyle habits during home confinement should be more group specific. The results of this study may provide support for the implementation of group-specific health promotion interventions at universities in pandemic conditions.

346390,Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Among COVID-19 Survivors at 3-Month Follow-up After Hospital Discharge,2021,"OBJECTIVES: There is increasing evidence that thrombotic events occur in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We evaluated lung and kidney perfusion abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 by dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) and investigated the role of perfusion abnormalities on disease severity as a sign of microvascular obstruction. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with COVID-19 who underwent pulmonary DECT angiography and were suspected of having pulmonary thromboembolism were included. Pulmonary and kidney images were reviewed. Patient characteristics and laboratory findings were compared between those with and without lung perfusion deficits (PDs). RESULTS: DECT images showed PDs in eight patients (25.8%), which were not overlapping with areas of ground-glass opacity or consolidation. Among these patients, two had pulmonary thromboembolism confirmed by CT angiography. Patients with PDs had a longer hospital stay (p = 0.14), higher intensive care unit admission rates (p = 0.02), and more severe disease (p = 0.01). In the PD group, serum ferritin, aspartate aminotransferase, fibrinogen, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and troponin levels were significantly higher, whereas albumin level was lower (p < 0.05). D-dimer levels &#8805; 0.485 µg/L predicted PD with 100% specificity and 87% sensitivity. Renal iodine maps showed heterogeneous enhancement consistent with perfusion abnormalities in 13 patients (50%) with lower sodium levels (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: We found that a large proportion of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 had PDs in their lungs and kidneys, which may be suggestive of the presence of systemic microangiopathy with micro-thrombosis. These findings help in understanding the physiology of hypoxemia and may have implications in the management of patients with COVID-19, such as early indications of thromboprophylaxis or anticoagulants and optimizing oxygenation strategies. KEY POINTS: â¢ Pulmonary perfusion abnormalities in COVID-19 patients, associated with disease severity, can be detected by pulmonary DECT. â¢ A cutoff value of 0.485 µg/L for D-dimer plasma levels predicted lung perfusion deficits with 100% specificity and 87% sensitivity (AUROC, 0.957). â¢ Perfusion abnormalities in the kidney are suggestive of a subclinical systemic microvascular obstruction in these patients.","Idilman, Ilkay S; Telli Dizman, Gulcin; Ardali Duzgun, Selin; Irmak, Ilim; Karcaaltincaba, Musturay; Inkaya, Ahmet Cagkan; Demirkazik, Figen; Durhan, Gamze; Gulsun Akpinar, Meltem; Ariyurek, Orhan Macit; Akpinar, Erhan; Rello, Jordi; Akova, Murat; Akata, Deniz",Eur. radiol,,136

346653,End-of-life and goals of care discussions with cancer patients in the coronavirus pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Mental health problems are increasingly recognized as a significant and concerning secondary effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research on previous epidemics/pandemics suggest that families, particularly mothers, may be at increased risk, but this population has yet to be examined. The current study (1) described prevalence rates of maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms from an online convenience sample during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) identified risk and protective factors for elevated symptoms, and (3) described current mental health service use and barriers. METHODS: Participants (N = 641) were mothers of children age 0-8 years, including expectant mothers. Mothers completed an online survey assessing mental health, sociodemographic information, and COVID-19-related variables. RESULTS: Clinically-relevant depression was indicated in 33.16%, 42.55%, and 43.37% of mothers of children age 0-18 months, 18 months to 4 years, and 5 to 8 years, respectively. Prevalence of anxiety was 36.27%, 32.62%, and 29.59% for mothers across age groups, respectively. Binary logistic regressions indicated significant associations between risk factors and depression/anxiety across child age groups. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional data was used to describe maternal mental health problems during COVID-19 limiting the ability to make inferences about the long-term impact of maternal depression and anxiety on family well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal depression and anxiety appear to be elevated in the context of COVID-19 compared to previously reported population norms. Identified risk factors for depression and anxiety across different child age ranges can inform targeted early intervention strategies to prevent long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on family well-being and child development.","Cameron, Emily E; Joyce, Kayla M; Delaquis, Chantal P; Reynolds, Kristin; Protudjer, Jennifer L P; Roos, Leslie E",J Affect Disord,,136

METHODS: Patient data was abstracted from medical records at Weill Cornell Medical Center. RESULTS: Four patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and PRES were identified. The patients' ages ranged from 64 to 74 years, and two were women. All four patients were admitted to the hospital with acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation. PRES was diagnosed after persistent confusion, lethargy, new focal neurological deficits, or seizures were noted, with evidence of seizures on electroencephalogram for two of the patients. Imaging confirmed the presence of cerebral vasogenic edema. All four patients had elevated blood pressure and renal injury in the days preceding PRES diagnosis, as well as evidence of systemic inflammation and systemic hypercoagulability. Symptoms of PRES improved with blood pressure control. CONCLUSIONS: Our four cases demonstrate the occurrence of PRES in critically-ill patients with COVID-19. PRES should be considered in the differential for acute neurological deficits and seizures in this setting.","Parauda, Sarah C; Gao, Virginia; Gewirtz, Alexandra N; Parikh, Neal S; Merkler, Alexander E; Lantos, Joshua; White, Halina; Leifer, Dana; Navi, Babak B; Segal, Alan Z",J Neurol Sci,,136

The present paper introduces an adverse outcome pathway construct that mechanistically describes the pathways induced by SARS-CoV-2 leading to liver injury. This can be caused by direct binding of the virus and local actions in cholangiocytes, but may also indirectly result from the general state of hypoxia and systemic inflammation in COVID-19 patients. Further research is urgently needed to fill remaining knowledge gaps.

353353,Managing diabetes in Qatar during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"We used Bayesian model inversion to estimate epidemic parameters from the reported case and death rates from seven countries using data from late January 2020 to April 5th 2020. Two distinct generative model types were employed: first a continuous time dynamical-systems implementation of a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model and second: a partially observable Markov Decision Process (MDP) or hidden Markov model (HMM) implementation of an SEIR model. Both models parameterise the size of the initial susceptible population (S0), as well as epidemic parameters. Parameter estimation (data fitting) was performed using a standard Bayesian scheme (variational Laplace) designed to allow for latent unobservable states and uncertainty in model parameters. Both models recapitulated the dynamics of transmissions and disease as given by case and death rates. The peaks of the current waves were predicted to be in the past for four countries (Italy, Spain, Germany and Switzerland) and to emerge in 0.5-2 weeks in Ireland and 1-3 weeks in the UK. For France one model estimated the peak within the past week and the other in the future in two weeks. Crucially, Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of S0 for each country indicated effective population sizes of below 20% (of total population size), under both the continuous time and HMM models. With a Bayesian weighted average across all seven countries and both models, we estimated that 6.4% of the total population would be immune. From the two models the maximum percentage of the effective population was estimated at 19.6% of the total population for the UK, 16.7% for Ireland, 11.4% for Italy, 12.8% for Spain, 18.8% for France, 4.7% for Germany and 12.9% for Switzerland. Our results indicate that after the current wave, a large proportion of the total population will remain without immunity.","Moran, Rosalyn J.; Fagerholm, Erik D.; Cullen, Maell; Daunizeau, Jean; Richardson, Mark P.; Williams, Steven; Turkheimer, Federico; Leech, Rob; Friston, Karl J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05060v1.pdf,136

Many patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the University Hospital Aachen during an outbreak that first struck the Heinsberg district in February 2020. METHODS: A comparative presentation of the clinical features of the first 50 COVID-19 patients with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who were hospitalized in the University Hospital Aachen. RESULTS: 24 intubated patients were treated in the intensive care unit for ARDS of varying degrees of severity, while 26 patients who were breathing spontaneously without ARDS, but nevertheless needed supplemental oxygen, were treated in a separate isolation ward. The median age of the patients was 65 (IQR 58-76). The median latency from symptom onset to hospitalization was four days (IQR 1-8). Patients with ARDS had preexisting respiratory diseases more commonly than patients without ARDS (58% [95% confidence interval: 39; 76] versus 42% [26; 61]) and were more commonly overweight or obese (83% [64; 93] versus 42% [26; 61]). The two groups did not differ in viral burden but displayed significant differences in laboratory findings: ARDS patients had persistently elevated values for leukocytes, interleukin-6, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and D-dimers over the period of observation. Patients without ARDS had persistently elevated inflammatory parameters and fever for at least one week, with an accompanying need for supplemental oxygen. Three of the patients with ARDS died of multiorgan failure, while four in the non-ARDS group died of respiratory insufficiency. CONCLUSION: This initial description of a cohort of COVID-19 patients with and without ARDS in Germany reveals that those with ARDS more commonly have preexisting respiratory diseases and obesity, as well as persistently elevated inflammatory markers. COVID-19 patients without ARDS may likewise require prolonged hospitalization because of persistently elevated inflammatory values with a simultaneous need for supplemental oxygen.","Dreher, Michael; Kersten, Alexander; Bickenbach, Johannes; Balfanz, Paul; Hartmann, Bojan; Cornelissen, Christian; Daher, Ayham; Stöhr, Robert; Kleines, Michael; Lemmen, Sebastian W; Brokmann, Jörg Christian; Müller, Tobias; Müller-Wieland, Dirk; Marx, Gernot; Marx, Nikolaus",Dtsch Arztebl Int,,136

In addition to its anti-viral activity, the anti-inflammatory activity of chloroquine may also contribute to its efficacy. Based on our data obtained from an animal infection model of melioidosis (a disease caused by the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei), treatment with chloroquine can result in the phosphorylation and consequent inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3ß (GSK3ß). This serine/threonine protein kinase is now recognised as a point of convergence for host inflammatory response. In view of this, it is plausible that the mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effect of chloroquine against COVID-19 involves inhibition of host GSK3ß.","Embi, Mohammed Noor; Ganesan, Nagesswary; Sidek, Hasidah Mohd",Drug Discov Ther,,136

360860,The Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric surgery practice: A cross-sectional study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Burnout among physicians is an increasing concern, and surgeons are not immune to this threat. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused dramatic changes to surgeon workflow, often leading to redeployment to other clinical areas, slowdown and shutdown of elective surgery practices, and an uncertain future of surgical practice in the post-pandemic setting. Paradoxically, for many surgeons who had to prepare for but not immediately care for a major surge, the crisis did allow for reflective opportunities and a resetting of priorities that could serve to mitigate chronic patterns contributory to Burnout. METHODS: SAGES Reimagining the Practice of Surgery task force convened a webinar to discuss lessons learned from the COVID pandemic that may address burnout. RESULTS: Burnout is multifactorial and may vary in cause among different generation/experience groups. Those that report burnout symptoms often complain of lacking purpose or meaning in their work. Although many mechanisms to address Burnout are from a defensive standpoint-including coping mechanisms, problem solving, and identification of a physician having wellness difficulties-offensive mechanisms such as pursuing purpose and meaning and finding joy in one's work can serve as reset points that promote thriving and fulfillment. Understanding what motivates physicians will help physician leaders to develop and sustain effective teams. Reinvigorating the surgical workforce around themes of meaning and joy in the service rendered via our surgical skills may diminish Burnout through generative and aspirational strategies, as opposed to merely reactive ones. Fostering an educational environment free of discriminatory or demeaning behavior may produce a new workforce conducive to enhanced and resilient wellbeing at the start of careers. CONCLUSION: Surgeon wellness and self-care must be considered an important factor in the future of all healthcare delivery systems, a need reaffirmed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Romanelli, John; Gee, Denise; Mellinger, John D; Alseidi, Adnan; Bittner, James G; Auyang, Edward; Asbun, Horacio; Feldman, Liane S",Surg Endosc,,136

The efficacy of PD-1 blockade as compared with chemotherapy as first-line therapy for MSI-H-dMMR advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer is unknown. METHODS: In this phase 3, open-label trial, 307 patients with metastatic MSI-H-dMMR colorectal cancer who had not previously received treatment were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks or chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil-based therapy with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab) every 2 weeks. Patients receiving chemotherapy could cross over to pembrolizumab therapy after disease progression. The two primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS: At the second interim analysis, after a median follow-up (from randomization to data cutoff) of 32.4 months (range, 24.0 to 48.3), pembrolizumab was superior to chemotherapy with respect to progression-free survival (median, 16.5 vs. 8.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.80; P = 0.0002). The estimated restricted mean survival after 24 months of follow-up was 13.7 months (range, 12.0 to 15.4) as compared with 10.8 months (range, 9.4 to 12.2). As of the data cutoff date, 56 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 69 in the chemotherapy group had died. Data on overall survival were still evolving (66% of required events had occurred) and remain blinded until the final analysis. An overall response (complete or partial response), as evaluated with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, was observed in 43.8% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group and 33.1% in the chemotherapy group. Among patients with an overall response, 83% in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 35% of patients in the chemotherapy group, had ongoing responses at 24 months. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 22% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 66% (including one patient who died) in the chemotherapy group. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab led to significantly longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy when received as first-line therapy for MSI-H-dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer, with fewer treatment-related adverse events.

In fact, in addition to the immunodeficiency generated by chronic diseases conditions, COVID-19 led also to affect the immune system. Furthermore, the novel coronavirus attacks the lungs and other vital organs such as heart, kidneys, and brain. All these outcomes are accused to be involved in the increasing vulnerability and comorbidity in COVID-19-infected people with chronic diseases. Pharmacological, dietetic and natural approaches were suggested after a deep bibliographic research for presenting preventive recommendations for this category of patients in order to avoid the fatal complications of this infection, and consequently limiting the risk of comorbidity. In this regard, some medications could enter in interaction with COVID-19 infection in patients with diabetes or hypertension and thereafter lead to fatal complications. Furthermore, regarding their nutritional values some foods are more useful than others during this pandemic period because they are rich on vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and perhaps on some bioactive phytochemicals which are known be effective in improving immune response, managing chronic diseases and/or having antiviral activities. In addition, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, prebiotics and probiotics could be helpful in these conditions. Interestingly, in order to understand the mechanism of this causality and suggesting efficacious solutions, this review deserves considerable epidemiologic, clinical and experimental investigations.","Ajebli, Mohammed; Amssayef, Ayoub; Akdad, Mourad; Algharrass, Youness; Babakhouya, Abdelaadim; Ghanimi, Dris; Eddouks, Mohamed",Endocr. metab. immune disord. drug targets,,136

Current limited data on neonates with COVID-19 suggest that neonatal COVID-19 shows a relatively benign course despite a high requirement for mechanical ventilation. However, neonates with preiexisting medical conditions and preterm infants appear to be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. The greatest concern in perinatal aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic is the possibility of vertical transmission, especially transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Although direct evidence for vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still lacking, the possibility of vertical transmission during late pregnancy cannot be ruled out. This review summarizes available case studies on COVID-19 in neonates and introduces what is currently known about neonatal COVID-19, focusing on its vertical transmission.","Kim, Do-Hyun",,,136

Our faculty has quickly adapted the curricula to online formats. The online format seems to be more advantageous in terms of content material and virtual activities, but the results of these adjustments will require subsequent evaluation. The aim of this study was to evaluate medical student expectations of online orthopedics learning that was created based on social constructivism theory. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out to assess the fifth-year medical student expectations of our newly developed online orthopedics course during the outbreak. Constructivist Online Learning Environment Survey (COLLES) was applied for evaluating the expectations during orthopedic rotation. The survey contains six aspects based on social constructivist principles: relevance, reflection, interactivity, tutor support, peer support, and interpretation. All students responded to the preferred COLLES before starting the online course, and the actual COLLES was filled out when the online course was completed. Before and after attending the online course, the scores were compared and interpreted to assess student expectations. Results: A total of 126 fifth-year medical students studied the online orthopedic course. The preferred COLLES were completed by 125 students, while 120 students replied to the actual COLLES. The overall scores from the post-course survey in all aspects were significantly higher than scores from the pre-course with P-value &lt; 0.01. The comparison between the preferred and actual scores showed this online course fulfilled student expectations. Conclusion: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 19 has disrupted medical student education. The online orthopedic learning course in our department has been developed to deal with the current situation. Using the various activities based on social constructivism theory in the online platform was able to fulfill medical student expectations.","Suwannaphisit, S.; Anusitviwat, C.; Hongnaparak, T.; Bvonpanttarananon, J.",Annals of Medicine and Surgery,,136

374095,Emergency department administration of COVID-19 antibody therapies: Early experience,2021,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19 or coronavirus disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from Wuhan, China, the cardiology fraternity's interest has been drawn towards the pandemic with a high case fatality rate of 10.5% and 6% in patients with heart disease and hypertension, respectively. One of the postulated mechanisms for this high fatality rate is the possible abundance of ACE type 2 receptor in the cardiovascular system that strongly binds with the spike protein of COVID-19 and helps internalise into the cell resulting in acute cardiac injury (ACI). More than 7% of cases with COVID-19 are reported to have this type of ACI. A tenfold rise in mortality has been observed in patients with COVID-19 who experience a rise in high-sensitivity (hs)-troponin. All most half of the patients who died of COVID-19 had a rise in hs-troponin. More than 15% of cases with COVID-19 experienced different types of arrhythmias. All these statistics denote how important cardiovascular pathology is in patients with COVID-19. Controversies of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors usage in patients with COVID-19 and meticulous handling of case with acute coronary syndrome categorically stresses cardiologists to bust the myths hovering around and set a standard guideline to counterfeit the fatality with timely diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19-induced ACI. In this review, we sought to summarise the current evidence of COVID-19-associated cardiac injury and suggest the implications for its proper diagnosis and treatment.","Shaha, Kunal Bikram; Manandhar, Dhiraj Narayan; Cho, Jung Rae; Adhikari, Ashok; K C, Man Bahadur",Postgrad. med. j,,136

Among animal-derived products, equine formulations are still the cornerstone therapy for treating envenomations due to animal bites and stings. Therefore, drawing upon decades of experience in manufacturing snake antivenom, we developed and preclinically evaluated two anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal equine formulations as potential alternative therapy for COVID-19. We immunized two groups of horses with either S1 (anti-S1) or a mixture of S1, N, and SEM mosaic (anti-Mix) viral recombinant proteins. Horses reached a maximum anti-viral antibody level at 7 weeks following priming, and showed no major adverse acute or chronic clinical alterations. Two whole-IgG formulations were prepared via hyperimmune plasma precipitation with caprylic acid and then formulated for parenteral use. Both preparations had similar physicochemical and microbiological quality and showed ELISA immunoreactivity towards S1 protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD). The anti-Mix formulation also presented immunoreactivity against N protein. Due to high anti-S1 and anti-RBD antibody content, final products exhibited high in vitro neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 80 times higher than a pool of human convalescent plasma. Pre-clinical quality profiles were similar among both products, but clinical efficacy and safety must be tested in clinical trials. The technological strategy we describe here can be adapted by other producers, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.","León, Guillermo; Herrera, María; Vargas, Mariángela; Arguedas, Mauricio; Sánchez, Andrés; Segura, Álvaro; Gómez, Aarón; Solano, Gabriela; Corrales-Aguilar, Eugenia; Risner, Kenneth; Narayanan, Aarthi; Bailey, Charles; Villalta, Mauren; Hernández, Andrés; Sánchez, Adriana; Cordero, Daniel; Solano, Daniela; Durán, Gina; Segura, Eduardo; Cerdas, Maykel; Umaña, Deibid; Moscoso, Edwin; Estrada, Ricardo; Gutiérrez, Jairo; Méndez, Marcos; Castillo, Ana Cecilia; Sánchez, Laura; Sánchez, Ronald; Gutiérrez, José María; Díaz, Cecilia; Alape, Alberto",Sci Rep,,136
381864,"Palliative care challenges and strategies for the management amid COVID-19 pandemic in India: Perspectives of palliative care nurses, cancer patients, and caregivers",2020,"Older adults have gained great media attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they were believed to be vulnerable to the novel virus based on clinical data and epidemiological evidence. The high volume of media coverage played an important role in calling for improved public health services for the older population. Nevertheless, problematic media representations of older people might evoke or amplify ageism during the pandemic. Therefore, drawing on empirical data collected from five mainstream Chinese media outlets between January 3 and May 3, 2020, this study examined how the media constructed the vulnerability of older adults and its underlying ageist thinking during the pandemic. The findings showed that the media had clear preferences in constructing older people as passive recipients while seeking resources from families, public institutions and governments at various levels to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, the media adopted a biomedical-centred framework presenting older people as a homogenous group that was vulnerable to the pandemic. In addition, we found that the media representations of older adults intensified the dichotomised relationship between the young and the old, causing the younger generations to perceive older people as a 'threat' to public health. Moving beyond the Chinese case, this article appeals to the media to be socially responsible by avoiding the stereotyping of the older population and uniting the whole society to combat COVID-19. The findings of this study will help raise awareness among policymakers and care service providers, which is crucial to eliminating ageist attitudes across society and to further allowing the values of older individuals to be fully recognised.","Zhang, Jingjing; Liu, Xiaoting",Eur J Ageing,,136

We previously described BD-368-2, a SARS-CoV-2 NAb with high potency; however, its neutralization mechanism is largely unknown. Here, we report the 3.5-Å cryo-EM structure of BD-368-2/trimeric-spike complex, revealing that BD-368-2 fully blocks ACE2 recognition by occupying all three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) simultaneously, regardless of their ""up"" or ""down"" conformations. Also, BD-368-2 treats infected adult hamsters at low dosages and at various administering windows, in contrast to placebo hamsters that manifested severe interstitial pneumonia. Moreover, BD-368-2's epitope completely avoids the common binding site of VH3-53/VH3-66 recurrent NAbs, evidenced by tripartite co-crystal structures with RBDs. Pairing BD-368-2 with a potent recurrent NAb neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus at pM level and rescues mutation-induced neutralization escapes. Together, our results rationalized a new RBD epitope that leads to high neutralization potency and demonstrated BD-368-2's therapeutic potential in treating COVID-19.","Du, Shuo; Cao, Yunlong; Zhu, Qinyu; Yu, Pin; Qi, Feifei; Wang, Guopeng; Du, Xiaoxia; Bao, Linlin; Deng, Wei; Zhu, Hua; Liu, Jiangning; Nie, Jianhui; Zheng, Yinghui; Liang, Haoyu; Liu, Ruixue; Gong, Shuran; Xu, Hua; Yisimayi, Ayijiang; Lv, Qi; Wang, Bo; He, Runsheng; Han, Yunlin; Zhao, Wenjie; Bai, Yali; Qu, Yajin; Gao, Xiang; Ji, Chenggong; Wang, Qisheng; Gao, Ning; Huang, Weijin; Wang, Youchun; Xie, X Sunney; Su, Xiao-Dong; Xiao, Junyu; Qin, Chuan",Cell,,136

383170,COVID-19: psychological issues for people with diabetes and health care staff,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is bringing healthcare systems worldwide to the brink of collapse. One reason for this is the rapidly increasing number of new infections. On the other hand, the high sickness rates of doctors and nurses, particularly in ENT medicine, are aggravating the situation. Telemedicine can be a useful tool to reduce the number of physician-patient contacts. This could break infection chains and minimize the risk of infection for physicians. METHODS: To prepare the review, a selective literature search was conducted at www.pubmed.com using the relevant English technical terms for telemedicine and ENT. In addition, research was conducted at www.news.google.com on current developments of the COVID-19 pandemic with the search terms ""telemedicine"" and ""COVID-19."" RESULTS: Telemedicine can be helpful in direct contact with patients as well as in the conciliar support of general practitioners. The available studies show that, on average, more than 50% of medical consultations could be carried out telemedically. Both physicians and patients rate the use of telemedicine positively. Neither image quality nor the handling of the technology are relevant obstacles to a reliable diagnosis. Patients indicated that the telemedical consultation did not last longer than a traditional consultation. Patients also highlighted the faster and better availability of medical care through telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine can make a decisive contribution to coping with the current COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the establishment of telemedicine can help us to become better prepared for future pandemics.","Hagge, Daniel; Knopf, Andreas; Hofauer, Benedikt",HNO,,136

In the current pandemic, a more rapid and high-throughput method is in growing demand. Here, we validated the performance of a new antigen test (LUMIPULSE) based on chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay. A total of 313 nasopharyngeal swabs (82 serial samples from 7 infected patients and 231 individual samples from 4 infected patients and 215 uninfected individuals) were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 with quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and then subjected to LUMIPULSE. We determined the cutoff value for antigen detection using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and compared the performance of the antigen test with that of RT-qPCR. We also compared the viral loads and antigen levels in serial samples from seven infected patients. Using RT-qPCR as the reference, the antigen test exhibited 55.2% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity, with a 91.4% overall agreement rate (286/313). In specimens with > 100 viral copies and between 10 and 100 copies, the antigen test showed 100% and 85% concordance with RT-qPCR, respectively. This concordance declined with lower viral loads. In the serially followed patients, the antigen levels showed a steady decline, along with viral clearance. This gradual decline was in contrast with the abrupt positive-to-negative and negative-to-positive status changes observed with RT-qPCR, particularly in the late phase of infection. In summary, the LUMIPULSE antigen test can rapidly identify SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with moderate to high viral loads and may be helpful for monitoring viral clearance in hospitalized patients.","Hirotsu, Yosuke; Maejima, Makoto; Shibusawa, Masahiro; Nagakubo, Yuki; Hosaka, Kazuhiro; Amemiya, Kenji; Sueki, Hitomi; Hayakawa, Miyoko; Mochizuki, Hitoshi; Tsutsui, Toshiharu; Kakizaki, Yumiko; Miyashita, Yoshihiro; Yagi, Shintaro; Kojima, Satoshi; Omata, Masao",Int J Infect Dis,,136

One can argue that software developers do not implement privacy into the software applications they develop or take GDPR (General Data Protection Law) law into account. Failing to do this, may lead to software applications that open up privacy breaches (e.g. data breach). The GDPR law provides a set of guidelines for developers and organizations on how to protect user data when they are interacting with software applications. Previous research has attempted to investigate what hinders developers from embedding privacy into software systems. However, there has been no detailed investigation on why they cannot develop privacy-preserving systems taking GDPR into consideration, which is imperative to develop software applications that preserve privacy. Therefore, this paper investigates the issues that hinder software developers from implementing software applications taking GDPR law on-board.

In the UK, it has led to sharp falls in labour demand in many sectors of the economy and to initial acute labour shortages in other sectors. Much more than in a typical downturn, the current crisis is not simply a general slowdown in economic activity but also a radical short-term shift in the mix of economic activities - of which an unknown, but possibly significant, amount will be persistent. The initial policy response has focused on cushioning the blow to families' finances and allowing the majority of workers and firms to resume their original activities once the crisis subsides. These are crucial priorities. But there should also be a focus on reallocating some workers, either temporarily if working in shut-down sectors or permanently by facilitating transitions to sectors and jobs offering better prospects and facing labour shortages. The phasing-out of the furlough subsidies, which is projected to happen in Autumn 2020, brings this into even sharper focus since the alternative for many workers will be unemployment.

In severe COVID-19 cases, an increased level of proinflammatory cytokines has been observed in the bloodstream, forming the so-called ""cytokine storm"". Generally, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor containing pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation intensely induces cytokine production as an inflammatory response to viral infection. Therefore, the NLRP3 inflammasome can be a potential target for the treatment of COVID-19. Hence, this review first introduces the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation pathway. Second, we review the cellular/molecular mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., viroporins, ion flux and the complement cascade).

Due its high morbility and mortality, it is necessary to summarize the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients to provide more theoretical basis for future treatment. In the current study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients and explored the risk factors for the severity of illness. A total of 101 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Leishenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) was classified into three sub-types: moderate (n = 47), severe (n = 36), and critical (n = 18); their clinical data were collected from the Electronic Medical Record. We showed that among the 101 COVID-19 patients, the median age was 62 years (IQR 51-74); 50 (49.5%) patients were accompanied by hypertension, while 25 (24.8%) and 22 (21.8%) patients suffered from diabetes and heart diseases, respectively, with complications. All patients were from Wuhan who had a definite history of exposure to the epidemic area. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that older age, diabetes, chronic liver disease, percentage of neutrophils (N%) > 75%, CRP > 4 mg/L, D-dimer > 0.55 mg/L, IL-2R > 710 U/mL, IL-8 > 62 pg/mL, and IL-10 > 9.1 pg/mL were independent variables associated with severe COVID-19. In conclusion, we have identified the independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, including older age, diabetes, chronic liver disease, higher levels of N%, CRP, D-dimer, IL-2R, IL-8, and IL-10, providing evidence for more accurate risk prediction.","Liu, Xue-Qing; Xue, Shan; Xu, Jia-Bo; Ge, Heng; Mao, Qing; Xu, Xin-Hui; Jiang, Han-Dong",Acta pharmacol.

390389,Food Security and COVID-19 in Africa: Implications and Recommendations,2021,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was identified in December 2019. The symptoms include fever, cough, dyspnea, early symptom of sputum, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is the immediate treatment used for patients with severe cases of COVID-19. Herein, we describe two confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan to explore the role of MSC in the treatment of COVID-19. MSC transplantation increases the immune indicators (including CD4 and lymphocytes) and decreases the inflammation indicators (interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein). High-flow nasal cannula can be used as an initial support strategy for patients with ARDS. With MSC transplantation, the fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2) of the two patients gradually decreased while the oxygen saturation (SaO2) and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) improved. Additionally, the patients' chest computed tomography showed that bilateral lung exudate lesions were adsorbed after MSC infusion. Results indicated that MSC transplantation provides clinical data on the treatment of COVID-19 and may serve as an alternative method for treating COVID-19, particularly in patients with ARDS.","Tang, Lingling; Jiang, Yingan; Zhu, Mengfei; Chen, Lijun; Zhou, Xiaoyang; Zhou, Chenliang; Ye, Peng; Chen, Xiaobei; Wang, Baohong; Xu, Zhenyu; Zhang, Qiang; Xu, Xiaowei; Gao, Hainv; Wu, Xiaojun; Li, Dong; Jiang, Wanli; Qu, Jingjing; Xiang, Charlie; Li, Lanjuan",Front Med,,136

Unfortunately, Hemple proposed the Raven Paradox. Then, Carnap used the increment of logical probability as the confirmation measure. So far, many confirmation measures have been proposed. Measure F proposed by Kemeny and Oppenheim among them possesses symmetries and asymmetries proposed by Elles and Fitelson, monotonicity proposed by Greco et al., and normalizing property suggested by many researchers. Based on the semantic information theory, a measure b* similar to F is derived from the medical test. Like the likelihood ratio, measures b* and F can only indicate the quality of channels or the testing means instead of the quality of probability predictions. Furthermore, it is still not easy to use b*, F, or another measure to clarify the Raven Paradox. For this reason, measure c* similar to the correct rate is derived. Measure c* supports the Nicod Criterion and undermines the Equivalence Condition, and hence, can be used to eliminate the Raven Paradox. An example indicates that measures F and b* are helpful for diagnosing the infection of Novel Coronavirus, whereas most popular confirmation measures are not. Another example reveals that all popular confirmation measures cannot be used to explain that a black raven can confirm ""Ravens are black"" more strongly than a piece of chalk. Measures F, b*, and c* indicate that the existence of fewer counterexamples is more important than more positive examples' existence, and hence, are compatible with Popper's falsification thought.","Lu, Chenguang",,,136

395547,Prescribing of Opioid Analgesics and Buprenorphine for Opioid Use Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BackgroundTo counter the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA vaccines, namely tozinameran and elasomeran, have been authorized in several countries. These next generation vaccines have shown high efficacy against COVID-19 and demonstrated a favorable safety profile. As widespread vaccinations efforts are taking place, incidents of myocarditis and pericarditis cases following vaccination have been reported. This safety signal has been recently confirmed by the European Medicine Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This study aimed to investigate and analyze this safety signal using a dual pharmacovigilance database analysis. MethodsThis is as an observational study of reports of inflammatory heart reactions associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines reported in the World Health Organizations global individual case safety report database (up to June 30th 2021), and in the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS, up to May 21st 2021). Cases were described, and disproportionality analyses using reporting odds-ratios (ROR) and their 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were performed to assess relative risk of reporting according to patient sex and age. ResultsAt a global scale, the inflammatory heart reactions most frequently reported were myocarditis (1241, 55%) and pericarditis (851, 37%), the majority requiring hospitalization (n=796 (64%)). Overall, patients were young (median age 33 [21-54] years). The main age group was 18-29 years old (704, 31%), and mostly males (1555, 68%). Pericarditis onset was delayed compared to myocarditis with a median time to onset of 8 [3-21] vs. 3 [2-6] days, respectively (p=0.001). Regarding myocarditis, an important disproportionate reporting in males (ROR, 9.4 [8.3-10.6]) as well as in adolescents (ROR, 22.3 [19.2-25.9]) and 18-29 years old (ROR, 6.6 [5.9-7.5]) compared to older patients were observed. ConclusionsThe inflammatory heart reactions, namely myocarditis and pericarditis, have been reported world-wide shortly following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. An important disproportionate reporting among adolescents and young adults, particularly in males, was observed especially for myocarditis. Guidelines must take this specific risk into account and to optimize vaccination protocols according to sex and age. While the substantial benefits of COVID-19 vaccination still prevail over risks, clinicians and the public should be aware of these reactions and seek appropriate medical attention.","Chouchana, Laurent; Blet, Alice; Al-Khalaf, Mohammad; Kafil, Tahir S; Nair, Girish; Robblee, James; Drici, Milou-Daniel; Valnet-Rabier, Marie-Blanche; Micallef, Joelle; Salvo, Francesco; Treluyer, Jean-Marc; Liu, Peter",,,136

(-)-Epicatechin and taxifolin are two flavonoids with notable antihypertensive effects and multiple beneficial actions in the cardiovascular system, but they also possess antiviral effects, which may be of particular importance in the ongoing pandemic situation. Thus, this review is focused on the current knowledge of (-)-epicatechin as well as (+)-taxifolin and/or (-)-taxifolin-modified biological action and underlining molecular mechanisms determined in preclinical studies, which are relevant not only to the treatment of hypertension per se but may provide additional antiviral benefits that could be relevant to the treatment of hypertensive subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bernatova, Iveta; Liskova, Silvia",,,136

The data was collected in two subsequent semesters of the L&T course, with different PBL scenarios and students, gathering quantitative and qualitative data. It was demonstrated that aligned with the theory on PBL, the majority of the students, over 91%, appreciated the benefits of the PBL-based practices in all course dimensions, with a strong perception of L&T teaching and learning improvements. Researchers and faculty involved in university teaching and learning can use PBL detailed practices, including problem scenarios and theoretical framework to design their own PBL classes to improve student learning and can also use the questionnaire structure and statistical tests for adoption in future implementations.

However, with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia, disruptions in routine health care pose a significant risk in reversing the gains made in neonatal mortality reduction. METHODS: Using the World Health Organization's health systems building blocks framework we examined the mechanisms by which the pandemic may impact neonatal health. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken by the government to control its spread could indirectly set back the gains made in neonatal mortality reduction in Ethiopia by weakening the health system building blocks. On the other hand, by exposing longstanding issues in the health system, the pandemic has pressed health sector stakeholders to urgently test innovative approaches to maintain delivery of essential health care. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia strike a right balance between the control of the pandemic and ensuring provision of essential neonatal health services. As the pandemic continues to spread in the country, the government should avoid verticalization of pandemic response efforts and adopt a diagonal investment approach to effectively respond to the pandemic as well as build health system resilience to maintain the gains made in the neonatal health.","Estifanos, Abiy Seifu; Kazmi, Kescha; Morris, Shaun K",Matern Child Health J,,136

In this COVID pandemic, the decision to continue elective cancer surgeries, and their subsequent outcomes, are sparsely reported from hotspots. METHODS: A prospective database of the Department of Surgical Oncology was analysed from March 23rd to April 30th, 2020. FINDINGS: Four hundred ninety-four elective surgeries were performed (377 untested and 117 tested for Covid 19 before surgery). Median age was 48 years with 13% (n = 64) above the age of 60 years. Sixty-eight percent patients were American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) grade I. As per surgical complexity grading, 71 (14·4%) cases were lower grade (I-III) and 423 (85.6%) were higher grade complex surgeries (IV - VI).Clavien-Dindo &#8805; grade III complications were 5.6% (n = 28) and there were no postoperative deaths. Patients >60 years documented 9.3% major complications compared to 5.2% in <60 years (P = 0.169). The median hospital stay was 1 to 9 days across specialties.Postoperatively, 26 patients were tested for COVID 19 and 6 tested positive. They all had higher grade surgeries but none required escalated or intensive care treatment related to COVID infection. INTERPRETATION: A combination of scientific and administrative rationale contributed to favorable outcomes after major elective cancer surgeries. These results support the continuation of elective major cancer surgery in regions with Covid 19 trends similar to India.","Shrikhande, Shailesh V; Pai, Prathmesh S; Bhandare, Manish S; Bakshi, Ganesh; Chaukar, Devendra A; Chaturvedi, Pankaj; Goel, Mahesh; Gulia, Ashish; Qureshi, Sajid S; Maheshwari, Amita; Moiyadi, Aliasgar; Nair, Sudhir; Nair, Nita S; Karimundackal, George; Saklani, Avanish P; Shankhadhar, Vinay K; Parmar, Vani; Divatia, Jigeeshu V; Pramesh, C S; Puri, Ajay; Badwe, Rajendra A",Ann. surg,,136

We present a core methodology to assist governments in this task, presenting a case for appropriate actions at each stage of recovery based on scientific data and analysis. Specifically, 3 types of data are needed: data on the spread of disease should be analyzed alongside data on the overall health of the population and data on infrastructure-for example, the capacity of health systems. Local circumstances will produce different needs and present different setbacks, and governments may need to reinstate as well as relax restrictions. Transparent, defensible analysis can assist in making these decisions and communicating them to the public. In the absence of a widely administered vaccine, analysis remains one of our most important tools in addressing the coronavirus pandemic.","Trump, Benjamin D; Bridges, Todd S; Cegan, Jeffrey C; Cibulsky, Susan M; Greer, Scott L; Jarman, Holly; Lafferty, Brandon J; Surette, Melissa A; Linkov, Igor",Health Secur,,136

410193,3D-printed N95 equivalent for personal protective equipment shortages: The Kansas City Mask,2020,"BACKGROUND: Low free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels are related to a poor prognosis deterioration in patients with COVID-19 presenting with non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTI). This study was designed to explore whether free thyroxin (FT4) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels affected the mortality of patients with COVID-19 presenting with NTI. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 complicated with NTI who were treated at our hospital were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into low TSH and normal TSH groups, as well as low and normal-high FT4 group, according to the reference range of TSH or FT4 levels. The 90-day mortality and critical illness rates were compared among patients with low and normal TSH levels, as well as among patients with low FT4 levels and normal-high FT4 levels; in addition, differences in demographic and laboratory data were compared. A Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the associations of TSH and FT4 levels with mortality. RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients with low FT3 levels and without a history of thyroid disease were included, 68% of whom had normal FT4 and TSH levels. Critical illness rates (74.07% VS 37.40%, P = 0.001) and mortality rates (51.85% VS 22.76%, P = 0.002) were significantly higher in the low TSH group than in the normal TSH group. Although no significant difference in the critical illness rate was found (P = 0.296), the mortality rate was significantly higher in the low FT4 group (P = 0.038). Low TSH levels were independently related to 90-day mortality (hazard ratio = 2.78, 95% CI:1.42-5.552, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Low FT4 and TSH concentrations were associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 presenting with NTI; moreover, low TSH levels were an independent risk factor for mortality in these patients.","Gong, Jing; Wang, Ding-Kun; Dong, Hui; Xia, Qing-Song; Huang, Zhao-Yi; Zhao, Yan; Chen, Xing; Yuan, Fen; Li, Jing-Bin; Lu, Fu-Er",BMC Endocr Disord,,136

413063,Mental health in the era of COVID-19: prevalence of psychiatric disorders in a cohort of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during the social distancing,2020,"Background: Nine COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease, 2019) cases were observed in one community in Guangzhou. All the cases lived in three vertically aligned units of one building sharing the same piping system, which provided one unique opportunity to examine the transmission mode of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We interviewed the cases on the history of travelling and close contact with the index patients. Respiratory samples from all the cases were collected for viral phylogenetic analyses. A simulation experiment in the building and a parallel control experiment in a similar building were then conducted to investigate the possibility of transmission through air. Results: Index patients living in Apartment 15-b had a travelling history in Wuhan, and four cases who lived in Apartment 25-b and 27-b were subsequently diagnosed. Phylogenetic analyses showed that virus of all the patients were from the same strain of the virus. No close contacts between the index cases and other families indicated that the transmission might not occur through droplet and close contacts. Airflow detection and simulation experiment revealed that flushing the toilets could increase the speed of airflow in the pipes and transmitted the airflow from Apartment 15-b to 25-b and 27-b. Reduced exhaust flow rates in the infected building might have contributed to the outbreak. Conclusions: The outbreak of COVID-19 in this community could be largely explained by the transmission through air, and future efforts to prevent the infection should take the possibility of transmission through air into consideration. A disconnected drain pipe and exhaust pipe for toilet should be considered in the architectural design to help prevent possible virus spreading through the air.","Lin, Guozhen; Zhang, Shiyu; Zhong, Yi; Zhang, Lin; Ai, Siqi; Li, Kuibiao; Su, Wenzhe; Cao, Lan; Zhao, Yuteng; Tian, Fei; Li, Jinrong; Wu, Yinglin; Guo, Chongshan; Peng, Rongfei; Wu, Xinwei; Gan, Pingsheng; Zhu, Wei; Lin, Hualiang; Zhang, Zhoubin",Atmos Environ (1994),,136

The stiffness of the non-crosslinked hydrogen-bonded capsules was found to be proportional to the square of the wall thickness which is in agreement with previous observations on other multilayer capsules and continuum mechanical theory. The found elastic modulus of 610 MPa for low pH (= 2) is typical for a highly stable, glass-like structure similar to electrostatically bound multilayers. At pH > 6, (PMAA) capsules obtained through chemical crosslinking of hydrogen-bonded (PVPON/PMAA) multilayers, or crosslinked (PVPON-co-NH-20/PMAA) capsules showed a sharp hundreds-fold stiffness decrease to â¼1 mN/m which was orders of magnitude lower than those reported earlier for polymeric multilayer systems. pH-Triggered softening was reversible and highly reproducible. Softening of both (PMAA) and (PVPON-co-NH-20/PMAA) crosslinked capsules resulted from increased PMAA ionization, and additional dissociation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds occurred in the case of (PVPON-co-NH-20/PMAA) crosslinked system.","Elsner, Nils; Kozlovskaya, Veronika; Sukhishvili, Svetlana A; Fery, Andreas",Soft Matter,,136

418995,Response to “how prepared is Africa to face COVID-19?” by Wadoum and Clarke,2020,"INTRODUCTION: IgG immunoassays have been developed and used widely for clinical samples and serosurveys for SARS-CoV2, with most detecting antibodies against the spike/receptor-binding-domain or nucleocapsid. Limited information is available on comparative evaluation of IgG immunoassays against a clinical reference standard, i.e., RT-PCR positivity with >20 days of illness. This study addresses the need for comparing clinical performance of IgG immunoassays with respect to this alternate reference standard. METHODS: We compared the performance of three immunoassays, an in-house RBD assay, and two commercial assays, the Diasorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S1 IgG CLIA which detects antibodies against S1/S2 domains of the Spike protein and the Zydus Kavach assay based on inactivated virus using a well-characterized panel of sera. 379 sera and plasma samples from RTPCR positive individuals >20 days of illness in symptomatic or RT-PCR positivity in asymptomatic individuals and 184 samples collected prior to 2019 were used for assay evaluation. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the assays were 84.7 (95 %CI 80.6-88.1), 82.6 (95 %CI 78.3-86.2) and 75.7 (95 %CI 71.0-79.9) respectively for RBD, LIAISON and Kavach. Kavach and the in-house RBD ELISA showed a specificity of 99.5 % and 100 %, respectively. The RBD and LIAISON (S1/S2) assays showed high agreement (94.7 %; 95 %CI: 92.0, 96.6) and were able to correctly identify more positive sera/plasma than Kavach. CONCLUSION: Independent comparisons support the evaluation of performance characteristics of immunoassays. All three assays are suitable for serosurveillance studies, but in low prevalence sites, estimation of exposure may require adjustment based on our findings.","Chaudhuri, Susmita; Thiruvengadam, Ramachandran; Chattopadhyay, Souvick; Mehdi, Farha; Kshetrapal, Pallavi; Shrivastava, Tripti; Desiraju, Bapu Koundinya; Batra, Gaurav; Kang, Gagandeep; Bhatnagar, Shinjini",J Clin Virol,,136
419047,Pregnant women's knowledge and practice of preventive measures against COVID-19 in a low-resource African setting,2020,"Introduction: The year 2020 will always stand in the shadow of the pandemic triggered by the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). The first three quarter years of 2020 were characterized by an unprecedented reduction of elective inpatient services and a prioritization of intensive care capacity for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This also resulted in clear consequences for the services provided in cardiac surgery. In addition, during the course of the year the personnel in hospitals were confronted with a plethora of amendments in the legal framework conditions. Nevertheless, the modified German diagnosis-related groups (G-DRG) system 2021 was calculated by the Institute for the Remuneration System in Hospitals (InEK). This article describes and assesses the most important amendments of the modified G­DRG system 2021 for cardiac, thoracic and vascular surgery. Methods: Analysis of the relevant diagnoses, procedures and G­DRG structures in the system versions for 2020 and 2021 based on the information published by the InEK and the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM). Results: Expansions of the relevant classification systems for diagnoses (ICD-10-GM 2021) and procedures (OPS 2021) lead to an increase in specific coding of essential interventions and operations in cardiovascular surgery. Within the framework of the adaptation of the G­DRG structures, the condensation of the previous fixed rates for heart transplantation to G­DRG A05Z and devaluation of coronary bypass operations and reconstructive vascular interventions are particularly important. Conclusion: For cardiovascular surgery there are manifold amendments with sometimes substantial repercussions for the case proceeds. Additionally, for many German hospitals the effects of the corona pandemic are not yet finally foreseeable. A further increasingly more urgent influencing factor particularly affecting vascular medicine is the increasing pressure to promote outpatient treatment. In this respect, the catalogue for outpatient operations in hospitals (AOP), which is expected in 2022 and will presumably be much expanded, will once again clearly increase the enforcement of outpatient performance of services that were previously performed as inpatient treatment.","Franz, Dominik; Wenke, Andreas; Roeder, Norbert",Z Herz Thorax Gefasschir,,136
419344,Association of Intensive Care Unit Patient Load and Demand With Mortality Rates in US Department of Veterans Affairs Hospitals During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Protein kinases are a large class of enzymes with numerous biological roles and many have been implicated in a vast array of diseases, including cancer and the novel coronavirus infection COVID-19. Thus, the development of chemical probes to selectively target each kinase is of great interest. Inhibition of protein kinases with ATP-competitive inhibitors has historically been the most widely used method. However, due to the highly conserved structures of ATP-sites, the identification of truly selective chemical probes is challenging. In this review, we use the Ser/Thr kinase CK2 as an example to highlight the historical challenges in effective and selective chemical probe development, alongside recent advances in the field and alternative strategies aiming to overcome these problems. The methods utilised for CK2 can be applied to an array of protein kinases to aid in the discovery of chemical probes to further understand each kinase's biology, with wide-reaching implications for drug development.","Atkinson, Eleanor L; Iegre, Jessica; Brear, Paul D; Zhabina, Elizabeth A; Hyvönen, Marko; Spring, David R",Molecules (Basel),,136

Thus, the recent decision by governors of states in northern Nigeria to deport Almajirai (itinerant Islamic school pupils) from their states as part of efforts to contain COVID-19 transmission is likely to have a serious backlash. With hundreds of Almajirai testing positive to COVID-19, and millions of others untested, they constitute ubiquitous nodes of transmission. Their deportation has created multiple emigration channels that constitute prospective feeders to covert community transmission. This viewpoint examines this trend within the context of Nigeria's current [in]capacity to manage the spread of COVID-19 and concludes that greater risks seem to lie ahead unless the government takes stringent containment measures.","Nwozor, Agaptus; Okolie, Charles; Okidu, Onjefu; Oshewolo, Segun",Ann Glob Health,,136

Although often asymptomatic, a relevant percentage of affected people can develop severe pneumonia. Initial evidence suggests that dysregulation of the immune response could contribute to the pathogenesis, as previously demonstrated for SARS-CoV. The presence of genome composition features involved in delaying viral recognition is herein investigated for human coronaviruses (HCoVs), with a special emphasis on SARS-CoV-2. A broad collection of HCoVs polyprotein, envelope, matrix, nucleocapsid and spike coding sequences was downloaded and several statistics representative of genome composition and codon bias were investigated. A model able to evaluate and test the presence of a significant under- or over-representation of dinucleotide pairs while accounting for the underlying codon bias and protein sequence was also implemented. The study revealed the significant under-representation of CpG dinucleotide pair in all HcoV, but especially in SARS-CoV and even more in SARS-CoV-2. The presence of forces acting to minimize CpG content was confirmed by relative synonymous codon usage pattern. Codons containing the CpG pair were severely under-represented, primarily in the polyprotein and spike coding sequences of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, a significant under-representation of the TpA pair was observed in the N and S region of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Increasing experimental evidence has proven that CpG and TpA are targeted by innate antiviral host defences, contributing both to RNA degradation and RIG-1 mediated interferon production. The low content of these dinucleotides could contribute to a delayed interferon production, dysregulated immune response, higher viral replication and poor outcome. Significantly, the RIG-1 signalling pathway was proven to be defective in elderlies, suggesting a likely interaction between limited viral recognition and lower responsiveness in interferon production that could justify the higher disease severity and mortality in older patients.","Franzo, Giovanni",Sci Rep,,136

The aim of this study is to explore how older people in rural Nigeria may be digitally excluded and its impact during the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative data was obtained from 11 older people using interviews. The collected data was then transcribed and analyzed thematically. Findings show that older people in rural Nigeria were digitally excluded. However, the older people argued that the digital exclusion is not the reason for their social isolation and loneliness. The study concluded by suggesting how caregivers and social workers can assist rural older people through activity schedule and radio programs designed for older people.","Ekoh, Prince Chiagozie; George, Elizabeth Onyedikachi; Ezulike, Chigozie Donatus",J Gerontol Soc Work,,136

OBJECTIVE: To study the vulnerability of patients with MGUS during the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed the local management of MGUS patients and their clinical outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective chart reviews were performed for all patients with MGUS seen at a university medical center clinic (2014-2020). RESULTS: A total of 228 MGUS patients were included;211 patients are alive, 7 patients died before the pandemic, and 10 patients died since the pandemic declaration. The mean age and the overall survival (OS) of the patients who died before versus during the pandemic were 83.0 versus 75.2 years, p = 0.4, and OS 40.6 versus 53.2 months, p = 0.3, respectively. One patient died of COVID-19. Nine patients had venous thromboembolisms (VTE), all of which occurred before the pandemic onset.

The Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered (SEIR) models are among the widely used approaches to study the further progression of the pandemic. However, finding such model parameters remains a difficult task, especially in small geographical areas where details of the initial compartments and the model parameters deviates from global distributions. The main result of our paper is a meta-heuristic approach to find SEIR model parameters that best explains the infected time series. Our approach, allows studying different future scenarios considering not only the most likely future, but a set of possible SEIR parameters that explains current epidemic trends. We show that there are several possible parameters sets of such models able to explain current epidemic trends and by studding them is possible to obtain insights into the future possible outcomes.","Rojas-Delgado, J.; Pupo-Merino, M.; Gulin-Gonzalez, J.",Computacion Y Sistemas,,136

The current cluster randomized controlled trial examines the effects of mindfulness intervention vs. active control program (i.e., relaxation) focusing on the main EFs (i.e., working memory, response inhibition, cognitive processing, cognitive flexibility and verbal fluency). A total of 131 students from 6th grade and 8th grade (median age 12 and 15) from four comprehensive schools participated. The schools were to equal shares randomized to intervention and active control groups, i.e., groups who underwent a 9-week mindfulness practice or relaxation program, respectively. Participants completed a cognitive test-package at baseline/pre-intervention, post-intervention at 9 weeks and follow-up at 6 months. Both intervention and active relaxation-based control groups improved on a majority of EF measures at both 9 weeks and 6 months. There was no significant difference between the mindfulness intervention group and the active control program in EFs. The current study suggests that mindfulness intervention and active control program do not differ in their effects to EFs, although both may have positive outcomes. Further research with both active and inactive control groups is needed to map the potential benefits of similar programs for cognitive functioning.","Lassander, Maarit; Hintsanen, Mirka; Suominen, Sakari; Mullola, Sari; Fagerlund, Åse; Vahlberg, Tero; Volanen, Salla-Maarit",Dev Neuropsychol,,136

DESIGN: An observational descriptive study which included hospitalised suspected, or probable cases of hopitalised COVID-19 patients, conducted in Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Hospital, Ciputra Hospital, Mitra Keluarga Depok Hospital and Mitra Keluarga Kelapa Gading Hospital, Indonesia. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were obtained. Nasopharyngeal and anal swabs specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. RESULTS: We analysed 136 subjects as part of this study. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 manifesation in this study was typical of hospitalised patients, with 25% classified as mild cases, 14.7% in severe condition and 12.5% of subjects classified as having acute respiratory distress syndrome. When compared with nasopharyngeal swab as the standard specimen for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen, the sensitivity and specificity of the anal swab was 36.7% and 93.8%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive value were 97.8% and 16.5 %, respectively. The performance of the anal swab remained similar when only the subgroup of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms (n=92, 67.6%) was analysed (sensitivity 40% and specificity 91.7%). Out of all the subjects included in analysis, 67.6% had gastrointestinal symptoms. Similarly, 73.3% of patients in the anal swab-positive group had gastrointestinal symptoms. The two most common gastrointestinal symptoms in the subjects' population were nausea and anorexia. CONCLUSION: Anal swab specimen has low sensitivity (36.7%) but high specificity (93.8%) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigen by RT-PCR. Only one additional positive result was found by anal swab among the nasopharyngeal swab-negative group. Anal swab may not be needed as an additional test at the beginning of a patient's diagnostic investigation and nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR remains as the standard diagnostic test for COVID-19.","Abdullah, Murdani; Sudrajat, Dedy Gunawanjati; Muzellina, Virly Nanda; Kurniawan, Juferdy; Rizka, Aulia; Utari, Amanda Pitarini; Pribadi, Rabbinu Rangga; Idrus, Muhammad Firhat; Yusra, Yusra; Meilany, Sofy; Surandy, Andry; Shatri, Hamzah; Rinaldi, Ikhwan; Pitoyo, Ceva Wicaksono; Renaldi, Kaka",,,136

442732,Attitudes and collateral psychological effects of COVID-19 in pregnant women in Colombia,2020,"Physical performance measures, including cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPXT), are widely used in geriatric practice and aging research. Theoretically, research participants and study personnel could get infected in the closed environment of the exercise laboratory by contact with respiratory droplets from an infected person, by breathing virus-laden aerosols, or by touching fomites. Older adults are at increased risk of developing more severe disease and of dying from SARS-CoV-2 infection. This special article offers guidance - informed by a synthesis of scientific data and recommendations of the CDC and WHO, - on procedures that can be implemented in exercise laboratories to minimize risk of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections. Most tests of physical function (e.g., gait speed, Short Physical Performance Battery) are not aerosol-generating and are associated with only a small increase in minute ventilation; in contrast, CPXT markedly increases minute ventilation and is potentially aerosol-generating. Researchers should evaluate the benefit-to-risk ratio of information gained from the laboratory assessment versus the risk of SARS-CoV2 infection. Risk mitigation strategies described here fall into four categories: personal hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment; standardized screening; reconfiguration of laboratory space; and optimization of laboratory ventilation. The proposed safety measures are not intended to replace institutional policy, state or federal guidelines; they may not apply to all settings and are expected to evolve as more definitive information becomes available. These practical measures to maximize protection against SARS-CoV2 infection can help maximize participant and staff safety, reduce anxiety, and facilitate protocol adherence, and study integrity.

445403,Both younger and elderly patients in pain are willing to undergo knee replacement despite the COVID-19 pandemic: a study on surgical waiting lists,2021,"The 21st century brought many changes to the world. From witnessing a technological boom and awareness about the environment to renewable energy and conscious use of natural resources, the current century had offered a lot in the previous two decades. However, the question of natural resources being a curse or a blessing to the natural resource-producing economies is still unanswered and gathers many scholars' attention. The current study investigates the volatility of natural resources, oil and gold, and studies the impact of volatility in natural resource prices for resource-producing economies. The global market for crude oil has experienced significant downturns during the last two decades, the financial crisis of 2008 and the Covid 19 crisis of 2020, for instance. Compared to that, the global gold market has experienced relatively less impactful downturns during the same period. We explore how the volatility in oil and gold prices impact the growth of the resource-producing economies. The study is conducted on the top oil-producing countries and the top gold-producing countries on data from 2000 to 2020. The study finds that in the long run, the volatility in both oil and gold markets could be detrimental to the economic growth as measured by the GDP for the resource-producing economies. Our research also shows that the impact of the volatility in prices on the growth of economies is not consistent for all resource-producing economies in the short-term using PMG/ARDL methodology. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Guan, L.; Zhang, W.

445487,Delay in head and neck cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on health outcomes,2020,"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a widespread impact on societies across the globe. As part of the effort to control transmission in the United States, many businesses either closed or instituted nonpharmaceutical control measures and allowed only essential workers on-site. During summer and fall of 2020, employers began formulating ""return to work"" strategies designed to mitigate the risk of transmission among employees. On a population level, several countries implemented national testing and surveillance strategies that proved effective in mitigating citizen-to-citizen transmission and contributed to suppressing COVID-19. A crucial component of many such strategies is population-based testing to identify and engage individuals with asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection, which also is relevant to return-to-work strategies. The authors describe an approach that multisite employers might use to help mitigate transmission of COVID-19 in the workplace. This approach leverages a bioinformatics platform informed by real-time PCR test data at the county and subcounty (eg, Public Use Microdata Area) level, allowing for population-based testing to be selectively targeted for employees in geographies with elevated SARS-CoV-2 positivity. A ""Command Center"" application integrates data from multiple sources (eg, local infection trends, employee symptom diaries, Bluetooth thermometers) in real time, which can be used to inform decisions regarding surveillance and employee self-isolation or quarantine; a mobile phone-based application provides for rapid, secure communication with employees. This overview is based on peer-reviewed literature and the early experience of a large employer with implementing bioinformatics tools to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the workplace.","Plantes, Peter J; Fragala, Maren S; Clarke, Charles; Goldberg, Zachary N; Radcliff, Jeff; Goldberg, Steven E",Popul Health Manag,,136

448136,Letter to the Editor: Premorbid Frailty is a better Prognostic Indicator than Age in Oldest-old Hospitalized with COVID-19,2021,"We consider a vaccination game that results with the introduction of premature and possibly scarce vaccines introduced in a desperate bid to combat the otherwise ravaging deadly pandemic. The response of unsure agents amid many uncertainties makes this game completely different from the previous studies. We construct a framework that combines SIS epidemic model with a variety of dynamic behavioral vaccination responses and demographic aspects. The response of each agent is influenced by the vaccination hesitancy and urgency, which arise due to their personal belief about efficacy and side-effects of the vaccine, disease characteristics, and relevant reported information (e.g., side-effects, disease statistics etc.). Based on such aspects, we identify the responses that are stable against static mutations. By analysing the attractors of the resulting ODEs, we observe interesting patterns in the limiting state of the system under evolutionary stable (ES) strategies, as a function of various defining parameters. There are responses for which the disease is eradicated completely (at limiting state), but none are stable against mutations. Also, vaccination abundance results in higher infected fractions at ES limiting state, irrespective of the disease death rate.","Singh, Vartika; Agarwal, Khushboo; Shubham,; Kavitha, Veeraruna",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06008v1.pdf,136

So far, no successful specific treatment has been found for this disease. As has been reported, most of non-survivor patients with COVID-19 (70%) had septic shock which was significantly higher than survived ones. Although the exact pathophysiology of septic shock in these patients is still unclear, it seems to be possible that part of it would be due to the administration of empiric antibiotics with inflammatory properties especially in the absence of bacterial infection. Herein, we have reviewed possible molecular pathways of septic shock in the patients who have received antibiotics with inflammatory properties which mainly is release of interleukin 1ß (IL-1ß), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF- &#945;) through different routes. Altogether, we highly recommend clinicians to look after those antibiotics with anti-inflammatory activity for both empiric antibiotic therapy and reducing the inflammation to prevent septic shock in patients with diagnosed COVID-19.","Hantoushzadeh, Sedigheh; Norooznezhad, Amir Hossein",Arch Med Res,,136

Herein we used an integrated approach of LC-MS-and GC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics to analyze plasma metabolic characteristics in men and women with non-severe COVID-19 at both acute period and 30 days after discharge. The results demonstrate that metabolic alterations in plasma of COVID-19 patients during the recovery and rehabilitation process were presented in a sex specific manner. Overall, the levels of most metabolites were increased in COVID-19 patients after the cure relative to acute period. The major plasma metabolic changes were identified including fatty acids in men and glycerophosphocholines and carbohydrates in women. In addition, we found that women had shorter length of hospitalization than men and metabolic characteristics may contribute to predict the duration from positive to negative in non-severe COVID-19 patients. Collectively, this study shed light on sex-specific metabolic shifts in non-severe COVID-19 patients during the recovery process, suggesting a sex bias in prognostic and therapeutic evaluations based on metabolic profiling.","Zheng, Hong; Jin, Shengwei; Li, Ting; Ying, Weiyang; Ying, Binyu; Chen, Dong; Ning, Jie; Zheng, Chanfan; Li, Yuping; Li, Chen; Chen, Chengshui; Li, Xiaokun; Gao, Hongchang",,,136

DATA SOURCES: Databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsychINFO and OTseeker) were searched (09.10.2020) with no date or language restrictions. Grey literature databases, clinical trial registries and references lists of key papers were also searched. REVIEW METHODS: Eligible randomised controlled trials included people using treatments for scarring following skin wounds, interventions that may improve adherence, and outcomes measuring adherence. Risk of bias (selection, performance, detection, attrition, reporting) and certainty of evidence (inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, publication bias) were assessed. RESULTS: Four randomised trials were included with 224 participants (17 children) with burn scars. Interventions involved educational (three trials) or technology-based components (four trials) and ranged in length from two weeks to six months. All four trials reported greater adherence rates in the intervention group compared with standard practice [standardised mean difference = 1.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.91-2.08); 2.01 (95% CI 1.05-2.98); odds ratio = 0.28 (95% CI = 0.11-0.69)]. One trial did not report original data. The certainty of evidence was very low. CONCLUSION: Adherence interventions using education or technology for people receiving burn scar treatment may improve adherence. Further studies are needed particularly in children, with a focus on including outcomes of importance to patients (e.g. quality of life) and identifying core components of effective adherence interventions using theoretical frameworks.","Killey, Jessica; Simons, Megan; Tyack, Zephanie",Clin Rehabil,,136

Because SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious due to contamination in the air, there is a high risk of infection in the dental environment which is represents a serious problem for professionals and students (dentistry and dental hygiene). In Italy, since February 23, 2020, the government has suspended all teaching activities of schools and universities. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was administered to the students of the degree courses in Dental Hygiene of the Emilia Romagna Region, one of the most affected regions in Italy. The survey was intended to highlight the practical and emotional consequences of the emergency of COVID-19 on educational activities and in the training of students. RESULTS: The survey was sent to the 150 students enrolled in the universities of Bologna, Ferrara and Modena and Reggio Emilia; 141 of them completed it (94%). Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, several surveys have been proposed to measure the impact of this emergency situation on dental professionals; at present, however, there are still no assessments for dental hygiene degree courses, in particular aimed at assessing the psychological impact on students. CONCLUSIONS: Students consider the dental hygienist as a risky profession, while the risk taken by patients is considered as low. Given the concern reported the students, it would be useful to address the issue of proper assessment of risk during the university training of dental hygienists.","Bellini, Pierantonio; Iani, Cristina; Zucchelli, Giovanni; Franchi, Maurizio; Mattioli, Anna V; Consolo, Ugo",Minerva stomatol,,136

Here we look at how society has responded to the Covid-19 emergency and compare it with the response to the climate change emergency, the latter based on our experience of a Royal Society of Edinburgh Inquiry on climate change published nearly ten years ago (RSE, 2011). With reference to Covid-19, civil society's response to the lockdown showed the power of clear political leadership and also the willingness of people to work together. On the negative side, the UK national test and trace system struggled because of a disconnect between national and regional activities. In our climate change report, we identified similar organisational barriers that were impeding a move towards a low-carbon future, especially the lack of responsibilities and powers at a city regional scale. If Scotland is to reduce emissions seriously, the focus needs to be on transport (30% of emissions), heating and agriculture. Without more responsibility and power at a city regional scale, Scotland will not achieve its emissions targets.","Sugden, D.; Werritty, A.; Webb, J.; Kerr, A.",Scottish Geographical Journal,,136

However, advanced, homebound individuals may have less access to vaccinations. In light of COVID-19, understanding barriers to vaccination in PD may inform strategies to increase vaccine uptake. OBJECTIVE: To identify influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates, including barriers and facilitators to vaccination, among homebound and ambulatory individuals with PD and related disorders. METHODS: Cross-sectional US-based study among individuals with PD, agedâ>â65 years, stratified as homebound or ambulatory. Participants completed semi-structured interviews on vaccination rates and barriers, and healthcare utilization. RESULTS: Among 143 participants, 9.8% had missed all influenza vaccinations in the past 5 years, and 32.2% lacked any pneumococcal vaccination, with no between-group differences. Homebound participants (nâ=â41) reported difficulty traveling to clinic (pâ<â0.01) as a vaccination barrier, and despite similar outpatient visit frequencies, had more frequent emergency department visits (31.7% vs. 9.8%, pâ<â0.01) and hospitalizations (14.6% vs. 2.9%, pâ=â0.03). Vaccine hesitancy was reported in 35% of participants, vaccine refusal in 19%, and 13.3% reported unvaccinated household members, with no between-group differences. Nearly 13% thought providers recommended against vaccines for PD patients, and 31.5% were unsure of vaccine recommendations in PD. CONCLUSION: Among a sample of homebound and ambulatory people with PD, many lack age-appropriate immunizations despite ample healthcare utilization. Many participants were unsure whether healthcare providers recommend vaccinations for people with PD. In light of COVID-19, neurologist reinforcement that vaccinations are indicated, safe, and recommended may be beneficial.","Phanhdone, Tiffany; Drummond, Patrick; Meisel, Talia; Friede, Naomi; Di Rocco, Alessandro; Chodosh, Joshua; Fleisher, Jori",Journal of Parkinson&#039;s disease (Online),,136

As members of the journal's editorial board, we are strongly supportive of open debate in science, which is essential even on highly contentious issues. However, we must also be thorough in our examination of the facts and open to changing our minds when new information arises. In this commentary, we document several important errors in the manuscript by Dr. Risch, review the literature he presented and demonstrate why it is not of sufficient quality to support scale up of HCQ+AZ, and then discuss the literature that has been generated since his publication, which also does not support use of this therapy. Unfortunately, the current scientific evidence does not support HCQ+AZ as an effective treatment for COVID-19, if it ever did; and even suggests many risks. Continuing to push the view that it is an essential treatment in the face of this evidence is irresponsible and harmful to the many people already suffering from infection.","Fox, Matthew P; D039,; Agostino McGowan, Lucy; James, Bryan D; Lessler, Justin; Mehta, Shruti H; Murray, Eleanor J",Am. j. epidemiol,,136

464746,Nurse-led care management models for patients with multimorbidity in hospital settings: a scoping review protocol,2021,"Agricultural land is crucial for the production of food and is, thereby, directly connected to food security. Agriculture is threatened by a multitude of hazards, such as climate change, peak oil, peak soil and peak phosphorus. These hazards call for a more resilient food system that can deliver food security for the global population in the future. In this paper, we analyse the Baltic Sea region’s ten European Union (EU) member states, investigating which trends are to be found in statistics between 2005 to 2016 on the development of agricultural land. In our paper, we analyse these trends of agricultural land by looking at three categories of data: (1) utilised agricultural area, (2) number of farms and (3) agricultural labour input. The results showed a trend that agricultural land is increasingly dominated by large farms, whilst over 1 million predominantly small farms have disappeared, and agricultural-labour input has dropped by more than 26%. These trends point towards a mechanisation of production, where larger and less labour-intensive farms take over production. This could partly be due to the EU common agricultural policy, which tends to favour large farms over small. Further, we argue for the importance of farm-size diversity, and about the dangers to food security that a system that is dominated by large farms possesses. Lastly, we conclude that the concept of resilience needs to be better included in policy development and food-system planning, and that more research needs to be done, analysing how existing agricultural policies impact the parameters studied in this paper.","Ambros, Pontus Granvik Madeleine",Sustainability,,136
465603,"Patients with COVID-19 in 19 ICUs in Wuhan, China: a cross-sectional study",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Therapy of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) involves evolving algorithms that include drugs aimed at reducing disease progression by counteracting two different, but intertwined processes: (i) the damage caused by the virus (with antivirals); (ii) the damage caused by a dysregulated host response (with immunomodulatory agents). AREAS COVERED: Herein, we discuss the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of antiviral agents employed over the past months for the treatment of COVID-19, and the reasons to be considered for antiviral selection. EXPERT OPINION: The available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) currently discourages the use of lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, and interferons, which did not show improved efficacy compared to standard care or placebo. Regarding remdesivir, the current body of evidence may conditionally support its use in COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen supplementation but still not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Finally, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been proven efficacious in reducing the risk of severe disease development if administered early in the course of the disease to patients at risk of progression. The results of the ongoing RCT will certainly be crucial to further improve our understanding of the optimal place in therapy of antiviral agents for COVID-19.","Bassetti, Matteo; Corcione, Silvia; Dettori, Silvia; Lombardi, Andrea; Lupia, Tommaso; Vena, Antonio; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Gori, Andrea; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto",Expert Rev Respir Med,,136

This study focuses on detecting sentiment in poems written in Misurata Arabic sub-dialect spoken in Misurata, Libya. The tools used to detect sentiment from the dataset are Sklearn as well as Mazajak sentiment tool 1. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers are used with Sklearn, while the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented with Mazajak. The results show that the traditional classifiers score a higher level of accuracy as compared to Mazajak which is built on an algorithm that includes deep learning techniques. More research is suggested to analyze Arabic sub-dialect poetry in order to investigate the aspects that contribute to sentiments in these multi-line texts; for example, the use of figurative language such as metaphors.","Abugharsa, Azza",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07203v1.pdf,136
465931,The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department visits for serious cardiovascular conditions,2021,"Overactivation of neuroimmune signaling has been linked to excessive ethanol consumption. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a major component of innate immune signaling and initiate anti- and pro-inflammatory responses via intracellular signal transduction cascades. TLR7 is upregulated in post-mortem brain tissue from humans with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and animals with prior exposure to ethanol. Despite this evidence, the role of TLR7 in the regulation of voluntary ethanol consumption has not been studied. We test the hypothesis that TLR7 activation regulates voluntary ethanol drinking behavior by administering a TLR7 agonist (R848) during an intermittent access drinking procedure in mice. Acute activation of TLR7 reduced ethanol intake, preference, and total fluid intake due, at least in part, to an acute sickness response. However, chronic pre-treatment with R848 resulted in tolerance to the adverse effects of the drug and a subsequent increase in ethanol consumption. To determine the molecular machinery that mediates these behavioral changes, we evaluated gene expression after acute and chronic TLR7 activation. We found that acute TLR7 activation produces brain region specific changes in expression of immune pathway genes, whereas chronic TLR7 activation causes downregulation of TLRs and blunted cytokine induction, suggesting molecular tolerance.

466583,"How the COVID-19 Epidemic Affected Prehospital Emergency Medical Services in Tehran, Iran",2020,"Abstract The recent outbreak of Zika virus infection increased the incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) Following the first reported case of GBS after Zika virus infection in 2013, there has been a considerable increase in the incidence of GBS in endemic countries such as French Polynesia and Latin American countries The association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and GBS is another emerging research hotspot Electrophysiological studies have suggested that GBS patients associated with Zika virus infection or COVID-19 tend to manifest acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, rather than acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) Causative autoantibodies, such as anti-ganglioside antibodies in AMAN associated with Campylobacter jejuni infection, have not been identified in GBS associated with these emerging infectious diseases Nevertheless, recent studies suggested molecular mimicry between these viruses and human proteins related to GBS Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of new vaccines, containing artificial messenger RNA encoding the spike protein of SARS-CoV2, against COVID-19 These vaccines are now available in many countries and massive vaccination campaigns are currently ongoing Although there are long-standing concerns about the increased risk of GBS after inoculation of conventional vaccines, the risk of GBS is not considered a legitimate reason to limit administration of currently available vaccines because the benefits outweigh the risks","Koike, Haruki Katsuno Masahisa",Clinical and Experimental Neuroimmunology,,136
466975,The Biochemical Parameters and Vitamin D Levels in ICU Patients with Covid-19: A Cross-Sectional Study,2021,"Background: The impact of the influenza A (H1N1) and SARS-CoV-2 virus on the development of autoimmune hepatitis has not been described previously. Methods: In this case series, we evaluated the dynamic changes in liver function of three patients with autoimmune hepatitis who presented with viral infection (two with the H1N1 and one with the SARS-CoV-2 virus) during the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Result: Patient 1 was a 68-year-old woman with a history of hepatitis of unknown origin before being infected with the H1N1 virus. Autoimmune hepatitis with an exacerbation of liver injury was diagnosed during the infection. Patient 2 was a 48-year-old woman with pre-existing autoimmune hepatitis. Despite being on immunosuppressant therapy (using glucocorticoids), liver injury recurred with elevated total bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels post H1N1 infection. Patient 3 was a 61-year-old woman with probable autoimmune hepatitis. Liver injury recurred with a flare in alanine transaminase/aspartate transaminase levels post SARS-CoV-2 infection, in spite of the patient being on liver protection therapy (using ursodeoxycholic acid). Conclusion: The case series raises the possibility that COVID-19 or influenza induced pneumonia triggers the progression of autoimmune hepatitis.","Li, Q.; Wang, J.; Zhou, X. S.; Lu, H. Z.; Lu, M.

466999,Protocol for a qualitative study to identify strategies to optimise hospital ePrescribing systems,2021,"Social distancing standards implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic may have negative effects on vertical traffic We describe a model and use it to predict the elevator traffic under social distancing in a university classroom building, and study the effects of four interventions aimed at improving this traffic Discrete event-based simulation is used to study whether the lift group meets the forecasted demand when the car capacity is restricted far below its ordinary value to accommodate social distancing Four low-cost interventions are simulated alone and in combination to quantify the improvements they offer All four interventions show some improvement, and the combination of all four interventions gives the greatest improvement Practical application: Implementing social distancing standards may disproportionately lower the car capacity relative to the building population and thus negatively affect vertical traffic Building managers seeking to implement low-cost measures to improve elevator traffic under these conditions may look to the percentage improvements described here to aid them in selecting interventions appropriate to their buildings","Swinarski, David",Building Services Engineering Research and Technology,,136
467103,Comment on: Coronavirus 2019 in Geriatrics and Long-Term Care: The ABCDs of COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the acceptability and usability of the Cogstate Brief Battery (CBB) in a community-based sample of Australian Indigenous people from the Torres Strait region, based on a user experience framework of human-computer interaction. METHODS: Two-hundred community participants completed the four subtests of the CBB on an iPad platform, during a free adult health check on two islands in the region, between October and December 2016. Acceptability was defined as completing the learning trial of a task and usability as continuing a task through to completion, determined by examiner acumen and internal Cogstate completion and integrity criteria. These were combined into a single dichotomous completion measure for logistic regression analyses. Performance-measured as reaction times and accuracy of responses-was analyzed using linear regression analyses. RESULTS: CBB completion ranged from 82.0% to 91.5% across the four tasks and the odds of completing decreased with age. After adjusting for age, iPad/tablet familiarity increased the odds of completion for all tasks while level of education and employment increased the odds for some tasks only. These variables accounted for 18.0%-23.8% of the variance in reaction times on speeded tasks. Age and education had the most effect, although semipartial correlations were modest. CONCLUSIONS: When administered in a health-screening context, the acceptability and usability of the CBB were greatest in young- to middle-aged participants with some education and iPad/tablet experience. Older and more vulnerable participants may have benefited from additional time and practice on the CBB prior to administration.","Thompson, Fintan; Cysique, Lucette A; Harriss, Linton R; Taylor, Sean; Savage, Greg; Maruff, Paul; Mcdermott, Robyn",Arch. clin. neuropsychol,,136

477769,Effectiveness of a Technology-Enhanced Integrated Care Model for Frail Older People: A Stepped-Wedge Cluster Randomized Trial in Nursing Homes,2020,"It is known that the elderly population has weak immune functioning and is a susceptible and high-risk group with respect to the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. In this study, to understand the influencing factors of COVID-19-related risks and coping behaviors of elderly individuals with respect to COVID-19 and to provide a basis for taking corresponding protective measures, a questionnaire survey was applied to an elderly population. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear regression analysis were used to explore the influencing factors of the level of understanding of COVID-19 risks among the elderly population. Additionally, the chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to explore the influencing factors of the elderly population's protective behaviors against COVID-19. This study found: (1) The sex, age, and self-care ability of elderly individuals were significantly correlated with their level of understanding of COVID-19, and that those who were female, were of a younger age, or had better self-care ability had higher levels of understanding; (2) The sex, place of residence, and level of understanding of COVID-19 among the elderly individuals were significantly correlated with their protective behaviors, e.g., those who were women, had high levels of understanding, and lived in cities were more likely to have good behaviors; (3) Elderly individuals' assessments of COVID-19 information provided by the government were significantly correlated with their protective behaviors-those who had a positive evaluation of relevant information provided by the government were more likely to develop protective behavior. The conclusions of this study show that it is crucial to implement COVID-19 prevention and control measures in the elderly population. Society, communities, and families need to increase their concerns about the health and risk awareness of the elderly individuals.","Sun, Zhonggen; Yang, Bingqing; Zhang, Ruilian; Cheng, Xin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,136
477867,Personal ventilation hood for protecting healthcare workers from aerosol-transmissible diseases,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the current global crisis unleashed by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 outbreak, surgical departments have considerably reduced the amount of elective surgeries. This decrease leads to less time in the surgical room to develop and improve the surgical skills of residents. In this study, we developed a training program to obtain and maintain microsurgical skills at home, using a smartphone camera and low-cost materials, affordable for everyone. METHODS: Using a smartphone camera as a magnification device, 6 participants performed 5 exercises (coloring grids, grouping colors, unraveling of a gauze, knots with suture threads, and tower of Hanoi), both with the dominant and with the nondominant hand, for 4 weeks. We compared performance at the beginning and at the end of the training process. Each participant filled out an anonymous survey. RESULTS: When we compared the performance at the beginning and at the end of the training process, we found significant improvements (P = 0.05) with the dominant as well as the nondominant hand in all the exercises. All participants were satisfied or very satisfied with the definition of the objectives of the training process, material availability, the exercises performed, the choice of the time to train, and general satisfaction with the training program. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a microsurgical skills training program to be performed at home, which can be easily reproduced. It allows residents to improve manual coordination skills and is regarded as a feasible adjunct for ongoing training for surgical residents.","Gallardo, Federico Carlos; Martin, Clara; Targa Garcia, Aylen Andrea; Bustamante, Jorge Luis; Nuñez, Maximiliano; Feldman, Santiago Enrique",World Neurosurg,,136
478158,"Knowledge and preventive practice to COVID-19 among household heads in Enugu metropolis, South-East Nigeria",2020,"BACKGROUND: In Aotearoa/New Zealand, the first nation-wide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown occurred from March 23, 2020 to May 13, 2020, requiring most people to stay at home. Health services had to suddenly change how they delivered healthcare and some services were limited or postponed. This study investigated access to healthcare during this lockdown period, whether patients delayed seeking healthcare and reasons for these delays, focusing on the accessibility of primary care services. METHODS: Adults (aged 18 years or older) who had contact with primary care services were invited through social media and email lists to participate in an online survey (n = 1010) and 38 people were recruited for in-depth interviews. We thematically analysed qualitative data from the survey and interviews, reported alongside relevant descriptive survey results. RESULTS: More than half (55%) of survey respondents delayed seeking healthcare during lockdown. Factors at a national or health system-level that could influence delay were changing public service messages, an excessive focus on COVID-19 and urgent issues, and poor service integration. Influential factors at a primary care-level were communication and outreach, use of technology, gatekeeping, staff manner and the safety of the clinical practice environment. Factors that influenced patients' individual decisions to seek healthcare were the ability to self-manage and self-triage, consciousness of perceived pressure on health services and fear of infection. CONCLUSION: In future pandemic lockdowns or crises, appropriate access to primary care services can be improved by unambiguous national messages and better integration of services. Primary care practices should adopt rapid proactive outreach to patients, fostering a calm but safe clinical practice environment. More support for patients to self-manage and self-triage appropriately could benefit over-burdened health systems during lockdowns and as part of business as usual in less extraordinary times.","Imlach, Fiona; McKinlay, Eileen; Kennedy, Jonathan; Pledger, Megan; Middleton, Lesley; Cumming, Jacqueline; McBride-Henry, Karen",Int. j. health policy manag,,136
478930,Ending the Pandemic: Are Rapid COVID-19 Tests a Step Forward or Back?,2021,"PURPOSE: In March 2020, the American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (ASOPRS) advised the suspension of all non-emergent oculofacial patient care, imparting unprecedented interruptions in fellowship training. METHODS: ASOPRS fellows and program directors were asked to complete an anonymous survey regarding their perceived impact of the COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS: Forty ASOPRS fellows (70.2%) participated, including 20 first-year and 20 second-year trainees, from all country regions. During the social distancing restrictions, 100% of fellows continued to participate in surgical procedures, including orbital biopsy (77.5%), abscess drainage (55.0%), fracture repair (45.6%), eyelid lesion excision (70.0%) and temporal artery biopsy (57.5%). ASOPRS fellows evaluated patients, including in emergency room (84.6%) and inpatient hospital (76.9%) settings, wearing surgical (85.0%) or N-95 (40.0%) masks, gloves (80.0%) and eye protection (62.5%). Most ASOPRS fellows (87.5%) participated in virtual interinstitutional education sessions and indicated a desire to continue this curriculum. Fellows also used available time for research (85.0%), independent study (77.5%), personal health (70.0%) and social interaction (60.0%). ASOPRS fellows reported COVID-19 restrictions to have a mild (72.5%) to moderate (27.5%) impact on their overall training, and most (75.0%) felt their surgical confidence to decline. Fellowship program directors also asserted a mild (72.2%), moderate (19.4%) or significant (5.6%) impact on subspecialty training, and 94.4% predict adverse effects on graduation case logs. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 restrictions most ASOPRS fellows participated in emergent clinical activities and novel telemedicine curriculum. Most fellows and program directors expressed concern regarding a negative impact on overall subspecialty education and surgical confidence.","Homer, Natalie A; Epstein, Aliza; Somogyi, Marie; Shore, John W",Orbit,,136

In this overall scenario, the disinfection processes have been largely improved. For instance, some countries have approved no-touch technologies by vaporizing disinfectants such as hydrogen peroxide, with the overriding goal to boost the safety of the places. In the era of sustainability, we designed an electrochemical paper-based device for the assessment of hydrogen peroxide nebulized by a cost-effective ultrasonic aroma diffuser. The paper-based sensor was fabricated by modifying via drop-casting a filter paper-based screen-printed electrode with a dispersion of carbon black-Prussian Blue nanocomposite, to assess the detection of hydrogen peroxide at -0.05 V vs Ag/AgCl. The use of paper-based modified screen-printed electrode loaded with phosphate buffer allowed for monitoring the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in aerosol, without any additional sampling instrument to capture the nebulized solution of hydrogen peroxide at a concentration up to 7 % w/w. Hydrogen peroxide, a reconverted ultrasonic aroma diffuser, and the paper-based electrochemical sensor assisted by smart-phone have demonstrated how different low-cost technologies are able to supply an useful and cost-effective solution for disinfection procedures.","Fiore, Luca; Mazzaracchio, Vincenzo; Galloni, Pierluca; Sabuzi, Federica; Pezzola, Silvia; Matteucci, Giorgia; Moscone, Danila; Arduini, Fabiana",Microchem J,,136

Additionally, we tested the effectiveness of a one-shot intervention based on the ""consider counter-arguments"" debiasing technique in changing COVID-19 unfounded beliefs. We used a convenience sample of 1439 participants who filled in the questionnaire on-line. Comparison of latent means showed that the ""consider counter-arguments"" intervention did not affect unfounded beliefs. Structural equation model, conducted on 962 participants with data on all variables, indicated that greater worry and weaker endorsement of COVID-19 unfounded beliefs lead to more responsible COVID-19 behavior.

Therefore, it is necessary to find out potential therapeutic pharmaceuticals for this disease. This study investigates the inhibitory effect of the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 (3CL pro) using pharmaceuticals containing α-ketoamide group and pyridone ring based on molecular docking. Of these, eight pharmaceuticals approved by US-Food and Drug Administration have shown good contact with the catalytic residues of 3CL pro. They are telaprevir, temsirolimus, pimecrolimus, aminoglutethimide, apixaban, buspirone, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide. Their binding affinity score ranged from -5.6 to -7.4 kcal/mol. Hydrogen bonds were observed and reported. To the knowledge, this study report for the first time a compound that could be binding to ALA 285, the new residue resulting from genetic modification of 3CL proof SARS-CoV-2 that has increased its catalytic activity 3.6-fold compared with its predecessor 3CL proof SARS-CoV. It is recommended that telaprevir, and pyridone-containing pharmaceuticals including aminoglutethimide, apixaban, buspirone, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment after suitable validation and clinical trials.","Elzupir, Amin O.",J.

490989,Update on clinical outcomes of women with COVID-19 during pregnancy,2020,"BACKGROUNDT cell responses to the common cold coronaviruses have not been well characterized. Preexisting T cell immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been reported, and a recent study suggested that this immunity was due to cross-recognition of the novel coronavirus by T cells specific for the common cold coronaviruses.METHODSWe used the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay to characterize the T cell responses against peptide pools derived from the spike protein of 3 common cold coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) and SARS-CoV-2 in 21 healthy donors (HDs) who were seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 and had no known exposure to the virus. An in vitro expansion culture assay was also used to analyze memory T cell responses.RESULTSWe found responses to the spike protein of the 3 common cold coronaviruses in many of the donors. We then focused on HCoV-NL63 and detected broad T cell responses to the spike protein and identified 22 targeted peptides. Interestingly, only 1 study participant had a significant response to SARS-CoV-2 spike or nucleocapsid protein in the ELISPOT assay. In vitro expansion studies suggested that T cells specific for the HCoV-NL63 spike protein in this individual could also recognize SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide pools.CONCLUSIONHDs have circulating T cells specific for the spike proteins of HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43.

497085,Emergency Department Visits for Nonfatal Opioid Overdose During the COVID-19 Pandemic Across Six US Health Care Systems,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic is showing an exponential growth, mandating an urgent need to develop an effective treatment. Indeed, to date, a well-established therapy is still lacking. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) added to standard care in patients with COVID-19. This was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial conducted at three major university hospitals in Egypt. One hundred ninety-four patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in the study after signing informed consent. They were equally randomized into two arms: 97 patients administrated HCQ plus standard care (HCQ group) and 97 patients administered only standard care as a control arm (control group). The primary endpoints were recovery within 28 days, need for mechanical ventilation, or death. The two groups were matched for age and gender. There was no significant difference between them regarding any of the baseline characteristics or laboratory parameters. Four patients (4.1%) in the HCQ group and 5 (5.2%) patients in the control group needed mechanical ventilation (P = 0.75). The overall mortality did not differ between the two groups, as six patients (6.2%) died in the HCQ group and 5 (5.2%) died in the control group (P = 0.77). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that HCQ treatment was not significantly associated with decreased mortality in COVID-19 patients. So, adding HCQ to standard care did not add significant benefit, did not decrease the need for ventilation, and did not reduce mortality rates in COVID-19 patients.","Abd-Elsalam, Sherief; Esmail, Eslam Saber; Khalaf, Mai; Abdo, Ehab Fawzy; Medhat, Mohammed A; Abd El Ghafar, Mohamed Samir; Ahmed, Ossama Ashraf; Soliman, Shaimaa; Serangawy, Ghada N; Alboraie, Mohamed",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,136

497115,Revisiting the Safety of Health Care Workers,2020,"Abstract Viral respiratory diseases (VRDs), such as influenza and COVID-19, are thought to spread faster over winter than during summer It has been previously argued that cold and dry conditions were more conducive to the transmission of VRD than warm and humid climates, although this relationship appears restricted to temperate regions, and the causal relationship is not well understood The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 has emerged as a serious global public health problem after the first COVID-19 reports in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 It is still unclear whether this novel respiratory disease will ultimately prove to be a seasonal endemic disease Here, we suggest that Air Drying Capacity (ADC;an atmospheric state-variable known to control the fate/evolution of the virus-laden droplets) and ultraviolet radiation (UV) are probable environmental determinants in shaping the transmission of COVID-19 at the seasonal time scale These variables, unlike temperature and humidity, provide a physically-based framework consistent with the apparent seasonal variability in COVID-19 prevalence across a broad range of climates (e g , Germany and India) Since this disease is known to be influenced by the compounding effect of social, biological, and environmental determinants, this study does not claim that these environmental determinants exclusively shape the seasonality of COVID-19 However, we argue that ADC and UV play a significant role in COVID-19 dynamics at the seasonal scale These findings could help guide the development of a sound adaptation strategy against the pandemic over the coming seasons","Choi, Yeon-Woo Tuel Alexandre Eltahir Elfatih A.

To this end, 382 nurses were the participants, data from 377 of whom were analyzed in total, with the following results. First, it showed that nurses' job engagement and job retention intention were high, depending on their age and work experience. Second, in terms of the factors related to COVID-19, the group with experience in nursing patients infected with COVID-19 and nurses working in COVID-19 divisions had low job retention intention. Lastly, it appeared that there were differences in job engagement and job retention intention depending on the category and type of social support. These results suggest that social support should be provided strategically to ensure nurses' job retention.","Kim, YoungJae Cho JeongHyung Lee SoYoung",Sustainability,,136

The framework, when applied requires faculty to evaluate current resources, align sessions to learning outcomes with student-centred approaches and to continuously improve based on implementation experiences. Using the framework, we were able to generate various types of online CCS learning sessions for implementation in a short period of time due to the recent Covid-19 pandemic. Importantly we learnt a few lessons post-implementation from both students and faculty perspective that will be used for planning and delivery of future sessions. In summary, the framework was useful for creating or redesigning CCS sessions which were disrupted during the pandemic, however post-implementation experience suggests the framework can also be used for future solutions in online CCS learning as healthcare systems and delivery are increasingly decentralised and widely distributed.","Nadarajah, Vishna Devi; Sow, Chew Fei; Syed Aznal, Sharifah Sulaiha; Montagu, Adam; Boursicot, Katharine; Er, Hui Meng",J Med Educ Curric Dev,,136

The majority of pregnant women have to be confined at home may be more vulnerable to stressors. In our study, we aimed to explore the effects of the epidemic on maternal thyroid function, so as to provide evidence for prevention and intervention of sustained maternal and offspring's health impairment produced by thyroid dysfunction. METHODS: The subjects were selected from an ongoing prospective cohort study. we included the pregnant women who receive a thyroid function test during the COVID-19 epidemic and those receiving the test during the corresponding lunar period of 2019. A total of 7148 pregnant women with complete information were included in the final analysis. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used for analyzing the association of COVID-19 pandemic with FT4 levels and isolated hypothyroxinemia. RESULTS: We found a decreased maternal FT4 level during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic in first and second trimesters (ß = -0. 131, 95%CI = -0.257,-0.006ï¼p = 0.040) and in first trimester (ß = -0. 0.176, 95%CI = -0.326,-0.026ï¼p = 0.022) when adjusting for 25 (OH) vitamin D, vitamin B12, folate and ferritin and gestational days, maternal socio-demographic characteristics and health conditions. The status of pandemic increased the risks of isolated hypothyroxinemia in first and second trimesters (OR = 1.547, 95%CI = 1.251,1.913, p < 0.001) and first trimester (OR = 1.651, 95%CI = 1.289,2.114, p < 0.001) when adjusting for the covariates. However, these associations disappeared in the women with positive TPOAb (p > 0.05). Additionally, we found associations between daily reported new case of COVID-19 and maternal FT4 for single-day lag1, lag3 and multi-day lag01 and lag04 when adjusting for the covariates (each p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Mass confinement as a primary community control strategy may have a significant cost to public health resources. Access to health service systems and adequate medical resources should be improved for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hua, Jing; Shen, Jiajin; Zhang, Jiajia; Zhou, Yingchun; Du, Wenchong; Williams, Gareth J",Psychoneuroendocrinology,,136
500418,COVID-19-Associated Deaths in San Francisco: the Important Role of Dementia and Atypical Presentations in Long-term Care Facilities,2020,"BACKGROUND: We sought to clarify the benefit of cytokine adsorption in patients with COVID-19 supported with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). METHODS: We did a single-centre, open-label, randomised, controlled trial to investigate cytokine adsorption in adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ECMO. Patients with COVID-19 selected for ECMO at the Freiburg University Medical Center (Freiburg, Germany) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive cytokine adsorption using the CytoSorb device or not. Randomisation was computer-generated, allocation was concealed by opaque, sequentially numbered sealed envelopes. The CytoSorb device was incorporated into the ECMO circuit before connection to the patient circuit, replaced every 24 h, and removed after 72 h. The primary endpoint was serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration 72 h after initiation of ECMO analysed by intention to treat. Secondary endpoints included 30-day survival. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04324528) and the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00021300) and is closed. FINDINGS: From March 29, 2020, to Dec 29, 2020, of 34 patients assessed for eligibility, 17 (50%) were treated with cytokine adsorption and 17 (50%) without. Median IL-6 decreased from 357·0 pg/mL to 98·6 pg/mL in patients randomly assigned to cytokine adsorption and from 289·0 pg/mL to 112·0 pg/mL in the control group after 72 h. One patient in each group died before 72 h. Adjusted mean log IL-6 concentrations after 72 h were 0·30 higher in the cytokine adsorption group (95% CI -0·70 to 1·30, p=0·54). Survival after 30 days was three (18%) of 17 with cytokine adsorption and 13 (76%) of 17 without cytokine adsorption (p=0·0016). INTERPRETATION: Early initiation of cytokine adsorption in patients with severe COVID-19 and venovenous ECMO did not reduce serum IL-6 and had a negative effect on survival. Cytokine adsorption should not be used during the first days of ECMO support in COVID-19.

501476,263 Utilizing Telemedicine in a Novel Approach to COVID-19 Management and Patient Experience in the Emergency Department,2020,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays an essential role in maintaining the balance of the renin-angiotensin system and also serves as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63. Following the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there has been an urgent need to develop therapeutic interventions. ACE2 is a potential target for many treatment approaches for the SARS-CoV-2. With the help of bioinformatics, we have predicted several novel exons of the human ACE2 gene. The inclusion of novel exons located in the 5'UTR/intronic region in the mature transcript may remove the critical ACE2 residues responsible for the interaction with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, thus preventing their binding and entry into the cell. Additionally, inclusion of a novel predicted exons located in the 3'UTR by alternative splicing may remove the C-terminal transmembrane domain of ACE2 and generate soluble ACE2 isoforms. Splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (SSOs) have been employed effectively as a therapeutic strategy in several disease conditions. Alternative splicing of the ACE2 gene could similarly be modulated using SSOs to exclude critical domains required for the entry of SARS-CoV-2. Strategies can also be designed to deliver these SSOs directly to the lungs in order to minimize the damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.","Rehman, Sayeed Ur; Tabish, Mohammad",Clin Sci (Lond),,136

The outbreak has posed a huge challenge to countries around the world and has resulted in a global lockdown. The pandemic has especially overburdened the healthcare sector, resulting in a shortage of personnel and equipment. Along with many other manifestations, it has resulted in stress and anxiety for the physicians as well. Furthermore, many healthcare workers have been reluctant in treating COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to explore the concerns of physicians in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the reasons for their reluctance to treat the patients. Methodology This descriptive cross-sectional study included 235 physicians from seven hospitals of Pakistan who were actively working amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from March 1, 2020, to May 30, 2020, using a structured online questionnaire. Participants were approached via non-probability convenient sampling. Two hundred and eight respondents were included in the data analysis. SPSS Statistics version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used for data entry and analysis. Results A striking 83.7% (n=174) of the respondents expressed their reluctance to treat patients with COVID-19. Concerns they raised included one or more of the following four reasons; lack of proper personal protective equipment (PPE), fear of self-infection, excessive workload, and fear of transmitting the infection to their family members. Of note, 92% (n=161) of the respondents reported a lack of PPE while 74.1% (n=129) reported fear of transmitting the infection to their family members as reasons for their reluctance. The vast majority of the participants reported the need for psychological training to treat the patients' anxiety (95.2%, n=198). Many participants were afraid that their own anxiety might be affecting the quality of care patients were receiving (67.3%, n=140). Hence, most of the participants reported that psychological counseling should be provided (93.3%, n=194). Participants with family members older than 60 years were found to be reluctant to treat patients due to the risk of transmitting the infection to them (69.7%, n=145, p=0.001). Therefore, a major proportion of the participants (96.2%, n=200) felt that the hospitals should provide a place for them to rest and temporarily isolate themselves to avoid coming into contact with their family members. Conclusions We conclude that a major proportion of physicians is reluctant to treat their patients due to multiple factors. The grave situation of the pandemic has taken a toll on their mental health, which could be affecting the quality of care that the patients receive. Their concerns should be addressed to not only provide them with support and improve their working environment but also to ensure that they are fully equipped to provide state-of-the-art care to the patients in these grave times.","Ayub, Maheen; Arshad, Daneyal; Maqbool, Naheed; Zahid, Mahnoor; Malik, Rabia S; Rizvi, Zuhair Ali; Arshad, Usman; Khan, Saleem Ullah",Cureus,,136

Environmental factors are the important regulators of COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to determine the impact of weather on the COVID-19 cases, fatalities and frequency of mutations in Bangladesh. The impacts were determined on 1, 7 and 14 days of the case. The study was conducted based on Spearman's correlation coefficients. The highest correlation was found between population density and cases (rs = 0.712). Among metrological parameters, average temperature had the strongest correlation (rs = -0.675) with the cases. About 82% of Bangladeshi isolates had D614G at spike protein. Both temperature and UV index had strong effects on the frequency of mutations. Among host factors, coinfection is highly associated with frequency of different mutations. This study will give a complete picture of the effects of metrological parameters on COVID-19 cases, fatalities and mutation frequency that will help the authorities to take proper decisions.","Sharif, Nadim; Dey, Shuvra Kanti",Epidemiol Infect,,136

The purpose of this study was to assess the impacts of the lockdown measures on air quality and pollutant emissions in Valencia, Spain. For this reason, we determined if there was a significant difference in the concentration levels of different particulate matter (PM) sizes, PM10, PM2.5, and NOx, NO2, NO, and O3, between the period of restrictions in 2020 and the same period in 2019. Our findings indicated that PM pollutant levels during the lockdown period were significantly different from the same period of the previous year, even if there is variability in the different local areas. The highest variations reduction in the PM10 and PM2.5 levels were observed for the València Centre, València Avd Francia, and València Pista de Silla (all of the urban traffic type) in which there was a reduction of 58%-42%, 56%-53%, and 60%-41% respectively. Moreover, consistent with recent studies, we observed a significant reduction in nitric oxide levels in all the air monitoring stations. In all seven monitoring stations, it was observed, in 2020, NOx, NO2, and NO concentrations decreased by 48.5%-49.8%-46.2%, 62.1%-67.4%-45.7%, 37.4%-35.7%-35.3%, 60.7%-67.7%-47.1%, 65.5%-65.8%-63.5%, 60.0%-64.5%-41.3%, and 60.4%-61.6%-52.5%, respectively. Lastly, overall O3 levels decreased during the lockdown period, although this phenomenon was more closely related to weather conditions. Overall, no significant differences were observed between the meteorological conditions in 2019 and 2020. Our findings suggest that further studies on the effect of human activities on air quality are needed and encourage the adoption of a holistic approach to improve urban air quality.","Donzelli, Gabriele; Cioni, Lorenzo; Cancellieri, Mariagrazia; Llopis-Morales, Agustin; Morales-Suárez-Varela, María",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,136

Commercial one-step master mixes-which include both a reverse transcriptase and a thermostable polymerase and thus allow performing both the RT and qPCR steps consecutively in a sealed well-are key reagents for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing; yet, these are typically expensive and have been affected by supply shortages in periods of high demand. As an alternative, we describe here how to express and purify Taq polymerase and M-MLV reverse transcriptase and assemble a homemade one-step RT-qPCR master mix. This mix can be easily assembled from scratch in any laboratory equipped for protein purification. We also describe two simple alternative methods to prepare clinical swab samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by RT-qPCR: heat-inactivation for direct addition, and concentration of RNA by isopropanol precipitation. Finally, we describe how to perform RT-qPCR using the homemade master mix, how to prepare in vitro-transcribed RNA standards, and how to use a fluorescence imager for endpoint detection of RT-PCR amplification in the absence of a qPCR machine In addition to being useful for diagnostics, these versatile protocols may be adapted for nucleic acid quantification in basic research. © 2021 The Authors.

METHODS: Medline was searched for English-language randomized clinical trials between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018. Randomized clinical trials were eligible if the primary goal was to provide rehabilitation services to targeted patient populations. Two authors independently screened and extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality of eligible trials. Descriptive analysis was used to compare service descriptions between eligible trials and the ICSO-R 2.0 framework (23 categories, 9 categories for provider, 14 categories for delivery). RESULTS: Twenty-nine randomized clinical trials, with a wide range of organizational units and target groups, were included. The median number of categories reported in the provider dimension was 4 (range 3-5). The median number of categories reported in the service delivery dimension was 8 (range 6-12). None of the randomized clinical trials described all ICSO-R recommended categories. CONCLUSION: Descriptions of service organization in rehabilitation varied widely among recently published randomized clinical trials. Use of the framework for the classification of service organization and standardization of description of services is recommended in future randomized clinical trials, to facilitate better comparisons in service research across studies.","Andelic, Nada; Lu, Juan; Gutenbrunner, Christoph; Nugraha, Boya; Gormley, Mirinda; Søberg, Helene L; Sveen, Unni; Anke, Audny; Kirkevold, Marit; Røe, Cecilie",J. rehabil. med,,136

Although great progress has been made in the development of effective countermeasures, with several pharmaceutical companies approved or poised to deliver vaccines to market, there is still an unmet need of essential antiviral drugs with therapeutic impact for the treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Towards this goal, a high-throughput assay was used to screen SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 uracil-dependent endonuclease (endoU) function against 13 thousand compounds from drug and lead repurposing compound libraries. While over 80% of initial hit compounds were pan-assay inhibitory compounds, three hits were confirmed as nsp15 endoU inhibitors in the 1-20 µM range in vitro. Furthermore, Exebryl-1, a ß-amyloid anti-aggregation molecule for Alzheimer's therapy, was shown to have antiviral activity between 10 to 66 µM, in Vero 76, Caco-2, and Calu-3 cells. Although the inhibitory concentrations determined for Exebryl-1 exceed those recommended for therapeutic intervention, our findings show great promise for further optimization of Exebryl-1 as an nsp15 endoU inhibitor and as a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral.","Choi, Ryan; Zhou, Mowei; Shek, Roger; Wilson, Jesse W; Tillery, Logan; Craig, Justin K; Salukhe, Indraneel A; Hickson, Sarah E; Kumar, Neeraj; James, Rhema M; Buchko, Garry W; Wu, Ruilian; Huff, Sydney; Nguyen, Tu-Trinh; Hurst, Brett L; Cherry, Sara; Barrett, Lynn K; Hyde, Jennifer L; Van Voorhis, Wesley C",PLoS One,,136

Possible inactivation, downstream, and formulation conditions are given including suitable buffers and some first ideas for quality-control methods. This information supports vaccine development and discussion with competent authorities during vaccine approval and is certainly related to drug-targeting strategies and hygienics. Several instructive tables are given, including the pI and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) of SARS-CoV-1 and -2 proteins in comparison. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar in many regards, so information can often be derived. Both are unusually stable, but sensitive at their lipophilic membranes. However, since seemingly small differences can have strong effects, for example, on immunologically relevant epitope settings, unevaluated knowledge transfer from SARS-CoV-1 to SARS-CoV-2 cannot be advised. Published knowledge regarding downstream processes, formulations and quality assuring methods is, as yet, limited. However, standard approaches employed for other viruses and vaccines seem to be feasible including virus inactivation, centrifugation conditions, and the use of adjuvants.","Scheller, Christin; Krebs, Finja; Minkner, Robert; Astner, Isabel; Gil-Moles, Maria; Wätzig, Hermann",Electrophoresis,,136
514611,Supplements for the Treatment of Mild COVID-19-Challenging Health Beliefs With Science From A to Z,2021,"BACKGROUND: Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) is a new, rare, post-infectious complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. We aimed to describe the 6-month outcomes of PIMS-TS. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study comprised children (aged <18 years) who fulfilled the UK Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) diagnostic criteria for PIMS-TS and were admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital (London, UK) between April 4 and Sept 1, 2020. Patients were followed up by a multidisciplinary team of specialists at 6 weeks and 6 months after admission. Biochemical and functional outcomes were analysed. FINDINGS: 46 children were included in this study. The median age at presentation was 10·2 years (IQR 8·8-13·3), 30 (65%) patients were male and 16 (35%) were female, 37 (80%) were from minority ethnic groups, and eight (17%) had pre-existing comorbidities. All patients had elevated markers of systemic inflammation at baseline. None of the patients died. By 6 months, systemic inflammation was resolved in all but one patient. 38 (90%) of 42 patients who had positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies within 6 weeks of admission remained seropositive at 6 months. Echocardiograms were normal in 44 (96%) of 46 patients by 6 months, and gastrointestinal symptoms that were reported in 45 (98%) of 46 patients at onset were present in six (13%) of 46 patients at 6 months. Renal, haematological, and otolaryngological findings largely resolved by 6 months. Although minor abnormalities were identified on neurological examination in 24 (52%) of 46 patients at 6 weeks and in 18 (39%) of 46 at 6 months, we found minimal functional impairment at 6 months (median Expanded Disability Status Scale score 0 [IQR 0-1]). Median manual muscle test-8 scores improved from 53 (IQR 43-64) during hospital admission to 80 (IQR 68-80) at 6 months, but 18 (45%) of 40 patients showed 6-min walk test results below the third centile for their age or sex at 6 months. PedsQL responses revealed severe emotional difficulties at 6 months (seven [18%] of 38 by parental report and eight [22%] of 38 by self report). 45 (98%) of 46 patients were back in full-time education (virtually or face to face) by 6 months. INTERPRETATION: Despite initial severe illness, few organ-specific sequelae were observed at 6 months. Ongoing concerns requiring physical re-conditioning and mental health support remained, and physiotherapy assessments revealed persisting poor exercise tolerance. Longer-term follow-up will help define the extended natural history of PIMS-TS.

METHODS: The Italian Stroke Organization performed a multicenter study involving 93 Italian Stroke Units. We collected information on hospital admissions for cerebrovascular events from March 1 to March 31, 2020 (study period), and from March 1 to March 31, 2019 (control period). RESULTS: Ischemic strokes decreased from 2399 in 2019 to 1810 in 2020, with a corresponding hospitalization rate ratio (RR) of 0.75 ([95% CI, 0.71-0.80] P<0.001); intracerebral hemorrhages decreased from 400 to 322 (hospitalization RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.69-0.93]; P=0.004), and transient ischemic attacks decreased from 322 to 196 (hospitalization RR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.51-0.73]; P<0.001). Hospitalizations decreased in Northern, Central, and Southern Italy. Intravenous thrombolyses decreased from 531 (22.1%) in 2019 to 345 in 2020 (19.1%; RR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75-0.99]; P=0.032), while primary endovascular procedures increased in Northern Italy (RR, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.13-2.32]; P=0.008). We found no correlation (P=0.517) between the hospitalization RRs for all strokes or transient ischemic attack and COVID-19 incidence in the different areas. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations for stroke or transient ischemic attacks across Italy were reduced during the worst period of the COVID-19 outbreak. Intravenous thrombolytic treatments also decreased, while endovascular treatments remained unchanged and even increased in the area of maximum expression of the outbreak. Limited hospitalization of the less severe patients and delays in hospital admission, due to overcharge of the emergency system by COVID-19 patients, may explain these data.","Sacco, Simona; Ricci, Stefano; Ornello, Raffaele; Eusebi, Paolo; Petraglia, Luca; Toni, Danilo",Stroke,,136

Interpersonal distance is critical for the spread dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19's spread trend shows various characteristics in different countries. We believe that 1 of the factors influencing this variation could be national interpersonal distance preference. METHODS: We used regression analysis based on data of national interpersonal distance preferences (social, personal, and intimate) presented by Sorokowska et al. and COVID-19 rate of spread data for 40 different countries that were calculated using Our World in Data's data. RESULTS: National interpersonal distance preferences, with its 3 dimensions, significantly influence the rate of spread of COVID-19 in countries. CONCLUSION: Understanding the relation between national interpersonal distance preference and spread of COVID-19 might be very useful information in decision-making processes of individuals, societies, and governments to develop culturally well-suited counter-pandemic policies, strategies, and procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic or any epidemic or pandemic threats in the future, instead of standard fit-to-all strategies.","Gokmen, Yunus; Turen, Ufuk; Erdem, Haluk; Tokmak, Ismail",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,136

It contributes to host defense by interference with bacterial iron uptake and exerts immunomodulatory functions in various diseases. Here, we aimed to characterize the function of LCN2 in lung macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) using Lcn2-/- mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed strong LCN2-related effects in CD103+ DCs during homeostasis, with differential regulation of antigen processing and presentation and antiviral immunity pathways. We next validated the relevance of LCN2 in a mouse model of influenza infection, wherein LCN2 protected from excessive weight loss and improved survival. LCN2-deficiency was associated with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and increased lung T cell numbers, indicating a dysregulated immune response to influenza infection. Depletion of CD8+ T cells equalized weight loss between WT and Lcn2-/- mice, proving that LCN2 protects from excessive disease morbidity by dampening CD8+ T cell responses. In vivo T cell chimerism and in vitro T cell proliferation assays indicated that improved antigen processing by CD103+ DCs, rather than T cell intrinsic effects of LCN2, contribute to the exacerbated T cell response. Considering the antibacterial potential of LCN2 and that commensal microbes can modulate antiviral immune responses, we speculated that LCN2 might cause the observed influenza phenotype via the microbiome. Comparing the lung and gut microbiome of WT and Lcn2-/- mice by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we observed profound effects of LCN2 on gut microbial composition. Interestingly, antibiotic treatment or co-housing of WT and Lcn2-/- mice prior to influenza infection equalized lung CD8+ T cell counts, suggesting that the LCN2-related effects are mediated by the microbiome. In summary, our results highlight a novel regulatory function of LCN2 in the modulation of antiviral immunity.","Watzenboeck, Martin L; Drobits, Barbara; Zahalka, Sophie; Gorki, Anna-Dorothea; Farhat, Asma; Quattrone, Federica; Hladik, Anastasiya; Lakovits, Karin; Richard, Gabriel M; Lederer, Therese; Strobl, Birgit; Versteeg, Gijs A; Boon, Louis; Starkl, Philipp; Knapp, Sylvia",PLoS Pathog,,136

Urban areas were particularly affected by the virus spread. In this review, we analyze how the urban environment may influence mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, considering two factors that profoundly characterize urbanization: air pollution and migration. Air pollution serves as a possibly risk factor for higher viral spread and infection severity in the context of urban areas and it has also been demonstrated to play a role in the development of serious mental illnesses and their relapses. The urban environment also represents a complex social context where minorities such as migrants may live in poor hygienic conditions and lack access to adequate mental health care. A global rethinking of the urban environment is thus required to reduce the impact of these factors on mental health. This should include actions aimed at reducing air pollution and combating climate change, promoting at the same time a more inclusive society in a sustainable development perspective.","Menculini, G.; Bernardini, F.; Attademo, L.; Balducci, P.

Stringent border control together with aggressive case finding, contact tracing, social distancing and quarantine measures were implemented to halt the importation and spread of the virus. METHODS: We performed an epidemiological study using government information covering the first 100 confirmed cases to examine the epidemic curve, incidence, clusters, reproduction number (Rt), incubation period and time to containment. RESULTS: A total of 93 of the 100 cases were HK residents (6 infected in Mainland China, 10 on the Diamond Princess Cruise). Seven were visitors infected in Mainland China before entering HK. The majority (76%) were aged &#8805;45 years, and the incidence increased with age (P < 0.001). Escalation of border control measures correlated with a decrease in the proportion (62.5% to 0%) of cases imported from Mainland China, and a reduction in Rt (1.07 to 0.75). The median incubation period was 4.2 days [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.0-4.5; 5th and 95th percentiles: 1.3 and 14.0). Most clusters with identifiable epidemiological links were households involving 2-4 people. Three medium-spreading events were identified: two from New Year gatherings (6-11 people), and another from environmental contamination of a worship hall (12 people). Despite intensified contact tracing, containment was delayed in 78.9% of cases (mean = 5.96 days, range = 0-24 days). An unusual transmission in a multi-storey building via faulty toilet plumbing was suspected with >100 residents evacuated overnight. Our analysis indicated that faulty plumbing was unlikely to be the source of this transmission. CONCLUSION: Timely stringent containment policies minimized the importation and transmission of COVID-19 in HK.","Lai, Christopher K C; Ng, Rita W Y; Wong, Martin C S; Chong, Ka Chun; Yeoh, Yun Kit; Chen, Zigui; Chan, Paul K S",Int J Epidemiol,,136

While challenges associated with the COVID-19 trial landscape have been discussed previously, no comprehensive reviews have been conducted to assess the reporting, design, and data sharing practices of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). PURPOSE: The purpose of this review was to gain insight into the current landscape of reporting, methodological design, and data sharing practices for COVID-19 RCTs. DATA SOURCES: We conducted three searches to identify registered clinical trials, peer-reviewed publications, and pre-print publications. STUDY SELECTION: After screening eight major trial registries and 7844 records, we identified 178 registered trials and 38 publications describing 35 trials, including 25 peer-reviewed publications and 13 pre-prints. DATA EXTRACTION: Trial ID, registry, location, population, intervention, control, study design, recruitment target, actual recruitment, outcomes, data sharing statement, and time of data sharing were extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 178 registered trials, 112 (62.92%) were in hospital settings, median planned recruitment was 100 participants (IQR: 60, 168), and the majority (n = 166, 93.26%) did not report results in their respective registries. Of 35 published trials, 31 (88.57%) were in hospital settings, median actual recruitment was 86 participants (IQR: 55.5, 218), 10 (28.57%) did not reach recruitment targets, and 27 trials (77.14%) reported plans to share data.

Potently neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on MERS-CoV spike (S) protein have been characterized, but much less is known about antibodies targeting non-RBD epitopes. Here we report the structural and functional characterization of G2, a neutralizing antibody targeting MERS-CoV S1 N-terminal domain (S1-NTD). Structures of G2 alone and in complex with the MERS-CoV S1-NTD defined a site of vulnerability comprising two loops, each of which contained a residue mutated in G2-escape variants. Cell-surface binding studies and in vitro competition experiments demonstrated that G2 strongly disrupts the attachment of MERS-CoV S to its receptor DDP4, with the inhibition requiring the native trimeric S conformation. These results advance our understanding of antibody-mediated neutralization of coronaviruses and should facilitate development of immunotherapeutics and vaccines against MERS-CoV.","Wang, Nianshuang; Rosen, Osnat; Wang, Lingshu; Turner, Hannah L.; Stevens, Laura J.; Corbett, Kizzmekia S.; Bowman, Charles A.; Pallesen, Jesper; Shi, Wei; Zhang, Yi; Leung, Kwanyee; Kirchdoerfer, Robert N.; Becker, Michelle M.; Denison, Mark R.; Chappell, James D.; Ward, Andrew B.; Graham, Barney S.; McLellan, Jason S.",Cell Reports,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124719311003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124719311003; http://www.cell.com/article/S2211124719311003/pdf; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.08.052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553909/,136
591129,26 Implementation of a COVID-19 Vaccine Emergency Department Education Program for Underserved Communities: A Pilot Quality Improvement Project,2021-08-31,"Early detection of disease outbreaks in human and animal populations is crucial to the effective surveillance of emerging infectious diseases. However, there are marked geographical disparities in capacity for early detection of outbreaks, which limit the effectiveness of global surveillance strategies. Linking surveillance approaches for emerging and neglected endemic zoonoses, with a renewed focus on existing disease problems in developing countries, has the potential to overcome several limitations and to achieve additional health benefits. Poor reporting is a major constraint to the surveillance of both emerging and endemic zoonoses, and several important barriers to reporting can be identified: (i) a lack of tangible benefits when reports are made; (ii) a lack of capacity to enforce regulations; (iii) poor communication among communities, institutions and sectors; and (iv) complexities of the international regulatory environment. Redirecting surveillance efforts to focus on endemic zoonoses in developing countries offers a pragmatic approach that overcomes some of these barriers and provides support in regions where surveillance capacity is currently weakest. In addition, this approach addresses immediate health and development problems, and provides an equitable and sustainable mechanism for building the culture of surveillance and the core capacities that are needed for all zoonotic pathogens, including emerging disease threats.","Halliday, Jo; Daborn, Chris; Auty, Harriet; Mtema, Zacharia; Lembo, Tiziana; Bronsvoort, Barend M. deC.; Handel, Ian; Knobel, Darryn; Hampson, Katie; Cleaveland, Sarah",Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22966142/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2011.0362,136

The way of splitting and processing the mixture of materials was studied as well as the final properties such as chemical, thermal and mechanical characteristics. The resulting recycled material is a blend of polymers with such mechanical and thermal properties that could be used as an alternative to recycled PP (polypropylene). Avoidance of previous sorting process gives the face mask recycling a new and simplified way of preventing this material to be disposed in environment and an opportunity of second life for the polymers they are made of.

This symptom sometimes may be the only sign of the disease, therefore it must be research widely. OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate odor dysfunction in COVID-19 patients objectively and safely without any risk of transmitting the disease. METHODS: The odor threshold test was performed on 105 patients hospitalized at the XXXX Training and Research Hospital on the COVID-19 pandemic service before any treatment began. Odor threshold was tested using a modification of the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center olfactory function test. COVID-19 signs and symptoms, PCR test results, thorax computed tomography (CT) findings, and length of hospital stay were recorded. Odor tests were scored between 0–8, 0–1 anosmia, 2–3 severely hyposmia, 4 moderate hyposmia, 5 mild hyposmia, 6 and above normosmia. RESULTS: Forty-one (39%) of the 105 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 after the PCR results. Patients with an odor threshold score < 5 were classified as “Smell-Impaired Group”, patients with an odor threshold score ≥ 5 were placed in “Smell Intact Group”. The incidence of female patients in smell-impaired group was significantly higher (p ˂ 0.05). The proportion of patients who were PCR-positive for COVID-19 in smell-impaired group was significantly higher (p ˂ 0.05) than in smell intact group. Among patients with an odor threshold score from 0 to 1 (anosmic; n = 15), 12 (80%) demonstrated PCR positivity (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Anosmia can be predictive for coronavirus disease.

The real data available about number of infected cases from 14 March, 2000 to 26 March, 2020 is analysed and, accordingly, various parameters of the model are estimated or fitted. The Picard successive approximation technique and Banach’s fixed point theory have been used for verification of the existence and stability criteria of the model. Further, we conduct stability analysis for both disease-free and endemic equilibrium states. On the basis of sensitivity analysis and dynamics of the threshold parameter, we estimate the effectiveness of preventive measures, predicting future outbreaks and potential control strategies of the disease using the proposed model. Numerical computations are carried out utilising the iterative Laplace transform method and comparative study of different fractional differential operators is done.

Although insufficient to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of infection, antibody assays can be of great use for surveillance studies or for some coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients presenting late to the hospital. Methods This study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of four commercial SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow antibody tests using 213 serum specimens from 90 PCR-positive confirmed COVID-19 patients. Of 59 negative control sera, 50 were obtained from patients with other respiratory infectious diseases before COVID-19 pandemic began while nine were from patients infected with other respiratory viruses, including two seasonal coronaviruses. Results The varied sensitivities for the four commercial kits were 70.9%, 65.3%, 45.1%, and 65.7% for BioMedomics, Autobio Diagnostics, Genbody, and KURABO, respectively, between sick days 1 and 155 in COVID-19 patients. The sensitivities of the four tests gradually increased over time after infection before sick day 5 (15.0%, 12.5%, 15.0%, and 20.0%); from sick day 11 to 15 (95.7%, 87.2%, 53.2%, and 89.4%); and after sick day 20 (100%, 100%, 68.6%, and 96.1%), respectively. For severe illness, the sensitivities were quite high in the late phase after sick day 15. The specificities were over 96% for all four tests. No cross-reaction due to other pathogens, including seasonal coronaviruses, was observed. Conclusions Our results demonstrated the large differences in the antibody test performances.

However, there is an urgent need for a quick and accurate antibody-based point-of-care (POC) test method to quickly identify evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people who might be missed through active case finding and surveillance efforts. Serology tests measure the presence of antibodies in serum after infection. Here we compared the performance characteristics of six commercially available antibody-based POC devices and their potential for identification of individuals infected at some time by SARS-CoV-2.","Furuya, Andrea K.M.; Wagner, Christine; Connors, Julia; Bodnar, Janine; Miller, Thomas; Ryman, Nko Lea; Warszycki, Casey J.; Wong, Susan J.; Walsh, Anne C.; McDonough, Kathleen A.; Lee, William T.",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732889320306751?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0732889320306751; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2020.115298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33418405/,136

However, additional studies are required to facilitate interpretation of results, including how antibody levels impact immunity and disease course. METHODS: A total of 967 subjects were tested for IgG antibodies reactive to SARS-CoV-2, including 172 suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2, 656 plasma samples from healthy donors, 49 sera from patients with rheumatic disease, and 90 specimens from individuals positive for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based respiratory viral panel. A subgroup of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive cases was tested for IgM antibodies by proteome array method. RESULTS: All specificity and cross-reactivity specimens were negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (0/795, 0%). Positive agreement of IgG with PCR was 83% of samples confirmed to be more than 14 days from symptom onset, with less than 100% sensitivity attributable to a case with severe immunosuppression. Virus-specific IgM was positive in a higher proportion of cases less than 3 days from symptom onset. No association was observed between mild and severe disease course with respect to IgG and IgM levels. CONCLUSIONS: The studied SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay had 100% specificity and no adverse cross-reactivity. Measures of IgG and IgM antibodies did not predict disease severity in our patient population.","Phipps, William S; SoRelle, Jeffrey A; Li, Quan-Zhen; Mahimainathan, Lenin; Araj, Ellen; Markantonis, John; Lacelle, Chantale; Balani, Jyoti; Parikh, Hiren; Solow, E Blair; Karp, David R; Sarode, Ravi; Muthukumar, Alagarraju",Am J Clin Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32666092/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa123,136

The methods used in this research paper include a review of literature, anecdotal evidence, and reports on the morbidity of COVID-19, including the scope of its devastating effects in different countries such as the US, Africa, UK, China, and Brazil, among others. The findings of this study suggested that the devastating effects of the coronavirus are felt across different vulnerable populations. These include the elderly, front-line workers, marginalized communities, visible minorities, and more. The challenge in Africa is especially daunting because of inadequate infrastructure, and financial and human resources, among others. Besides, AI technology is being successfully used by scientists to enhance the development process of vaccines and drugs. However, its usage in other stages of the pandemic has not been adequately explored. Ultimately, it has been concluded that the effects of the Covid-19 are producing unprecedented and catastrophic outcomes in many countries. With a few exceptions, the common and current intervention approach is driven by many factors, including the compilation of relevant reliable and compelling data sets. On a positive note, the compelling trailblazing and catalytic contributions of AI towards the rapid discovery of COVID-19 vaccines are a good indication of future technological innovations and their effectiveness.","Lainjo, Bongs",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s321751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34475763/,136
597305,"COVID-19 crisis: an extraordinary time for collaboration and science—a call for leadership, now and beyond",2020-04-29,"The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented public health crisis with broad social and economic consequences. We conducted four surveys between April and August 2020 using the graph-based open-ended survey (GOS) framework, and investigated the most pressing concerns and issues for the general public in Japan. The GOS framework is a hybrid of the two traditional survey frameworks that allows respondents to post their opinions in a free-format style, which can subsequently serve as one of the choice items for other respondents, just as in a multiple-choice survey. As a result, this framework generates an opinion graph that relates opinions and respondents. We can also construct annotated opinion graphs to achieve a higher resolution. By clustering the annotated opinion graphs, we revealed the characteristic evolution of the response patterns as well as the interconnectedness and multi-faceted nature of opinions. Substantively, our notable finding is that “social pressure,” not “infection risk,” was one of the major concerns of our respondents. Social pressure refers to criticism and discrimination that they anticipate receiving from others should they contract COVID-19. It is possible that the collectivist nature of Japanese culture coupled with the government’s policy of relying on personal responsibility to combat COVID-19 explains some of the above findings, as the latter has led to the emergence of vigilantes. The presence of mutual surveillance can contribute to growing skepticism toward others as well as fear of ostracism, which may have negative consequences at both the societal and individual levels.","Kawamoto, Tatsuro; Aoki, Takaaki; Ueda, Michiko",PLoS One,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04510v1.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34388225/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256212,136

However, its association with diabetes mellitus (DM) was discussed controversially. Few researchers reviewed the association of these two common morbid disorders. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the relationship between AD and DM. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed including Epub and ahead of print (198 articles identified) and Cochrane (13 articles) databases. The searching engine was set to include case-control, prospective and retrospective cohorts, and cross-sectional studies from the first published up to February 12, 2021. Two hundred and eleven were identified, eighteen full texts were screened; of them, six were included in the final meta-analysis. The keywords used were AD, diabetes mellitus, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes. A datasheet was used to record the author's name, year of publication, country and type of the studies, number of events, and total number in the two arms (patients and controls). Results: Out of the 211 references identified, six studies were pooled to test the association between diabetes mellitus and AD. The studies showed that AD is lower among patients with DM, odds ratio, 0.69, 95% CI, and 0.67-0.72. No heterogeneity was observed (Chi-Square, 4.12, degree of freedom (df.)= 5, and I(2 )= 0%, P-value), 0.53 and P-value for overall effect, <0.001. The included studies were published in Europe (five) and Canada (one study) and included 162,882 patients and 12,164 events, four of the studied articles were case-control studies, one retrospective, and one cross-sectional. Conclusion: AD was lower among patients with DM compared to their counterparts without the disease.

Regulation, typically in the form of incentive based price caps, often applies to aviation infrastructure, such as major airports and air navigation services. At the same time, the demand for aviation infrastructure services is uncertain and subject to external shocks. Two case studies in economic regulation of aviation infrastructure are examined. They cover a period of volatile demand associated with the collapse of a major domestic airline which coincided with the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US. One case study involves the application of price caps to newly privatized airports during 1997–2002. The other case study examines the development of a long term price path for air navigation services over 2002 to 2004. The case studies illustrate the important role played by regulatory design. The paper concludes that the design of the regulatory framework has an important role in ameliorating the risks associated with uncertainty.","Arblaster, Margaret",Journal of Air Transport Management,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32572322/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969971730128X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S096969971730128X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jairtraman.2017.03.007,136

599711,Remote assessment for identifying COVID-19 post-acute care needs,2020-08-30,"Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is the main diagnostic assay used to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory samples. RT-qPCR is performed by specifically targeting the viral genome using complementary oligonucleotides called primers and probes. This approach relies on prior knowledge of the genetic sequence of the target. Viral genetic variants with changes to the primer/probe binding region may reduce the performance of PCR assays and have the potential to cause assay failure. In this work we demonstrate how two single nucleotide variants (SNVs) altered the amplification curve of a diagnostic PCR targeting the Nucleocapsid (N) gene and illustrate how threshold setting can lead to false-negative results even where the variant sequence is amplified. We also describe how in silico analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences available in the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium (COG-UK) and GISAID databases was performed to predict the impact of sequence variation on the performance of 22 published PCR assays. The vast majority of published primer and probe sequences contain sequence mismatches with at least one SARS-CoV-2 lineage. We recommend that visual observation of amplification curves is included as part of laboratory quality procedures, even in high throughput settings where thresholds are set automatically and that in silico analysis is used to monitor the potential impact of new variants on established assays. Ideally comprehensive in silico analysis should be applied to guide selection of highly conserved genomic regions to target with future SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays.","Storey, Nathaniel; Brown, Julianne R; Pereira, Rui P A; O'Sullivan, Denise M; Huggett, Jim F; Williams, Rachel; Breuer, Judith; Harris, Kathryn A",Journal of Clinical Virology Plus,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcvp.2021.100037; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667038021000296?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667038021000296,136

The first autochthonous Italian case of COVID-19 was documented on February 21, 2020. We investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Italy earlier than that date, by analysing 40 composite influent wastewater samples collected - in the framework of other wastewater-based epidemiology projects - between October 2019 and February 2020 from five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in three cities and regions in northern Italy (Milan/Lombardy, Turin/Piedmont and Bologna/Emilia Romagna). Twenty-four additional samples collected in the same WWTPs between September 2018 and June 2019 (i.e. long before the onset of the epidemic) were included as ‘blank’ samples. Viral concentration was performed according to the standard World Health Organization procedure for poliovirus sewage surveillance, with modifications. Molecular analysis was undertaken with both nested RT-PCR and real-rime RT-PCR assays. A total of 15 positive samples were confirmed by both methods. The earliest dates back to 18 December 2019 in Milan and Turin and 29 January 2020 in Bologna. Virus concentration in the samples ranged from below the limit of detection (LOD) to 5.6 × 104 genome copies (g.c.)/L, and most of the samples (23 out of 26) were below the limit of quantification of PCR. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in northern Italy at the end of 2019. Moreover, it was circulating in different geographic regions simultaneously, which changes our previous understanding of the geographical circulation of the virus in Italy. Our study highlights the importance of environmental surveillance as an early warning system, to monitor the levels of virus circulating in the population and identify outbreaks even before cases are notified to the healthcare system.","La Rosa, Giuseppina; Mancini, Pamela; Ferraro, Giusy Bonanno; Veneri, Carolina; Iaconelli, Marcello; Bonadonna, Lucia; Lucentini, Luca; Suffredini, Elisabetta",Science of The Total Environment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720352402?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141711; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835962/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720352402,136

We assessed the association between COVID-19 infection-related pneumonia and proximal deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) in a cohort of patients admitted to our hospital during the European outbreak in the front line of Cremona, Lombardy. In a single-center cross-sectional study, all patients hospitalized for more than 5 days in Internal Medicine Department with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia received 2-point compressive ultrasound assessment (CUS) of the leg vein system during a single day. Ninety-four percent of patients received enoxaparin as standard pharmacological prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism. The presence of DVT was defined as incompressibility of popliteal or common femoral vein. Out of 121 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (mean age 71.8, 66.3% males) hospitalized on March 31st, 70 stayed in hospital for over 5 days and 66 of them underwent CUS of deep venous system of the legs. The presence of asymptomatic DVT was found in 9 patients (13.6%). No symptomatic DVT was found. Patients with DVT showed mean age = 75.7 years, mean D-dimer levels = 4.02 ng/ml and all of them received enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis, except one. Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram confirmed pulmonary embolism in five patients. One every seven patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia, hospitalized for more than 5 days, had asymptomatic proximal DVT and half of them had confirmed PE despite standard pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.

We used a phylodynamics approach to better understand this sub-epidemic by analyzing 270 HIV-1 polymerase (pol) sequences collected from persons diagnosed with HIV/AIDS between 1995 and 2019. Using network analyses at a 1.5% genetic distance threshold (d), we found a large 154-member outbreak cluster composed mostly of persons who inject drugs (PWID) that were predominantly men. At d = 0.5%, which was used to identify more recent transmission, the large cluster dissociated into three clusters of 18, 12, and 7 members, respectively, five dyads, and 107 singletons. Phylogenetic analysis of the Bulgarian sequences with publicly available global sequences showed that CRF01_AE likely originated from multiple Asian countries, with Vietnam as the likely source of the outbreak cluster between 1988 and 1990. Our findings indicate that CRF01_AE was introduced into Bulgaria multiple times since 1988, and infections then rapidly spread among PWID locally with bridging to other risk groups and countries. CRF01_AE continues to spread in Bulgaria as evidenced by the more recent large clusters identified at d = 0.5%, highlighting the importance of public health prevention efforts in the PWID communities.","Alexiev, Ivailo; Campbell, Ellsworth M.; Knyazev, Sergey; Pan, Yi; Grigorova, Lyubomira; Dimitrova, Reneta; Partsuneva, Aleksandra; Gancheva, Anna; Kostadinova, Asya; Seguin-Devaux, Carole; Elenkov, Ivaylo; Yancheva, Nina; Switzer, William M.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13010116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33467166/,136

The consequences of suboptimal adherence in YLWH are increased risk of HIV transmission and a future generation of immunodeficient adults with drug-resistant virus. Methods: The Youth to Telehealth and Texting for Engagement in Care (Y2TEC) study was a pilot randomized crossover trial that examined the feasibility and acceptability of a novel video-counseling series and accompanying text messages aimed at mental health, substance use, and HIV care engagement for YLWH. The intervention consisted of twelve 20–30-min weekly video-counseling sessions focused on identifying and addressing barriers to HIV care, mental health, and substance use challenges. Participants completed quantitative surveys at baseline, 4 months, and 8 months. Feasibility and acceptability were evaluated using prespecified benchmarks. Results: Fifty YLWH aged 18–29 years living in the San Francisco Bay Area were enrolled. Eighty-six percent and 75% of participants were retained at 4 and 8 months, respectively. A total of 455 (76%) video-counseling sessions were completed. In 82% of sessions, participants responded that they strongly agreed/agreed with this statement: “I felt heard, understood, and respected by the counselor.” In 81% of sessions, participants responded that they strongly agreed/agreed with this statement: “Overall, today's session was right for me.” At baseline, among participants reporting mental health challenges, only 10% noted having ever received mental health services, and among those who reported substance use challenges, ∼19% reported ever receiving substance use services. After 4 months of the Y2TEC intervention, participants reported slightly higher ART adherence and HIV knowledge, decreased depression and anxiety, and reduced stigma related to mental health and substance use.

Despite guidelines for hand sanitizer production published by the World Health Organization, many turn to streaming media for instruction. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate hand sanitizer formulations and safety precautions discussed in popular do-it-yourself (DIY) YouTube videos, and to assess the frequency of calls to poison control centers for pediatric hand sanitizer exposure before and after the arrival of COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: The first 100 videos on YouTube with the most views using the search term “DIY hand sanitizer” were evaluated for accuracy compared with the World Health Organization local hand sanitizer production guidelines. The incidence of pediatric hand sanitizer exposure reported to participating U.S. poison control centers from January 2018 through May 2020 was reviewed from the American Association of Poison Control Centers National Poison Data System. The average number of calls between January 2020 and May 2020 was compared, and the average number of calls in March 2020 was compared with March 2019 and March 2018. RESULTS: Of the YouTube videos that met inclusion criteria, 27% discussed the use of at least 96% ethanol or 99.8% isopropyl alcohol, 4.1% incorporated 3% hydrogen peroxide, 82% used glycerol or an alternative humectant, and 4.1% specified the need for distilled or previously boiled water. Most of the videos failed to describe labeling storage containers, 69% of videos encouraged the use of oils or perfumes to enhance hand sanitizer scent, and 2% of videos promoted the use of coloring agents to be more attractive for use among children specifically. There was a significantly increased average number of daily calls to poison control centers regarding unsafe pediatric hand sanitizer exposure since the first confirmed COVID-19 patient in the United States. There was a significantly increased average number of daily calls in March 2020 compared with the previous 2 years.

METHODS: From January 2005 to April 2009, 1836 children (≤15 years old) who had been admitted to Korea University Ansan Hospital were tested for acute respiratory infection. The patients who were positive for an adenovirus infection were enrolled in this study, and their medical records were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Adenoviruses were isolated from 310 patients. The male to female ratio was 1.6:1 and mean age was 32 ± 24 months. Children under 5 years of age had the highest prevalence. In 2007, adenovirus infections occurred endemically throughout the year. The clinical diagnoses were primarily upper respiratory tract infections (45.4%), lower respiratory tract infections (48.1%), and neurologic disease (5.2%). Associated symptoms, signs and laboratory findings included fever (91.9%), cough (83.9%), pharyngeal injection (62.3%), rale (32.6%) and elevated C‐reactive protein (93.9%). The most common radiologic findings were perihilar and peribronchial infiltrates (42.6%). Co‐infections were observed in 29 cases.

A precise profile of the needs of the user has become a vital foundation of the experience of the user. Previous studies mainly rely on self-reporting to understand the subjective attitudes of the App user toward a single App. This research combined questionnaire measurement and behavior analysis to profile the needs of the App user from a broader perspective. Based on the theoretical model of previous research studies, study 1 developed a novel needs questionnaire measurement of a Chinese App user, which showed good reliability and validity. In study 2, authorized App usage data were collected to construct the behavioral needs profile of a Chinese user. The results showed that the primary needs of the Chinese user remained a relatively high consistency between the questionnaire and the behavior data. The questionnaire-based and behavioral data-based needs profiles provide a reference for further personalized user experience design.","Sun, Zaoyi; Xu, Liang; Zhong, Qi; Qian, Xiuying",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.655612; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34220625/,136
606352,The risk of respiratory tract infections and symptoms in psoriasis patients treated with IL-17-pathway inhibiting biologics: A meta-estimate of pivotal trials relevant to decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-05-19,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can spread from symptomatic patients with COVID-19, but also from asymptomatic individuals. Therefore, robust surveillance and timely interventions are essential for the control of virus spread within the community. In this regard the frequency of testing and speed of reporting, but not the test sensitivity alone, play a crucial role. OBJECTIVES: In order to reduce the costs and meet the expanding demands in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2, complementary assays, such as rapid antigen tests, have been developed. Rigorous analysis under varying conditions is required to assess the clinical performance of these tests and to ensure reproducible results. RESULTS: We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of a recently licensed rapid antigen test using 137 clinical samples in two institutions. Test sensitivity was between 88.2–89.6 % when applied to samples with viral loads typically seen in infectious patients. Of 32 rRT-PCR positive samples, 19 demonstrated infectivity in cell culture, and 84 % of these samples were reactive with the antigen test. Seven full-genome sequenced SARS-CoV-2 isolates and SARS-CoV-1 were detected with this antigen test, with no cross-reactivity against other common respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous antigen tests are available for SARS-CoV-2 testing and their performance to detect infectious individuals may vary. Head-to-head comparison along with cell culture testing for infectivity may prove useful to identify better performing antigen tests. The antigen test analyzed in this study is easy-to-use, inexpensive, and scalable. It can be helpful in monitoring infection trends and thus has potential to reduce transmission.","Toptan, Tuna; Eckermann, Lisa; Pfeiffer, Annika E.; Hoehl, Sebastian; Ciesek, Sandra; Drosten, Christian; Corman, Victor M.",J Clin Virol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33352470/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220304558; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220304558,136

It represents the first new dedicated brain stereotactic radiosurgery platform in almost half a century optimizing the goals of safety, speed, and accuracy. The Zap-X system was used in a required Chinese National Medical Products Administration clinical study. In early January 2020, 2 patients were treated with the Zap-X robot prior to a national COVID-19 lockdown. Both were closely followed via clinical exam and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging. Prospectively collected data were used to generate this report. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Two female patients, each harboring either a trigeminal schwannoma or petroclival meningioma, were treated with the Zap-X robot. Respective tumor volumes were 2.60 and 4.02 cm(3). A radiation dose of 13 Gy was prescribed to the 50% isodose line. At 8 mo of follow-up, preoperative symptoms were either resolved or stable and MRI imaging demonstrated a 31% and 56% reduction in lesion volume, respectively. In both patients, symptoms improved, and tumor volumes decreased, whereas no major complication was observed. CONCLUSION: Given only 2 patients and short-term follow-up, any conclusions about the safety and efficacy of the Zap-X radiosurgery robot are preliminary. However, in the absence of any other published outcomes to date, this small case series may be of interest to many radiosurgical specialists.","Pan, Longsheng; Qu, Baolin; Bai, Jingmin; Huang, Lichao; Wang, Jinyuan; Wang, Chengcheng; Dai, Xiangkun; Weidlich, Georg; Adler, John R",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyaa550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33442727/,136

Our aim was to compare the characteristics of S-ICD patients from the multi-center registry of S-ICD implantations in Poland with the published results of the European Snapshot Survey on S-ICD Implantation (ESSS-SICDI). We compared data of 137 Polish S-ICD patients with 68 patients from the ESSS-SICDI registry. The groups did not differ significantly in terms of sex, prevalence of ischemic cardiomyopathy, concomitant diseases, and the rate of primary prevention indication. Polish patients had more advanced heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III: 11.7% vs. 2.9%, NYHA II: 48.9% vs. 29.4%, NYHA I: 39.4% vs. 67.7%, p < 0.05 each). Young age (75.9% vs. 50%, p < 0.05) and no vascular access (7.3% vs. 0%, p < 0.05) were more often indications for S-ICD. The percentage of patients after transvenous system removal due to infections was significantly higher in the Polish group (11% vs. 1.5%, p < 0.05). In the European population, S-ICD was more frequently chosen because of patients’ active lifestyle and patients’ preference (both 10.3% vs. 0%, p < 0.05). Our analysis shows that in Poland, compared to other European countries, subcutaneous cardioverters-defibrillators are being implanted in patients at a more advanced stage of chronic heart failure. The most frequent reason for choosing a subcutaneous system instead of a transvenous ICD is the young age of a patient.","Kempa, Maciej; Przybylski, Andrzej; Budrejko, Szymon; Fabiszak, Tomasz; Lewandowski, Michał; Kaczmarek, Krzysztof; Tajstra, Mateusz; Grabowski, Marcin; Mitkowski, Przemysław; Tubek, Stanisław; Jędrzejczyk-Patej, Ewa; Lenarczyk, Radosław; Jagielski, Dariusz; Romanek, Janusz; Rydlewska, Anna; Orski, Zbigniew; Zakrzewska-Koperska, Joanna; Filipecki, Artur; Janowski, Marcin; Potpara, Tatjana; Boveda, Serge",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18137178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34281115/,136

608611,Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies: To Care or Not to Care,2021-08-11,"Background: The effectiveness of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT) has been proven for mild and moderate anxiety and depression. In 2016, the first official Chinese CCBT system was launched by Chinese Cognitive Behavior Therapy Professional Organizations and included four items: getting out of depression, overcoming anxiety, staying away from insomnia and facing Obsessive-compulsive disorder. During the COVID-19 epidemic, Chinese CCBT system served the public for free. This study explored the effects of CCBT on anxiety and depression by comparing the use of the platform during the epidemic and during the same period in 2019. Methods: Users were divided into a depression group or an anxiety group according to their own discretion. The subjects used the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) before each training. Each training group completed the corresponding CCBT training project, which had 5–6 training sessions, an average of once every 5 days. The training content in 2019 and 2020 was identical. This study compared the demographic characteristics, depression, and anxiety levels of CCBT platform users during the lockdown period in Wuhan (LP2020), where the outbreak was concentrated in China, from January 23 to July 23, 2020 and the same period in 2019 (SP2019). Result: (1) There were significant differences in gender (χ2 = 7.215, P = 0.007), region (χ2 = 4.225, P = 0.040) and duration of illness (χ2 = 7.867, P = 0.049) between the two periods. (2) There was a positive Pearson correlation between the number of users of CCBT platform during LP2020 and number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in each province (r = 0.9429, P < 0.001). (3) In LP2020, the SAS (t = 2.579, P = 0.011) and SDS (t = 2.894, P = 0.004) scores at T0 in Hubei were significantly higher than those in other regions. (4) The CCBT platform has an obvious effect on anxiety (F = 4.74, P = 0.009) and depression on users (F = 4.44, P = 0.009). Conclusion: This study showed women, students and people who are more seriously affected by the epidemic were more likely to accept the CCBT training. The CCBT platform made a significant contribution toward alleviating the anxiety and depression symptoms of users during the epidemic. When face-to-face psychotherapy is not available during the epidemic, CCBT can be used as an effective alternative.","Lv, Zhangwei; Li, Jinyang; Zhang, Bin; Zhang, Ning; Wang, Chun",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.687165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34335402/,136

While NiV has caused less than 700 human cases since its discovery in 1998/1999, the involvement of intermediate agricultural hosts can result in significant economic consequences. Owing to the severity of disease, capacity for human-to-human transmission, zoonotic potential, and lack of available approved therapeutic treatment options, NiV has been listed by the World Health Organization in their Blueprint list of priority pathogens as one of the eight most dangerous pathogens to monitor and prepare countermeasures to prevent a pandemic.

Hitherto, no antiviral drug is available to combat this viral outbreak. METHODS: Keeping in mind the urgency of the situation, the current study was designed to devise new strategies for drug discovery and/or repositioning against SARS-CoV-2. In the current study, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which regulates viral replication, is proposed as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit viral infection. RESULTS: Evolutionary studies of whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 represent high similarity (> 90%) with other SARS viruses. Targeting the RdRp active sites, ASP760 and ASP761, by antiviral drugs could be a potential therapeutic option for inhibition of coronavirus RdRp, and thus viral replication. Target-based virtual screening and molecular docking results show that the antiviral Galidesivir and its structurally similar compounds have shown promise against SARS-CoV-2.

611361,Oral and Maxillofacial Minor Surgery Practice Post-COVID 2019 Pandemic - An Insight,2020-12-23,"Presently, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are broadly adopted in remote monitoring large-scale production systems and modern power grids. However, SCADA systems are continuously exposed to various heterogeneous cyberattacks, making the detection task using the conventional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) very challenging. Furthermore, conventional security solutions, such as firewalls, and antivirus software, are not appropriate for fully protecting SCADA systems because they have distinct specifications. Thus, accurately detecting cyber-attacks in critical SCADA systems is undoubtedly indispensable to enhance their resilience, ensure safe operations, and avoid costly maintenance. The overarching goal of this paper is to detect malicious intrusions that already detoured traditional IDS and firewalls. In this paper, a stacked deep learning method is introduced to identify malicious attacks targeting SCADA systems. Specifically, we investigate the feasibility of a deep learning approach for intrusion detection in SCADA systems. Real data sets from two laboratory-scale SCADA systems, a two-line three-bus power transmission system and a gas pipeline are used to evaluate the proposed method’s performance. The results of this investigation show the satisfying detection performance of the proposed stacked deep learning approach. This study also showed that the proposed approach outperformed the standalone deep learning models and the state-of-the-art algorithms, including Nearest neighbor, Random forests, Naive Bayes, Adaboost, Support Vector Machine, and oneR. Besides detecting the malicious attacks, we also investigate the feature importance of the cyber-attacks detection process using the Random Forest procedure, which helps design more parsimonious models.","Wang, Wu; Harrou, Fouzi; Bouyeddou, Benamar; Senouci, Sidi-Mohammed; Sun, Ying",Cluster Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34629940/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10586-021-03426-w,136

When exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the immune system responds by expressing antibodies at levels that can be detected and monitored to identify the fraction of the population potentially immunized against SARS-CoV-2 and support efforts to deploy a vaccine strategically. A SPR sensor coated with a peptide monolayer and functionalized with various sources of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins expressed in different cell lines detected human anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in clinical samples. Nucleocapsid expressed in different cell lines did not significantly change the sensitivity of the assays, whereas the use of a CHO cell line to express spike ectodomain led to excellent performance. This bioassay was performed on a portable SPR instrument capable of measuring 4 biological samples within 30 minutes of sample/sensor contact and the chip could be regenerated at least 9 times. Multi-site validation was then performed with in-house and commercial ELISA, which revealed excellent cross-correlations with Pearson's coefficients exceeding 0.85 in all cases, for measurements in DBS and plasma.

In this multicenter, nationwide, prospective study, we compared demographics and clinical features, therapeutic management, and outcomes in SOT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Spain before (first wave) or after (second wave) 13 July 2020. RESULTS. Of 1634 SOT recipients, 690 (42.2%) and 944 (57.8%) were diagnosed during the first and second periods, respectively.

Thus this paper aims to: (i) investigate Swedish parents’ experiences regarding feeding of solid foods, screen time, and physical activity in healthy infants; (ii) investigate parents’ needs and perceptions regarding information/support provided in primary child healthcare (CHC) and (iii) explore whether a parenting program focused on child diet and active play would be relevant and utilized. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 parents. These were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. Seven themes emerged: Feeling excited to enter a new phase; Parents’ responsibility of doing it “right” can be stressful; Motivated to learn during specific time windows; Information to trust; The importance of social support from peers; Experiences of support received from CHC; and the Infant, Feeding, Activity, and Nutrition Trial (INFANT) for a Swedish context. Parents were excited to enter new phases in their child’s development. However, this came with worry they were doing things “right”, leading parents to want more information/support.

This systematic process, called the Delphi method, has the potential to produce estimates more quickly and with less bias than might be achieved through expert panel discussions alone. Our case study is a multi-component randomized-controlled trial (RCT) of a workforce policy called MyGoals for Healthy Aging.","Muennig, Peter; McEwen, Bruce; Belsky, Daniel W.; Noble, Kimberly G.; Riccio, James; Manly, Jennifer",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17093028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32349268/,136

We investigated longitudinal peripheral blood samples in 50 individuals with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 20 who experienced prolonged duration of COVID-19 symptoms (lasting more than 30 days; median = 74 days) compared with 30 who had symptom resolution within 20 days. Individuals with prolonged symptom duration maintained antigen-specific T cell response magnitudes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in CD4(+) and circulating T follicular helper cell populations during late convalescence, while those without persistent symptoms demonstrated an expected decline. The prolonged group also displayed increased IgG avidity to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Significant correlations between symptom duration and both SARS-CoV-2–specific T cells and antibodies were observed. Activation and exhaustion markers were evaluated in multiple immune cell types, revealing few phenotypic differences between prolonged and recovered groups, suggesting that prolonged symptom duration is not due to persistent systemic inflammation. These findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2–specific immune responses are maintained in patients suffering from prolonged post–COVID-19 symptom duration in contrast to those with resolved symptoms and may suggest the persistence of viral antigens as an underlying etiology.","Files, Jacob K.; Sarkar, Sanghita; Fram, Tim R.; Boppana, Sushma; Sterrett, Sarah; Qin, Kai; Bansal, Anju; Long, Dustin M.; Sabbaj, Steffanie; Kobie, James J.; Goepfert, Paul A.; Erdmann, Nathan",JCI insight,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.151544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34143754/,136
618040,Pandemic panic and anxiety in developing countries. Embracing One Health offers practical strategies in management of COVID-19 for Africa,2020-04-14,"In the past decade, gold nanoparticles have attracted strong interest from the nanobiotechnological community owing to the significant progress made in robust and easy-to-make synthesis technologies, in surface functionalization, and in promising biomedical applications. These include bioimaging, gene diagnostics, analytical sensing, photothermal treatment of tumors, and targeted delivery of various biomolecular and chemical cargos. For the last-named application, gold nanoparticles should be properly fabricated to deliver the cargo into the targeted cells through effective endocytosis. In this review, we discuss recent progress in understanding the selective penetration of gold nanoparticles into immune cells. The interaction of gold nanoparticles with immune cell receptors is discussed. As distinct from other published reviews, we present a summary of the immunological properties of gold nanoparticles. This review also summarizes what is known about the application of gold nanoparticles as an antigen carrier and adjuvant in immunization for the preparation of antibodies in vivo. For each of the above topics, the basic principles, recent advances, and current challenges are discussed. Thus, this review presents a detailed analysis of data on interaction of gold nanoparticles with immune cells. Emphasis is placed on the systematization of data over production of antibodies by using gold nanoparticles and adjuvant properties of gold nanoparticles. Specifically, we start our discussion with current data on interaction of various gold nanoparticles with immune cells. The next section describes existing technologies to improve production of antibodies in vivo by using gold nanoparticles conjugated with specific ligands. Finally, we describe what is known about adjuvant properties of bare gold or functionalized nanoparticles. In the Conclusion section, we present a short summary of reported data and some challenges and perspectives.","Dykman, Lev A.; Khlebtsov, Nikolai G.",Chem Sci,https://doi.org/10.1039/c6sc03631g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28451297/,136

This study explored the effect of COVID-19 knowledge learning online in a flipped classroom based on micro-learning combined with case-based learning (CBL). METHODS: There were 74 undergraduate medical students who were randomly grouped to an observation group and a control group with 37 participants in each virtual classroom on the Network Teaching Platform. Students learning in the control group utilized face-to-face lecture with PowerPoint pre-provided, while students learning in the observation group were conducted in a flipped classroom based on micro-learning combined with CBL. We compared the effect of both formats of COVID-19 knowledge learning online and the impact on clinical practice attitude in two groups. RESULTS: All 74 students (100%) responded pretest, posttest and retention test, and completed the questionnaire online. Both formats significantly improved COVID-19 knowledge acquisition at the conclusion of online COVID-19 curriculum. Students’ knowledge test scores including total score and scores of five knowledge dimensions of COVID-19 were significantly higher in the observation group than those in the control group (P<0.05). Compared with students in the control group, students in the observation group performed better in retention test and had a significantly more positive clinical practice attitude (P<0.05 in all items). CONCLUSION: A flipped classroom based on micro-learning combined with CBL showed greater effectiveness in COVID-19 knowledge gain in undergraduate medical students and made their attitude toward clinical practice more positive.","Qian, Qiaohui; Yan, Yuzhong; Xue, Fei; Lin, Jie; Zhang, Fengjiao; Zhao, Jiangxia",Adv Med Educ Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34349586/; https://doi.org/10.2147/amep.s294980,136

Aim: The present study has analyzed the trend in alcohol-related intoxications requiring the hospitalization of children, adolescents and young adults aged less than 21 years in Slovenia in the 1999–2018 period. Methods: We performed a retrospective study on patients discharged after hospitalizations due to mental and behavioral disorders due to acute alcohol intoxication (MBDAAI) or hospitalizations due to the toxic effects of alcohol (TEA We considered three groups: children (aged 10–14), adolescents (aged 15–19) and young adults (20–21 years old). Hospitalization rates and time trends were analyzed using joinpoint regression to obtain the annually calculated age- and sex-specific rates and the annual percentage of change (APC). Results: Considering a total of 2912 MBDAAI-hospitalizations, 15–19-year-old subjects showed a significantly higher hospitalization rate compared to the immediately younger and older age groups and a significant increase in hospitalization rates in the period 1999–2011, followed by a significant decrease. Considering 1143 TEA-hospitalizations, we observed a continuous decrease in the hospitalization rates for children and young adults and, conversely, a continuous even if less than significant increase for adolescents aged 15–19. Conclusions: Alcohol consumption in Slovenian children and adolescents is a highly important health concern.

Un contrôle de la glycémie capillaire est ainsi recommandé avant toute administration de 18F-FDG. Nous rapportons une courte série de 3 patients présentant des glycémies capillaires faussement basses en lien avec l’utilisation de gel hydroalcoolique pour le lavage des mains. Les appareils de mesure de glycémie capillaire utilisent une réaction enzymatique pour mesurer la glycémie à partir des produits de dégradation de la goutte de sang déposée sur la bandelette. Trois enzymes principales peuvent être utilisées : glucose oxidase, glucose hexokinase et glucose deshydrogénase (comme dans notre appareil de mesure). Ces enzymes sont conditionnées à l’état sec sur la bandelette et sont donc sensibles aux conditions ambiantes. Le gel hydroalcoolique peut ainsi altérer la mesure. Dans notre série, les glycémies étaient artificiellement abaissées lorsque les patients avaient les mains couvertes de gel hydroalcoolique non séché avec potentiellement deux conséquences : la non détection d’une hyperglycémie ou la fausse hypoglycémie. Pour deux de ces patients, tous deux diabétiques, la question d’un resucrage immédiat et d’un report de TEP avait même été soulevée. Les guides de bonnes pratiques préconisent un lavage et un séchage des mains soigneux avant toute mesure de la glycémie capillaire, voire même l’utilisation de la seconde goutte de sang dans les cas où un bon lavage serait impossible.

However, the longitudinal memory T-cell response up to 8 months post-symptom onset (PSO) according to the severity of illness is unknown. METHODS: We analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy volunteers or patients with COVID-19 who experienced asymptomatic, mild, or severe illness at 2, 5, and 8 months PSO. SARS-CoV-2 spike, nucleocapsid, and membrane protein-stimulated PBMCs were subjected to flow cytometry analysis RESULTS: A total of 24 patients—seven asymptomatic and nine with mild and eight with severe disease—as well as six healthy volunteers were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2-specific OX40 (+)CD137 (+) CD4 (+) T cells and CD69 (+)CD137 (+) CD8 (+) T cells persisted at 8 months PSO. Also, antigen-specific cytokine-producing or polyfunctional CD4 (+) T cells were maintained for up to 8 months PSO. Memory CD4 (+) T-cell responses tended to be greater in patients who had severe illness than in those with mild or asymptomatic disease. CONCLUSIONS: Memory response to SARS-CoV-2, based on the frequency and functionality, persists for 8 months PSO.

Here, the immune effects of two FPV vaccines on horses were compared. IgG was extracted from FPV-immunized horse sera. Equine F(ab′)(2) fragments were obtained from pepsin-digested IgG and then purified by protein-G column chromatography. The results showed that the inactivated FPV oil vaccine was more effective than the inactivated FPV propolis vaccine in helping healthy horses to produce hyper-immune serum. Four methods were tested, among which the optimized octanoic acid-ammonium sulphate precipitation method was proved to be the best process for extracting IgG. The optimal condition for preparing F(ab′)(2) by pepsin digestion was 30 °C for 3.5 h, and the content, purity and recovery of F(ab′)(2) were 8.64 mg/mL, 90.36% and 93.24%, respectively. Our equine immunoglobulin F(ab′)(2) fragments effectively neutralized activity in vitro against FPV, alleviated the clinical symptoms of FPV-infected cats, reduced the viral loads in the intestine and had prophylactic effects in FPV-infected cats. These results indicate that the F(ab′)(2) fragment prepared from inactivated FPV-immunized horses may be used as a prophylactic agent for diseases caused by FPV.","Liu, Jinfeng; Zhang, Zhenjiang; Bai, Anbin; Sha, Yiyu; Ma, Ling; Qin, Shaomin; Chen, Fenglian; Qin, Shuying; Wu, Jianmin",Appl Biochem Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34086256/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12010-021-03591-z,136

629491,Physician Perceptions of Catching COVID-19: Insights from a Global Survey,2021-03-29,"The COVID‐19 pandemic situation has pushed many higher education institutions into a fast‐paced, and mostly unstructured, emergency remote education process. In such an unprecedented context, it is important to understand how technology is mediating the educational process and how teachers and students are experiencing the change brought by the pandemic. This research aims to understand how the learning was mediated by technology during the early stages of the pandemic and how students and teachers experienced this sudden change. Data were collected following a qualitative research design. Thirty in‐depth and semi‐structured interviews (20 students and 10 teachers) were obtained and analysed following a thematic analysis approach. Results provide evidence on the adoption of remote education technologies due to the pandemic with impacts on the education process, ICT platforms usage and personal adaptation. The emergency remote education context led to mixed outcomes regarding the education process. Simultaneously, ICT platforms usage was mostly a positive experience and personal adaptation was mostly a negative experience. These results bring new insights for higher education organizations on actions they could take, such as curating the learning experience with standard, institutional‐wide platforms, appropriate training for students and teachers, and suitable remote evaluation practices. PRACTITIONER NOTES: What is already known about this topic The COVID‐19 pandemic has pushed the world's education environment into an unstructured, emergency remote education process. There is a lack of understanding of how ICT tools mediated learning during pandemic's early stages and how actors experienced this sudden change. In technology‐mediated learning contexts, participant beliefs, knowledge, practices and the environment mutually influence one another and affect the lived experience. What this paper adds The paper identifies and characterizes the educational process, the technological tools used in this new educational setting and personal adaptation of higher education students and teachers during these unprecedented times. The results show the following: an increase in teacher–student interaction (outside classes), new opportunities and content development; difficulties in control evaluation fraud, constraints in attaining the desired learning outcomes and lack of training; resilience to adapt and adopt the new technologies, despite the negative personal experience lived in terms of productivity, motivation, workload and mental health. Implications for practice and/or policy The paper makes evidence‐based recommendations on how higher education institutions can leverage this experience to prepare for future disruptions and increase the use of ICT tools in their regular learning environment.","Oliveira, Gabriella; Grenha Teixeira, Jorge; Torres, Ana; Morais, Carla",Br J Educ Technol,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34219758/,136

As of the mid of November 2020, the disease has affected 220 countries with more than 16 million active cases and 1.3 million deaths worldwide. Males, pregnant women, the elderly, immunosuppressed patients, and those with underlying medical conditions are more vulnerable to the disease than the general healthy population. Unfortunately, no definite treatment is available. Although remdesivir as an antiviral had been approved for use in those above 12 years of age and 40 kg weight group, it has been observed to be ineffective in large-scale SOLIDARITY trials by WHO. Moreover, dexamethasone has been found to increase the recovery rate of ventilated patients; oxygen and inhaled nitric oxide as a vasodilator have been given emergency expanded access. In addition, more than 57 clinical trials are being conducted for the development of the vaccines on various platforms. Two vaccines were found to be significantly promising in phase III results.

Vaccine breakthrough by a highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 strain is a risk to global public health. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs from suspected vaccine breakthrough cases were tested for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) by qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) for Wuhan-Hu1 and alpha variant. Positive samples were then sequenced by Swift Normalase Amplicon Panels to determine the causal variant. GATK (genome analysis toolkit) variants were filtered with allele fraction ≥80 and min read depth 30x. RESULTS: Viral sequencing revealed an infection cluster of 6 vaccinated patients infected with the delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variant.

CONCLUSIONS: Delta variant may pose the highest risk out of any currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, with previously described increased transmissibility over alpha variant and now, possible vaccine breakthrough.

634333,Psychological resilience during COVID-19: a meta-review protocol,2021-06-18,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an economically devastating enteric disease in the swine industry. The virus infects pigs of all ages, but it cause severe clinical disease in neonatal suckling pigs with up to 100% mortality. Currently, available vaccines are not completely effective and feedback methods utilizing PEDV infected material has variable success in preventing reinfection. Comprehensive information on the levels and duration of effector/memory IgA and IgG antibody secreting B cell response in the intestines and lymphoid organs of PEDV-infected sows, and their association with specific antibody levels in clinical samples such as plasma, oral fluid, and feces is important. Therefore, our goal in this study was to quantify PEDV specific IgA and IgG B cell responses in sows at approximately 1 and 6 months post-infection in commercial swine herds, including parity one and higher sows. Our data indicated that evaluation of both PEDV specific IgA and IgG antibody levels in the plasma and oral fluid (but not feces) samples is beneficial in disease diagnosis. PEDV specific B cell response in the intestine and spleen of infected sows decline by 6 months, and this associates with specific antibody levels in the plasma and oral fluid samples; but the virus neutralization titers in plasma remains high beyond 6 months post-infection. In conclusion, in sows infected with PEDV the presence of effector/memory B cell response and strong virus neutralization titers in plasma up to 6 months post-infection, suggests their potential to protect sows from reinfection and provide maternal immunity to neonates, but challenge studies are required to confirm such responses.","Ouyang, Kang; Shyu, Duan-Liang; Dhakal, Santosh; Hiremath, Jagadish; Binjawadagi, Basavaraj; Lakshmanappa, Yashavanth S.; Guo, Rui; Ransburgh, Russell; Bondra, Kathryn M.; Gauger, Phillip; Zhang, Jianqiang; Specht, Terry; Gilbertie, Aaron; Minton, William; Fang, Ying; Renukaradhya, Gourapura J.",Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26667229/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-015-0285-x,136

Human challenge studies involve the intentional infection of research participants and can accelerate or improve vaccine development by rapidly providing estimates of vaccine safety and efficacy. Human challenge studies of low virulence coronaviruses have been done in the past and human challenge studies with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have been proposed. These studies of coronaviruses could provide considerable benefits to public health; for instance, by improving and accelerating vaccine development. However, human challenge studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in particular might be controversial, in part, for ethical reasons. The ethical issues raised by such studies thus warrant early consideration involving, for example, broad consultation with the community. This Personal View provides preliminary analyses of relevant ethical considerations regarding human challenge studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, including the potential benefits to public health and to participants, the risks and uncertainty for participants, and the third-party risks (ie, to research staff and the wider community). We argue that these human challenge studies can reasonably be considered ethically acceptable insofar as such studies are accepted internationally and by the communities in which they are done, can realistically be expected to accelerate or improve vaccine development, have considerable potential to directly benefit participants, are designed to limit and minimise risks to participants, and are done with strict infection control measures to limit and reduce third-party risks.","Jamrozik, Euzebiusz; Selgelid, Michael J",Lancet Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309920304382; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920304382; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30438-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32479747/,136

639870,Predictors of the prolonged recovery period in COVID-19 patients: a cross-sectional study,2021-05-06,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged healthcare systems worldwide over the last few months, and it continues to do so. Although some restrictions are being removed, it is not certain when the pandemic is going to be definitively over. Pandemics can be seen as a highly complex logistic scenario. From this perspective, some of the indications provided for palliative radiotherapy (PRT) during the COVID-19 pandemic could be maintained in the future in settings that limit the possibility of patients achieving symptom relief by radiotherapy. This paper has two aims: (1) to provide a summary of the indications for PRT during the COVID-19 pandemic; since some indications can differ slightly, and to avoid any possible contradictions, an expert panel composed of the Italian Association of Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology (AIRO) and the Palliative Care and Supportive Therapies Working Group (AIRO-palliative) voted by consensus on the summary; (2) to introduce a clinical care model for PRT [endorsed by AIRO and by a spontaneous Italian collaborative network for PRT named “La Rete del Sollievo” (“The Net of Relief”)]. The proposed model, denoted “No cOmpRoMise on quality of life by pALliative radiotherapy” (NORMALITY), is based on an AIRO-palliative consensus-based list of clinical indications for PRT and on practical suggestions regarding the management of patients potentially suitable for PRT but dealing with highly complex logistics scenarios (similar to the ongoing logistics limits due to COVID-19). MATERIAL AND METHODS: First, a summary of the available literature guidelines for PRT published during the COVID-19 pandemic was prepared. A systematic literature search based on the PRISMA approach was performed to retrieve the available literature reporting guideline indications fully or partially focused on PRT. Tables reporting each addressed clinical presentation and respective literature indications were prepared and distributed into two main groups: palliative emergencies and palliative non-emergencies. These summaries were voted in by consensus by selected members of the AIRO and AIRO-palliative panels. Second, based on the summary for palliative indications during the COVID-19 pandemic, a clinical care model to facilitate recruitment and delivery of PRT to patients in complex logistic scenarios was proposed. The summary tables were critically integrated and shuffled according to clinical presentations and then voted on in a second consensus round. Along with the adapted guideline indications, some methods of performing the first triage of patients and facilitating a teleconsultation preliminary to the first in-person visit were developed. RESULTS: After the revision of 161 documents, 13 papers were selected for analysis. From the papers, 19 clinical presentation items were collected; in total, 61 question items were extracted and voted on (i.e., for each presentation, more than one indication was provided from the literature). Two tables summarizing the PRT indications during the COVID-19 pandemic available from the literature (PRT COVID-19 summary tables) were developed: palliative emergencies and palliative non-emergencies. The consensus of the vote by the AIRO panel for the PRT COVID-19 summary was reached. The PRT COVID-19 summary tables for palliative emergencies and palliative non-emergencies were adapted for clinical presentations possibly associated with patients in complex clinical scenarios other than the COVID-19 pandemic. The two new indication tables (i.e., “Normality model of PRT indications”) for both palliative emergencies and palliative non-emergencies were voted on in a second consensus round. The consensus rate was reached and strong. Written forms facilitating two levels of teleconsultation (triage and remote visits) were also developed, both in English and in Italian, to evaluate the patients for possible indications for PRT before scheduling clinical visits. CONCLUSION: We provide a comprehensive summary of the literature guideline indications for PRT during COVID-19 pandemic. We also propose a clinical care model including clinical indications and written forms facilitating two levels of teleconsultation (triage and remote visits) to evaluate the patients for indications of PRT before scheduling clinical visits. The normality model could facilitate the provision of PRT to patients in future complex logistic scenarios.","Cellini, Francesco; Di Franco, Rossella; Manfrida, Stefania; Borzillo, Valentina; Maranzano, Ernesto; Pergolizzi, Stefano; Morganti, Alessio Giuseppe; Fusco, Vincenzo; Deodato, Francesco; Santarelli, Mario; Arcidiacono, Fabio; Rossi, Romina; Reina, Sara; Merlotti, Anna; Jereczek-Fossa, Barbara Alicja; Tozzi, Angelo; Siepe, Giambattista; Cacciola, Alberto; Russi, Elvio; Gambacorta, Maria Antonietta; Scorsetti, Marta; Ricardi, Umberto; Corvò, Renzo; Donato, Vittorio; Muto, Paolo; Valentini, Vincenzo",Radiol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34570309/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-021-01414-z,136

Predictions that the LMR would be overwhelmed by a coming COVID-19 tsunami were felt well before the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic had been declared. And yet, the LMR, excepting Myanmar, has proved surprisingly resilient in keeping COVID-19 contained to mostly sporadic cases. Cumulative case rates (per one million population) for the LMR, including or excluding Myanmar, from January 1 to October 31 2020, are 1,184 and 237, respectively. More telling are the cumulative rates of COVID-19–attributable deaths for the same period of time, 28 per million with and six without Myanmar. Graphics demonstrate a flattening of pandemic curves in the LMR, minus Myanmar, after managing temporally and spatially isolated spikes in case counts, with negligible follow-on community spread. The comparable success of the LMR in averting pandemic disaster can likely be attributed to years of preparedness investments, triggered by avian influenza A (H5N1). Capacity building initiatives applied to COVID-19 containment included virological (influenza-driven) surveillance, laboratory diagnostics, field epidemiology training, and vaccine preparation. The notable achievement of the LMR in averting COVID-19 disaster through to October 31, 2020 can likely be credited to these preparedness measures.","Corwin, Andrew; Plipat, Tanarak; Phetsouvanh, Rattanaxay; Mayxay, Mayfong; Xangsayarath, Phonepadith; Quynh Mai, Le Thi; Oum, Sophal; Kuddus, Md Abdul",Am J Trop Med Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33534744/; https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-1499,136

However, previously published survey data indicated that formal instruction on the correct utilization of PPE is uncommon in medical school curricula, and there is no published guidance about optimal instruction methods. The infectious disease (ID) simulation lab at Oregon Health & Science University filled this need. METHODS: Second- through fourth-year medical students participated in the infection intersession, a 2-week didactic session that students were required to enroll in once during their clinical rotations. As part of the course, students completed the ID simulation lab, during which they were presented with common ID syndromes (suspected tuberculosis, C. difficile colitis, and neutropenic fever) and asked to select the proper PPE prior to interacting with standardized patients. ID physicians acted as the patients and then conducted feedback sessions, which focused on PPE choice, donning and doffing techniques, and ID diagnosis and management principles. RESULTS: More than 500 medical students participated between 2016 and 2020, demonstrating the feasibility of the experience. The average exam scores were above 80%, and the average student evaluation score of the session was 8.9 out of 10, demonstrating acceptability. DISCUSSION: The ID simulation lab allowed students to reinforce didactic teaching about PPE, dispel common misconceptions, and receive real-time feedback from ID clinicians. Availability of the lab and facilitators were limiting factors. Future work will focus on better understanding the efficacy of the sessions.","Villamagna, Angela Holly; Bonura, Erin M.",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33274292/; https://doi.org/10.15766/mep_2374-8265.11031,136

The proposed method uses a developed breath device composed of a nanomaterial-based hybrid sensor array with multiplexed detection capabilities that can detect disease-specific biomarkers from exhaled breath, thus enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis. An exploratory clinical study with this approach was examined in Wuhan, China, during March 2020. The study cohort included 49 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 58 healthy controls, and 33 non-COVID lung infection controls. When applicable, positive COVID-19 patients were sampled twice: during the active disease and after recovery. Discriminant analysis of the obtained signals from the nanomaterial-based sensors achieved very good test discriminations between the different groups. The training and test set data exhibited respectively 94% and 76% accuracy in differentiating patients from controls as well as 90% and 95% accuracy in differentiating between patients with COVID-19 and patients with other lung infections. While further validation studies are needed, the results may serve as a base for technology that would lead to a reduction in the number of unneeded confirmatory tests and lower the burden on hospitals, while allowing individuals a screening solution that can be performed in PoC facilities. The proposed method can be considered as a platform that could be applied for any other disease infection with proper modifications to the artificial intelligence and would therefore be available to serve as a diagnostic tool in case of a new disease outbreak.","Shan, Benjie; Broza, Yoav Y.; Li, Wenjuan; Wang, Yong; Wu, Sihan; Liu, Zhengzheng; Wang, Jiong; Gui, Shuyu; Wang, Lin; Zhang, Zhihong; Liu, Wei; Zhou, Shoubing; Jin, Wei; Zhang, Qianyu; Hu, Dandan; Lin, Lin; Zhang, Qiujun; Li, Wenyu; Wang, Jinquan; Liu, Hu; Pan, Yueyin; Haick, Hossam",ACS Nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c05657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32808759/,136

RESULTS: The 4 tests studied showed high diagnostic performance characteristics for the diagnoses of definite or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection. The best measures were for the Wondfo test: sensitivity (86.59%; 95% CI: 77.26–93.11%), specificity (100%; 90.51–100%), DOR (257; 60–1,008), LR+ (33.43; 4.82–231.85), LR− (0.13; 0.08–0.23), accuracy (90.76%; 84.06–95.29%), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) 0.82. Although considering only the probable SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR−) cases, all the kits studied showed limited values.

Design: Multicenter observational retrospective cohort study. Setting: Greater Paris University hospitals, France. Participants: 12,217 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 between 24 January and 20 May 2020, including 171 patients (1.4%) who received dexamethasone orally or by intravenous perfusion during the visit. Data source: Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Health Data Warehouse. Main outcome measures: The primary endpoint was time to death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received dexamethasone and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusting for sex, age, obesity, current smoking status, any medical condition associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality, and clinical and biological severity of COVID-19 at admission, while stratifying by the need of respiratory support (i.e., oxygen or intubation). The primary analysis was a multivariable Cox model and the secondary analysis used a univariate Cox regression in a matched analytic sample. Results: Among patients who required respiratory support, the end-point event of death occurred in 10 patients (15.9%) who received dexamethasone and 298 patients (26.4%) who did not. In this group of patients, there was a significant association between dexamethasone use and reduced mortality in both the crude, unadjusted analysis (hazard ratio (HR), 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.87, p=0.021) and the adjusted multivariable analysis (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.96, p=0.039). In the sensitivity analysis, the univariate Cox regression model in the matched analytic sample yielded a same tendency, albeit non-significant (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.14, p=0.077). Among patients without respiratory support, the end-point event of death occurred in 14 patients (13.0%) who received dexamethasone and 1,086 patients (10.0%) who did not. In this group of patients, there was no significant association between dexamethasone use and the endpoint. When examining the association between the cumulative dose of dexamethasone received during the visit and the endpoint, we found that the administration of a cumulative dose between 60 mg to 150 mg among patients who required respiratory support was significantly associated with a lower risk of death in the crude, unadjusted analysis (HR, 0.28; SE, 0.58, p=0.028), the adjusted multivariable analysis (HR, 0.24; SE, 0.65, p=0.030), and in the univariate Cox regression model in the matched analytic sample (HR, 0.32; SE, 0.58, p=0.048), whereas no significant association was observed with a different dose. Among patients without respiratory support, there was no significant association between the cumulative dose of dexamethasone and the endpoint in the crude and in the adjusted multivariable analyses. Conclusions: In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, dexamethasone use administered either orally or by intravenous injection at a cumulative dose between 60 mg and 150 mg was associated with decreased mortality among those requiring respiratory support.","Hoertel, N.; Sanchez, M.; Vernet, R.; Beeker, N.; Neuraz, A.; Alvarado, J.; Daniel, C.; Paris, N.; Gramfort, A.; Lemaitre, G.; Salamanca, E.; Bernaux, M.; Bellamine, A.; Burgun, A.; Limosin, F.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218172v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.23.20218172,136

Parenchymal fibrosis, a network pattern of the liver unique to S. japonicum, was associated with infection at the time of ultrasound (OR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.03–1.90) and infection intensity (test for trend, p = 0.002), adjusting for age, sex and year, and more strongly associated with prior infection status and intensity (adjusted OR 1.84, 95% CI: 1.30–2.60; test for trend: p<0.001 respectively), despite prompt treatment of infections. While declines in parenchymal fibrosis over time were statistically significant, only 28% of individuals with severe parenchymal fibrosis (grades 2 or 3) at enrollment reversed to normal or grade 1 within five years. Other liver abnormalities were less consistently associated with S. japonicum infection. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Parenchymal fibrosis is an appropriate measure of S. japonicum morbidity and can document reductions in disease following control efforts. Other ultrasound measures may have limited epidemiological value in regions with similar infection levels. Because severe fibrosis may not reverse quickly following treatment, efforts to reduce exposure to S. japonicum should be considered in combination with treatment to prevent schistosomiasis morbidity.","Carlton, Elizabeth J.; Hsiang, Michelle; Zhang, Yi; Johnson, Sarah; Hubbard, Alan; Spear, Robert C.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20502515/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000685,136
643314,Palliative Care and COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Study of Factors Associated With Infection and Death at an Oncological Palliative Care Reference Center,2021-01-18,"Nervous necrosis virus (NNV) is a ubiquitous pathogen in the aquaculture worldwide. Little is known about the relationship between NNV virus and host cells. Our studies showed that RGNNV infection could induce cell cycle arrest via activation of p53 signaling in cultured host cells. Infection of RGNNV redistributed NPM1, stabilized p53 and inhibited cell proliferation by inducing G1 arrest. RGNNV infection also led to phosphorylation and accumulation of p53 in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, RGNNV infection upregulated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A (p21) and downregulated cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). The expression of genes in the p53 pathway did not change significantly after p53 knockdown by pifithrin-α during RGNNV infection. However, NPM1 knockdown could abrogate RGNNV-induced cell proliferation inhibition, activation of p53 signaling and cell cycle arrest. In addition, RGNNV infection of the cells synchronized in various stages of cell cycle showed that viral genomic RNA and virus titer were higher in the cells released from G1 phase- or S phase-synchronized cells than that in the cells released from the G2 phase-synchronized or asynchronous cells after 18 h p.i. Therefore, our study reveals that RGNNV infection induces the p53-dependent pathway, resulting in a cell cycle arrest at G1 phase in host cells, which might provide a favorable condition for viral replication.","Mai, Weijun; Liu, Hongxiao; Chen, Huiqing; Zhou, Yajing; Chen, Yan",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170218300972; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170218300972; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2018.06.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29940189/,136

This observational retrospective study aims to further investigate the potential pathophysiology through assessing the pattern of microhaemorrhage and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and microhaemorrhage. By comparing with similar patterns of microhaemorrhage in other non-COVID-19 disease, this study aims to propose possible common pathogenic mechanisms. METHODS: A retrospective observational case series was performed identifying all patients with COVID-19 complicated by cerebral microhaemorrhage on MRI. The distribution and number of microhaemorrhages were recorded using the microbleed anatomical scale, and patients’ baseline characteristics and salient test results were also recorded. RESULTS: Cerebral microhaemorrhages were noted to have a predilection for the corpus callosum, the juxtacortical white matter and brainstem. All patients had a preceding period of critical illness with respiratory failure and severe hypoxia necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates a pattern of cerebral microhaemorrhage that is similar to the pattern reported in patients with non-COVID-19 related critical illness and other causes of severe hypoxia. This raises questions regarding whether microhaemorrhage occurs from endothelial dysfunction due the direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection or from the secondary effects of critical illness and hypoxia.","Dixon, Luke; McNamara, Cillian; Gaur, Pritika; Mallon, Dermot; Coughlan, Christopher; Tona, Francesca; Jan, Wajanat; Wilson, Mark; Jones, Brynmor",Stroke Vasc Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33208493/; https://doi.org/10.1136/svn-2020-000652,136

In Higher Education, ethics is taught predominantly through discussion and case study–based teaching formats. At present, however, only little can be said about the adequacy of these teaching methods in attaining complex educational objectives as ethics education poses challenges regarding meaningful student assessment and evaluation of educational methods. Output-oriented evaluation and assessment paradigms that centre quantified student performance fail to meaningfully capture the learning of ethics. Currently, we argue that comparatively small efforts are being devoted to the advancement of innovative and adequate approaches to teaching and assessment in ethics education. In response to these shortcomings, drawing from educational traditions that focus on preparatory activities, we work towards a new approach to evaluate teaching methods and assessing the learning in ethics.","Gille, Felix; Nardo, Aline",J Med Educ Curric Dev,https://doi.org/10.1177/2382120520931059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33062894/,136

Conventional and real-time PCR assays were performed using a heat-block thermocycler ABI 9600, the Roche LightCycler™ version 1.2, or the ABI 7000 Sequence Detection System. The sensitivity of all primers was between 0.0004 and 0.04 PFU with viral cell lysate and between 0.004 and 0.4 PFU in spiked stool specimen per PCR assay. The primer sets for real-time PCR assays were at one least 1 log more sensitive than the primer sets used in the conventional PCR. A panel of viruses including swine gastroenteritis virus, bovine coronavirus, avian bronchitis virus (Connecticut strain), avian bronchitis virus (Massachusetts strain), human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, parainfluenza virus (type III), human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A were tested by all assays. All real-time PCR assays used probe-based detection, and no cross-reactivity was observed. With conventional PCR, analysis was performed using agarose gel electrophoresis and multiple nonspecific bands were observed. Two commercial extraction methods, magnetic particle capture and silica-based procedure were evaluated and the results were comparable. The former was less laborious with shorter time for completion and can easily be adapted to an automated system such as the MagNa Pure-LC, which can extract nucleic acid from clinical samples and load it into the sample capillaries of the LightCycler™.

648627,"COVID-19 pandemic, Uganda’s story",2020-05-27,"Background: Intermountain Healthcare, an early adopter and champion for newborn video-assisted resuscitation (VAR), identified a reduction in facility-level transfers and an estimated savings of $1. 2 million in potentially avoided transfers in a 2018 study. This study was conducted to increase understanding of VAR at the individual, newborn level. Study Aim: To compare transfers to a newborn intensive care unit (NICU), length of stay (LOS), and days of life on oxygen between newborns managed by neonatal VAR and those receiving standard care (SC). Methods: This retrospective, nonequivalent group study includes infants born in an Intermountain hospital between 2013 and 2017, 34 weeks gestation or greater, and requiring oxygen support in the first 15 minutes of life. Data came from billing and clinical records from Intermountain's enterprise data warehouse and chart reviews. We used logistic regression to estimate neonatal VAR's impact on transfers. Negative binomial regression estimated the impact on LOS and days of life on supplemental oxygen. Results: The VAR intervention was used in 46.2 percent of post-implementation cases and is associated with (1) a 12 percentage points reduction in the transfer rate, p = 0.02, (2) a reduction in spoke hospital (SH) LOS of 8.33 h (p < 0.01) for all transfers; (3) a reduction in SH LOS of 2.21 h (p < 0.01) for newborns transferred within 24 h; (4) a reduction in SH LOS of 17.85 h (p = 0.06) among non-transferred newborns; (5) a reduction in days of life on supplemental oxygen of 1.4 days (p = 0.08) among all transferred newborns, and (6) a reduction in days of life on supplemental oxygen of 0.41 days (p = 0.04) among non-transferred newborns. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that neonatal VAR improves care quality and increases local hospitals' capabilities to keep patients close to home. There is an ongoing demand for support to rural and community hospitals for urgent newborn resuscitations, and complex, mandatory NICU transfers. Efforts may be necessary to encourage neonatal VAR since the intervention was only used in 46.2 percent of this study's potential cases. Additional work is needed to understand the short- and long-term impacts of Neonatal VAR on health outcomes.","Maddox, Lory J.; Albritton, Jordan; Morse, Janice; Latendresse, Gwen; Meek, Paula; Minton, Stephen",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33968852/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.648536,136
649901,"Asymptomatic COVID-19 infection: diagnosis, transmission, population characteristics",2021,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Experts have forewarned about the COVID‐19 pandemic environment fomenting the rising incidence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol‐associated liver disease (ALD). We performed a cross‐sectional study of ALD at our liver transplantation (LT) center, located in the initial U.S. epicenter, New York City (NYC). RESULTS: Centered around the “stay at home” order date in NY state, 3/22/20, we defined 3 time periods: “pre‐COVID” (1/1/20‐3/21/20); “COVID‐quarantine” (3/22/20‐4/22/20); and “declining‐COVID” (4/23/20‐8/25/20). We found a 62% increase in interhospital patient transfers for ALD from pre‐COVID (20/93, 21%) to the declining‐COVID period (43/127, 34%). Our inpatient liver census with ALD also increased: 38% pre‐COVID, 45% COVID‐quarantine and 49% declining‐COVID. Among 30 severe AH patients not responding to medical therapy since 3/22/20, 9 underwent early LT for AH (16% of the total number of early LT during our 8‐year program). Three of 9 early LT recipients reported specific COVID‐related stressors. All 25 previous LT recipients with established abstinence pre‐COVID maintained abstinence at follow‐up visits during declining‐COVID period. Of 6 recipients with sustained alcohol use within 6 months before 3/22/20, half regained abstinence during the declining‐COVID period. CONCLUSION: Our findings help confirm the predictions of rising AUD and ALD as an immediate consequence of the COVID‐19 pandemic. This aftershock particularly affected ethnically diverse ALD patients with high inpatient mortality, reflecting the disproportionate impact of COVID‐19 on underserved and minority populations. Alcohol relapse did not occur in long‐term early LT for AH recipients during the time of COVID‐19. This lends further support to AH being a viable indication for LT, with recipients able to demonstrate ongoing resilience in the face of this unprecedented universal stressor.","Rutledge, Stephanie M.; Schiano, Thomas D.; Florman, Sander; Im, Gene Y.",Hepatol Commun,https://doi.org/10.1002/hep4.1706; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34533000/,136

As of April 15, 2020, >1.9 million COVID-19 cases were confirmed worldwide, including >120,000 deaths. There is an urgent need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence to control this spread more effectively. Time series models are significant in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis. In this study, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 prevalence of Italy, Spain, and France, the most affected countries of Europe. The daily prevalence data of COVID-19 from 21 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 were collected from the WHO website. Several ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters. ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) models with the lowest MAPE values (4.7520, 5.8486, and 5.6335) were selected as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19 in the future. The results of the analysis can shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak and give an idea of the epidemiological stage of these regions. Besides, the prediction of COVID-19 prevalence trends of Italy, Spain, and France can help take precautions and policy formulation for this epidemic in other countries.","Ceylan, Zeynep",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360907/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138817; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720323342; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720323342?v=s5,136

We sought to understand the variation in the risk of COVID 19 related death across religious groups in the UK both before and after lockdown. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of usual residents in England and Wales enumerated at the 2011 Census (n = 48,422,583), for risk of death involving COVID-19 using linked death certificates. Cox regression models were estimated to compare risks between religious groups. Time dependent religion coefficients were added to the model allowing hazard ratios (HRs) pre and post lockdown period to be estimated separately. Results Compared to Christians all religious groups had an elevated risk of death involving COVID-19; the largest age adjusted HRs were for Muslim and Jewish males at 2.5 (95% confidence interval 2.3-2.7) and 2.1 (1.9-2.5), respectively. The corresponding HRs for Muslim and Jewish females were 1.9 (1.7-2.1) and 1.5 (1.7-2.1). The difference in risk between groups contracted after lockdown. Those who affiliated with no religion had the lowest risk of COVID 19 related death before and after lockdown. Conclusion The majority of the variation in COVID 19 mortality risk was explained by controlling for socio demographic and geographic determinants; however, Jews remained at a higher risk of death compared to all other groups. Lockdown measures were associated with reduced differences in COVID 19 mortality rates between religious groups, further research is required to understand the causal mechanisms.","Gaughan, C.; Ayoubkhani, D.; Nafilyan, V.; Goldblatt, P.; White, C.; Tingay, K.; Bannister, N.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.01.20204495; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20204495v1?rss=1,136

Here we use a yeast-display system to map all mutations to the viral spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) that escape binding by representatives of three potently neutralizing classes of anti-RBD antibodies with high-resolution structures. We compare the antibody-escape maps to similar maps for convalescent polyclonal plasmas, including plasmas from individuals from whom some of the antibodies were isolated. While the binding of polyclonal plasma antibodies are affected by mutations across multiple RBD epitopes, the plasma-escape maps most resemble those of a single class of antibodies that target an epitope on the RBD that includes site E484. Therefore, although the human immune system can produce antibodies that target diverse RBD epitopes, in practice the polyclonal response to infection is skewed towards a single class of antibodies targeting an epitope that is already undergoing rapid evolution.","Greaney, Allison J.; Starr, Tyler N.; Barnes, Christopher O.; Weisblum, Yiska; Schmidt, Fabian; Caskey, Marina; Gaebler, Christian; Cho, Alice; Agudelo, Marianna; Finkin, Shlomo; Wang, Zijun; Poston, Daniel; Muecksch, Frauke; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Bieniasz, Paul D.; Robbiani, Davide F.; Nussenzweig, Michel C.; Bjorkman, Pamela J.; Bloom, Jesse D.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34234131/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24435-8,136

655727,263 Utilizing Telemedicine in a Novel Approach to COVID-19 Management and Patient Experience in the Emergency Department,2020-10-31,"To mitigate the harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, world countries have resorted - though with different timing and intensities - to a range of interventions. These interventions and their relaxation have shaped the epidemic into a multi-phase form, namely an early invasion phase often followed by a lockdown phase, whose unlocking triggered a second epidemic wave, and so on. In this article, we provide a kinematic description of an epidemic whose time course is subdivided by mitigation interventions into a sequence of phases, on the assumption that interventions are effective enough to prevent the susceptible proportion to largely depart from 100% (or from any other relevant level). By applying this hypothesis to a general SIR epidemic model with age-since-infection and piece-wise constant contact and recovery rates, we supply a unified treatment of this multi-phase epidemic showing how the different phases unfold over time. Subsequently, by exploiting a wide class of infectiousness and recovery kernels allowing reducibility (either to ordinary or delayed differential equations), we investigate in depth a low-dimensional case allowing a non-trivial full analytical treatment also of the transient dynamics connecting the different phases of the epidemic. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results by a fit to the overall Italian COVID-19 epidemic since March 2020 till February 2021 i.e., before the mass vaccination campaign. This show the abilities of the proposed model in effectively describing the entire course of an observed multi-phasic epidemic with a minimal set of data and parameters, and in providing useful insight on a number of aspects including e.g., the inertial phenomena surrounding the switch between different phases.","d’Onofrio, Alberto; Manfredi, Piero; Iannelli, Mimmo",Math Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34302820/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2021.108671; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556421000973?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556421000973,136

SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes two S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases (MTase) which sequentially methylate the RNA cap at guanosine-N7 and ribose 2′-O positions, catalyzed by nsp14 N7-MTase and nsp16 2′-O-MTase, respectively. A unique feature for SARS-CoV is that nsp16 requires non-structural protein nsp10 as a stimulatory factor to execute its MTase activity. Here we report the biochemical characterization of SARS-CoV 2′-O-MTase and the crystal structure of nsp16/nsp10 complex bound with methyl donor SAM. We found that SARS-CoV nsp16 MTase methylated m7GpppA-RNA but not m7GpppG-RNA, which is in contrast with nsp14 MTase that functions in a sequence-independent manner. We demonstrated that nsp10 is required for nsp16 to bind both m7GpppA-RNA substrate and SAM cofactor. Structural analysis revealed that nsp16 possesses the canonical scaffold of MTase and associates with nsp10 at 1∶1 ratio. The structure of the nsp16/nsp10 interaction interface shows that nsp10 may stabilize the SAM-binding pocket and extend the substrate RNA-binding groove of nsp16, consistent with the findings in biochemical assays. These results suggest that nsp16/nsp10 interface may represent a better drug target than the viral MTase active site for developing highly specific anti-coronavirus drugs.","Chen, Yu; Su, Ceyang; Ke, Min; Jin, Xu; Xu, Lirong; Zhang, Zhou; Wu, Andong; Sun, Ying; Yang, Zhouning; Tien, Po; Ahola, Tero; Liang, Yi; Liu, Xinqi; Guo, Deyin",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22022266/,136

These effects include: reduction in platelet aggregation, decreased mast cell degranulation, interference with endolysosomal viral trafficking, regulation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α-driven inflammation and increased melatonin levels, which collectively have a direct antiviral effect, regulate coagulopathy or mitigate cytokine storm, which are known hallmarks of severe COVID-19.","Sukhatme, Vikas P.; Reiersen, Angela M.; Vayttaden, Sharat J.; Sukhatme, Vidula V.",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33959018/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.652688,136
657036,"How the COVID-19 Epidemic Affected Prehospital Emergency Medical Services in Tehran, Iran",2020-09-25,"Gold nanoparticles hold a great promise for both clinical and preclinical applications. The major factors impeding such applications are toxicity of new nanomaterials including e.g., pro-apoptotic activities or inflammatory effects, but also their potential to accumulate in the body or inadequate absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) profiles. Since such adverse effects depend on the size, form and coating of nanomaterials, the search for new, less toxic nanomaterials with low tendency to accumulate is highly active domain of research. Here, we describe optical and biological properties of Au18 gold nanoclusters (NCs), small gold nanoparticles composed of 18 atoms of gold and stabilized with glutathione ligands. These nanoclusters may be suitable for in vivo applications owing to their low toxicity and biodistribution profile. Specifically, using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) test in P19 cell line we found that Au18 NCs display low toxicity in vitro. Importantly, using primary microglial cells we showed that at low concentrations Au18 NCs display anti-inflammatory signaling on evidence of reduced interleukin 1-β (IL1-β) levels and unchanged levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) or Ym1/2. Such effect was dose dependent as higher concentrations of Au18 NCs induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppression of anti-inflammatory cytokine Ym1/2, pointing, thus, to global inflammatory activity. Finally, we also showed that within 3 days Au18 NCs can be completely eliminated from the liver reported as the major target organ for accumulation of gold nanoparticles. These data point to a potential of gold nanoparticles for further biomedical studies.","Sobska, Joanna; Waszkielewicz, Magdalena; Podleśny-Drabiniok, Anna; Olesiak-Banska, Joanna; Krężel, Wojciech; Matczyszyn, Katarzyna",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33919336/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11051066,136
657097,Medical Students in the Time of COVID-19,2020-08-19,"There were an estimated 10 million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) disease in 2019. While over 90% of individuals successfully control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, which causes TB disease, HIV co-infection often leads to active TB disease. Despite the co-endemic nature of HIV and TB, knowledge of the immune mechanisms contributing to the loss of control of Mtb replication during HIV infection is lacking. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are innate-like T cells that target and destroy bacterially-infected cells and may contribute to the control of Mtb infection. Studies examining MAIT cells in human Mtb infection are commonly performed using peripheral blood samples. However, because Mtb infection occurs primarily in lung tissue and lung-associated lymph nodes, these studies may not be fully translatable to the tissues. Additionally, studies longitudinally examining MAIT cell dynamics during HIV/Mtb co-infection are rare, and lung and lymph node tissue samples from HIV+ patients are typically unavailable. Nonhuman primates (NHP) provide a model system to characterize MAIT cell activity during Mtb infection, both in Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV)-infected and SIV-naïve animals. Using NHPs allows for a more comprehensive understanding of tissue-based MAIT cell dynamics during infection with both pathogens. NHP SIV and Mtb infection is similar to human HIV and Mtb infection, and MAIT cells are phenotypically similar in humans and NHPs. Here, we discuss current knowledge surrounding MAIT cells in SIV and Mtb infection, how SIV infection impairs MAIT cell function during Mtb co-infection, and knowledge gaps to address.","Moriarty, Ryan V.; Ellis, Amy L.; O’Connor, Shelby L.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13050863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34066765/,136
657580,Association of Health Care Factors With Excess Deaths Not Assigned to COVID-19 in the US,2021-09-13,"Angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) and its homologue angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are critical counter‐regulatory enzymes of the renin–angiotensin system, and have been implicated in cardiac function, renal disease, diabetes, atherosclerosis and acute lung injury. Both ACE and ACE2 have catalytic activity that is chloride sensitive and is caused by the presence of the CL1 and CL2 chloride‐binding sites in ACE and the CL1 site in ACE2. The chloride regulation of activity is also substrate dependent. Site‐directed mutagenesis was employed to elucidate which of the CL1 and CL2 site residues are responsible for chloride sensitivity. The CL1 site residues Arg186, Trp279 and Arg489 of testicular ACE and the equivalent ACE2 residues Arg169, Trp271 and Lys481 were found to be critical to chloride sensitivity. Arg522 of testicular ACE was also confirmed to be vital to the chloride regulation mediated by the CL2 site. In addition, Arg514 of ACE2 was identified as a residue critical to substrate selectivity, with the R514Q mutant, relative to the wild‐type, possessing a fourfold greater selectivity for the formation of the vasodilator angiotensin‐(1–7) from the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. The enhancement of angiotensin II cleavage by R514Q ACE2 was a result of a 2.5‐fold increase in V (max) compared with the wild‐type. Inhibition of ACE2 was also found to be chloride sensitive, as for testicular ACE, with residues Arg169 and Arg514 of ACE2 identified as influencing the potency of the ACE2‐specific inhibitor MLN‐4760. Consequently, important insights into the chloride sensitivity, substrate selectivity and inhibition of testicular ACE and ACE2 were elucidated.","Rushworth, Christopher A.; Guy, Jodie L.; Turner, Anthony J.",FEBS J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19021774/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06733.x,136

Since the first case was confirmed on 20 January 2020, South Korea has been actively experiencing the COVID-19 outbreak. In the early stage of the pandemic, South Korea was one of the most-affected countries because of a large outbreak related to meetings of a religious movement, namely the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, in a city called Daegu and North Gyeongsang province. However, South Korea was held as a model for many other countries as it appeared to slow the spread of the outbreak with distinctive approaches and interventions. First of all, with drastic and early intervention strategies it conducted massive tracing and testing in a combination of case isolation. These measures were underpinned by transparent risk communication, civil society mobilization, improvement of accessibility and affordability of the treatment and test, the consistent public message on the potential benefit of wearing a mask, and innovation. Innovative measures include the mobile case-tracing application, mobile self-quarantine safety protection application, mobile self-diagnosis application, and drive-thru screening centres. Meanwhile, the epidemic has brought enormous impacts on society economically and socially. Given its relationship with China, where the outbreak originated, the economic impact in South Korea was predicted to be intense and it was already observed since February due to a decline in exports. The pandemic and measures undertaken by the government also have resulted in social conflicts and debates, human-right concerns, and political tension. Moreover, it was believed that the outbreak of COVID-19 and the governmental responses towards it has brought a huge impact on the general election in April. Despite of the large outbreak in late February, the Korean government has flattened the COVID-19 curve successfully and the downward trend in the number of new cases remained continuously as of 30 April. The most distinctive feature of South Korea’s responses is that South Korea conducted proactive case finding, contacts tracing, and isolations of cases instead of taking traditional measures of the containment of the epidemic such as boarder closures and lockdowns.","Jeong, Eunsun; Hagose, Munire; Jung, Hyungul; Ki, Moran; Flahault, Antoine",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17249571; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33371309/,136

The disease presents as severe respiratory infection often with shock, acute kidney injury, and coagulopathy. Recently, we observed three cases who presented with neurologic symptoms. These are so far the first reported cases of neurologic injury associated with MERS-CoV infection. METHODS: Data was retrospectively collected from three patients admitted with MERS-CoV infection to Intensive Care unit (ICU) at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh. They were managed separately in three different wards prior to their admission to ICU. FINDING: The three patients presented with severe neurologic syndrome which included altered level of consciousness ranging from confusion to coma, ataxia, and focal motor deficit. Brain MRI revealed striking changes characterized by widespread, bilateral hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted imaging within the white matter and subcortical areas of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, the basal ganglia, and corpus callosum. None of the lesions showed gadolinium enhancement. INTERPRETATION: CNS involvement should be considered in patients with MERS-CoV and progressive neurological disease, and further elucidation of the pathophysiology of this virus is needed.

The goal of this consensus statement is to examine the current evidence for performing tracheostomy in patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 and offer guidance to physicians on the preparation, timing and technique while minimizing the risk of infection to health care workers (HCW). Methods A panel comprised of intensivists and interventional pulmonologists from three professional societies representing 13 institutions with experience in managing COVID-19 patients across a spectrum of healthcare environments developed key clinical questions addressing specific topics on tracheostomy in COVID-19. A systematic review of the literature and an established modified Delphi consensus methodology were applied to provide a reliable evidenced based consensus statement and expert panel report. Results Eight key questions, corresponding to 14 decision points, were rated by the panel. The results were aggregated, resulting in eight main recommendations and five additional remarks intended to guide health care providers in the decision-making process pertinent to tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 related respiratory failure. Conclusion This panel suggests performing tracheostomy in patients expected to require prolonged mechanical ventilation. A specific timing of tracheostomy cannot be recommended. There is no evidence for routine repeat RT- PCR testing in patients with confirmed Covid-19 evaluated for tracheostomy. To reduce the risk of infection in HCW, we recommend performing the procedure using techniques that minimize aerosolization while wearing enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE). The recommendations presented in this statement may change as more experience is gained during this pandemic.","Lamb, Carla R.; Desai, Neeraj R.; Angel, Luis; Chaddha, Udit; Sachdeva, Ashutosh; Sethi, Sonali; Bencheqroun, Hassan; Mehta, Hiren; Akulian, Jason; Argento, A.

The marked heterogeneity in population density and the very extensive geography of the country becomes a challenge itself. Standard compartment models fail when they are implemented in the Argentina case. We extended a previous successful model to describe the geographical spread of the AH1N1 influenza epidemic of 2009 in two essential ways: we added a stochastic local mobility mechanism, and we introduced a new compartment in order to take into account the isolation of infected asymptomatic detected people. Two fundamental parameters drive the dynamics: the time elapsed between contagious and isolation of infected individuals ([Formula: see text] ) and the ratio of people isolated over the total infected ones (p). The evolution is more sensitive to the [Formula: see text] parameter. The model not only reproduces the real data but also predicts the second wave before the former vanishes. This effect is intrinsic of extensive countries with heterogeneous population density and interconnection.The model presented has proven to be a reliable predictor of the effects of public policies as, for instance, the unavoidable vaccination campaigns starting at present in the world an particularly in Argentina.","Barreiro, N.

To support research during the pandemic, the FDA released guidelines promoting the use of “alternative methods” to conduct trials in a virtual or decentralized manner. Currently, few data exist regarding the impact of virtual trial enrollment during a pandemic. This abstract presents data from a decentralized, open-label, single-arm real-world clinical trial of the Somryst prescription digital therapeutic for insomnia, which provides insight on who seeks care for insomnia using virtual research methods. METHODS: In alignment with FDA guidance, the DREAM trial began enrolling patients in March, 2020 with an expected final sample size of 350 adults (Clinical Trial # NCT04325464). This abstract presents data from participants seeking enrollment into the trial via an online screening. Demographic and sleep variables were collected to confirm eligibility. RESULTS: Of 1,063 respondents, the majority were female (62%) and the most common age brackets were ages 30–39 (22%); 40–49 (20%); and 50–59 (20%). Most respondents (63.8%) did not report being under the care of a healthcare provider for their insomnia. Respondents reported sleep problems for an average of 12.9 years; sleep problems 5 nights/week; and sleeping an average of 5.4 hours/night. Geographic diversity was high with respondents from 45 states and Washington DC. Of those passing initial screening (N=270), 5.5% reported having another diagnosed sleep disorder, 14.4% reported a comorbid psychological condition, 58.9% reported taking a medication for insomnia, and 30.7% reported taking a medication for depression. Using the Insomnia Severity Index, 16.7% had subthreshold/mild insomnia (score 8–14), 60.0% had moderate insomnia (score 15–21), and 23.7% had severe insomnia (score > 21). CONCLUSION: Respondents to this decentralized trial reported moderate-severe, long-lasting insomnia with high rates of medication use for sleep and depression. Results demonstrate that virtual trials can quickly draw a highly geographically diverse research population, overcoming logistical challenges inherent in a pandemic and resulting in recruiting appropriate, but more geographically diverse, samples than those typically observed in randomized trials of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I).

However, its shortfall response to visible light, and the expeditious recombination rate of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, hampers its utilization. Doping TiO(2) semiconductor with silver nanoparticles is a sound strategy to (1) extend its photocatalytic activity to visible light, (2) prevent the electron/holes pairs recombination due to the formation of the Schottky barrier at the interfaces with TiO(2) that act as an electron-trapping center, and (3) enhance its bactericide performances. This review focuses on the recent progress on silver-doped titanium dioxide (Ag/TiO(2))-based photocatalysts.

A close homologue of DC‐SIGNR, dendritic‐cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3‐grabbing non‐integrin, has been shown to act as a recycling endocytic receptor, which binds pathogens at the cell's surface and then releases them in the low pH environment of endosomal compartments. However, it is currently under debate in the literature as to whether DC‐SIGNR plays a similar role. In this work, we used NMR to explore whether the DC‐SIGNR carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) shows any pH dependence in its ability to bind carbohydrates and Ca(2+). We found clear evidence of reduced or abolished CRD‐binding affinities for three different glycans at low pH (4.2) as compared to neutral pH (6.8). We also report the assignment of the DC‐SIGNR CRD in the apo form, and use these new results to characterize the degree of structural rearrangement upon binding (or release) of Ca(2+). Finally, we report a differential effect of pH on the affinities of glycans containing mannose exclusively versus glycans containing GlcNAc moieties. Our results lead us to propose that the DC‐SIGNR CRD rapidly and reversibly releases glycan ligands and Ca(2+) at reduced pH (behaviour that would be expected for an endocytic receptor), and that the binding of mannose‐containing oligosaccharides is more strongly affected by pH than the binding of GlcNAc‐containing oligosaccharides.","Probert, Fay; Mitchell, Daniel A.; Dixon, Ann M.",FEBS J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24976257/; https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.12899,136

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibodies against Stx2 obtained from egg yolks of laying hens immunized with a recombinant Stx2B subunit. A high specific response in serum was observed 25 days after the first immunization and IgY antibodies were extracted from day 47th and purified from egg yolk. A concentration of 0.84 mg of total IgY/ml of egg yolk was obtained, of which 8% were antigen specific. The ability of anti-Stx2B IgY to recognize Stx2B and Stx2 either in solid-phase or in solution were evaluated and compared with anti-Stx2B rabbit antibodies by Western blotting and ELISA. The protective efficacy of IgY against Stx2 was determined by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The results show that IgY was able to recognize Stx2B and Stx2 in denatured conditions, attached to a solid-phase and free in solution. The anti-Stx2B IgY could effectively block the biological activity of Stx2 on Vero cells and protect mice from Stx2 challenge. The data suggest that immunization of hens with Stx2B could be a strategy to obtain at low cost a relatively high concentration of anti-Stx2 egg yolk IgY, able to neutralize Stx2 lethal activity. IgY technology could be an useful tool for research, diagnosis and therapy of EHEC infection.","Parma, Y.R.; Chacana, P.A.; Rogé, A.; Kahl, A.; Cangelosi, A.; Geoghegan, P.; Lucchesi, P.M.A.; Fernández-Miyakawa, M.E.",Toxicon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2011.07.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041010111002273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21803069/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041010111002273,136

However, clinical applications of mRNA are limited by its fast degradation by nucleases, and the activation of detrimental immune responses. Advances in mRNA applications, with the recent approval of COVID-19 vaccines, were fueled by optimization of the mRNA sequence and the development of mRNA delivery systems. Although delivery systems and mRNA sequence optimization have been abundantly reviewed, understanding of the intracellular processing of mRNA is mandatory to improve its applications. We will focus on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as they are the most advanced nanocarriers for the delivery of mRNA. Here, we will review how mRNA therapeutic potency can be affected by its interactions with cellular proteins and intracellular distribution.","Delehedde, Christophe; Even, Luc; Midoux, Patrick; Pichon, Chantal; Perche, Federico",Pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13070945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34202584/,136
675694,Emerging evidence on effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines among residents of long-term care facilities,2021-05-25,"Historically, few publications exist where patient engagement in clinical studies is a driving force in study design and implementation. The Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), established in 2010, employed a new model of integrating stakeholder perspectives into healthcare research. This manuscript aims to share the experience of a Patient Engagement Group (PEG) that has engaged in hepatitis C (HCV) clinical research alongside investigators conducting two studies funded by PCORI and to inspire others to get more involved in research that can impact our healthcare and health policies. There are many gaps in treating infectious diseases. Traditionally, treatment and research have been strictly clinical/medical approaches with little focus on the biopsychosocial aspects of individual patients. Our PEG reflected on its own personal experiences regarding how research design can affect study implementation by including patients who are normally excluded. We considered barriers to treatment, out of pocket costs, access to insurance, and patient race/ethnicity. Common themes were discovered, and four major topics were discussed. In addition, measures used in the two studies to collect patient data were considered, tested, and implemented by the group. We describe in detail how we were formed and how we have worked together with researchers on two PCORI funded projects over the past 7 years. We formulated and implemented guidelines and responsibilities for operating as a PEG as well as appointing a chair, co-chair, and primary author of this manuscript. Written from the perspective of a PEG whose members experienced HCV treatment and cure, we provide lessons learned, and implications for further research to include patients. PEGs like ours who are included as active partners in research can provide useful input to many areas including how patients are treated during clinical trials, how they interact with research teams, and how the clinical benefits of drugs or devices are defined and evaluated. PCORI believes engagement impacts research to be more patient-centered, useful, and trustworthy, and will ultimately lead to greater use and interest of research results by the patient and the broader healthcare community.","Kixmiller, Scott; Sloan, Anquenette P.; Wadsworth, Summer; Brown, Finton; Chaney, Lourdes; Houston, Larry; Thomas, Kim",Res Involv Engagem,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40900-021-00249-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33494839/,136

Thus, n-DFL provides a consolidated logical strategy for applied technologies since the ordered evaluations provided by decision makers impact not only by selecting the best solutions for a decision making problem, but also by enabling their comparisons. In such context, this paper studies the n-dimensional fuzzy implications (n-DI) following distinct approaches: (i) analytical studies, presenting the most desirable properties as neutrality, ordering, (contra-)symmetry, exchange and identity principles, discussing their interrelations and exemplifications; (ii) algebraic aspects mainly related to left- and right-continuity of representable n-dimensional fuzzy t-conorms; and (iii) generating n-DI from existing fuzzy implications. As the most relevant contribution, the prospective studies in the class of n-dimensional interval (S,N)-implications include results obtained from t-representable n-dimensional conorms and involutive n-dimensional fuzzy negations. And, these theoretical results are applied to model approximate reasoning of inference schemes, dealing with based-rule in n-dimensional interval fuzzy systems.

The main clinical manifestation of COVID‐19 is the presence of respiratory symptoms, but some patients develop severe cardiovascular and renal complications. There is an urgency to understand the mechanism by which this virus causes complications so as to develop treatment options. Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound, could be a potential treatment option for patients with coronavirus disease. In this study, we review some of the potential effects of curcumin such as inhibiting the entry of virus to the cell, inhibiting encapsulation of the virus and viral protease as well as modulating various cellular signaling pathways. This review provides a basis for further research and development of clinical applications of curcumin for the treatment of newly emerged SARS‐CoV‐2. This article is protected by copyright.

As the scientific community has looked for vaccines and drugs to treat or eliminate the virus, unexpected features of the disease have emerged. Apart from respiratory complications, cardiovascular disease has emerged as a major indicator of poor prognosis in COVID-19. It has therefore become of utmost importance to understand how SARS-CoV-2 damages the heart. Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) cardiovascular derivatives were rapidly recognized as an invaluable tool to address this, not least because one of the major receptors for the virus is not recognized by SARS-CoV-2 in mice. Here, we outline how hPSC-derived cardiovascular cells have been utilized to study COVID-19, and their potential for further understanding the cardiac pathology and in therapeutic development.","Yiangou, Loukia; Davis, Richard P.; Mummery, Christine L.",Stem Cell Reports,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213671120304513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33306986/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213671120304513; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2020.11.003,136

Galectin-3 was implicated in innate immunological response to infections and in chronic fibrosis. The aim of our preliminary study was the assessment of the diagnostic utility of serum galectin-3 in patients with COVID-19. The prospective observational study included adult patients admitted with active COVID-19 and treated in tertiary hospital between June and July 2020. The diagnosis was confirmed by the quantitative detection of nucleic acid of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in nasopharyngeal swabs. Galectin-3 was measured by enzyme immunoassay in serum samples obtained during the first five days of hospital stay. We included 70 patients aged 25 to 73 years; 90% had at least one comorbidity. During the hospital stay, 32.9% were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and 12.9% required treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU). Serum galectin-3 was significantly increased in patients who developed pneumonia, particularly those who required ICU admission. Positive correlations were found between galectin-3 and inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, ferritin, pentraxin-3), a marker of endothelial injury (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1), and a range of tissue injury markers. Serum galectin-3 enabled the diagnosis of pneumonia with moderate diagnostic accuracy and the need for ICU treatment with high diagnostic accuracy. Our findings strengthen the hypothesis that galectin-3 may be involved in severe COVID-19. Further studies are planned to confirm the preliminary results and to verify possible associations of galectin-3 with long-term consequences of COVID-19, including pulmonary fibrosis.","Kuśnierz-Cabala, Beata; Maziarz, Barbara; Dumnicka, Paulina; Dembiński, Marcin; Kapusta, Maria; Bociąga-Jasik, Monika; Winiarski, Marek; Garlicki, Aleksander; Grodzicki, Tomasz; Kukla, Michał",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439802/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11081136,136

We carry out a randomized field experiment in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, in which we provide an information brief about COVID-19 by phone to a random subsample of participants to address stigma and misconceptions. We find that the information brief decreases stigmatization of COVID-19 patients and certain groups such as religious minorities, lower-caste groups, and frontline workers (healthcare, police), and reduces the belief that infection cases are more prevalent among certain marginalized social and economic groups (Muslims, low caste, rural-poor population). We provide suggestive evidence that improved knowledge about the prevention and transmission of COVID-19 and reduced stress about the disease are important channels for the reduction in stigmatization.","Islam, Asad; Pakrashi, Debayan; Vlassopoulos, Michael; Wang, Liang Choon",Soc Sci Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33940435/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113966; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953621002987; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953621002987?v=s5,136

The aim of the study was to explore perceptions on usability and relevance of the app in order to maximise user engagement and sustainability. Using the theory- and evidence-informed person-based approach, initial planning included a scoping review of qualitative evidence to identify barriers and facilitators to use of digital interventions in people with cardiovascular conditions and two focus groups exploring experiences and support needs of people (N = 32) with a history of TIA or minor stroke. The scoping review and focus group data were analysed thematically and findings were used to produce guiding principles, a behavioural analysis and explanatory logic model for the intervention. Optimisation included an additional focus group (N = 12) and individual think-aloud interviews (N = 8) to explore perspectives on content and usability of a prototype app. Overall, thematic analysis highlighted uncertainty about increasing physical activity and concerns that fatigue might limit participation. Realistic goals and progressive increases in activity were seen as important to improving self-confidence and personal control. The app was seen as a useful and flexible resource. Participant feedback from the optimisation phase was used to make modifications to the app to maximise engagement, including simplification of the goal setting and daily data entry sections.

The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in residents’ awareness about COVID-19 and to characterize those who were more aware and responsive during the early stages of the pandemic in Louisiana. METHODS: In response to the mounting threat of COVID-19, we added questions to an ongoing food preference study held at Louisiana State University from March 3rd through March 12th, 2020. We asked how likely it was that the spread of the coronavirus will cause a national public health crisis and participants’ level of concern about contracting COVID-19 by attending campus events. We used regression and classification tree analysis to identify correlations between these responses and (a) national and local COVID case counts; (b) personal characteristics and (c) randomly assigned information treatments provided as part of the food preference study. RESULTS: We found participants expressed a higher likelihood of an impending national crisis as the number of national and local confirmed cases increased. However, concerns about contracting COVID-19 by attending campus events rose more slowly in response to the increasing national and local confirmed case count. By the end of this study on March 12th, 2020 although 89% of participants agreed that COVID-19 would likely cause a public health crisis, only 65% of the participants expressed concerns about contracting COVID-19 from event attendance. These participants were significantly more likely to be younger students, in the highest income group, and to have participated in the study by responding to same-day, in-person flyer distribution. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide initial insights about the perceptions of the COVID-19 public health crisis during its early stages in Louisiana.

Recently, the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia reported a substantial increase in MERS cases, primarily from the Riyadh region. The objective of the present study was to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practices towards MERS among physicians, nurses, pharmacist and technicians individually. METHODS: A cross sectional study conducted at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia among individual healthcare workers. The survey questionnaire was self-administrated and consisted of five sections: Demographic; Source of MERS information; Knowledge; Attitude; and Practice of healthcare workers towards MERS. RESULTS: A total of 391 participants of which physicians (162; 41.4%), pharmacists (18; 4.6%), nurses (130; 33.3%) and technicians (81; 20.7%) were included with a response rate of 95.71%. The majority of the participants were female (53.70%) and mostly in the nurse’s category (40.5%). The participants reported the highest main source of information was seminars and workshops (n = 191; 48%) followed by social media (n = 179; 45%). The overall score indicates good knowledge among physicians (95.7%), pharmacists (88.9%), nurses (86.2%) and technicians (91.4%) and showed statistically significant (p = 0.039). The study showed a positive attitude among physicians (96.3%), pharmacist (94.4%), nurses (94.6%) and technicians (90.1%) with no statistically significant (p = 0.273). However, the majority of the participants showed average practices towards MERS. However, the least practice among participants was the use of facemask in the crowds (24.2%). The demographic characteristic’s age, gender and professions showed significantly associated with mean knowledge score. Similarly, statistical significance observed in gender and experience demographic variables with a mean attitude score. CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that different health workers showed good knowledge and positive attitudes, but low to average practices towards MERS with low adherence to facemask practice. When comparing workers, physicians have a high degree of knowledge and attitude when compared to nurses, pharmacist and technicians.","Albarrak, Ahmed I.; Mohammed, Rafiuddin; Al Elayan, Ali; Al Fawaz, Feras; Al Masry, Musab; Al Shammari, Mohammed; Miaygil, Saud Bin",J Infect Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2019.06.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31431424/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034119302394; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034119302394,136

The two keywords of “antibiotic resistance” and “Escherichia coli” were selected to search in the Scopus database. Each review article was categorized into materials, natural waters (i.e., seawater, freshwater) and wastewater, journal name, and quartile in category of the journal, the year of publication, and the country. Bibliometric indicators and visualization maps were utilized to analyse the retrieved data quantitatively and qualitatively. A total of 1376 publications in the field of agricultural and biological sciences over the last 5 years were obtained using the keywords of antibiotic resistance and Escherichia coli.

It is known that wearing PPE, and specifically face masks, has physcial consequences like headache and pain, which can increase stress among nursing staff. However, none of these studies placed a focus on PPE and nursing staff, although nurses are the only members of the health care profession who are at the patients bedsides 24/7, and PPE is the only way to protect them from a COVID-19 infection. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the association between the use of PPE and stress among nursing staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An online, cross-sectional survey was conducted, which we distributed using snowball sampling techniques. The questionnaire was developed on the basis of (inter-)national recommendations as well as the international literature. We used the perceived level of stress scale to measure the nursing staff members stress levels. Results We included data collected from 2600 nurses in this analysis. Nearly all nursing staff wore face masks. We showed that more than two-thirds of the nurses had moderate to high levels of stress. No statistically significant association between the use of PPE and stress was detected. However, we show a statistically significant association between the duration of mask usage and stress. Discussion and conclusions Nearly all participating nurses wore face masks or FFP masks to protect themselves from COVID-19 infection. This observation might indicate that Austrian nurses display a high level of compliance with national and international regulations and play a key role in such pandemics. Our results also show that increased mask-wearing time led to increased stress levels. These results suggest that (inter-)national regulations on how and when to use PPE should include a maximum duration of time for wearing each type of mask. Such regulations could help to prevent work-related stress, particularly in the case of future epidemics, and avoid burnout among nursing staff or even nurses leaving their jobs. The consequences of both of these negative outcomes should be considered in light of the predicted expected future shortage of health care workers.","Hoedl, Manuela; Eglseer, Doris; Bauer, Silvia",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.06.20164129; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.06.20164129v1?rss=1,136

Chronic liver disease patients co-infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exhibited overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors and overwhelming cytokine storm. Consensus has been reached that we should encourage as many people as possible to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines can prevent or alleviate severe infection and cytokine storm. It is recommended that all adult patients with chronic liver diseases and liver transplant recipients should receive COVID-19 vaccines using the standard dose and schedule. Data is not yet sufficient to compare the efficacy of different types of vaccines used in chronic liver disease patients.","Chen, Li-Ping; Zeng, Qing-Hong; Gong, Yuan-Feng; Liang, Fa-Liang",World J Clin Cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i26.7959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34621852/,136

It is imperative that nations formulate administrative policies based on the changing economic landscape. In this work, we apply a statistical approach, called topic modeling, on text documents of job loss notices of 26 US states to identify the specific states and industrial sectors affected economically by this ongoing public health crisis. Our analysis reveals that there is a considerable incongruity in job loss patterns between the pre- and during-COVID timelines in several states and the recreational and philanthropic sectors register high job losses. It further shows that the interplay among several possible socioeconomic factors would lead to job losses in many sectors, while also creating new job opportunities in other sectors such as public service, pharmaceuticals and media, making the job loss trends a key indicator of the world economy. Finally, we compare the low income job loss rates against overall job losses due to COVID-19 in the US counties, and discuss the implications of press reports on reopening businesses and the unemployed workforce being absorbed by other sectors.","Roy, Satyaki; Dutta, Ronojoy; Ghosh, Preetam",Social sciences & humanities open,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590291120300875; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590291120300875?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173505/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssaho.2020.100098,136

690501,Residual Lung Function Impairment Is Associated with Hyperventilation in Patients Recovered from Hospitalised COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study,2021-03-03,"BACKGROUND: BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (3 μg or 6 μg) formulated with a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule (IMDG) adsorbed to alum (Algel). We previously reported findings from a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial on the safety and immunogenicity of three different formulations of BBV152 (3 μg with Algel-IMDG, 6 μg with Algel-IMDG, or 6 μg with Algel) and one Algel-only control (no antigen), with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 14. The 3 μg and 6 μg with Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for this phase 2 study. Herein, we report interim findings of the phase 2 trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152, with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 28. METHODS: We did a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152 in healthy adults and adolescents (aged 12–65 years) at nine hospitals in India. Participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 3 μg with Algel-IMDG or 6 μg with Algel-IMDG. Block randomisation was done by use of an interactive web response system. Participants, investigators, study coordinators, study-related personnel, and the sponsor were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccine were administered on day 0 and day 28. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 wild-type neutralising antibody titres and seroconversion rates (defined as a post-vaccination titre that was at least four-fold higher than the baseline titre) at 4 weeks after the second dose (day 56), measured by use of the plaque-reduction neutralisation test (PRNT(50)) and the microneutralisation test (MNT(50)). The primary outcome was assessed in all participants who had received both doses of the vaccine. Cell-mediated responses were a secondary outcome and were assessed by T-helper-1 (Th1)/Th2 profiling at 2 weeks after the second dose (day 42). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the vaccine. In addition, we report immunogenicity results from a follow-up blood draw collected from phase 1 trial participants at 3 months after they received the second dose (day 104). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04471519. FINDINGS: Between Sept 5 and 12, 2020, 921 participants were screened, of whom 380 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the 3 μg with Algel-IMDG group (n=190) or 6 μg with Algel-IMDG group (n=190). Geometric mean titres (GMTs; PRNT(50)) at day 56 were significantly higher in the 6 μg with Algel-IMDG group (197·0 [95% CI 155·6–249·4]) than the 3 μg with Algel-IMDG group (100·9 [74·1–137·4]; p=0·0041). Seroconversion based on PRNT(50) at day 56 was reported in 171 (92·9% [95% CI 88·2–96·2] of 184 participants in the 3 μg with Algel-IMDG group and 174 (98·3% [95·1–99·6]) of 177 participants in the 6 μg with Algel-IMDG group. GMTs (MNT(50)) at day 56 were 92·5 (95% CI 77·7–110·2) in the 3 μg with Algel-IMDG group and 160·1 (135·8–188·8) in the 6 μg with Algel-IMDG group. Seroconversion based on MNT(50) at day 56 was reported in 162 (88·0% [95% CI 82·4–92·3]) of 184 participants in the 3 μg with Algel-IMDG group and 171 (96·6% [92·8–98·8]) of 177 participants in the 6 μg with Algel-IMDG group. The 3 μg with Algel-IMDG and 6 μg with Algel-IMDG formulations elicited T-cell responses that were biased to a Th1 phenotype at day 42. No significant difference in the proportion of participants who had a solicited local or systemic adverse reaction in the 3 μg with Algel-IMDG group (38 [20·0%; 95% CI 14·7–26·5] of 190) and the 6 μg with Algel-IMDG group (40 [21·1%; 15·5–27·5] of 190) was observed on days 0–7 and days 28–35; no serious adverse events were reported in the study. From the phase 1 trial, 3-month post-second-dose GMTs (MNT(50)) were 39·9 (95% CI 32·0–49·9) in the 3μg with Algel-IMDG group, 69·5 (53·7–89·9) in the 6 μg with Algel-IMDG group, 53·3 (40·1–71·0) in the 6 μg with Algel group, and 20·7 (14·5–29·5) in the Algel alone group. INTERPRETATION: In the phase 1 trial, BBV152 induced high neutralising antibody responses that remained elevated in all participants at 3 months after the second vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 showed better reactogenicity and safety outcomes, and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses compared with the phase 1 trial. The 6 μg with Algel-IMDG formulation has been selected for the phase 3 efficacy trial. FUNDING: Bharat Biotech International.
