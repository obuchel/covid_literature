1280,"Genetic Analysis of West Nile Virus Isolates from an Outbreak in Idaho, United States, 2006–2007",2013-09-23,"West Nile virus (WNV) appeared in the U.S. in 1999 and has since become endemic, with yearly summer epidemics causing tens of thousands of cases of serious disease over the past 14 years. Analysis of WNV strains isolated during the 2006–2007 epidemic seasons demonstrates that a new genetic variant had emerged coincidentally with an intense outbreak in Idaho during 2006. The isolates belonging to the new variant carry a 13 nt deletion, termed ID-Δ13, located at the variable region of the 3′UTR, and are genetically related. The analysis of deletions and insertions in the 3′UTR of two major lineages of WNV revealed the presence of conserved repeats and two indel motifs in the variable region of the 3′UTR. One human and two bird isolates from the Idaho 2006–2007 outbreaks were sequenced using Illumina technology and within-host variability was analyzed. Continued monitoring of new genetic variants is important for public health as WNV continues to evolve.","Grinev, Andriyan; Chancey, Caren; Añez, Germán; Ball, Christopher; Winkelman, Valerie; Williamson, Phillip; Foster, Gregory A.; Stramer, Susan L.; Rios, Maria",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3799518/,282
1338,Design and Experimental Approach to the Construction of a Human Signal-Molecule-Profiling Database,2013-12-09,"The human signal-molecule-profiling database (HSMPD) is designed as a prospective medical database for translational bioinformatics (TBI). To explore the feasibility of low-cost database construction, we studied the roadmap of HSMPD. A HSMPD-oriented tool, called “signal-molecule-profiling (SMP) chip” was developed for data acquisition, which can be employed in the routine blood tests in hospitals; the results will be stored in the HSMPD system automatically. HSMPD system can provide data services for the TBI community, which generates a stable income to support the data acquisition. The small-scale experimental test was performed in the hospital to verify SMP chips and the demo HSMPD software. One hundred and eighty nine complete SMP records were collected, and the demo HSMPD system was also evaluated in the survey study on patients and doctors. The function of SMP chip was verified, whereas the demo HSMPD software needed to be improved. The survey study showed that patients would only accept free tests of SMP chips when they originally needed blood examinations. The study indicated that the construction of HSMPD relies on the self-motivated cooperation of the TBI community and the traditional healthcare system. The proposed roadmap potentially provides an executable solution to build the HSMPD without high costs.","Zhao, Xinyan; Dong, Tao",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3881147/,282
1466,European Monitoring Systems and Data for Assessing Environmental and Climate Impacts on Human Infectious Diseases,2014-04-09,"Surveillance is critical to understanding the epidemiology and control of infectious diseases. The growing concern over climate and other drivers that may increase infectious disease threats to future generations has stimulated a review of the surveillance systems and environmental data sources that might be used to assess future health impacts from climate change in Europe. We present an overview of organizations, agencies and institutions that are responsible for infectious disease surveillance in Europe. We describe the surveillance systems, tracking tools, communication channels, information exchange and outputs in light of environmental and climatic drivers of infectious diseases. We discuss environmental and climatic data sets that lend themselves to epidemiological analysis. Many of the environmental data sets have a relatively uniform quality across EU Member States because they are based on satellite measurements or EU funded FP6 or FP7 projects with full EU coverage. Case-reporting systems for surveillance of infectious diseases should include clear and consistent case definitions and reporting formats that are geo-located at an appropriate resolution. This will allow linkage to environmental, social and climatic sources that will enable risk assessments, future threat evaluations, outbreak management and interventions to reduce disease burden.","Nichols, Gordon L.; Andersson, Yvonne; Lindgren, Elisabet; Devaux, Isabelle; Semenza, Jan C.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4025019/,282
2328,Sounding the Alarm: Health in the Anthropocene,2016-06-30,"There is growing scientific and public recognition that human actions, directly and indirectly, have profoundly changed the Earth system, in a still accelerating process, increasingly called the “Anthropocene”. Planetary transformation, including of the atmosphere, climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, has enormous implications for human health, many of which are deeply disturbing, especially in low-income settings. A few health consequences of the Anthropocene have been partially recognized, including within environmental epidemiology, but their long-term consequences remain poorly understood and greatly under-rated. For example Syria could be a “sentinel” population, giving a glimpse to a much wider dystopian future. Health-Earth is a research network, co-founded in 2014, which seeks, with other groups, to catalyse a powerful curative response by the wider health community. This paper builds on a symposium presented by Health-Earth members at the 2015 conference of the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology. It reviews and synthesizes parts of the large literature relevant to the interaction between the changing Earth system and human health. It concludes that this topic should be prominent within future environmental epidemiology and public health. Created by our species, these challenges may be soluble, but solutions require far more understanding and resources than are currently being made available.","Butler, Colin D.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4962206/,282
2994,Airborne or Fomite Transmission for Norovirus? A Case Study Revisited,2017-12-14,"Norovirus infection, a highly prevalent condition associated with a high rate of morbidity, comprises a significant health issue. Although norovirus transmission mainly occurs via the fecal-oral and vomit-oral routes, airborne transmission has been proposed in recent decades. This paper re-examines a previously described norovirus outbreak in a hotel restaurant wherein airborne transmission was originally inferred. Specifically, the original evidence that suggested airborne transmission was re-analyzed by exploring an alternative hypothesis: could this outbreak instead have occurred via fomite transmission? This re-analysis was based on whether fomite transmission could have yielded similar attack rate distribution patterns. Seven representative serving pathways used by waiters were considered, and the infection risk distributions of the alternative fomite transmission routes were predicted using a multi-agent model. These distributions were compared to the reported attack rate distribution in the original study using a least square methods approach. The results show that with some reasonable assumptions of human behavior patterns and parameter values, the attack rate distribution corresponded well with that of the infection risk via the fomite route. This finding offers an alternative interpretation of the transmission routes that underlay this particular norovirus outbreak and an important consideration in the development of infection control guidelines and the investigation of similar norovirus outbreaks in future.","Xiao, Shenglan; Tang, Julian W.; Li, Yuguo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5750989/,282
3843,"Molecular Detection and Epidemiological Features of Selected Bacterial, Viral, and Parasitic Enteropathogens in Stool Specimens from Children with Acute Diarrhea in Thi-Qar Governorate, Iraq",2019-05-06,"Knowledge of etiology causes of diarrheal illness is essential for development and implementation of public health measures to prevent and control this disease syndrome. There are few published studies examining diarrhea in children aged <5 years in Iraq. This study aims to investigate the occurrences and epidemiology of selected bacterial (Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp.), viral (adenovirus, norovirus GI and GII, and astrovirus), and parasitic (Entamoeba spp. and Giardia spp.) agents in stool samples from 155 child diarrheal cases enrolled between March and August 2017, in a hospital-based cross-sectional study in Thi-Qar, southeastern Iraq. Using molecular techniques and sequence-based characterization, adenovirus was the most frequently detected enteropathogen (53/155 (34.2%)), followed by Salmonella spp. (23/155 (14.8%)), Entamoeba spp. (21/155 (13.5%)), and Campylobacter spp. (17/155 (10.9%)). Mixed infection with Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. was evident, and the same was revealed between various enteric viruses, particularly adenovirus and norovirus. The most frequent co-infection pattern was between adenovirus and Campylobacter spp., in seven cases (7/155 (4.5%)). Whole-genome sequencing-derived typing data for Salmonella isolates (n = 23) revealed that sequence type 49 was the most prevalent in this sample set (15/23 (65.2%)). To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first report on detection and identification of floR, bla(CARB-2), and mphA antimicrobial resistance genes in Salmonella isolated from children in the Middle East region. Logistic regression analysis pointed to few enteropathogen-specific correlations between child age, household water source, and breastfeeding patterns in relation to the outcome of detection of individual enteropathogens. This study presents the first published molecular investigation of multiple enteropathogens among children <5 years of age in Iraq. Our data provide supporting evidence for planning of childhood diarrhea management programs. It is important to build on this study and develop future longitudinal case-control research in order to elaborate the epidemiology of enteropathogens in childhood diarrhea in Iraq.","Harb, Ali; Abraham, Sam; Rusdi, Bertha; Laird, Tanya; O’Dea, Mark; Habib, Ihab",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6539995/,282
4647,Infection Spread and High-Resolution Detection of Close Contact Behaviors,2020-02-24,"BACKGROUND: Children with Down syndrome (DS) show a high susceptibility to recurrent infections (RI), caused by immune defects and abnormalities of the airways. Our goal was to investigate the effects of Pidotimod on RI prevention in children with DS, comparing immune and clinical parameters before (T0) and after (T1) the treatment with Pidotimod. METHODS: The study was conducted at the Down syndrome outpatient Center of Bambino Gesù Children’s Hospital, in Rome. We reviewed the medical records of all children with a positive history for RI and who received oral prophylaxis of Pidotimod from September 2016 to February 2017. RESULTS: Thirty-three children met the inclusion criteria (males: 51.5%; average age: 6 years ±SD: 3). We found a significant decrease in the number of children with upper respiratory infections (82% at T0 vs 24% at T1; p = 0,0001) and with lower respiratory infections (36% at T0 vs 9% at T1; p = 0.003) after treatment with Pidotimod. We also demonstrated a significant decrease in the number of children hospitalized for respiratory infections (18% at T0 vs 3% at T1; p = 0.03). We measured T and B cells in the peripheral blood and B cell function in vitro at T0 and T1. We found that the response to CpG improved at T1. A significant increase of B cell frequency (p = 0.0009), B cell proliferation (p = 0.0278) and IgM secretion (p = 0.0478) were observed in children with DS after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provided evidence that Pidotimod may be able to prevent RI in children with Down syndrome.","Valentini, Diletta; Di Camillo, Chiara; Mirante, Nadia; Marcellini, Valentina; Carsetti, Rita; Villani, Alberto",Ital J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7068926/,282
4648,"Awareness, Knowledge, Attitude and Preventive Practice of Leptospirosis Among Healthy Malaysian and Non-Malaysian Wet Market Workers in Selected Urban Areas in Selangor, Malaysia",2020-02-19,"BACKGROUND: The International Standards for a Safe Practice of Anesthesia (ISSPA) were developed on behalf of the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists and the World Health Organization. It has been recommend as an assessment tool that allows anesthetic providers in developing countries to assess their compliance and needs. This study was performed to describe the anesthesia service in one main public hospital during an 8-month medical mission in Cambodia and evaluate its anesthetic safety issues according to the ISSPA. METHODS: We conduct a retrospective study involving 1953 patients at the Preah Ket Mealea hospital. Patient demographics, anesthetic techniques, and complications were reviewed according to the registers of the anesthetic services and questionnaires. The inadequacies in personnel, facilities, equipment, medications, and conduct of anesthesia drugs were recorded using a checklist based on the ISSPA. RESULTS: A total of 1792 patients received general and regional anesthesia in the operating room, while 161 patients receiving sedation for gastroscopy. The patients’ mean age was 45.0 ± 16.6 years (range, 17–87 years). The three most common surgical procedures were abdominal (52.0%; confidence interval [CI], 49.3–54.7), orthopedic (27.6%; CI, 25.2–29.9), and urological surgery (14.7%; CI, 12.8–16.6). General anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, and brachial plexus block were performed in 54.3% (CI, 51.7–56.8), 28.2% (CI, 25.9–30.5), and 9.4% (CI, 7.9–10.9) of patients, respectively. One death occurred. Twenty-six items related to professional aspects, monitoring, and conduct of anesthesia did not meet the ISSPA-recommended standards. A lack of commonly used drugs and monitoring equipment was noted, posing major threats to the safety of anesthesia practice, especially in emergency situations. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the scarce literature on anesthesia practice in low- and middle-income countries such as Cambodia. Future medical assistance should help to strengthen these countries’ inadequacies, allowing for the adoption of international standards for the safe practice of anesthesia.","Tao, Kun-ming; Sokha, Sann; Yuan, Hong-bin",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7068932/,282
10521,Investigating the Strategies Adopted by Emergency Nurses to Address Uncertainty and Change in the Event of Emerging Infectious Diseases: A Grounded Theory Study,2020-04-06,"The host cell protease TMPRSS2 cleaves the influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin (HA). Several reports have described resistance of Tmprss2(−/−) knock-out (KO) mice to IAV infection but IAV of the H2 subtype have not been examined yet. Here, we demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is able to cleave H2-HA in cell culture and that Tmprss2(−/−) mice are resistant to infection with a re-assorted PR8_HA(H2) virus. Infection of KO mice did not cause major body weight loss or death. Furthermore, no significant increase in lung weights and no virus replication were observed in Tmprss2(−/−) mice. Finally, only minor tissue damage and infiltration of immune cells were detected and no virus-positive cells were found in histological sections of Tmprss2(−/−) mice. In summary, our studies indicate that TMPRSS2 is required for H2 IAV spread and pathogenesis in mice. These findings extend previous results pointing towards a central role of TMPRSS2 in IAV infection and validate host proteases as a potential target for antiviral therapy.","Lambertz, Ruth Lydia Olga; Gerhauser, Ingo; Nehlmeier, Inga; Gärtner, Sabine; Winkler, Michael; Leist, Sarah Rebecca; Kollmus, Heike; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Schughart, Klaus",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7178614/,282
10869,"The Impact of Non-optimum Ambient Temperature on Years of Life Lost: A Multi-county Observational Study in Hunan, China",2020-04-14,"Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is a life-saving technology that provides transient respiratory and circulatory support for patients with profound cardiogenic shock or refractory cardiac arrest. Among its potential complications, VA-ECMO may adversely affect lung function through various pathophysiological mechanisms. The interaction of blood components with the biomaterials of the extracorporeal membrane elicits a systemic inflammatory response which may increase pulmonary vascular permeability and promote the sequestration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils within the lung parenchyma. Also, VA-ECMO increases the afterload of the left ventricle (LV) through reverse flow within the thoracic aorta, resulting in increased LV filling pressure and pulmonary congestion. Furthermore, VA-ECMO may result in long-standing pulmonary hypoxia, due to partial shunting of the pulmonary circulation and to reduced pulsatile blood flow within the bronchial circulation. Ultimately, these different abnormalities may result in a state of persisting lung inflammation and fibrotic changes with concomitant functional impairment, which may compromise weaning from VA-ECMO and could possibly result in long-term lung dysfunction. This review presents the mechanisms of lung damage and dysfunction under VA-ECMO and discusses potential strategies to prevent and treat such alterations.","Roumy, Aurélien; Liaudet, Lucas; Rusca, Marco; Marcucci, Carlo; Kirsch, Matthias",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7216520/,282

11843,The Association between Utilization of Media Information and Current Health Anxiety Among the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster Evacuees,2020-06-01,"Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that originates in the pigment-producing cells of the body known as melanocytes. Most genetic aberrations in melanoma result in hyperactivation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. We and others have shown that a specific protein synthesis pathway known as the MNK1/2-eIF4E axis is often dysregulated in cancer. The MNK1/2-eIF4E axis is a point of convergence for these signaling pathways that are commonly constitutively activated in melanoma. In this review we consider the functional implications of aberrant mRNA translation in melanoma and other malignancies. Moreover, we discuss the consequences of inhibiting the MNK1/2-eIF4E axis on the tumor and tumor-associated cells, and we provide important avenues for the utilization of this treatment modality in combination with other targeted and immune-based therapies. The past decade has seen the increased development of selective inhibitors to block the action of the MNK1/2-eIF4E pathway, which are predicted to be an effective therapy regardless of the melanoma subtype (e.g., cutaneous, acral, and mucosal).","Prabhu, Sathyen A.; Moussa, Omar; Miller, Wilson H.; del Rincón, Sonia V.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7312468/,282

However, the comorbidity patterns of nurses’ health problems and the association between health problems and turnover intention have rarely been studied. This study aimed to identify and cluster shift work nurses’ health problems and to reveal the associations between health problems and turnover intention. In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed data from 500 nurses who worked at two tertiary hospitals in Seoul, South Korea. Data, including turnover intention and nine types of health issues, were collected between March 2018 and April 2019. Hierarchical clustering and multiple ordinal logistic regressions were used for the data analysis. Among the participants, 22.2% expressed turnover intention and the mean number of health problems was 4.5 (range 0–9). Using multiple ordinal logistic regressions analysis, it was shown that sleep disturbance, depression, fatigue, a gastrointestinal disorder, and leg or foot discomfort as a single health problem significantly increased turnover intention. After clustering the health problems, four clusters were identified and only the neuropsychological cluster—sleep disturbance, fatigue, and depression—significantly increased turnover intention. We propose that health problems within the neuropsychological cluster must receive close attention and be addressed simultaneously to decrease nurse’s turnover intentions.","Ki, Jison; Ryu, Jaegeum; Baek, Jihyun; Huh, Iksoo; Choi-Kwon, Smi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7345885/,282
12049,Exploring the Roles of Green Food Consumption and Social Trust in the Relationship between Perceived Consumer Effectiveness and Psychological Wellbeing,2020-06-29,"Maintaining intestinal health in livestock is critical during the weaning period. The precise mechanisms of intestinal dysfunction during this period are not fully understood, although these can be alleviated by phlorotannins, including eckol. This question was addressed by evaluating the changes in gene expression and intestinal function after eckol treatment during suckling-to-weaning transition. The biological roles of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in intestinal development were investigated by assessing intestinal wound healing and barrier functions, as well as the associated signaling pathways and oxidative stress levels. We identified 890 DEGs in the intestine, whose expression was altered by eckol treatment, including pancreatic and duodenal homeobox (PDX)1, which directly regulate heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HBEGF) expression in order to preserve intestinal barrier functions and promote wound healing through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and P38 signaling. Additionally, eckol alleviated H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress through PI3K/AKT, P38, and 5’-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, improved growth, and reduced oxidative stress and intestinal permeability in pigs during the weaning period. Eckol modulates intestinal barrier functions, wound healing, and oxidative stress through PDX/HBEGF, and improves growth during the suckling-to-weaning transition. These findings suggest that eckol can be used as a feed supplement in order to preserve the intestinal functions in pigs and other livestock during this process.","Lee, Sang In; Kim, In Ho",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7370175/,282
12630,Prioritizing Training Needs of School Health Staff: The Example of Vietnam,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND: Heterozygosity at HLA class I loci is generally considered beneficial for host defense. We report here an element of HLA class I homozygosity that may or may not help preserve its existence in populations but which could indicate a new avenue for antiviral research. METHODS: Lymphocytes from serologically HLA-homozygous or -heterozygous donors were examined for synthesis of influenza virus proteins and RNA after exposure to virus as peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The virus-exposed lymphocytes were also examined for internalization of the virus after exposure, and for susceptibility to virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in comparison with virus-exposed monocytes/macrophages and unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Results were compared using two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. RESULTS: Serologically-defined HLA-A2-homozygous lymphocytes, in contrast to heterozygous lymphocytes, did not synthesize detectable influenza virus RNA or protein after exposure to the virus. HLA-A2-homozygous lymphocytes, including both homozygous and heterozygous donors by genetic sequence subtyping, did internalize infectious virus but were not susceptible to lysis by autologous virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (“fratricide”). Similar intrinsic resistance to influenza virus infection was observed with HLA-A1- and HLA-A11-homozygous lymphocytes and with HLA-B-homozygous lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of individuals within a population that is characterized by common expression of HLA class I alleles may possess lymphocytes that are not susceptible to influenza virus infection and thus to mutual virus-specific lysis. Further study may identify new approaches to limit influenza virus infection.","Ochoa, Eliana E.; Huda, Ruksana; Scheibel, Steven F.; Nichols, Joan E.; Mock, David J.; El-Daher, Nayef; Domurat, Frank M.; Roberts, Norbert J.",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7444183/,282

Does Mobility Play a Role?,2020-09-29,"For intelligent manufacturing systems, there are many deviations in operational characteristics, and the coupling effect of harmful operational characteristics leads to the variations in quality of the work-in-process (WIP) and the degradation of the reliability of the finished product, which is reflected as a loss of product manufacturing reliability. However, few studies on the modeling of product manufacturing reliability and mechanism analysis consider the operating mechanism and the coupling of characteristics. Thus, a novel modeling approach based on quality variations centered on the coupling of operational characteristics is proposed to analyze the formation mechanism of product manufacturing reliability. First, the PQR chain containing the co-effects among the manufacturing system performance (P), the manufacturing process quality (Q), and the product manufacturing reliability (R) is elaborated. The connotation of product manufacturing reliability is defined, multilayered operational characteristics are determined, and operational data are collected by smart sensors. Second, on the basis of the coupling effect in the PQR chain, a multilayered product quality variation model is proposed by mining operational characteristic data obtained from sensors. Third, an integrated product manufacturing reliability model is presented on the basis of the variation propagation mechanism of the multilayered product quality variation model. Finally, a camshaft manufacturing reliability analysis is conducted to verify the validity of the proposed method. The method proposed in this paper proved to be effective for evaluating and predicting the product reliability in the smart manufacturing process.","Zhang, Anqi; He, Yihai; Han, Xiao; Li, Yao; Yang, Xiuzhen; Zhang, Zixuan",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7582378/,282

We investigated the anti-HSV activity of various natural and synthetic compounds for future clinical application. Methods: Mock- and HSV-infected Vero cells were treated for three days with various concentrations of samples. For short exposure, 100-fold concentrated virus were preincubated for 3 min with samples, diluted to normal multiplicity of infection (MOI), before the addition to the cells. Anti-HSV activity was evaluated by the chemotherapy index. Results: Alkaline extracts of the leaves of Sasa sp. (SE) and pine cone (PCE) showed higher anti-HSV activity than 20 Japanese traditional herb medicines (Kampo formulas), four popular polyphenols, and 119 chromone-related compounds. Exposure of HSV to SE or PCE for 3 min almost completely eliminated the infectivity of HSV, whereas much longer exposure time was required for Kakkonto, the most active Kampo formulae. Anti-HSV activity of PCE and Kakkonto could be detected only when they were dissolved by alkaline solution (pH 8.0), but not by neutral buffer (pH 7.4). Anti-HSV activity of SE and povidone iodine was stable if they were diluted with neutral buffer.

Pirfenidone and nintedanib slow down but do not stop the progression of IPF. Thus, new compounds with high antifibrotic activity and simultaneously regenerative activity are an unmet clinical need. Recently, we showed that Treamid can help restoring the pancreas and testicular tissue in mice with metabolic disorders. We hypothesized that Treamid may be effective in antifibrotic therapy and regeneration of damaged lung tissue in pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, experiments were performed on male C57BL/6 mice with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. We applied histological and immunohistochemical methods, ELISA, and assessed the expression of markers of endothelial and epithelial cells in primary cultures of CD31(+) and CD326(+) lung cells. Finally, we evaluated esterase activity and apoptosis of lung cells in vitro. Our data indicate that Treamid exhibits antifibrotic activity in mice with pulmonary fibrosis and has a positive effect on capillaries of the lungs. Treamid also increases the number of endothelial progenitor cells in the lungs of animals with pulmonary fibrosis. Lastly, Treamid increases esterase activity and decreases apoptosis of CD31(+) lung cells in vitro. Based on these findings, we suggest that Treamid may represent a promising compound for the development of new antifibrotic agents, which are capable of stimulating regeneration of lung endothelium in IPF patients.","Skurikhin, Evgenii; Nebolsin, Vladimir; Widera, Darius; Ermakova, Natalia; Pershina, Olga; Pakhomova, Angelina; Krupin, Vyacheslav; Pan, Edgar; Zhukova, Mariia; Novikov, Fedor; Sandrikina, Lubov; Morozov, Sergey; Kubatiev, Aslan; Dygai, Alexander",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7664690/,282

However, it is inevitable that more high-profile biological drug targets will be identified for which high-quality, highly homogenous crystal systems cannot be found. With increasing heterogeneity in crystal systems, the application of current multi-data-set methods becomes ever less sensitive to bound ligands. In order to ease the bottleneck of finding a well behaved crystal system, pre-clustering of data sets can be carried out using cluster4x after data collection to separate data sets into smaller partitions in order to restore the sensitivity of multi-data-set methods. Here, the software cluster4x is introduced for this purpose and validated against published data sets using PanDDA, showing an improved total signal from existing ligands and identifying new hits in both highly heterogenous and less heterogenous multi-data sets. cluster4x provides the researcher with an interactive graphical user interface with which to explore multi-data set experiments.","Ginn, Helen M.",Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7604910/,282
14098,The Influence of Maturity Status on Anthropometric Profile and Body Composition of Youth Goalkeepers,2020-11-08,"BACKGROUND: Nowadays, numerous health-related mobile apps implement gamification in an attempt to draw on the motivational potential of video games and thereby increase user engagement or foster certain health behaviors. However, research on effective gamification is still in its infancy and researchers increasingly recognize methodological shortcomings of existing studies. What we actually know about the phenomenon today stems from fragmented pieces of knowledge, and a variety of different perspectives. Existing research primarily draws on conceptual knowledge that is gained from research prototypes, and isolated from industry best practices. We still lack knowledge on how gamification has been successfully designed and implemented within the industry and whether certain gamification approaches have shown to be particularly suitable for certain health behaviors. OBJECTIVE: We address this lack of knowledge concerning best practices in the design and implementation of gamification for health-related mobile apps by identifying archetypes of gamification approaches that have emerged in pertinent health-related mobile apps and analyzing to what extent those gamification approaches are influenced by the underlying desired health-related outcomes. METHODS: A 3-step research approach is employed. As a first step, a database of 143 pertinent gamified health-related mobile apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store is set up. Second, the gamification approach of each app within the database is classified based on an established taxonomy for gamification in health-related apps. Finally, a 2-step cluster analysis is conducted in order to identify archetypes of the most dominant gamification approaches in pertinent gamified health-related mobile apps. RESULTS: Eight archetypes of gamification emerged from the analysis of health-related mobile apps: (1) competition and collaboration, (2) pursuing self-set goals without rewards, (3) episodical compliance tracking, (4) inherent gamification for external goals, (5) internal rewards for self-set goals, (6) continuous assistance through positive reinforcement, (7) positive and negative reinforcement without rewards, and (8) progressive gamification for health professionals. The results indicate a close relationship between the identified archetypes and the actual health behavior that is being targeted. CONCLUSIONS: By unveiling salient best practices and discussing their relationship to targeted health behaviors, this study contributes to a more profound understanding of gamification in mobile health. The results can serve as a foundation for future research that advances the knowledge on how gamification may positively influence health behavior change and guide practitioners in the design and development of highly motivating and effective health-related mobile health apps.","Schmidt-Kraepelin, Manuel; Toussaint, Philipp A; Thiebes, Scott; Hamari, Juho; Sunyaev, Ali",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7605978/,282

A Case Study on Network Relation of Environmental Regulatory Capture in China,2020-12-08,"The search for sustainability in the Supply Chain (SC) is one of the tasks that most concerns business leaders in all manufacturing sectors because of the importance that the Supply Chain has as a transversal tool and due to the leading role that it has been playing lately. Of all the manufacturing sectors, this study focuses on the aerospace, shipbuilding, and automotive sectors identified as transport. The present study carries out a descriptive review of existing publications in these three sectors in relation to the sustainability of the Supply Chain in its 4.0 adaptation as an update in matters that are in constant evolution. Among the results obtained, Lean practices are common to the three sectors, as well as different technologies focused on sustainability. Furthermore, the results show that the automotive sector is the one that makes the greatest contribution in this sense through collaborative programs that can be very useful to the other two sectors, thus benefiting from the consequent applicable advantages. Meanwhile, the Aerospace and Shipbuilding sectors do not seem to be working on promoting a sustainable culture in the management of the Supply Chain or on including training programs for their personnel in matters related to Industry 4.0.","Ramirez-Peña, Magdalena; Mayuet, Pedro F.; Vazquez-Martinez, Juan Manuel; Batista, Moises",Materials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7762985/,282
14526,Assessment of the Quality of Mobile Applications (Apps) for Management of Low Back Pain Using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS),2020-12-09,"Patients with severe mental illness have increased mortality, often linked to cardio-metabolic disease. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) incidence is higher in patients with schizophrenia and is exacerbated with antipsychotic treatment. NAFLD is associated with obesity and insulin resistance, both of which are induced by several antipsychotic medications. NAFLD is considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death for patients with severe mental illness. Although the clinical literature clearly defines increased risk of NAFLD with antipsychotic therapy, the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Given the complexity of the disorder as well as the complex pharmacology associated with atypical antipsychotic (AA) medications, we chose to use a proteomic approach in healthy mice treated with a low dose of risperidone (RIS) or olanzapine (OLAN) for 28 days to determine effects on development of NAFLD and to identify pathways impacted by AA medications, while removing confounding intrinsic effects of mental illness. Both AA drugs caused development of steatosis in comparison with vehicle controls (p < 0.01) and affected multiple pathways relating to energy metabolism, NAFLD, and immune function. AA-associated alteration in autonomic function appears to be a unifying theme in the regulation of hepatic pathology.","Rostama, Bahman; Beauchemin, Megan; Bouchard, Celeste; Bernier, Elizabeth; Vary, Calvin P.

14543,Trends in Social Acceptance of Renewable Energy Across Europe—A Literature Review,2020-12-08,"The environment has direct and indirect effects on mental health. Previous studies acknowledge that the poor design of communities and social environments leads to increased psychological distress, but methodological issues make it difficult to draw clear conclusions. Recent public health, leisure and recreation studies have tried to determine the relationship between recreation opportunities and mental health. However, previous studies have heavily focused on individual contexts rather than national or regional levels; this is a major limitation. It is difficult to reflect the characteristics of community environments effectively with such limited studies, because social environments and infrastructure should be analyzed using a spatial perspective that goes beyond an individual’s behavioral patterns. Other limitations include lack of socioeconomic context and appropriate data to represent the characteristics of a local community and its environment. To date, very few studies have tested the spatial relationships between mental health and recreation opportunities on a national level, while controlling for a variety of competing explanations (e.g., the social determinants of mental health). To address these gaps, this study used multi-level spatial data combined with various sources to: (1) identify variables that contribute to spatial disparities of mental health; (2) examine how selected variables influence spatial mental health disparities using a generalized linear model (GLM); (3) specify the spatial variation of the relationships between recreation opportunities and mental health in the continental U.S. using geographically weighted regression (GWR). The findings suggest that multiple factors associated with poor mental health days, particularly walkable access to local parks, showed the strongest explanatory power in both the GLM and GWR models. In addition, negative relationships were found with educational attainment, racial/ethnic dynamics, and lower levels of urbanization, while positive relationships were found with poverty rate and unemployment in the GLM. Finally, the GWR model detected differences in the strength and direction of associations for 3109 counties. These results may address the gaps in previous studies that focused on individual-level scales and did not include a spatial context.","Lee, Kyung Hee",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7764908/,282

It is associated with many morbid maternal and fetal outcomes. Mood dysregulations (MDs, e.g., depression, distress, and anxiety) are common among women with GDM, and they exacerbate its prognosis and hinder its treatment. Hence, in addition to early detection and proper management of GDM, treating the associated MDs is crucial. Maternal hyperglycemia and MDs result from a complex network of genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors. This review briefly explores mechanisms that underlie GDM and prenatal MDs. It also describes the effect of exercise, dietary modification, and intermittent fasting (IF) on metabolic and affective dysfunctions exemplified by a case report. In this patient, interventions such as IF considerably reduced maternal body weight, plasma glucose, and psychological distress without any adverse effects. Thus, IF is one measure that can control GDM and maternal MDs; however, more investigations are warranted.","Ali, Amira Mohammed; Kunugi, Hiroshi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7765295/,282

The influx of the macrophages and the regulation of macrophage phenotype, inflammatory or anti-inflammatory, are controlled by the small GTPase RhoA and its downstream effectors. Therefore, macrophages and the components of the RhoA pathway are attractive targets for anti-atherosclerotic therapies, which would inhibit macrophage influx and inflammatory phenotype, maintain an anti-inflammatory environment, and promote tissue remodeling and repair. Here, we discuss the recent findings on the role of macrophages and RhoA pathway in the atherosclerotic plaque formation and resolution and the novel therapeutic approaches.","Kloc, Malgorzata; Uosef, Ahmed; Kubiak, Jacek Z.; Ghobrial, Rafik Mark",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7796231/,282

Taking PM(2.5) emission data as the intermediate link to explore the correlation between corresponding sectors behind various PM(2.5) emission sources and urban expansion in the process of urbanization, and formulating effective policies, have become major issues. In this paper, based on long temporal coverage and high-quality nighttime light data seen from the top of the atmosphere and recently compiled PM(2.5) emissions data from different sources (transportation, residential and commercial, industry, energy production, deforestation and wildfire, and agriculture), we built an advanced Bayesian spatio-temporal autoregressive model and a local regression model to quantitatively analyze the correlation between PM(2.5) emissions from different sources and urban expansion in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Our results suggest that the overall urban expansion in the study area maintained gradual growth from 1995 to 2014, with the fastest growth rate during 2005 to 2010; the urban expansion maintained a significant positive correlation with PM(2.5) emissions from transportation, energy production, and industry; different anti-haze policies should be designated according to respective local conditions in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei provinces; and during the period of rapid urban expansion (2005–2010), the spatial correlations between PM(2.5) emissions from different sources and urban expansion also changed, with the biggest change coming from the PM(2.5) emissions from the transport sector.","Zhao, Shen; Xu, Yong",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7828208/,282

Notably, this niclosamide ASD formulation increased the apparent drug solubility about 60-fold relative to the crystalline material due to the generation of nanoparticles. Niclosamide is a weakly acidic drug, Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) class II, and a poor glass former with low bioavailability in vivo. Hot-melt extrusion is a high-throughput manufacturing method commonly used in the development of ASDs for increasing the apparent solubility and bioavailability of poorly water-soluble compounds. We utilized the polymer poly(1-vinylpyrrolidone-co-vinyl acetate) (PVP–VA) to manufacture niclosamide ASDs by extrusion. Samples were analyzed based on their microscopic and macroscopic behavior and their intermolecular interactions, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The niclosamide ASD generated nanoparticles with a mean particle size of about 100 nm in FaSSIF media. In a side-by-side diffusion test, these nanoparticles produced a four-fold increase in niclosamide diffusion. We successfully manufactured amorphous extrudates of the poor glass former niclosamide that showed remarkable in vitro dissolution and diffusion performance. These in vitro tests were translated to a rat model that also showed an increase in oral bioavailability.","Jara, Miguel O.; Warnken, Zachary N.; Williams, Robert O.",Pharmaceutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7828663/,282

We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Web of Science, Medline and PubMed were searched for studies published until August 2020. The review included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated and compared the effect of exercise versus usual care on inflammatory parameters in acutely hospitalized older adults. Two reviewers independently assessed the studies. The quality of all the included studies was assessed using the DerSimonian–Laird random-effects inverse-variance model. Five studies (275 participants) met the inclusion criteria. The exercise interventions included resistance or multicomponent intervention programs. The results indicate that, compared with usual care, exercise interventions have a positive impact on overall inflammatory parameters, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) (Hedge’s g = −0.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.33 to −0.04, p = 0.011, I(2) = 0%). However, analyses of individual inflammatory parameters revealed a non-significant trend for reductions in CRP (Hedge’s g = −0.20, 95% CI −0.47 to 0.07, p = 0.151, I(2) = 31.2%) and IGF-I (Hedge’s g = −0.34, 95% CI −0.79 to 0.11, p = 0.138, I(2) = 0%). On the basis of this review, we conclude that exercise during acute hospitalization offers a mild improvement in the inflammatory profile over usual care in older patients. Nevertheless, due to limited number of RCTs, our findings must be interpreted with caution and confirmed in future studies.","Ramírez-Vélez, Robinson; García-Hermoso, Antonio; Martínez-Velilla, Nicolás; Zambom-Ferraresi, Fabricio; L.

While healthcare systems around the world are faced with increasing costs, branded and generic drug companies are facing the challenge of creating market differentiators. Two of the problems associated with the partial or complete loss of response to chronic medications are a lack of adherence and compensatory responses to chronic drug administration, which leads to tolerance and loss of effectiveness. Approach and Results: First-generation artificial intelligence (AI) systems do not address these needs and suffer from a low adoption rate by patients and clinicians. Second-generation AI systems are focused on a single subject and on improving patients’ clinical outcomes. The digital pill, which combines a personalized second-generation AI system with a branded or generic drug, improves the patient response to drugs by increasing adherence and overcoming the loss of response to chronic medications. By improving the effectiveness of drugs, the digital pill reduces healthcare costs and increases end-user adoption. The digital pill also provides a market differentiator for branded and generic drug companies. Conclusions: Implementing the use of a digital pill is expected to reduce healthcare costs, providing advantages for all the players in the healthcare system including patients, clinicians, healthcare authorities, insurance companies, and drug manufacturers. The described business model for the digital pill is based on distributing the savings across all stakeholders, thereby enabling improved global health.","Ilan, Yaron",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7832873/,282
15627,"The Prevalence of Abdominal Adiposity among Primary Health Care Physicians in Bahia, Brazil: An Epidemiological Study",2021-01-22,"BACKGROUND: Age-adjusted US total pediatric cancer incidence rates (TPCIR) rose 49% 1975–2015 for unknown reasons. Prenatal cannabis exposure has been linked with several pediatric cancers which together comprise the majority of pediatric cancer types. We investigated whether cannabis use was related spatiotemporally and causally to TPCIR. METHODS: State-based age-adjusted TPCIR data was taken from the CDC Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results cancer database 2003–2017. Drug exposure was taken from the nationally-representative National Survey of Drug Use and Health, response rate 74.1%. Drugs included were: tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, opioid analgesics and cocaine. This was supplemented by cannabinoid concentration data from the Drug Enforcement Agency and ethnicity and median household income data from US Census. RESULTS: TPCIR rose while all drug use nationally fell, except for cannabis which rose. TPCIR in the highest cannabis use quintile was greater than in the lowest (β-estimate = 1.31 (95%C.I. 0.82, 1.80), P = 1.80 × 10(− 7)) and the time:highest two quintiles interaction was significant (β-estimate = 0.1395 (0.82, 1.80), P = 1.00 × 10(− 14)). In robust inverse probability weighted additive regression models cannabis was independently associated with TPCIR (β-estimate = 9.55 (3.95, 15.15), P = 0.0016). In interactive geospatiotemporal models including all drug, ethnic and income variables cannabis use was independently significant (β-estimate = 45.67 (18.77, 72.56), P = 0.0009). In geospatial models temporally lagged to 1,2,4 and 6 years interactive terms including cannabis were significant. Cannabis interactive terms at one and two degrees of spatial lagging were significant (from β-estimate = 3954.04 (1565.01, 6343.09), P = 0.0012). The interaction between the cannabinoids THC and cannabigerol was significant at zero, 2 and 6 years lag (from β-estimate = 46.22 (30.06, 62.38), P = 2.10 × 10(− 8)). Cannabis legalization was associated with higher TPCIR (β-estimate = 1.51 (0.68, 2.35), P = 0.0004) and cannabis-liberal regimes were associated with higher time:TPCIR interaction (β-estimate = 1.87 × 10(− 4), (2.9 × 10(− 5), 2.45 × 10(− 4)), P = 0.0208). 33/56 minimum e-Values were > 5 and 6 were infinite. CONCLUSION: Data confirm a close relationship across space and lagged time between cannabis and TPCIR which was robust to adjustment, supported by inverse probability weighting procedures and accompanied by high e-Values making confounding unlikely and establishing the causal relationship. Cannabis-liberal jurisdictions were associated with higher rates of TPCIR and a faster rate of TPCIR increase. Data inform the broader general consideration of cannabinoid-induced genotoxicity.

Of the 880 ethics consultations, sixty (6.8 per cent ) involved solid organ transplant, thirty-nine (65.0 per cent) for candidates and twenty-one (35.0 per cent ) for recipients. Ethics consultations were requested for 4.3 per cent of heart, 4.9 per cent of lung, 0.3 per cent of liver, and 0.3 per cent of kidney transplant recipients over the study period. Nurses were more likely to request ethics consultations for recipients than physicians (80.0 per cent vs 20.0 per cent , p = 0.006). The most common reason for consultation among transplant candidates was discussion about intensity of treatment or goals of care after the patient was not or was no longer a transplant candidate. The most common reason for ethics consultation among transplant recipients was disagreement between transplant providers and patients/families/non-transplant healthcare professionals over the appropriate intensity of treatment for recipients. Very few consultations involved questions about appropriate resource allocation. Ethics consultants involved in these cases most often navigated communication challenges between transplant and non-transplant healthcare professionals and patients and families.","Courtwright, Andrew M.; Erler, Kim S.; Bandini, Julia I.; Zwirner, Mary; Cremens, M.

In the present work we have investigated the inhibition mechanism of IKK [Formula: see text] by NAPA by combining computational simulations, in vitro assays and Mass Spectrometry (MS) technique. The kinase in vitro assay was conducted using a recombinant IKK [Formula: see text] and IKKtide, a 20 amino acid peptide substrate derived from IkB [Formula: see text] kinase protein and containing the serine residues Ser32 and Ser36. Phosphorylated peptide production was measured by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS), and the atomic interaction between IKK [Formula: see text] and NAPA has been studied by molecular docking and Molecular Dynamics (MD) approaches. Here we report that NAPA was able to inhibit the IKK [Formula: see text] kinase activity with an IC(50) of 0.5 mM, to decrease the K(m) value from 0.337 mM to 0.402 mM and the V(max) from 0.0257 mM·min [Formula: see text] to 0.0076 mM·min [Formula: see text]. The computational analyses indicate the region between the KD, ULD and SDD domains of IKK [Formula: see text] as the optimal binding site explored by NAPA. Biochemical data indicate that there is a non-significant difference between K(m) and K(i) whereas there is a statistically significant difference between the two V(max) values. This evidence, combined with computational results, consistently indicates that the inhibition is non-competitive, and that the NAPA binding site is different than that of ATP or IKKtide.","Lopreiato, Mariangela; Di Cristofano, Samuele; Cocchiola, Rossana; Mariano, Alessia; Guerrizio, Libera; Scandurra, Roberto; Mosca, Luciana; Raimondo, Domenico; d’Abusco, Anna Scotto",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7915277/,282

15872,Perception of Women with Lived Experience of Domestic Violence and Abuse on the Involvement of the Dental Team in Supporting Adult Patients with Lived Experience of Domestic Abuse in England: A Pilot Study,2021-02-19,"ABSTRACT: Caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) is an infectious chronic disease responsible for economic losses in sheep and goat breeding worldwide. CLA has no effective treatment, evidencing the vaccination schedule as the best control strategy. Although some commercial vaccines have been available, none of them provides total protection, which is sometimes insufficient and does not reach the same efficiency when compared in sheep and goats. They also have questionable safety levels and side effects. In light of this, several experimental vaccines are in development in order to improve safety, reproducibility, and protective immune response against the etiologic agent of CLA, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. In this review, we discussed aspects as antigen, adjuvant, routes of administration, protection level, and animal models used in CLA vaccine development, as well the challenges and future perspectives. KEY POINTS: Caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) does not have an appropriate commercial vaccine. Different experimental vaccines are in development aiming to protect against Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. An ideal vaccine for CLA is necessary for the disease control.","de Pinho, Rodrigo Barros; de Oliveira Silva, Mara Thais; Bezerra, Francisco Silvestre Brilhante; Borsuk, Sibele",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7923401/,282

Fmoc-protected β-SAAs [e.g. Fmoc-RibAFU(ip)-OH] are indeed useful Lego elements, ready to use for SPPS. The removal of 1,2-OH isopropylidene protecting group increasing the hydrophilicity of such SAA is presented here. We first used N(3)-RibAFU(ip)-OH model compound to optimize mild deprotection conditions. The formation of the 1,2-OH free product N(3)-RibAFU-OH and its methyl glycoside methyl ester, N(3)-RibAFU(Me)-OMe were monitored by RP-HPLC and found that either 50% TFA or 8 eqv. Amberlite IR-120 H(+) resin in MeOH are optimal reagents for the effective deprotection. These conditions were then successfully applied for the synthesis of chimeric oligopeptide: -GG-X-GG- [X=RibAFU(ip)]. We found the established conditions to be effective and—at the same time—sufficiently mild to remove 1,2-O-isopropylidene protection and thus, it is proposed to be used in the synthesis of oligo- and polypeptides of complex sequence combination.

QoL (SF-12, CLDQ-NAFLD) and coping strategies (COPE-28) were evaluated in 307 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients with absence or presence of diabetes or obesity. QoL was compared with normality tables for the general Spanish population. Interactive effects were found in physical functioning (p = 0.008), role-physical (p = 0.016) and activity (p = 0.014). Diabetic patients reported worse scores when they were also obese and vice versa, that is, obese patients scored worse when they were also diabetic. Both diabetic and obese patients had lower QoL than those without metabolic pathology or the general population, and obese patients also reported more passive/avoidance coping. Active coping, positive reframing and acceptance predicted better QoL, while denial, self-blame, self-distraction, disengagement and religion predicted lower QoL. In conclusion, diabetes and obesity were associated with lower QoL in patients with NAFLD. Obesity was also associated with more passive/avoidance coping. Furthermore, passive/avoidance coping strategies predicted lower QoL than active, recommending modification of maladaptive coping strategies in future multidisciplinary NAFLD treatments.","Funuyet-Salas, Jesús; Pérez-San-Gregorio, María Ángeles; Martín-Rodríguez, Agustín; Romero-Gómez, Manuel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8036804/,282

Despite higher basal stress, red blood cells (RBCs) from eligible donors that are heterozygous for beta-thalassemia traits (βThal(+)) possess a differential nitrogen-related metabolism, and cope better with storage stress compared to the control. Nevertheless, not much is known about how storage impacts the proteome of membrane and extracellular vesicles (EVs) in βThal(+). For this purpose, RBC units from twelve βThal(+) donors were studied through proteomics, immunoblotting, electron microscopy, and functional ELISA assays, versus units from sex- and aged-matched controls. βThal(+) RBCs exhibited less irreversible shape modifications. Their membrane proteome was characterized by different levels of structural, lipid raft, transport, chaperoning, redox, and enzyme components. The most prominent findings include the upregulation of myosin proteoforms, arginase-1, heat shock proteins, and protein kinases, but the downregulation of nitrogen-related transporters. The unique membrane proteome was also mirrored, in part, to that of βThal(+) EVs. Network analysis revealed interesting connections of membrane vesiculation with storage and stress hemolysis, along with proteome control modulators of the RBC membrane. Our findings, which are in line with the mild but consistent oxidative stress these cells experience in vivo, provide insight into the physiology and aging of stored βThal(+) RBCs.","Tzounakas, Vassilis L.; Anastasiadi, Alkmini T.; Dzieciatkowska, Monika; Karadimas, Dimitrios G.; Stamoulis, Konstantinos; Papassideri, Issidora S.; Hansen, Kirk C.; D’Alessandro, Angelo; Kriebardis, Anastasios G.; Antonelou, Marianna H.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8037027/,282

Among these, 3-methylpentyl(4-sulfamoylphenyl)carbamate (MSPC) stood out as the most potent compound with ED(50) values of 13 mg/kg (i.p.) and 28 mg/kg (p.o.) in the rat maximal electroshock test (MES). 3-Methylpropyl(4-sulfamoylphenyl)carbamate (MBPC), reported and characterized here, is an MSPC analogous compound with two less aliphatic carbon atoms in its structure. As both MSPC and MBPC are chiral compounds, here, we studied the carbonic anhydrase inhibitory and anticonvulsant action of both MBPC enantiomers in comparison to those of MSPC as well as their pharmacokinetic properties. Racemic-MBPC and its enantiomers showed anticonvulsant activity in the rat maximal electroshock (MES) test with ED(50) values in the range of 19–39 mg/kg. (R)-MBPC had a 65% higher clearance than its enantiomer and, consequently, a lower plasma exposure (AUC) than (S)-MSBC and racemic-MSBC. Nevertheless, (S)-MBPC had a slightly better brain permeability than (R)-MBPC with a brain-to-plasma (AUC) ratio of 1.32 (S-enantiomer), 1.49 (racemate), and 1.27 (R-enantiomer). This may contribute to its better anticonvulsant-ED(50) value. The clearance of MBPC enantiomers was more enantioselective than the brain permeability and MES-ED(50) values, suggesting that their anticonvulsant activity might be due to multiple mechanisms of action.","Odi, Reem; Bibi, David; Shusterman, Bella; Erenburg, Natalia; Shaul, Chanan; Supuran, Claudiu T.; Nocentini, Alessio; Bialer, Meir",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8037586/,282

17015,"Thai Older People’s Willingness (Intention) to Participate in a Care Prevention, Community Group Exercise Program: An Assessment before Implementing an Intervention Trial in Chiang Mai, Northern Thailand",2021-04-12,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Macrophages play a central role in innate immune response to both infectious and non-infectious stressors. They respond to different agonists modifying their phenotype and functions. In humans and mice, the regulatory cytokines IL-10 or TGF-β are both known to drive macrophage polarization into an anti-inflammatory phenotype, referred to as M2c. However, the immune systems of animal species each have their own peculiarities and the M2c subsets has never been investigated in pigs. A deep knowledge of the porcine immune system is required to design vaccines or control strategies against pathogens, which are a major constraint to pork production. Due to anatomical, physiological, and immunological similarities, swine are attracting increasing attention as a model for human diseases. To better characterize porcine macrophages, we evaluated the effects of IL-10 or TGF-β on the phenotype and function of monocyte-derived macrophages. Both cytokines downregulated the expression of MHC II DR and CD14. IL-10, but not TGF-β, statistically significantly reduced the ability of macrophages to respond to Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) or TLR4 agonists. Whilst these data suggest differentiation to an M2c-like immunosuppressive phenotype, the responses, and differences between IL-10 and TGF-β also reveals species-specific differences. ABSTRACT: Macrophages are phagocytic cells involved in maintaining tissue homeostasis and defense against pathogens. Macrophages may be polarized into different functionally specialized subsets. M2c macrophages arise following stimulation with IL-10 or TGF-β and mediate anti-inflammatory and tissue repair functions. M2c macrophages remain poorly characterized in the pig, thus we investigated the impact of these regulatory cytokines on porcine monocyte-derived macrophages (moMΦ). The phenotype and functionality of these cells was characterized though confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, ELISA, and RT-qPCR. Both cytokines induced CD14 and MHC II DR down-regulation and reduced IL-6, TNF-α, and CD14 expression, suggestive of an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Interestingly, neither IL-10 or TGF-β were able to trigger IL-10 induction or release by moMΦ. Differences between these cytokines were observed: stimulation with IL-10, but not TGF-β, induced up-regulation of both CD16 and CD163 on moMΦ. In addition, IL-10 down-regulated expression of IL-1β and IL-12p40 4h post-stimulation and induced a stronger impairment of moMΦ ability to respond to either TLR2 or TLR4 agonists. Overall, our results provide an overview of porcine macrophage polarization by two immunosuppressive cytokines, revealing differences between IL-10 and TGF-β, and reporting some peculiarity of swine, which should be considered in translational studies.","Carta, Tania; Razzuoli, Elisabetta; Fruscione, Floriana; Zinellu, Susanna; Meloni, Dionigia; Anfossi, Antonio; Chessa, Bernardo; Dei Giudici, Silvia; Graham, Simon P.; Oggiano, Annalisa; Franzoni, Giulia",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8069609/,282

Here, we applied contrast enhancement algorithms based on peripheral equalization and calcification emphasis on X-ray images to improve the detection of Sitophilus zeamais in maize grains. In addition, we proposed an approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identity non-infested and infested classes using three different architectures; (i) Inception-ResNet-v2, (ii) Xception and (iii) MobileNetV2. In general, the prediction models developed based on the MobileNetV2 and Xception architectures achieved higher accuracy (≥0.88) in identifying non-infested grains and grains infested by maize weevil, with a correct classification from 0.78 to 1.00 for validation and test sets. Hence, the proposed approach using enhanced radiographs has the potential to provide precise control of Sitophilus zeamais for safe human consumption of maize grains.

Social isolation is a challenging and persistent issue experienced by many older adults, especially among immigrant and refugee seniors. Unique risk factors such as racism, discrimination, language barriers, weak social networks, and separation from friends and family predispose immigrant and refugee seniors to a higher risk of social isolation. The pandemic has magnified the unique risks and has highlighted the differential health and economic impacts. This article examines social isolation among immigrant and refugee seniors in Canada by focusing on the policy context, available programs and services to reduce social isolation, and the conceptualization and measurement considerations for advancing research to address social isolation among this growing population. Drawing on specific examples, we discuss immigration, aging, and social isolation within the context of Canada. While our article focuses on Canada as a case study, our discussion has relevancy and implications for other high-income countries with aging immigrant and refugee populations. In moving forward, we argue that a more complete and targeted understanding of social isolation is essential to informing program and policy development to support immigrant and refugee seniors in Canada and beyond.

Most Siglecs function as transmembrane receptors mainly expressed on blood cells in a cell type-specific manner. They recognize and bind sialic acids in specific linkages on glycoproteins and glycolipids. Since Sia is a self-molecule, Siglecs play a role in innate immune responses by distinguishing molecules as self or non-self. Increasing evidence supports the involvement of Siglecs in immune signaling representing immune checkpoints able to regulate immune responses in inflammatory diseases as well as cancer. Although further studies are necessary to fully understand the involvement of Siglecs in pathological conditions as well as their interactions with other immune regulators, the development of therapeutic approaches that exploit these molecules represents a tremendous opportunity for future treatments of several human diseases, as demonstrated by their application in several clinical trials.

To investigate the effect of CARD9 in neurotropic virus infection, CARD9(−/−) and corresponding C57BL/6 wild-type control mice were infected with Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). Brain tissue was analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular analyses, and spleens by flow cytometry. To determine the impact of CARD9 deficiency on T cell responses in vitro, antigen presentation assays were utilized. Genetic ablation of CARD9 enhanced early pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and accelerated infiltration of T and B cells in the brain, together with a transient increase in TMEV-infected cells in the hippocampus. CARD9(−/−) mice showed an increased loss of neuronal nuclear protein(+) mature neurons and doublecortin(+) neuronal precursor cells and an increase in β-amyloid precursor protein(+) damaged axons in the hippocampus. No effect of CARD9 deficiency was found on the initiation of CD8(+) T cell responses by flow cytometry and co-culture experiments using virus-exposed dendritic cells or microglia-enriched glial cell mixtures, respectively.

19350,Sustainability of Household Food Waste Reduction: A Fresh Insight on Youth’s Emotional and Cognitive Behaviors,2021-06-30,"Low-voltage areas (LVAs) are commonly considered surrogate markers for an arrhythmogenic substrate underlying tachyarrhythmias. It remains challenging to define a proper threshold to classify LVA, and it is unknown whether unipolar, bipolar, and the recently introduced omnipolar voltage mapping techniques are complementary or contradictory in classifying LVAs. Therefore, this study examined similarities and dissimilarities in unipolar, bipolar, and omnipolar voltage mapping and explored the relation between various types of voltages and conduction velocity (CV). METHODS: Intraoperative epicardial mapping (interelectrode distance 2 mm, ±1900 sites) was performed during sinus rhythm in 21 patients (48±13 years, 9 male) with atrial volume overload. Cliques of 4 electrodes (2×2 mm) were used to calculate the maximal unipolar, bipolar, and omnipolar voltages and mean CV. Areas with maximal bipolar or omnipolar clique voltage ≤0.5 mV were defined as LVA. RESULTS: The maximal unipolar clique voltage was not only larger than maximal bipolar clique voltage but also larger than maximal omnipolar clique voltage (7.08 [4.22–10.59] mV versus 5.27 [2.39–9.56] mV and 5.77 [2.58–10.52] mV, respectively, P<0.001). In addition, the largest bipolar clique voltage was on average 1.66 (range: 1.0–59.0) times larger to the corresponding perpendicular bipolar voltage pair. LVAs identified by a bipolar or omnipolar threshold corresponded to a broad spectrum of unipolar voltages and, although CV was generally decreased, still high CVs and large unipolar voltages were found in these LVAs. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with atrial volume overload, there were considerable discrepancies in the different types of LVAs. Additionally, the identification of LVAs was hampered by considerable directional differences in bipolar voltages. Even using directional independent omnipolar voltage to identify LVAs, high CVs and large unipolar voltages are present within these areas. Therefore, a combination of low unipolar and low omnipolar voltage may be more indicative of true LVAs.","van Schie, Mathijs S.; Kharbanda, Rohit K.; Houck, Charlotte A.; Lanters, Eva A.H.; Taverne, Yannick J.H.J.; Bogers, Ad J.J.C.; de Groot, Natasja M.S.",Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294660/,282

The IPAQ and CUBRECAVI scales were applied to a sample of 257 women between 61 and 93 years old (M = 69.44, SD = 4.61). Statistically significant outcomes were obtained in functional ability and autonomy according to their level of physical activity (p = 0.001): greater satisfaction and frequency of social relationships with a mild level of physical activity (p = 0.011), and statistically significant differences in the degree of satisfaction with their health according to the level of physical activity they practice (p < 0.001). The results showed that those with high physical activity obtained better levels of functional abilities and autonomy. Additionally, dissatisfaction with one’s own health is associated with low levels of physical activity. In conclusion, it could be said that the practice of mild physical exercise in older women encourages greater autonomy and functional ability for activities of daily living, which results in independence in everyday life in addition to fostering social links as well as gaining a better satisfaction with their own health, with the socio-emotional benefits that this can bring.","Parra-Rizo, María Antonia; Sanchís-Soler, Gema",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8297252/,282

However, intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis is expensive and frequently not available in developing countries. This study aims to summarize the evidence of giving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor in myasthenic crisis. Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases and references were searched for observational studies that determined the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor in myasthenic crisis. The eligibility criteria were as follows: population, patients with myasthenic crisis, intervention (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor administration), and outcome (clinical improvement and complications). In total, 106 studies were identified, 92 through database searching (after removing duplicates) and 14 through other sources. Only eight were analyzed in the present systematic review. In five, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor was given at the start of the crisis, whereas in the other three, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor was discontinued initially and then restarted prior to extubation. Two observational analytic studies and three case reports showed improvement in different outcome measures. In the other three, improvement of outcome measures was also observed. Overall, a small proportion of patients developed cardiac arrhythmia and pneumonia after administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor alone, although this was not statistically different compared with those subjected to plasmapheresis. In summary, continuous intravenous infusion of pyridostigmine or neostigmine can be a substitute for intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis if these are not available during crisis; however, caution should be observed because of the aforementioned possible complications.","Prado, Mario B.; Adiao, Karen Joy",Neurocrit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8297431/,282

We describe a convenient two-step methodology for the alkynylcyclopropanation of alkenes, based on the rhodium(II)-catalyzed decarbenation of 7-alkynyl cycloheptatrienes. The catalytic system employed circumvents a fundamental problem associated with these substrates, which usually evolve via 6-endo-dig cyclization or ring-contraction pathways under metal catalysis. This unique performance unlocks a rapid access to a diverse library of alkynylcyclopropanes (including derivatives of complex drug-like molecules), versatile intermediates that previously required much lengthier synthetic approaches. Combining experiments and DFT calculations, the complete mechanistic picture for the divergent reactivity of alkynylcycloheptatrienes under metal catalysis has been unveiled, rationalizing the unique selectivity displayed by rhodium(II) complexes.","Mato, Mauro; Montesinos-Magraner, Marc; Sugranyes, Arnau R.; Echavarren, Antonio M.",J Am Chem Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8299462/,282

In this work, we developed a food-grade dry larch bark extract (LBE) from sawmill by-products using hydro-alcoholic extraction. The antibacterial activity of LBE was evaluated against respiratory-tract pathogens, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenza, and it was compared to that of grapefruit seed extract (GSE), a commercially available raw material commonly proposed as antibacterial ingredient for over-the-counter products. Procyanidins (PACs) and other polyphenols contents in LBE were determined by HPLC-FLD-MS and HPLC-DAD-MS(n), respectively. The antimicrobial activity of LBE and GSE was assessed using the micro-plate dilution technique in concentration range of 2–200 µg/mL, and the safety of these dosages was assessed in cellular and animal models. LBE showed considerable contents of PACs (15% w/w; especially B-type) and other polyphenols (3.8% w/w), among which the characteristic spiropolyphenols larixinol and epilarixinol were identified, together with the flavonoids isoquercitrin and rutin, already reported as growth inhibitors of different respiratory-tract pathogens. LBE showed higher antimicrobial activity compared to GSE, demonstrated by a growth inhibition range of 10–40% towards five of six strains tested, compared to 10–15% of GSE. These results suggest that LBE may represent a natural and sustainable source of active compounds with antibacterial activity for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications.","Faggian, Marta; Bernabè, Giulia; Ferrari, Sara; Francescato, Stefano; Baratto, Gianni; Castagliuolo, Ignazio; Dall’Acqua, Stefano; Peron, Gregorio",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8300756/,282

We recently demonstrated the in vivo behavioral translation of tweaking the PI3K/Akt signaling, an essential pathway for regulating cellular processes and physiology, and its modulation through aging. Here we describe, for the first time, the in vivo behavioral impact of the sex and genetic-load tweaking this pathway. The anxiety-like phenotypes of 61 mature (11–14-month-old) male and female PDK1 K465E knock-in, heterozygous, and WT mice were studied. Forced (open-field) anxiogenic environmental conditions were sensitive to detect sex and genetic-load differences at middle age. Despite similar neophobia and horizontal activity among the six groups, females exhibited faster ethograms than males, with increased thigmotaxis, increased wall and bizarre rearing. Genotype-load unveiled increased anxiety in males, resembling female performances. The performance of mutants in naturalistic conditions (marble test) was normal. Homozygotic-load was needed for reduced somatic growth only in males. Factor interactions indicated the complex interplay in the elicitation of different negative valence system’s items and the fine-tuning of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway intensity by genotype-load and sex.","Santana-Santana, Mikel; Bayascas, José-Ramón; Giménez-Llort, Lydia",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8301321/,282

However, the dependency structure of correlated parameters was rarely investigated. Knowing the dependence structure helps in finding the probability matrix of the interaction between the parameters. In this research, a novel approach was introduced in psychological analysis using copula functions. For this purpose, the self-esteem and anxiety of 141 university students in Iran were extracted using the Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory and the Zang Anxiety Scale. Then the dependence structure of self-esteem and anxiety were established using copula functions. The Frank copula achieved the best fit for the joint variables of self-esteem and anxiety. Finally, the probability matrix of different classes of anxiety, taking into account self-esteem classes, was extracted. The results indicated that poor self-esteem leads to severe or very severe anxiety, with more than 98% probability, while strong self-esteem may lead to normal and mild anxiety, with about 80% probability. It can be concluded that the method was promising, and that copula functions can open a window to the dependence structure analysis of psychological parameters.","Dehghani, Elham; Ranjbar, Somayeh Hadad; Atashafrooz, Moharram; Negarestani, Hossein; Mosavi, Amir; Kovacs, Levente",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8345746/,282

The consulted databases were PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, EBSCO, and ProQuest. Eligibility criteria allowed the inclusion of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental trials without applying language, country, publication type or time restrictions. The quality of the eligible studies was appraised by the RoB2 tool of Cochrane for RCTs and JBI critical appraisal tools for quasi-experimental trials. Data items were collected based on PICO acronym by two investigators and reviewed for accuracy by a third one. The evidence was narratively synthesized and validated by proceeding with a random model meta-analysis using Cochrane RevMan software(Version 5.4). The quality of the pooled evidence from meta-analysis was assessed using the tool of GRADE. Out of 29,975 retrieved records, 14 studies (six RCTs and eight quasi-experimental trials) were included. The psychoeducational program significantly reduced acculturative stress and enhanced adjustment. In contrast, cultural orientation and peer-pairing programs significantly enhanced adjustment, but could not reduce acculturative stress. In meta-analysis, acculturative stress was significantly reduced in the psychoeducational intervention versus controls [overall pooled size effect = −3.89 (95% CI: −5.42, −2.53) at p < 0.001]. Similarly, adjustment was significantly enhanced in the psychoeducation and socio-cultural interventions versus control [overall pooled size effect = 3.10 (95% CI: 2.35, 3.85) at p < 0.001]. In conclusion, the psychoeducational program demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing acculturative stress and enhancing adjustment compared to the other interventional programs. However, socio-cultural programs have still been effective in enhancing adjustment.

19827,"How Does Being Solo in Nature Affect Well-Being? Evidence from Norway, Germany and New Zealand",2021-07-26,"Context: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an emerging treatment for improving psychological well-being. Objective: To summarize research evaluating the effects of ACT on psychological well-being in children with special health care needs (SHCN) and their parents. Data Sources: An electronic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid/EMBASE and PsycINFO (January 2000–April 2021). Study Selection: Included were studies that assessed ACT in children with SHCN (ages 0–17y) and/or parents of children with SHCN and had a comparator group. Data Extraction: Descriptive data were synthesized and presented in a tabular format, and data on relevant outcomes (e.g., depressive symptoms, stress, avoidance and fusion) were used in the meta-analyses to explore the effectiveness of ACT (administered independently with no other psychological therapy) compared to no treatment. Results: Ten studies were identified (child (7) and parent (3)). In children with SHCN, ACT was more effective than no treatment at helping depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] = −4.27, 95% CI: −5.20, −3.34; p < 0.001) and avoidance and fusion (SMD = −1.64, 95% CI: −3.24, −0.03; p = 0.05), but not stress. In parents of children with SHCN, ACT may help psychological inflexibility (SMD = −0.77, 95% CI: −1.07, −0.47; p < 0.01). Limitations: There was considerable statistical heterogeneity in three of the six meta-analyses. Conclusions: There is some evidence that ACT may help with depressive symptoms in children with SHCN and psychological inflexibility in their parents. Research on the efficacy of ACT for a variety of children with SHCN and their parents is especially limited, and future research is needed.","Parmar, Arpita; Esser, Kayla; Barreira, Lesley; Miller, Douglas; Morinis, Leora; Chong, Yuen-Yu; Smith, Wanda; Major, Nathalie; Church, Paige; Cohen, Eyal; Orkin, Julia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8345967/,282

Anxiety level has been associated with osteoporosis, but its role on bone mineral density (BMD) change is still unknown. This study aimed to investigate the association between anxiety levels and both adherence and treatment response to oral bisphosphonates (BPs) in postmenopausal osteoporosis. BMD and anxiety levels were evaluated trough dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), respectively. Participants received weekly medication with alendronate or risedronate and were grouped according to the HAM-A scores into tertiles (HAM-A 3 > HAM-A 2 > HAM-A 1). After 24 months, BMD changes were different among the HAM-A tertiles. The median lumbar BMD change was significantly greater in both the HAM-A 2 and HAM-A 3 in comparison with the HAM-A 1. The same trend was observed for femoral BMD change. Adherence to BPs was >75% in 68% of patients in the HAM-A 1, 79% of patients in the HAM-A 2, and 89% of patients in the HAM-A 3 (p = 0.0014). After correcting for age, body mass index, depressive symptoms, and the 10-yr. probability of osteoporotic fractures, anxiety levels independently predicted lumbar BMD change (β = 0.3417, SE 0.145, p = 0.02). In conclusion, women with higher anxiety levels reported greater BMD improvement, highlighting that anxiety was associated with adherence and response to osteoporosis medical treatment, although further research on this topic is needed.","Martino, Gabriella; Bellone, Federica; Vicario, Carmelo M.; Gaudio, Agostino; Caputo, Andrea; Corica, Francesco; Squadrito, Giovanni; Schwarz, Peter; Morabito, Nunziata; Catalano, Antonino",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8346074/,282

This study deals with the design and synthesis of new glycyrrhetinic acid (GA)–amino acid peptides and peptide ester derivatives. The structures of the new derivatives were established through various spectral and microanalytical data. The novel compounds were screened for their in vitro cytotoxic activity. The evaluation results showed that the new peptides produced promising cytotoxic activity against the human breast MCF-7 cancer cell line while comparing to doxorubicin. On the other hand, only compounds 3, 5, and 7 produced potent activity against human colon HCT-116 cancer cell line. The human liver cancer (HepG-2) cell line represented a higher sensitivity to peptide 7 (IC(50); 3.30 μg/mL), while it appeared insensitive to the rest of the tested peptides. Furthermore, compounds 1, 3, and 5 exhibited a promising safety profile against human normal skin fibroblasts cell line BJ-1. In order to investigate the mode of action, compound 5 was selected as a representative example to study its in vitro effect against the apoptotic parameters and Bax/BCL-2/p53/caspase-7/caspase-3/tubulin, and DNA fragmentation to investigate beta (TUBb). Additionally, all the new analogues were subjected to antimicrobial assay against a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and the yeast candida Albicans. All the tested GA analogues 1–8 exhibited more antibacterial effect against Micrococcus Luteus than gentamicin, but they exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against the tested bacterial and yeast strains. Molecular docking studies were also simulated for compound 5 to give better rationalization and put insight to the features of its structure.","Moustafa, Gaber O.; Shalaby, Ahmed; Naglah, Ahmed M.; Mounier, Marwa M.; El-Sayed, Heba; Anwar, Manal M.; Nossier, Eman S.",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8346995/,282

(2) Study Design: The study was based on the 2016 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) survey. The sample consisted of 7191 rural residents over 18 in China. (3) Methods: The article measured physical neighborhood environment from the two aspects of dwelling environment (DE) and public facilities convenience (PFC), and social neighborhood environment from public security (PS) and neighborhood relationship (NR). Associations between health status/health-related behaviors and self-perceived physical/social neighborhood environment were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics. (4) Results: The results suggested that rural residents who live in a good neighborhood environment reported having a better health status. Specifically, rural residents who reported living in good DE were less likely to have a depressive mood and poor health conditions. Those who reported good PFC were less likely to have depressive mood, poor self-rated health and chronic diseases. Rural residents who reported having good PS were less likely to have a depressive mood. Those who reported good NR were less likely to have a depressive mood, poor self-rated health, chronic diseases and obesity. Regarding neighborhood environment and health-related behaviors, the results showed that rural residents who reported good PFC were more likely to do physical exercise. Notably, the regression results of the education level variable showed that education level significantly promoted the health-related behaviors (time sleeping weekday, physical exercise and smoking) of rural residents. (5) Conclusions: This article suggested that there was strong evidence for a relationship between physical and social neighborhood environment and the general health of rural residents due to all causes. According to the conclusion of this article, in order to improve the health of rural residents, policy interventions should give priority to improving the neighborhood environment. In addition, the improvement in the degree that rural residents are exposed to education is of the same importance, which helps more rural residents to maintain good health-related behaviors.","Liu, Pengcheng; Wang, Jing; Wang, Xiaojie; Nie, Wenjie; Zhen, Fangfang",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8391976/,282

It has been reported that H(2) has no side effects, unlike conventional antitumor drugs, and that it is effective against many diseases caused by oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Recently, there has been an increasing number of papers on the efficacy of H(2) against cancer and its effects in mitigating the side effects of cancer treatment. In this review, we demonstrate the efficacy and safety of H(2) as a novel antitumor agent and show that its mechanisms may not only involve the direct scavenging of ·OH, but also other indirect biological defense mechanisms via the regulation of gene expression.","Hirano, Shin-ichi; Yamamoto, Haru; Ichikawa, Yusuke; Sato, Bunpei; Takefuji, Yoshiyasu; Satoh, Fumitake",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8395776/,282

However, variable results have been obtained, mainly due to the effect of the microenvironment on the induction, increase, and maintenance of MSC immunoregulatory mechanisms. In addition, the importance of cell–cell contact for MSCs to efficiently modulate the immune response has recently been highlighted. Because these interactions would be difficult to achieve in the physiological context, the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their participation as intermediaries of communication between MSCs and immune cells becomes relevant. Therefore, this article focuses on analyzing immunoregulatory mechanisms mediated by cell contact, highlighting the importance of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and the participation of EVs. Moreover, the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), the main cytokines involved in MSC activation, are examined. These cytokines, when used at the appropriate concentrations and times, would promote increases in the expression of immunoregulatory molecules in the cell and allow the acquisition of EVs enriched with these molecules. The establishment of certain in vitro activation guidelines will facilitate the design of conditioning protocols to obtain functional MSCs or EVs in different pathophysiological conditions.","López-García, Lucero; Castro-Manrreza, Marta E.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8431422/,282

For prostate cancer (PCa) patients considered for carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT), pre-treatment CRC screening is performed empirically to avoid post-treatment colonoscopic manipulation. However, the outcomes of screening remain unclear. To address this, we analyzed the outcomes of 2412 PCa patients at average risk for CRC who underwent routine pre-CIRT CRC screening and found that the estimated CRC prevalence was greater than that reported by 17 previous large-scale screening studies analyzing average-risk adults. These data indicate the possibility that the prevalence of CRC in PCa patients is greater than that in general average-risk adults, warranting further research. ABSTRACT: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is effective for detecting cancer in average-risk adults. For prostate cancer (PCa) patients considered for carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT), pre-treatment CRC screening is performed empirically to avoid post-treatment colonoscopic manipulation. However, the outcomes of screening this population remain unclear. Here, we compared the outcomes of routine pre-CIRT CRC screening of 2412 PCa patients at average risk for CRC with data from two published datasets: the Japan National Cancer Registry (JNCR) and a series of 17 large-scale screening studies analyzing average-risk adults. The estimated prevalence rate was calculated using the pooled sensitivity elucidated by a previous meta-analysis. Consequently, 28 patients (1.16%) were diagnosed with CRC. CRC morbidity was significantly associated with high pre-treatment levels of prostate-specific antigen (p = 0.023). The screening positivity rate in this study cohort exceeded the annual incidence reported in the JNCR for most age brackets. Furthermore, the estimated prevalence rate in this study cohort (1.46%) exceeded that reported in all 17 large-scale studies, making the result an outlier (p = 0.005). These data indicate the possibility that the prevalence of CRC in PCa patients is greater than that in general average-risk adults, warranting further research in a prospective setting.","Kobayashi, Nao; Oike, Takahiro; Kubo, Nobuteru; Miyasaka, Yuhei; Mizukami, Tatsuji; Sato, Hiro; Adachi, Akiko; Katoh, Hiroyuki; Kawamura, Hidemasa; Ohno, Tatsuya",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8431542/,282

Cumulative analyses of hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were conducted. The primary endpoint was intravesical recurrence-free survival (IVRFS), with the secondary endpoints being cancer-specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS), and metastasis-free survival (MFS). Results: Among a total of 5489 patients included in the sixteen selected papers, 2387 (43.4%) underwent diagnostic URS before RNU and 3102 (56.6%) did not. Pre-RNU diagnostic URS was significantly associated with worse IVRFS after RNU (HR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.29–1.61, p < 0.001) than RNU alone. However, subgroup analysis including patients without biopsy during URS revealed no significant impact of diagnostic URS on IVRFS (HR = 1.28, 95% CI: 0.90–1.80, p = 0.16). The results of other analyses showed no significant differences in CSS (HR = 0.94, p = 0.63), OS (HR: 0.94, p = 0.56), and MFS (HR: 0.91, p = 0.37) between patients who underwent URS before RNU and those who did not. Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis confirm that diagnostic URS prior to RNU is significantly associated with worse IVRFS, albeit with no concurrent impact on the other long-term survival outcomes. Our results indicate that URS has a negative impact on IVRFS only when combined with endoscopic biopsy. Future studies are warranted to assess the role of immediate postoperative intravesical chemotherapy in patients undergoing biopsy during URS for suspected UTUC.","Nowak, Łukasz; Krajewski, Wojciech; Chorbińska, Joanna; Kiełb, Paweł; Sut, Michał; Moschini, Marco; Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun; Mori, Keiichiro; Giudice, Francesco Del; Laukhtina, Ekaterina; Lonati, Chiara; Kaliszewski, Krzysztof; Małkiewicz, Bartosz; Szydełko, Tomasz",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8465597/,282
44422,"Postponed Dental Appointments Due to Costs Are Associated with Increased Loneliness—Evidence from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe",2021-01-05,"PURPOSE: No study has been evaluated pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of β-lactam antibiotics in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), not requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). We evaluated the time that plasma concentrations remain above four times the MIC (ft > 4MIC) and PK parameters of meropenem in this population. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized clinical trial (RCT), all patients received standard dose (3 g daily) of meropenem for 48 h, then randomly allocated in standard or adjusted groups. The standard group received meropenem without dose adjustment. In the adjusted group, the meropenem dose was adjusted based on the Cockcroft-Gault(C-G) equation. Meropenem concentrations were measured at the peak and trough times on the 2nd and 5th days of the study. RESULTS: On the 2nd day of the study, 3 out of 10 (30%) of patients attained the PD target (≥ 80%ft > 4MIC). In the 5th day of the study, the PD target was attained in 2 out of 10 (20%) and 1 out of 5 (20%) of patients who received standard and adjusted doses of meropenem, respectively (p = 1). In all samples, increased volume of distribution (Vd) (median; IQR) (46.04; 23.06–103.18 L), terminal half-life (T1/2) (4.51; 2.67–8.88 h) and decreased clearance (6.52; 4.43–10.16 L/h) have been shown. CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with AKI, who not receive RRT, standard doses, and adjusted according to renal function of meropenem failed to achieve PD target of ≥ 80%ft > 4MIC. Higher doses are required for this target. RETROSPECTIVELY REGISTERED: The study protocol with registered retrospectively and approved on January 19, 2019, with the number of IRCT20160412027346N5.

Leading anthropological thinkers and fellow ethnographically committed social scientists eschew the conceptual confusion between equality—of opportunity, of access, of the right to compete for whatever goal one chooses to pursue—and levelling. The discussions develop in the belief that old and emerging forms of social and economic inequality in urban settings need to be addressed on the ground and in depth, as does the machinery that operates behind oppression to sustain power and inequality. This collective effort is intended to produce an in-depth understanding of the empirical processes that mark this greatly varied and theoretically complex field of enquiry across different settings, helping to address comparatively urban socio-economic, cultural and political forms of inequality.","Pardo, Italo; Prato, Giuliana B.",Urban Inequalities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991519/,282

Evidence from a Large Sample of University Professors,2021-03-15,"The past decades of environmental education (EE) scholarship have been marked by strong critiques of how neoliberal policies and reform efforts have contributed to an erosion of valuing the gravity of our human dependencies on the health of diverse species and ecosystems on the planet. In this chapter, the author argues that environmental educators maintain the importance of valuing and acting in defense of diversity as a core foundation of democratic life and acknowledges that EE researchers and environmental educators are committed to the possibilities of addressing the cultural roots of social justice and sustainability in a myriad of scholar-activist ways. Considering the stark conditions for life on the planet due to climate change, poverty, famine, and increased violent conflict, this chapter argues that scholar-activist environmental educators are more than ever presented with the challenge of rethinking EE and doing so with close attention to what can be done differently. In this book chapter, Lupinacci introduces an ecocritical framework for EE with a focus on working with PreK-12 and higher education teachers. Recognizing the need for ecocritical pedagogies that challenge status quo relationships between EE, teacher preparation, and higher education, the chapter critically addresses and rethinks current dominant conceptual frameworks constituting classrooms, schools, and communities. Furthermore, the author shares how anthropocentrism in connection with assumptions of human supremacy become a distinguishable focal point for ecocritical pedagogies. Concluding, Lupinacci shares some actions toward a shift from egotism to ecotism in enacting ecotistical pedagogies with(in) EE and teacher education.","Lupinacci, John",Towards Critical Environmental Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991554/,282

It is similar in design to a previous scheme by Couveignes, Rostovtsev and Stolbunov, but aims at an improved balance between efficiency and security. In the proposal, the authors suggest concrete parameters in order to meet some desired levels of quantum security. These parameters are based on the hardness of recovering a hidden isogeny between two elliptic curves, using a quantum subexponential algorithm of Childs, Jao and Soukharev. This algorithm combines two building blocks: first, a quantum algorithm for recovering a hidden shift in a commutative group. Second, a computation in superposition of all isogenies originating from a given curve, which the algorithm calls as a black box. In this paper, we give a comprehensive security analysis of CSIDH. Our first step is to revisit three quantum algorithms for the abelian hidden shift problem from the perspective of non-asymptotic cost, with trade-offs between their quantum and classical complexities. Second, we complete the non-asymptotic study of the black box in the hidden shift algorithm. We give a quantum procedure that evaluates CSIDH-512 using less than 40 000 logical qubits. This allows us to show that the parameters proposed by the authors of CSIDH do not meet their expected quantum security.","Bonnetain, Xavier; Schrottenloher, André",Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991670/,282
50805,Assessing Approaches of Human Inhalation Exposure to Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: A Review,2021-03-18,"The right of an individual to request the deletion of their personal data by an entity that might be storing it – referred to as the right to be forgotten – has been explicitly recognized, legislated, and exercised in several jurisdictions across the world, including the European Union, Argentina, and California. However, much of the discussion surrounding this right offers only an intuitive notion of what it means for it to be fulfilled – of what it means for such personal data to be deleted. In this work, we provide a formal definitional framework for the right to be forgotten using tools and paradigms from cryptography. In particular, we provide a precise definition of what could be (or should be) expected from an entity that collects individuals’ data when a request is made of it to delete some of this data. Our framework captures most, though not all, relevant aspects of typical systems involved in data processing. While it cannot be viewed as expressing the statements of current laws (especially since these are rather vague in this respect), our work offers technically precise definitions that represent possibilities for what the law could reasonably expect, and alternatives for what future versions of the law could explicitly require. Finally, with the goal of demonstrating the applicability of our framework and definitions, we consider various natural and simple scenarios where the right to be forgotten comes up. For each of these scenarios, we highlight the pitfalls that arise even in genuine attempts at implementing systems offering deletion guarantees, and also describe technological solutions that provably satisfy our definitions. These solutions bring together techniques built by various communities.","Garg, Sanjam; Goldwasser, Shafi; Vasudevan, Prashant Nalini",Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991675/,282

If the lists are unbounded, the best classical (exponential) time complexity has withstood since Wagner’s CRYPTO 2002 paper. If the lists are bounded (of the same size) and such that there is a single solution, the dissection algorithms of Dinur et al. (CRYPTO 2012) improve the memory usage over a simple meet-in-the-middle. In this paper, we study quantum algorithms for the k-xor problem. With unbounded lists and quantum access, we improve previous work by Grassi et al. (ASIACRYPT 2018) for almost all k. Next, we extend our study to lists of any size and with classical access only. We define a set of “merging trees” which represent the best known strategies for quantum and classical merging in k-xor algorithms, and prove that our method is optimal among these. Our complexities are confirmed by a Mixed Integer Linear Program that computes the best strategy for a given k-xor problem. All our algorithms apply also when considering modular additions instead of bitwise xors. This framework enables us to give new improved quantum k-xor algorithms for all k and list sizes. Applications include the subset-sum problem, LPN with limited memory and the multiple-encryption problem.","Naya-Plasencia, María; Schrottenloher, André",Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991677/,282

The species diversity of medicinal plants in general, as well as those used to treat diseases of various classes, is determined. A statistical analysis of the relationships between the number of species of medicinal plants in regional biomes and climatic indices is carried out; the corresponding thematic schematic maps are constructed and analyzed. It is shown that the number of medicinal-plant species is related to the total biome species number. This, in turn, is determined by the geographic location, which determines the average annual temperature and precipitation in the regions. The closest established relationship was between the number of medicinal-plant species and the average annual air temperatures. A relatively high relationship was found between the species number and the average annual precipitation. In the analysis of the relationship between the number of medicinal-plant species used to treat certain classes of diseases and the climatic factors, the picture turned out to be similar.","Dikareva, T.

56120,Correlations between Changes in Medical Opioid Dispensing and Contributions of Fentanyl to Opioid-Related Overdose Fatalities: Exploratory Analyses from Canada,2021-07-14,"OBJECTIVE: Conservative oxygen strategy is recommended in acute illness while its benefit in ICU patients remains controversial. Therefore, we sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine such oxygen strategies’ effect and safety in ICU patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane database from inception to Feb 15, 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a conservative oxygen strategy to a conventional strategy in critically ill patients were included. Results were expressed as mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The primary outcome was the longest follow-up mortality. Heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias were also investigated to test the robustness of the primary outcome. RESULTS: We included seven trials with a total of 5265 patients. In general, the conventional group had significantly higher SpO(2) or PaO(2) than that in the conservative group. No statistically significant differences were found in the longest follow-up mortality (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.97–1.10; I(2)=18%; P=0.34) between the two oxygen strategies when pooling studies enrolling subjects with various degrees of hypoxemia. Further sensitivity analysis showed that ICU patients with mild-to-moderate hypoxemia (PaO(2)/FiO(2) >100 mmHg) had significantly lower mortality (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05–1.46; I(2)=0%; P=0.01) when receiving conservative oxygen therapy. These findings were also confirmed in other study periods. Additional, secondary outcomes of the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of stay in the ICU and hospital, change in sequential organ failure assessment score, and adverse events were comparable between the two strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that conservative oxygen therapy strategy did not improve the prognosis of the overall ICU patients. The subgroup of ICU patients with mild to moderate hypoxemia might obtain prognosis benefit from such a strategy without affecting other critical clinical results.

The US guideline prioritizes both the added efficacy and cost implications of non-statin therapy, which limits intensive therapy to individuals with the highest risk of ASCVD The European approach broadens the eligibility criteria by incorporating goals of therapy in both primary and secondary prevention The current cost and access constraints of healthcare worldwide, especially amidst a COVID-19 pandemic, makes the European recommendations more challenging to implement By restricting non-statin therapy to a subgroup of high- and, in particular, very high-risk individuals, the US guideline provides primary and secondary ASCVD prevention recommendations that are more affordable and attainable Ultimately, finding a common ground for both guidelines rests on our ability to design trials that assess cost-effectiveness in addition to efficacy and safety","Feldman, David I.; Michos, Erin D.; Stone, Neil J.; Gluckman, Ty J.; Cainzos-Achirica, Miguel Virani Salim S.; Blumenthal, Roger S.",American Journal of Preventive Cardiology,,282

Cancer patients are more susceptible to infection and tumor history is defined as an important factor of poor prognosis, which challenges both doctors and patients. For metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, maintenance therapy is the optimal choice. The patients with tumor progression or poor biological behaviorshould receive or or continue combination chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy should reduce the intensity of treatment and shorten the therapy time. Fever patients during chemotherapy need to receive differential diagnosis and screening according to national standards.

209218,COVID-19-Related Factors Associated with Sleep Disturbance and Suicidal Thoughts among the Taiwanese Public: A Facebook Survey,2020,"Growing up in a bilingual environment is becoming increasingly common. Yet, we know little about how this enriched language environment influences the connectivity of children's brains. Behavioural research in children and adults has shown that bilingualism experience may boost executive control (EC) skills, such as inhibitory control and attention. Moreover, increased structural and functional (resting-state) connectivity in language-related and EC-related brain networks is associated with increased executive control in bilingual adults. However, how bilingualism factors alter brain connectivity early in brain development remains poorly understood. We will combine standardised tests of attention with structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in bilingual children. This study will allow us to address an important field of inquiry within linguistics and developmental cognitive neuroscience by examining the following questions: Does bilingual experience modulate connectivity in language-related and EC-related networks in children? Do differences in resting-state brain connectivity correlate with differences in EC skills (specifically attention skills)? How do bilingualism-related factors, such as age of exposure to two languages, language usage and proficiency, modulate brain connectivity? We will collect structural and functional MRI, and quantitative measures of EC and language skills from two groups of English-Greek bilingual children - 20 simultaneous bilinguals (exposure to both languages from birth) and 20 successive bilinguals (exposure to English between the ages of 3 and 5 years) - and 20 English monolingual children, 8-10 years old. We will compare connectivity measures and attention skills between monolinguals and bilinguals to examine the effects of bilingual exposure. We will also examine to what extent bilingualism factors predict brain connectivity in EC and language networks. Overall, we hypothesize that connectivity and EC will be enhanced in bilingual children compared to monolingual children, and each outcome will be modulated by age of exposure to two languages and by bilingual language usage.","Goksan, Sezgi; Argyri, Froso; Clayden, Jonathan D; Liegeois, Frederique; Wei, Li",F1000Res,,282

Sentiment analysis and topic modeling analysis were performed using Twitter data from three phases during the initial European lockdown, and results were compared over time and between countries. Findings show that, in line with existing theory, assertive crisis responses and proactive communication were generally well-received, whereas tentative crisis responses or indications by the authorities that the crisis was manageable were generally met with suspicion. In addition, while government support was high in all countries during the height of the crisis, messages critical of the government as well as conspiracy theories were nevertheless widely circulated. Importantly, countries with the least assertive strategies, rather than clear negative responses, saw heightened polarization of sentiment in the population. Furthermore, in the case of Sweden, a laissez-faire strategy was generally accepted by the population, despite strong criticism from other countries, until mortality rates started to rise. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed with an emphasis of prior trust as a potential explanatory factor. Future research should seek to replicate these findings in other countries with different levels of prior governmental trust or with a different severity of the COVID-19 outbreak than the countries in this study as well as triangulate the findings of this study using alternative methods.","Perlstein, Sara Grøn; Verboord, Marc",PLoS One,,282
210307,Cross-Cultural Adaptation and Reliability of the Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI) to the Spanish Adolescent Population,2021,"BACKGROUND: The number of cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan have risen since the first case was reported on January 24, 2020, and 6225 infections have been reported as of June 30, 2020. On April 8, 2020, our hospital began screening patients via pre-admission reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and chest computed tomography (CT). Although no patients exhibited apparent pneumonia, treatment delay or changes in treatment plans were required for a few patients based on the results of screening tests. During an emerging infectious disease pandemic, the likelihood of being infected, as well as the disease itself, affects clinical decision making in several ways. We summarized and presented our experience. CASE PRESENTATION: After the introduction of pre-admission screening, RT-PCR and CT were performed in 200 and 76 patients, respectively, as of June 30, 2020. The treatment of five patients, including two patients with cervical cancer, two patients with ovarian tumors, and one patient with ovarian cancer, was affected by the results. Two asymptomatic RT-PCR-positive patients did not develop COVID-19, but their treatment was delayed until the confirmation of negative results. The other three patients were RT-PCR-negative, but abnormal CT findings suggested the possibility of COVID-19, which delayed treatment. The patients receiving first-line preoperative chemotherapy for ovarian cancer had clinically evident exacerbations because of the treatment delay. CONCLUSION: During the epidemic phase of an emerging infectious disease, we found that COVID-19 has several other effects besides its incidence. The postponing treatment was the most common, therefore, treatment of ovarian tumors and ovarian cancer was considered to be the most likely to be affected among gynecological diseases. Protocols that allow for easy over-diagnosis can be disadvantageous, mainly because of treatment delays, and therefore, the protocols must be developed in light of the local infection situation.","Nogami, Yuya; Kobayashi, Yusuke; Tsuji, Kosuke; Yokota, Megumi; Nishio, Hiroshi; Nakamura, Masaru; Yamagami, Wataru; Morisada, Tohru; Tominaga, Eiichiro; Banno, Kouji; Aoki, Daisuke",J Ovarian Res,,282

Thus, phytocompounds with broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory activity that target multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins will enhance the development of effective drugs against the disease. In this study, an in-house library of 117 steroidal plant-derived pregnanes (PDPs) was docked in the active regions of human glucocorticoid receptors (hGRs) in a comparative molecular docking analysis. Based on the minimal binding energy and a comparative dexamethasone binding mode analysis, a list of top twenty ranked PDPs docked in the agonist conformation of hGR, with binding energies ranging between -9.8 and -11.2 kcal/mol, was obtained and analyzed for possible interactions with the human Janus kinases 1 and Interleukins-6 and SARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, Papain-like protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. For each target protein, the top three ranked PDPs were selected. Eight PDPs (bregenin, hirundigenin, anhydroholantogenin, atratogenin A, atratogenin B, glaucogenin A, glaucogenin C and glaucogenin D) with high binding tendencies to the catalytic residues of multiple targets were identified. A high degree of structural stability was observed from the 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation analyses of glaucogenin C and hirundigenin complexes of hGR. The selected top-eight ranked PDPs demonstrated high druggable potentials and favourable in silico ADMET properties. Thus, the therapeutic potentials of glaucogenin C and hirundigenin can be explored for further in vitro and in vivo studies.","Gyebi, Gideon A; Ogunyemi, Oludare M; Ibrahim, Ibrahim M; Afolabi, Saheed O; Adebayo, Joseph O",Comput Biol Med,,282

223231,The Childhood Cancer Centre Is Coming Home: Experiences of Hospital-Based Home Care,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread rapidly over the world. Little is known about the outcomes of infections in pregnant women. The management and characteristics of preterm infants born to COVID-19 mothers need to be clarified. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, we describe the clinical courses of 6 preterm infants born to COVID-19 mothers, the management protocol, and related outcomes. RESULTS: Six preterm infants were admitted to Tongji Hospital between January 23 and March 19, 2020. Gestational age ranged from 28+5 to 36+3 weeks. One late preterm infant was delivered early due to maternal dyspnea from COVID-19. Five infants were delivered by Caesarean section. None had perinatal asphyxia. Two infants required respiratory support due to respiratory distress syndrome and apnea of prematurity. All infants did not develop severe complications of prematurity and are negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing. CONCLUSION: With an expedited and adequate delivery protocol, less invasive treatment principle, and active infection precautious, we found a limited impact of COVID-19 mothers on preterm delivery and neonatal short-term outcomes. The risk of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is low in preterm infants born to COVID-19 mothers if appropriate management is implemented.","Hu, Xiaolin; Gao, Jinzhi; Wei, Ying; Chen, Hui; Sun, Xuan; Chen, Juan; Luo, Xiaoping; Chen, Ling",Neonatology,,282
223410,A Systems Approach to Assess Transport and Diffusion of Hazardous Airborne Particles in a Large Surgical Suite: Potential Impacts on Viral Airborne Transmission,2020,"Vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and possible induction of pregnancy complications, including miscarriage, fetal malformations, fetal growth restriction and/or stillbirth, are serious concerns for pregnant individuals with COVID-19. According to clinical information, the incidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is limited to date. However, even if a neonate tests negative for SARS-CoV-2, frequent abnormal findings, including fetal and maternal vascular malperfusion, have been reported in cases of COVID-19-positive mothers. Primary receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It is highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells, such as syncytiotrophoblasts, cytotrophoblasts, endothelial cells, and the vascular smooth muscle cells of primary and secondary villi. However other route of transplacental infection cannot be ruled out. Pathological examinations have demonstrated that syncytiotrophoblasts are often infected with SARS-CoV-2, but fetuses are not always infected. These findings suggest the presence of a placental barrier, even if it is not completely effective. As the frequency and molecular mechanisms of intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have not been determined to date, intensive clinical examinations by repeated ultrasound and fetal heart rate monitoring are strongly recommended for pregnant women infected with COVID-19. In addition, careful investigation of placental samples after delivery by both morphological and molecular methods is also strongly recommended.","Komine-Aizawa, Shihoko; Takada, Kazuhide; Hayakawa, Satoshi",Placenta,,282

OBJECTIVES: to propose an analysis strategy to ascertain the non-random nature of the spatial spread of COVID-19 cases infection and identify any territorial aggregations, in order to enhance contact tracing activities in specific areas of the Lazio Region (Central Italy) and a large urban area as Rome. METHODS: all cases of COVID-19 of the Lazio Region notified to the Regional Service for Epidemiology, Surveillance, and Control of Infectious Diseases (Seresmi) with daily updates from the beginning of the epidemic to April 27, 2020 were considered. The analyses were carried out considering two periods (the first from the beginning of the epidemic to April 6 and the second from the beginning of the epidemic to April 27) and two different levels of spatial aggregation: the entire Lazio region excluding the Municipality of Rome, where the 377 municipalities represent the area units, and the Municipality of Rome, where the area units under study are the 155 urban areas (ZUR). The Scan statistic of Kulldorff was used to ascertain the non-random nature of the spatial spread of infected cases and to identify any territorial aggregations of cases of COVID-19 infection, using a retrospective spatial analysis in two overlapping periods. RESULTS: analysis was conducted at regional level in the two survey periods and revealed the presence of 7 localized clusters. In the Municipality of Rome, a single cluster (Historic Centre) was identified in the first period which includes 7 urban areas, while in the second period two distinct clusters (Omo and Farnesina) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Scan statistics are an important surveillance tool for monitoring disease outbreaks during the active phase of the epidemic and a useful contribution to epidemiological surveillance during the COVID-19 epidemic in a specific territory.","Badaloni, Chiara; Asta, Federica; Michelozzi, Paola; Mataloni, Francesca; Di Rosa, Enrico; Scognamiglio, Paola; Vairo, Francesco; Davoli, Marina; Leone, Michela",Epidemiol Prev,,282

The aggressive behavior of this group of tumors justifies the need for a multidisciplinary team to assist in clinical decisions during the current pandemic. Brazil is now ranked #2 in the number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 pandemic, and existing disparities in the treatment of neuro-oncology patients in Brazil will challenge the clinical and surgical decisions of this population, possibly affecting global survival. Objective: To search the literature about the management of glioblastomas during COVID-19 pandemic to guide surgical and clinical decisions in this population of patients in Brazil. Methods: We performed a systematic search on the PubMed electronic database targeting consensus statements concerning glioblastoma approaches during COVID-19 pandemic up to July 18, 2020. Results: When approaching glioblastoma during the COVID-19 pandemic, important parameters that help in the decision-making process are age, performance status, tumor molecular profile, and patient consent. Younger patients should follow the standard protocol after maximal safe resection, mainly those with MGMT methylated tumors. Aged and underperforming patients should be carefully evaluated, and probably a monotherapy scheme is to be considered. Centers are advised to engage in telemedicine and to elaborate means to reduce local infection. Conclusion: Approaching glioblastoma during the COVID-19 pandemic will be challenging worldwide, but particularly in Brazil, where a significant inequality of healthcare exists.","Batistella, Gabriel Novaes de Rezende; Santos, Adrialdo José; Paiva Neto, Manoel Antonio de; Ferrigno, Robson; Camargo, Veridiana Pires de; Stavale, João Norberto; Maldaun, Marcos Vinicius Calfat",Arq. neuropsiquiatr,,282

METHODS: A total of 183 patients with myopia (183 eyes) aged 8 to 18 years were enrolled in this study. The axial length (AL) of the eyes was measured by an IOL-Master, and corneal curvatures (K-values) and HOAs were measured by a Pentacam anterior segment diagnostic analyzer. RESULTS: Results of this study showed that the anterior, posterior and total corneal horizontal coma Z31 were - 0.1249 ± 0.105 µm, 0.0009 ± 0.001 µm, and - 0.1331 ± 0.116 µm, respectively; the anterior, posterior and total corneal vertical coma Z3- 1 were - 0.0212 ± 0.164 µm, 0.0003 ± 0.043 µm, and - 0.0216 ± 0.168 µm, respectively; and spherical aberration (SA) Z40 values were 0.2244 ± 0.091 µm, 0.1437 ± 0.029 um, and 0.1889 ± 0.090 µm, respectively. Total corneal Z31 was statistically correlated with posterior corneal astigmatism (K2b - K1b) (p = 0.038). Total corneal Z3- 1 was correlated with anterior corneal astigmatism (K2f - K1f) (p = 0.027). Anterior, posterior, and total corneal Z40 were correlated with anterior and posterior corneal curvature (K1f, K2f, K1b, K2b) (p = 0.001). Posterior corneal Z40b was also significantly correlated with AL. CONCLUSIONS: In adolescents with mild to moderate myopia, the posterior corneal surface shape may play a compensatory role in the balance of corneal aberrations, and the posterior corneal SA tended to become less negative as the AL increased.

241980,"The Condition of Air Pollution in Kraków, Poland, in 2005-2020, with Health Risk Assessment",2020,"BACKGROUND: The mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantining on children and young people (CYP) living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has yet to be fully comprehended. CYP in LMICs are at utmost risk, given the COVID-19-related restrictions and social distancing measures, resulting in reduced access to school-based services for nutritional and mental health needs. This study examined mental health of CYP during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Zambia and Sierra Leone. METHOD: A total of 468 disabled and disadvantaged CYP aged 12 to 25 completed a planning tool that comprised the short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS), as well as open-ended questions covering social connectedness, physical distancing and educational challenges during the lockdown. The community coaches screened individuals and families who could be eligible to receive emergency aid, and based on a convenience sample following distribution of aid, recipients were invited to complete the planning tool. RESULTS: The data showed that participants in the global south have increasing anxieties and fears centred on accessing offline educational resources and income loss in the family effecting food security and their ability to return to education. Mean (SD) SWEMWBS scores for all participants in Zambia and Sierra Leone, were 19.61 (3.45) and 21.65 (2.84), respectively. Mental well-being scores were lower in females, children aged 12-14 and participants with two or more disabilities. Factors significantly associated with poor mental wellbeing in the sample were: type of disability, nationality, peer relationships, connection to others during the pandemic, knowledge about COVID-19, worry about the long-term impact of COVID-19, and the types of self-isolating. CONCLUSION: The study shows that participants who self-reported low levels of COVID-19 health literacy also scored low on the mental wellbeing self-assessment. Yet, despite undoubted limited resources, these CYP are doing well in identifying their needs and maintaining hope in the face of the problems associated with COVID-19 in countries where stigma persists around mental ill-health.","Sharpe, Darren; Rajabi, Mohsen; Chileshe, Clement; Joseph, Sitali Mayamba; Sesay, Ibrahim; Williams, James; Sait, Siraj",BMC Psychol,,282

244869,Environmental Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Virus RNA in Health Facilities in Brazil and a Systematic Review on Contamination Sources,2021,"BACKGROUND: Weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure, some children develop a severe, life-threatening illness called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in MIS-C patients and severe hyperinflammatory response ensues with potential for cardiac complications. The cause of MIS-C has not previously been identified. METHODS: Here, we analyzed biospecimens from 100 children: 19 children with MIS-C, 26 with acute COVID-19, and 55 controls. Stool was assessed for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and plasma was assessed for markers of breakdown of mucosal barrier integrity, including zonulin. Ultrasensitive antigen detection was used to probe for SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia in plasma, and immune responses were characterized. As proof of concept, we treated a MIS-C patient with larazotide, a zonulin antagonist, and monitored impact on antigenemia and clinical response. RESULTS: We showed that in MIS-C, prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the GI tract leads to release of zonulin, a biomarker of intestinal permeability, with subsequent trafficking of SARS-CoV-2 antigens into the bloodstream, leading to hyperinflammation. The MIS-C patient treated with larazotide displayed a coinciding decrease in plasma SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen levels, inflammatory markers, and a resultant clinical improvement above that achieved with currently available treatments. CONCLUSION: These mechanistic data of MIS-C pathogenesis provide insight into targets for diagnosing, treating, and preventing MIS-C, which are urgently needed for this increasingly common severe COVID-19-related disease in children.","Yonker, Lael M; Gilboa, Tal; Ogata, Alana F; Senussi, Yasmeen; Lazarovits, Roey; Boribong, Brittany P; Bartsch, Yannic C; Loiselle, Maggie; Noval Rivas, Magali; Porritt, Rebecca A; Lima, Rosiane; Davis, Jameson P; Farkas, Eva J; Burns, Madeleine D; Young, Nicola; Mahajan, Vinay S; Hajizadeh, Soroush; Herrera Lopez, Xcanda I; Kreuzer, Johannes; Morris, Robert; Martinez, Enid E; Han, Isaac; Griswold, Kettner; Barry, Nicholas C; Thompson, David B; Church, George; Edlow, Andrea G; Haas, Wilhelm; Pillai, Shiv; Arditi, Moshe; Alter, Galit; Walt, David R; Fasano, Alessio",J. clin. invest,,282

252684,Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Change in Skeletal Muscle Mass in Older Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: A Retrospective Cohort Study,2021,"Shaped by human movement, place connectivity is quantified by the strength of spatial interactions among locations. For decades, spatial scientists have researched place connectivity, applications, and metrics. The growing popularity of social media provides a new data stream where spatial social interaction measures are largely devoid of privacy issues, easily assessable, and harmonized. In this study, we introduced a global multi-scale place connectivity index (PCI) based on spatial interactions among places revealed by geotagged tweets as a spatiotemporal-continuous and easy-to-implement measurement. The multi-scale PCI, demonstrated at the US county level, exhibits a strong positive association with SafeGraph population movement records (10 percent penetration in the US population) and Facebook's social connectedness index (SCI), a popular connectivity index based on social networks. We found that PCI has a strong boundary effect and that it generally follows the distance decay, although this force is weaker in more urbanized counties with a denser population. Our investigation further suggests that PCI has great potential in addressing real-world problems that require place connectivity knowledge, exemplified with two applications: 1) modeling the spatial spread of COVID-19 during the early stage of the pandemic and 2) modeling hurricane evacuation destination choice. The methodological and contextual knowledge of PCI, together with the launched visualization platform and open-sourced PCI datasets at various geographic levels, are expected to support research fields requiring knowledge in human spatial interactions.","Li, Zhenlong; Huang, Xiao; Ye, Xinyue; Jiang, Yuqin; Yago, Martin; Ning, Huan; Hodgson, Michael E.; Li, Xiaoming",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03991v3.pdf,282

We found in situ simulation to be a valuable tool in disease outbreak preparedness, allowing us to ensure proper use of personal protective equipment and protocol adherence, and to identify latent safety threats and novel problems that were not apparent in the initial planning stage. Through this, we could refine our workflow and operating room setup to provide timely surgical interventions for potential COVID-19 patients in our hospital while keeping our staff and patients safe. Running a simulation may be time and resource intensive, but it is a small price to pay if it can help prevent disease spread in an outbreak.","Lie, Sui An; Wong, Loong Tat; Chee, Marianne; Chong, Shin Yuet",Simul Healthc,,282

257475,Comparison of Physical Activity Levels in Youths before and during a Pandemic Lockdown,2021,"TER94 is a multifunctional AAA+ ATPase crucial for diverse cellular processes, especially protein quality control and chromatin dynamics in eukaryotic organisms. Many viruses, including coronavirus, herpesvirus, and retrovirus, coopt host cellular TER94 for optimal viral invasion and replication. Previous proteomics analysis identified the association of TER94 with the budded virions (BVs) of baculovirus, an enveloped insect large DNA virus. Here, the role of TER94 in the prototypic baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) life cycle was investigated. In virus-infected cells, TER94 accumulated in virogenic stroma (VS) at the early stage of infection and subsequently partially rearranged in the ring zone region. In the virions, TER94 was associated with the nucleocapsids of both BV and occlusion-derived virus (ODV). Inhibition of TER94 ATPase activity significantly reduced viral DNA replication and BV production. Electron/immunoelectron microscopy revealed that inhibition of TER94 resulted in the trapping of nucleocapsids within cytoplasmic vacuoles at the nuclear periphery for BV formation and blockage of ODV envelopment at a premature stage within infected nuclei, which appeared highly consistent with its pivotal function in membrane biogenesis. Further analyses showed that TER94 was recruited to the VS or subnuclear structures through interaction with viral early proteins LEF3 and helicase, whereas inhibition of TER94 activity blocked the proper localization of replication-related viral proteins and morphogenesis of VS, providing an explanation for its role in viral DNA replication. Taken together, these data indicated the crucial functions of TER94 at multiple steps of the baculovirus life cycle, including genome replication, BV formation, and ODV morphogenesis.IMPORTANCE TER94 constitutes an important AAA+ ATPase that associates with diverse cellular processes, including protein quality control, membrane fusion of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum network, nuclear envelope reformation, and DNA replication. To date, little is known regarding the role(s) of TER94 in the baculovirus life cycle. In this study, TER94 was found to play a crucial role in multiple steps of baculovirus infection, including viral DNA replication and BV and ODV formation. Further evidence showed that the membrane fission/fusion function of TER94 is likely to be exploited by baculovirus for virion morphogenesis. Moreover, TER94 could interact with the viral early proteins LEF3 and helicase to transport and further recruit viral replication-related proteins to establish viral replication factories. This study highlights the critical roles of TER94 as an energy-supplying chaperon in the baculovirus life cycle and enriches our knowledge regarding the biological function of this important host factor.","Li, Yimeng; Hu, Liangbo; Chen, Tong; Chang, Meng; Deng, Fei; Hu, Zhihong; Wang, Hualin; Wang, Manli",J. virol,,282

METHODS: We performed secondary data analysis using tract (N = 73,056) and county (N = 3142) level data from the US Census Bureau and other sources for the USA. Confirmed COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 population was our outcome measure. We performed mixed-effect negative binomial regression to examine the association of county population's percentage residing in concentrated disadvantage and Black-concentrated tracts with COVID-19 deaths while controlling for several other characteristics. RESULTS: For every 10% increase in the percentage of county population residing in concentrated disadvantage and Black-concentrated tracts, the rate for confirmed COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 population increases by a factor of 1.14 (mortality rate ratio [MMR] = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.11, 1.18) and 1.11 (MMR = 1.11; 95% CI:1.08, 1.14), respectively. These relations stayed significant in all models in further sensitivity analyses. Moreover, a joint increase in the percentage of county population residing in racial and socioeconomic segregation was associated with a much greater increase in COVID-19 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that people living in socioeconomically and racially segregated neighborhoods may be disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 deaths. Future multilevel and longitudinal studies with data at both individual and aggregated tract level can help isolate the potential impacts of the individual-level characteristics and neighborhood-level socioeconomic and racial segregation with more precision and confidence.","Khanijahani, Ahmad; Tomassoni, Larisa",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,282

This study aims to identify the key genes that cause cytokine storm in COVID-19 infected patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a difference analysis on the GSE147507 data set. The analysis results are combined with immune genes to obtain immune-related genes among the differential genes. Finally, GO enrichment analysis, PPI analysis, core gene identification, and ssGSEA enrichment analysis were performed on the new gene set. RESULTS: A total of 232 differential genes were screened out. After merging with immune genes, a total of 29 immune-related genes were obtained. Further analysis revealed that the genes were enriched in 16 pathways, and the protein interaction network had a total of 29 nodes and 139 edges. After screening, the core gene was CXCL10. The ssGSEA results of CXCL10 showed that CD4 and CD8 immune-related signature were significantly enriched in high CXCL10 expression, and the samples with low CXCL10 expression were significantly enriched with monocytes and DC immune-related signature. CONCLUSIONS: CXCL10 may be a key gene related to the cytokine storm of COVID-19 infection, and it is expected to become the therapeutic target.","Zhang, N; Zhao, Y-D; Wang, X-M",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,282

274405,Hedonic and Utilitarian Motivations of Home Motion-Sensing Game Play Behavior in China: An Empirical Study,2020,"Rationale: Lung disease related to Coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) may evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring admission in intensive care unit (ICU). As ARDS is due in this specific situation to a transient viral infection, we hypothesized that only a minority of survivors would elicit significant lung impairment.Methods: We included 32 who survived to COVID-related ARDS and provided consent. At three-months follow-up, modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) score, pulmonary function tests (PFT) (FEV1%, FVC%, TLC%, DLCO% and KCO%) and chest computed tomography (CT) scan were collected as well as baseline characteristics, APACHE II and SOFA scores.Results: Twenty-six patients (81.2%) were male. Median age was 59 years old (range: 46-75) with a median BMI 29kg/m2 (19,53-41,20), and median ICU stay was 24 days (2-110). Baseline characteristics showed: Hypertension (16), diabetes mellitus (5), cardiomyopathy (4), COPD (1), renal dysfunction (2), pulmonary malignancy (1) and smoking history (8). At admission, median APACHE II and SOFA scores were 14 (7-21) and 4 (2-12), respectively;and median PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 62 (45-122). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 24 patients for median of 35 days (5-103);whereas others received high flow oxygen or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, and 6 required additional extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. Hydroxychloroquine was administered to all patients, Remdesivir to 2, Azithromycine to 4, steroids to 8, and antibiotics to 14 for respiratory superinfection. At 3 months, 12 patients experienced no dyspnea, 11 had an mMRC score of 1, 5 of 2, 3 of 3 and 1 of 4. Median FEV1 was 94% [32-123], FVC 87% [29-158], TLC 86% [ 51-124], DLCO 71% [50-112]and KCO 86% [45-135] of normal values. Radiological findings revealed ground glass pattern (27), reticulation (12), bronchiectasis (13) and opacities (8). Twenty-one expiration CT-scan were obtained and showed air trapping in 15 suggesting bronchiolitis. Conclusion: a substantial proportion of patients suffering from ARDS related to COVID-19 display respiratory sequelae at 3 months, mainly consisting of reduced lung diffusion capacity, signs suggesting bronchiolitis and remaining ground glass opacities. Whether these features will remain in long-term needs to be determined.","Pasau, T.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,282

Caregivers of 1- to 5-year-old children completed an online survey between 30 March and 27 April 2020. Information about the child's movement behaviors before (retrospectively) and during the pandemic, as well as family characteristics were reported. In total, 3157 participants provided complete data (mean children age: 3.1 ± 1.38 years). During early stages of the pandemic, time spent in physical activity decreased, recreational screen time and sleep duration increased, and sleep quality declined. Toddlers and preschoolers with space to play at home and living in rural areas experienced an attenuated impact of the pandemic restrictions on their physical activity levels, screen time, and sleep quality. Older children, those whose caregivers were aged &#8805;35-<45 years and had a higher educational level, and those living in apartments had greater changes, mainly a decrease in total physical activity and increase in screen time.

280192,Impact of HVAC-Systems on the Dispersion of Infectious Aerosols in a Cardiac Intensive Care Unit,2020,"Rationale: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the major reasons for ventilation and intubation management of COVID-19 patients but there is no noninvasive imaging monitoring protocol for ARDS. In this study, we aimed to develop a noninvasive ARDS monitoring protocol based on traditional quantitative and radiomics approaches from chest CT. Methods: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 31, 2020 were enrolled in this study. Quantitative and radiomics data were extracted from automatically segmented regions of interest (ROIs) of infection regions in the lungs. ARDS existence was measured by Pa02/Fi02 <300 in artery blood samples. Three different models were constructed by using the traditional quantitative imaging metrics, radiomics features and their combinations, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the effectiveness of the models. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to test the clinical value of the proposed model. Results: The proposed models were constructed using 352 CT images from 86 patients. The median age was 49, and the male proportion was 61.9%. The training dataset and the validation dataset were generated by randomly sampling the patients with a 2:1 ratio. Chi-squared test showed that there was no significant difference in baseline of the enrolled patients between the training and validation datasets. The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of the traditional quantitative model, radiomics model and combined model in the validation dataset was 0.91, 0.91 and 0.94, respectively. Accordingly, the sensitivities were 0.55, 0.82 and 0.58, while the specificities were 0.97, 0.86 and 0.98. The DCA curve showed that when threshold probability for a doctor or patients is within a range of 0 to 0.83, the combined model adds more net benefit than ""treat all"" or ""treat none"" strategies, while the traditional quantitative model and radiomics model could add benefit in all threshold probability. Conclusions: It is feasible to monitor ARDS from CT images using radiomics or traditional quantitative analysis in COVID-19. The radiomics model seems to be the most practical one for possible clinical use. Multi-center validation with a larger number of samples is recommended in the future.","Chen, Yuntian; Wang, Yi; Zhang, Yuwei; Zhang, Na; Zhao, Shuang; Zeng, Hanjiang; Deng, Wen; Huang, Zixing; Liu, Sanyuan; Song, Bin",Int J Med Sci,,282
280217,A Preliminary Investigation on the Statistical Correlations between SARS-CoV-2 Spread and Local Meteorology,2020,"Growing reports since the beginning of the pandemic and till date describe increased rates of cardiac complications (CC) in the active phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). CC commonly observed include myocarditis/myocardial injury, arrhythmias and heart failure, with an incidence reaching about a quarter of hospitalized patients in some reports. The increased incidence of CC raise questions about the possible heightened susceptibility of patients with cardiac disease to develop severe COVID-19, and whether the virus itself is involved in the pathogenesis of CC. The wide array of CC seems to stem from multiple mechanisms, including the ability of the virus to directly enter cardiomyocytes, and to indirectly damage the heart through systemic hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states, endothelial injury of the coronary arteries and hypoxemia. The induced CC seem to dramatically impact the prognosis of COVID-19, with some studies suggesting over 50% mortality rates with myocardial damage, up from ~ 5% overall mortality of COVID-19 alone. Thus, it is particularly important to investigate the relation between COVID-19 and heart disease, given the major effect on morbidity and mortality, aiming at early detection and improving patient care and outcomes. In this article, we review the growing body of published data on the topic to provide the reader with a comprehensive and robust description of the available evidence and its implication for clinical practice.","Ramadan, Mohammad Said; Bertolino, Lorenzo; Marrazzo, Tommaso; Florio, Maria Teresa; Durante-Mangoni, Emanuele",Intern. emerg. med,,282

The crystal is stabilized by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds. Alternate layers of anions and cations/water molecules parallel to (010) can be distinguished. Computational studies of the network packing of the title compound by high-level DFT-D/B3LYP calculations indicate stabilization of the networks with conventional and non-conventional intermolecular O-H...O, N-H...O and C-H...O hydrogen bonds along with &#960;-stacking contacts. Due to the presence of water molecules and the importance of forming hydrogen bonds with the involvement of water clusters to the stability of the crystal packing, the importance and role of these water clusters, and the quantitative stability resulting from the formation of hydrogen bonds and possibly other noncovalent bonds such as &#960;-stacking are examined. The binding energies obtained by DFT-D calculations for these contacts indicate that hydrogen bonds, especially O-H...O and N-H...O, control the construction of the crystalline packing. Additionally, the results of Bader's theory of AIM for these interactions agree reasonably well with the calculated energies.","Chahkandi, Mohammad; Keivanloo Shahrestanaki, Abolfazl; Mirzaei, Masoud; Nawaz Tahir, Muhammad; Mague, Joel T",Acta Crystallogr B Struct Sci Cryst Eng Mater,,282

In China, variant PEDV causes severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in piglets, leading to very high morbidity and mortality. However, the pathogenesis of PEDV is still not fully understood. In our study, we analyzed the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA expression profiles of PEDV GDgh16 in infected Vero cells at 60 h postinfection. A total of 61,790 annotated mRNAs, 14,247 annotated lncRNAs and 1290 novel lncRNAs were identified. A total of 227 annotated lncRNAs and 13 novel lncRNAs were significantly and differentially expressed after viral infection. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) databases were used to identify genes adjacent to the lncRNAs, and it was found that these lncRNAs were enriched in pathways related to immune and antiviral responses. Next, we selected candidate lncRNAs and their predicted target genes for study. RT-qPCR demonstrated that these lncRNAs and genes were differentially expressed after PEDV infection. Our study investigated the function of lncRNAs involved in PEDV infection, providing new insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of PEDV.","Yu, Linyang; Dong, Jianguo; Liu, Yanling; Zhang, Leyi; Liang, Pengshuai; Wang, Lei; Huang, Li; Xu, Zheng; Song, Changxu",Arch Virol,,282

This drew attention to the discussion of how different health systems and different levels of health spending are effective in combating Covid-19. In this study, the role of the health system in the fight against Covid-19 is discussed. In this context, the number of hospital beds, the number of doctors, life expectancy at 60, universal health service and the share of health expenditures in GDP were used as health indicators. In the study, firstly 2020 data was estimated by using the Artificial Neural Networks simulation method and this year was used in the analysis. The model, with the data of 124 countries, was estimated using the cross-sectional OLS regression method. The estimation results show that the number of hospital beds, number of doctors and life expectancy at the age of 60 have statistically significant and positive effects on the ratio of Covid-19 recovered/cases. Universal health service and share of health expenditures in GDP are not significant statistically on the cases and recovered.

We conducted a retrospective, multicenter study, and followed-up with all children from the families with SARS-CoV-2 infected members in Zhejiang Province, China. All infections were confirmed by testing the SARS-CoV-2 RNA with real-time reverse transcription PCR method, and epidemiological data between children and adults in the same families were compared. Effect of antiviral therapy was evaluated observationally and fecal-viral excretion times among groups with different antiviral regiments were compared with Kaplan-Meier plot. By 29 February 2020, 1298 cases from 883 families were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 314 of which were families with children. Incidence of infection in child close contacts was significantly lower than that in adult contacts (13.2% vs 21.2%). The mean age of 43 pediatric cases was 8.2 years and mean incubation period was 9.1 days. Forty (93.0%) were family clustering. Thirty-three children had coronavirus disease 2019 (20 pneumonia) with mild symptoms and 10 were asymptomatic. Fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was positive in 91.4% (32/35) cases and some children had viral excretion time over 70 days. Viral clearance time was not different among the groups treated with different antiviral regiments. No subsequent infection was observed in family contacts of fecal-viral-excreting children. Children have lower susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection, longer incubation, and fecal-viral excretion time.

An overview will be given on liver injury, liver transplant and the possible consequences of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing liver diseases.","Napodano, Cecilia; Pocino, Krizia; Stefanile, Annunziata; Marino, Mariapaola; Miele, Luca; Gulli, Francesca; Basile, Valerio; Pandolfi, Franco; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Rapaccini, Gian Ludovico; Basile, Umberto",Scand J Immunol,,282
293760,An Eventual Sars-CoV-2 Infection Prevention Protocol in the Medical Setting and Dental Office,2021,"The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for the infectious disease caused by coronavirus 19 (COVID-19). The current pandemic is growing worldwide and could affect 50-60% of the world population in the months to come. The most severe disease manifestations are atypical pneumonia and sepsis, but the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the liver, has recently been reported to be affected by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to review the literature available on the topic and provide information about COVID-19, in both healthy and diseased livers, and issue recommendations. The incidence of liver injury specifically associated with COVID-19 varies from 14.8-53%. The majority of case series have reported altered ALT and AST, elevated total bilirubin, and low serum albumin and liver compromise has been associated with the most severe cases of COVID-19. Cirrhosis of the liver has a recognized immune dysfunction status that includes immunodeficiency and systemic inflammation, making it reasonable for those patients to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The recommendations for those patients, in addition to the general measures of physical distancing and handwashing for all persons, include social, medical, and psychologic support during the period of home quarantine to prevent lapses in treatment. Patients should be made aware that they need to keep abreast of changes in recommendations and social policies.","Velarde-Ruiz Velasco, J A; García-Jiménez, E S; Remes-Troche, J M",Rev. gastroenterol.

293993,Analysis of Gender-Dependent Personal Protective Behaviors in a National Sample: Polish Adolescents' COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study,2020,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: As the global impact of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been severe, many countries have intensified containment activities to eliminate virus transmission, through early detection and isolation strategies. To establish a proper quarantine strategy, it is essential to understand how easily the virus can spread in the communities. METHODS: In this study, we collected detailed information on the circumstances in which human-to-human transmission occurred in the tertiary transmission cases of COVID-19 in the community. RESULTS: On January 26, 2020, an imported case of COVID-19 was confirmed, and by February 10, 2020, one secondary transmission and three tertiary transmissions were identified. Secondary transmission occurred on the first day of illness of the infector, and his symptoms were suggestive of a common cold. The transmission occurred during a 90-minute long meal together in a restaurant. The people were sitting within one meter of each other, and had no direct contact. The tertiary transmission also occurred on the first-day illness of the other infector, and his only symptom was slight chills. The transmission occurred at a church during 2-hour-long worship, and two rows separated them. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that mildly symptomatic patients with COVID-19 could transmit the virus from the first day of illness through daily activities in the community. Early detection and isolation of patients with COVID-19 may be challenging.","Kim, Nam Joong; Choe, Pyoeng Gyun; Park, Sang-Joon; Lim, Jaegyun; Lee, Wang Jun; Kang, Chang Kyung; Park, Wan Beom; Seong, Moon-Woo; Oh, Myoung-Don",Korean J Intern Med,,282

295796,Exploration of the Evaluation and Optimization of Community Epidemic Prevention in Wuhan Based on a DEA Model,2020,"Complex modeling has received significant attention in recent years and is increasingly used to explain statistical phenomena with increasing and decreasing fluctuations, such as the similarity or difference of spike protein charge patterns of coronaviruses. Different from the existing covariance or correlation coefficient methods in traditional integer dimension construction, this study proposes a simplified novel fractional dimension derivation with the exact Excel tool algorithm. It involves the fractional center moment extension to covariance, which results in a complex covariance coefficient that is better than the Pearson correlation coefficient, in the sense that the nonlinearity relationship can be further depicted. The spike protein sequences of coronaviruses were obtained from the GenBank and GISAID databases, including the coronaviruses from pangolin, bat, canine, swine (three variants), feline, tiger, SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 (including the strains from Wuhan, Beijing, New York, German, and the UK variant B.1.1.7) which were used as the representative examples in this study. By examining the values above and below the average/mean based on the positive and negative charge patterns of the amino acid residues of the spike proteins from coronaviruses, the proposed algorithm provides deep insights into the nonlinear evolving trends of spike proteins for understanding the viral evolution and identifying the protein characteristics associated with viral fatality. The calculation results demonstrate that the complex covariance coefficient analyzed by this algorithm is capable of distinguishing the subtle nonlinear differences in the spike protein charge patterns with reference to Wuhan strain SARS-CoV-2, which the Pearson correlation coefficient may overlook. Our analysis reveals the unique convergent (positive correlative) to divergent (negative correlative) domain center positions of each virus. The convergent or conserved region may be critical to the viral stability or viability;while the divergent region is highly variable between coronaviruses, suggesting high frequency of mutations in this region. The analyses show that the conserved center region of SARS-CoV-1 spike protein is located at amino acid residues 900, but shifted to the amino acid residues 700 in MERS spike protein, and then to amino acid residues 600 in SARS-COV-2 spike protein, indicating the evolution of the coronaviruses. Interestingly, the conserved center region of the spike protein in SARS-COV-2 variant B.1.1.7 shifted back to amino acid residues 700, suggesting this variant is more virulent than the original SARS-COV-2 strain. Another important characteristic our study reveals is that the distance between the divergent mean and the maximal divergent point in each of the viruses (MERS &gt;SARS-CoV-1 &gt;SARS-CoV-2) is proportional to viral fatality rate. This algorithm may help to understand and analyze the evolving trends and critical characteristics of SARS-COV-2 variants, other coronaviral proteins and viruses.","Huang, Jun Steed Huang Jiamin Moran Zhang Wandong",Entropy,,282

There is a sparsity of evidence in respect of the efficacy of personal protective equipment (PPE) used during restraint for reducing risk of infection. METHODS: A series of choreographed restraint episodes were used to simulate contact contamination in research participants playing the roles of staff members and a patient. For comparison, one episode of simulated recording of physical observations was taken. Ultraviolet (UV) fluorescent material was used to track the simulated contact contamination, with analysis undertaken using established image registration techniques of UV photographs. This was repeated for three separate sets of PPE. RESULTS: All three PPE sets showed similar performance in protecting against contamination transfer. For teams not utilising coveralls, this was dependent upon effective cleansing as part of doffing. There were similar patterns of contamination for restraint team members assigned to specific roles, with hands and upper torso appearing to be higher-risk areas. The restraint-related contamination was 23 times higher than that observed for physical observations. DISCUSSION: A second layer of clothing that can be removed showed efficacy in reducing contact contamination. PPE fit to individual is important. Post-restraint cleansing procedures are currently inadequate, with new procedures for face and neck cleansing required. These findings leave scope for staff to potentially improve their appearance when donning PPE and engaging with distressed patients.","Dix, Roland; Straiton, David; Metherall, Peter; Laidlaw, James; McLean, Lisa; Hayward, Andy; Ginger, Gary; Forrester, Louise; O039,; Rourke, Paul; Jefferies, Rob",Med Sci Law,,282

Therefore, this study aim to evaluate the prevalence and clinical correlates of depressive symptoms in the general population quarantined during the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen. METHODS: 2237 quarantined general individuals participated in this cross-sectional study from February 14 to March 4, 2020, during their 14 days quarantine. They completed the Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) for depression, Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) for anxiety, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) for post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive symptom was 6.21% in quarantined individuals. The depressed group were younger, less married and educated, and had higher SAS, PSQI, IES-R total scores (all p<0.05), as well as more avoidance, intrusion and hyperarousal symptoms than the non-depressed group. Correlation analysis showed significant correlations between SDS score and the following parameters: age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total and its three subscale scores (Bonferroni corrected all p<0.05). Further multiple regression indicated that age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total score, Avoidance and Hyperarousal factor were independent predictors of depressive symptom. LIMITATIONS: This study adopted a cross-sectional design and used self-report questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an elevated prevalence of depressive symptom in quarantined general individuals in Shenzhen. Some demographic and clinical variables were associated with depressive symptoms.","Peng, Min; Mo, Beirong; Liu, Yansong; Xu, Mingming; Song, Xinran; Liu, Luyu; Fang, Yeqing; Guo, Tianyou; Ye, Jinying; Yu, Zhijian; Deng, Qiwen; Zhang, Xiangyang",J Affect Disord,,282
299526,"Response to the Comment on ""A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Hospitalised Current Smokers and COVID-19""",2020,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening complication arising from venous thromboembolism with a difficult diagnosis and treatment and is often associated with increased mortality and morbidity. PE had a significantly low incidence prior to the COVID-19 epidemic. This condition saw a sharp surge during the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating an evident viral influence on PE's pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients. The hypercoagulable state induced by the viral load seems to be the major contributor, and the classical causative factors seem to play a lesser role. PE in COVID-19 infection has become a mammoth challenge since the diagnosis is quite challenging due to overlapping symptoms, lack of prior-known predisposing risk factors, limited resources, and viral transmittance risk. Numerous factors arising out of the viral load or treatment lead to an increased risk for PE in COVID-19 patients, besides the fact that certain unknown risk factors may also contribute to the incidence of PE in COVID-19 patients. The management of PE in COVID-19 infection mainly comprises thromboprophylaxis and anticoagulant therapy with mechanical ventilation, depending on the risk stratification of the patient, with a post-COVID-19 management that prevents recurrent PE and complications. This review aims to discuss various aspects of COVID-19-infection-associated PE and major differential aspects from non-COVID-19 PE.","Akhter, Mohammad Suhail; Hamali, Hassan A; Mobarki, Abdullah A; Rashid, Hina; Oldenburg, Johannes; Biswas, Arijit",,,282

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Initial chest CT of 1064 patients with respiratory symptoms suspect of COVID-19 referred between March 18th, and May 12th 2020, were read according to a standardized procedure. The results of chest CTs were compared to the results of the RT-PCR. RESULTS: 546 (51%) patients were found to be positive for SARS-CoV2 at RT-PCR. The highest rate of positive RT-PCR was during the second week of confinement reaching 71.9%. After six weeks of confinement, the positive RT-PCR rate dropped significantly to 10.5% (p<0.001) and even 2.2% during the two last weeks. Overall, CT revealed patterns suggestive of COVID-19 in 603 patients (57%), whereas an alternative diagnosis was found in 246 patients (23%). CT was considered normal in 215 patients (20%) and inconclusive in 1 patient. The overall sensitivity of CT was 88%, specificity 76%, PPV 79%, and NPV 85%. At week-2, the same figures were 89%, 69%, 88% and 71% respectively and 60%, 84%, 30% and 95% respectively at week-6. At the end of confinement when the rate of positive PCR became extremely low the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of CT were 50%, 82%, 6% and 99% respectively. CONCLUSION: At the peak of the epidemic, chest CT had sufficiently high sensitivity and PPV to serve as a first-line positive diagnostic tool but at the end of the epidemic wave CT is more useful to exclude COVID-19 pneumonia.","Boussouar, Samia; Wagner, Mathilde; Donciu, Victoria; Pasi, Nicoletta; Salem, Joe Elie; Renard-Penna, Raphaele; Marot, Stéphane; Freund, Yonathan; Redheuil, Alban; Lucidarme, Olivier",PLoS One,,282

Interventions are focused on developmental or behavioral approaches and are mostly individual or group ones. In the present study, both proposed approaches in the form of structured individual and group parent training sessions among Iranian families are investigated. METHOD: This study was a randomized clinical trial which was performed in 2019-2020 in Tehran. Forty four 3-5 year-old children with autism participated in the study and were assigned to experimental (nâ¯=â¯22) and control (nâ¯=â¯22) groups through block randomization method. To evaluate the effectiveness of therapy on autism symptoms, Gilliam Autism Rating and Functional Emotional Assessment Scales were used. Also, Parenting Stress Index and Quality of Life Questionnaire were implemented to investigate the secondary effects of the therapy. After 12 therapy sessions, both groups took the posttest and 3 months later, follow up evaluations were performed. RESULTS: The treatment group manifested significant improvement regarding autism symptoms in both the posttest and follow up (Å2â¯=â¯.77, Pâ¯<â¯.05) as well as Functional Emotional Development (Å2â¯=â¯.62, Pâ¯<â¯.05). Comparing the means indicates that the experimental group mean score is significantly higher in quality of life and lower in parenting stress than the control group's. CONCLUSION: Parent training is effective on autism symptoms and functional emotional development. Regarding the fact that the follow-up phase coincided with Covid-19 pandemic and quarantine, it can be concluded that the therapy has been successful in maintaining the attained capabilities.","Akhani, Afsaneh; Dehghani, Mahmood; Gharraee, Banafsheh; Hakim Shooshtari, Mitra",Asian J Psychiatr,,282

METHOD AND MATERIALS: Nine periodontally healthy nonsmoking patients (seven women, 37.5 ± 7.36 years old) with a total of 41 adjacent RT I (n = 23) and RT II (n = 18) gingival recessions exhibiting a minimum depth of 2 mm were treated by means of MCAT+PADM. Recession depth and width, width of attached and keratinized tissue, probing depths, and clinical attachment level were measured at baseline and at 1 and 4 years postsurgically. The primary outcome variable was complete root coverage (ie 100% root coverage), while secondary outcomes were mean root coverage and increase in keratinized tissue and attached gingiva widths. RESULTS: At 1 and 4 years, statistically highly significant (P < .001) root coverage was obtained in all nine patients compared to baseline. Mean root coverage decreased in these nine patients from 72.05 ± 30.18% at 1 year to 56.79 ± 27.53% at 4 years. Complete root coverage was obtained in 18 gingival recessions at 1 year (baseline RT: 12 RT I, 6 RT II) and in seven gingival recessions (5 RT I, 2 RT II) at 4 years. Most root coverage occurred in the first year postsurgically, showing a statistically significant decrease between the first and fourth year (P = .003). Mean width of attached gingiva increased statistically significantly (P < .05) from 2.85 ± 1.08 mm to 3.14 ± 1.08 mm at 1 year with a statistically significant decrease at 4 years. At 1 year, 78.05% of gingival recessions showed a root coverage > 50%, and 68.29% still exhibited a root coverage > 50% at 4 years. CONCLUSION: The use of MCAT+PADM represents a valuable treatment option for multiple adjacent maxillary and mandibular RT I and II gingival recessions on a long-term basis.","Cosgarea, Raluca; Miron, Rick; Bora, Raluca; Rosu, Alexandra; Buduru, Smaranda; Sculean, Anton",Quintessence Int,,282
314721,"Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Indoor Dust Collected during the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown in Saudi Arabia: Status, Sources and Human Health Risks",2021,"BACKGROUND: Scarce data are available on what variables affect the risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the development of symptomatic COVID-19, and, particularly, the relationship with viral load. We aimed to analyse data from linked index cases of COVID-19 and their contacts to explore factors associated with transmission of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this cohort study, patients were recruited as part of a randomised controlled trial done between March 17 and April 28, 2020, that aimed to assess if hydroxychloroquine reduced transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Patients with COVID-19 and their contacts were identified by use of the electronic registry of the Epidemiological Surveillance Emergency Service of Catalonia (Spain). Patients with COVID-19 included in our analysis were aged 18 years or older, not hospitalised, had quantitative PCR results available at baseline, had mild symptom onset within 5 days before enrolment, and had no reported symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections in their accommodation or workplace within the 14 days before enrolment. Contacts included were adults with a recent history of exposure and absence of COVID-19-like symptoms within the 7 days preceding enrolment. Viral load of contacts, measured by quantitative PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab, was assessed at enrolment, at day 14, and whenever the participant reported COVID-19-like symptoms. We assessed risk of transmission and developing symptomatic disease and incubation dynamics using regression analysis. We assessed the relationship of viral load and characteristics of cases (age, sex, number of days from reported symptom onset, and presence or absence of fever, cough, dyspnoea, rhinitis, and anosmia) and associations between risk of transmission and characteristics of the index case and contacts. FINDINGS: We identified 314 patients with COVID-19, with 282 (90%) having at least one contact (753 contacts in total), resulting in 282 clusters. 90 (32%) of 282 clusters had at least one transmission event. The secondary attack rate was 17% (125 of 753 contacts), with a variation from 12% when the index case had a viral load lower than 1â×â106 copies per mL to 24% when the index case had a viral load of 1â×â1010 copies per mL or higher (adjusted odds ratio per log10 increase in viral load 1·3, 95% CI 1·1-1·5). Increased risk of transmission was also associated with household contact (3·0, 1·59-5·65) and age of the contact (per year: 1·02, 1·01-1·04). 449 contacts had a positive PCR result at baseline. 28 (6%) of 449 contacts had symptoms at the first visit. Of 421 contacts who were asymptomatic at the first visit, 181 (43%) developed symptomatic COVID-19, with a variation from approximately 38% in contacts with an initial viral load lower than 1â×â107 copies per mL to greater than 66% for those with an initial viral load of 1â×â1010 copies per mL or higher (hazard ratio per log10 increase in viral load 1·12, 95% CI 1·05-1·20; p=0·0006). Time to onset of symptomatic disease decreased from a median of 7 days (IQR 5-10) for individuals with an initial viral load lower than 1â×â107 copies per mL to 6 days (4-8) for those with an initial viral load between 1â×â107 and 1â×â109 copies per mL, and 5 days (3-8) for those with an initial viral load higher than 1â×â109 copies per mL. INTERPRETATION: In our study, the viral load of index cases was a leading driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The risk of symptomatic COVID-19 was strongly associated with the viral load of contacts at baseline and shortened the incubation time of COVID-19 in a dose-dependent manner.

Since COVID-19 disease was declared by the WHO there has been a redistribution of the healthcare system for these types of patients, especially in the front line, which is, in primary care, emergencies and in intensive care units (ICU). In primary care, the fundamental role is the diagnosis of the suspected patients, follow-up mainly by telemedicine (specially telephone calls) to detect warning signs in case of worsening and subsequent referral to the emergency department; as well as explaining home isolation measures. In the emergency department, it is included the management of suspicious cases and, if it any risk factor is found, complementary tests are carried out for precise diagnosis and admission assessment; In case of oxygen saturation <95% and poor general condition, valuation is requested for admission to the ICU. Depending on the severity of the patient, he/she would be or not a candidate for invasive mechanical ventilation, which must be performed by trained personnel to prevent the spread of the infection minimizing the risk of contagion. ARDS's treatment strategies include pulmonary protection ventilation, prone position, recruitment maneuvers and, less frequently, oxygenation by extracorporeal membrane. Among the specific treatments for COVID-19 stand out mainly drugs to reduce viral load, although sometimes specific drugs will be needed to treat hyperinflammation, hypercoagulability and concomitant infections. One of the goals to be achieved is for patients to recover and be able to successfully return to work; for this purpose, an adequate physical and psychological rehabilitation program is essential, as about 50% have symptoms of anxiety and depression.","Carmona, Luz Elena Ojeda; Nielfa, María Del Carmen Córdoba; Alvarado, Alvaro Luis Diaz",Int Braz J Urol,,282

The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of the pandemic on endoscopy volumes and indications in the US. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from the GI Quality Improvement Consortium (GIQuIC) registry. We compared volumes of colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) during the pandemic (March to September 2020) to before the pandemic (January 2019 through February 2020). The primary outcome was change in monthly volumes. Secondary outcomes included changes in the distribution of procedure indications and in procedure volume by region of US, patient characteristics, trainee involvement, and practice setting, as well as colorectal cancer diagnoses. Results: Among 451 sites with 3,514 endoscopists, the average monthly volume of colonoscopies and EGDs dropped by 38.5% and 33.4%, respectively. There was regional variation, with the greatest and least decline in procedures in the Northeast and South, respectively. There was a modest shift in procedure indications from prevention to diagnostic, an initial increase in performance in the hospital setting, and a decrease in procedures with trainees. The decline in volume of colonoscopy and EGD during the first seven months of the pandemic was equivalent to approximately 2.7 and 2.4 months of pre-pandemic productivity, respectively. Thirty percent fewer colorectal cancers were diagnosed compared to expected. Conclusions: These data on actual endoscopy utilization nationally during the pandemic can help in anticipating impact of delays in care on outcomes and planning for the recovery phase.","Calderwood, Audrey H; Calderwood, Michael S; Lucas Williams, J; Dominitz, Jason A",,,282

We assessed 10 hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease-inhibitor drugs as potential SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. There is a striking structural similarity of the substrate binding clefts of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and HCV NS3/4A protease. Virtual docking experiments show that these HCV drugs can potentially bind into the Mpro substrate-binding cleft. We show that seven HCV drugs inhibit both SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease activity and SARS-CoV-2 virus replication in Vero and/or human cells. However, their Mpro inhibiting activities did not correlate with their antiviral activities. This conundrum is resolved by demonstrating that four HCV protease inhibitor drugs, simeprevir, vaniprevir, paritaprevir, and grazoprevir inhibit the SARS CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro). HCV drugs that inhibit PLpro synergize with the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir to inhibit virus replication, increasing remdesivir's antiviral activity as much as 10-fold, while those that only inhibit Mpro do not synergize with remdesivir.","Bafna, Khushboo; White, Kris; Harish, Balasubramanian; Rosales, Romel; Ramelot, Theresa A; Acton, Thomas B; Moreno, Elena; Kehrer, Thomas; Miorin, Lisa; Royer, Catherine A; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Krug, Robert M; Montelione, Gaetano T",Cell Rep,,282

Pressupõe-se que as políticas de distanciamento social são heterogêneas, apesar da liderança dos governos, ou seja, apresentam certo grau de assimetria nas restrições do funcionamento do comércio e de atividades com potencial de aglomeração de pessoas. Diante disso, foram combinados os debates sobre processo de produção de políticas públicas e sobre autonomia e federalismo, para investigar a influência dos fatores políticos ou técnico-administrativos nas políticas estaduais. Os seguintes procedimentos metodológicos foram utilizados: análise de conteúdo de 134 normativas estaduais; mapeamento do alinhamento político-partidário dos governadores estaduais ao presidente da República; análise dos recursos médico-hospitalares de cada unidade da federação baseada no Cadastro Nacional de Estabelecimentos de Saúde (CNES). O contexto emergencial revelou baixa coordenação interfederativa pelo governo federal, provocando uma competição entre entes federativos e forte liderança estadual na gestão da crise no âmbito local. A pesquisa mostra, por um lado, que as decisões sobre as políticas de distanciamento social não podem ser explicadas por fatores políticos; e por outro, a correspondência entre a capacidade do sistema de saúde local e o nível de rigor das políticas de distanciamento social. Conclui-se que, na atual situação de transtorno social intenso, preferiu-se a racionalidade técnica a barganhas políticas.","Pereira, Ana Karine; Oliveira, Marília Silva; Sampaio, Thiago da Silva",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,282

RESULTS: COVID-19 related mortality rate in malignant patients was significantly higher than patients without malignancy (41.3% vs 17.2%, P = .0001). The risk of death increased significantly in patients with malignancy (OR = 8.4, P = .007) and mechanical ventilation (OR = 3.3, P = .034) independent of other variables. Fever (64.5% vs 43.5%, P = .004), chill (35.5% vs 14.1%, P = .001), malaise (49.5% and 30.4%, P = .008), dry cough (51.6% vs 26.1%, P = .0001), and vomiting (17.2% vs 5.4%, P = .012) were reported significantly lower in cancer patients. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that cancer patients who were infected by COVID-19 may present with atypical symptoms are at higher risk of mortality independent of the demographic data, comorbidities, and treatments.","Shahidsales, Soodabeh; Aledavood, Seyed Amir; Joudi, Mona; Molaie, Fatemeh; Esmaily, Habibollah; Javadinia, Seyed Alireza",Cancer Rep (Hoboken),,282

Female managers’ influence has already been examined in other sectors, but researchers have not studied women CEOs’ role in hotel management and survival. A sample of 2615 Spanish hotel companies was examined during the period 2005–2018 for how their survival was affected by the variables of financial aspects, years of experience and the principal hotel executive’s gender. An econometrics-based survival analysis was conducted using a single complementary log-log model and panel data. The results indicate that some financial variables, such as sales, working capital to total assets ratio and each company’s experience, influence hotel businesses’ survival. The main finding was that women CEOs increase hotels’ survival rate. This CEO gender study is a novelty in the literature on hotel survival.","Escribano-Navas, María Gemar German",Sustainability,,282

339908,Vaccine Hesitancy in the Age of Coronavirus and Fake News: Analysis of Journalistic Sources in the Spanish Quality Press,2020,"Mixed methods studies of human disease that combine surveillance, biomarker, and qualitative data can help elucidate what drives epidemiological trends. Viral genetic data are rarely coupled with other types of data due to legal and ethical concerns about patient privacy. We developed a novel approach to integrate phylogenetic and qualitative methods in order to better target HIV prevention efforts. The overall aim of our mixed methods study was to characterize HIV transmission clusters. We combined surveillance data with HIV genomic data to identify cases whose viruses share enough similarities to suggest a recent common source of infection or participation in linked transmission chains. Cases were recruited through a multi-phase process to obtain consent for recruitment to semi-structured interviews. Through linkage of viral genetic sequences with epidemiological data, we identified individuals in large transmission clusters, which then served as a sampling frame for the interviews. In this article, we describe the multi-phase process and the limitations and challenges encountered. Our approach contributes to the mixed methods research field by demonstrating that phylogenetic analysis and surveillance data can be harnessed to generate a sampling frame for subsequent qualitative data collection, using an explanatory sequential design. The process we developed also respected protections of patient confidentiality. The novel method we devised may offer an opportunity to implement a sampling frame that allows for the recruitment and interview of individuals in high-transmission clusters to better understand what contributes to spread of other infectious diseases, including COVID-19.","Hughes, Shana D.; Woods, William J.; O’Keefe, Kara J.; Delgado, Viva Pipkin Sharon Scheer Susan Truong Hong-Ha M.",Journal of Mixed Methods Research,,282

352869,Shaping the Future of Rare Diseases after a Global Health Emergency: Organisational Points to Consider,2020,"BACKGROUND: Preoperative frailty is strongly associated with postoperative complications and mortality. However, the pathways between frailty, postoperative complications, and mortality are poorly described. The authors hypothesized that the occurrence of postoperative complications would mediate a substantial proportion of the total effect of frailty on mortality after elective noncardiac surgery. METHODS: Following protocol registration, the authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of intermediate- to high-risk elective noncardiac surgery patients (2016) using National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data. The authors conducted Bayesian mediation analysis of the relationship between preoperative frailty (exposure, using the Risk Analysis Index), serious complications (mediator), and 30-day mortality (outcome), comprehensively adjusting for confounders. The authors estimated the total effect of frailty on mortality (composed of the indirect effect mediated by complications and the remaining direct effect of frailty) and estimated the proportion of the frailty-mortality association mediated by complications. RESULTS: The authors identified 205,051 patients; 1,474 (0.7%) died. Complications occurred in 20,211 (9.9%). A 2 SD increase in frailty score resulted in a total association with mortality equal to an odds ratio of 3.79 (95% credible interval, 2.48 to 5.64), resulting from a direct association (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% credible interval, 1.34 to 2.30) and an indirect association mediated by complications (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% credible interval, 1.58 to 2.96). Complications mediated 57.3% (95% credible interval, 40.8 to 73.8) of the frailty-mortality association. Cardiopulmonary complications were the strongest mediators among complication subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Complications mediate more than half of the association between frailty and postoperative mortality in elective noncardiac surgery.","McIsaac, Daniel I; Aucoin, Sylvie D; Bryson, Gregory L; Hamilton, Gavin M; Lalu, Manoj M",Anesthesiology,,282

356232,Associations between COVID-19 Incidence Rates and the Exposure to PM2.5 and NO2: A Nationwide Observational Study in Italy,2020,"To combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the world has vaccination, plasma therapy, herd immunity, and epidemiological interventions as few possible options. The COVID-19 vaccine development is underway and it may take a significant amount of time to develop the vaccine and after development, it will take time to vaccinate the entire population, and plasma therapy has some limitations. Herd immunity can be a plausible option to fight COVID-19 for small countries. But for a country with huge population like India, herd immunity is not a plausible option, because to acquire herd immunity approximately 67% of the population has to be recovered from COVID-19 infection, which will put an extra burden on medical system of the country and will result in a huge loss of human life. Thus epidemiological interventions (complete lockdown, partial lockdown, quarantine, isolation, social distancing, etc.) are some suitable strategies in India to slow down the COVID-19 spread until the vaccine development. In this work, we have suggested the SIR model with intervention, which incorporates the epidemiological interventions in the classical SIR model. To model the effect of the interventions, we have introduced \r{ho} as the intervention parameter. \r{ho} is a cumulative quantity which covers all type of intervention. We have also discussed the supervised machine learning approach to estimate the transmission rate (\b{eta}) for the SIR model with intervention from the prevalence of COVID-19 data in India and some states of India. To validate our model, we present a comparison between the actual and model-predicted number of COVID-19 cases. Using our model, we also present predicted numbers of active and recovered COVID-19 cases till Sept 30, 2020, for entire India and some states of India and also estimate the 95% and 99% confidence interval for the predicted cases.","Verma, Hanuman; Gupta, Akshansh; Niranjan, Utkarsh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10450v1.pdf,282

Yes-associated protein (YAP), a key transcriptional cofactor in Hippo signaling pathway, shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, which is required for the renal tubular epithelial cells repair in the acute phase of AKI. In this study we investigated the role of YAP during ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced AKI to CKD. Mice were subjected to left kidney IR followed by removal of the right kidney on the day before tissue harvests. Mouse shRNA expression adenovirus (Ad-shYAP or Ad-shKLF4) and mouse KLF4 expression adenovirus (Ad-KLF4) were delivered to mice by intrarenal injection on D7 after IR. We showed that the expression and nucleus distribution of YAP were persistently increased until the end of experiment (D21 after IR). The sustained activation of YAP in post-acute phase of AKI was accompanied by renal dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis. Knockdown of YAP significantly attenuated IR-induced renal dysfunction and decreased the expression of fibrogenic factors TGF-ß and CTGF in the kidney. We showed that the expression of the transcription factor KLF4, lined on the upstream of YAP, was also persistently increased. Knockdown on KLF4 attenuated YAP increase and nuclear translocation as well as renal functional deterioration and interstitial fibrosis in IR mice, whereas KLF4 overexpression caused opposite effects. KLF4 increased the expression of ITCH, and ITCH facilitated YAP nuclear translocation via degrading LATS1. Furthermore, we demonstrated in primary cultured renal tubular cells that KLF4 bound to the promoter region of YAP and positively regulates YAP expression. In biopsy sample from CKD patients, we also observed increased expression and nuclear distribution of YAP. In conclusion, the activation of YAP in the post-acute phase of AKI is implicated in renal functional deterioration and fibrosis although it exhibits beneficial effect in acute phase. Reprogramming factor KLF4 is responsible for the persistent activation of YAP. Blocking the activation of KLF4-YAP pathway might be a way to prevent the transition of AKI into CKD.","Xu, Dan; Chen, Pan-Pan; Zheng, Pei-Qing; Yin, Fan; Cheng, Qian; Zhou, Zhuan-Li; Xie, Hong-Yan; Li, Jing-Yao; Ni, Jia-Yun; Wang, Yan-Zhe; Chen, Si-Jia; Zhou, Li; Wang, Xiao-Xia; Liu, Jun; Zhang, Wei; Lu, Li-Min",Acta pharmacol.

We aimed to develop a high-throughput multiplex assay to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to assess immunity to the virus in the general population. METHODS: Spike protein subunits S1 and receptor binding domain, and nucleoprotein were coupled to microspheres. Sera collected before emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 224) and of non-SARS-CoV-2 influenza-like illness (n = 184), and laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 115) with various severities of COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG concentrations. RESULTS: Our assay discriminated SARS-CoV-2-induced antibodies and those induced by other viruses. The assay specificity was 95.1%-99.0% with sensitivity 83.6%-95.7%. By merging the test results for all 3 antigens a specificity of 100% was achieved with a sensitivity of at least 90%. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed higher IgG concentrations and the rate of IgG production increased faster compared to nonhospitalized cases. CONCLUSIONS: The bead-based serological assay for quantitation of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies proved to be robust and can be conducted in many laboratories. We demonstrated that testing of antibodies against multiple antigens increases sensitivity and specificity compared to single-antigen-specific IgG determination.","den Hartog, Gerco; Schepp, Rutger M; Kuijer, Marjan; GeurtsvanKessel, Corine; van Beek, Josine; Rots, Nynke; Koopmans, Marion P G; van der Klis, Fiona R M; van Binnendijk, Robert S",J Infect Dis,,282

METHODS: Coagulopathy, endotheliopathy, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were retrospectively analyzed in a subset (n = 68), followed by a larger cohort (n = 3,780) of patients with COVID-19. Liver histology from 43 patients with COVID-19 was analyzed for endotheliopathy and its relationship to liver injury. Primary human LSECs were used to establish the IL-6 trans-signaling mechanism. RESULTS: Factor VIII, fibrinogen, D-dimer, von Willebrand factor (vWF) activity/antigen (biomarkers of coagulopathy/endotheliopathy) were significantly elevated in patients with COVID-19 and liver injury (elevated ALT). IL-6 positively correlated with vWF antigen (p = 0.02), factor VIII activity (p = 0.02), and D-dimer (p <0.0001). On liver histology, patients with COVID-19 and elevated ALT had significantly increased vWF and platelet staining, supporting a link between liver injury, coagulopathy, and endotheliopathy. Intralobular neutrophils positively correlated with platelet (p <0.0001) and vWF (p <0.01) staining, and IL-6 levels positively correlated with vWF staining (p <0.01). IL-6 trans-signaling leads to increased expression of procoagulant (factor VIII, vWF) and proinflammatory factors, increased cell surface vWF (p <0.01), and increased platelet attachment in LSECs. These effects were blocked by soluble glycoprotein 130 (IL-6 trans-signaling inhibitor), the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, and STAT1/3 small-interfering RNA knockdown. Hepatocyte fibrinogen expression was increased by the supernatant of LSECs subjected to IL-6 trans-signaling. CONCLUSION: IL-6 trans-signaling drives the coagulopathy and hepatic endotheliopathy associated with COVID-19 and could be a possible mechanism behind liver injury in these patients. LAY SUMMARY: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection often have liver injury, but why this occurs remains unknown. High levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its circulating receptor, which form a complex to induce inflammatory signals, have been observed in patients with COVID-19. This paper demonstrates that the IL-6 signaling complex causes harmful changes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and may promote blood clotting and contribute to liver injury.","McConnell, Matthew J; Kawaguchi, Nao; Kondo, Reiichiro; Sonzogni, Aurelio; Licini, Lisa; Valle, Clarissa; Bonaffini, Pietro A; Sironi, Sandro; Alessio, Maria Grazia; Previtali, Giulia; Seghezzi, Michela; Zhang, Xuchen; Lee, Alfred; Pine, Alexander B; Chun, Hyung J; Zhang, Xinbo; Fernandez-Hernando, Carlos; Qing, Hua; Wang, Andrew; Price, Christina; Sun, Zhaoli; Utsumi, Teruo; Hwa, John; Strazzabosco, Mario; Iwakiri, Yasuko",J. hepatol,,282

373287,Impact of COVID-19 on Pediatric Primary Care Visits at Four Academic Institutions in the Carolinas,2021,"Introduction By adhering to government preventative messages to stay-at-home and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, training practitioners in person in implementing a family-based intervention (i.e., Treatnet Family) is not possible. The present study examined the feasibility and acceptability of using digital technology to remotely deliver Treatnet Family training to practitioners in community counselling services in Indonesia. Method Fifteen practitioners, from the association of addiction counsellors in Indonesia, participated in the Treatnet Family workshop remotely. The training was delivered by four national Treatnet Family trainers remotely via a digital platform for five days with additional take-home assignments. Results All practitioners reported that Treatnet Family training have enhanced their skills in working with adolescents and their family. Most practitioners reported having confidence in conducting Treatnet Family and applying core skills of family-based intervention. Participating in the workshop enabled practitioners to learn the core skills of the Treatnet Family at their own pace. However, some practitioners also stated few disadvantages in remote training, including having limited time for the discussion and feeling overwhelmed with the assignments. Some find it hard to attend such training from their home due to distractions. Conclusion Digital technology is acceptable and feasible method for training community practitioners to deliver Treatnet Family to adolescents with SUDs and their families in Indonesia. These findings can inform the way to use digital technology to deliver core family-based skills to community practitioners in other low-resource settings.","Busse, Anja Kashino Wataru Suhartono Sanita Narotama Narendra Pelupessy Dicky Avicenna Fikri Annafi Essau Cecilia A.",Addictive Behaviors Reports,,282

375228,Coronavirus Trauma and African Americans' Mental Health: Seizing Opportunities for Transformational Change,2021,"Extracellular histones are viewed as cytotoxic markers in cell death, apoptosis and NETosis. However, extracellular histones have been found to carry out a number of roles outside their function as a damage associated molecular patterns to signal cell death. Extracellular histones have been seen to act as an early release marker of cell stress, influence cell growth, have antimicrobial activity and bioactive peptides. A suggested method for the intentional secretion of histones has been show through amphisomes, with histones being present in the proteome of healthy biological systems. Airway surface liquid (ASL), present in the lumen of the airways plays a critical role in airway defense and innate immunity. We identified a number of histone derived peptides by de novo peptide sequencing of the airway surface liquid. In ASL overlying H441, Calu3 and BMI-1 transduced human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) we identified similar histone peptides. This was supported by their presence in sputum samples from people with and without Cystic Fibrosis disease. To test whether the ASL histone peptides had a bioactive role we produced synthetic analogues using SPOT peptide synthesis. The peptides were then tested for effects on human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cell growth, viability and intracellular Ca2+[Ca2+]i. One candidate, MAT9 when screened suppressed the rise in [Ca2+]i in response to thapsigargin (p=0.001, n=8 with 16 replicates), but did not affect cell viability or cell growth. When MAT9 (10µM) was tested on H441 airway epithelial cells, it increased the thapsigargin-induced rise in [Ca2+]i (P=0.01, n=6, with 12 replicates). This difference in calcium response could be due to a lack of toll-like receptors (known receptors for histone proteins) in HEK cells which are present in H441 cells. Alongside this MAT9 (10µM) inhibited growth of luminescent Pseudomonas aeruginosa and was able to significantly reduce the growth rate over 4 hours at 5µM (P=0.01, n=4, with 16 replicates). Outside of this antibacterial activity, preliminary data showed some activity against Sars-Cov2 replication in Caco-2 cells. This data indicates that MAT9 is a histone derived peptide with bioactivity, and its proline-alanine sequence may represent a chance to enhance this activity by changing its isomerization.","Biggart, Matthew Hilpert Kai Tarren Robert Baines Deborah",The FASEB Journal,,282

METHODS: A total of 101 severe and critical patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled in this open, case-control, multicentre, prospective study. According to the patients' and their families' willingness, they were divided into two groups. One was named the treatment group, in which the patients received artificial liver therapy plus comprehensive treatment, while the other was named the control group, in which the patients received only comprehensive treatment. Clinical data and laboratory examinations, as well as the 28-day mortality rate, were collected and analysed. RESULTS: This study involved 101 severe/critical patients with COVID-19, among which 50 were in the treatment group and 51 were in the control group. Baseline data comparisons on average age, sex, pre-treatment morbidity, initial symptoms, vital signs, pneumonia severity index (PSI) score, blood routine examination and biochemistry indices et al. showed no difference between the two groups. Cytokine storm was detected, with a significant increase of serum IL-6 level. The serum IL-6 level decreased from 119.94 pg/mL to 20.49 pg/mL in the treatment group and increased from 40.42 pg/mL to 50.81 pg/mL in the control group (p<0.05), indicating that artificial liver therapy significantly decreased serum IL-6. The median duration of viral nucleic acid persistence was 19 days in the treatment group (ranging from 6-67 days) and 17 days in the control group (ranging from 3-68 days), no significant difference was observed (p=0.36). As of 28-day follow-up,17 patients in the treatment group experienced a median weaning time of 24 days, while 11 patients in the control group experienced a median weaning time of 35 days, with no significant difference between the two groups (p=0.33). The 28-day mortality rates were 16% (8/50) in the treatment group and 50.98% (26/51) in the control group, with a significant difference (z=3.70, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Cytokine storm is a key factor in the intensification of COVID-19 pneumonia. The artificial liver therapy blocks the cytokine storm by clearing inflammatory mediators, thus preventing severe cases from progressing to critically ill stages and markedly reducing short-term mortality.","Xiahong, Dai; Zhang, Yimin; Liang, Yu; Ying-An, Jiang; Liang, Chen; Ye, Chen; Ming, Li; Chunming, Gao; Jia, Shang; Shulin, Xiang; Yongguo, Li; Jianzhou, Li; Chenliang, Zhou; Xiaoyang, Zhou; Nan, Chen; Yuanchun, Liu; Jing, Liu; Yuanyuan, Zhang; Xiaobei, Chen; Danhua, Zhu; Hainv, Gao; Lingling, Tang; Mengfei, Zhu; Li, Lanjuan",Artif. organs,,282

We reviewed published studies evaluating the potential roles of these vitamin and zinc for ARIs and COVID-19 using Medline database, medRxiv, and bibliographic references. Results. Vitamins C, D, and E did not reduce incidence of common cold in general, but vitamin C reduced by half in population with physical and environment stresses. Vitamins C and E shortened duration and reduced severity of common cold. A large-dose vitamin A had no effect on recovery from pneumonia. Zinc improved clinical deterioration and pneumonia duration in under five. The effect on preventing COVID-19 morbidity and related-death was lacking. Conclusions. Although the effects of vitamins and zinc on ARIs including COVID-19 were inconclusive, taking these for a short period during pandemic may be beneficial when there is risks of deficiency.","Murni, I.

METHODS: In this ecological study, the interventions implemented in response to the first COVID-19 cases in Turkey were evaluated and the effect of the interventions was demonstrated by calculating the effective reproduction number (Rt) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coro navirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) when people complied with community-based social distancing rules. RESULTS: Google mobility scores decreased by an average of 36.33±22.41 points (range, 2.60 to 84.80) and a median of 43.80 points (interquartile range [IQR], 24.90 to 50.25). The interventions caused the calculated Rt to decrease to 1.88 (95% confidence interval, 1.87 to 1.89). The median growth rate was 19.90% (IQR, 10.90 to 53.90). A positive correlation was found between Google mobility data and Rt (r=0.783; p<0.001). The expected number of cases if the growth rate had not changed was predicted according to Google mobility categories, and it was estimated to be 1 381 922 in total. Thus, community-based interventions were estimated to have prevented 1 299 593 people from being infected. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based social distancing interventions significantly decreased the Rt of COVID-19 by reducing human mobility, and thereby prevented many people from becoming infected. Another important result of this study is that it shows health policy-makers that data on human mobility in the community obtained via mobile phones can be a guide for measures to be taken.","Durmus, Hasan; Gökler, Mehmet Enes; Metintas, Selma",J Prev Med Public Health,,282

A stochastic optimal control model was developed to model public debt dynamics based on the debt accounting identity, where the interest-growth differential obeys a continuous random process. This stochasticity represents both the interest rate risk of public debt and the variability of the growth rate of the nominal Gross Domestic Product combined. The optimal fiscal policy was analyzed in terms of the model parameters. The model was simulated, and results were visualized. The insolvency risk was demonstrated by examining the variance of the optimal process.

406779,Does Lung Ultrasound Have a Role in the Clinical Management of Pregnant Women with SARS COV2 Infection?,2021,"Developing small-scale soft continuum robots with large-angle steering capacity and high-precision manipulation offers broad opportunities in various biomedical settings. However, existing continuum robots reach the bottleneck in actuation on account of the contradiction among small size, compliance actuation, large tender range, high precision, and small dynamic error. Herein, a 3D-printed millimeter-scale soft continuum robot with an ultrathin hollow skeleton wall (300 µm) and a large inner-to-outer ratio (0.8) is reported. After coating a thin ferromagnetic elastomer layer (&#8776;100-150 µm), the proposed soft continuum robot equipped with hybrid actuation (tendon- and magnetic-driven mode) achieves large-angle (up to 100°) steering and high-precision (low to 2 µm for static positioning) micromanipulation simultaneously. Specifically, the robot implements an ultralow dynamic tracking error of &#8776;10 µm, which is &#8776;30-fold improved than the state of art. Combined with a microneedle/knife or nasopharyngeal swab, the robot reveals the potential for versatile biomedical applications, such as drug injection on the target tissue, diseased tissue ablation, and COVID-19 nasopharyngeal sampling. The proposed millimeter-scale soft continuum robot presents remarkable advances in large-range and high-precise actuation, which provides a new method for miniature continuum robot design and finds broad applications in biomedical engineering.","Zhang, Tieshan; Yang, Liu; Yang, Xiong; Tan, Rong; Lu, Haojian; Shen, Yajing",Adv Intell Syst,,282

409417,The Impact of COVID-19 Epidemic Declaration on Psychological Consequences: A Study on Active Weibo Users,2020,"COVID-19 created an extraordinary social situation inwhich governments struggle to mitigate the harmful consequences of the pandemic Challenging times show a society's resilience and capacity for solidarity and cohesion, the government's ability to deal with emergencies effectively, the stability and inclusiveness of political systems, and their aptitude to respect democratic values It is particularly important to examine this period from the point of view of civil society and civil society organizations (CSOs), since civil society plays a pivotal role in the alleviation and dissipation of societal troubles associated with the epidemic, indeed a vital role in curbing the virus The civil sector's strength and resilience too is tested As the studies in this Special Issue show, exploiting the potential of civil society was an option that only some countries have been able to seize - as a result of which they have effectively reduced the consequences of the calamity while increasing a sense of solidarity and belonging in their societies Others, however, failed to recognize the importance of civil society and interpreted the situation as a ""single-actor play on stage"" Neither solidarity nor cohesion play out as values in these latter cases;instead the single actor - government - grabs the opportunity to play the role of the heroic savior and the exclusive problem solver, grabbing for itself both symbolic gains and increasing concentration of power Citizens are expected to trust no one or no organization except the charismatic leader (or party) Thereby is forged a vertical and hierarchical chain of control, rather than a horizontally linked network of trust and cooperation The studies and commentaries in this issue cover nine countries located on an imaginary line beginning in the United Kingdom, and extending through Germany, Austria, Hungary, Turkey, Israel, India, China and South Korea, representing various socio-political and economic systems Embedded in elaborated theoretical understandings, this introductory essay examines the research articles of this Special Issue in which authors unfold the dynamics of CSO-government relations in the context of the world pandemic These accounts sharpen our understanding of the preexisting shape of government-CSOrelations The introduction places the countries on a scalewhich classifies themaccording to the characteristics of civil society-government relations unfolding during the pandemic One of the endpoints is represented by those countries where the CSO's creative and constructive responses to the social challenges were prevented or blocked by the government In this setup, CSOs were ignored at best, and restrictions undercut their abilities to contribute to the process of mitigating the pandemic and its consequences Meanwhile, at the opposite end of this scale, are countries where the government, both central and local, invited civil society partners in the response to COVID-19, orchestrated high-quality and multilevel cross-sectoral cooperation, and provided partners with the necessary (financial) resources In those cases, CSOs were empowered effectively to participate in a process designed to address the epidemic and its consequences in accordance with principles of participatory democracy © 2021 De Gruyter All rights reserved","Kövér, Á",Nonprofit Policy Forum,,282

Results from the COVID Impact Survey,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Recent evidence suggests that ethnic minority groups are disproportionately at increased risk of hospitalisation and death from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Population-based evidence on potential explanatory factors across minority groups and within subgroups is lacking. This study aims to quantify the association between ethnicity and the risk of hospitalisation and mortality due to COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a retrospective cohort study of adults registered across a representative and anonymised national primary care database (QResearch) that includes data on 10 million people in England. Sociodemographic, deprivation, clinical and domicile characteristics will be summarised and compared across ethnic subgroups (categorised as per 2011 census). Cox models will be used to calculate HR for hospitalisation and COVID-19 mortality associated with ethnic group. Potential confounding and explanatory factors (such as demographic, socioeconomic and clinical) will be adjusted for within regression models. The percentage contribution of distinct risk factor classes to the excess risks seen in ethnic groups/subgroups will be calculated. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has undergone ethics review in accordance with the QResearch agreement (reference OX102). Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed manuscripts, presentations at scientific meetings and conferences with national and international stakeholders.","Dambha-Miller, Hajira; Tan, Pui San; Saatci, Defne; Clift, Ashley Kieran; Zaccardi, Francesco; Coupland, Carol; Locufier, Patrick; Davies, Firoza; Khunti, Kamlesh; Griffin, Simon J; Hippisley-Cox, Julia",BMJ Open,,282

Methods: The effective ingredients and targets of Astragali Radix, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma and Saposhnikoviae Radix were searched from the traditional Chinese medicine system pharmacology analysis platform (TCMSP) website, and the protein and protein interactive network of Yupingfeng San was established using the String database (PPI). Cytoscape 3.6.1 software was used for data analysis to extract the Hub network from the PPI network. The KEGG pathway analysis was performed using the String database and the molecular docking was performed using ChemOffice, PyMOL, and Auto Dock software. Results: A total of 45 effective ingredients were obtained with limited screening conditions [oral bioavailability (OB) ≥ 30%; drug-like (DL) ≥ 0.18], and 345 potential targets and 15 key targets of Yupingfeng San were screened. A total of 50 pathways were obtained by KEGG pathway analysis, among which 25 main pathways were selected, including PIK3R1 target regulation PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Ras signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathways and T cell receptor signaling pathways. Conclusion: The active compounds in Yupingfeng San can inhibit the combination between SARS-CoV-2 protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), thus regulating multiple signal pathways (PIK3R1, IGF1R, etc), which plays a role in the prevention of COVID-19.","Zhan, Qun-Zhang; Huang, Ying-Jie; Lin, Shu-Hong; Chu, Qing-Min",Chin.

Against the current COVID-19 pandemic backdrop, the relevance of food literacy's interconnected attributes such as nutritional knowledge, food skills, and food environment is gaining traction. Enhancing health and food literacy in the K-12 school environment are important empowerment tools with the potential to reduce health inequalities as vulnerable people are at risk of limited health literacy. METHODS: We aim to clarify the meaning of food literacy and its relationship to health literacy and other factors influencing eating behavior. RESULTS: We offer a proposed conceptual model depicting connections between relevant theories and constructs in the field of health and nutrition. Concrete actions are offered that contemporary schools can take guided by the utility of the model. CONCLUSIONS: This visual can help guide schools' multidimensional health and food literacy efforts while considering the realities of the current COVID-19 pandemic context and beyond. This model will provide an overarching reference for schools to consider key constructs to support practice, research, policy, and intervention efforts to advance their health and food literacy agendas.","Vamos, Sandra D; Wacker, Corinne C; Welter, Virginia D E; Schlüter, Kirsten",J Sch Health,,282
413995,Kobra Surgery Simulator-A Possibility to Improve Digital Teaching? A Case-Control Study,2021,"PURPOSE: Many patients with cancer, often those with rare cancers such as sarcomas, travel long distances to access expert care. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated widespread changes in delivery of cancer care, including rapid adoption of telemedicine-based care. We aimed to evaluate the impact of telemedicine on patients, clinicians, and care delivery at the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) Sarcoma Unit during the pandemic. METHODS: Data were extracted from patient records for all planned outpatient appointments at the RMH Sarcoma Unit from March 23 to April 24, 2020. Patients and clinicians completed separate questionnaires to understand their experiences. RESULTS: Of 379 planned face-to-face appointments, 283 (75%) were converted to telemedicine. Face-to-face appointments remained for patients who needed urgent start of therapy or performance status assessment. Patients lived on average > 1.5 hours from RMH. Patient satisfaction (n = 108) with telemedicine was high (mean, 9/10), and only 48% (n = 52/108) would not want to hear bad news using telemedicine. Clinicians found telemedicine efficient, with no associated increased workload, compared with face-to-face appointments. Clinicians indicated lack of physical examination did not often affect care provision when using telemedicine. Most clinicians (n = 17; 94%) believed telemedicine use was practice changing; congruently, 80% (n = 86/108) of patients desired some telemedicine as part of their future care, citing reduced cost and travel time. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine can revolutionize delivery of cancer care, particularly for patients with rare cancers who often live far away from expert centers. Our study demonstrates important patient and clinician benefits; assessment of longer-term impact on patient outcomes and health care systems is needed.","Smrke, Alannah; Younger, Eugenie; Wilson, Roger; Husson, Olga; Farag, Sheima; Merry, Eve; Macklin-Doherty, Aislinn; Cojocaru, Elena; Arthur, Amani; Benson, Charlotte; Miah, Aisha B; Zaidi, Shane; Gennatas, Spyridon; Jones, Robin L",JCO Glob Oncol,,282

The objective of our study was to determine whether markers of coagulation and hemostatic activation (MOCHA) on admission could identify COVID-19 patients at risk for thrombotic events. Methods: COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary academic healthcare system from April 3, 2020 to July 31, 2020 underwent admission testing of MOCHA profile parameters (plasma d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and fibrin monomer). For this analysis we excluded patients on outpatient anticoagulation therapy preceding admission. Prespecified endpoints monitored during hospitalization included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and access line thrombosis. Results: During the study period, 276 patients were included in the analysis cohort (mean age 59 ± 6.3 years, 47% female, 83% non-white race). Arterial and venous thrombotic events occurred in 43 (16%) patients (see Table). Each coagulation marker was independently associated with the composite endpoint (p&lt;0.05). Admission MOCHA with ≥ 2 abnormalities was associated with the composite endpoint (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2-8.3), ICU admission (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.8-5.5) and intubation (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5-5.5). Admission MOCHA with &lt; 2 abnormalities (26% of the cohort) had sensitivity of 88% and a negative predictive value of 93% for an in-hospital endpoint. Conclusion: Admission MOCHA with ≥ 2 abnormalities identified COVID-19 patients at risk for a thrombotic event, ICU admission and intubation while &lt; 2 abnormalities identified a subgroup of patients who were at low risk for thrombotic events. Our results suggest that an admission MOCHA profile can be useful to risk stratify COVID-19 patients. Further studies are needed to determine whether an admission MOCHA profile can guide anticoagulation therapy and improve overall clinical outcomes.(Figure Presented).","Alabyad, D.; Rangaraju, S.; Liu, M.; Imran, R.; Kempton, C.

This virus is the cause of the COVID-19 disease. This infection later spread to the whole world. The goal of this article is to present the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with COVID-19 treated in the Faculty Hospital Pilsen. METHODS: In this monocentric, retrospective study, clinical and biochemical data of 89 adult patients with COVID-19 was analyzed. These patients were in the care of the Faculty Hospital Pilsen between March 14 and April 7. RESULTS: In this cohort, made up of 89 patients, 63 were treated as outpatients and 26 were hospitalized. 10 patients required intensive care. The most common symptoms among patients were cough and fever. Dyspnea was present in 29 patients. A CT scan showed bilateral pneumonia in 23 of the admitted patients. Fever and bilateral pneumonia were significantly more common in patients ≥ 60 years old (p=0.047, and p=0.001, respectively). Of lab results, the patients in intensive care had significantly higher values of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin 6, myoglobin and ferritin. CONCLUSION: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and cough. These two symptoms are simultaneously present in more than half the cases. Approximately 1/10th of patients requires intensive care. Higher values of lactate dehydrogenase, myoglobin and ferritin on patient admission appear to be a strong predictive factor of the patient's status progressing into requiring ICU attention.","Šín, R.; Kubiska, M.; Cmorej, P.

424395,"Psychosocial Correlates of Suicidal Behavior among Adolescents under Confinement Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Aguascalientes, Mexico: A Cross-Sectional Population Survey",2021,"OBJECTIVES: Existing literature on how employment loss affects depression has struggled to address potential endogeneity bias caused by reverse causality. The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique natural experiment because the source of unemployment is very likely to be exogenous to the individual. This study assessed the effect of job loss and job furlough on the mental health of individuals in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA AND METHODS: The data for the study came from the first and second waves of the national survey, the National Income Dynamics-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM), conducted during May-June and July-August 2020, respectively. The sample for NIDS-CRAM was drawn from an earlier national survey, conducted in 2017, which had collected data on mental health. Questions on depressive symptoms during the lockdown were asked in Wave 2 of NIDS-CRAM, using a 2-question version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). The PHQ-2 responses (0-6 on the discrete scale) were regrouped into four categories making the ordered logit regression model the most suited for assessing the impact of employment status on depressive symptoms. RESULTS: The study revealed that adults who retained paid employment during the COVID-19 lockdown had significantly lower depression scores than adults who lost employment. The benefits of employment also accumulated over time, underscoring the effect of unemployment duration on mental health. The analysis revealed no mental health benefits to being furloughed (on unpaid leave), but paid leave had a strong and significant positive effect on the mental health of adults. CONCLUSIONS: The economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented job losses, which impaired mental wellbeing significantly. Health policy responses to the crisis therefore need to focus on both physical and mental health interventions.","Posel, Dorrit; Oyenubi, Adeola; Kollamparambil, Umakrishnan",PLoS One,,282

We examined the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 and its determinants in six ethnic groups in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. MethodsWe analyzed participants enrolled in the population-based HELIUS cohort, who were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and answered COVID-19-related questions between June 24-October 9, 2020 (after the first wave) and November 23, 2020-March 31, 2021 (during the second wave). We modeled SARS-CoV-2 incidence from January 1, 2020-March 31, 2021 using Markov models adjusted for age and sex. We compared incidence between ethnic groups over time and identified determinants of incident infection within ethnic groups. Findings2,497 participants were tested after the first wave; 2,083 (83{middle dot}4%) were tested during the second wave. Median age at first visit was 54 years (interquartile range=44-61); 56{middle dot}6% were female. Compared to Dutch-origin participants (15{middle dot}9%), cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence was higher in participants of South-Asian Surinamese (25{middle dot}0%; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=1{middle dot}66;95%CI=1{middle dot}16-2{middle dot}40), African Surinamese (28{middle dot}9%;aHR=1{middle dot}97;95%CI=1{middle dot}37-2{middle dot}83), Turkish (37{middle dot}0%;aHR=2{middle dot}67;95%CI=1{middle dot}89-3{middle dot}78), Moroccan (41{middle dot}9%;aHR=3{middle dot}13;95%CI=2{middle dot}22-4{middle dot}42), and Ghanaian (64{middle dot}6%;aHR=6{middle dot}00;95%CI=4{middle dot}33-8{middle dot}30) origin. Compared to those of Dutch origin, differences in incidence became wider during the second versus first wave for all ethnic minority groups (all p for interaction<0.05), except Ghanaians. Having household members with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, larger household size, and low health literacy were common determinants of SARS-CoV-2 incidence across groups. InterpretationSARS-CoV-2 incidence was higher in the largest ethnic minority groups of Amsterdam, particularly during the second wave.

428544,"Individual Circadian Preference, Shift Work, and Risk of Medication Errors: A Cross-Sectional Web Survey among Italian Midwives",2020,"BACKGROUND: There has been significant recent prioritization and investment in the immunization program in Ethiopia. However, coverage rates have stagnated and remained low for many years, suggesting the presence of systemic barriers to implementation. Hence, there is a need to consolidate the existing knowledge, in order to address them and consequently improve program effectiveness. METHODS: A thorough literature review and Delphi method were used. In this review, we searched Pubmed/Medline, WHO library, Science direct, Cochrane library, Google scholar and Google using different combinations of search strategies. Studies that applied any study design, data collection and analysis methods related to immunization program were included. In the Delphi method, a panel of 28 national and international experts were participated to identify current evidence gaps and set research priorities under the immunization program. RESULTS: In this review, a total of 55 studies and national documents were included. The review showed that the vaccination coverage ranged from 20.6% in Afar to 91.7% in Amhara region with large inequities related to socio-economic, health service access and knowledge about vaccination across different settings. Only one study reported evidence on timeliness of immunization as 60%. The review revealed that 80% of health facilities provide immunization service nationally while service availability was only 2% in private health facilities. This review indicated that poor vaccine storage, vaccine shortage, service interruptions, poor defaulter tracing, low community engagement and poor documentation were the main barriers for the Expanded Program on Immunization with variations across different regions. Through expert panel of discussion using Delphi method, 10 priority research areas were identified across different domains of the immunization program at national level. CONCLUSION: We found out that there is substantial knowledge on vaccination coverage, however, there is little evidence on timeliness of vaccination. The existing barriers that affect full immunization coverage also varied from context to context which indicates there is a need to design and implement evidence based locally tailored interventions. This review also indicated evidence gaps with more focus on health system related implementation barriers at lower level and identified further research priorities in the immunization program of Ethiopia.","Tilahun, Binyam; Mekonnen, Zeleke; Sharkey, Alyssa; Shahabuddin, Asm; Feletto, Marta; Zelalem, Meseret; Sheikh, Kabir",BMC Public Health,,282
428661,Mental and Physical Factors Influencing Wellbeing among South Korean Emergency Workers,2020,"BACKGROUND: Because of the COVID-19 epidemic, people are mostly isolated at home and must seek medical advice over the internet In addition, government authorities are currently investing greater efforts in developing internet hospitals PURPOSE: The purpose of this essay was to assess how outpatients feel about online outpatient clinics and to analyze the factors that affect their satisfaction and willingness to return to these clinics The results provide advice regarding how to more effectively encourage patients to use online outpatient clinics METHODS: A self-developed questionnaire was used to survey 191 patients who had visited the online outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital in Sichuan Province from January to July 2019 A descriptive analysis was conducted on the collected data, and factors influencing satisfaction were identified RESULTS: The majority of the surveyed patients were young or middle-aged (92 7%) and 42 9% held a college degree or higher Nearly three-quarters (72 2%) expressed feeling satisfied or better with the online outpatient clinic, with 31 4% of these expressing feeling very satisfied Nearly all (91 1%) expressed the opinion that the online outpatient clinic had improved their awareness of health self-management Furthermore, 176 (92 1%) were willing to use the online outpatient clinic again The results of univariate analysis showed that the main factors negatively influencing re-use of the online outpatient clinic were: failure to solve the problem in a timely manner (chi2 = 8 603, p = 045), the complicated process of online registration (chi2 = 8 322, p = 016), the failure of the online physical examination (chi2 = 8 958, p = 015), and unreliable quality (chi2 = 15 373, p = 004) CONCLUSIONS: The participants surveyed in this study reported a lower satisfaction for their online outpatient clinic experience than reported in similar surveys of traditional outpatient services However, many reported that their health-related self-management awareness had improved after use, indicating that they feel better about the online outpatient clinic The factors that affected willingness to reuse to the online outpatient clinic related mainly to imperfections related to the clinic and its inability to adequately meet patient needs Online outpatient clinics should simplify the process of registration, improve functions, and increase service functions such as online examination appointments and follow-up visits to improve patient satisfaction","Peng, Y.

429976,Implementing Public Health Strategies-The Need for Educational Initiatives: A Systematic Review,2021,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the affective and cognitive risk perceptions in the general population of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) during the 2015 MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea and the influencing factors. DESIGN: Serial cross-sectional design with four consecutive surveys. SETTING: Nationwide general population in South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: Overall 4010 respondents (aged 19 years and over) from the general population during the MERS-CoV epidemic were included. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were (1) affective risk perception, (2) cognitive risk perception, and (3) trust in the government. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors (demographic, socioeconomic, area and political orientation) associated with risk perceptions. RESULTS: Both affective and cognitive risk perceptions decreased as the MERS-CoV epidemic progressed. Proportions of affective risk perception were higher in all surveys and slowly decreased compared with cognitive risk perception over time. Females (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.72-2.00; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.86) and lower self-reported household economic status respondents were more likely to perceive the affective risk. The older the adults, the higher the affective risk perception, but the lower the cognitive risk perception compared with younger adults. The respondents who had low trust in the government had higher affective (aOR 2.19-3.11; 95 CI 1.44 to 4.67) and cognitive (aOR 3.55-5.41; 95 CI 1.44 to 9.01) risk perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that even if cognitive risk perception is dissolved, affective risk perception can continue during MERS-CoV epidemic. Risk perception associating factors (ie, gender, age and self-reported household economic status) appear to be noticeably different between affective and cognitive dimensions. It also indicates that trust in the government influences affective risk perception and cognitive risk perception. There is a need for further efforts to understand the mechanism regarding the general public's risk perception for eï¬ective risk communication.","Jang, Won Mo; Kim, Un-Na; Jang, Deok Hyun; Jung, Hyemin; Cho, Sanghyun; Eun, Sang Jun; Lee, Jin Yong",BMJ Open,,282

430551,A Methodology Based on Expert Systems for the Early Detection and Prevention of Hypoxemic Clinical Cases,2020,"BACKGROUND: A xenograft consisting of equine collagen coated with human fibrinogen and thrombin (TachoSil; Baxter, CA) has recently been introduced in grafting procedures for Peyronie's disease (PD). AIM: To describe the results of a multicenter prospective registry on patients with PD undergoing plaque incision or and grafting (PIG) or plaque excision and grafting (PEG) with collagen fleece TachoSil, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this procedure. METHODS: A prospective non-controlled multicenter study of patients with PD was performed between May 2016 and March 2018. Patients from 10 centers with stable PD for at least 3 months, difficulties in sexual intercourse, normal erectile function with or without pharmacological treatment, curvature >45°, and/or penile shortening and/or complex deformities were included. All patients underwent PIG/PEG with collagen fleece TachoSil. OUTCOMES: The main outcome measure of this study were penile curvature correction (intraoperative), penile shortening (intraoperative), erectile function with the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) and the Erection Hardness Score, subjective patient outcomes with non-validated questionnaires, and complications. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients were enrolled in the study. The mean (SD) preoperative penile curvature was 72.8° (17.0). PIG was the preferred technique (80.8%). Intraoperatively, complete curvature correction was achieved in 92.3%, and no significant penile shortening was recorded in 80.8% of subjects. Subjective penile shortening was reported in 83.3% of patients at 6 months. No objective measurement of penile curvature and length was recorded during follow-up. No statistically significant difference from the baseline was found in IIEF-5 and Erection Hardness Score at 3 or at 6 months, although 16.7% of men experienced a worsening of IIEF-5 scores and 14.3% required de novo phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor use. 6 months after surgery, 78.5% of men were satisfied with intervention. Swelling and ecchymosis/hematoma were the most common perioperative complications (40.4%). 2 cases (3.8%) of wound infection were recorded. At 6 months, 35.7% of patients reported mild penile hypesthesia. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our results confirm the high success rate of grafting with TachoSil, and the surgeon perceived low percentage of penile shortening. STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: This is the first multicentre study on patients with PD undergoing grafting with TachoSil without concomitant placement of penile prosthesis. The main limitations are the short follow-up and the relatively small sample size. CONCLUSION: Grafting with TachoSil after PIG/PEG in patients with PD is an effective and safe procedure. Among the main advantages of this technique, there are ease of use of the graft and reduced operative time. Fernández-Pascual E, Manfredi C, Torremadé J, et al.

431006,"Body Mass, Physical Activity and Eating Habits Changes during the First COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown in Poland",2021,"BACKGROUND: The accelerated vaccine development in response to the COVID-19 pandemic should lead to a vaccine being available early 2021, albeit in limited supply and possibly without full vaccine acceptance. We assessed the short-term impact of a COVID-19 immunization program with varying constraints on population health and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) needs. METHODS: A SARS-CoV-2 transmission model was calibrated to French epidemiological data. We defined several vaccine implementation scenarios starting in January 2021 based on timing of discontinuation of NPIs, supply and uptake constraints, and their relaxation. We assessed the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations averted, the need for and number of days with NPIs in place over the 2021-2022 period. RESULTS: An immunisation program under constraints could reduce the burden of COVID-19 hospitalizations by 9-40% if the vaccine prevents against infections. Relaxation of constraints not only reduces further COVID-19 hospitalizations (30-39% incremental reduction), it also allows for NPIs to be discontinued post-2021 (0 days with NPIs in 2022 versus 11 to 125 days for vaccination programs under constraints and 327 in the absence of vaccination). CONCLUSION: For 2021, COVID-19 control is expected to rely on a combination of NPIs and the outcome of early immunisation programs. The ability to overcome supply and uptake constraints will help prevent the need for further NPIs post-2021. As the programs expand, efficiency assessments will be needed to ensure optimisation of control policies post-emergency use.","Coudeville, Laurent; Jollivet, Ombeline; Mahé, Cedric; Chaves, Sandra; Gomez, Gabriela B",PLoS One,,282

432961,Hyponatremia in Infectious Diseases-A Literature Review,2020,"Background Comprehensive information has been published on laboratory tests which may predict worse outcome in Asian populations with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study is to describe laboratory findings in a group of Italian COVID-19 patients in the area of Valcamonica, and correlate abnormalities with disease severity. Methods The final study population consisted of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (70 who died during hospital stay and 74 who survived and could be discharged) between March 1 and 30, 2020, in Valcamonica Hospital. Demographical, clinical and laboratory data were collected upon hospital admission and were then correlated with outcome (i.e. in-hospital death vs. discharge). Results Compared to patients who could be finally discharged, those who died during hospital stay displayed significantly higher values of serum glucose, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), urea, creatinine, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hscTnI), prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-dimer, C reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and leukocytes (especially neutrophils), whilst values of albumin, hemoglobin and lymphocytes were significantly decreased. In multiple regression analysis, LDH, CRP, neutrophils, lymphocytes, albumin, APTT and age remained significant predictors of in-hospital death. A regression model incorporating these variables explained 80% of overall variance of in-hospital death. Conclusions The most important laboratory abnormalities described here in a subset of European COVID-19 patients residing in Valcamonica are highly predictive of in-hospital death and may be useful for guiding risk assessment and clinical decision-making.","Bonetti, Graziella; Manelli, Filippo; Patroni, Andrea; Bettinardi, Alessandra; Borrelli, Gianluca; Fiordalisi, Gianfranco; Marino, Antonio; Menolfi, Annamaria; Saggini, Sara; Volpi, Roberta; Anesi, Adriano; Lippi, Giuseppe",Clin Chem Lab Med,,282

433685,"Airflow and Air Velocity Measurements While Playing Wind Instruments, with Respect to Risk Assessment of a SARS-CoV-2 Infection",2021,"Bimetallic Fe- and Mo-embedded N-enriched porous biochar (Fe-Mo@N-BC) is developed and serves as a cost-effective and highly efficient catalyst for mineralization of non-biodegradation organic contaminants. Fe-Mo@N-BC was prepared by pyrolysis of complex Fe/Mo -containing precursors. Transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping suggested that Fe and Mo are uniformly dispersed in nitrogen-doped biochar with hierarchical mesopores. In comparison to Fe@N-BC and Mo@N-BC, Fe-Mo@N-BC exhibited a superior activity for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The stable activity was ascribed to N-doping and synergistic effect of Fe and Mo species, where both Fe-Nx and Mo-Nx can simultaneously serve as the active sites and N-BC can act as a carrier and an activator as well as an electron mediator. Electron paramagnetic resonance and quenching experiments indicated that HOâ¢, O2â¢- and 1O2 were responsible for organic degradation. The effects of PMS dosage, initial Orange II concentration, temperature, solution pH, coexisting anions and humic acids on organic degradation were also investigated. With the assistance of an external magnet, Fe-Mo@N-BC can be easily separated after reaction and remains stable in the reusability tests. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy towards the fabrication of Fe, Mo-embedded N-enriched porous biochar catalysts for the detoxification of organic contaminants.","Yao, Yunjin; Hu, Huanhuan; Zheng, Hongda; Hu, Hongwei; Tang, Yinghao; Liu, Xiaoyan; Wang, Shaobin",J Hazard Mater,,282

440758,Career Adaptability Research: A Literature Review with Scientific Knowledge Mapping in Web of Science,2020,"Importance: Patients with cancer undergoing treatment are at high risk of COVID-19 following SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, their ability to produce an adequate antibody response to messenger RNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is unclear. Objective: To evaluate rates of antispike (anti-S) antibody response to a BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with cancer who are undergoing systemic treatment vs healthy controls. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study included 102 adult patients with solid tumors undergoing active intravenous anticancer treatment and 78 controls who received the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine at least 12 days before enrollment. The controls were taken from a convenience sample of the patients' family/caregivers who accompanied them to treatment. The study was conducted between February 22, 2021, and March 15, 2021 at Davidoff Cancer Center at Beilinson Hospital (Petah Tikva, Israel). Interventions: Blood samples were drawn from the study participants. Serum samples were analyzed and the titers of the IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain were determined using a commercially available immunoassay. Seropositivity was defined as 50 or greater AU/mL. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the rate of seropositivity. Secondary outcomes included comparisons of IgG titers and identifying factors that were associated with seropositivity using univariate/multivariable analyses. Results: The analysis included 180 participants, which comprised 102 patients with cancer (median [interquartile range (IQR)] age, 66 [56-72] years; 58 men [57%]) and 78 healthy controls (median [IQR] age, 62 [49-70] years; 25 men [32%]). The most common tumor type was gastrointestinal (29 [28%]). In the patient group, 92 (90%) were seropositive for SARS-CoV 2 antispike IgG antibodies after the second vaccine dose, whereas in the control group, all were seropositive. The median IgG titer in the patients with cancer was significantly lower than that in the controls (1931 [IQR, 509-4386] AU/mL vs 7160 [IQR, 3129-11â¯241] AU/mL; P < .001). In a multivariable analysis, the only variable that was significantly associated with lower IgG titers was treatment with chemotherapy plus immunotherapy (ß, -3.5; 95% CI, -5.6 to -1.5). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of patients with cancer who were receiving active systemic therapy, 90% of patients exhibited adequate antibody response to the BNT162b2 vaccine, although their antibody titers were significantly lower than those of healthy controls. Further research into the clinical relevance of lower titers and their durability is required. Nonetheless, the data support vaccinating patients with cancer as a high priority, even during therapy.","Massarweh, Amir; Eliakim-Raz, Noa; Stemmer, Amos; Levy-Barda, Adva; Yust-Katz, Shlomit; Zer, Alona; Benouaich-Amiel, Alexandra; Ben-Zvi, Haim; Moskovits, Neta; Brenner, Baruch; Bishara, Jihad; Yahav, Dafna; Tadmor, Boaz; Zaks, Tal; Stemmer, Salomon M",JAMA oncol.

Based on our previous studies demonstrating that over-expression of Activin-A in murine lung causes pathology sharing key features of COVID-19, we hypothesized that Activins and their natural inhibitor Follistatin might be particularly relevant to COVID-19 pathophysiology. METHODS: Activin-A, Activin-B and Follistatin levels were retrospectively analyzed in 574 serum samples from 263 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in three independent centers, and compared with common demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters. Optimal-scaling with ridge-regression was used to screen variables and establish a prediction model. RESULT: The Activin/Follistatin-axis was significantly deregulated during the course of COVID-19, correlated with severity and independently associated with mortality. FACT-CLINYCoD, a novel disease scoring system, adding one point for each of Follistatin>6235pg/ml, Activin-A>591pg/ml, Activin-B>249pg/ml, CRP>10.3mg/dL, LDH>427U/L, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, Neutrophil/Lymphocyte-Ratio>5.6, Age>61, Comorbidities>1 and D-dimers>1097ng/ml, efficiently predicted fatal outcome in an initial cohort (AUC: 0.951; 95%CI: 0.919-0.983, p<10 -6). Two independent cohorts that were used for validation indicated similar AUC values. CONCLUSIONS: This study unravels strong link between Activin/Follistatin-axis and COVID-19 mortality and introduces FACT-CLINYCoD, a novel pathophysiology-based tool that allows dynamic prediction of disease outcome, supporting clinical decision making.","Synolaki, Evgenia; Papadopoulos, Vasileios; Divolis, Georgios; Tsahouridou, Olga; Gavriilidis, Efstratios; Loli, Georgia; Gavriil, Ariana; Tsigalou, Christina; Tziolos, Nikolaos R; Sertaridou, Eleni; Kalra, Bhanu; Kumar, Ajay; Rafailidis, Petros; Pasternack, Arja; Boumpas, Dimitrios T; Germanidis, Georgios; Ritvos, Olli; Metallidis, Simeon; Skendros, Panagiotis; Sideras, Paschalis",J. infect. dis,,282

The virus that causes this disease is indicated originating from animals traded in a live animal market in Wuhan, China. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 can attack lung cells because there are many conserved receptor entries, namely Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2. The presence of this virus in host cells will initiate various protective responses leading to pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. This review aimed to provide an overview related to this virus and examine the body's responses and possible therapies. METHOD: We searched PubMed databases for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. Full texts were retrieved, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review. RESULTS: We provide a complete review related to structure, origin, and how the body responds to this virus infection and explain the possibility of an immune system over-reaction or cytokine storm. We also include an explanation of how this virus creates modes of avoidance to evade immune system attacks. We further explain the therapeutic approaches that can be taken in the treatment and prevention of this viral infection.

An Experimental Study,2020,"Background: Insomnia is a widespread disease in adults and has a high prevalence rate. As sleep disturbances are a risk factor concerning mental and physical health, prevention and early intervention are necessary. Thus, the aim of this study was to implement a self-learning prevention and early intervention training for university staff members. We adapted an established cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) intervention as an online version for use during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) crisis. Methods: Development and adaptation procedure of the internet-based CBT­I (iCBT-I) prevention and early intervention training is described. Sessions and topics are shown in detail. The Online Sleep Prevention and Treatment Acceptance questionnaire (OSTA) and the Online Sleep Prevention and Treatment Feedback questionnaire (OSTF) were used to assess acceptance. Sleep problems of university staff members were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire (PSQI). Results: The online-adapted version consisted of seven modules. Contents of sessions and topics were implemented based on video clips. Drawings were added to information regarding sleep and sleep hygiene as well as addressing stress and cognitions. In all, 15 individuals participated in this pilot study. The new iCBT­I self-learning prevention training was well accepted. In addition, participants scored the online version as helpful based on the OSTA. Prior to online training, 89% of the participants reported impaired sleep quality or insomnia symptoms, and 56% had a PSQI score over 10. After training 78% of participants showed reduced sleep problems according to PSQI and 56% reached clinically significant enhancement. In addition, after training 44% were healthy sleepers. Discussion: This is the first iCBT­I prevention and early intervention training for university staff members. The training by participants was very well accepted and they scored the videos as very helpful. Sleep problems decreased after online training. However, further studies with larger samples and more sleep-related assessment strategies, e.g., actigraphy and sleep log, are necessary.","Schlarb, Angelika A; Fründ, Jan Philipp; Kovacevic, Tatjana; Faber, Jasmin",Somnologie (Berl),,282

It assessed the difference in performance between (i) attending one instructor-led training session in donning and doffing PPE one month prior to assessment, and (ii) watching training videos over the month. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial pilot study divided 21 medical students and junior doctors into 2 groups. Control group participants attended one instructor-led training session. Video group participants watched training videos demonstrating the same procedures, which they could freely watch again at home. After one month, a doctor performed a blind evaluation of performance using checklists. RESULTS: 19 participants were assessed after one month. The mean donning score was 84.8/100 for the instructor-led group and 88/100 for the video group; mean effect size 3,2 (95%CI: -7,5 to 9,5). The mean doffing score was 79.1/100 for the instructor group and 73.9/100 for the video group; mean effect size 5,2 (95%CI: -7,6 to 18). CONCLUSION: Our study found no significant difference in donning and doffing score between instructor-led and video lessons. Video training could be a fast and resource-efficient method of training in PPE donning and doffing in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Christensen, Liva; Rasmussen, Charlotte Schang; Benfield, Thomas; Franc, Jeffrey Michael",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,282

453013,Occupational Exposure in the Lombardy Region (Italy) to SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Results from the MUSTANG-OCCUPATION-COVID-19 Study,2021,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used quite successfully for semantic segmentation of brain tumors. However, current CNNs and attention mechanisms are stochastic in nature and neglect the morphological indicators used by radiologists to manually annotate regions of interest. In this paper, we introduce a channel and spatial wise asymmetric attention (CASPIAN) by leveraging the inherent structure of tumors to detect regions of saliency. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed layer, we integrate this into a well-established convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to achieve higher Dice scores, with less GPU resources. Also, we investigate the inclusion of auxiliary multiscale and multiplanar attention branches to increase the spatial context crucial in semantic segmentation tasks. The resulting architecture is the new CASPIANET++, which achieves Dice Scores of 91.19% whole tumor, 87.6% for tumor core and 81.03% for enhancing tumor. Furthermore, driven by the scarcity of brain tumor data, we investigate the Noisy Student method for segmentation tasks. Our new Noisy Student Curriculum Learning paradigm, which infuses noise incrementally to increase the complexity of the training images exposed to the network, further boosts the enhancing tumor region to 81.53%. Additional validation performed on the BraTS2020 data shows that the Noisy Student Curriculum Learning method works well without any additional training or finetuning.","Liew, Andrea; Lee, Chun Cheng; Lan, Boon Leong; Tan, Maxine",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04099v1.pdf,282

However, whether AMOTL2 participates in asthma pathogenesis has not been fully studied. In the present work, we studied the possible role and mechanism of AMOTL2 in regulating transforming growth factor-ß1 (TGF-ß1)-induced proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition of airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. Our results showed marked reductions in the abundance of AMOTL2 in TGF-ß1-stimulated ASM cells. Cellular functional investigations confirmed that the up-regulation of AMOTL2 dramatically decreased the proliferation and ECM deposition induced by TGF-ß1 in ASM cells. In contrast, the depletion of AMOTL2 exacerbated TGF-ß1-induced ASM cell proliferation and ECM deposition. Further research revealed that the overexpression of AMOTL2 restrained the activation of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) in TGF-ß1-stimulated ASM cells. Moreover, the reactivation of YAP1 markedly reversed AMOTL2-mediated suppression of TGF-ß1-induced ASM cell proliferation and ECM deposition. Together, these findings suggest that AMOTL2 restrains TGF-ß1-induced proliferation and ECM deposition of ASM cells by down-regulating YAP1 activation.","Fang, Ping; Deng, Wen-Jing; Fan, Na; Shi, Jie; Shi, Hong-Yang; Ou, Ling; Pan, Jian-Li; Yang, Shuan-Ying",Environ. toxicol,,282

455917,Bibliometric Studies and Worldwide Research Trends on Global Health,2020,"BACKGROUND: An established objective and standardized reporting of clinical severity and disease progression in COVID-19 is still not established. We validated and compared the usefulness of two classification systems reported earlier-a severity grading proposed by Siddiqi and a system from the National Australian COVID-19 guideline. Both had not been validated externally and were now tested for their ability to predict complications. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre observational study, patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 across all severity stages were enrolled. The clinical severity was graded at admission and during hospitalization. Multivariate Cox regression was used to identify independent risk factors for mortality, a composite primary (mortality, incident acute respiratory distress syndrome, incident mechanical ventilation), a secondary endpoint (mortality, incident acute myocardial injury, incident venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or stroke) and progression of severity grades. RESULTS: Of 109 patients 17 died, 31 and 48 developed the primary and secondary endpoint, respectively. Worsening of the severity grade by at least one stage occurred in 27 and 28 patients, respectively. Siddiqi and Australian classification were identified as independent predictors for the primary endpoint (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.30, p<0.001 and aHR 2.08, p<0.001), for the secondary endpoint (aHR 2.12, p<0.001 and aHR 1.79, p<0.001) and mortality (aHR 2.30, p = 0.071 and aHR 1.98, p = 0.017). Both classification systems showed very good agreement regarding initial grading and good agreement regarding progression of severity stages. CONCLUSIONS: Standardized and objective severity grading is useful to unequivocally stratify patients presenting with COVID-19 for their individual risk of complications.","Salbach, Christian; Mueller-Hennessen, Matthias; Biener, Moritz; Stoyanov, Kiril M; Vafaie, Mehrshad; Preusch, Michael R; Kihm, Lars P; Merle, Uta; Schnitzler, Paul; Katus, Hugo A; Giannitsis, Evangelos",PLoS One,,282

The purpose of this paper is to explore the following research question: How do TE teachers see emergency remote teaching (ERT) transitions to blended learning into the next academic year affecting their profession? Design/methodology/approach: A snowball and convenience sampling design was used to recruit specialist teachers in TE through their professional organization and were asked to respond to the question: What are your concerns about the future of teaching TE remotely? The qualitative data collected from the participants (N = 42) was analyzed thematically (Braun and Clarke, 2006). Findings: The analysis revealed that the switch to ERT impacted the teachers’ ability to support hands-on competency development owing to inequitable student access to tools, materials and resources, all of which affected student motivation and engagement. As a result, teachers raised questions about the overall effectiveness of online learning approaches and TE’s future and sustainability if offered completely online. Originality/value: This research is the first of its kind exploring the experiences of TE teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In answer to the challenges identified by teachers, the authors offer a blended learning design framework informed by pandemic transformed pedagogy that can serve as a model for educators to use when designing blended instruction.","Code, Jillianne; Ralph, Rachel; Forde, Kieran",inform.Learn.Sci,,282

In this study, we assess structural and biochemical aspects of viral fitness for these two variants using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), ACE2-binding and antibody neutralization analyses. Both variants demonstrate escape of antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain, an important immune hotspot for neutralizing epitopes. Compared to wild-type and Kappa lineages, Delta variant spike proteins show modest increase in ACE2 affinity, likely due to enhanced electrostatic complementarity at the RBD-ACE2 interface, which we characterize by cryo-EM. Unexpectedly, Kappa variant spike trimers form a novel head-to-head dimer-of-trimers assembly, which we demonstrate is a result of the E484Q mutation. The combination of increased antibody escape and enhanced ACE2 binding provides an explanation, in part, for the rapid global dominance of the Delta variant.","Saville, James W.; Mannar, Dhiraj; Zhu, Xing; Srivastava, Shanti S.; Berezuk, Alison M.; Demers, Jean-Philippe; Zhou, Steven; Tuttle, Katharine; Sekirov, Inna; Kim, Andrew; Li, Wei; Dimiter, Dimitrov S.; Subramaniam, Sriram",,,282
463887,"Portuguese Nurses' Stress, Anxiety, and Depression Reduction Strategies during the COVID-19 Outbreak",2021,"In the wake of COVID-19, the world has become a more uncertain environment-a breeding ground for stress and anxiety, especially for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study examined stress, anxiety, and coping in a data-driven, real-time assessment of 122 youth with and without ASD and their parents at the height of the COVID-19 shutdown and three-months later. Standardized measures were administered to ascertain stress and coping explicitly related to the pandemic (RSQ COVID-19-Child [self-report], Adult [self-report from the guardian of youth], Parent [report about child]) and anxiety (STAI-C, STAI-A). Multivariate, univariate analyses of variance and hierarchical regression were used. ASD youth endorsed more Trait anxiety and response to specific stressors (e.g., virus). Caregivers of youth with ASD (Adults) self-reported higher anxiety, yet scores were elevated for both groups. Adults of youth with ASD reported more stress, especially related to the virus, access to healthcare, and concern for the future. In the TD group, youth and adults used more Primary and Secondary Control Coping whereas ASD youth and adults used more Disengagement Coping. Adult stress was the primary predictor of parent perception of child stress as well as Child self-reported stress. While the ASD group was consistently high compared to the TD group, there were no significant changes over time for stress or anxiety. Results reveal striking differences in youth with ASD and their parents regarding stress, anxiety, and coping. Findings highlight the need for essential support, access to services, and strategies to enhance psychological and emotional well-being. LAY SUMMARY: This study examined stress, anxiety, and coping related to the COVID-19 pandemic in 61 youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 61 youth with typical development (TD) and their parents. Results showed that ASD youth reported more anxiety and stress. Adults of youth with ASD indicated higher self-reported anxiety and stress than adults of TD youth. TD youth and their parents reported using more adaptive coping strategies. Findings highlight the need for strategies to enhance psychological and emotional well-being.","Corbett, Blythe A; Muscatello, Rachael A; Klemencic, Mark E; Schwartzman, Jessica M",Autism research (Online),,282

467365,Confined Students: A Visual-Emotional Analysis of Study and Rest Spaces in the Homes,2021,"Schizophrenia is a serious neurodevelopmental disorder. Genetics is an important factor leading to schizophrenia, but its exact role is still unclear. Many studies have focused on neurotransmitters and regulators that participate in the processes mediated by these neurotransmitters. Alcohol dehydrogenase may not only catalyze the oxidation of retinol and ethanol but also be involved in a variety of neurotransmitter metabolic pathways. Therefore, our study investigated whether ADH7 gene variations in the Chinese Han population were associated with schizophrenia. Genomic DNA was extracted from a cohort of 275 schizophrenic patients (136 men and 139 women) and 313 healthy controls (160 men and 153 women) from the Northern Han Chinese population. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test and linkage disequilibrium analysis were performed. Differences in genotypes, alleles, and haplotypes between the schizophrenic and control groups were determined using the chi-square test and correlation analysis. The distribution of the CC + TT genotype of rs284787 was statistically different between the case and control groups (p = 0.026, OR = 1.448); however, the difference disappeared after Bonferroni correction. Linkage analysis indicated that rs739147, rs284787, rs3805329, rs894369, rs3805331, and rs284786 were closely linked in one block. The haplotype analysis found no association between the composed haplotypes and the occurrence of schizophrenia. Our study showed that the ADH7 gene was not associated with the risk of schizophrenia. Additional studies with larger cohorts of different ethnicities are needed to validate our findings.","Zeng, Kuo; Li, Ya; Gao, Meng; Liu, Yong-Ping; Xu, Feng-Ling; Xia, Xi; Yao, Jun; Wang, Bao-Jie",J. mol. neurosci,,282

DESIGN: A rapid scoping review. SETTING: We searched the MEDLINE, Embase and grey literature sources for documents and press releases from governments and surgical organisations or associations. PARTICIPANTS: Studies examining surgical service delivery during public health emergencies including COVID-19, and the impact on patients, providers and healthcare systems were included. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were strategies implemented for the reorganisation of surgical services. Secondary were the impacts of reorganisation and resuming surgical services, such as: adverse events (including morbidity and mortality), primary care and emergency department visits, length of hospital and ICU stay, and changes to surgical waitlists. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-two studies were included in this review; 111 described reorganisation of surgical services, 55 described the consequences of reorganising surgical services; and 6 reported actions taken to rebuild surgical capacity in public health emergencies. Reorganisations of surgical services were grouped under six domains: case selection/triage, personal protective equipment (PPE) regulations and practice, workforce composition and deployment, outpatient and inpatient patient care, resident and fellow education, and the hospital or clinical environment. Service reorganisations led to large reductions in non-urgent surgical volumes, increases in surgical wait times and impacted medical training (ie, reduced case involvement) and patient outcomes (eg, increases in pain). Strategies for rebuilding surgical capacity were scarce but focused on the availability of staff, PPE and patient readiness for surgery as key factors to consider before resuming services. CONCLUSIONS: Reorganisation of surgical services in response to public health emergencies appears to be context dependent and has far-reaching consequences that must be better understood in order to optimise future health system responses to public health emergencies.","O039,; Rielly, Connor; Ng-Kamstra, Joshua; Kania-Richmond, Ania; Dort, Joseph; White, Jonathan; Robert, Jill; Brindle, Mary; Sauro, Khara",BMJ Open,,282

However, differentiation between spurious amplification and amplification of the target sequence is a challenge. Herein, we develop the use of molecular beacon (MB) probes for the sequence-specific detection of LAMP on commercially available lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) strips. The detection of three unique DNA sequences, including ORF1a from SARS-CoV-2, is demonstrated. In addition, the method is capable of detecting clinically relevant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (BRAF V600E). For all sequences tested, the LFIA method offers similar sensitivity to fluorescence detection using a qPCR instrument. We also demonstrate the coupling of the method with solid-phase microextraction to enable isolation and detection of the target sequences from human plasma, pond water, and artificial saliva. Lastly, a 3D printed device is designed and implemented to prevent contamination caused by opening the reaction containers after LAMP.","Varona, Marcelino; Eitzmann, Derek R; Anderson, Jared L",Anal Chem,,282

490985,Systematic Review of Clinical Insights into Novel Coronavirus (CoVID-19) Pandemic: Persisting Challenges in U.S. Rural Population,2020,"PURPOSE: Beginning in July of 2018, the FDA issued a voluntary recall regarding the presence of a contaminant found in the manufacturing of valsartan. What would ensue has become a largely unprecedented sequence of alarming events since the FDA began reporting public recalls, withdrawals and safety alerts on their website in 2016. Since then, the United States has been significantly impacted by drug recalls affecting angiotensin receptor blockers. This report arms clinicians with additional guidance and provides a framework for responding appropriately to future similar incidents and includes an overview of the angiotensin receptor blockers, and their effects and safety profiles. METHODS: This report includes a review of data from all pertinent clinical and scientific sources including information from the FDA's inspection documents and recall website. Additional information is provided on the specific bottles including all lot numbers, expiration dates, etc. RESULTS: The recalls/withdrawals are attributable to the presence of cancer-causing contaminants identified during the manufacturing process from drug manufacturers abroad. The root causes behind the recalls and subsequent shortage appear multifactorial, and stem to a certain extent from the outsourcing of medication manufacturing overseas and lack of quality checks and appropriate oversight. CONCLUSIONS: This inherent issue is not likely to resolve soon and has eroded the public trust of/in the healthcare system and the pharmaceutical industry. Patients and healthcare providers are significantly affected and should have a full understanding of the matter in order to guide appropriate response and actions.","Gillette, Michael; Taylor, Addison; Butulija, Djenita; Kadiyala, Himabindu; Jneid, Hani",Cardiovasc Drugs Ther,,282
491175,The Impact of Post-COVID-19 Syndrome on Self-Reported Physical Activity,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the seroprevalence and risk for SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers (HCWs) by job function and work location following the pandemic's first wave in New York City (NYC). METHODS: A cross-sectional study conducted between May 18 and June 26, 2020, during which HCWs at a large inner-city teaching hospital in NYC received voluntary antibody testing. The main outcome was presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies indicating previous infection. Seroprevalence and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for seropositivity by type and location of work were calculated using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of 2,749 HCWs tested, 831 tested positive, yielding a crude seroprevalence of 30.2% (95% CI, 29%-32%). Seroprevalence ranged from 11.1% for pharmacy staff to 44.0% for nonclinical HCWs comprised of patient transporters and housekeeping and security staff, with 37.5% for nurses and 20.9% for administrative staff. Compared to administrative staff, aORs (95% CIs) for seropositivity were 2.54 (1.64-3.94) for nurses; 2.51 (1.42-4.43) for nonclinical HCWs; between 1.70 and 1.83 for allied HCWs such as patient care technicians, social workers, registration clerks and therapists; and 0.80 (0.50-1.29) for physicians. Compared to office locations, aORs for the emergency department and inpatient units were 2.27 (1.53-3.37) and 1.48 (1.14-1.92), respectively. CONCLUSION: One-third of hospital-based HCWs were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 by the end of the first wave in NYC. Seroprevalence differed by job function and work location, with the highest estimated risk for nurses and the emergency department, respectively. These findings support current nationwide policy prioritizing HCWs for receipt of newly authorized COVID-19 vaccines.","Purswani, Murli U; Bucciarelli, Jessica; Tiburcio, Jose; Yagudayev, Shamuel M; Connell, Georgia H; Omidiran, Arafat A; Hannaway, Launcelot; Zeana, Cosmina; Healy, Maureen; Yu, Gary; Reich, Doug",J Hosp Med,,282

Within a short period of time, a large number of individual solutions were developed. The committee ""Simulated Persons"" of the Society for Medical Education has developed considerations and proposals in five areas to meet the qualitative challenges of the method. First and foremost, the safety of the SPs is at stake, both in terms of infection prevention and role-related stress to which the SPs are now exposed at home alone instead of the usual setting, where they are in a teaching building with the connection to the staff on site. Furthermore, it should be noted that the changed framework conditions also require a reflection on behalf of the learning objectives, since not all teaching scenarios with SPs can be transferred from a real setting to a digital environment. Furthermore, even under corona conditions, the constructive alignment must not be disregarded, i.e. the question of testability must be considered from the very beginning. Aspects of the technical infrastructure for all participants and compliance with data protection requirements must also be considered. Last but not least, the forced changes are also an opportunity to take a proactive approach to the topic of telemedicine in teaching.","Peters, Tim; Thrien, Christian",GMS J Med Educ,,282
500263,"Assessment of Preventative Measures Practice among Umrah Pilgrims in Saudi Arabia, 1440H-2019",2020,"Background: Healthcare services have responded to the challenges of service delivery during COVID-19 with telehealth and hybrid models of care. However, there is limited understanding of the experiences of care among people affected by cancer and how their experiences may change and evolve against the shifting landscape of COVID-19 incidence, mortality, vaccination and refinements in service delivery. Objectives: This study explores the experiences of cancer care among people affected by cancer in Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents the results of the initial cross-sectional semi-structured interviews and the longitudinal qualitative research design which will be employed in this study. Design: A longitudinal descriptive qualitative study. Setting: Ireland. Participants: People living with and after cancer or caring for someone with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Participants were recruited to the study via social media advertisements and consented to participate in up to three semi-structured interviews between January and July 2021. Initial semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 participants in January 2021. Participants completed measures of resilience (2-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale) and distress (The National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer). Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed thematically. Results: Participants reported low levels of distress and moderate to high levels of resilience on average. Three themes were generated from analysis of the first phase of cross-sectional interviews. Participants described a counterbalance of being cautious of infection and keeping safe through prevention and shielding strategies. Although hospitals felt safe and were working efficiently, some participants felt COVID-19 had compromised person-centredness and empathy in care. While participants valued the restrictions being taken to minimize infection risk, substitution of face-to-face appointments with telehealth services and attending essential face-to-face appointments alone restricted participants' access to professional and social support. Despite this, many participants felt public health measures to reduce transmission of COVID-19 had created a sense of not missing out, feeling safe and reduced difficult social interactions requiring explanation of their diagnosis. Conclusions: There is an opportunity to learn from the experiences of healthcare delivery from the perspectives of people affected by cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results highlight the complexities and dualities of living with, after or caring for someone with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Opportunities for longitudinal qualitative research to explore the evolving experiences, concerns and persistent and emerging unmet information and clinical needs within the rapidly changing socio-political, socio-cultural and healthcare contexts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highlighted.","Drury, Dr Amanda; Eicher, Professor Manuela; Dowling, Dr Maura",Int J Nurs Stud Adv,,282

500509,Examining the Determinants of Healthcare Workers' Performance: A Configurational Analysis during COVID-19 Times,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The initial surge of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic prompted national recommendations to delay nonurgent endoscopic procedures. The objective of this study was to provide real-world data on the impact of COVID-19 on endoscopic procedures in a safety-net healthcare system and cancer center affiliated with a tertiary academic center. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used a combination of electronic health record data and a prospective data tool created to track endoscopy procedures throughout COVID-19 to describe patient and procedural characteristics of endoscopic procedures delayed during the initial COVID-19 surge. RESULTS: Of the 480 patients identified, the median age was 57 years (interquartile range 46-66), 55% (n = 262) were male, and 59% self-identified as white. Colonoscopy was the most common type of delayed procedure (49%), followed by combined esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy (22%), and EGD alone (20%). Colorectal cancer screening was the most common indication for delayed colonoscopy (35%), and evaluation of suspected bleeding (30%) was the most common indication for delayed combined EGD and colonoscopy. To date, 46% (223/480) of delayed cases have been completed with 12 colorectal, pancreatic, and stomach cancers diagnosed. Sociodemographic factors, procedure type, and sedation type were not significantly associated with endoscopy completion. The median time to endoscopy after delayed procedure was 88 days (interquartile range 63-119) with no differences by procedure type. DISCUSSION: To minimize potential losses to follow-up, delayed, or missed diagnoses and to reduce progression of gastrointestinal diseases, all efforts should be used to ensure follow-up in those whose endoscopic procedures were delayed because of COVID-19.","Issaka, Rachel B; Feld, Lauren D; Kao, Jason; Hegarty, Erin; Snailer, Brandon; Kalra, Gorav; Tomizawa, Yutaka; Strate, Lisa",Clin Transl Gastroenterol,,282

We address this scenario by studying a variant of a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model on arbitrary network instances using an analytical framework based on the method of dynamic message passing. This framework provides a good estimate of the probabilistic evolution of the spread on both static and contact networks, offering a significantly improved accuracy with respect to individual-based mean-field approaches while requiring a much lower computational cost compared to numerical simulations. It facilitates the derivation of epidemic thresholds, which are phase boundaries separating parameter regimes where infections can be effectively contained from those where they cannot. These have clear implications on different containment strategies through topological (reducing contacts) and infection parameter changes (e.g., social distancing and wearing face masks), with relevance to the recent COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 American Physical Society.","Li, B.; Saad, D.",Physical Review E,,282

However, noise complaints reported by many local authorities were on the rise soon after the local lockdowns came into force. This research took Greater London in the UK as a case study. The overall aim was examining how noise complaints changed during the first stages of the lockdown implementation, during Spring 2020, both locally and at city scale, and how urban factors may have been influencing them. Noise complaint and urban factor datasets from the Government’s publicly available data warehouse were used. The results show that during the COVID-19 lockdown the number of noise complaints increased by 48%, compared with the same period during Spring 2019. In terms of noise sources, complaints about construction (36%) and neighbourhood (50%) noise showed significant increases. Urban factors, including housing and demographic factors, played a more significant role than the actual noise exposure to road and rail traffic noise, as derived from the London noise maps. In detail, the change rate of noise complaints is higher in areas with higher unemployment rates, more residents with no qualifications, and lower house price. It is expected that this study could help government with allocating resources more effectively and achieve a better urban environment.","Tong, Huan Aletta Francesco Mitchell Andrew Oberman Tin Kang Jian",Science of The Total Environment,,282

A Study from the Perspective of Population Migration,2021,"Methods for suppressing the host immune system over the long term and improving transplantation tolerance remain a primary issue in organ transplantation. Cell therapy is an emerging therapeutic strategy for immunomodulation after transplantation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult multipotent stem cells with wide differentiation potential and immunosuppressive properties, which are mostly used in regenerative medicine and immunomodulation. In addition, emerging research suggests that MSC-derived exosomes have the same therapeutic effects as MSCs in many diseases, while avoiding many of the risks associated with cell transplantation. Their unique immunomodulatory properties are particularly important in the immune system-overactive graft environment. In this paper, we review the effects of MSC-derived exosomes in the immune regulation mechanism after organ transplantation and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) from various perspectives, including immunosuppression, influencing factors, anti-inflammatory properties, mediation of tissue repair and regeneration, and the induction of immune tolerance. At present, the great potential of MSC-derived exosomes in immunotherapy has attracted a great deal of attention. Furthermore, we discuss the latest insights on MSC-derived exosomes in organ transplantation and GvHD, especially its commercial production concepts, which aim to provide new strategies for improving the prognosis of organ transplantation patients.","Zheng, Qingyuan; Zhang, Shuijun; Guo, Wen-Zhi; Li, Xiao-Kang",Front Immunol,,282

The latter has attracted attention as a viable alternative to disposable biosensors, also offering prospects for rapid screening of biomolecules or biomolecular interactions. In this context here, we developed an approach to successfully regenerate a fiber-optic (FO)-SPR surface when utilizing cobalt (II)-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) surface chemistry. To achieve this, we tested multiple regeneration conditions that can disrupt the NTA chelate on a surface fully saturated with His6-tagged antibody fragments (scFv-33H1F7) over ten regeneration cycles. The best surface regeneration was obtained when combining 100 mM EDTA, 500 mM imidazole and 0.5% SDS at pH 8.0 for 1 min with shaking at 150 rpm followed by washing with 0.5 M NaOH for 3 min. The true versatility of the established approach was proven by regenerating the NTA surface for ten cycles with three other model system bioreceptors, different in their size and structure: His6-tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike fragment (receptor binding domain, RBD), a red fluorescent protein (RFP) and protein origami carrying 4 RFPs (Tet12SN-RRRR). Enabling the removal of His6-tagged bioreceptors from NTA surfaces in a fast and cost-effective manner can have broad applications, spanning from the development of biosensors and various biopharmaceutical analyses to the synthesis of novel biomaterials.","Qu, Jia-Huan; Leirs, Karen; Escudero, Remei; Strmsek, Ziga; Jerala, Roman; Spasic, Dragana; Lammertyn, Jeroen",,,282

Study Protocol for a Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial,2021,"In Australia and beyond, journalism is reportedly an industry in crisis, a crisis exacerbated by COVID-19 However, the evidence revealing the crisis is often anecdotal or limited in scope In this unprecedented longitudinal research, we draw on data from the Australian journalism jobs market from January 2012 until March 2020 Using Data Science and Machine Learning techniques, we analyse two distinct data sets: job advertisements (ads) data comprising 3698 journalist job ads from a corpus of over 8?million Australian job ads;and official employment data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics Having matched and analysed both sources, we address both the demand for and supply of journalists in Australia over this critical period The data show that the crisis is real, but there are also surprises Counter-intuitively, the number of journalism job ads in Australia rose from 2012 until 2016, before falling into decline Less surprisingly, for the entire period studied the figures reveal extreme volatility, characterised by large and erratic fluctuations The data also clearly show that COVID-19 has significantly worsened the crisis We then tease out more granular findings, including: that there are now more women than men journalists in Australia, but that gender inequity is worsening, with women journalists getting younger and worse-paid just as men journalists are, on average, getting older and better-paid;that, despite the crisis besetting the industry, the demand for journalism skills has increased;and that, perhaps concerningly, the skills sought by journalism job ads increasingly include ?social media? and ?generalist communications? skills","Dawson, Nikolas Molitorisz Sacha Rizoiu Marian-Andrei Fray Peter",Journalism,,282
590169,Precautionary Behaviors during the Second and Third Phases of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Comparative Study in the Latin American Population,2021-06-26,"Background and Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between obesity and 28-day mortality, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of stay at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and hospital in patients admitted to the ICU for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective observational cohort study in patients admitted to the ICU for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, in a single Dutch center. The association between obesity (body mass index > 30 kg/m(2)) and 28-day mortality, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of ICU and hospital stay was investigated. Results: In 121 critically ill patients, pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by RT-PCR. Forty-eight patients had obesity (33.5%). The 28-day all-cause mortality was 28.1%. Patients with obesity had no significant difference in 28-day survival in Kaplan–Meier curves (log rank p 0.545) compared with patients without obesity. Obesity made no significant contribution in a multivariate Cox regression model for prediction of 28-day mortality (p = 0.124), but age and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were significant independent factors (p < 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). No statistically significant correlation was observed between obesity and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of ICU and hospital stay. Conclusion: One-third of the patients admitted to the ICU for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia had obesity. The present study showed no relationship between obesity and 28-day mortality, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay. Further studies are needed to substantiate these findings.","Pouwels, Sjaak; Ramnarain, Dharmanand; Aupers, Emily; Rutjes-Weurding, Laura; van Oers, Jos",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34210077/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57070674,282

A Randomized Clinical Trial,2021-04-06,"The Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions put in place to prevent or reduce the spread of the disease led to anxiety, concern and stress for many people. In England restrictions varied at different times of the year, and throughout this time there was a lot of attention focused on the importance of exercise and on engaging with nature to maintain wellbeing. We undertook an online survey that ran for six weeks in June/July 2020 and gained a response from 2115 people, of which 25% were male and 74% female, with 35% aged 16–44 and 65% aged 45+. This survey focused on people who were already interested or engaged with nature. We explored whether being physically activity changed or not, if being active impacted people’s wellbeing and whether those who were active benefited from connecting to nature. We found that those meeting the government recommended levels of physical activity in the previous week, of 150 min, were more likely to maintain their overall wellbeing through feeling that the things they did in their life were worthwhile (p < 0.0001) and reported an increase in feelings of connection to nature (p < 0.0001). While those who did less than 30 min of physical activity in the previous week were less happy (p < 0.0001) and more anxious than usual (p < 0.0001).

591143,The Mediating Role of Job Competence between Safety Participation and Behavioral Compliance,2021-05-27,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is a global pandemic. It has resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality around the world. The respiratory system is the main system invaded by the virus involved in COVID-19. In addition to typical respiratory manifestations, a certain proportion of severe COVID-19 cases present with evidence of myocardial injury, which is associated with excessive mortality. With availability of an increasing amount of imaging data, right ventricular (RV) damage is prevalent in patients with COVID-19 and myocardial injury, while left ventricular damage is relatively rare and lacks specificity. The mechanisms of RV damage may be due to increased RV afterload and decreased RV contractility caused by various factors, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary thrombosis, direct viral injury, hypoxia, inflammatory response and autoimmune injury. RV dysfunction usually indicates a poor clinical outcome in patients with COVID-19. Timely and effective treatment is of vital importance to save patients' lives as well as improve prognosis. By use of echocardiography or cardiovascular magnetic resonance, doctors can find RV dilatation and dysfunction early. By illustrating the phenomenon of RV damage and its potential pathophysiological mechanisms, we will guide doctors to give timely medical treatments (e.g., anticoagulants, diuretics, cardiotonic), and device-assisted therapy (e.g., mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) when necessary for these patients. In the paper, we examined the latest relevant studies to investigate the imaging features, potential mechanisms, and treatments of myocardial damage caused by COVID-19. RV damage may be an association between myocardial damage and lung injury in COVID-19. Early assessment of RV geometry and function will be helpful in aetiological determination and adjustment of treatment options.","Lan, Yonghao; Liu, Wei; Zhou, Yujie",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.606318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33665210/,282

METHODS: Single-center retrospective matched cohort analysis including 47 consecutive patients treated with intravenous tocilizumab for severe COVID-19 pneumonia (“TCZ group”), matched by age, comorbidities, time from symptoms onset and baseline SpO(2)/FiO(2) ratio with 47 patients receiving standard of care alone (“SoC group”). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the TCZ and SoC groups in the rate of clinical improvement (hospital discharge and/or a decrease of ≥2 points on a six-point ordinal scale) by day 7 (51.1% [24/47] versus 48.9% [23/47]; P-value = 1.000). No differences were observed at day 14 in terms of clinical improvement (72.3% versus 76.6%; P-value = 0.791), all-cause mortality (10.6% versus 12.8%; P-value = 1.000), and the composite of invasive mechanical ventilation and/or death (25.5% versus 23.4%; P-value = 1.000) either.

These limitations apply to both in vitro models such as cell-based cultures and in vivo animal models which invariably are limited to simulate the complexity of cardiovascular disease in humans. Implementing human heart tissue in cardiovascular research complements our research strategy using preclinical models. We established the Human Explanted Heart Program (HELP) which integrates clinical, tissue and molecular phenotyping thereby providing a comprehensive evaluation into human heart disease. Our collection and storage of biospecimens allow them to retain key pathogenic findings while providing novel insights into human heart failure. The use of human non-failing control explanted hearts provides a valuable comparison group for the diseased explanted hearts. Using HELP we have been able to create a tissue repository which have been used for genetic, molecular, cellular, and histological studies. This review describes the process of collection and use of explanted human heart specimens encompassing a spectrum of pediatric and adult heart diseases, while highlighting the role of these invaluable specimens in translational research. Furthermore, we highlight the efficient procurement and bio-preservation approaches ensuring analytical quality of heart specimens acquired in the context of heart donation and transplantation.","Zhang, Hao; Viveiros, Anissa; Nikhanj, Anish; Nguyen, Quynh; Wang, Kaiming; Wang, Wei; Freed, Darren H.; Mullen, John C.; MacArthur, Roderick; Kim, Daniel H.; Tymchak, Wayne; Sergi, Consolato M.; Kassiri, Zamaneh; Wang, Shaohua; Oudit, Gavin Y.",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443920303434?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2020.165995; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141063/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925443920303434,282

The objective of this study was to describe possible changes in substance use in the first months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe. METHODS: Data were obtained from a cross-sectional online survey of 36,538 adult substance users from 21 European countries conducted between April 24 and July 22 of 2020. Self-perceived changes in substance use were measured by asking respondents whether their use had decreased (slightly or substantially), increased (slightly or substantially), or not changed during the past month. The survey covered alcohol (frequency, quantity, and heavy episodic drinking occasions), tobacco, cannabis, and other illicit drug use. Sample weighted data were descriptively analysed and compared across substances. RESULTS: Across all countries, use of all substances remained unchanged for around half of the respondents, while the remainder reported either a decrease or increase in their substance use. For alcohol use, overall, a larger proportion of respondents indicated a decrease than those reporting an increase. In contrast, more respondents reported increases in their tobacco and cannabis use during the previous month compared to those reporting decreased use. No distinct direction of change was reported for other substance use. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest changes in use of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis during the initial months of the pandemic in several European countries. This study offers initial insights into changes in substance use. Other data sources, such as sales statistics, should be used to corroborate these preliminary findings.

Older age, male sex and certain underlying diseases, including cancer, appear to significantly increase the risk for severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection of host cells is facilitated by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), and by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and other host cell proteases such as cathepsin L (CTSL). With the exception of ACE-2, a systematic analysis of these two other SARS-CoV2 infection mediators in malignancies is lacking. Here, we analysed genetic alteration, RNA expression, and DNA methylation of TMPRSS2 and CTSL across a wide spectrum of tumors and controls. TMPRSS2 was overexpressed in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and uterine carcinosarcoma, with PRAD and READ exhibiting the highest expression of all cancers. CTSL was upregulated in lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, oesophageal carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lower grade glioma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, skin cutaneous melanoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and thymoma. Hypo-methylation of both genes was evident in most cases where they have been highly upregulated. We have expanded on our observations by including data relating to mutations and copy number alterations at pan-cancer level. The novel hypotheses that are stemming out of these data need to be further investigated and validated in large clinical studies.","Katopodis, Periklis; Anikin, Vladimir; Randeva, Harpal S.; Spandidos, Demetrios A.; Chatha, Kamaljit; Kyrou, Ioannis; Karteris, Emmanouil",Int J Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.2020.5071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32468052/,282

CT has been advocated in selected indications as a tool toward rapid and early diagnosis. The CT patterns of COVID-19 include ground glass opacities GGO, consolidation, and crazy paving. Additional signs include a “rounded morphology” of lesions, vascular enlargement sign, nodules, and fibrous stripe. Signs of healing and organization include subpleural bands, a reticular pattern, reversed halo sign and traction bronchiectasis. Cavitation and tree in bud signs are absent and pleural effusions are rare. There is a high incidence of pulmonary embolism associated with COVID-19. CT findings in COVID-19 appear to follow a predictable timeline with maximal involvement approximately 6–11 days after symptom onset. The stages of evolution include early stage (days 0–4) with GGO being the predominant abnormality, progressive stage (days 5–8) with increasing crazy paving; and peak stage (days 9–13) with predominance of consolidation and absorption phase (after day 14) with gradual absorption of consolidation with residual GGO and subpleural bands. CT findings in COVID-19 have a high sensitivity and low specificity, determined to be 98% and 25% in a retrospective study of 1014 patients. The low specificity of CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia is due to the overlap of CT findings with other viral pneumonias and other infections, lung involvement in connective tissue disorders, drug reaction, pulmonary edema, and hemorrhage.","Malguria, Nagina; Yen, Li-Hsiang; Lin, Tony; Hussein, Amira; Fishman, Elliot K.",J Clin Imaging Sci,https://doi.org/10.25259/jcis_138_2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34221639/,282

In this commentary, we discuss two essential changes that Homeless Health Care Los Angeles (HHCLA) made to modify existing medication for addiction treatment (MAT) services to address the specific treatment needs of this high-risk population during COVID-19. First, HHCLA implemented a novel “telephone booth” model that allowed socially distanced on-site “face-to-face” treatment of syringe exchange patients; this model helped us to overcome the inherent challenges of using traditional telemedicine approaches (e.g., video, mobile telephone) with this disadvantaged patient population. Second, HHCLA transitioned from on-site direct dispensing of MAT medications in our providers’ offices to a less contact- and time-intensive “coordinated pharmacy” model that allowed patients the freedom to obtain MAT medications off-site from participating pharmacies. Our data indicate that implementing these COVID-19-related changes effectively maintained patient enrollment and engagement in MAT—illuminating new, potentially effective models for delivering MAT that meet the critical health and safety needs of syringe exchange patients following COVID-19.","Tringale, Rolando; Subica, Andrew M.",J Subst Abuse Treat,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108181; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740547220304384?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33129635/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0740547220304384,282

A shift from this condition to a tumor-suppressive microenvironment is of significant benefit to susceptible individuals. The carbonyl groups of glycine and valine have long bond lengths, consequently generating potent affinities to divalent cations such as calcium. We hypothesize that the formation of insoluble and rigid calcium oxalate augmented by glycine and valine counteracts strong acids such as HCl chemically, thus reducing cancer risks. The anticancer effects of the 2 amino acids can be explained from a chemical and biochemical perspective.

Research on CF infection has highlighted differences from other respiratory infections—both in the range and the nature of the organisms—especially in chronic infection. This is a rapidly advancing field of microbiology and is bringing insights into the complexity and adaptations of bacteria causing chronic infection in the respiratory tract. AREAS OF AGREEMENT AND CONTROVERSY: The epidemiology of some infections in CF has changed, with reduction in spread of Burkholderia cenocepacia following patient segregation. Conversely, epidemic strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have emerged, which spread between patients; previously, most P. aeruginosa strains were patient-specific. Studies on hypermutators, quorum sensing, biofilm growth and the development of molecular identification have shed light on pathogenicity, microbial adaptation to the host and complexity of infection in CF. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria are emerging pathogens in CF; however, there is much to learn about pathogenicity and treatment of these infections. Species of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, more commonly encountered in the upper tract, are found in significant numbers in CF sputum. The significance of this is however under debate. Finally, although the clinical relevance of conventional antibiotic susceptibility testing for chronic CF pathogens has been questioned, there are no clear alternatives. EMERGING AREAS FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Much has been learnt about pathogenicity, evolution of CF pathogens and development of antibiotic resistance. The need is to focus on clinical relevance of these observations to improve diagnosis, prevention and treatment of CF infection.","Foweraker, Juliet",Br Med Bull,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19155262/; https://doi.org/10.1093/bmb/ldn050,282

We explore heterogeneity in trajectories of psychological distress during the pandemic in the United Kingdom and relate this heterogeneity to socio-demographic and health factors. We analyze nine waves of longitudinal, nationally representative survey data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study ([Formula: see text] ), covering the period from early 2020 to mid-2021. First, latent class mixture modelling is used to identify trajectories of psychological distress. Second, associations of the trajectories with covariates are tested with multinomial logistic regressions. We find four different trajectories of distress: continuously low, temporarily elevated, repeatedly elevated, and continuously elevated distress. Nearly two fifths of the population experienced severely elevated risks of distress during the pandemic. Long-term distress was highest among younger people, women, people living without a partner, those who had no work or lost income, and those with previous health conditions or COVID-19 symptoms.

Although multiple risk factors for COVID-19 have been identified, using this data to improve clinical care has proven challenging. The main aim of this study is to develop a reliable, multivariable predictive model for COVID-19 in-patient outcomes, thus enabling risk-stratification and earlier clinical decision-making. Methods: Anonymised data consisting of 44 independent predictor variables from 355 adults diagnosed with COVID-19, at a UK hospital, was manually extracted from electronic patient records for retrospective, case–control analysis. Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality, required ventilatory support, and duration of inpatient treatment. Pulmonary embolism sequala was the only secondary outcome. After balancing data, key variables were feature selected for each outcome using random forests. Predictive models were then learned and constructed using Bayesian networks. Results: The proposed probabilistic models were able to predict, using feature selected risk factors, the probability of the mentioned outcomes. Overall, our findings demonstrate reliable, multivariable, quantitative predictive models for four outcomes, which utilise readily available clinical information for COVID-19 adult inpatients.

The approach addresses conceptual, epistemological, and social domains of knowledge, and places emphasis on the epistemological conversations about data acquisitions and transformations in the sciences. The steps of data transformation, which we refer to as data-texts, we argue, unfold the processes of using evidence during knowledge building and reveal the dynamics of scientific practices. Data-texts involve (a) obtaining observations/measurements to become data; (b) selecting and interpreting data to become evidence; (c) using evidence to ascertain patterns and develop models; and (d) utilizing the patterns and models to propose and refine explanations. Throughout the transformations of the EE continuum, there are stages of transition that foster the engagement of learners in negotiations of meaning and collective construction of knowledge. A focus on the EE continuum facilitates the emergence of further insights, both by questioning the nature of the data and its multiple possibilities for change and representations and by reflecting on the nature of the explanations. The shift of emphasis to the epistemics of science holds implications for the design of learning environments that support learners in developing contemporary understandings of the nature and processes of scientific practices.","Duschl, Richard; Avraamidou, Lucy; Azevedo, Nathália Helena",Sci Educ (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s11191-021-00225-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33942000/,282
596398,The Relationship between Emotional Intelligence and Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy of Chinese Vocational College Students,2020-06-23,"There are many reasons to keep research mice healthy and free from infections. The two most important of these are to protect the health and welfare of research mice and to prevent infections from negatively impacting research. Just as the genetic integrity of a mouse strain will influence the reproducibility and validity of research data, so too will the microbiologic integrity of the animals. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in the literature of laboratory animal sciences wherein the direct impact of infections on physiologic parameters under study have been described. Therefore, it is of great importance that scientists pay close attention to the health status of their research animal colonies and maintain good communications with the animal facility personnel at their institution about mouse health issues. This overview provides information about animal health monitoring (HM) in research mouse colonies including commonly monitored agents, diagnostic methods, HM program, risk assessment, and animal facility biosecurity. Lastly, matters of communication with laboratory animal professionals at research institutions are also addressed. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Fahey, James R.; Olekszak, Haiyan",Curr Protoc Mouse Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26331758/; https://doi.org/10.1002/9780470942390.mo150023,282

Teams working in these emergency services experience a heavy workload and have a limited amount of time with each patient. COVID-19 has further complicated these existing issues. Therefore, we believed it would be helpful to draft an abridged version of the 40-item WCSHES, considering both validity and reliability criteria, but giving greater weight to validity. One hundred and twenty-six workers between the ages of 20 to 64 (M = 32.45; standard deviation (SD = 9.73)) years old participated voluntarily in the study. The validity, reliability, and fit model were evaluated in an iterative process.

In attempts to discover an urgent treatment regime for COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) have been on solidarity clinical trial. However, many countries have pulled HCQ and CQ from their COVID-19 treatment regimens recently, some countries still continue using them for patients who have previously started HCQ and CQ and they may complete their course under the supervision of a doctor. HCQ and CQ are 4-aminoquinoline drugs and it is safe to use them for autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and malaria as well. Determination of CQ, HCQ and their metabolites in biologic fluids and in pharmaceuticals has great importance, especially for pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and epidemiological studies. In this review, liquid chromatographic methods developed in the last 10 years were summarized focusing on sample preparation and detection methods for HCQ and CQ determination in biological fluids and pharmaceutical preparations. It is hoped that this article could be helpful to facilitate the use of these drugs in clinical trials or drug research studies as it provides comprehensive information on the reported analytical methods.","Bilgin, Zeynep Derya; Evcil, Isil; Yazgi, Didem; Binay, Gokce; Okuyucu Genc, Ceren; Gulsen, Busra; Huseynova, Aytaj; Ozdemir, Ayse Zehra; Ozmen, Emel; Usta, Yakup; Ustun, Suade; Caglar Andac, Sena",J Chromatogr Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33336246/; https://doi.org/10.1093/chromsci/bmaa110,282

We aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emotional and cognitive responses and behavioral coping among Chinese residents. Methods: An online investigation was run from 5 February to 25 February 2020, which recruited a total of 616 Chinese residents. Self-designed questionnaires were used to collect demographic information, epidemic knowledge and prevention of COVID-19 and characteristics of medical workers. The emotional and cognitive responses were assessed via the Symptom Check List-30 (SCL-30) and Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Behavioral coping was assessed via Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). Results: In total, 131 (21.3%) medical workers and 485 (78.7%) members of the general public completed the structured online survey. The structural equation models showed that emotional response interacted with cognitive response, and both emotional response and cognitive response affected the behavioral coping. Multivariate regression showed that positive coping enhanced emotional and cognitive responses, while negative coping reduced emotional and cognitive responses. The emotional response (depression, anxiety and photic anxiety) scores of the participants were higher than the norm (all p < 0.001); in particular, the panic scores of members of the general public were higher than those of medical workers (p < 0.05), as well as the cognitive response (paranoia and compulsion). Both positive and negative coping scores of the participants were lower than the norm (p < 0.001), and the general public had higher negative coping than medical workers (p < 0.05). Conclusion: During the preliminary stage of COVID-19, our study confirmed the significance of emotional and cognitive responses, which were associated with behavioral coping and significantly influenced the medical workers and the general public’s cognition and level of public health emergency preparedness. These results emphasize the importance of psychological health at times of widespread crisis.","Cai, Zemin; Zheng, Shukai; Huang, Yanhong; Zhang, Xuanzhi; Qiu, Zhaolong; Huang, Anyan; Wu, Kusheng",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32859064/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176198,282

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, which are one of the most polymorphic genes, play a pivotal role in both resistance and vulnerability of the body against viruses and other infections as well as chronic diseases. The association between HLA alleles and preexisting medical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus is reported in various studies. In this review, we focused on the bioinformatic HLA studies to summarize the HLA alleles which responded to SARS-CoV-2 peptides and have been used to design vaccines. We also reviewed HLA alleles that are associated with comorbidities and might be related to the high mortality rate among COVID-19 patients. Since both genes and patients' medical conditions play a key role in both severity of the disease and the mortality rate in COVID-19 patients, a better understanding of the connection between HLA alleles and SARS-CoV-2 can provide a wider perspective on the behavior of the virus. Such understanding can help scientists, especially in terms of protecting healthcare workers and designing effective vaccines.","Mobini Kesheh, Mina; Shavandi, Sara; Hosseini, Parastoo; Kakavand-Ghalehnoei, Rezvan; Keyvani, Hossein",Biomed Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6693909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34136572/,282

This approach is also recommended in the applicable Dutch guideline; however, translating guidelines into practical strategies is often difficult in nursing homes. Nevertheless, a better understanding of guideline implementation is key to improving the quality of care. Here we describe and qualitatively evaluate the implementation process of the multidisciplinary guideline ‘Recognition and treatment of chronic pain in vulnerable elderly’ in a Dutch nursing home. The researchers used interviews and document analyses to study the nursing home’s implementation of the guideline. The project team of the nursing home first filled out an implementation matrix to formulate goals based on preferred knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors for the defined target groups. Together with experts and organizations, pharmacotherapy audit meetings were organized, an expert pain team was appointed, a policy document and policy flowchart were prepared, and ‘anchor personnel’ were assigned to disseminate knowledge amongst professionals. Implementation was partially successful and resulted in a functioning pain team, a pain policy, the selection of preferred measurement instruments, and pain becoming a fixed topic during multidisciplinary meetings. Nevertheless, relatively few professionals were aware of the implementation process.","van den Akker, Lizanne E.; de Waal, Margot W. M.; Geels, Paul J. E.

Associations between substance use, venous thromboembolism (VTE) or peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and its effects on LOS or mortality in patients with HF hospitalised with COVID-19 remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study identified risk factors associated with poor in-hospital outcomes among patients with HF hospitalised with COVID-19. METHODS: Case–control study was conducted of patients with prior diagnosis of HF hospitalised with COVID-19 at an academic tertiary care centre from 1 January 2020 to 28 February 2021. Patients with HF hospitalised with COVID-19 with risk factors were compared with those without risk factors for clinical characteristics, LOS and mortality. Multivariate regression was conducted to identify multiple predictors of increased LOS and in-hospital mortality in patients with HF hospitalised with COVID-19. RESULTS: Total of 211 patients with HF were hospitalised with COVID-19. Women had longer LOS than men (9 days vs 7 days; p<0.001). Compared with patients without PAD or ischaemic stroke, patients with PAD or ischaemic stroke had longer LOS (7 days vs 9 days; p=0.012 and 7 days vs 11 days, p<0.001, respectively). Older patients (aged 65 and above) had increased in-hospital mortality compared with younger patients (adjusted OR: 1.04; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.07; p=0.036). Prior diagnosis of VTE increased mortality more than threefold in patients with HF hospitalised with COVID-19 (adjusted OR: 3.33; 95% CI 1.29 to 8.43; p=0.011).

598163,"Relation among Perceived Weight Change, Sedentary Activities and Sleep Quality during COVID-19 Lockdown: A Study in an Academic Community in Northern Italy",2021-03-13,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive therapies are developed on the principle that specific cognitive appraisals are key determinants in the development and maintenance of mental health disorders. It is likely that particular appraisals of the coronavirus pandemic will have explanatory power for subsequent mental health outcomes in the general public. To enable testing of this hypothesis we developed a questionnaire assessing coronavirus-related cognitions. METHODS: 12 285 participants completed online a 46-item pool of cognitions about coronavirus and six measures of different mental health problems. The sample was randomly split into derivation and validation samples. Exploratory factor analyses determined the factor structure, selection of items, and model fit in the derivation sample. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) then tested this model in the validation sample. Associations of the questionnaire with mental health outcomes were examined. RESULTS: The 26-item, seven-factor, Oxford Psychological Investigation of Coronavirus Questionnaire [TOPIC-Q] was developed. CFA demonstrated a good model fit (χ(2) = 2108.43, df = 278, p < 0.001, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.950, Tucker−Lewis index (TLI) = 0.942, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.033, standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = 0.038). The factors were: cognitions about (1) safety and vulnerability, (2) negative long-term impact, (3) having the virus, (4) spreading the virus, (5) social judgment, (6) negative self, and (7) being targeted. The questionnaire explained significant variance in depression (45.8%), social anxiety (37.3%), agoraphobia (23.2%), paranoia (27.3%), post-traumatic stress disorder (57.1%), and panic disorder (31.4%). Cognitions about negative long-term impact had the greatest explanatory power across disorders.

598759,A Pilot Evaluation of mHealth App Accessibility for Three Top-Rated Weight Management Apps by People with Disabilities,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious and complex physical illness that affects all body systems with a multiplicity of symptoms, but key hallmarks of the disease are pervasive fatigue and ‘post-exertional malaise’, exacerbation after physical and/or mental activity of the intrinsic fatigue and other symptoms that can be highly debilitating and last from days to months. Although the disease can vary widely between individuals, common symptoms also include pain, cognitive deficits, sleep dysfunction, as well as immune, neurological and autonomic symptoms. Typically, it is a very isolating illness socially, carrying a stigma because of the lack of understanding of the cause and pathophysiology. METHODS: To gain insight into the pathophysiology of ME/CFS, we examined the proteomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by SWATH-MS analysis in a small well-characterised group of patients and matched controls. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to stratify groups based on protein abundance patterns, which clearly segregated the majority of the ME/CFS patients (9/11) from the controls. This majority subgroup of ME/CFS patients was then further compared to the control group. RESULTS: A total of 60 proteins in the ME/CFS patients were differentially expressed (P < 0.01, Log(10) (Fold Change) > 0.2 and < −0.2). Comparison of the PCA selected subgroup of ME/CFS patients (9/11) with controls increased the number of proteins differentially expressed to 99. Of particular relevance to the core symptoms of fatigue and post-exertional malaise experienced in ME/CFS, a proportion of the identified proteins in the ME/CFS groups were involved in mitochondrial function, oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport chain complexes, and redox regulation. A significant number were also involved in previously implicated disturbances in ME/CFS, such as the immune inflammatory response, DNA methylation, apoptosis and proteasome activation. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study support a model of deficient ATP production in ME/CFS, compensated for by upregulation of immediate pathways upstream of Complex V that would suggest an elevation of oxidative stress. This study and others have found evidence of a distinct pathology in ME/CFS that holds promise for developing diagnostic biomarkers.","Sweetman, Eiren; Kleffmann, Torsten; Edgar, Christina; de Lange, Michel; Vallings, Rosamund; Tate, Warren",J Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32972442/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02533-3,282

METHODS: All patients, who were referred to a tertiary-university hospital respiratory triage (March 27–April 26, 2020), were highly clinically suggestive for COVID-19 and had undergone a chest CT scan were included. Those with positive rRT-PCR or highly clinically suspicious patients with typical chest CT scan pulmonary manifestations were considered confirmed COVID-19 for additional analyses. Patients, based on outcome, were categorized into outpatient, ordinary-ward admitted, intensive care unit (ICU) admitted, and deceased; their demographic, clinical, and chest CT scan parameters were compared. The pulmonary chest CT scan features were scaled with a novel semi-quantitative scoring system to assess pulmonary involvement (PI). RESULTS: Chest CT scans of 739 patients (mean age = 49.2 ± 17.2 years old, 56.7% male) were reviewed; 491 (66.4%), 176 (23.8%), and 72 (9.7%) cases were managed outpatient, in an ordinary ward, and ICU, respectively. A total of 439 (59.6%) patients were confirmed COVID-19 cases; their most prevalent chest CT scan features were ground-glass opacity (GGO) (93.3%), pleural-based peripheral distribution (60.3%), and multi-lobar (79.7%), bilateral (76.6%), and lower lobes (RLL and/or LLL) (89.1%) involvement. Patients with lower SpO(2), advanced age, RR, total PI score or PI density score, and diffuse distribution or involvement of multi-lobar, bilateral, or lower lobes were more likely to be ICU admitted/expired. After adjusting for confounders, predictive models found cutoffs of age ≥ 53, SpO(2) ≤ 91, and PI score ≥ 8 (15) for ICU admission (death). A combination of all three factors showed 89.1% and 95% specificity and 81.9% and 91.4% accuracy for ICU admission and death outcomes, respectively. Solely evaluated high PI score had high sensitivity, specificity, and NPV in predicting the outcome as well. CONCLUSION: We strongly recommend patients with age ≥ 53, SpO(2) ≤ 91, and PI score ≥ 8 or even only high PI score to be considered as high-risk patients for further managements and care plans. KEY POINTS: • Chest CT scan is a valuable tool in prioritizing the patients in hospital triage. • A more accurate and novel 35-scale semi-quantitative scoring system was designed to predict the COVID-19 patients’ outcome. • Patients with age ≥ 53, SpO(2) ≤ 91, and PI score ≥ 8 or even only high PI score should be considered high-risk patients.","Salahshour, Faeze; Mehrabinejad, Mohammad-Mehdi; Nassiri Toosi, Mohssen; Gity, Masoumeh; Ghanaati, Hossein; Shakiba, Madjid; Nosrat Sheybani, Sina; Komaki, Hamidreza; Kolahi, Shahriar",Eur Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07623-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33449185/,282

Evidence of blended teaching’s effect on the academic performance of undergraduate physiotherapy students’ performance is scarce. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to determine students’ theoretical and clinical performance in a blended teaching module compared to their own performance in two knowledge areas taught face to face, and student perceptions of blended teaching in the third-year physiotherapy curriculum. METHODS: The cross-sectional study design included 47 third-year physiotherapy students. The orthopaedic module was delivered using a blended teaching approach in two consecutive semesters, whilst two other physiotherapy knowledge areas, neuromusculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary, in the same semesters were delivered face to face. Theoretical and clinical performances of students were compared for significance and effect. Students were assessed on their theoretical and clinical knowledge in all areas using the same assessment methods. The students (n = 43) also completed a survey on their blended teaching experience. RESULTS: Significantly higher theoretical marks for orthopaedics were calculated compared to neuromusculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary for both semesters with a large positive effect (average Cohen d = 4.44) for blended teaching on theoretical examination performance; no statistically significant difference for clinical performances. Students felt engaged in the blended teaching process, and 72% preferred blended teaching over face-to-face teaching or online delivery. CONCLUSION: Blended teaching improved the theoretical marks, demonstrating that knowledge acquisition was improved, but not clinical performance.

600258,Influence of Population Density for COVID-19 Spread in Malaysia: An Ecological Study,2021-09-18,"Background Heart failure (HF) is a costly, progressive, symptomatic, and deadly condition affecting more than 6 million people in the United States. Despite evidence that advance care planning (ACP), including completion of an advance directive (AD), enhances decision-making quality and patient experience, completion rates remain low. ACP decision aids have been shown to improve the quality of decisions in other chronic illnesses, yet few have been tested in the HF population. Purpose This pilot study was designed to test the feasibility and acceptability of an Advance Directive Decision Aid (ADDA) in hospitalized patients with HF and their designated caregivers. The secondary aim was to describe the levels of decisional conflict (DC) and decisional regret (DR) associated with participating in ACP discussions and consideration of completing an AD. Methods Convenience sampling was used to recruit 30 dyads (patients with HF and their designated caregivers) from an academic medical center. Feasibility was assessed by tracking the enrolled, ineligible, and refusal rates, in addition to the time to deliver the intervention. Acceptability was assessed via completion of a follow-up survey and participation in an exit interview. The dyads were evaluated for DC and DR following delivery of the ADDA. Results For enrolled patients, mean age was 56.5 years (SD = 12.17), 73% were Caucasian, most were male (66.6%), 54% were diagnosed with HF <1 year, and 70% were NYHA IV. Patients that were ineligible or refused participation were similar in sociodemographic data to the enrolled sample, though the refusal sample was significantly younger (56.5 years vs 49.47 years; p = 0.011). The ADDA took 2-5 minutes to complete. 80% of dyads found the ADDA to be acceptable and would recommend the ADDA to others. Dyads also reported that the ADDA assisted decision making to complete an AD. Dyads expressed similar amounts of DC; however, caregivers were found to have significantly more DR compared to patients (p = 0.008). In qualitative analysis, both patients and caregivers reported decreased anxiety and gratitude about ACP discussions. Enrolled patients expressed a sense of relief in participating in ACP discussions, though continued to endorse a sense of “impending death” if they completed an AD. Only 8 of 30 patients completed an AD at the conclusion of the study. Conclusions This pilot study revealed that the ADDA was feasible in clinical practice and acceptable to patients and caregivers.

DESIGN: Retrospective consecutive case series. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and ninety eyes of 188 patients with primary, rhegmatogenous RD. METHODS: Patients with RD who presented over a 1-year period (September 14, 2019 to September 13, 2020). The relationship between demographic, anatomic, and visual acuity parameters were compared before and after onset of the pandemic using generalized estimating equations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Macular status and corrected distance visual acuity on presentation. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-seven eyes, divided into 2 cohorts: pre-COVID (n = 100 September 14, 2019 to March 13, 2020) and post-COVID (n = 87, March 14, 2020 to September 13, 2020). Of the eyes, 63.2% (n = 87) presented with macular detachment in the post-COVID group compared with 45% (n = 100) in the pre-COVID group (odds ration [OR], 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.19–3.86; p = 0.011). As well, eyes in the pre-pandemic cohort had significantly fewer detached quadrants on initial examination (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30–0.93; p = 0.026). Patients in the post-COVID group had a significantly worse corrected distance visual acuity at baseline (mean difference [MD] = –0.35 logMAR, 95% CI, –0.60 to –0.09; p = 0.008), but not at 1 month or at final follow-up. No differences were seen between groups with respect to demographics, lens status, treatment, time to presentation, or chronicity. Pneumatic retinopexy was the most commonly performed procedure in both cohorts, with a 71.5% success rate. CONCLUSIONS: Closures after the COVID-19 pandemic affected the characteristics of RDs at presentation with respect to macular detachment, extent of RD, and presenting visual acuity. At final follow-up, final visual acuity and anatomic outcomes were similar between the 2 groups. These data are helpful for future patient education, triaging, and treatment decision making.","Arjmand, Parnian; Murtaza, Fahmeeda; Eshtiaghi, Arshia; Popovic, Marko M.; Kertes, Peter J.; Eng, Kenneth T.",Can J Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33444561/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008418220308425; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjo.2020.12.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0008418220308425,282

600861,Survey on Public Psychological Intervention Demand and Influence Factors Analysis,2021-04-30,"INTRODUCTION: Systematic inflammatory response occurred in some critically ill patients with COVID-19. Cytokine reduction by hemadsorption is a mechanism of treatment. However, whether CytoSorb hemoperfusion works for critically ill COVID-19 patients remains unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We observed case series of critically ill COVID-19 patients receiving CytoSorb hemoperfusion as rescue therapy from 3 hospitals in Hubei, China from February 28, 2020, to April 7, 2020. Their demographic, laboratory, and clinical data were collected. The parameters for organ function and IL-6 levels were compared before and after treatments. RESULTS: A total of 10 cases were included. The median age of the patients was 67.7 years (range = 50–85) with APACHE II (23.5) and SOFA (11.4). Patients received a median of 3 attempts of hemoperfusion (range = 1–6). The median CytoSorb perfusion time was 47 h (12–92 h). The level of IL-6 significantly decreased after treatments (712.6 [145–5,000] vs. 136.7 [46.3–1,054] pg/mL, p = 0.005). Significant improvement was found in PaO2/FiO2 (118 [81–220] vs. 163 [41–340] mm Hg, p = 0.04) and lactate levels (2.5 [1–18] vs. 1.7 [1.1–10] mmol/L, p = 0.009). The hemodynamics measured by norepinephrine/MAP slightly improved after treatment (17 [0–68] vs. 8 [0–39], p = 0.09). Albumin mildly decreased after CytoSorb. No significant changes were found in red blood cell counts, white cell counts, and platelets. CONCLUSION: Treatment with CytoSorb in critically ill COVID-19 patients was associated with decreased IL-6 improvement in oxygenation. However, these effects cannot be confirmed as the direct effects of CytoSorb owing to lack of controls. Establishing causality requires large-scale randomized clinical trials.","Peng, Jin-Yu; Li, Lu; Zhao, Xu; Ding, Feng; Hou, Xiaotong; Peng, Zhiyong",Blood Purif,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407530/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000517721,282

We analysed severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolates data using the multifractal approach and found a rich in viral genome diversity, which could be one of the root causes of the fast Covid-19 pandemic and is strongly affected by pressure and health index of the hosts inhabited regions. The calculated mutation rate (m(r)) is observed to be maximum at a particular pressure, beyond which m(r) maintains diversity. Hurst exponent and fractal dimension are found to be optimal at a critical pressure (Pm), whereas, for P > Pm and P < Pm, we found rich genome diversity relating to complicated genome organisation and virulence of the virus. The values of these complexity measurement parameters are found to be increased linearly with health index values.","Singh, R. K. Sanayaima; Malik, Md. Zubbair; Singh, R. K.

We demonstrate this using data for of top-20 affected countries, separately in terms of most cases and most deaths reporting countries. The results reveal that the model that incorporates health-news index outperforms the benchmark historical average model, indicating the significance of health news searches as a good predictor of stock returns since the emergence of the pandemic. We also find that accounting for “asymmetry” effect, adjusting for macroeconomic factors and incorporating financial news improves the forecast performance. These results are consistently robust to data sample, both in the in-sample and out-of-sample forecast periods, outliers and heterogeneity.","Salisu, Afees A.; Vo, Xuan Vinh",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521920301903?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1057521920301903,282

COVID-19 has been associated with a number of cardiovascular involvements, including ventricular functions. The aim of our study was to evaluate the right ventricular functions of mild severity COVID-19 patients 3 months after, and compare them to the right ventricular functions of healthy volunteers. For this single-center study, data from 105 patients who were treated for mild severity COVID-19 between September 15, 2020 and December 31, 2020 were collected. 105 age and sex matched healthy subjects were included in the study. Right ventricular (RV) functions were evaluated using conventional two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography and 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) for all patients. 2D-E parameters indicating RV functions were compared between the two groups. RV diamaters, systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) and RV myocardial performance index (RV MPI) were significantly higher in the COVID-19 patients compared to control group (p < 0.05). Tricuspid annular plane systolic motion (TAPSE), right ventricular fractional area change (RVFAC) and RV S’ were significantly lower in the COVID-19 group compared to control group (p < 0.05). RV global longitudinal strain (RV-GLS) (− 19.6 ± 5.2 vs. − 15.1 ± 3.4, p < 0.001) and RV free wall longitudinal strain RV-FWLS (− 19.6 ± 5.2 vs. − 17.2 ± 4.4, p < 0.001) values were significantly lower in the COVID-19 group than the control group. There was a significant negative correlation between RV-FWLS, RV-GLS and C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), d-dimer, ferritin, platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in patients with mild severity COVID-19. This results suggested that RV-GLS and RV-FWLS decreased in the long term (third month) follow-up of patients treated for mild severity COVID-19 disease. Subclinical RV dysfunction may be observed in patients after mild severity COVID-19.","Akkaya, Fatih; Yenerçağ, Feyza Nur Topçu; Kaya, Ahmet; Şener, Yusuf Ziya; Bağcı, Ali",Int J Cardiovasc Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34251551/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10554-021-02340-x,282

Focusing on a traditionally rational insurance customer offering a value that explores the customer’s emotions, from co-creating with the user, allows brand differentiation. Given this idea, this document has three purposes. First is identify the true role of expectations and the perceived quality of the customer’s digital experience. Second is to identify the relationship between customer experience and satisfaction gained in private insurance web areas. Third is to identify the most valued digital attributes by the user. A sample of 4,178 customers registered was analyzed using the partial least-squares technique. The model is highly predictive to customer experience and evidence the important relationship between the WOW effect and satisfaction, as well as the weak but double role that expectations play on insurance digital self-service. The model demonstrates that expectations are only relevant before web consumption, because during the process it is the perceived digital quality, in particular the usefulness, information, and technology, that offers a true customer experience. This article offers high academic value because it more accurately defines the determinants of the digital insurance customer experience and its effect on customer satisfaction in digital services. While expectations influence attitude before service, this research reveals that perceived digital quality is what delivers a true customer experience. Strategically, the implications are immediate in the field of business as it shows the importance of co-creation in digital design, not only because of the significant savings in implementation costs but also because it guarantees a greater experience, essential in the loyalty of its customers. This ensures the sustainable growth of the company.","Méndez-Aparicio, M.

602684,The Potential Role of School Citizen Science Programs in Infectious Disease Surveillance: A Critical Review,2021-06-30,"Although the efficacies of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, i.e., the virus that causes Covid-19, have been publicized and praised, and although they are assumed to encourage vaccine compliance, little is known about how well these figures are understood by the general public. Our study aims to fill this gap by investigating whether laypeople have an adequate grasp of what vaccine efficacy means and, if not, which misconceptions and consequences are the most common. To this end, we carried out three online behavioral experiments involving 1800 participants overall. The first, exploratory experiment, with a sample of 600 UK participants, allowed us to document by means of both an open-ended question and a multiple-choice question, a common misinterpretation of the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as the non-incidence rate among the vaccinated. We formally demonstrated that this error leads to a systematic overestimation of the probability of individuals who are vaccinated developing Covid-19. The second experiment confirmed the prevalence of this misinterpretation in a new sample of 600 UK and Italian participants, by means of a slightly different multiple-choice question that included more response options. Finally, in a third experiment, involving another 600 UK and Italian participants, we investigated the behavioral implications of the documented error and showed that it might undermine the general positive attitude toward vaccines as well as the intention to get vaccinated. On the whole, the results of this study reveal a general misunderstanding of vaccine efficacy that may have serious consequences for the perceived benefits of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and, thus, the willingness to be vaccinated.","Tentori, K.; Passerini, A.; Timberlake, B.; Pighin, S.",Soc Sci Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34619632/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953621006055; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953621006055?v=s5,282
602846,"Academic Achievement in Spanish Secondary School Students: The Inter-Related Role of Executive Functions, Physical Activity and Gender",2021-02-13,"After initial reluctance masks have emerged as an important means of restricting the spread of SARS-CoV‑2, the new coronavirus causing COVID-19. Other simple measures are keeping a distance of at least 1 ½ m from other persons and observing hygiene recommendations, including washing or even disinfecting the hands, coughing into the crook of the arm and remaining at home when sick. Combining the initial letters of the German words for the three measures (Abstand-Hygiene-Alltagsmaske, distance-hygiene-face mask) the acronym AHA was formed, a colloquial German word meaning that the speaker understood the information presented. This acronym was later extended by the letter “L”, initial letter of “Lüften” meaning air ventilation for indoor rooms and arriving at AHA‑L, recommended by the federal German Health Institute the Robert Koch Institute. In fact, masks including surgical masks and face coverings can form an effective barrier against the spread of the virus: protecting other people from droplets expelled from the throat of the speaker wearing a mask and even in part protecting the wearer from inhaling droplets emanating from other peoples’ throats. Studies to find out if wearing masks might impose risks did not find essential problems: alterations of respiratory parameters due to an increased airway resistance remained within normal limits in healthy adults and even in asthmatics whose disease was well controlled; however, many adults expressed their unease with masks describing them as cumbersome and inconvenient. Emotional resistance against masks made it increasingly more difficult for them to use a mask. Efficient application of masks requires, in addition to a logical explanation of its effect, the evocation of empathy for vulnerable people who can be protected from catching a possibly deadly disease. In children there are very few data on adverse effects of wearing a mask although there is ample experience in children with serious diseases compromising defense against infectious agents acquired via respiratory mucus membranes; however, when using masks appropriately in children relevant adverse effects have not been reported and are not to be expected. Masks should only be used in children when they are healthy and awake and can remove the masks themselves anytime they like. Children 10 years or older can use masks efficiently when they have been informed beforehand appropriate to their age. Under these conditions they can also be obliged to wear masks in certain situations, for example while walking through the school building to their desk in class. To limit the period of wearing a mask normally they will be allowed to remove the mask when sitting in class and keeping their distance. Children in primary schools may use masks, but they should not be obliged to wear them and children in kindergartens should not use masks. This exemption of younger children does not expose school and kindergarten teachers to additional risks since the infectivity with SARS-CoV‑2 is age-dependent and increases with age reaching adult values only after 12 years of age.","Huppertz, Hans-Iko; Berner, Reinhard; Schepker, Renate; Kopp, Matthias; Oberle, Andreas; Fischbach, Thomas; Rodeck, Burkhard; Knuf, Markus; Keller, Matthias; Simon, Arne; Hübner, Johannes",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33353989/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00112-020-01090-9,282

An Umbrella Systematic Review,2021-04-20,"This article describes patterns of compliance with social distancing measures among the Spanish population during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It identifies several factors associated with higher or lower compliance with recommended measures of social distancing. This research is part of a 67-country study, titled the International COVID-19 study on Social & Moral Psychology, in which we use a Spanish dataset. Participants were residents in Spain aged 18 or above. The sample comprises 1,090 respondents, weighted to be representative of the Spanish population. Frequencies, correlations, bivariate analysis, and six models based on hierarchical multiple regressions were applied. The main finding is that most Spaniards are compliant with established guidelines of social distance during the pandemic (State of Alarm, before May 2020). Variables associated more with lower levels of compliance with these standards were explored. Six hierarchical multiple regression models found that compliance with social distance measures has a multifactorial explanation (R(2) between 20.4 and 49.1%). Sociodemographic factors, personal hygiene patterns, and the interaction between personal hygiene patterns and the support for political measures related to the coronavirus brought significant effects on the regression models. Less compliance was also associated with beliefs in some specific conspiracy theories with regard to COVID-19 or general conspiracy mentality (Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire, CMQ), consumption patterns of traditional mass media (television, paper newspapers, magazines, and radio) and modern means to get informed (online digital newspapers, blogs, and social networks), political ideology, vote, trust in institutions, and political identification. Among the future lines of action in preventing the possible outbreak of the virus, we suggest measures to reinforce trust in official information, mainly linked to reducing the influence of disinformation and conspiracy theories parallel to the pandemic.","Gualda, Estrella; Krouwel, Andre; Palacios-Gálvez, Marisol; Morales-Marente, Elena; Rodríguez-Pascual, Iván; García-Navarro, E.

IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS -21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. The mean IES-R, DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress subscale and ISI scores were higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p<0.001). Serious worries about their physical health, anger and impulsivity and intense suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p<0.05). More than one-third of psychiatric patients might fulfil the diagnostic criteria post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More than one-quarter of psychiatric patients suffered from moderately severe to severe insomnia. Respondents who reported no change, poor or worse physical health status and had a psychiatric illness were significantly more likely to have higher mean IES-R, DASS depression, anxiety and stress subscale scores and ISI scores (p<0.05). This study confirms the severity of negative psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown measures.

603748,Aging at Work: A Review of Recent Trends and Future Directions,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) has been reported in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there are knowledge gaps about the severity, prevalence, etiology, and duration of OD in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Olfactory function was assessed in all participants using questionnaires and the butanol threshold test (BTT). Patients with COVID-19 and abnormal olfaction were further evaluated using the smell identification test (SIT), sinus imaging, and nasoendoscopy. Selected patients received nasal biopsies. Systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed items from January 1, 2020 to April 23, 2020 were searched. Studies that reported clinical data on olfactory disturbances in COVID-19 patients were analyzed. RESULTS: We included 18 COVID-19 patients and 18 controls. Among COVID-19 patients, 12 of 18 (67%) reported olfactory symptoms and OD was confirmed in 6 patients by BTT and SIT. Olfactory dysfunction was the only symptom in 2 patients. Mean BTT score of patients was worse than controls (P = .004, difference in means = 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.6–2.9). Sinusitis and olfactory cleft obstruction were absent in most patients. Immunohistochemical analysis of nasal biopsy revealed the presence of infiltrative CD68(+) macrophages harboring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen in the stroma. Olfactory dysfunction persisted in 2 patients despite clinical recovery. Systematic review showed that the prevalence of olfactory disturbances in COVID-19 ranged from 5% to 98%. Most studies did not assess olfaction quantitatively. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory dysfunction is common in COVID-19 and may be the only symptom. Coronavirus disease 2019-related OD can be severe and prolonged. Mucosal infiltration by CD68(+) macrophages expressing SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen may contribute to COVID-19-related OD.","Chung, Tom Wai-Hin; Sridhar, Siddharth; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Li, Hang-Long; Wong, Fergus Kai-Chuen; Ng, Ming-Yen; Tsang, Raymond King-Yin; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Fan, Zhimeng; Ho, Ronnie Siu-Lun; Luk, Shiobhon Yiu; Kan, Wai-Kuen; Lam, Sonia Hiu-Yin; Wu, Alan Ka-Lun; Leung, Sau-Man; Chan, Wai-Ming; Ng, Pauline Yeung; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Lung, Kwok-Cheung; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32548209/,282

605508,Evidence of Better Psychological Profile in Working Population Meeting Current Physical Activity Recommendations,2021-08-26,"Background: The global SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused substantial worldwide mortality. At present, there is no data regarding oncologist-specific SARS-CoV-2 infection/immunity rates in the United Kingdom (UK) which might impact planning for the management of potentially immunosuppressed cancer patients. Here, we present the first results from the COVID-19 Serology in Oncology Staff (CSOS) study with the aim of informing non-surgical oncology management guidelines. Methods: Patient-facing staff working in an oncology department during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large district general hospital in the East of England were invited to participate. Samples were collected during the first week of June 2020: blood for SARS-COV-2 antibody testing using a rapid lateral flow point of care (POC) assay and a laboratory Luminex based assay, as well as a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Participant characteristics were also collected. Results: Seventy participants were recruited: nurses (45/70; 64.3%), doctors (15/70; 21.2%), and other patient-facing staff (10/70; 14.3%). The majority were female (61/70; 87.1%) with a mean age of 42 years (median 41; range 23-64 years). A minority were smokers (9/70; 10%) or had chronic underlying health conditions (16/70; 22.9%), the commonest being asthma. All participants were nasopharyngeal-swab PCR negative, although 4/70 (5.7%) had previously tested positive by NHS testing undertaken during the preceding months. 15/70 (21.4%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Luminex test. Nurses had the highest incidence of positive antibodies (13/45; 28.9%), with a lower incidence in doctors (2/15; 13.3%) although this difference was not statistically significant (Fischer's exact test p=0.3). No receptionists had positive antibody tests. All four participants with a previously reported positive PCR test were antibody-positive. 9/15 (60%) of antibody-positive participants reported previous symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a 3.6-fold higher odds than antibody-negative participants, of whom 16/55 reported symptoms (p=0.03). The mean duration of symptoms was 11 days (median 11; range 1-35 days) and the mean time from resolution of reported previous symptoms to antibody testing was 48.4 days (median 46; range 1-123 days). Conclusion: This study establishes the SARS-CoV-2 exposure and carriage rate amongst patient-facing staff working in the oncology department of a large UK general hospital during the pandemic. These results may help inform UK national oncology patient management prior to the development of a viable vaccine or treatment.","Favara, D.

Infection control precautions for hospital visitors are needed to avoid cluster outbreaks, so this study investigated the visiting policies of all the hospitals in Taiwan in the time of COVID-19. METHODS: From March 15, 2020, to March 18, 2020, we searched the official websites of all 472 National Health Insurance–contracted hospitals to determine their visiting policies. For those hospitals that had posted new visiting policies and still allowed visits to ordinary wards, we recorded the relevant details shown on their websites, including the number of visitors allowed at one time, the number of visiting slots per day, the total visiting hours per day, and the rules provided to visitors before visiting. RESULTS: During the study period, 276 (58.5%) hospitals had posted new visiting policies on their websites, with higher proportions of academic medical centers (92.0%, 23/25) and metropolitan hospitals (91.5%, 75/82) than local community hospitals (48.8%, 178/365) doing so. Visits to ordinary wards were forbidden in 83 hospitals among those. Among the 193 hospitals that had new visiting policies and still allowed visits to ordinary wards, 73.1% (n = 141) restricted visitors to two at a time and 54.9% (n = 106) restricted visits to two visiting slots per day. Furthermore, history taking regarding travel, occupation, contacts, and cluster information was mentioned by 82.4% (n = 159) of these 193 hospitals, body temperature monitoring by 78.2% (n = 151), hand hygiene by 63.2% (n = 122), and identity checks by 51.8% (n = 100). CONCLUSION: In the time of COVID-19 covered by this study, about three-fifths of the hospitals in Taiwan had posted their visiting policies for ordinary wards on their websites. Furthermore, the thoroughness with which such visiting policies have been enforced also requires investigation.","Liu, Ya-An; Hsu, Ya-Chuan; Lin, Ming-Hwai; Chang, Hsiao-Ting; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Chou, Li-Fang; Hwang, Shinn-Jang",J Chin Med Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32332514/; https://doi.org/10.1097/jcma.0000000000000326,282

Decisions to test or not to test and, if testing, how many tests, how often and for how long, are complex decisions that need to be taken under uncertainty and conflicting pressures from various stakeholders. METHOD: We have developed an agent-based model and simulation tool that can be used to analyze the outcomes and effectiveness of different testing strategies and scenarios in schools with various number of classrooms and class sizes. We have applied a modified version of a standard SEIR disease transmission model that includes symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious populations, and that incorporates feasible public health measures. We also incorporated a pre-symptomatic phase for symptomatic cases. Every day, a random number of students in each class are tested. If they tested positive, they are placed in self-isolation at home when the test results are provided. Last but not least, we have included options to allow for full testing or complete self-isolation of a classroom with a positive case. RESULTS: We present sample simulation results for parameter values based on schools and disease related information, in the Province of Ontario, Canada. The findings show that testing can be an effective method in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools if taken frequently, with expedited test results and self-isolation of infected students at home. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that while testing cannot eliminate the risk and has its own challenges, it can significantly control outbreaks when combined with other measures, such as masks and other protective measures.","Asgary, Ali; Cojocaru, Monica Gabriela; Najafabadi, Mahdi M.; Wu, Jianhong",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33430832/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-10153-1,282

The aim was to investigate the efficacy, safety and feasibility of HBO in patients with RVF in CD. METHODS: In this prospective study, consecutive CD patients between November 2018 and February 2020 presenting with RVF at the outpatient fistula clinic of the Amsterdam University Medical Centre were included and selected to receive treatment with 30 daily HBO sessions, if fistulas were actively draining and any concomitant treatment regimen was stable at least 6 weeks prior to start of HBO. Patients with a stoma were excluded. The primary endpoint was clinical closure at 3-month follow-up, defined as cessation of complaints and/or closure of the external orifice if visible at baseline. Secondary outcomes were improvement of concomitant perianal fistulas as measured by the perianal disease activity index (PDAI) and fistula drainage assessment (FDA), as well as improvement in patient-reported outcomes (visual analogue scale (VAS), inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ), faecal incontinence quality of life scale (FIQL) and female sexual functioning index (FSFI)) at 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Out of 14 eligible patients, nine patients (median age 50 years) were treated, all of whom had previously had one or more unsuccessful medical and/or surgical treatments for their RVF. Clinical closure occurred in none of the patients at 3-month follow-up. There was no improvement in PDAI and patient-reported outcomes (VAS, IBDQ, FIQL and FSFI). Two patients had concomitant perianal fistulas; using FDA, one patient had a clinical response and one patient was in clinical remission 3 months after HBO. There were two treatment-related adverse events during HBO concerning claustrophobia and fatigue. Furthermore, two patients had a surgical intervention due to RVF and two patients were treated with antibiotics for a urinary tract infection during follow-up. One patient had a dose reduction of ustekinumab because of decreased luminal complaints. CONCLUSION: Treatment with HBO was feasible, but in this therapy-refractory cohort without deviating ostomy no clinical closure of RVF or improvement in quality of life was seen 3 months after HBO. Treatment with HBO alone in this specific group of patients therefore appears to be ineffective.","Lansdorp, C A; Buskens, C J; Gecse, K B; D’Haens, G R A M; van Hulst, R A",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046674/; https://doi.org/10.1093/bjsopen/zrab042,282

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with laboratory-confirmed bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia, hyperinflammation (C reactive protein ≥20 mg/dl), no hypoxemia (oxygen saturation >90%) and no contra-indications to TCZ, who were treated with subcutaneous TCZ (324 mg) administered within 48 hours from hospitalization on top of standard of care (SOC), and compared them with matched controls treated with SOC only before TCZ was available at our center. Clinical data were available for all patients until death or, for those discharged from hospital, until day 35. FINDINGS: Ten consecutive patients (6 males, median age 55 years) treated with TCZ on top of SOC, and ten patients (6 males, median age 56 years) treated with SOC only were included. TCZ was well-tolerated, with no clinically relevant adverse events. TCZ was associated with a reduction in CRP at day 1 (−50%, IQR −28 to −80) and day 3 (−89%, IQR −79 to −96; P = 0.005 for within-group), whereas there was no significant change in CRP values in the SOC group (P < 0.001 for between-groups comparisons at both time points). TCZ resulted in a parallel improvement of oxygenation, as assessed by the ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F) ratio, which increased at day 1 (+11%, IQR + 6 to +16; P = 0.005 for within-group, and P = 0.006 for between-groups comparisons), and day 3 (+23%, IQR + 16 to +34; P = 0.005 for within-group, and P = 0.003 for between-groups comparisons). None of the TCZ-treated patients had disease progression defined as requirement of oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation, whereas progression occurred in 5 (50%) patients among the SOC group. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose subcutaneous TCZ may be a safe and promising therapeutic option administered on top of SOC to prevent disease progression in hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 and hyperinflammation.","Potere, Nicola; Di Nisio, Marcello; Rizzo, Giulia; La Vella, Matteo; Polilli, Ennio; Agostinone, Adriana; Spacone, Antonella; Di Carlo, Silvio; Costantini, Alberto; Abbate, Antonio; Porreca, Ettore; Parruti, Giustino",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.07.078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32768701/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220306160; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220306160?v=s5,282

However, the dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains poorly understood. Replication-competent recombinant viruses expressing reporter genes provide valuable tools to investigate viral infection. Low levels of reporter gene expressed from previous reporter-expressing recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 in the locus of the open reading frame (ORF)7a protein have jeopardized their use to monitor the dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro or in vivo. Here, we report an alternative strategy where reporter genes were placed upstream of the highly expressed viral nucleocapsid (N) gene followed by a porcine tescherovirus (PTV-1) 2A proteolytic cleavage site. The higher levels of reporter expression using this strategy resulted in efficient visualization of rSARS-CoV-2 in infected cultured cells and excised lungs or whole organism of infected K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice. Importantly, real-time viral infection was readily tracked using a noninvasive in vivo imaging system and allowed us to rapidly identify antibodies which are able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Notably, these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2, in which a viral gene was not deleted, not only retained wild-type (WT) virus-like pathogenicity in vivo but also exhibited high stability in vitro and in vivo, supporting their use to investigate viral infection, dissemination, pathogenesis, and therapeutic interventions for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.","Ye, Chengjin; Chiem, Kevin; Park, Jun-Gyu; Silvas, Jesus A; Morales Vasquez, Desarey; Sourimant, Julien; Lin, Michelle J; Greninger, Alexander L; Plemper, Richard K; Torrelles, Jordi B; Kobie, James J; Walter, Mark R; de la Torre, Juan Carlos; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis",Proc.

608850,Worldwide Research Trends on Solar-Driven Water Disinfection,2021-09-06,"Perioperative adjuvant treatment has become an increasingly important aspect of the management of patients with non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In particular, the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as antibodies against PD‐1 and PD‐L1, in patients with lung cancer has increased our expectations for the success of these therapeutics as neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Neoadjuvant therapy is widely used in patients with resectable stage IIIA NSCLC and can reduce primary tumor and lymph node stage, improve the complete resection rate, and eliminate microsatellite foci; however, complete pathological response is rare. Moreover, because the clinical benefit of neoadjuvant therapy is not obvious and may complicate surgery, it has not yet entered the mainstream of clinical treatment. Small‐scale clinical studies performed in recent years have shown improvements in the major pathological remission rate after neoadjuvant therapy, suggesting that it will soon become an important part of NSCLC treatment. Nevertheless, neoadjuvant immunotherapy may be accompanied by serious adverse reactions that lead to delay or cancellation of surgery, additional illness, and even death, and have therefore attracted much attention. In this article, we draw on several sources of information, including (i) guidelines on adverse reactions related to immune checkpoint inhibitors, (ii) published data from large‐scale clinical studies in thoracic surgery, and (iii) practical experience and published cases, to provide clinical recommendations on adverse events in NSCLC patients induced by perioperative immunotherapy.","Ni, Jun; Huang, Miao; Zhang, Li; Wu, Nan; Bai, Chun‐Xue; Chen, Liang‐An; Liang, Jun; Liu, Qian; Wang, Jie; Wu, Yi‐Long; Zhang, Feng‐Chun; Zhang, Shu‐Yang; Chen, Chun; Chen, Jun; Fang, Wen‐Tao; Gao, Shu‐Geng; Hu, Jian; Jiang, Tao; Li, Shan‐Qing; Li, He‐Cheng; Liao, Yong‐De; Liu, Yang; Liu, De‐Ruo; Liu, Hong‐Xu; Liu, Jian‐Yang; Liu, Lun‐Xu; Wang, Meng‐Zhao; Wang, Chang‐Li; Yang, Fan; Yang, Yue; Zhang, Lan‐Jun; Zhi, Xiu‐Yi; Zhong, Wen‐Zhao; Guan, Yu‐Zhou; Guo, Xiao‐Xiao; He, Chun‐Xia; Li, Shao‐Lei; Li, Yue; Liang, Nai‐Xin; Lu, Fang‐Liang; Lv, Chao; Lv, Wei; Si, Xiao‐Yan; Tan, Feng‐Wei; Wang, Han‐Ping; Wang, Jiang‐Shan; Yan, Shi; Yang, Hua‐Xia; Zhu, Hui‐Juan; Zhuang, Jun‐Ling; Zhuo, Ming‐Lei",Thorac Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33787090/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1759-7714.13942,282

We describe the ages and nature of fVDEs in an infant birth cohort and explore factors associated with increased odds of symptomatic fVDEs. METHODS: The Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID) study is a community-based birth cohort describing acute respiratory infections in infants until their second birthday. Parents recorded daily symptoms and collected nose swabs weekly, which were batch-tested using polymerase chain reaction assays for 17 respiratory viruses. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-eight infants participated in ORChID. The median age for fVDEs was 2.9 months for human rhinovirus (HRV) but was ≥13.9 months for other respiratory viruses. Overall, 52% of HRV fVDEs were symptomatic, compared with 57%–83% of other fVDEs. Respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus fVDEs were more severe than HRV fVDEs. Older age and the winter season were associated with symptomatic episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Infants do not always experience respiratory symptoms with their fVDE. Predominance of early HRV detections highlights the need for timing any intervention early in life. fVDEs from other respiratory viruses most commonly occur when maternal vaccines may no longer provide protection.","Sarna, Mohinder; Ware, Robert S; Lambert, Stephen B; Sloots, Theo P; Nissen, Michael D; Grimwood, Keith",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29165576/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jix599,282

Previously published papers have demonstrated that increased levels of D-dimer at hospital admission correlate with a more severe disease (0.5 mg/L) or occurrence of death (1 mg/L). The potential prothrombotic action of the SARS-CoV-2 is supported by the topographical involvement of the lung regions with a predilection for the lower lobe with peripheral involvement. If this hypothesis is demonstrated, this could suggest the benefit of using antithrombotic/coagulation regimens for SARS-CoV-2 and, at the same time, the urgency to identify drugs that could alter the inflammatory storm, thus protecting the vessel wall.","Saba, Luca; Sverzellati, Nicola",J Thorac Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32349055/; https://doi.org/10.1097/rti.0000000000000530,282

A controversial area concerns the safety of surgically created smoke and the perceived potential higher risk in laparoscopic surgery. METHODS: The limited published evidence was analysed in combination with expert opinion. A review was undertaken of the novel coronavirus with regards to its hazards within surgical smoke and the procedures that could mitigate the potential risks to healthcare staff. RESULTS: Using existing knowledge of surgical smoke, a theoretical risk of virus transmission exists. Best practice should consider the operating room set‐up, patient movement and operating theatre equipment when producing a COVID‐19 operating protocol. The choice of energy device can affect the smoke produced, and surgeons should manage the pneumoperitoneum meticulously during laparoscopic surgery. Devices to remove surgical smoke, including extractors, filters and non‐filter devices, are discussed in detail. CONCLUSION: There is not enough evidence to quantify the risks of COVID‐19 transmission in surgical smoke. However, steps can be undertaken to manage the potential hazards. The advantages of minimally invasive surgery may not need to be sacrificed in the current crisis.","Mowbray, N.

However, the validity of health-related information on psoriatic arthritis (PsA) on YouTube has not been determined. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and quality of YouTube videos concerning PsA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A YouTube search was performed on April 18, 2021, using the keyword “psoriatic arthritis.” Two independent raters accessed the content, source, and detailed characteristics of the included videos. The reliability and quality of the videos were analyzed using the modified DISCERN score, Journal of the American Medical Association benchmark criteria score, and global quality scale score. RESULTS: Of the 200 videos screened, 155 were included in the study after applying the exclusion criteria. A total of 132 (85.2%) videos revealed useful information about PsA, whereas the remaining 23 (14.8%) were misleading. Video interaction parameters including the median number of views, views per day, likes, dislikes, and comments demonstrated no significant difference between the two groups. The videos posted by universities and professional organizations displayed the highest reliability and quality scores. CONCLUSION: The majority of YouTube videos on PsA contained useful information. However, physicians should alert patients to the possibility of misinformation and non-validated sources.

The study is motivated by the lack of understanding of the flow-field characteristics and droplet distribution during aerosol-generating procedures. The particle image velocimetry measurements with high temporal and spatial resolutions were performed under ultrasonic scaling in the mockup experimental dental clinic. Compared with other methods focusing on the settled droplet particles, the study focused on the visualization of suspended droplets. From the results of the velocity vector and trajectory map, the high-level contaminated area will be within 1 m from the oral cavity. The vortex structures were identified by the vorticity index. In the surface near the patient's head, a counterclockwise vortex would carry some droplets and contaminate this region. The small droplets circulated in the turbulence cloud and the droplet nuclei generated by dehydration are the two primary sources of suspended particles, which may cause airborne transmission in the dental clinic. About 65%–74% of the droplets in ultrasonic scaling were in the range of 50–180 [Formula: see text]. The research will provide references to the development of the precaution measures to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk of dental professionals.","Li, Xiujie; Mak, Cheuk Ming; Ma, Kuen Wai; Wong, Hai Ming",Phys Fluids (1994),https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0048848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33953531/,282

CASE REPORT: A 63-year-old woman with a past medical history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in remission while on maintenance therapy with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, obinutuzumab, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing over 12 weeks and persistently tested seronegative for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay technology. During this time, the patient experienced waxing and waning of symptoms, which included fever, myalgia, and non-productive cough, but never acquired severe respiratory distress. She was admitted to our hospital on illness day 88, and her symptoms resolved after the administration of convalescent plasma. CONCLUSIONS: As the understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, we can currently only speculate about the occurrence of chronic infection vs. reinfection. The protective role of antibodies and their longevity against SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. Since humoral immunity has an integral role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, various phase 3 vaccine trials are underway.

Mais nous ne connaissons pas encore très bien les atteintes tissulaires qui sous-tendent ces évènements. Les atteintes liées aux SARS-Cov-2 semblent être multiples et ne sont pas encore très bien comprises. Ce travail a donc pour but de déterminer les causes du décès des patients infecter par le COVID-19. puis de décrire les lésions sur le plan anatomopathologique sur les différents organes prélevés imputable au virus SARS-Cov-2, d’objectiver l la présence du SARS-Cov-2 dans les différents compartiment et organes prélevés et d’établir une corrélation anatomoclinique et virologique lié au SARS-CoV-2 sur les différents tissus prélevés. Matériels et méthodes Les patients ont été autopsiés dans le délais légal autorisé par la loi dans le département de médecine légale de notre centre après obtention du consentement des proches et vérifications que les patients ne faisaient pas partie du registre des refus d’autopsies. Les autopsies ont réalisé par la technique de Ghon et des prélèvements à visées virologiques et histologiques ont été réalisé dans les organes suivants : cœur, poumon, foie, reins, encéphale, rate, pancréas, surrénales. Résultats Tous les patients autopsiés sont décédés lors de leur séjour en réanimation pour une infection sévère documenté à SARS-COV-2 ayant nécessité une ventilation mécanique. Trois patients étaient des hommes et 2 des femmes, l’âge moyen était de 64,6 ans, l’âge médian de 59 ans, avec un âge maximum de 82 ans et un âge minimum de 51 ans. Sur l’ensemble des investigations réalisés sur les 5 patients l’examen macroscopique pulmonaire retrouvait des lésions marquées avec dommage alvéolaire diffus caractérisées par d’abondantes membranes hyalines intra-alvéolaires montrant focalement un début d’organisation avec des ébauches de corps de Masson s’accordant avec une infection respiratoire virale. Sur les 5 patients 3 présentaient des lésions thromboemboliques soit focales soit diffuses avec de nombreux remaniements hémorragiques. L’ensemble des patients présentaient des lésions de pancréatite aiguë à l’examen associé à des microfoyer de suffusions hémorragiques à l’examen microscopique. Enfin, les autres lésions notables concernent l’encéphale avec la constations de lésion prédominant au niveau du tronc notamment du noyau du vague, avec parfois des lésions plus au niveau du cortex. Dans l’ensemble des cas, le splénium semble touché. Chez un patient on observe de nombreuses lésions hémorragiques de topographie diffuse (pétéchies). Cependant aucunes lésions nécrotiques ne furent décrites au niveau cérébral. Conclusion Les première analyses macroscopique et microscopique des patients décédés en réanimation de formes sévère de COVID-19 présentent des lésions nombreuses impactant l’ensemble des organes mais avec un tropisme marqué sur le plan pulmonaire avec des atteintes thrombotiques diffuses ainsi que des atteintes hétérogène sur le plan cérébrale nécessitant encore un complément d’exploration notamment par immunohistochimie.","Bessis, S.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X20303772; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X20303772,282

The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for data scientists to model COVID‐19, when the epidemiological characteristics of the COVID‐19 are yet to be fully explained. The uncertainty around the COVID‐19 with no vaccine and effective medicine available until today create additional pressure on the epidemiologists and policy makers. In such a crucial situation, it is very important to predict infected cases to support prevention of the disease and aid in the preparation of healthcare service. In this paper, we have tried to understand the spreading capability of COVID‐19 in India taking into account of the lockdown period. The numbers of confirmed cases are increased in India and states in the past few weeks. A differential equation based simple model has been used to understand the pattern of COVID‐19 in India and some states. Our findings suggest that the physical distancing and lockdown strategies implemented in India are successfully reducing the spread and that the tempo of pandemic growth has slowed in recent days.","Singh, Brijesh P.; Singh, Gunjan",J Public Aff,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837325/; https://doi.org/10.1002/pa.2257,282

Initial observations show that especially among younger vaccinated people side effects are common. In this study, using the example of clinic employees, the self-perceived well-being after the first and second dose of the vaccine was examined. Methods Anonymized online questionnaire to be filled out once by all employees after the second dose of BNT162B2 was offered. The severity of side effects was queried using an ordinal numerical rating scale with values between 0 and 10. Other key data points were age, gender, and occupational group. The ability to work in the days following the injections was recorded by self-reporting. Results Data from 555 respondents were evaluated. The mean age was 40.25 years (standard deviation 12.35). 56 % of the respondents were female, 44.3 % belonged to the medical service, 42.9 % to the nursing service and 12.8 % were assigned to other professional groups with COVID-19 patient contact. Around 2 % of all employees did not experience any side effects at all. The most common side effect was pain at the injection site. Fatigue, headaches and myalgia followed with decreasing frequency. After the first dose, ¾ of the respondents said they had tolerated the vaccination well overall, after the second dose it was only half. After the first dose, over 90 % of the respondents felt that they were able to work again on the following day, after the second dose one third stated that they were only able to work again on the second day. 2.2 % of all employees had to report that they were unable to work for at least one day after the first dose and 19.5 % after the second dose. Conclusions Vaccination with BNT162B2 frequently leads to side effects, especially after the second dose. Perception of side effects resulted in 19 % of those questioned being sick after the second dose. Nevertheless, 95 % of all respondents would choose a coronavirus vaccination again.","Kalbhenn, Johannes; Hammer, Thorsten; Hug, Martin; Dürschmied, Daniel; Wenz, Frederik; Steinmann, Daniel",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34243217/; https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1520-2127,282

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the trend in mortality at our large tertiary academic health system and factors contributing to this trend. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of intensive care unit (ICU) patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March and August 2020 admitted across 14 hospitals in the Philadelphia area. Collected data included demographics, comorbidities, admission risk of mortality score, laboratory values, medical interventions, survival outcomes, hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS) and discharge disposition. Chi-square (χ(2)) test, Fisher exact test, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method, multinomial logistic regression models, independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used. RESULTS: A total of 1,204 patients were included. Overall mortality was 39%. Mortality declined significantly from 46% in March to 14% in August 2020 (P < 0.05). The most common underlying comorbidities were hypertension (60.2%), diabetes mellitus (44.7%), dyslipidemia (31.6%) and congestive heart failure (14.7%). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) use was more commonly associated with the patients who died, while the use of remdesivir, tocilizumab, steroids and duration of these medications were not significantly different. Peak values of ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in patients who died (P < 0.05). The mean hospital LOS was significantly longer in the patients who survived compared to the patients who died (18 vs. 12, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The mortality of patients admitted to our ICU system significantly decreased over time.

In this review, we conducted a descriptive analysis of CSF findings in patients with COVID-19 to understand prognosis and explore therapeutic options. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus databases using the keywords “SARS-CoV-2 in cerebrospinal fluid”, “SARS-CoV-2 and CNS Complications”"" for reports of CSF findings in COVID-19 related neurological manifestations. Descriptive analysis were conducted to observe the CSF protein and cell counts based on age, gender, severity and fatality of COVID-19, and whether central (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS). RESULTS: A total of 113 patients were identified from 67 studies. Of these, 7 patients (6.2 %) were fatal COVID-19 cases and 35 patients (31%) were considered severe COVID-19 cases. CSF protein was elevated in 100% (7/7) of the fatal cases with an average of 61.28 mg/dl, and in 65.0 % (52/80) in non-fatal cases with an average 56.73 mg/dl. CSF protein levels were elevated in 74.5% (38/51) patients with non-severe COVID-19 and 68.6% (24/35) in those with a severe COVID-19 infection. CSF cell count was increased in 43% of fatal cases, 25.7% severe cases and 29.4% of non-severe cases.

Therefore, we addressed the role of IL-17A during allergic asthma and antiviral immune response in human and murine immunocompetent cells. In this study we found that asthmatic children with a RV infection in their upper airways have upregulated mRNA levels of the antiviral cytokine interferon type I (IFN)-β and the transcription factor T-box 21 (TBX21) and reduced levels of IL-17A protein in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We also found that IL-17A inhibited RV1b replication in infected human lung epithelial cells A549. Furthermore, by using gene array analysis we discovered that targeted deletion of Il17a in murine lung CD4(+) T cells impaired Oas1g mRNA downstream of Ifnβ, independently from RV infection. Additionally, in PBMCs of children with a RV infection in their nasalpharyngeal fluid OAS1 gene expression was found downregulated. Finally RV1b inhibited IL-17A production in lung CD4(+) T cells in a setting of experimental asthma. These results indicate that the RV1b inhibits IL-17A in T helper type 17 cells and IL-17A clears RV1b infection in epithelial cells. In both cases IL-17A contributes to fend off RV1b infection by inducing genes downstream of interferon type I pathway.

614861,Prevalence and Risk Factors of Infection in the Representative COVID-19 Cohort Munich,2021-03-30,"A link between Covid-19 and development of autoimmunity has been reported. A possible explanation could be molecular mimicry between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins. Peptide sharing has been found between antigenic epitopes of this virus and heat shock proteins (Hsp) 60 and 90, both of which are associated with autoimmune diseases including those of the bullous type. In particular, there is evidence for the latter Hsp acting as a pathophysiological factor and treatment target in autoimmune blistering dermatoses. Considering multimodal anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action of anti-Hsp90 treatment and drug repositioning results, it may be hypothesized that Hsp90 inhibition could also be a treatment option for cytokine storm-mediated acute respiratory distress syndrome in Covid-19 patients. Hence, although Covid-19-induced autoimmune bullous diseases have not been described in the literature so far, the potential relationship between Covid-19, Hsp, and these autoimmune disorders deserves further attention with respect to both pathophysiology and treatment.","Kasperkiewicz, Michael",Cell Stress Chaperones,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33196989/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12192-020-01180-3,282

With the prevalence of drug-resistant strains on the rise and new therapies for tuberculosis urgently required, we assessed whether manipulating iron levels in macrophages infected with mycobacteria offered some insight into improving current antimicrobials that are used to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis. We investigated if the iron chelator, desferrioxamine, can support the function of human macrophages treated with an array of second-line antimicrobials, including moxifloxacin, bedaquiline, amikacin, clofazimine, linezolid and cycloserine. Primary human monocyte-derived macrophages were infected with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), which is pyrazinamide-resistant, and concomitantly treated for 5 days with desferrioxamine in combination with each one of the second-line tuberculosis antimicrobials. Our data indicate that desferrioxamine used as an adjunctive treatment to bedaquiline significantly reduced the bacterial load in human macrophages infected with BCG. Our findings also reveal a link between enhanced bactericidal activity and increases in specific cytokines, as the addition of desferrioxamine increased levels of IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-1β in BCG-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) treated with bedaquiline. These results provide insight, and an in vitro proof-of-concept, that iron chelators may prove an effective adjunctive therapy in combination with current tuberculosis antimicrobials.","Cahill, Christina; O’Connell, Fiona; Gogan, Karl M.; Cox, Donal J.; Basdeo, Sharee A.; O’Sullivan, Jacintha; Gordon, Stephen V.; Keane, Joseph; Phelan, James J.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33805837/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22062938,282

Here, we describe the development, validation and clinical evaluation of a protein micro-array as a quantitative multiplex immunoassay that can identify S and N-directed SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies with high specificity and sensitivity and distinguish them from all currently circulating human coronaviruses. The method specificity was 100% for SARS-CoV-2 S1 and 96% for N antigen based on extensive syndromic (n=230 cases) and population panel (n=94) testing that also confirmed the high prevalence of seasonal human coronaviruses. To assess its potential role for both SARS-CoV-2 patient diagnostics and population studies, we evaluated a large heterogeneous COVID-19 cohort (n=330) and found an overall sensitivity of 89% (≥ 21 days post onset symptoms (dps)), ranging from 86% to 96% depending on severity of disease. For a subset of these patients longitudinal samples were provided up to 56 dps. Mild cases showed absent or delayed, and lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. Overall, we present the development and extensive clinical validation of a multiplex coronavirus serological assay for syndromic testing, to answer research questions regarding to antibody responses, to support SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and to evaluate epidemiological developments efficiently and with high-throughput.","van Tol, Sophie; Mögling, Ramona; Li, Wentao; Godeke, Gert-Jan; Swart, Arno; Bergmans, Barbara; Brandenburg, Afke; Kremer, Kristin; Murk, Jean-Luc; van Beek, Josine; Wintermans, Bas; Reimerink, Johan; Bosch, Berend-Jan; Reusken, Chantal",Emerging microbes & infections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32819220/; https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1813636,282

It is not understood whether the failure of a particular organ contributes more significantly to the severity of CRS. Also not known is whether a specific cytokine or signaling pathway plays a more pathogenic role in precipitating MOD compared to others. As a result, there is no specific treatment available to date for CRS, and it is managed only symptomatically to support the deteriorating organ functions and maintain the blood pressure. Therefore, we used the superantigen-induced CRS model in HLA-DR3 transgenic mice, that closely mimics human CRS, to delineate the immunopathogenesis of CRS as well as to validate a novel treatment for CRS. Using this model, we demonstrate that (i) CRS is characterized by a rapid rise in systemic levels of several Th1/Th2/Th17/Th22 type cytokines within a few hours, followed by a quick decline. (ii) Even though multiple organs are affected, small intestinal immunopathology is the major contributor to mortality in CRS. (iii) IFN-γ deficiency significantly protected from lethal CRS by attenuating small bowel pathology, whereas IL-17A deficiency significantly increased mortality by augmenting small bowel pathology. (iv) RNA sequencing of small intestinal tissues indicated that IFN-γ-STAT1-driven inflammatory pathways combined with enhanced expression of pro-apoptotic molecules as well as extracellular matrix degradation contributed to small bowel pathology in CRS. These pathways were further enhanced by IL-17A deficiency and significantly down-regulated in mice lacking IFN-γ. (v) Ruxolitinib, a selective JAK-1/2 inhibitor, attenuated SAg-induced T cell activation, cytokine production, and small bowel pathology, thereby completely protecting from lethal CRS in both WT and IL-17A deficient HLA-DR3 mice.

An ad hoc multidisciplinary group was created to address the major public health implications of this messaging. Key messages of this commentary are as follows: 1) The COVID-19 crisis may increase tobacco consumption and decrease access to healthcare. As a result, smoking-related morbidity and mortality could increase in the coming months and years; 2) Smoking and tobacco-related diseases are prognostic factors for severe COVID-19; and 3) In theory, smokers may be at lower risk of COVID-19 infection because of having fewer social contacts. In conclusion, tobacco control is a greater challenge than ever in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public decision-makers must be vigilant in ensuring that public health practices are consistent and compliant with the principles of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. In addition, researchers and the media have a responsibility to be cautious in communicating preliminary results that may promote non-evidence-based research, self-destructive individual behaviours, and commercial agendas.","Alla, François; Berlin, Ivan; Nguyen-Thanh, Viet; Guignard, Romain; Pasquereau, Anne; Quelet, Sylvie; Schwarzinger, Michaël; Arwidson, Pierre",Can J Public Health,https://doi.org/10.17269/s41997-020-00427-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052586/,282

The taxonomic distribution of the gene, “percomORF”, indicates insertion into the ancestral lineage >110 Ma, making it the oldest known conserved gene of viral origin in a vertebrate genome. Underscoring its ancient provenence, percomORF exists as an isolated ORF within the intron of a widely conserved host gene, with no discernible proviral sequence nearby. Despite its remarkable age, percomORF retains canonical features of a retroviral glycoprotein, and tests for selection strongly suggest cooption for a host function. Retroviral envelope genes have been coopted for a role in placentogenesis by numerous lineages of mammals, including eutherians and marsupials, representing a variety of placental structures. Therefore percomORF’s presence within the group Percomorpha—unique among spiny-finned fishes in having evolved placentation and live birth—is especially intriguing.","Henzy, Jamie E.; Gifford, Robert J.; Kenaley, Christopher P.; Johnson, Welkin E.",Molecular Biology and Evolution,https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msw262; https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-pdf/34/3/634/24366921/msw262.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28039384/,282

The assays have been marketed for use in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. For diagnosing bacterial pneumonia, lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens are indicated. Aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of these syndromic panels for these three bacterial targets in samples from the LRT. Fifty-six specimens were collected from our repositories, five negative samples and fifty-one samples which had been previously tested positive with the routine diagnostic real-time PCR assays for Legionella spp. (N = 20), Bordetella spp. (N = 16) or M. pneumoniae (N = 15). RESULTS: The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel V2 (RP) assay detected all of the L. pneumophila and B. pertussis positive samples but only 11/15 (73.3 %) of the M. pneumoniae targets. The ePlex Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) assay detected 10/14 (71.4 %) of the L. pneumophila targets, 8/12 (66.7 %) of the B. pertussis positive samples and 13/15 (86.7 %) of the M. pneumoniae targets. CONCLUSIONS: No false-positive results were reported for all three bacterial pathogens by both assays. The clinical performance of both assays depended highly on the bacterial load in the sample and the type of specimen under investigation.","van Asten, Suzanne A.

METHODS: According to the sMVAP quartiles, we divided all patients into four groups. The clinical electronic medical records, nursing records, laboratory findings, and radiological examinations for all patients with laboratory confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were reviewed. Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) models were used to determine the risk factors associated with in hospital death. RESULTS: A total of 97 patients were included in this study. The “Quartile 4” group 's ICU transfer rate was significantly higher than the “Quartile 1” group. Coronary heart disease, high d-dimer and sMVAP at admission were associated with increased odds of death. CONCLUSIONS: Using the sMVAP index for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) risk assessment, and then predicting the adverse outcomes of COVID-19 patients, is an effective method. Therefore, the use of sMVAP index for OSAHS screening for inpatients with COVID-19 should be vigorously promoted, and high-risk patients should be effectively managed.","Zhang, Sun; Xu, Yuanda; Li, Jieying; Wu, Kang; Wang, Tao; Su, Xiaofen; Han, Qian; Xi, Yin; Gao, Yong; Wang, Hongbo; Hu, Yu; Liu, Chunli; Ran, Pixin; Zhang, Nuofu; Zhong, Nanshan",Sleep Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138994572030397X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138994572030397X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.08.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937279/,282

METHODS: Technical quality of root canal treatment performed clinically by fifth-year undergraduate students was evaluated and divided into two groups: Group 1, teeth treated by students who had attended both a preclinical endodontic block course and an elective preclinical course. Group 2: teeth treated by students who had not attended the elective preclinical course. All students were also invited to participate in a survey to rate their undergraduate endodontic training and confidence levels performing endodontic treatment. Statistical analysis of data was performed using Person chi-square test, Fisher Freeman Halton exact test, and t-test. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups in overall obturation quality (p=0.619). However, more teeth treated by attendees were of adequate obturation length (p=0.015) and lacked procedural errors (p=0.004). Significantly more elective course attendees rated their undergraduate endodontic training as adequate (p=0.002), but there was no significant difference in the level of confidence between the attendees and the non-attendees. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, additional preclinical training showed minimal effect on overall quality of root canal treatment performed clinically by undergraduate students and did not enhance their confidence levels; however, it was associated with more satisfaction with their undergraduate endodontic education.","Barakat, Reem M.; Matoug-Elwerfelli, Manal; Almohareb, Rahaf A.; Balto, Hanan A.",Int J Dent,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34093707/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9920280,282

In particular, this paper describes the development and optimization of a direct method for extracting SARS-CoV-2 RNA from municipal wastewater using magnetic beads. The recovery efficiency of the method using Accuplex SARS-CoV-2 Positive Reference Material (ASCV-2) was examined. Method factors assessed were sample volume, concentration of magnetic bead mix, elution temperature, and water matrix (deionized (DI) water and wastewater). The combination of optimized method parameters that resulted in the highest RNA recovery in both DI water (26.0 {+/-} 0.8%) and wastewater (11.8 {+/-} 1.4%) was a sample volume of 1.0 mL, a magnetic beads concentration of 100 L mL-1 sample, and an elution temperature of 60 {degrees}C. The performance of this optimized method was further assessed in recovery experiments using wastewater samples spiked at 1.8x106 and 1.8x104 gene copies L-1 (GU L-1) with Gamma Inactivated SARS-COV-2 (GI-SCV-2) and 1.0x106 and 1.0x104 infectious units L-1 of Human Coronavirus 229E (HCV 229E) as viral surrogates. Recoveries of 86.1 and 4.6% were achieved for wastewater samples spiked with GI-SCV-2 at low and high concentrations, respectively. In assessing the effects of wastewater pre-filtration and addition of DL-Dithiothreitol (DTT, used to inactivate RNases that may degrade RNA) on recovery efficiency of ASCV-2, the magnetic bead-based extraction protocol performed optimally with unfiltered wastewater without DTT (recovery = 17.4 {+/-} 0.4%). The method limit of detection (MLOD) for ASCV-2 recovered from pre-filtered wastewater was determined to be 4.6x104 GU L-1 (95% degree of confidence). Using this optimized magnetic bead-based extraction protocol, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was verified in wastewater collected from sewershed locations in Atlantic Canada. This emerging RNA extraction method is direct, rapid, and does not require the use of specialized equipment, thus offering advantageous application for laboratories with limited resources. As such, this method is an indispensable tool in the monitoring of wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 to potentially understand COVID-19 infection occurrence within communities and inform public health leaders.","Parra Guardado, A.

Their functional roles include the hydrolysis of several biologically active peptides and growth factors and some have proved to be of diagnostic and prognostic value in leukaemia. These enzymes may also be found in serum as a consequence of non-haematopoietic related diseases and so have been used as indicators of liver damage. Haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow go through a process of growth and differentiation before being released into the peripheral circulation where they fulfill many functional roles. The enzyme activities of some aminopeptidases have been shown to modulate the growth of these cells. In addition, the activities of these enzymes themselves can be regulated by haematopoietic growth factors. However, the mechanisms that regulate their expression and activity are not fully understood.

Some calves had high Hp concentrations at week 3, but AGP concentrations did not rise during respiratory disease. Higher SAA, LBP and Hp concentrations at a later stage of BRD (week 3) were associated with the low BRSV-specific IgG(1) production, suggesting that these calves had enhanced inflammatory response to the secondary bacterial infection.

New designs with a focus on health and safety began to appear at the end of the twentieth century. There has been an important interaction between the design of the laboratory and chemical practice, including how chemistry was taught.

620325,The Bayesian Design of Adaptive Clinical Trials,2021-01-10,"BACKGROUND: Initial reports in May 2009 of the novel influenza strain H1N1pdm estimated a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.6%, similar to that of seasonal influenza. In July 2009, however, Argentina reported 3056 cases with 137 deaths, representing a CFR of 4.5%. Potential explanations for increased CFR included virus reassortment or genetic drift, or infection of a more vulnerable population. Virus genomic sequencing of 26 Argentinian samples representing both severe and mild disease indicated no evidence of reassortment, mutations associated with resistance to antiviral drugs, or genetic drift that might contribute to virulence. Furthermore, no evidence was found for increased frequency of risk factors for H1N1pdm disease. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined nasopharyngeal swab samples (NPS) from 199 cases of H1N1pdm infection from Argentina with MassTag PCR, testing for 33 additional microbial agents. The study population consisted of 199 H1N1pdm-infected subjects sampled between 23 June and 4 July 2009. Thirty-nine had severe disease defined as death (n = 20) or hospitalization (n = 19); 160 had mild disease. At least one additional agent of potential pathogenic importance was identified in 152 samples (76%), including Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 62); Haemophilus influenzae (n = 104); human respiratory syncytial virus A (n = 11) and B (n = 1); human rhinovirus A (n = 1) and B (n = 4); human coronaviruses 229E (n = 1) and OC43 (n = 2); Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2); Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2); Serratia marcescens (n = 1); and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 35) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, n = 6). The presence of S. pneumoniae was strongly correlated with severe disease. S. pneumoniae was present in 56.4% of severe cases versus 25% of mild cases; more than one-third of H1N1pdm NPS with S. pneumoniae were from subjects with severe disease (22 of 62 S. pneumoniae-positive NPS, p = 0.0004). In subjects 6 to 55 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of severe disease in the presence of S. pneumoniae was 125.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.95, 928.72; p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The association of S. pneumoniae with morbidity and mortality is established in the current and previous influenza pandemics. However, this study is the first to demonstrate the prognostic significance of non-invasive antemortem diagnosis of S. pneumoniae infection and may provide insights into clinical management.","Palacios, Gustavo; Hornig, Mady; Cisterna, Daniel; Savji, Nazir; Bussetti, Ana Valeria; Kapoor, Vishal; Hui, Jeffrey; Tokarz, Rafal; Briese, Thomas; Baumeister, Elsa; Lipkin, W.

Among other potential pathogens, we identified one novel orthobunyavirus, tentatively named Nyangole virus, from the blood of a child diagnosed with malaria and pneumonia, and Bwamba orthobunyavirus in the nasopharynx of a child with rash and sepsis. We also identified two novel human rhinovirus C species. This exploratory pilot study demonstrates the utility of mNGS and the IDseq platform for defining the molecular landscape of febrile infectious diseases in resource limited areas. These methods, supported by a robust data analysis and sharing platform, offer a new tool for the surveillance, diagnosis, and ultimately treatment and prevention of infectious diseases.","Ramesh, Akshaya; Nakielny, Sara; Hsu, Jennifer; Kyohere, Mary; Byaruhanga, Oswald; Bourcy, Charles de; Egger, Rebecca; Dimitrov, Boris; Juan, Yun-Fang; Sheu, Jonathan; Wang, James; Kalantar, Katrina; Langelier, Charles; Ruel, Theodore; Mpimbaza, Arthur; Wilson, Michael R.; Rosenthal, Philip J.; DeRisi, Joseph L.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/385005,282

However, regarding children, making immunisation a stand-alone issue cuts across integrated child health services. Most initiatives, including the 10 Action Points from the 2019 European-hosted Global Vaccination Summit, are all laudable but high level enablement policies. Delivery processes have been ignored, and key stakeholders not involved in discussions. METHODS: Reviews of policies, literature and planned actions, leading to identification of further delivery policies needed to facilitate and stimulate practical accomplishments. RESULTS: 10 aspects are identified where European coordinated action to develop policies, share evidence and increase standards, would be beneficial. These also fit in with established European Commission strengths, and the incoming Commission's policies and priorities. CONCLUSION: The European Commission, Member States and child health stakeholders should pursue a holistic approach, taking immunisation as a component of integrated child health. Service delivery should be compatible with modern societal challenges and related parenting patterns, and public health processes modernised and reinvigorated. Nursing and societal stakeholders should be brought in, and fit-for-purpose digital support facilitated. This is even more urgent following the diversion of the Covid-19 pandemic.","Rigby, Michael J",Int. j. health plann. manage,https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34254365/,282

An indirect search for a protein structure to be used as a template for 3D modelling has been performed on the basis of the genomic organisation similarity generally exhibited by coronaviruses. The crystal structure of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin B appeared to be structurally adaptable to human and canine coronavirus spike protein sequences and it was successfully used to model the two subunits of SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein. The overall shape and the surface hydrophobicity of the two subunits in the obtained models suggest the localisation of the most relevant regions for their activity.","Spiga, Ottavia; Bernini, Andrea; Ciutti, Arianna; Chiellini, Stefano; Menciassi, Nicola; Finetti, Francesca; Causarono, Vincenza; Anselmi, Francesca; Prischi, Filippo; Niccolai, Neri",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X03017340; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X03017340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14511651/,282

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Written surveys were mailed to a random sample of residents in Olmsted County, Minnesota, in 2015 and 2019 including the 5-item World Health Organization Well-being Index (0-100; for which 100 is the best imaginable well-being or quality of life). Multivariable hierarchical regression was used to evaluate the association between well-being and demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, and environmental factors. RESULTS: The survey was returned by 1232 of 4000 individuals (response rate, 30.80%). The average well-being score was 70.02. Impaired well-being was identified in 223/1187 individuals (18.79%). Adjusted regression models showed that impaired well-being was independently associated with household poverty, financial stress, reduced access to medical or mental health care, ever having depression diagnosed, living in an unsafe community, or being socially isolated. CONCLUSION: One in 5 people in a county in the US Midwest have impaired well-being. Well-being was associated with several modifiable factors.

Understanding children's views on COVID-19 and related restrictions on their lives provides an important opportunity to understand how children have responded to the pandemic, including the impacts on their social and emotional well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study explored the experiences and perspectives of children in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions on everyday life. METHOD: A qualitative study using semistructured online interviews with participatory drawings was undertaken between May and July 2020. Eighteen children from England and Wales, aged 7-11 years, participated in interviews. FINDINGS: Themes included children's reflections on (1) COVID-19 as a deadly contagion; (2) fears and sadness and (3) social responsibility and opportunities to respond positively. CONCLUSIONS: Young children offer insightful reflections on their experiences during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Children and young people's perspectives must be considered in future public health discourse. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This work was informed by conversations with my own three primary school-aged children and the children of friends.

622237,Improving the Reprocessing Quality of Flexible Thermolabile Endoscopes: How to Learn from Mistakes,2021-03-03,"Publisher Summary Patient simulation offers clinical educators a new type of “canvas” where they can apply the principles of realism. While having the latest high-tech robotic patient simulators emplaced within fully functional clinical spaces is great, that alone does not provide enough realism. Naïve people are generally impressed by the mannequin and its capabilities, but the “patient” is the most artificial thing about simulation. It's more important to use the technology as a lens to focus on the human aspect of interactions. In the quest for realism, clinical educators create context by placing the mannequin in a simulated or real environment, breathe life into it with human interaction, and take advantage of the learner's imagination. To facilitate learners being more receptive to the educators, the Patient Simulation Center located at St. Michael's Hospital in downtown Toronto, Canada, always presents a supportive and nonthreatening atmosphere. It aims to provide experiential acquisition of skills and judgment, allowing lessons to be learned from errors made. Before starting, learners are familiarized to the environment and the mannequin, and provided with a set of ground rules. This is done on a need-to-know basis, being careful not to cognitively overload the learners with too many rules. There is no need to share all the capabilities and limitations of simulation or to explain how the props work. Keep it simple and user friendly. The rules will vary with the different levels of learners and with how they utilize simulation.","Chow, Roger E.; Naik, Viren N.",Clinical Simulation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123725318500200; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123725318500200,282

This study investigated the prevalence of engagement in COVID-19 preventative behaviors, predictors of these behaviors, and COVID-19-related psychological distress. One hundred and sixty-three individuals with SMIs (94 with schizophrenia spectrum illnesses and 69 with affective disorders) and 27 psychiatrically healthy comparison participants were recruited from ongoing studies across 3 sites, to complete a phone survey querying implementation of 8 specific COVID-19 preventative behaviors that participants engaged in at least once in the past month as well as standard assessments of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, loneliness, and coping. Data were collected between 3 April 2020 and 4 June 2020. The large majority of our SMI sample, which consisted of outpatients with relatively mild symptom severity, endorsed engaging in multiple preventative behaviors. Relatively few differences were found between groups; however, individuals with SMI were less likely to work remotely than healthy individuals and individuals with schizophrenia spectrum illness were less likely to stay home as a preventative measure, wear face masks, and work remotely than individuals with affective disorders. Differences in staying home remained after controlling for potential confounds. Although individuals with SMI reported more psychological distress related to COVID-19, this distress was largely unrelated to engagement in preventative behaviors. The large majority of individuals with SMI in this outpatient sample, regardless of broad diagnostic category, reported performing multiple behaviors intended to prevent COVID-19 infection at least once a month and reported distress associated with the pandemic. These findings suggest a good level of awareness of COVID-19 among stable outpatients with SMI. The degree to which more acutely ill persons with SMI engage in such preventative behaviors, however, remains to be examined.","Pinkham, Amy E.; Ackerman, Robert A.; Depp, Colin A.; Harvey, Philip D.; Moore, Raeanne C.",NPJ Schizophr,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41537-021-00136-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33536446/,282

METHODS: A 50-year-old male presented to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea and confirmed COVID-19. He developed hypoxic respiratory failure and heart failure, requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Mobility was limited by severe impairments in strength, endurance, balance, and cognition. The referral, screening, and rehabilitation of this patient was guided by a COVID-19 Service Delivery Plan designed to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of care delivery while minimizing staff exposure to the virus. Coordinated physical and occupational therapy sessions focused on progressive mobility and cognitive retraining. Progress was monitored using a series of standardized outcome measures, including the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AMPAC), Timed “Up and Go” (TUG), and the Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) examination. RESULTS: Rehabilitation was initiated on day 18, and the patient participated in 19 treatment sessions, each approximately 30 minutes, over the remaining 30 days of his hospital stay. His AM-PAC mobility and function scores both improved from 100% to 0% disability, he experienced substantial improvements in both TUG (Δ = 4.2 s) and SLUMS (discharge score = 25), and there were no adverse events. He was discharged to home with his family and home rehabilitation services. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 contributed to severe declines in mobility and function in this middle-aged man. He experienced substantial gains in his function, mobility, and cognition during his in-hospital rehabilitation, which was guided by a facility-wide plan to prevent virus transmission. IMPACT: The rehabilitation of individuals with severe COVID-19 presents significant challenges, both at the level of the individual patient and the whole facility.

The aim of the present work was to study if maternal IgG1 antibodies (Abs) to BCoV acquired by colostrum intake modulate the development of BCoV infection in calves reared in a dairy farm in Argentina. Thirty Holstein calves were monitored during their first 60 days of age. Animals were classified into two groups depending on their initial BCoV IgG1 Ab titers. The “failure of passive transfer” (FPT) group had significantly lower IgG1 Abs to BCoV than the “acceptable passive transfer” (APT) group of calves (log10 1.98 vs. 3.38 respectively) (p < 0.0001). These differences were also observed when the total protein levels in both groups were compared (p = 0.0081). Moreover, 71% (5/7) of calves from the FPT group showed IgG1 seroconversion to BCoV compared to 29.4% (5/17) of animals from the APT group. Regarding viral circulation, BCoV was detected in 10% (3/30) of all calves and BCoV IgG1 Ab seroconversion was detected in 42% of the total animals showing that almost half of the calves were infected with BCoV. In conclusion, calves with high titers of specific BCoV IgG1 (≥1024) were mostly protected against viral infection, while animals with low titers of IgG1 (<1024) were mostly infected with BCoV. IgG1 Abs from colostrum origin are critical for prevention of BCoV infection.","Bok, Marina; Alassia, Martín; Frank, Flavia; Vega, Celina G.; Wigdorovitz, Andrés; Parreño, Viviana",Rev Argent Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ram.2017.03.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0325754117300913; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28893529/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0325754117300913,282

625402,Alice in Suicideland: Exploring the Suicidal Ideation Mechanism through the Sense of Connectedness and Help-Seeking Behaviors,2021-04-01,"We study the effects of two mechanisms which increase the efficacy of contact-tracing applications (CTAs) such as the mobile phone contact-tracing applications that have been used during the COVID-19 epidemic. The first mechanism is the introduction of user referrals. We compare four scenarios for the uptake of CTAs—(1) the p% of individuals that use the CTA are chosen randomly, (2) a smaller initial set of randomly-chosen users each refer a contact to use the CTA, achieving p% in total, (3) a small initial set of randomly-chosen users each refer around half of their contacts to use the CTA, achieving p% in total, and (4) for comparison, an idealised scenario in which the p% of the population that uses the CTA is the p% with the most contacts. Using agent-based epidemiological models incorporating a geometric space, we find that, even when the uptake percentage p% is small, CTAs are an effective tool for mitigating the spread of the epidemic in all scenarios. Moreover, user referrals significantly improve efficacy. In addition, it turns out that user referrals reduce the quarantine load. The second mechanism for increasing the efficacy of CTAs is tuning the severity of quarantine measures. Our modelling shows that using CTAs with mild quarantine measures is effective in reducing the maximum hospital load and the number of people who become ill, but leads to a relatively high quarantine load, which may cause economic disruption. Fortunately, under stricter quarantine measures, the advantages are maintained but the quarantine load is reduced. Our models incorporate geometric inhomogeneous random graphs to study the effects of the presence of super-spreaders and of the absence of long-distant contacts (e.g., through travel restrictions) on our conclusions.","Goldberg, Leslie Ann; Jorritsma, Joost; Komjáthy, Júlia; Lapinskas, John",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34010333/,282

The coronavirus spike protein, an enveloped glycoprotein essential for viral entry, belongs to the class I fusion proteins and is characterized by the presence of two heptad repeat (HR) regions, HR1 and HR2. These two regions are understood to form a fusion-active conformation similar to those of other typical viral fusion proteins. This hairpin structure likely juxtaposes the viral and cellular membranes, thus facilitating membrane fusion and subsequent viral entry. The fusion core protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein was crystallized, and the structure was determined at 2.8 Å of resolution. The fusion core is a six-helix bundle with three HR2 helices packed against the hydrophobic grooves on the surface of central coiled coil formed by three parallel HR1 helices in an oblique antiparallel manner. This structure shares significant similarity with the fusion core structure of mouse hepatitis virus spike protein and other viral fusion proteins, suggesting a conserved mechanism of membrane fusion. Drug discovery strategies aimed at inhibiting viral entry by blocking hairpin formation, which have been successfully used in human immunodeficiency virus 1 inhibitor development, may be applicable to the inhibition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus on the basis of structural information provided here. The relatively deep grooves on the surface of the central coiled coil will be a good target site for the design of viral fusion inhibitors.","Xu, Yanhui; Lou, Zhiyong; Liu, Yiwei; Pang, Hai; Tien, Po; Gao, George F.; Rao, Zihe",J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15345712/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925819323361; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819323361,282
626892,Food Security Characteristics Vary for Undergraduate and Graduate Students at a Midwest University,2021-05-26,"The ability of cyclodextrins to enhance the antiviral activity of a phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide has been investigated. Aff18-mer oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to the initiation region of the mRNA coding for the spike protein and containing the intergenic consensus sequence of an enteric coronavirus has been tested for antiviral action against virus growth in human adenocarcinoma cells. The phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide only showed a limited effect on virus growth rate (from 12 to 34% viral inhibition in cells treated with 7.5 to 25 μM oligodeoxynucleotide, respectively, at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 infectious particle per cell). In the same conditions, the phosphorothioate analogue exhibited stronger antiviral activity, the inhibition increased from 56 to 90%. The inhibitory effect of this analogue was antisense and sequence-specific. Northern blot analysis showed that the sequence-dependent mechanism of action appears to be the inhibition of mRNA transcription. We conclude that the coronavirus intergenic consensus sequence is a good target for an antisense oligonucleotide antiviral action. The properties of the phosphodiester oligonucleotide was improved after its complexation with cyclodextrins. The most important increase of the antiviral activity (90% inhibition) was obtained with only 7.5 μM oligonucleotide complexed to a cyclodextrin derivative, 6-deoxy-6-S-β-D-galactopyranosyl-6-thio-cyclomaltoheptaose in a molar ratio of 1:100. These studies suggest that the use of cyclodextrin derivatives as carrier for phosphodiester oligonucleotides delivery may be an effective method for increasing the therapeutic potential of these compounds in viral infections.","Abdou, S.; Collomb, J.; Sallas, F.; Marsura, A.; Finance, C.",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9672621/,282

Currently, ARDS is treated with supportive measures, but regenerative medicine approaches including extracellular vesicle (EV)-based therapies have shown promise. Herein, we aimed to analyse whether EV-based therapies could be effective in treating severe pulmonary conditions that affect COVID-19 patients and to understand their relevance for an eventual therapeutic application to human patients. Using a defined search strategy, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and found 39 articles (2014–2020) that reported effects of EVs, mainly derived from stem cells, in lung injury models (one large animal study, none in human). EV treatment resulted in: (1) attenuation of inflammation (reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltration, M2 macrophage polarization); (2) regeneration of alveolar epithelium (decreased apoptosis and stimulation of surfactant production); (3) repair of microvascular permeability (increased endothelial cell junction proteins); (4) prevention of fibrosis (reduced fibrin production). These effects were mediated by the release of EV cargo and identified factors including miRs-126, −30b-3p, −145, −27a-3p, syndecan-1, hepatocyte growth factor and angiopoietin-1. This review indicates that EV-based therapies hold great potential for COVID-19 related lung injuries as they target multiple pathways and enhance tissue regeneration. However, before translating EV therapies into human clinical trials, efforts should be directed at developing good manufacturing practice solutions for EVs and testing optimal dosage and administration route in large animal models.","Khalaj, Kasra; Figueira, Rebeca Lopes; Antounians, Lina; Lauriti, Giuseppe; Zani, Augusto",Journal of extracellular vesicles,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32944185/; https://doi.org/10.1080/20013078.2020.1795365,282

High-speed images of the eye subjected to air puff tonometry (glaucoma detection) reveal three-dimensional, spatiotemporal interaction between the puff and tear film. The interaction finally leads to the rupture and breakup of the tear film culminating into sub-millimeter sized droplet projectiles traveling at speeds of 0.2 m/s. The calculated droplet spread radius ([Formula: see text] 0.5 m) confirms the likelihood of the procedure to generate droplets that may disperse in air as well as splash on instruments, raising the potential of infection. We provide a detailed physical exposition of the entire procedure using high fidelity experiments and theoretical modeling. We conclude that air puff induced corneal deformation and subsequent capillary waves lead to flow instabilities (Rayleigh–Taylor, Rayleigh–Plateau) that lead to tear film ejection, expansion, stretching, and subsequent droplet formation.","Roy, Durbar; M, Sophia; Rasheed, Abdur; Kabi, Prasenjit; Roy, Abhijit Sinha; Shetty, Rohit; Basu, Saptarshi",Phys Fluids (1994),https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01228v2.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34552316/; https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0061956,282

The use of middle censoring scheme has been shown to be very appropriate under the COVID-19 pandemic scenario. Cause-specific quantile inference under middle censoring is employed. Such quantile inferences are obtained through cumulative incidence function based on cause-specific proportional hazards model. The baseline lifetime is assumed to follow a very general parametric model namely the Weibull distribution, and is independent of the censoring mechanism. We obtain estimates of the unknown parameters and cause specific quantile functions under classical as well as a Bayesian set-up.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study examined 100 samples of Domiati, Tallaga, Cheddar, and Ras cheese collected from several shops and supermarkets. Samples were spread on selective media to isolate bacterial strains. Molecular characterization of bacterial isolates was carried out using polymerase chain reaction to determine Shiga toxin 1 (stx1), Shiga toxin 2 (stx2), eaeA, and nuc genes. The isolates were tested for susceptibility to 14 antibiotics by disk diffusion assay. RESULTS: In this study, several E. coli serotypes were identified. E. coli O26:H11, O103:H2, and O111:H2 expressed stx1/2, E. coli O114:H4 expressed stx1, E. coli O17:H18, O21:H7 and O146:H21 expressed stx2, while only E. coli O26:H11 and O111:H2 expressed eaeA. The E. coli isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic, while most isolates (82.4%) showed multidrug resistance (MDR). AMR to erythromycin was the highest (100%), followed by nalidixic acid (94.1%), cefotaxime (82.4%), vancomycin and cephalothin (64.7%), penicillin G (52.9%), sulfamethoxazole (47.1%), amikacin and kanamycin (35.3%), ampicillin (29.4%), tetracycline and ciprofloxacin (23.5%), and doxycycline (11.8%), while gentamicin showed the least resistance (5.9%). The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index of the isolated E. coli ranged from 0.071 to 1 (mean = 0.478). All S. aureus isolates expressed the nuc gene and demonstrated resistance to at least one antibiotic, and 90% of isolates were MDR. AMR to kanamycin and cephalothin was the highest (100%), followed by penicillin (90%), doxycycline (70%), nalidixic acid and sulfamethoxazole (60%), erythromycin (50%), tetracycline, cefotaxime, and gentamicin (40%), ciprofloxacin and ampicillin (30%), and amikacin (20%). In comparison, vancomycin showed the least resistance (10%). MAR index of isolated S. aureus ranged from 0.143 to 1 (mean = 0.529). CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial-resistant E. coli and S. aureus are potential risks for public health and may have a role in disseminating AMR to other pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes.","Kasem, Nahed Gomaa; Al-Ashmawy, Maha; Elsherbini, Mohammed; Abdelkhalek, Adel",J Adv Vet Anim Res,https://doi.org/10.5455/javar.2021.h509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34395595/,282

This study assessed the COVID-19 pandemic impact on domestic violence, genital tract health, menstruation, and contraception use among 200 women in Jordan using a self-validated survey questionnaire. The questionnaire was structured to compare frequencies of domestic violence, reproductive tract infections, menstrual irregularities, and contraception use, type, source, and replacement during or after total curfew in Jordan with 6-months before the pandemic; 20.5% of women suffered from increased domestic abuse during the COVID-19 pandemic. Incidence of menstrual problems and genital tract infections was significantly reduced during total curfew compared with 6 months prior (10.5% versus 17.5%; P = 0.016 and 19% versus 25.5%; P = 0.041, respectively). Pre-pandemic state of menstrual problems and genital tract infections was resumed after total curfew. During total curfew, phone consultations were significantly increased (17.5% versus 8.5%; P = 0.01), whereas visiting clinics was significantly reduced (23% versus 5.5%; P = 0.000) to manage menstruation or birth canal infections. Contraception use during total curfew significantly decreased compared with prior (59.5% versus 65.5%; P = 0.017).

However, recent observations raised concerns about potential post-viral severe inflammatory reactions in children infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We describe an outbreak of cases of Kawasaki disease (KD) admitted between April 27 and May 7, 2020, in the general paediatrics department of a university hospital in Paris, France. All children prospectively underwent nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing, and echocardiography. The number of admissions for KD during the study period was compared to that observed since January 1, 2018, based on discharge codes, using Poisson regression. Results: A total of 17 children were admitted for KD over an 11-day period, in contrast with a mean of 1.0 case per 2-week period over 2018-2019 (Poisson incidence rate ratio: 13.2 [95% confidence interval: 7.3-24.1], p <0.001). Their median age was 7.5 (range, 3.7-16.6) years, and 59% of patients originated from sub-Saharan Africa or Caribbean islands. Eleven patients presented with KD shock syndrome (KDSS) requiring intensive care support, and 12 had myocarditis. All children had marked gastrointestinal symptoms at the early stage of illness and high levels of inflammatory markers. Fourteen patients (82%) had evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR 7/17, positive IgG antibody detection 14/16). All patients received immunoglobulins and some received corticosteroids (5/17). The clinical outcome was favourable in all patients. Moderate coronary artery dilations were detected in 5 cases (29%) during hospitalisation. Conclusions: The ongoing outbreak of KD in the Paris might be related to SARS-CoV2, and shows an unusually high proportion of children with gastrointestinal involvement, KDSS and African ancestry.","Toubiana, J.; Poirault, C.; Corsia, A.; Bajolle, F.; Fourgeaud, J.; Angoulvant, F.; Debray, A.; Basmaci, R.; Salvador, E.; Biscardi, S.; Frange, P.; Chalumeau, M.; Casanova, J.-L.; Cohen, J.

In this regard, one of the most widely studied drugs is Favipiravir. Our aim in this paper is to conduct comprehensive research based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT) on the potential of metallofullerenes as suitable drug carriers. The surface interaction of Favipiravir with organometallic compound resulted by doping of the five transition metals of the first row of the periodic table (Ti, Cr, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Zn) was examined in depth to select the most suitable metallofullerenes. First, the adsorption geometries of Favipiravir drug onto each metallofullerene were deeply investigated. It was found that Cr-, Fe-, Ni-doped fullerenes provide the excellent adsorbent property with adsorption energies of -148.2, -149.6, -146.6 kJ/mol, respectively. The Infrared spectroscopy (IR) study was conducted to survey the stretching vibration of bonds involving in the systems, specialty the C=O in the drug, C-M in the metallofullerene, and M-O in the metallofullerene-drug complex.

As these systems got overwhelmed with the emergency care of the infected patients, widespread cancellations of elective surgery occurred. Our hospital utilised local private hospital as a dedicated cold site (CS) for urgent elective surgery during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to analyse the outcomes at this dedicated cold site. METHOD: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all the cases operated at the CS during a 2-month period (30 March 2020 to 29 May 2020) was carried out. The primary outcome was 30-day COVID-19 related mortality. The secondary outcomes were 30-day non-COVID-19 related mortality, complications, readmission and development of COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 153 patients were operated on at the CS over the study period with a median age of 57 years (Interquartile range, IQR 47–70). 62% were females and 82% had a Body Mass Index (BMI) less than 30.73% of the operations were performed for cancer. 59% of the surgeries were graded as intermediate and 26% as major or complex. There was no mortality at 30 days from COVID-19 or non COVID-19 causes. There was only 1 (0.65%) readmission. 7 patients (4.57%) developed complications. 1 (0.65%) patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 in the postoperative period while 3 had COVID-19 symptoms but were tested negative.

A previous study showed increased sickness-related absences among municipality employees during the Icelandic economic crisis in 2008. This led to the following research questions: has bullying and/or harassment increased between the time points of the study up to seven years after the crisis? Did bullying and/or harassment change depending on downsizing? Are quantitative job demands, role conflicts and social support connected to bullying and/or harassment at work and if so, how? The study is based on a four-wave longitudinal balanced panel dataset consisting of those who work within the education and care services operated by Icelandic municipalities. It was seen that bullying and harassment had increased between the time points of the study. Furthermore, employees in downsized workplaces, workplaces with higher quantitative job demands, more role conflicts and less support were more likely to experience bullying and/or harassment than employees in other workplaces. Since the effects may prevail for several years, the study demonstrates that the consequences of downsizing need to be carefully considered and that managers must be supported in that role. As economic crises tend to occur periodically, presently due to COVID-19, the knowledge is both of theoretical and practical importance.","Sigursteinsdottir, Hjordis; Rafnsdottir, Gudbjorg Linda; Jonsdottir, Gudbjorg Andrea",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33008097/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17197180,282

Analysis of data from the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak in Kuwait can provide important information about the potential epidemic and healthcare burdens as well as assist in evaluating the potential impact of various outbreak control measures. Such control measures are essentially implemented to achieve a sufficient reduction in the effective reproduction number during an outbreak. In this study, we use a mathematical modeling framework to simulate the outbreak dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kuwait and forecast the potential burden on the healthcare system. We calibrate the model against daily numbers of detected infection and death cases using a maximum likelihood framework and estimate both the basic and effective reproduction numbers. Our results indicate that the early control measures implemented in Kuwait had the effect of delaying the intensity of the outbreak but were unsuccessful in reducing Rt below 1. This highlights a need for a systematic investigation of the current public health interventions as well as a scientific surveillance tool that is sufficiently sensitive to outbreak temporal dynamics. Meanwhile, the developed model can serve as a public health tool to control the current outbreak and can be used to anticipate effective measures should a second wave re-emerge in Kuwait.","Al-Shammari, Abdullah A.

It may cause acute respiratory failure ranging from severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome to exacerbations of airflow limitation. Non-invasive ventilation is now considered first-line intervention for different causes of acute respiratory failure and may be considered in the context of H1N1 pandemic. Although infection control issues have been arisen, non-invasive ventilation was effective and safe during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Asia. It is reasonable to recommend non-invasive ventilation in H1N1-related exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases, especially in negative-pressure wards. Treatment of early Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome associated with H1N1 using non-invasive ventilation could be tried rapidly identifying those who fail without delaying endotracheal intubation. Considering the high demand for critical care beds during the pandemic, non-invasive ventilation may have a role in reducing the estimated load.","Winck, João Carlos; Gonçalves, Miguel",Revista Portuguesa de Pneumologia (English Edition),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2173511510700087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288976/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2173511510700087; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2173-5115(10)70008-7,282

In this study, in relation to the pandemic, psychological distress, sleep quality and affecting factors in adults were examined. METHODS: Using the convenience sampling method, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and questionnaires to determine psychological distress levels and sociodemographic characteristics were distributed online to 405 participants. RESULTS: The mean psychological distress score of the participants was 34.55 ± 8.07, while their mean sleep quality score was 6.39 ± 3.31. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was 55.1%. The psychological distress scores were higher among the men than the women, married participants than single ones, those with children than those without children and those who were employed than those who were not. The sleep quality of the single participants and the participants with low education levels was poorer. The sleep quality of those who left work in the pandemic period was poorer than those who were working from home/office and those who were already not employed before the pandemic. The sleep quality of those not working in the field of health was better than healthcare professionals and those not working at all. The scores for psychological distress were positively correlated with gender and negatively correlated with sleep quality levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on the psychological distress and sleep quality of adults.

In adults, compelling evidence exists indicating that an uncontrolled inflammatory response (""cytokine storm"") is pivotal in determining disease progression and mortality. Children may rarely present with severe disease. Modulating factors related to the host's genetic factors, age‐related susceptibility, and the capability to mount appropriate immune responses might play a role in control virus load at an early stage and regulating the inflammatory reaction.

We aimed to perform a meta-analysis to describe the accuracy of available tests to detect COVID-19 in Brazil. We searched at the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) online platform to describe the pooled sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and summary receiver operating characteristic curves (SROC) for detection of IgM/IgG antibodies and for tests using naso/oropharyngeal swabs in the random-effects models. We identified 16 tests registered, mostly rapid-tests. Pooled diagnostic accuracy measures [95%CI] were: (i) for IgM antibodies Se=82% [76-87]; Sp=97% [96-98]; DOR=168 [92-305] and SROC=0.98 [0.96-0.99]; (ii) for IgG antibodies Se=97% [90-99]; Sp=98% [97-99]; DOR=1994 [385-10334] and SROC=0.99 [0.98-1.00]; and (iii) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by antigen or molecular assays in naso/oropharyngeal swabs Se=97% [85-99]; Sp=99% [77-100]; DOR=2649 [30-233056] and SROC=0.99 [0.98-1.00]. These tests can be helpful for emergency testing during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. However, it is important to highlight the high rate of false negative results from tests which detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies in the initial course of the disease and the scarce evidence-based validation results published in Brazil. Future studies addressing the diagnostic performance of tests for COVID-19 in the Brazilian population are urgently needed.","Castro, Rodolfo; Luz, Paula M; Wakimoto, Mayumi D; Veloso, Valdilea G; Grinsztejn, Beatriz; Perazzo, Hugo",The Brazilian journal of infectious diseases : an official publication of the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330437/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1413867020300295?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjid.2020.04.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1413867020300295,282
635347,Access to Healthcare during COVID-19,2021-03-14,"BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic carriers were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) without developing symptoms, which might be a potential source of infection outbreak. Here, we aim to clarify the epidemiologic and influencing factors of asymptomatic carriers in the general population. METHODS: In our hospital, all hospital staff have received throat swab RT-PCR test, plasma COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibodies test and chest CT examination. We analyzed the correlation between infection rates and gender, age, job position, work place and COVID-19 knowledge training of the staff. After that, all asymptomatic staff were re-examined weekly for 3 weeks. FINDINGS: A total of 3764 hospital staff were included in this single-center cross-sectional study. Among them, 126 hospital staff had abnormal findings, and the proportion of asymptomatic infection accounted for 0.76% (28/3674). There were 26 staff with IgM+, 73 with IgG+, and 40 with ground glass shadow of chest CT. Of all staff with abnormal findings, the older they are, the more likely they are to be the staff with abnormal results, regardless of their gender. Of 3674 hospital staff, the positive rate of labor staff is obviously higher than that of health care workers (HCWs) and administrative staff (P<0.05). In the course of participating in the treatment of COVID-19, there was no statistically significant difference in positive rates between high-risk departments and low-risk departments (P>0.05). The positive rate of HCWs who participated in the COVID-19 knowledge training was lower than those did not participate in early training (P <0.01). Importantly, it was found that there was no statistical difference between the titers of IgM antibody of asymptomatic infections and confirmed patients with COVID-19 in recovery period (P>0.05). During 3 weeks follow-up, all asymptomatic patients did not present the development of clinical symptoms or radiographic abnormalities after active intervention in isolation point. INTERPRETATION: To ensure the safety of resumption of work, institutions should conduct COVID-19 prevention training for staff and screening for asymptomatic patients, and take quarantine measures as soon as possible in areas with high density of population.

In the context of lessons learned, moving forward some of what was previously routine could remain reserved for more exceptional circumstances. In order to determine what is “routine”, what is “essential”, and what is “exceptional” it is necessary to view medical decisions within the paradigm of high-quality care.

Disease severity is associated with age and comorbidities. Understanding of viral infectious mechanisms, and antibody immune response, can help to better control disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 has a major impact on the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS), through its binding to the membrane cellular glycoprotein, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2), then infecting cells for replication. This report hypothesizes the possible implication of an autoimmune response, induced by generation of allo- or autoantibodies to ACE-2, or to its complexes with viral spike protein.

636853,Achieving the ambitious targets of the Paris Agreement: the role of key actors,2021-02-26,"A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing lethal acute respiratory disease emerged in December 2019. The World Health Organization named this disease “COVID-19” and declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Many studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their exosomes (MSCs-Exo), which are isolated from allogenic bone marrow stem cells, significantly lower the risk of alveolar inflammation and other pathological conditions associated with distinct lung injuries. For example, in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia patients, MSCs-Exo and MSCs provide similar healing properties and some clinical trials have used cell-based inhalation therapy which show great promise. MSCs and MSCs-Exo have shown potential in clinical trials as a therapeutic tool for severely affected COVID-19 patients when compared to other cell-based therapies, which may face challenges like the cells' sticking to the respiratory tract epithelia during administration. However, the use of MSCs or MSCs-Exo for treating COVID-19 should strictly adhere to the appropriate manufacturing practices, quality control measurements, preclinical safety and efficacy data, and the proper ethical regulations.

Current preparedness activities recognize the importance of oral antivirals and recommend therapeutics with different mechanisms of action. Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is closely related to VARV, causing a highly similar clinical human disease, and can be used as a surrogate for smallpox antiviral testing. The prairie dog MPXV model has been characterized and used to study the efficacy of antipoxvirus therapeutics, including recently approved TPOXX (tecovirimat). Brincidofovir (BCV; CMX001) has shown antiviral activity against double-stranded DNA viruses, including poxviruses. To determine the exposure of BCV following oral administration to prairie dogs, a pharmacokinetics (PK) study was performed. Analysis of BCV plasma concentrations indicated variability, conceivably due to the outbred nature of the animals. To determine BCV efficacy in the MPXV prairie dog model, groups of animals were intranasally challenged with 9 × 10(5) plaque-forming units (PFU; 90% lethal dose [LD(90)]) of MPXV on inoculation day 0 (ID0). Animals were divided into groups based on the first day of BCV treatment relative to inoculation day (ID–1, ID0, or ID1). A trend in efficacy was noted dependent upon treatment initiation (57% on ID–1, 43% on ID0, and 29% on ID1) but was lower than demonstrated in other animal models. Analysis of the PK data indicated that BCV plasma exposure (maximum concentration [C(max)]) and the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC(last)) were lower than in other animal models administered the same doses, indicating that suboptimal BCV exposure may explain the lower protective effect on survival. IMPORTANCE Preparedness activities against highly transmissible viruses with high mortality rates have been highlighted during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Smallpox, caused by variola virus (VARV) infection, is highly transmissible, with an estimated 30% mortality. Through an intensive vaccination campaign, smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, and routine smallpox vaccination of individuals ceased. Today's current population has little/no immunity against VARV. If smallpox were to reemerge, the worldwide results would be devastating. Recent FDA approval of one smallpox antiviral (tecovirimat) was a successful step in biothreat preparedness; however, orthopoxviruses can become resistant to treatment, suggesting the need for multiple therapeutics. Our paper details the efficacy of the investigational smallpox drug brincidofovir in a monkeypox virus (MPXV) animal model. Since brincidofovir has not been tested in vivo against smallpox, studies with the related virus MPXV are critical in understanding whether it would be protective in the event of a smallpox outbreak.","Hutson, Christina L.; Kondas, Ashley V.; Mauldin, Mathew R.; Doty, Jeffrey B.; Grossi, Irma M.; Morgan, Clint N.; Ostergaard, Sharon Dietz; Hughes, Christine M.; Nakazawa, Yoshinori; Kling, Chantal; Martin, Brock E.; Ellison, James A.; Carroll, Darin D.; Gallardo-Romero, Nadia F.; Olson, Victoria A.",mSphere,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33536322/; https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00927-20,282
636948,Types of Perception of Home Visiting Oral Health Care Services for Korean Older Persons: A Q Methodology Study,2020-12-30,"BACKGROUND: As of May 9, 2021, the United States had 32.7 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 (20.7% of confirmed cases worldwide) and 580,000 deaths (17.7% of deaths worldwide). Early on in the pandemic, widespread social, financial, and mental insecurities led to extreme and irrational coping behaviors, such as panic buying. However, despite the consistent spread of COVID-19 transmission, the public began to violate public safety measures as the pandemic got worse. OBJECTIVE: In this work, we examine the effect of fear-inducing news articles on people’s expression of anxiety on Twitter. Additionally, we investigate desensitization to fear-inducing health news over time, despite the steadily rising COVID-19 death toll. METHODS: This study examined the anxiety levels in news articles (n=1465) and corresponding user tweets containing “COVID,” “COVID-19,” “pandemic,” and “coronavirus” over 11 months, then correlated that information with the death toll of COVID-19 in the United States. RESULTS: Overall, tweets that shared links to anxious articles were more likely to be anxious (odds ratio [OR] 2.65, 95% CI 1.58-4.43, P<.001). These odds decreased (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.2-0.83, P=.01) when the death toll reached the third quartile and fourth quartile (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.21-0.85, P=.01). However, user tweet anxiety rose rapidly with articles when the death toll was low and then decreased in the third quartile of deaths (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.37-1.01, P=.06). As predicted, in addition to the increasing death toll being matched by a lower level of article anxiety, the extent to which article anxiety elicited user tweet anxiety decreased when the death count reached the second quartile. CONCLUSIONS: The level of anxiety in users’ tweets increased sharply in response to article anxiety early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, but as the casualty count climbed, news articles seemingly lost their ability to elicit anxiety among readers. Desensitization offers an explanation for why the increased threat is not eliciting widespread behavioral compliance with guidance from public health officials. This work investigated how individuals' emotional reactions to news of the COVID-19 pandemic manifest as the death toll increases. Findings suggest individuals became desensitized to the increased COVID-19 threat and their emotional responses were blunted over time.","Stevens, Hannah R; Oh, Yoo Jung; Taylor, Laramie D",JMIR infodemiology,https://doi.org/10.2196/26876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34447923/,282

The analysis of the detected cases, severity, and outcomes of the cases within a country is important to have a clear picture of where the pandemic is heading and what measures should be taken to curb the infection before it becomes uncontrollable. In this manuscript, we have covered all the cases, recoveries, and deaths attributed to COVID-19 in Nepal starting from the first case on January 23 to June 21. At present, COVID-19 has spread all over Nepal with a rapid increase in the number of new cases and deaths which is very alarming in a low-income country with an inadequate health care system like Nepal. Although the government implemented an early school closure and lock-down, the management to contain COVID-19 does not appear to be adequate.

637685,Model for Taking Care of Patients with Early Childhood Caries during the SARS-Cov-2 Pandemic,2020-05-26,"A cDNA comprising the complete genome of West Nile Virus (WNV) was generated by chemical synthesis using published sequence data, independent of any preformed viral components. The synthetic WNV, produced by transfection of in vitro transcribed RNA into cell culture, exhibited undistinguishable biological properties compared to the corresponding animal-derived wild-type virus. No differences were found concerning viral growth in mammalian and insect cell lines and concerning expression of viral proteins in cells. There were also no significant differences in virulence in mice following intranasal challenge. After immunizations of mice with experimental vaccines derived from the synthetic and wild-type viruses, protection from lethal challenge was achieved with similar amounts of antigen. Both vaccine preparations also induced comparable levels of neutralizing antibodies in mice. In addition, the synthetic approach turned out to be very accurate, since the rescued WNV genome contained no undesired mutations. Thus, the first flavivirus based on chemical gene synthesis was indistinguishable from the parent virus. This demonstrates that virus isolates from animal sources are dispensable to derive seed viruses for vaccine production or research.","Orlinger, Klaus K.; Holzer, Georg W.; Schwaiger, Julia; Mayrhofer, Josef; Schmid, Karl; Kistner, Otfried; Noel Barrett, P.; Falkner, Falko G.",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.02.092; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X10002860; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X10002860; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20211218/,282

DESIGN: Both online survey and face-to-face interviews were employed in this cross-sectional study. The Household Food Security Scale and Household Dietary Diversity Score were used to access HFS and HDD, respectively. The HDD scores were derived from a 24-h recall of food intake from 12 groups. SETTING: Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: A total sample of 1876 households were recruited. RESULTS: The overall mean scores of HFS and HDD were 31·86 (sd 2·52) and 6·22 (sd 5·49), respectively. Being a rural resident, having no formal education, occupation of household head other than government job and low monthly income were potential determinants of lower HFS and HDD. Approximately 45 % and 61 % of Bangladeshi households did not get the same quantity and same type of food, respectively, as they got before the pandemic. Over 10 % of respondents reported that they lost their job or had to close their businesses, and income reduction was reported by over 70 % of household income earners during the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn was negatively associated with HFS and HDD. CONCLUSION: Household socio-economic variables and COVID-19 effects on occupation and income are potential predictors of lower HFS and HDD scores. HFS and HDD deserve more attention during this pandemic particularly with reference to low-earning households and the households whose earning persons’ occupation has been negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kundu, Satyajit; Banna, Md.

This study examined demographic, relationship, exercise, and cancer history correlates of survivors’ and their romantic partners’ couples-based exercise beliefs and their preferences for program designs. METHODS: All participants (survivors n=209, partners n=155, couples n=143) completed an online survey. Correlations and linear regression analyses were used to examine correlates of participants’ importance of and interest in couples-based exercise and their likelihood of joining a couples-based exercise program. Intraclass correlations estimated shared variance at the couple level. RESULTS: Most participants believed that couples-based exercise was highly important (51.8%) and were interested in a couples-based exercise program (61.5%), but fewer survivors believed their partner would be interested or would likely join a couples-based program. Across all outcomes, partner support for exercise was most strongly associated with participants’ couples-based exercise beliefs (r = 0.19–0.54, p<.05), and couples were significantly aligned in their beliefs (ρ=0.20–0.31, p<.01). Participants were interested in exercise programs involving exercising together (67.3%) as well as exercising separately while sharing activity data on an app or website (48.0%). CONCLUSIONS: This novel understanding of couples-based exercise beliefs provides a strong foundation upon which future exercise programs may be designed for survivors and their romantic partners. IMPACT FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Survivors’ adoption and maintenance of exercise may be enhanced by the inclusion of romantic partners in exercise programs, and partners’ inclusion is appealing to couples.","Ulrich, G.R.; Callan, S.; Ranby, K.W.",J Cancer Surviv,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11764-021-00996-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33595753/,282
637784,The Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in Taiwan: An Online Survey on Worry and Anxiety and Associated Factors,2020-10-30,"Mortality and morbidity from SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) infections in children remains low, including an exceedingly low rate of horizontal and vertical transmission. However, unforeseen complications to childhood health have emerged secondary to the pandemic. Few studies to date have examined unintended complications of the pandemic in newborns and infants. In this Commentary, we discuss the impact that COVID-19 may have on inheritance of the newborn microbiome and its assembly throughout the first years of life. In the early stages of the pandemic when vertical transmission of COVID-19 was poorly understood, several studies reported increased rates of C-sections in COVID-19 positive women. Initial recommendations discouraged COVID-19 positive mothers from breastfeeding and participating in skin-to-skin care, advising them to isolate during their window of infectivity. These shifts in perinatal care can adversely impact microbial colonization during the first 1000 days of life. While obstetrical and neonatal management have evolved to reflect our current knowledge of perinatal transmission, we are observing other changes in early life exposures of infants, including increased attention to hygiene, fewer social interactions, and decreased global travel, all of which are major drivers of early-life gut colonization. Composition of the gut microbiota in adults directly impacts severity of infection, suggesting a role of microbial communities in modulating immune responses to COVID-19. Conversely, the role of the intestinal microbiome in susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 in newborns and children remains unknown. The onset of adulthood diseases is related to the establishment of a healthy gut microbiome during childhood. As we continue to define COVID-19 biology, further research is necessary to understand how acquisition of the neonatal microbiome is affected by the pandemic. Furthermore, infection control measures must be balanced with strategies that promote microbial diversity to impart optimal health outcomes and potentially modulate susceptibility of children to COVID-19.","Romano-Keeler, Joann; Zhang, Jilei; Sun, Jun",Gut microbes,https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2021.1912562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33960272/,282

We fit a generalized linear mixed model which includes spatial and temporal terms in order to detect the effect of the meteorological elements and COVID-19 infected cases on the pollutant concentrations. We consider nine counties of the state of New York which registered the highest number of COVID-19 infected cases. We implemented a Bayesian method using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) with a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). The results emphasize that all the components used in designing the model contribute to improving the predicted values and can be included in designing similar real-world data (RWD) models. We found only a weak association between PM(2.5) and ozone concentrations with COVID-19 infected cases.

With billions of lives being affected by this damaging global pandemic, medically assisted procreation services were not left unharmed with far-reaching consequences. New challenges are now emerging concerning COVID-19, such as associated reproductive implications and the consequences of assisted and natural procreation in the presence of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and delayed consequences after patient recovery. There is a hypothesis that testicular damage and subsequent infertility may result following COVID-19 infection and the possibility of sexual transmission, as SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in the semen of infected patients. Vaccine hesitancy in young women planning pregnancies has been heightened because of the spread of misinformation on social media stating that COVID-19 vaccines will cause sterility in women. Reassuring data from accidental pregnancies that have occurred in the clinical trials of approved COVID-19 vaccines indicate that vaccination does not harm fertility or increase the rate of miscarriage. Scientists have quickly related to good tissue practices in vitro fertilization and a rethink is on about encouraging biopsies and focusing on safe vitrification protocols keeping in mind that ova, sperm, and embryos could be possible vectors for disease transmission with the limited research on the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Going ahead with segmented IVF without delay, freezing the generated embryos and pushing back the embryo transfer after the pandemic appears to be the best strategy at present. An international group of researchers have proposed a prognostic stratification of more vulnerable infertility cases in order to plan a progressive restart of worldwide fertility treatments.","Allahbadia, Gautam",J Obstet Gynaecol India,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13224-021-01536-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483511/,282

STUDY DESIGN: The study was performed in two stages: beginning of isolation (April 2020) and 6 months later during the social distancing period (September 2020). METHODS: A total of 305 people who resided in medium-sized cities (population: 50,000 to one million) in the province of Córdoba, Argentina, participated in the study. In the first stage, the participants answered an online questionnaire about creative activities in which they engaged during isolation. In the second stage, semistructured interviews were conducted that asked about changes in life, creative processes, and new endeavors during the social distancing period. RESULTS: In April 2020, positive emotions were associated with the development of creative activities. In September 2020, a predominance of negative emotions that were related to economic, family, and personal difficulties was observed. However, some positive emotions that are related to the development of new ventures and the consolidation of healthy and sustainable habits were also found.

639065,COVID-19: Short and Long-Term Effects of Hospitalization on Muscular Weakness in the Elderly,2020-11-24,"RATIONALE: Disruption of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis is implicated in inflammatory responses. Here we investigated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ efflux through the Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) as a potential mechanism of inflammatory pathophysiology in a ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) mouse model. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were exposed to mechanical ventilation using high tidal volume (HTV). Mice were pretreated with the IP3R agonist carbachol, IP3R inhibitor 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) or the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM. Lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected to measure Ca2+ concentrations, inflammatory responses and mRNA/protein expression associated with ER stress, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inflammation. Analyses were conducted in concert with cultured murine lung cell lines. RESULTS: Lungs from mice subjected to HTV displayed upregulated IP3R expression in ER and mitochondrial-associated-membranes (MAMs), with enhanced formation of MAMs. Moreover, HTV disrupted Ca2+ homeostasis, with increased flux from the ER to the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Administration of carbachol aggravated HTV-induced lung injury and inflammation while pretreatment with 2-APB or BAPTA-AM largely prevented these effects. HTV activated the IRE1α and PERK arms of the ER stress signaling response and induced mitochondrial dysfunction-NLRP3 inflammasome activation in an IP3R-dependent manner. Similarly, disruption of IP3R/Ca2+ in MLE12 and RAW264.7 cells using carbachol lead to inflammatory responses, and stimulated ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Increase in IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release is involved in the inflammatory pathophysiology of VILI via ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Antagonizing IP3R/Ca2+ and/or maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis in lung tissue represents a prospective treatment approach for VILI.","Ye, Liu; Zeng, Qi; Ling, Maoyao; Ma, Riliang; Chen, Haishao; Lin, Fei; Li, Zhao; Pan, Linghui",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.729094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34603302/,282

However, the different numbers of cases and different actions in different countries have been leading to various interesting yet unexplored effects on human behavior. In the present study, we compare the physical activity and recreational screen time of a representative sample of 1711 4- to 17-year-olds before and during the strictest time of the first COVID-19 lockdown in Germany. We found that sports activity declined whereas recreational screen time increased. However, a substantial increase in habitual physical activities leads to an overall increase in physical activity among children and adolescents in Germany. The effects differ in size but not in their direction between age groups and are stable for boys and girls. We conclude from this natural experiment that physical activity among children and adolescents is highly context-driven and mutual and does not act as a functional opposite to recreational screen time.","Schmidt, Steffen C.

A Commentary on the Necessity for Accurate Definitions across Exercise and Physical Activity Programmes,2021-09-01,"Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) firstly spread in China since December 2019. Then, it spread at a high rate around the world. Therefore, rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 has become a very hot research topic. One of the possible diagnostic tools is to use a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) to classify patient images. Chest X-ray is one of the most widely-used imaging techniques for classifying COVID-19 cases. This paper presents a proposed wireless communication and classification system for X-ray images to detect COVID-19 cases. Different modulation techniques are compared to select the most reliable one with less required bandwidth. The proposed DCNN architecture consists of deep feature extraction and classification layers. Firstly, the proposed DCNN hyper-parameters are adjusted in the training phase. Then, the tuned hyper-parameters are utilized in the testing phase. These hyper-parameters are the optimization algorithm, the learning rate, the mini-batch size and the number of epochs. From simulation results, the proposed scheme outperforms other related pre-trained networks. The performance metrics are accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, sensitivity, precision, [Formula: see text] score, specificity, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and Area Under the Curve (AUC).

BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 outbreak has created intense anxiety in nurses/midwives that may affect the care they provide. Nurses and midwives may manage anxiety using solution‐focused thinking skills. METHODS: This descriptive correlational study included 170 nurses/midwives at 61 family health centres evaluated from 1 August to 14 September 2020. RESULTS: The participants' state and trait anxiety scores were above average, indicating a moderate level of anxiety and the mean total solution‐focused inventory scores were at a moderate level. It was determined that 47.9% of the variance in state anxiety scores could be explained by trait anxiety, age, years of professional experience, chronic illness, type of work shift during the pandemic, follow‐up of patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 using computed tomography or a COVID‐19 test, and whether the institution was taking necessary measures against COVID‐19. There was a negative relationship between state anxiety and solution‐focused inventory total score. CONCLUSION: Nurses/midwives displayed a moderate level of anxiety and solution‐focused thinking skills during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

METHODS: Analytic performance of RT-PCR, HDPCR, and extraction-free HDPCR was established through replicate testing of a serially diluted clinical specimen containing SARS-CoV-2. A clinical comparison of all 3 assays was conducted using 351 prospectively collected upper respiratory swab specimens obtained from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals collected in various transport media. RESULTS: RT-PCR and HDPCR assays using extracted nucleic acid demonstrated similar analytic limits of detection (LoD) and clinical performance, with 100% positive and negative agreement. Extraction-free HDPCR demonstrated a 1.5 to 2.0 log(10) increase in LoD based on cycle threshold values. However, clinical performance of extraction-free HDPCR remained high, demonstrating 97.8% positive and 99.6% negative agreement with RT-PCR. An overall increase in “invalid” and “presumptive” results was observed when using the extraction-free method, but this was highly variable based on transport medium used. CONCLUSIONS: HDPCR performs similar to RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The use of an extraction-free HDPCR protocol maintained high clinical performance despite reduced analytic LoD, with the benefit of reduced hands-on time and cost of reagents associated with nucleic acid extraction.","Buchan, Blake W; Gerstbrein, Derek; Cruz, Amorina; Hoff, Jess; Sievert, Emily; Ledeboer, Nathan A; Faron, Matthew L",Am J Clin Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33940605/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcp/aqab060,282

ARL9 is negatively regulated by ARL9 methylation, leading to its low expression in LGG tissues. Both low ARL9 expression and hypermethylation predicted favorable OS and PFS in LGG patients, according to the TCGA database. Cox regression demonstrated that low ARL9 expression and ARL9 hypermethylation were independent biomarkers for OS. Moreover, three other glioma databases were utilized to verify the prognostic role of ARL9 in LGG, and the similar results were reached. A meta-analysis revealed that low ARL9 expression was closely relevant to better OS. Finally, ARL9 expression exhibited a close correlation with some immune cells, especially CD8+ T cells. ARL9 could constitute a promising prognostic biomarker, and probably plays an important role in immune cell infiltration in LGG.","Tan, Yutang; Zhang, Suojun; Xiao, Qungen; Wang, Junwen; Zhao, Kai; Liu, Weihua; Huang, Kuan; Tian, Weidong; Niu, Hongquan; Lei, Ting; Shu, Kai",Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32882327/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888754320311411?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.08.035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0888754320311411,282

The survey took place in the summer and fall of 2020 and asked respondents about food access worries, food assistance use, food insecurity, and food purchasing behaviors. Chi-square analysis examined the relationships between food concerns, food assistance use, purchasing behaviors, and demographic characteristics by reported food insecurity, and significant results were analyzed in a series of logistic regression models. Results showed that higher food worries, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) use, reported food assistance and delivery as food sources, and self-reported Hispanic ethnicity were associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing food insecurity. Future research is needed to assess the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on food access and food insecurity, particularly among underserved groups. Measures that provide additional money for food and improved food access can alleviate barriers to accessing enough healthy food at this time.","Clay, Lauren A.; Rogus, Stephanie",Front Nutr,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2021.647365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34513897/,282

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the decline in ambulatory presentations for vascular events (stroke, transient ischemic attack [TIA], and myocardial infarction [MI]) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke, TIA, or MI documented anonymously in 1,262 general practices in Germany were included. We studied the differences between 2019 and 2020 (between April and June) in terms of rates and baseline characteristics by comparing monthly absolute frequencies. RESULTS: A total of 3,496 patients with stroke (mean age: 72.2 years), 1,608 patients with TIA (mean age: 71.5 years), and 2,385 patients with MI (mean age: 66.8 years) were identified between April and June 2020, indicating a decrease of 10% (stroke), 16% (TIA), and 9% (MI) compared to 2019. For patients with stroke, the decrease in men was 13% (women: −6%) but reached 17% in the age category 51–60 years. For MI, the decrease was only obvious in males (14%). The largest decrease in stroke (−17%) and MI (−19%) was noted in April, while that for TIA occurred in May (−22%). In June for all 3 conditions, the previous year's level was achieved. Only in TIA, the age differs between 2019 and 2020 (mean age: 69.9 vs. 71.5 years; p < 0.05). In patients with stroke and MI, the proportions of men were lower in 2019 than in 2020 (stroke: 54.8–50.5%, p < 0.05 and MI: 64–60.2%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although the decline in the number of patients presenting with stroke, TIA, and MI was not as noticeable in the ambulatory sector as it was in the area of emergency hospital-based care, our data indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic affected all sectors within the medical care system.","Tanislav, Christian; Jacob, Louis; Kostev, Karel",Neuroepidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33530092/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000513812,282

Public Health 2020, 17, 5047",2020-12-28,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emergence in 2003 introduced the first serious human coronavirus pathogen to an unprepared world. To control emerging viruses, existing successful anti(retro)viral therapies can inspire antiviral strategies, as conserved viral enzymes (eg., viral proteases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) represent targets of choice. Since 2003, much effort has been expended in the characterization of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription machinery. Until recently, a pure and highly active preparation of SARS-CoV recombinant RNA synthesis machinery was not available, impeding target-based high throughput screening of drug candidates against this viral family. The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic revealed a new pathogen whose RNA synthesis machinery is highly (>96% aa identity) homologous to SARS-CoV. This phylogenetic relatedness highlights the potential use of conserved replication enzymes to discover inhibitors against this significant pathogen, which in turn, contributes to scientific preparedness against emerging viruses. Here, we report the use of a purified and highly active SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC) to set-up a high-throughput screening of Coronavirus RNA synthesis inhibitors. The screening of a small (1,520 compounds) chemical library of FDA-approved drugs demonstrates the robustness of our assay and will allow to speed-up drug repositioning or novel drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2.

We conducted 52 semi-structured interviews with family caregivers of adults over age 65 or adults with disabilities and analyzed the data through an inductive thematic analysis. Caregivers perceived the largest COVID-19-related caregiving changes to be limited social and physical contacts, changed caregiving tasks, reduced services and supports, and a new focus on vigilance and safety. Caregivers made numerous changes to caregiving, including keeping connected, keeping relatives occupied, getting support and services in new ways, and reducing caregiver stress.","Lightfoot, Elizabeth; Yun, Heejung; Moone, Rajean; Otis, Jacob; Suleiman, Kamal; Turck, Kenneth; Kutzler, Courtney",Gerontol Geriatr Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33816706/; https://doi.org/10.1177/23337214211002404,282

The present scoring system may help assess disease severity and oxygen supply requirements in COVID-19 patients. Methods Data on patient characteristics at baseline and throughout hospitalization for COVID-19 were extracted from medical records. Disease severity was dichotomized into two categories without or with oxygen supply as asymptomatic, mild, and moderate illness (AMMI), and severe and critical illness (CSI). The AMMI and CSI groups were compared. Predictors of disease severity, previously identified in the outpatient setting, were included in multivariable logistic regression analysis; the obtained coefficients were converted to integers and assigned a score. Results A total of 206 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. Correlation between COVID-19 severity and medical information was examined by comparing AMMI and CSI. Age, hemodialysis, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were candidate predictors of the need for oxygen supply in patients with COVID-19. Coefficients associated with age, hemodialysis, and CRP were as follows: 1×age (in years, coded as 0 for values of <50, and as 1 for values of ≥50) + 1× hemodialysis (coded as 0 for “no”, and as 1 for “yes”) + 1×CRP (in mg/dL, coded as 0 for values of <1.0, and as 1 for values of ≥1.0). Patients with scores of ≥2 points required oxygen supply (sensitivity, 68.4%; specificity, 79.0%) Conclusion The present model can help predict disease severity and oxygen requirements in COVID-19 patients in Japan.","Kitajima, Heita; Hirashima, Tomonori; Suzuki, Hidekazu; Arai, Tsuyoshi; Tamura, Yoshitaka; Hashimoto, Shoji; Morishita, Hiroshi; Matsuoka, Hiroto; Kashiwa, Yozo; Han, Yuki; Minamoto, Seijiro; Tanaka, Toshio; Nagai, Takayuki",J Infect Chemother,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2021.05.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X21001306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34023221/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X21001306?v=s5,282

Saudi Arabia’s economy relies heavily on its vast reserves of petroleum, natural gas, iron ore, gold, and copper, but its economic growth trajectory has been uneven since the 1990s. This study examines the effects of carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, and unemployment on economic growth in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Annual time series dataset covering the period 1990–2019 has been extracted from the World Bank and General Authority of Meteorology and Environmental Protection, Saudi Arabia. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration has served to investigate the long-run relationships among the variables. Several time-series diagnostic tests have been conducted on the long-term ARDL model to check its robustness. RESULTS: Saudi Arabia can still achieve higher economic growth without effectively addressing its unemployment problem as both the variables are found to be highly significantly but positively cointegrated in the long-run ARDL model. While the variable of carbon emissions demonstrated a negative effect on the nation’s economic growth, the variables of rainfall and temperate were to some extent cointegrated into the nation’s economic growth in negative and positive ways, respectively. Like most other nations the short-run effects of inflation and population on economic growth do vary, but their long-term effects on the same are found to be positive. CONCLUSIONS: Saudi Arabia can achieve both higher economic growth and lower carbon emissions simultaneously even without effectively addressing the unemployment problem. The nation should utilize modern scientific technologies to annual rainfall losses and to reduce annual temperature in some parts of the country in order to achieve higher economic growth.","Islam, Md Mazharul; Alharthi, Majed; Murad, Md Wahid",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33819275/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248743,282

647531,Catalyzing Knowledge-Driven Discovery in Environmental Health Sciences through a Community-Driven Harmonized Language,2021-08-26,"OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to examine the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules and renal metabolic factors in diabetic mouse kidneys with periodontal pathogen Pg-LPS-induced nephropathy. BACKGROUND: We recently reported that the glomerular endothelium expresses toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 in diabetic environments and TLR2/4 ligand Porphyromonas (P.) gingivalis lipopolysaccharides (Pg-LPS) induce nephropathy in diabetic mice. It is thought that Pg-LPS promotes the chronic inflammation with the overexpression of leukocyte adhesion molecules and renal-specific metabolic enzymes by the recognition of Pg-LPS via TLR in the diabetic kidneys. There have been no reports of the effects of periodontopathic bacteria on the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules and the accumulation of physiologically active substances in the kidney. METHODS: The immunohistochemical investigation was performed on diabetic mouse kidney with Pg-LPS-induced nephropathy with glomerulosclerosis in glomeruli. RESULTS: There were no vessels which expressed vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, or fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic ICR mice (STZ-ICR), or in healthy ICR mice administered Pg-LPS (LPS-ICR). However, in diabetic ICR mouse kidneys with Pg-LPS-induced nephropathy (LPS-STZ) the expression of VCAM-1 and the accumulation of FGF23 were observed in renal tubules and glomeruli, and the expression of E-selectin was observed in renal parenchyma and glomeruli. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was detected in the proximal tubules but not in other regions of ICR, STZ-ICR, or LPS-ICR. In LPS-STZ ACE2 was detected both in renal tubules as well as in glomeruli. The Mac-1 and podoplanin-positive cells increased in the renal parenchyma with diabetic condition and there was the distribution of a large number of Mac-1-positive cells in LPS-STZ. CONCLUSIONS: The Pg-LPS may induce diabetic renal inflammation such as glomerulosclerosis and tubulitis with infiltration of Mac-1/podoplanin positive macrophages via glomerular overexpression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin, resulting in accumulation of both ACE2 and FGF23 which were unmetabolized with the inflammation-induced kidney damage under the diabetic condition.

Methods We linked data from 11,718 NHs to 1) Nursing Home Compare data, 2) the Long-term Care: Facts on care in the U.S., and 3) US county level data on COVID cases and deaths. Our primary independent variable was proportion of minority residents (Blacks and Hispanics) in NHs and its association with mortality rate over time. Results During the first six weeks from June 1,2020, NHs with a higher proportion of Black residents reported more COVID-19 deaths per 1,000 followed by NHs with a higher proportion of Hispanic residents. Between 7 to 12 weeks, NHs with a higher proportion of Hispanic residents reported more deaths per 1,000, followed by NH with a higher proportion of Black residents.

Since COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of autoreactivity, the present study investigates, whether the generation of autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 contributes to this finding. Design: Observational prospective controlled multicenter study. Setting: Blood samples and clinical data of patients with COVID-19 were collected regularly during hospitalization in the period from April to November 2020. Patients: 90 patients with confirmed COVID-19 of mild to critical severity and 30 healthy controls participated in this study. Measuerements and Main Results: Antibodies to ADAMTS13 occurred in 31 (34.4%) patients with COVID-19. Generation of ADAMTS13 antibodies was associated with a significantly lower ADAMTS13 activity (56.5%, interquartile range (IQR) 21.25 vs. 71.5%, IQR 24.25, p=0.0041), increased disease severity (severe or critical disease in 90% vs. 62.3%, p=0.0189), and a trend to a higher mortality (35.5% vs. 18.6%, p=0.0773). Median time to antibody development was 11 days after first positive SARS-CoV-2-PCR specimen. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates for the first time, that generation of antibodies to ADAMTS13 is a frequent finding in COVID-19. Generation of these antibodies is associated with a lower ADAMTS13 activity and an increased risk of an adverse course of the disease suggesting an inhibitory effect on the protease.

It is a response to various diseases of variable etiology, including SARS-CoV infection. To date, a comprehensive study of the genomic physiopathology of ARDS (and SARS) is lacking, primarily due to the difficulty of finding suitable materials to study the disease process at a tissue level (instead of blood, sputa or swaps). Hereby we attempt to provide such study by analyzing autopsy lung samples from patient who died of SARS and showed different degrees of severity of the pulmonary involvement. We performed real-time quantitative PCR analysis of 107 genes with functional roles in inflammation, coagulation, fibrosis and apoptosis; some key genes were confirmed at a protein expression level by immunohistochemistry and correlated to the degree of morphological severity present in the individual samples analyzed. Significant expression levels were identified for ANPEP (a receptor for CoV), as well as inhibition of the STAT1 pathway, IFNs production and CXCL10 (a T-cell recruiter).

As a result, we proposed to therapeutically target some of these genes with compounds such as ANPEP inhibitors, SLPI and dexamethasone. Ultimately, this study may serve as a model for future, tissue-based analyses of fibroinflammatory conditions affecting the lung.","Kong, Say Li; Chui, Paul; Lim, Bing; Salto-Tellez, Manuel",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170209002494; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2009.07.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19635508/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170209002494,282

The Clinical Blood Sciences Laboratory (CBSL) plays a key role in supporting the monitoring and management of patients with COVID-19 disease. OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive CBSL testing protocol to support the medical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Description of the biochemical, haematological and immunological tests that have a role in the assessment and monitoring of patients with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: We provide a test menu for clinical laboratories to ensure the effective monitoring, management and prognostication of COVID-19 patients in hospital. CONCLUSION: Given the rapidity with which patients with COVID-19 disease can deteriorate, we recommend regular testing with vigilance paid to the rate and trajectory of change in each of these parameters.","O’Shea, Paula M.; Lee, Graham Robert; Griffin, Tomás P.; Tormey, Vincent; Hayat, Amjad; Costelloe, Seán J.; Griffin, Damian Gerard; Srinivasan, Saradha; O’Kane, Maurice; Burke, Conor M.; Faul, John; Thompson, Christopher J.; Curley, Gerard; Tormey, William P.",Ir J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-020-02252-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32424603/,282

Having access to testing is paramount in preventing future infections and receiving adequate treatment. Currently, there are numerous conventional methods for DENV testing, such as NS1 based antigen testing, IgM/IgG antibody testing, and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). In addition, novel methods are emerging that can cut both cost and time. Such methods can be effective in rural and low-income areas throughout the world. In this paper, we discuss the structural evolution of the virus followed by a comprehensive review of current dengue detection strategies and methods that are being developed or commercialized. We also discuss the state of art biosensing technologies, evaluated their performance and outline strategies to address challenges posed by the disease. Further, we outline future guidelines for the improved usage of diagnostic tools during recurrence or future outbreaks of DENV.","Kabir, Md Alamgir; Zilouchian, Hussein; Younas, Muhammad Awais; Asghar, Waseem",Biosensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/bios11070206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201849/,282

A microbial agent is only identified in 15–30% of the fever episodes and corresponds mostly to bacterial findings. OBJECTIVE: To investigate viral infections as possible etiologic agents in episodes of febrile neutropenia. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from patients presenting with neutropenic fever at two pediatric oncology wards in Sweden and Australia were analyzed with a conventional virus-diagnostic approach and RT-PCR. Coupled blood samples were analyzed for the detection of CMV, EBV, adenovirus and erythrovirus. Bacterial blood culture was performed routinely. RESULTS: Conventional virus-diagnostic approach coupled to routinely performed bacterial analyzes revealed an infectious agent in 29% compared to 60% when using PCR. By adding PCR, a viral pathogen was detected in 46% of the NPAs and in 4% of the blood samples collected. In half of the patients with bacteremia, respiratory tract viruses were co-detected. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses were frequently detected in NPAs suggesting a significant role of viral infections in children presenting with neutropenic fever. The meaning of these findings needs to be further evaluated but has the potential to individualize infection treatment and to reduce the extensive use of antibiotics in immunocompromised children with neutropenia.","Lindblom, Anna; Bhadri, Vivek; Söderhäll, Stefan; Öhrmalm, Lars; Wong, Michelle; Norbeck, Oscar; Lindau, Cecilia; Rotzén-Östlund, Maria; Allander, Tobias; Catchpoole, Daniel; Dalla-Pozza, Luciano; Broliden, Kristina; Tolfvenstam, Thomas",J Clin Virol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653209005678; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20056482/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653209005678; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.11.026,282

This paper is based on a systematic review of TTS and stress cardiomyopathy using a PubMed literature search. Typically, an episode of severe emotional or physical stress precipitates regions of left ventricular hypokinesis or akinesis, which are not aligned with a coronary artery distribution and are out of proportion to the modest troponin leak. A classic patient with TTS is described; one who had chest pain and dyspnea while watching an anxiety-provoking evening news program on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. An increase in the incidence of TTS appears to be a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the TTS incidence rising 4.5-fold during the COVID-19 pandemic even in individuals without severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Takotsubo syndrome is often mistaken for acute coronary syndrome because they both typically present with chest pain, electrocardiographic changes suggesting myocardial injury/ischemia, and troponin elevations. Recent studies report that the prognosis for TTS is similar to that for acute myocardial infarction. This review is an update on the mechanisms underlying TTS, its diagnosis, and its optimal management.","O’Keefe, Evan L.; Torres-Acosta, Noel; O’Keefe, James H.; Sturgess, Jessica E.; Lavie, Carl J.; Bybee, Kevin A.",Mayo Clin Proc Innov Qual Outcomes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2020.08.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542454820301612; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33283161/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2542454820301612,282

No unified diagnostic standard has been formulated. The initial diagnosis remains based on the positive of nucleic acid tests. However, early nucleic acid tests were identified to be negative in some patients, whereas the patients exhibited characteristic CT changes of lung, and positive test results appeared after repeated nucleic acid tests, having caused the failure to diagnose these patients early. The study aimed to delve into the relationships between initial nucleic acid testing and early lung CT changes in patients with COVID-19. METHOD: In accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnostic criteria, 69 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 treated in the infected V ward of Xiaogan Central Hospital from 2020/1/25 to 2020/2/6 were retrospectively analyzed. The consistency between the first COVID-19 nucleic acid test positive and lung CT changes was studied. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of CT and initial nucleic acid were studied. RESULT: The Kappa coefficient of initial nucleic acid positive changes and lung CT changes was −1.52. With a positive nucleic acid test as the gold standard, the sensitivity of lung CT was 12.00 %, 95 % CI: 4.6–24.3; with the changes of CT as the gold standard, the sensitivity of nucleic acid positive was 30.16 %, 95 % CI: 19.2−43.0.

The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on host targets remains largely limited, hampering our understanding of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis and the development of therapeutic strategies. The present study used a comprehensive untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic approach to capture the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that several circulating lipids acted as potential biomarkers, such as phosphatidylcholine 14:0_22:6 (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.96), phosphatidylcholine 16:1_22:6 (AUC = 0.97), and phosphatidylethanolamine 18:1_20:4 (AUC = 0.94). Furthermore, triglycerides and free fatty acids, especially arachidonic acid (AUC = 0.99) and oleic acid (AUC = 0.98), were well correlated to the severity of the disease. An untargeted analysis of non-critical COVID-19 patients identified a strong alteration of lipids and a perturbation of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA degradation, arachidonic acid metabolism, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The severity of the disease was characterized by the activation of gluconeogenesis and the metabolism of porphyrins, which play a crucial role in the progress of the infection. In addition, our study provided further evidence for considering phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity as a potential key factor in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and a possible therapeutic target. To date, the present study provides the largest untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics analysis of plasma from COVID-19 patients and control groups, identifying new mechanisms associated with the host response to COVID-19, potential plasma biomarkers, and therapeutic targets.","Barberis, Elettra; Timo, Sara; Amede, Elia; Vanella, Virginia V.; Puricelli, Chiara; Cappellano, Giuseppe; Raineri, Davide; Cittone, Micol G.; Rizzi, Eleonora; Pedrinelli, Anita R.; Vassia, Veronica; Casciaro, Francesco G.; Priora, Simona; Nerici, Ilaria; Galbiati, Alessandra; Hayden, Eyal; Falasca, Marco; Vaschetto, Rosanna; Sainaghi, Pier Paolo; Dianzani, Umberto; Rolla, Roberta; Chiocchetti, Annalisa; Baldanzi, Gianluca; Marengo, Emilio; Manfredi, Marcello",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33207699/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21228623,282

Although there is no promising treatment, identification of early predictors of in-hospital mortality would be critically important in reducing its worldwide mortality. We aimed to suggest a prediction model for in-hospital mortality of COVID-19. In this case–control study, we recruited 513 conﬁrmed patients with COVID-19 from February 18 to March 26, 2020 from Isfahan COVID-19 registry. Based on extracted laboratory, clinical, and demographic data, we created an in-hospital mortality predictive model using gradient boosting. We also determined the diagnostic performance of the proposed model including sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) as well as their 95% CIs. Of 513 patients, there were 60 (11.7%) in-hospital deaths during the study period. The diagnostic values of the suggested model based on the gradient boosting method with oversampling techniques using all of the original data were specificity of 98.5% (95% CI: 96.8–99.4), sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 94–100), negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI: 99.2–100), positive predictive value of 89.6% (95% CI: 79.7–95.7), and an AUC of 98.6%. The suggested model may be useful in making decision to patient’s hospitalization where the probability of mortality may be more obvious based on the final variable. However, moderate gaps in our knowledge of the predictors of in-hospital mortality suggest further studies aiming at predicting models for in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Abdollahpour, Ibrahim; Aguilar-Palacio, Isabel; Gonzalez-Garcia, Juan; Vaseghi, Golnaz; Otroj, Zahra; Manteghinejad, Amirreza; Mosayebi, Azam; Salimi, Yahya; Haghjooy Javanmard, Shaghayegh",Am J Trop Med Hyg,https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-1039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33591938/,282

Findings from a College Sample,2021-06-02,"BACKGROUND: Neurological symptoms are increasingly being noted among COVID-19 patients. Currently, there is little data on the mental health of neurological healthcare workers. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence and influencing factors on anxiety and depression in neurological healthcare workers in Hunan Province, China during the early stage of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study was conducted among neurological doctors and nurses in early February 2020 in Hunan Province. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed by the Chinese version of the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) (defined as a total score ≥ 50) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) (defined as a total score ≥ 53). The prevalences of probable anxiety and depression were compared between different groups, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to understand the independent influencing factors on anxiety and depression. RESULTS: The prevalence of probable anxiety and depression in neurological nurses (20.3 and 30.2%, respectively) was higher than that in doctors (12.6 and 20.2%, respectively). Female healthcare workers (18.4%) had a higher proportion of anxiety than males (10.8%). Probable anxiety and depression were more prevalent among nurses, younger workers (≤ 40 years), and medical staff with junior titles. Logistic regression analysis showed that a shortage of protective equipment was independently associated with probable anxiety (OR = 1.980, 95% CI: 1.241–3.160, P = 0.004), while young age was a risk factor for probable depression (OR = 2.293, 95% CI: 1.137–4.623, P = 0.020) among neurological healthcare workers. CONCLUSIONS: Probable anxiety and depression were more prevalent among neurological nurses than doctors in Hunan Province. The shortage of protective equipment led to probable anxiety, and young age led to probable depression in healthcare workers in neurology departments, which merits attention during the battle against COVID-19.","Ning, Xianjun; Yu, Fang; Huang, Qin; Li, Xi; Luo, Yunfang; Huang, Qing; Chen, Changqing",BMC Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32891124/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02838-z,282

We assessed these risks in patients with MS (PwMS). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe the overall risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, severe disease course, and potential population-level predictors of COVID-19 infection in PwMS, and to provide a context using a cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In addition, the association of different MS DMTs with the incidence and clinical course of COVID-19 was evaluated. Safety data from the Biogen Global Safety Database are also presented on reported cases of COVID-19 in patients treated with Biogen MS therapies. METHODS: The IBM(®) Explorys electronic health record database of > 72,000,000 patients from US healthcare networks identified patients with MS or SLE, with and without polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19. COVID-19 cumulative incidence, hospitalization, and deaths among DMT classes were compared using logistic regression (adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, comorbidities, and race/ethnicity). As a secondary data source to assess safety data, COVID-19 reports for Biogen MS therapies were extracted and described from Biogen’s Global Safety Database. RESULTS: 30,478 PwMS with an open DMT prescription were identified within Explorys; 344 were COVID-19 positive. The most significant risk factors for acquiring COVID-19 were comorbidity score ≥ 1, body mass index ≥ 30, and Black/African ancestry. Similar risk factors were also identified for patients with SLE. Patients with MS were less likely to develop COVID-19 when treated with interferons (0.61%) and glatiramer acetate (0.51%), vs all other MS DMTs (both p < 0.001); anti-CD20 therapy was associated with the highest risk (3.45%; p < 0.0001). In the Biogen Global Safety Database, we identified 1217 patients who were COVID-19 positive treated with intramuscular interferon beta-1a, peginterferon beta-1a, natalizumab, dimethyl fumarate, diroximel fumarate, or fampridine. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities, obesity, and Black/African ancestry, but not age, were associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in PwMS. Interferons and glatiramer acetate were associated with a reduced COVID-19 risk, whereas anti-CD20 therapies were associated with an increased risk, within the treated MS cohort. COVID-19 safety reports for patients receiving Biogen MS therapies were consistent with the Explorys database and MS literature, illustrating the replicability and power of this approach.

Currently, various initiatives collect sales data of veterinary antimicrobials, thereby providing an overview of quantities on the market. However, sales data collected at the level of wholesalers or marketing authorization holders are of limited use to associate with the prevalence of bacterial resistances at species level. We converted sales data to the number of potential treatments of calves and pigs in Switzerland for the years 2011 to 2015 using animal course doses (ACD). For each authorized product, the number of potential therapies was derived from the sales at wholesaler's level and the ACD in mg per kg. For products registered for use in multiple species, a percentage of the sales was attributed to each authorized species according to their biomass distribution. We estimated a total of 5,914,349 therapies for pigs and 1,407,450 for calves in 2015. Using the number of slaughtered animals for that year as denominator, we calculated a treatment intensity of 2.15 therapies per pig and 5.96 per calf. Between 2011 and 2015, sales of veterinary antimicrobials decreased by 30%. The calculated number of potential therapies decreased by 30% for pigs and 15% for calves. An analysis of treatment intensity at antimicrobial class level showed a decrease of 64% for colistin used in pigs, and of 7% for macrolides used in both pigs and calves. Whereas the use of 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins in calves decreased by 15.8%, usage of fluoroquinolones increased by 10.8% in the same period. Corresponding values for pigs were −16.4 and +0.7%. This is the first extrapolation of antimicrobial usage at product level for pigs and calves in Switzerland. It shows that calves were more frequently treated than pigs with a decreasing trend for both number of therapies and use of colistin, macrolides and cephalosporins 3rd and 4th generations. Nonetheless, we calculated an increase in the usage of fluoroquinolones. Altogether, this study's outcomes allow for trend analysis and can be used to assess the relationship between antimicrobial use and resistance at the national level.","Stebler, Rosa; Carmo, Luís P.; Heim, Dagmar; Naegeli, Hanspeter; Eichler, Klaus; Muentener, Cedric R.",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616676/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2019.00318,282

The underlying innate immune mechanisms, which represent the first line of defense against pathogens, remain incompletely understood. Drosophila melanogaster is able to mount potent and evolutionarily conserved innate immune defenses against a variety of microorganisms including viruses and serves as an excellent model organism for studying host–pathogen interactions. With its relatively short lifespan, Drosophila also is an organism of choice for aging studies. Despite numerous advantages that this model offers, Drosophila has not been used to its full potential to investigate the response of the aged host to viral infection. Here, we show that, in comparison to younger flies, aged Drosophila succumb more rapidly to infection with the RNA-containing Flock House virus due to an age-dependent defect in disease tolerance. Relative to younger individuals, we find that older Drosophila mount transcriptional responses characterized by differential regulation of more genes and genes regulated to a greater extent. We show that loss of disease tolerance to Flock House virus with age associates with a stronger regulation of genes involved in apoptosis, some genes of the Drosophila immune deficiency NF-kB pathway, and genes whose products function in mitochondria and mitochondrial respiration. Our work shows that Drosophila can serve as a model to investigate host–virus interactions during aging and furthermore sets the stage for future analysis of the age-dependent mechanisms that govern survival and control of virus infections at older age.","Sheffield, Lakbira; Sciambra, Noah; Evans, Alysa; Hagedorn, Eli; Goltz, Casey; Delfeld, Megan; Kuhns, Haley; Fierst, Janna L; Chtarbanova, Stanislava",G3 (Bethesda),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33836060/; https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkab116,282
655459,Lessons Learned during a Naturalistic Study of Online Treatment for Pediatric Rehabilitation,2021-06-21,"Introduction Exposure to disaster-related media may be a risk factor for mental distress, but this has not been examined in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 pandemic. This study assesses if exposure to social and traditional media during the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with mental distress among U.S. adults. Methods Data came from the Understanding America Study, a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of adults who completed surveys online. Participants included 6,329 adults surveyed between March 10 and March 31, 2020. Regression analyses examined associations of: (1) self-reported average time spent on social media in a day (hours) and (2) number of traditional media sources (radio, TV, and newspaper) consulted to learn about COVID-19 with self-reported mental distress (4-item Patient Health Questionnaire). Data were analyzed in April 2020. Results Participants responding at later survey dates reported more time spent on social media (β=0.02, 95% CI=0.01, 0.03), a greater number of traditional media sources consulted to learn about COVID-19 (β=0.01, 95% CI=0.01, 0.02), and greater mental distress (β=0.07, 95% CI=0.04, 0.09). Increased time spent on social media and consulting a greater number of traditional media sources to learn about COVID-19 were independently associated with increased mental distress, even after adjusting for potential confounders (social media: β=0.14, 95% CI=0.05, 0.23; traditional media: β=0.14, 95% CI=0.08, 0.20). Conclusions Exposure to a greater number of traditional media sources and more hours of social media was modestly associated with mental distress during the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.","Riehm, Kira E.; Holingue, Calliope; Kalb, Luther G.; Bennett, Daniel; Kapteyn, Arie; Jiang, Qin; Veldhuis, Cindy; Johnson, Renee M.; Fallin, M.

We investigated the impact of the pandemic on coping strategies and anxiety and depression in lung transplantation (LT) recipients and patients with end-stage chronic lung disease awaiting LT. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated coping strategies by using the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations questionnaire and anxiety and depression symptoms by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale in 115 LT candidates and recipients. RESULTS: Overall, 63 participants (20 women; median age 59 years [interquartile range 52-65]) answered one or both questionnaires (49 LT recipients and 14 LT candidates). The preferred coping strategy was task-focused for 51 (86.4%) participants, with no difference between LT recipients and candidates nor according to the main anamnestic and clinical data. Eleven patients had suspected or proven depression symptoms, and 18 had suspected or proven anxiety symptoms. Coping strategies related to COVID-19 did not differ by presence of anxiety or depression symptoms. CONCLUSION: In the current pandemic, healthcare professionals should consider these results to provide relevant psychological help to these fragile populations and promote a systematic and wide multidisciplinary assessment of LT recipients and candidates.","Savary, Alice; Hammouda, Malika; Genet, Lucie; Godet, Cendrine; Bunel, Vincent; Weisenburger, Gaelle; Goletto, Tiphaine; Medraoui, Chahine; Jebrak, Gilles; Marceau, Armelle; Tran-Dinh, Alexy; Mordant, Pierre; Castier, Yves; Montravers, Philippe; Mal, Herve; Messika, Jonathan",Respir Med Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590041221000362?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resmer.2021.100847; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590041221000362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34371237/,282

This study aims to determine whether there are any relationships between social media use, preventive behavior, perceived threat of coronavirus, self-efficacy, and socio-demographic characteristics. The data were collected from 310 respondents across Pakistan using an online cross-sectional survey. Reliability analyses were performed for all scales and structural equational modeling was used to identify the relationships between study variables. We found that: (i) social media use predicts self-efficacy (β = 0.25, p < 0.05) and perceived threat of coronavirus (β = 0.54, p < 0.05, R(2) = 0.06), and (ii) preventive behavior is predicted by self-efficacy and perceived threat of coronavirus (R = 0.10, p < 0.05). Therefore, these results indicate the importance of social media's influence on health-related behaviors.

In teaching comprehensive care practices, CBME can involve citizens from the relevant community. This research synthesizes the impact of the involvement of communities on the learning of medical trainees in CBME. We conducted a systematic review, in which we searched ten databases from April 1990 to August 2020 for original articles in Japan regarding CBME involving citizens and descriptively analyzed them. The Kirkpatrick model was used to categorize the outcomes. Our search for studies following the protocol returned 1240 results; 21 articles were included in this systematic review. Medical trainees reported satisfaction with the content, teaching processes, and teachers’ qualities. Medical trainees’ attitudes toward community and rural medicine improved; they were motivated to become family physicians and work in communities and remote areas. This review clarified that citizen involvement in CBME had an effective impact on medical trainees, positively affecting perceptions of this type of education, as well as improving trainees’ knowledge about and attitude toward community and rural medicine.","Ohta, Ryuichi; Ryu, Yoshinori; Sano, Chiaki",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33562329/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041575,282

658171,Facemasks: A Looming Microplastic Crisis,2021-07-01,"Background/aim: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease with a high rate of progression to critical illness. However, the predictors of mortality in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are not yet well understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the risk factors associated with ICU mortality in our hospital. Materials and methods: In this single-centered retrospective study, we enrolled 86 critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU of Dokuz Eylül University Hospital (Izmir, Turkey) between 18 March 2020 and 31 October 2020. Data on demographic information, preexisting comorbidities, treatments, the laboratory findings at ICU admission, and clinical outcomes were collected. The chest computerized tomography (CT) of the patients were evaluated specifically for COVID-19 and CT score was calculated. Data of the survivors and nonsurvivors were compared with survival analysis to identify risk factors of mortality in the ICU. Results: The mean age of the patients was 71.1 ± 14.1 years. The patients were predominantly male. The most common comorbidity in patients was hypertension. ICU mortality was 62.8%. Being over 60 years old, CT score > 15, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score ≥ 15, having dementia, treatment without favipiravir, base excess in blood gas analysis ≤ ­2.0, WBC > 10,000/mm3, D-dimer > 1.6 µg/mL, troponin > 24 ng/L, Na ≥ 145 mmol/L were considered to link with ICU mortality according to Kaplan­Meier curves (log-rank test, p < 0.05). The APACHE II score (HR: 1.055, 95% CI: 1.021­1.090) and chest CT score (HR: 2.411, 95% CI:1.193­4.875) were associated with ICU mortality in the cox proportional-hazard regression model adjusted for age, dementia, favipiravir treatment and troponin. Howewer, no difference was found between survivors and nonsurvivors in terms of intubation timing. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients have a high ICU admission and mortality rate. Studies in the ICU are also crucial in this respect. In our study, we investigated the ICU mortality risk factors of COVID-19 patients. We determined a predictive mortality model consisting of APACHE II score and chest CT score. It was thought that this feasible and practical model would assist in making clinical decisions.","Bayrak, Vecihe; Sentürk Durukan, Nurcan; Demirer Aydemir, Ferhan; Ergan, Begüm; Gezer, N.

Rodents are important reservoir hosts for many zoonotic pathogens, and rodent population dynamics affect the infection dynamics of rodent-borne diseases, such as diseases caused by hantaviruses. However, the role of rodent population dynamics in determining the infection dynamics of rodent-associated tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme borreliosis (LB), caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria, have gained limited attention in Northern Europe, despite the multiannual abundance fluctuations, the so-called vole cycles, that characterise rodent population dynamics in the region. Here, we quantify the associations between rodent abundance and LB human cases and Puumala Orthohantavirus (PUUV) infections by using two time series (25-year and 9-year) in Finland. Both bank vole (Myodes glareolus) abundance as well as LB and PUUV infection incidence in humans showed approximately 3-year cycles. Without vector transmitted PUUV infections followed the bank vole host abundance fluctuations with two-month time lag, whereas tick-transmitted LB was associated with bank vole abundance ca. 12 and 24 months earlier. However, the strength of association between LB incidence and bank vole abundance ca. 12 months before varied over the study years. This study highlights that the human risk to acquire rodent-borne pathogens, as well as rodent-associated tick-borne pathogens is associated with the vole cycles in Northern Fennoscandia, yet with complex time lags.","Aminikhah, Mahdi; Forsman, Jukka T.; Koskela, Esa; Mappes, Tapio; Sane, Jussi; Ollgren, Jukka; Kivelä, Sami M.; Kallio, Eva R.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95000-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34373474/,282

Inflammation is associated withthe enhanced production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and with a marked reduction in the plasma concentrations of protective antioxidant molecules. This imbalance gives rise to oxidative stress, which is greater in patients with more severe conditions such as sepsis, cancer, cardiovascular disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and burns. In these patients, oxidative stress can trigger cell, tissue, and organ damage, thus increasing morbidity and mortality. Ascorbic acid (ASC) is a key nutrient thatserves as an antioxidant and a cofactor for numerous enzymatic reactions. However, humans, unlike most mammals, are unable to synthesize it. Consequently, ASC must be obtained through dietary sources, especially fresh fruit and vegetables. The value of administering exogenous micronutrients, to reestablish antioxidant concentrations in patients with severe disease, has been recognized for decades. Despite the suggestion that ASC supplementation may reduce oxidative stress and prevent several chronic conditions, few large, randomized clinical trials have tested it in patients with severe illness. This article reviews the recent literature on the pharmacological profile of ASC and the role of its supplementation in critically ill patients.","Berretta, Massimiliano; Quagliariello, Vincenzo; Maurea, Nicola; Di Francia, Raffaele; Sharifi, Saman; Facchini, Gaetano; Rinaldi, Luca; Piezzo, Michela; Manuela, Ceccarelli; Nunnari, Giuseppe; Montopoli, Monica",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33256059/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox9121182,282

The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation between serum regulatory cytokines concentrations and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease. METHODS: We enrolled 325 children aged < 24 months who were diagnosed with acute respiratory tract infection. Twenty age-matched healthy children were enrolled as controls. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed to identify virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and blood samples were taken to quantify the regulatory cytokine concentrations, including interleukin (IL)-35, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 using the Bio-Plex immunoassay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: RSV disease was associated with a great regulatory cytokine response than healthy children, among 89 RSV-infected patients, serum IL-35 (P = .0001) and IL-10 (P = .006) was significantly elevated in comparison with healthy controls. Young children (0< age ≤6 months) with RSV infection had significantly lower IL-35 and IL-10 expression but needed more oxygen therapy and more severe disease comparing with older children (12< age <24 months). Comparing with mild group, the expression levels of IL-10 were significantly lower in children with moderate and severe disease (P = .012 and P = .005, respectively). And levels of IL-10 was inversely associated with total duration of RSV infection symptoms (r = − 0.311, P = .019). CONCLUSION: Children with RSV infected had increased serum regulatory cytokine IL-10 and IL-35 concentrations. Elevated expression of IL-10 and IL-35 were contributed to protect hypoxia and reduce the severity of disease.","Fan, Ruyan; Wen, Bo; Liu, Wenpei; Zhang, Jian; Liu, Chan; Fan, Chuping; Qu, Xiaowang",Cytokine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104346661730399X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2017.12.028; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S104346661730399X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29324262/,282

There are several reasons to hypothesize that the eye, and the retina in particular, could be a target of organ damage in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This cohort observational study analyzes OCT angiography and structural OCT of 70 post-COVID-19 patients evaluated at 1-month hospital discharge and 22 healthy control subjects. Primary outcomes were macular vessel density (VD) and vessel perfusion (VP); structural OCT features were evaluated as secondary outcomes. In addition, patients and healthy volunteers were evaluated for best corrected visual acuity, slit lamp photograph, and fundus photo image. RESULTS: VD and VP in 3 × 3 and 6 × 6 mm scans for SCP and DCP showed no significant differences between the groups. Similarly, CMT and GCL did not reveal significant differences between post-COVID-19 and healthy patients. Nine patients (12.9%) featured retinal cotton wool spots and 10 patients had vitreous fibrillary degeneration. The prevalence of epiretinal membrane and macular hole was similar in the two groups. One case of extra papillary focal retinal hemorrhage was reported in the post-COVID-19 group.

Severe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a major immune inflammatory response with cytokine upregulation including interleukin 6 (IL-6). We report a case presenting with acute encephalitis that was diagnosed as having severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with hyperinflammatory systemic response and recovered after therapy with immunoglobulins and cytokine blockade. Case Report: A 39-year-old-man was brought to the Emergency Department with drowsiness, mental disorientation, intermittent fever and headache. A brain magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive involvement of the brain including cortical and subcortical right frontal regions, right thalamus, bilateral temporal lobes and cerebral peduncles, with no leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a leukocyte count of 20/µL (90% lymphocytes), protein level of 198 mg/dL, and glucose of 48 mg/dL. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs by reverse-transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) but it was negative in the CSF. Remarkable laboratory findings in blood tests included low lymphocyte count and elevated ferritin, IL-6 and D-dimer. He had a complicated clinical course requiring mechanical ventilation. Intravenous immunoglobulins and cytokine blockade with tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, were added considering acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis. The patient made a full recovery, suggesting that it could have been related to host inflammatory response. Conclusion This case report indicates that COVID-19 may present as an encephalitis syndrome mimicking acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis that could be amenable to therapeutic modulation.","Freire-Álvarez, Eric; Guillén, Lucía; Lambert, Karine; Baidez, Ana; García-Quesada, Miguel; Andreo, María; Alom, Jordi; Masiá, Mar; Gutiérrez, Félix",Clin Infect Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33163956/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590170220300406?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590170220300406; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinpr.2020.100053,282

To aid the evaluation of the impact of interventions, we present daily time-series of three different aggregated mobility metrics: the origin-destination movements between Italian provinces, the radius of gyration, and the average degree of a spatial proximity network. All metrics were computed by processing a large-scale dataset of anonymously shared positions of about 170,000 de-identified smartphone users before and during the outbreak, at the sub-national scale.

The aim of this study was to apply the Ophelia (Optimizing Health Literacy and Access) process, a widely used systematic approach to whole of community co-design, to the digital context to generate solutions to improve health and equity outcomes. Methods: This was a mixed method study. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken at 3 health organizations in Victoria, Australia using the eHealth Literacy Questionnaire (eHLQ) as a needs assessment tool. Cluster analysis was conducted to identify subgroups with varying eHealth literacy needs. These data, combined with semi-structured interviews with clients, were used to generate vignettes representing different eHealth literacy profiles. The vignettes were presented at co-design workshops with clients and health professionals to generate solutions for digital health services improvement. Expert validation and proof-of-concept testing was explored through mapping the process against Ophelia guiding principles. Results: The cluster analyses identified 8 to 9 clusters with different profiles of eHealth literacy needs, with 4 to 6 vignettes developed to represent the eHealth literacy strengths and weaknesses of clients at each of the 3 sites. A total of 32, 43, and 32 solutions across 10 strategies were co-created based on ideas grounded in local expertise and experiences. Apart from digital solutions, non-digital solutions were frequently recommended as a strategy to address eHealth literacy needs. Expert validation identified at least half of the ideas were very important and feasible, while most of the guiding principles of the Ophelia process were successfully applied. Conclusion: By harnessing collective creativity through co-design, the Ophelia process has been shown to assist the development of solutions with the potential to improve health and equity outcomes in the digital context. Implementation of the solutions is needed to provide further evidence of the impact of the process. The suggested inclusion of non-digital solutions revealed through the co-design process reminds health organizations and policymakers that solutions should be flexible enough to suit individual needs. As such, taking a co-design approach to digital health initiatives will assist in preventing the widening of health inequalities.","Cheng, Christina; Elsworth, Gerald R.; Osborne, Richard H.",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330344/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.604401,282

664196,The Impact of Pandemic Management on the Quality of Life of Slovak Dentists,2021-05-20,"Social distancing measures have been implemented in the United States (US) since March 2020, to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. However, by mid-May most states began relaxing these measures to support the resumption of economic activity, even as disease incidence continued to increase in many states. To evaluate the impact of relaxing social distancing restrictions on COVID-19 dynamics and control in the US, we developed a transmission dynamic model and calibrated it to US state-level COVID-19 cases and deaths from March to June 20(th), 2020, using Bayesian methods. We used this model to evaluate the impact of reopening, social distancing, testing, contact tracing, and case isolation on the COVID-19 epidemic in each state. We found that using stay-at-home orders, most states were able to curtail their COVID-19 epidemic curve by reducing and achieving an effective reproductive number below 1. But by June 20(th), 2020, only 19 states and the District of Columbia were on track to curtail their epidemic curve with a 75% confidence, at current levels of reopening. Of the remaining 31 states, 24 may have to double their current testing and/or contact tracing rate to curtail their epidemic curve, and seven need to further restrict social contact by 25% in addition to doubling their testing and contact tracing rates. When social distancing restrictions are being eased, greater state-level testing and contact tracing capacity remains paramount for mitigating the risk of large-scale increases in cases and deaths.","Chiu, Weihsueh A.; Fischer, Rebecca; Ndeffo-Mbah, Martial L.",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-40364/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32702727/,282

COVID-19 spreads between humans through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The COVID-19 outbreak originated in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019. As of 29 Sept 2020, over 235 countries, areas or territories across the globe reported a total of 33,441,919 confirmed cases, and 1,003,497 confirmed deaths due to COVID-19. Individuals of all ages are at risk for infection, but in most cases disease severity is associated with age and pre-existing diseases that compromise immunity, like cancer. Numerous reports suggest that people with cancer can be at higher risk of severe illness and related deaths from COVID-19. Therefore, managing cancer care under this pandemic is challenging and requires a collaborative multidisciplinary approach for optimal care of cancer patients in hospital settings. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer patients, their care, and treatment. Further, this review covers the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, genome characterization, COVID-19 pathophysiology, and associated signaling pathways in cancer, and the choice of anticancer agents as repurposed drugs for treating COVID-19.","Pathania, Anup S.; Prathipati, Philip; Abdul, Bakrudeen AA.; Chava, Srinivas; Katta, Santharam S.; Gupta, Subash C.; Gangula, Pandu R.; Pandey, Manoj K.; Durden, Donald L.; Byrareddy, Siddappa N.; Challagundla, Kishore B.",Theranostics,https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.51471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33391502/,282
664569,Experiences of LGBTIQA+ People with Disability in Healthcare and Community Services: Towards Embracing Multiple Identities,2020-11-02,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: An outbreak of respiratory illness of unknown aetiology was reported from Hubei province of Wuhan, People's Republic of China, in December 2019. The outbreak was attributed to a novel coronavirus (CoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and the disease as COVID-19. Within one month, cases were reported from 25 countries. In view of the novel viral strain with reported high morbidity, establishing early countrywide diagnosis to detect imported cases became critical. Here we describe the role of a countrywide network of VRDLs in early diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, established screening as well as confirmatory assays for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 13 VRDLs were provided with the E gene screening real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. VRDLs were selected on the basis of their presence near an international airport/seaport and their past performance. The case definition for testing included all individuals with travel history to Wuhan and symptomatic individuals with travel history to other parts of China. This was later expanded to include symptomatic individuals returning from Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and South Korea. RESULTS: Within a week of standardization of the test at NIV, all VRDLs could initiate testing for SARS-CoV-2. Till February 29, 2020, a total of 2,913 samples were tested. This included both 654 individuals quarantined in the two camps and others fitting within the case definition. The quarantined individuals were tested twice - at days 0 and 14. All tested negative on both occasions. Only three individuals belonging to different districts in Kerala were found to be positive. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Sudden emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential to cause a pandemic posed an unsurmountable challenge to the public health system of India. However, concerted efforts of various arms of the Government of India resulted in a well-coordinated action at each level. India has successfully demonstrated its ability to establish quick diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 at NIV, Pune, and the testing VRDLs.","Gupta, Nivedita; Potdar, Varsha; Praharaj, Ira; Giri, Sidhartha; Sapkal, Gajanan; Yadav, Pragya; Choudhary, Manohar Lal; Dar, Lalit; Sugunan, A.P.; Kaur, Harmanmeet; Munivenkatappa, Ashok; Shastri, Jayanthi; Kaveri, Krishnasamy; Dutta, Shanta; Malhotra, Bharti; Jain, Amita; Nagamani, Kammilli; Shantala, G.B.; Raut, Sharmila; Vegad, M.M.; Sharma, Ajanta; Choudhary, Aashish; Brijwal, Megha; Balakrishnan, Anukumar; Manjunatha, Jayaswamy; Pathak, Manish; Srinivasan, Sivasubramanian; Banu, Hasina; Sharma, Himanshu; Jain, Parul; Sunita, Pakalpati; Ambica, R.; Fageria, Babita; Patel, Disha; Rajbongshi, Gitika; Vijay, Neetu; Narayan, Jitendra; Aggarwal, Neeraj; Nagar, Anu; Gangakhedkar, Raman R.; Abraham, Priya",Indian J Med Res,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_594_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32242875/,282
665363,Virtual Experience of Perioperative Patients: Walking in the Patients’ Shoes Using Virtual Reality and Blended Learning,2021-06-15,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has generated a global pandemic and no vaccine or antiviral drugs exist at the moment of writing. An attractive coronavirus drug target is the main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CLpro) because of its vital role in the viral cycle. A significant body of work has been focused on finding inhibitors which bind and block the active site of the main protease, but little has been done to address potential non-competitive inhibition which targets regions beyond the active site, partly because the fundamental biophysics of such allosteric control is still poorly understood. In this work, we construct an Elastic Network Model (ENM) of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro homodimer protein and analyse the dynamics and thermodynamics of the main proteases ENM. We found a rich and heterogeneous dynamical structure in the correlated motions, including allosterically correlated motions between the homodimeric proteases active sites. Exhaustive 1-point and 2-point mutation scans of the ENM and their effect on fluctuation free energies confirm previously experimentally identified bioactive residues, but also suggest several new candidate regions that are distant from the active site for control of the protease function. Our results suggest new dynamically-driven control regions as possible candidates for non-competitive inhibiting binding sites in the protease, which may assist the development of current fragmentbased binding screens. The results also provide new insight into the protein physics of fluctuation allostery and its underpinning dynamical structure.","Dubanevics, Igors; McLeish, Tom C",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.21.105965,282

The m.1555A>G variant predisposes to ototoxicity after aminoglycoside administration and has a prevalence of 1 in 500. Current genetic testing can take over 24 hours, an unacceptable delay in the acute setting. This prospective-observational trial will implement a rapid point of care test (POCT), facilitating tailored antibiotic prescribing to avoid hearing loss. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The genedrive POCT can detect the m.1555A>G variant in 26 min from buccal swab. This system will be integrated into the clinical pathways at two large UK neonatal centres over a minimum 6-month period. The primary outcome is the number of neonates successfully tested for the variant out of all babies prescribed antibiotics. As a secondary outcome, clinical timings will be compared with data collected prior to implementation, measuring the impact on routine practice. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval for the trial was granted by the Research Ethics Committee (REC) and Human Research Authority in August 2019.

Emergency Medical Services workers are already a high-risk group due to their professional development. The research project aimed to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on EMS professionals in terms of their mental health. For this purpose, we present a descriptive crosssectional study with survey methodology. A total of 317 EMS workers (doctors, nurses, and emergency medical technicians) were recruited voluntarily. Psychological distress, post-traumatic stress disorder, and insomnia were assessed. The instruments were the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS-8), and the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS-8). We found that 36% of respondents had psychological distress, 30.9% potentially had PTSD, and 60.9% experienced insomnia. Years of work experience were found to be positively correlated, albeit with low effect, with the PTSD score (r = 0.133). Finally, it can be stated that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a traumatic event for EMS workers. The number of professionals presenting psychological distress, possible PTSD, or insomnia increased dramatically during the early phases of the pandemic. This study highlights the need for mental health disorder prevention programmes for EMS workers in the face of a pandemic.","Martínez-Caballero, Carmen M.; Cárdaba-García, Rosa M.; Varas-Manovel, Rocío; García-Sanz, Laura M.; Martínez-Piedra, Jorge; Fernández-Carbajo, Juan J.; Pérez-Pérez, Lucía; Madrigal-Fernández, Miguel A.; Barba-Pérez, M.

SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mucosal samples, including rectal swabs, as late as 15 days post-exposure. Marked inflammation and coagulopathy in blood and tissues were prominent features. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated stimulation of interferon and interleukin 6 pathways in bronchoalveolar lavage samples and repression of natural killer cell- and T cell-associated transcripts in peripheral blood. Despite a slight waning in antibody titers after primary challenge, enhanced antibody and cellular responses contributed to rapid clearance after re-challenge with an identical strain.

They have been shown to be produced and released by many different types of healthy and diseased cells. Exosomes are secreted by all types of cells in culture, and are also found in various body fluids including blood, saliva, urine, and breast milk. Exosomes are essential for healthy physiological as well as pathological processes. In addition to their normal function, exosomes are involved in the development and progression of various diseases, potentiating cellular stress and damage. Pathogens take advantage of exosome release from infected host cells by manipulating host-derived exosomes to evade the immune system responses. Exosomes are involved in other pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases, liver diseases, heart failure, cancer, diabetes, kidney diseases, osteoporosis and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Hence, we can exploit exosomes as biomarkers and vaccines and modify them rationally for therapeutic interventions including tissue engineering. Further studies on exosomes will explore their potential and provide new methodology for effective clinical diagnostics and therapeutic strategies: such uses can be called exosome theragnostics.

On 30 January, WHO declared the new disease as a PHEIC, then as a Pandemic on 11 March. By mid-March, the virus spread widely; Djibouti was not spared and was hit by the pandemic with the first case detected on 17 March. Djibouti worked with WHO and other partners to develop a preparedness and response plan, and implemented a series of intervention measures. MoH together with its civilian and military partners, closely followed WHO recommended strategy based on four pillars: testing, isolating, early case management, and contact tracing. From 17 March to 16 May, Djibouti performed the highest per capita tests in Africa and isolated, treated and traced the contacts of each positive case, which allowed for a rapid control of the epidemic. Methods: COVID-19 data included in this study was collected through MoH Djibouti during the period from 17 March to 16 May 2020. Results: A total of 1,401 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were included in the study with 4 related deaths (CFR: 0.3%) and an attack rate of 0.15%. Males represented (68.4%) of the cases, with the age group 31-45 years old (34.2%) as the most affected. Djibouti conducted 17,532 tests, and was considered as a champion for COVID-19 testing in Africa with 18.2 tests per 1000 habitant. All positive cases were isolated, treated and had their contacts traced, which led to early and proactive diagnosis of cases and in turn yielded up to 95-98% asymptomatic cases. Recoveries reached 69% of the infected cases with R0 (0.91). The virus was detected in 4 regions in the country, with the highest percentage in the capital (83%).

Our results show that changes in adherence were empirically meaningful and geographically widespread. While a low-cost and habituating behaviour (mask wearing) exhibited a linear rise in adherence, high-cost and sensitizing behaviours (physical distancing) declined, but this decline decelerated over time, with small rebounds seen in later months. Reductions in adherence to physical distancing showed little difference across societal groups, but were less intense in countries with high interpersonal trust.

Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is a well-established, safe, viral vector for gene delivery with multiple naturally occurring and artificial serotypes available displaying alternate cell, tissue, and species-specific tropisms. Efficient AAV serotypes for the transduction of the conducting airways have been identified for several species; however, efficient serotypes for human lung parenchyma have not yet been identified. Here, we screened the ability of multiple AAV serotypes to transduce lung bud organoids (LBOs)—a model of human lung parenchyma generated from human embryonic stem cells. Microinjection of LBOs allowed us to model transduction from the luminal surface, similar to dosing via vector inhalation. We identified the naturally occurring rAAV2 and rAAV6 serotypes, along with synthetic rAAV6 variants, as having tropism for the human lung parenchyma. Positive staining of LBOs for surfactant proteins B and C confirmed distal lung identity and suggested the suitability of these vectors for the transduction of alveolar type II cells. Our findings establish LBOs as a new model for pulmonary gene therapy and stress the relevance of LBOs as a viral infection model of the lung parenchyma as relevant in SARS-CoV-2 research.","Meyer-Berg, Helena; Zhou Yang, Lucia; Pilar de Lucas, María; Zambrano, Alberto; Hyde, Stephen C.; Gill, Deborah R.",Stem Cell Res Ther,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-020-01950-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33097094/,282

Since then, Alu were involved in the most fundamental epigenetic mechanisms, namely reprogramming, pluripotency, imprinting and mosaicism. These Alu encode a family of retrotransposons transcribed by the RNA Pol III machinery, notably when the cytosines that constitute their sequences are de-methylated. Then, Alu hijack the functions of ORF2 encoded by another transposons named L1 during reverse transcription and integration into new sites. That mechanism functions as a complex genetic parasite able to copy-paste Alu sequences. Doing that, Alu have modified even the size of the human genome, as well as of other primate genomes, during 65 million years of co-evolution. Actually, one germline retro-transposition still occurs each 20 births. Thus, Alu continue to modify our human genome nowadays and were implicated in de novo mutation causing diseases including deletions, duplications and rearrangements. Most recently, retrotransposons were found to trigger neuronal diversity by inducing mosaicism in the brain. Finally, boosted during viral infections, Alu clearly interact with the innate immune system. The purpose of that review is to give a condensed overview of all these major findings that concern the fascinating physiology of Alu from their discovery up to the current knowledge.","Stenz, Ludwig",Mol Biol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725281/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06258-4,282

669905,Physical Activity and Social Network Use of Adolescents in Overweight and Obesity Treatment,2021-06-28,"Abstract Context The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in a global health emergency, the like of which has never been seen before. Prostate cancer (PCa) services across the globe have been on hold due to changing medical and surgical priorities. There is also epidemiological evidence that PCa patients have increased incidence and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection due to gender differences, age, and higher propensity for risk factors (eg, respiratory disease, obesity, hypertension, and smoking status). Objective To contribute to the emerging body of knowledge on the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection to PCa patients and, in the face of PCa treatment delays, provide evidence-based recommendations for ongoing management of specific PCa patient groups. Evidence acquisition A literature search was performed using all sources (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Libraries, and Web of Science) as well as the media to harness emerging data on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and its influence on PCa. Eligibility criteria were originality of data and relevance to PCa management. The authors note that during these unprecedented times, retrospective data are constantly being updated from multiple sources globally. Evidence synthesis A total of 72 articles and data sources were found initially. Owing to repetition, lack of originality, or nonrelevance, six articles were rejected, leaving 23 retrospective studies, seven basic science research articles, 15 societal and journal guidelines, and 21 epidemiological data sources, from countries at different stages of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These were analyzed qualitatively to produce evidence-based guidelines for the management of PCa patients at different stages of the patient journey, with strategies to reduce the risk of viral spread. Conclusions PCa patients may have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as morbidity and mortality if infected. Once appropriately triaged, and to reduce viral spread, PCa patients can have surveillance by telemedicine, and institute lifestyle changes and social quarantining measures. If risk stratification suggests that treatment should be planned, androgen deprivation therapy can be started, or potentially surgery or radiation therapy is possible on a case-by-case basis. Patient summary Prostate cancer patients can be followed up remotely until the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic resolves, but higher-risk cases may have treatment expedited to limit any negative impact on prostate cancer outcomes.","Dovey, Zachary; Mohamed, Nihal; Gharib, Yasmine; Ratnani, Parita; Hammouda, Nada; Nair, Sujit; Chakravarty, Dimple; Stanislaw, Sobotka; Lantz, Anna; Wiklund, Peter; Kyprianou, Natasha; Tewari, Ash",European urology open science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173542/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666168320351120; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euros.2020.05.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666168320351120?v=s5,282

In total, 160 young adults participated in this study. Two clinical groups (n = 97) were defined: excessive gaming users diagnosed with internet gaming disorder (IGD) (n = 64) and the high-risk users (n = 33). The control group (n = 63) was also divided into regular gamers (n = 14) and non-gamers (n = 49). Participants completed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV and self-reported questionnaires regarding IGD severity and gaming hours. The IGD group had significantly lower Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ), Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), and Processing Speed Index (PSI) scores, compared with regular gamers and non-gamers. The IGD group also exhibited lower Working Memory Index (WMI) scores, compared with non-gamers. The high-risk group demonstrated significantly lower PSI score, compared with non-gamers. Furthermore FSIQ, VCI, WMI, and PSI scores were significant predictors of gaming hours in the IGD group. For the high-risk group, FSIQ, WMI, and VCI scores were negatively associated with gaming hours. Our study demonstrates the need to address the importance of enhancing working memory and verbal ability, thus, preventing the development of gaming addiction among individuals at high-risk gamers.","Jang, Joon Hwan; Chung, Sun Ju; Choi, Aruem; Lee, Ji Yoon; Kim, Bomi; Park, Minkyung; Park, Susan; Choi, Jung-Seok",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34070386/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10112293,282

Rather than providing a simple chronological account, we have examined and attempted to explain the thought processes, advances in synthetic chemistry and lessons learned from antiviral testing that led to a few molecules being moved forward to eventual approval for human therapies, while others were discarded. The present paper focuses on early, relatively simplistic changes made to the nucleoside scaffold, beginning with modifications of the nucleoside sugars of Ara-C and other arabinose-derived nucleoside analogues in the 1960's. A future paper will review more recent developments, focusing especially on more complex modifications, particularly those involving multiple changes to the nucleoside scaffold. We hope that these articles will help virologists and others outside the field of medicinal chemistry to understand why certain drugs were successfully developed, while the majority of candidate compounds encountered barriers due to low-yielding synthetic routes, toxicity or other problems that led to their abandonment.","Seley-Radtke, Katherine L.; Yates, Mary K.",Antiviral Research,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354218300500; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.04.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354218300500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29649496/,282

In the presence of limited vaccine supply, this policy choice is a pressing issue for several countries worldwide, and the adopted course of action will affect the extension or easing of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the next months. We employ a suitably generalised, age-structure, stochastic SEIR (Susceptible -> Exposed -> Infectious -> Removed) epidemic model that can accommodate quantitative descriptions of the major effects resulting from distinct vaccination strategies. The different rates of social contacts among distinct age-groups are informed by a recent survey conducted in Greece. The results are summarised and evaluated in terms of the total number of deaths and infections as well as life years lost. The optimal strategy is found to be one based on fully vaccinating the elderly/at risk as quickly as possible, while extending the time-interval between the two vaccine doses to 12 weeks for all individuals below 75 years old, in agreement with epidemic theory which suggests targeting a combination of susceptibility and infectivity. This policy, which is similar to the approaches adopted in the UK and in Canada, is found to be effective in reducing deaths and life years lost in the period while vaccination is still being carried out.","Barbounakis, P.; Demiris, N.; Pavlakis, G.

Although community ecology approaches have been used to identify pathogen interactions at the within-host scale, methodologies enabling robust identification of interactions from population-scale data such as that available from health authorities are lacking. To address this gap, we developed a statistical framework that jointly identifies interactions between multiple viruses from contemporaneous non-stationary infection time series. Our conceptual approach is derived from a Bayesian multivariate disease mapping framework. Importantly, our approach captures within- and between-year dependencies in infection risk while controlling for confounding factors such as seasonality, demographics and infection frequencies, allowing genuine pathogen interactions to be distinguished from simple correlations. We validated our framework using a broad range of synthetic data. We then applied it to diagnostic data available for five respiratory viruses co-circulating in a major urban population between 2005 and 2013: adenovirus, human coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus. We found positive and negative covariances indicative of epidemiological interactions among specific virus pairs. This statistical framework enables a community ecology perspective to be applied to infectious disease epidemiology with important utility for public health planning and preparedness.","Mair, Colette; Nickbakhsh, Sema; Reeve, Richard; McMenamin, Jim; Reynolds, Arlene; Gunson, Rory N.; Murcia, Pablo R.; Matthews, Louise",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31834896/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007492,282

The background of mindfulness and SY practice are discussed and the emotional, neuroendocrine, and neurobiological responses are examined. Next, a rapid review of the literature examined six studies, published between 2010 and 2020 to determine what is known regarding the relationship between SY, mindfulness, and psychological wellbeing. The studies included 21–360 participants with a mean age of 20–55 years. The results demonstrated a significant positive correlation between nature, mindfulness, and measures of psychological wellbeing. During uncertain events, including COVID-19, weaving mindfulness with SY may be specifically important to at-risk groups, those experiencing depression, loneliness, and social isolation, and at-risk populations such as college students, veterans, and professionals with high levels of stress.

DESIGN: Ecological study. SETTING: Continental France administrative areas (départements; henceforth counties). The study period, from 18 March to 30 May 2020, corresponds to the main first outbreak period in France. POPULATION: COVID-19-linked in-hospital deaths. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In-hospital deaths and demographics (population, human density, male sex and population percentage >59 years old) were obtained from national and centralised public databases. County weather indexes were calculated by the French National Meteorological Agency. METHODS: In this observational ecological study, the relationship between in-hospital COVID-19-related mortality and climate zones in continental French counties were analysed, by comparing the cumulative in-hospital death tolls in France by county to other factors (population density, climate, age and sex). The study period lasted from 18 March to 30 May 2020. A multivariate linear-regression analysis of in-hospital mortality included climate zones, population density, population >59 years old and percentages of males as potential predictors. The significance level was set at 5%. RESULTS: Weather indicators and population density were factors independently associated with the COVID-19 death toll. Colder counties had significantly higher mortality rates (p<0.00001). Percentages of males and population >59 years old in counties did not affect COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Many parameters influence COVID-19 outbreak-severity indicators. Population density is a strong factor but its exact importance is difficult to discern. Weather (mainly cold winter temperatures) was independently associated with mortality and could help explain outbreak dynamics, which began and were initially more severe in the coldest counties of continental France. Weather partly explains fatality-rate discrepancies observed worldwide.","Mejdoubi, Mehdi; Djennaoui, Mehdi; Kyndt, Xavier",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33707270/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043269,282

Objective The primary objective of this study was to investigate the views of pharmacists about pharmacist- ordered and administered COVID-19 testing. Methods A 13-item questionnaire was developed to survey pharmacists who currently hold an active license in Rhode Island. Results One hundred and twenty-two pharmacists (13.8%) consented and responded to at least one question of the survey. The results indicated that the primary concern of pharmacists in regard to performing COVID-19 testing was spreading the infection to family members (71.3%). Becoming personally infected (59.8%) and not having access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (62.3%) were the second and third most common concern of pharmacists.

The main capsid protein in the best-studied family Herpesviridae contains a domain with HK97-like fold related to bacteriophage head proteins, and several virion maturation factors are also homologous between phages and herpesviruses. The origin of herpesvirus DNA replication proteins is less well understood. While analyzing the genomes of herpesviruses in the family Malacohepresviridae, we identified nearly 30 families of proteins conserved in other herpesviruses, including several phage-related domains in morphogenetic proteins. Herpesvirus DNA replication factors have complex evolutionary history: some are related to cellular proteins, but others are closer to homologs from large nucleocytoplasmic DNA viruses. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the core replication machinery of herpesviruses may have been recruited from the same pool as in the case of other large DNA viruses of eukaryotes.","Mushegian, Arcady; Karin, Eli Levy; Pupko, Tal",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217303513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29065352/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217303513; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.10.009,282

Methods: We assessed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and a diagnosis of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome at our institution from April 1 to June 24, 2020. We performed a literature search to capture all known published cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Results: There were 2 cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in the setting of coronavirus 2019 at our institution during a 3-month period. One patient was treated with anakinra, an interleukin-1 inhibitor that may disrupt endothelial function. The second patient had an underlying human immunodeficiency virus infection. We found 13 total cases in our literature search, which reported modest blood pressure fluctuations and a range of risk factors for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. One patient was treated with tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 inhibitor that may have effects on endothelial function. All patients had an improvement in their neurological symptoms. Interval imaging, when available, showed radiographic improvement of brain lesions. Conclusions: Risk factors for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 may include underlying infection or immunomodulatory agents with endothelial effects in conjunction with modest blood pressure fluctuations. We found that the neurological prognosis for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 infection is favorable. Recognition of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in this patient population is critical for prognostication and initiation of treatment, which may include cessation of potential offending agents and tight blood pressure control.","Anand, Pria; Lau, K.

675668,Assessing Patient-Perceived Hospital Service Quality and Sentiment in Malaysian Public Hospitals Using Machine Learning and Facebook Reviews,2021-09-21,"Background and objective The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the shift towards remote consultations in the medical field, including musculoskeletal (MSK) appointments. General practitioner (GP) registrars are now routinely conducting many MSK consultations remotely; however, very little is known of their level of confidence and satisfaction regarding this new and evolving scenario, or how this may impact patient management of patients. In this study, we aimed to understand GP registrars' level of confidence and satisfaction with respect to remote MSK consultations, and the perceived impact on patient management. Study design This study involved a cross-sectional online survey of GP registrars in the West Midlands, which was conducted in January 2021. Methods The survey asked for ranked responses to questions comparing face-to-face consulting methods with remote consulting, focusing on confidence, satisfaction, onward investigations, and referral activity. Statistical analysis was performed using the R software version 4.0.3. Results The overall survey response was 21.2% (n=312/1,471). Of the respondents, 85.9% of GP registrars had not received any training to prepare them for remote MSK consultations. GP registrars generally felt that they were more confident when treating patients face-to-face compared to remote consultations (p<0.001). This was true for general MSK complaints as well as specific assessments of the hand, shoulder, spine, hip, knee, and ankle; 36.2% of GP registrars were not satisfied and 51.0% thought that their patients were not satisfied with the current quality of remote MSK consultations. Of note, 77.6% of GP registrars said that they were more likely to request additional investigations, and 75.6% stated that they were more likely to refer patients to a specialist after a remote MSK consultation. Conclusion This study highlights the need for further training to better equip primary care doctors for remote MSK consultations. With tailored training, GP registrars could offer more streamlined remote patient care for MSK complaints.","Sahni, Manroy; Choudhry, Jamaal; Mittal, Ankush; Bhogal, Gurjit",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.15084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34150413/,282

676498,Does Smoking Protect against Being Hospitalized for COVID-19?,2020-12-21,"INTRODUCTION: The new coronavirus disease 2019 is an emerging respiratory disease caused by the highly contagious novel coronavirus which has currently overwhelmed the world. Realizing a comprehensive set of infection prevention measures is a key to minimize the spread of this virus and its impacts in all healthcare settings. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the compliance towards COVID-19 preventive measures and associated factors among health professionals in selected public hospitals, southeast Ethiopia. METHODS: A descriptive hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 660 health professionals in public hospitals of southeast Ethiopia from October 1 to 31, 2020. A multistage sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Data were collected by interview using structured and pretested questionnaires. Ordinary logistic regression modeling was used to estimate the crude and adjusted odds ratio. To declare the statistical significance of factors associated with the outcome variable, P-value < 0.05 and 95% confidence interval were used. RESULTS: A total of 654 health professionals were involved in the study; of whom, 313 participants were nurses. The overall good compliance and knowledge of health professionals regarding COVID-19 preventive measures were 21.6 and 25.5%, respectively. Working in the general hospital (AOR = 0.55; 95% CI 0.38, 0.79), service year (AOR = 2.10; 95% CI 1.35, 3.21), knowledge (AOR = 1.80; 95% CI 1.14, 2.89), and water availability (AOR = 3.26; 95% CI 2.25, 4.72) were some of the factors found to have a statistically significant association to compliance of health professionals regarding COVID-19 preventive measures. CONCLUSION: In this study, nearly one fifth of health professionals had good compliance towards COVID-19 prevention practices. Thus, a consistent supply of COVID-19 prevention materials, facilities, and improving the knowledge of health professionals through on and off-job training are crucial.","Zenbaba, Demisu; Sahiledengle, Biniyam; Takele, Abulie; Tekalegn, Yohannes; Yassin, Ahmed; Tura, Birhanu; Abdulkadir, Adem; Tesa, Edao; Tasew, Alelign; Ganfure, Gemechu; Fikadu, Genet; Seyoum, Kenbon; Abduku, Mohammedawel; Assefa, Tesfaye; Morka, Garoma; Kemal, Makida; Gemechu, Adisu; Bekele, Kebebe; Tessema, Abdi; Haji, Safi; Haile, Gebisa; Girma, Alemu; Mama, Mohammedaman; Negero, Asfaw; Nigussie, Eshetu; Gezahegn, Habtamu; Atlaw, Daniel; Regasa, Tadele; Usman, Heyder; Esmael, Adem",Trop Med Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41182-021-00318-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33863397/,282

Patients commonly present with respiratory tract symptoms and fever. However two third are asymptomatic and unusual presentation is evolving. This has cause management dilemma among physicians. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 35 year young otherwise healthy male presented to emergency department of this institute with fever of 103o F, abdominal pain, and pancytopenia with progressive fall in hemoglobin level was tested positive for COVID-19. Contrast enhance computed tomography of the patient revealed hemoperitoneum with splenic infarct. He was admitted in intensive care unit and managed with supportive treatment. DISCUSSION: Respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms with hematological abnormalities like lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia were common presentation of COVID-19. Although coagulopathy and vasculitis has been a well-documented entity in patients with COIVD-19, visceral infarction leading to spontaneous hemoperitoeum was unusual and rare clinical presentation. CONCLUSION: A high degree of clinical suspicion and thorough evaluation helps in diagnosis of COVID-19 and related complications.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus was first registered in Brazil on March 2020, and its social and economic repercussions have been catastrophic. This paper investigates how to apply model predictive control (MPC) algorithms to plan appropriate social distancing policies that mitigate the pandemic effects. We consider MPC applications for the states of Bahia and Santa Catarina (Brazil), two regions of very different social and cultural demographics. We use Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased model to describe the pandemic dynamics in these two states, for which parameters are identified using a constrained optimization procedure. The control input to the process is a social isolation guideline passed to the population. Two MPC frameworks are developed and discussed: (a) a centralized approach, which coordinates a single predictive control policy for both states, and (b) a distributed strategy, for which a single MPC problem is solved for each state. We provide a series of simulation results in order to illustrate and compare the results obtained with both these MPC strategies. Discussions are drawn regarding the effectiveness of MPC to guide social distancing measures during pandemics and which approach (distributed, centralized) is more convenient, regarding different conditions.","Pataro, Igor M.

677438,Determinants of Travel Participation and Experiences of Wheelchair Users Traveling to the Bodrum Region: A Qualitative Study,2021-02-24,"RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of gene silencing induced by double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). Among the widely used dsRNAs, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and short hairpin RNAs have evolved as extremely powerful and the most popular gene silencing reagents. The key challenge to achieving efficient gene silencing especially for the purpose of therapeutics is mainly dependent on the effectiveness and specificity of the selected RNAi-targeted sequences. Practically, only a small number of dsRNAs are capable of inducing highly effective and sequence-specific gene silencing via RNAi mechanism. In addition, the efficiency of gene silencing induced by dsRNAs can only be experimentally examined based on inhibition of the target gene expression. Therefore, it is essential to develop a fully robust and comparative validation system for measuring the efficacy of designed dsRNAs. In this chapter, we focus our discussion on a reliable and quantitative reporter-based siRNA validation system that has been previously established in our laboratory. The system consists of a short synthetic DNA fragment containing an RNAi-targeted sequence of interest and two expression vectors for targeting reporter and triggering siRNA expressions. The efficiency of siRNAs is determined by their abilities to inhibit expression of the targeting reporters with easily quantified readouts including enhanced green fluorescence protein and firefly luciferase. Since only a readily available short synthetic DNA fragment is needed for constructing this reliable and efficient reporter-based siRNA validation system, this system not only provides a powerful strategy for screening highly effective RNAi-targeted sequences from mammalian genes but also implicates the use of RNAi-based dsRNA reagents for reverse functional genomics and molecular therapeutics.","Tsai, Wen-Hui; Chang, Wen-Tsan",Gene Function Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-62703-721-1_15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24233788/,282

Mefloquine, a human anti-malarial agent, has been shown to inhibit FIPV in vitro. As a first step to evaluate its efficacy and safety profile as a potential FIP treatment for cats, mefloquine underwent incubation in feline, canine and common brush-tailed possum microsomes and phase I metabolism cofactors to determine its rate of phase I depletion. Tramadol was used as a phase I positive control as it undergoes this reaction in both dogs and cats. Using the substrate depletion method, the in vitro intrinsic clearance (mean ± S.D.) of mefloquine by pooled feline and common brush-tailed possum microsomes was 4.5 ± 0.35 and 18.25 ± 3.18 μL/min/mg protein, respectively. However, phase I intrinsic clearance was too slow to determine with canine microsomes. Liquid chromatography—mass spectrometry (LC-MS) identified carboxymefloquine in samples generated by feline microsomes as well as negative controls, suggesting some mefloquine instability. Mefloquine also underwent incubation with feline, canine and common brush-tailed possum microsomes and phase II glucuronidative metabolism cofactors. O-desmethyltramadol (ODMT or M1) was used as a positive control as it undergoes a phase II glucuronidation reaction in these species. The rates of phase II mefloquine depletion by microsomes by all three species were too slow to estimate. Therefore mefloquine likely undergoes phase I hepatic metabolism catalysed by feline and common brush-tailed possum microsomes but not phase II glucuronidative metabolism in all three species and mefloquine is not likely to have delayed elimination in cats with clinically normal, hepatic function.","Izes, Aaron Michael; Kimble, Benjamin; Norris, Jacqueline Marie; Govendir, Merran",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287278/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230975,282
678226,DANGER! Crisis Health Workers at Risk,2020-07-22,"Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease that is caused by a mutation of the NPC1 or NPC2 gene, in which un-esterified cholesterol and sphingolipids accumulate mainly in the liver, spleen, and brain. Abnormal lysosomal storage leads to cell damage, neurological problems, and premature death. The time of onset and severity of symptoms of NPC disease are highly variable. The molecular mechanisms that are responsible for NPC disease pathology are far from being understood. The present study generated and characterized a zebrafish mutant that lacks Npc2 protein that may be useful for studies at the organismal, cellular, and molecular levels and both small-scale and high-throughput screens. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we knocked out the zebrafish homolog of NPC2. Five-day-old npc2 mutants were morphologically indistinguishable from wildtype larvae. We found that live npc2(–/–) larvae exhibited stronger Nile blue staining. The npc2(–/–) larvae exhibited low mobility and a high anxiety-related response. These behavioral changes correlated with downregulation of the mcu (mitochondrial calcium uniporter) gene, ppp3ca (calcineurin) gene, and genes that are involved in myelination (mbp and mpz). Histological analysis of adult npc2(–/–) zebrafish revealed that pathological changes in the nervous system, kidney, liver, and pancreas correlated with inflammatory responses (i.e., the upregulation of il1, nfκβ, and mpeg; i.e., hallmarks of NPC disease). These findings suggest that the npc2 mutant zebrafish may be a model of NPC disease.","Wiweger, Malgorzata; Majewski, Lukasz; Adamek-Urbanska, Dobrochna; Wasilewska, Iga; Kuznicki, Jacek",Front Cell Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33986646/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2021.647860,282
678556,Corona Virus (COVID-19) “Infodemic” and Emerging Issues through a Data Lens: The Case of China,2020-03-30,"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) place a huge burden on healthcare systems and society as a whole. Relatively early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, clinicians became aware that in individuals infected with COVID-19, those with preexisting NCDs such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (CVD) were at a greater risk of poor outcomes and mortality than those without. The importance of adherence to medications and lifestyle changes to control and prevent NCDs has been a major focus for many years, but with limited success – the proportion of patients adherent and persistent to their medications remains very low. There are many facets to adherence and persistence. Recent evidence suggests that a patient-centric approach is important, and ensuring that a patient is both motivated and empowered is critical to improving adherence/persistence. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many changes to the way in which patients with NCDs are managed, with telemedicine and ehealth becoming more common. Changes have also occurred in the way in which patients can gain access to medications during the pandemic. The potential for these changes forms the basis of improving the management of patients with NCDs both during and after the pandemic. Over the coming months, a huge amount of work will be put into initiatives to promote adherence to COVID-19 vaccination programs. Those at highest risk of severe COVID-19, such as people aged 80 years and older, are likely to receive the vaccine first in some parts of world. Finally, social determinants of health are critical elements that can impact not just the likelihood of having an NCD or becoming infected with COVID-19, but also access to healthcare, and a patient’s adherence and persistence with their treatments.","Hassan, Tarek A; Sáenz, Jorge Enrique; Ducinskiene, Danute; Cook, Joseph P; Imperato, Joseph S; Zou, Kelly H",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34522102/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s313626,282

Understanding these gaps using real-world, routine care data will improve our understanding of the challenges and consequences faced by patients with CKD, and will facilitate the long-term goal of improving their management and prognosis. METHODS: DISCOVER CKD follows an enriched hybrid study design, with both retrospective and prospective patient cohorts, integrating primary and secondary data from patients with CKD from China, Italy, Japan, Sweden, the UK and the USA. Data will be prospectively captured over a 3-year period from >1000 patients with CKD who will be followed up for at least 1 year via electronic case report form entry during routine clinical visits and also via a mobile/tablet-based application, enabling the capture of patient-reported outcomes (PROs). In-depth interviews will be conducted in a subset of ∼100 patients. Separately, secondary data will be retrospectively captured from >2 000 000 patients with CKD, extracted from existing datasets and registries. RESULTS: The DISCOVER CKD program captures and will report on patient demographics, biomarker and laboratory measurements, medical histories, clinical outcomes, healthcare resource utilization, medications, dietary patterns, physical activity and PROs (including QoL and qualitative interviews).

This paper aims to optimize the disease surveillance process by further identifying the infectious or recovered period of flu cases through social media. Specifically, this paper explores the potential of using public sentiment to detect flu periods at word level. At text level, we constructed a deep learning method to classify the flu period and improve the classification result with sentiment polarity. Three important findings are revealed. Firstly, bloggers in different periods express significantly different sentiments. Blogger sentiments in the recovered period are more positive than in the infectious period when measured by the interclass distance. Secondly, the optimized disease detection process can substantially improve the classification accuracy of flu periods from 0.876 to 0.926. Thirdly, our experimental results confirm that sentiment classification plays a crucial role in accuracy improvement. Precise identification of disease periods enhances the channels for the disease surveillance processes. Therefore, a disease outbreak can be predicted credibly when a larger population is monitored.

Over the last months, worldwide experience demonstrated that the ARDS in COVID-19 patients are in many ways “atypical”. The mortality rate in ventilated patients is high despite the application of the gold standard treatment (protective ventilation, curare, prone position, inhaled NO). Several studies suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 could interact negatively on red blood cell homeostasis. Furthermore, SarsCov2 creates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are toxic and generate endothelial dysfunction. Hypothesis/Objective(s) We hypothesis that HEMO2Life® administrated intravenously is safe and could help symptomatically the patient condition. It would increase arterial oxygen content despite lung failure and allow better tissue oxygenation control. The use of HEMO2Life® is also interesting due to its anti-oxidative effect preventing cytokine storm induced by the SARS-CoV-2. Evaluation of the hypothesis: Hemarina is based on the properties of the hemoglobin of the Arenicola marina sea-worm (HEMO2Life®). This extracellular hemoglobin has an oxygen capacity 40 times greater than the hemoglobin of vertebrates. Furthermore, the size of this molecule is 250 times smaller than a human red blood cell, allowing it to diffuse in all areas of the microcirculation, without diffusing outside the vascular sector. It possesses an antioxidative property du a Superoxide Dismutase Activity. This technology has been the subject of numerous publications and HEMO2Life® was found to be well-tolerated and did not induce toxicity. It was administered intravenously to hamsters and rats, and showed no acute effect on heart rate and blood pressure and did not cause microvascular vasoconstriction. In preclinical in vivo models (mice, rats, and dogs), HEMO2Life® has enabled better tissue oxygenation, especially in the brain. This molecule has already been used in humans in organ preservation solutions and the patients showed no abnormal clinical signs. CONSEQUENCES OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The expected benefits of HEMO2Life® for COVID-19 patients are improved survival, avoidance of tracheal intubation, shorter oxygen supplementation, and the possibility of treating a larger number of patients as molecular respirator without to use an invasive machine.","Lupon, Elise; Lellouch, Alexandre G.; Zal, Franck; Cetrulo, Curtis L.; Lantieri, Laurent A.",Med Hypotheses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33308935/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110421; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720333120?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720333120,282

Besides cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, encephalitis, hyposmia, the whole range of neurological complications due to SARSCoV-2 is still not well known. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Herein, we report a new case of COVID-19, associated with mononeuropathy with reversible conduction block (CB). After SARS-CoV-2 infection, the patient developed acute weakness of left peroneal muscles. He underwent an endovenous immunoglobulin treatment, and symptoms improved. Two electroneurographic exam (before and after treatment), showed a reversible CB on left peroneal nerve. Dosage of serum antiganglioside antibodies showed anti-GM1 IgM positivity.

679838,Comparison of a Barcode-Based Smartphone Application to a Questionnaire to Assess the Use of Cleaning Products at Home and Their Association with Asthma Symptoms,2021-03-24,"Background. Emerging evidences suggest that in severe COVID-19, multi-organ failure is associated with a hyperinflammatory state (the so-called “cytokine storm”) in combination with the development of a prothrombotic state. The central role of endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of the disease is to date accepted, but the precise mechanisms underlying the associated coagulopathy remain unclear. Whether the alterations in vascular homeostasis directly depend upon the SARS-CoV-2 infection of endothelial cells or, rather, occur secondarily to the activation of the inflammatory response is still a matter of debate. Here, we address the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein on the activation of human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC). In particular, the existence of an endothelium-macrophage crosstalk in the response to the spike protein has been explored. Methods and Results. The effect of the spike protein is addressed in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC), either directly or after incubation with a conditioned medium (CM) of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) previously activated by the spike S1 protein (CM-MDM). Both MDM and HLMVEC are activated in response to the S1 protein, with an increased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. However, when HLMVEC are exposed to CM-MDM, an enhanced cell activation occurs in terms of the expression of adhesion molecules, pro-coagulant markers, and chemokines. Under this experimental condition, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, the chemokines CXCL8/IL-8, CCL2/MCP1, and CXCL10/IP-10 as well as the protein tissue factor (TF) are markedly induced. Instead, a decrease of thrombomodulin (THBD) is observed. Conclusion. Our data suggest that pro-inflammatory mediators released by spike-activated macrophages amplify the activation of endothelial cells, likely contributing to the impairment of vascular integrity and to the development of a pro-coagulative endothelium.","Rotoli, Bianca Maria; Barilli, Amelia; Visigalli, Rossana; Ferrari, Francesca; Dall’Asta, Valeria",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34572407/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9091220,282

I estimate that with the promised rate of vaccinations, if no additional non-pharmaceutical interventions are implemented, 203 thousand additional lives will be lost and the future cost of the pandemic will reach $1.3 trillion, or 6% of GDP. Using a cost-benefit analysis, I assess whether it is optimal for the United States to follow the lead of many European countries and introduce a nation-wide lockdown. I find that a lockdown would be indeed optimal and, depending on the assumptions, it should last between two and four weeks and will generate a net benefit of up to $653 billion.","Scherbina, Anna",Econ Disaster Clim Chang,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33997600/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41885-021-00083-6,282

Based on past experience of accessing medicines for life-threatening diseases there is a justifiable fear that access to any vaccines and treatments that are eventually developed may be hindered by patents, leading to unaffordable prices. In particular, one of the reasons that typically leads to high prices is strategic patenting employed by pharmaceutical companies. While this practice is currently considered lawful, this article argues that strategic patenting requires a long-overdue intervention by competition authorities and aims to attract their attention to its harmful effects. It maintains that, along with a more immediate negative effect in the form of high drug prices, strategic patenting affects dynamic competition by stifling innovation of both originators and generic companies. The article outlines the current approach to strategic patenting and provides arguments for the intervention of competition law. This, in turn, will open the possibility for competition authorities to investigate this practice and prevent its harmful effect on drug prices and pharmaceutical innovation, for the benefit of consumer welfare.","Gurgula, Olga",IIC Int Rev Ind Prop Copyr Law,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33132411/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40319-020-00985-0,282

The use of type I interferons for coronavirus is still under great debate in clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search of all relevant studies published on PubMed, Cochrane library, Web of Science database, Science Direct, Wanfang Data, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) until February 2020 was performed. RESULTS: Of the 1081 identified articles, only 15 studies were included in the final analysis. Comorbidities and delay in diagnosis were significantly associated with case mortality. Type I interferons seem to improve respiratory distress, relieve lung abnormalities, present better saturation, reduce needs for supplemental oxygen support. Type I interferons seem to be well tolerated, and don’t increase life threating adverse effects. Data on IFNs in HCoVs are limited, heterogenous and mainly observational. CONCLUSIONS: Current data do not allow making regarding robust commendations for the use of IFNs in HCoVs in general or in specific subtype. But we still recommend type I interferons serving as first-line antivirals in HCoVs infections within local protocols, and interferons may be adopted to the treatments of the SARS-CoV-2 as well.

682706,Effects of Spatial Characteristics on the Spread of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in Korea,2021-04-13,"Abstract The rush to understand new socio-economic contexts created by the wide adoption of AI is justified by its far-ranging consequences, spanning almost every walk of life. Yet, the public sector's predicament is a tragic double bind: its obligations to protect citizens from potential algorithmic harms are at odds with the temptation to increase its own efficiency - or in other words - to govern algorithms, while governing by algorithms. Whether such dual role is even possible, has been a matter of debate, the challenge stemming from algorithms' intrinsic properties, that make them distinct from other digital solutions, long embraced by the governments, create externalities that rule-based programming lacks. As the pressures to deploy automated decision making systems in the public sector become prevalent, this paper aims to examine how the use of AI in the public sector in relation to existing data governance regimes and national regulatory practices can be intensifying existing power asymmetries. To this end, investigating the legal and policy instruments associated with the use of AI for strenghtening the immigration process control system in Canada; “optimising” the employment services” in Poland, and personalising the digital service experience in Finland, the paper advocates for the need of a common framework to evaluate the potential impact of the use of AI in the public sector. In this regard, it discusses the specific effects of automated decision support systems on public services and the growing expectations for governments to play a more prevalent role in the digital society and to ensure that the potential of technology is harnessed, while negative effects are controlled and possibly avoided. This is of particular importance in light of the current COVID-19 emergency crisis where AI and the underpinning regulatory framework of data ecosystems, have become crucial policy issues as more and more innovations are based on large scale data collections from digital devices, and the real-time accessibility of information and services, contact and relationships between institutions and citizens could strengthen – or undermine - trust in governance systems and democracy.","Kuziemski, Maciej; Misuraca, Gianluca",Telecomm Policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2020.101976; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308596120300689?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313360/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0308596120300689,282

Exploring the influencing factors and possible adverse consequences of albumin reduction may provide some guidance for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this multicentre retrospective study, we collected information including demographics, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, complications, laboratory tests, treatment, and outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from three hospitals in Wuhan, China. We compared the indexes between patients with hypoalbuminemia and normal albumin. Regression model was used to evaluate various influencing factors of patients with hypoalbuminemia and their relationship with clinical outcomes. We also compared the changes of particular laboratory indexes in patients with hypoalbuminemia before and after enteral nutrition therapy. RESULTS: A total of 482 patients were enrolled in the study. About 53.7% patients developed hypoalbuminemia during admission. Patients with hypoalbuminemia were older, had a higher proportion of combined diabetes mellitus, fever, dyspnea, and natriuresis, and had a relatively poorer prognosis than patients with normal albumin. Patients with hypoalbuminemia had higher levels of CRP, leukocytes, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, ALP, GGT, LDH, creatine kinase, D-dimer, globulin, and lower levels of lymphocytes and eosinophils. Severe, older, anorexia, elevated CRP, and decreased lymphocytes were the independent predictors for decreased albumin in COVID-19 patients. In addition, decreased albumin is correlated with adverse outcomes. Nutritional support therapy to correct serum albumin may improve patient outcomes. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with hypoalbuminemia tend to have more severe clinical manifestations and more abnormal biochemical tests, which may result in poorer clinical outcomes. Nutritional support therapy may improve the clinical outcome of these patients.","Chen, Chaoyue; Zhang, Ying; Zhao, Xi; Tao, Meihui; Yan, Wei; Fu, Yu",Infect Drug Resist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34526790/; https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s327090,282

An on-line sample of UK mothers (N = 710) of infants up to 12 weeks old completed the PSAS-RSF-C during COVID-19 ‘lockdown’. RESULTS: Principal component analyses on a randomly split sample (n = 344) revealed four factors, identical in nature to the original PSAS, which in combination explained 75% of the total variance. Confirmatory factor analyses (n = 366) demonstrated the four-factor model fit the data well. Reliability of the overall scale and of the underlying factors in both samples proved excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest the PSAS-RSF-C may prove useful as a clinical screening tool and is the first postpartum-specific psychometric scale to be validated during the COVID-19 pandemic. This offers psychometrically sound assessment of postpartum anxiety. By increasing the accessibility of the PSAS, we aim to enable researchers the opportunity to measure maternal anxiety, rapidly, at times of global crisis.","Silverio, Sergio A.; Davies, Siân M.; Christiansen, Paul; Aparicio-García, Marta E.; Bramante, Alessandra; Chen, Ping; Costas-Ramón, Natalia; de Weerth, Carolina; Della Vedova, Anna M.; Infante Gil, Lilliam; Lustermans, Hellen; Wendland, Jaqueline; Xu, Jihong; Halford, Jason C.

We analyze these trends until the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), we examine the financial and trade dynamics between the two currency areas and analyze the related risks and opportunities. The data point to several patterns. We find that financial volatility in China has been substantially greater than in the Eurozone. Even so, the largest and strongest Eurozone economies—France and Germany—have largely kept their investments in Chinese assets after a four- to sixfold expansion that started in the mid-2000s. In contrast, the financially weakest countries have accounted for the largest increases in trade volumes between China and the Eurozone. We also find that trade volumes are correlated with holdings of Chinese financial assets but assets rose at a substantially smaller rate than trade. These results show that China and the Eurozone continue to be asymmetrically integrated, whereby Eurozone countries still invest more timidly in Chinese financial assets compared to the aggressive trade and infrastructure partnerships initiated by China. We discuss the implications for future financial and trade integration between the two currency areas, which is bound to deepen in light of the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment.","Del Ponte, Alessandro; Canofari, Paolo; De Dominicis, Audrey",Asia Eur J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34099960/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10308-021-00619-1,282

Spain was one of the European countries with the highest incidence during the first wave. As a part of a consortium to monitor and study the evolution of the epidemic, we sequenced 2,170 samples, diagnosed mostly before lockdown measures. Here, we identified at least 500 introductions from multiple international sources and documented the early rise of two dominant Spanish epidemic clades (SECs), probably amplified by superspreading events. Both SECs were related closely to the initial Asian variants of SARS-CoV-2 and spread widely across Spain. We inferred a substantial reduction in the effective reproductive number of both SECs due to public-health interventions (R(e) < 1), also reflected in the replacement of SECs by a new variant over the summer of 2020. In summary, we reveal a notable difference in the initial genetic makeup of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain compared with other European countries and show evidence to support the effectiveness of lockdown measures in controlling virus spread, even for the most successful genetic variants.","López, Mariana G.; Chiner-Oms, Álvaro; García de Viedma, Darío; Ruiz-Rodriguez, Paula; Bracho, Maria Alma; Cancino-Muñoz, Irving; D’Auria, Giuseppe; de Marco, Griselda; García-González, Neris; Goig, Galo Adrian; Gómez-Navarro, Inmaculada; Jiménez-Serrano, Santiago; Martinez-Priego, Llúcia; Ruiz-Hueso, Paula; Ruiz-Roldán, Lidia; Torres-Puente, Manuela; Alberola, Juan; Albert, Eliseo; Aranzamendi Zaldumbide, Maitane; Bea-Escudero, María Pilar; Boga, Jose Antonio; Bordoy, Antoni E.; Canut-Blasco, Andrés; Carvajal, Ana; Cilla Eguiluz, Gustavo; Cordón Rodríguez, Maria Luz; Costa-Alcalde, José J.; de Toro, María; de Toro Peinado, Inmaculada; del Pozo, Jose Luis; Duchêne, Sebastián; Fernández-Pinero, Jovita; Fuster Escrivá, Begoña; Gimeno Cardona, Concepción; González Galán, Verónica; Gonzalo Jiménez, Nieves; Hernáez Crespo, Silvia; Herranz, Marta; Lepe, José Antonio; López-Causapé, Carla; López-Hontangas, José Luis; Martín, Vicente; Martró, Elisa; Milagro Beamonte, Ana; Montes Ros, Milagrosa; Moreno-Muñoz, Rosario; Navarro, David; Navarro-Marí, José María; Not, Anna; Oliver, Antonio; Palop-Borrás, Begoña; Parra Grande, Mónica; Pedrosa-Corral, Irene; Pérez González, Maria Carmen; Pérez-Lago, Laura; Pérez-Ruiz, Mercedes; Piñeiro Vázquez, Luis; Rabella, Nuria; Rezusta, Antonio; Robles Fonseca, Lorena; Rodríguez-Villodres, Ángel; Sanbonmatsu-Gámez, Sara; Sicilia, Jon; Soriano, Alex; Tirado Balaguer, María Dolores; Torres, Ignacio; Tristancho, Alexander; Marimón, José María; Coscolla, Mireia; González-Candelas, Fernando; Comas, Iñaki",Nat Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34594042/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-021-00936-6,282

The aim of this study is the evaluation of temporal connection between SARS-CoV-2 positive tests (cases) and deaths in Italy in the first wave of the epidemic. METHODS: A temporal link between cases and deaths was determined by comparing their daily/weekly trends using surveillance data of the period March 2–June 2020. RESULTS: The monitoring of the cases/deaths evolution during the first wave of the outbreak highlights a striking correlation between infections of a certain week and deaths of the following one. We defined a weekly lethality rate that is virtually unchanged over the entire months of April and May until the first week of June (≈13.6%). Due to the rather low number of cases/deaths, this parameter starts to fluctuate in the following three weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis indicates that the weekly lethality rate is virtually unchanged over the entire first wave of the epidemic, despite the progressive increase of the testing. As observed for the overall lethality, this parameter uniformly presents rather high values. The definition of a temporal link between cases and deaths will likely represent a useful tool for highlighting analogies and differences between the first and the second wave of the pandemic and for evaluating the effectiveness, even if partial, of the strategies applied during the ongoing outbreak.

In these troubled days the scientific community is asking rapid replies to prevent and combat the emergency. It is generally accepted that only achieving a better understanding of the interactions between the virus and host immune response and of the pathogenesis of infection is crucial to identify valid therapeutic tools to control virus entry, replication and spread as well as to impair its lethal effects. Based on the recent research progress of SARS-CoV-2 and the results on previous coronaviruses, in this contribution we underscore some of the main unsolved problems, mostly focusing on pathogenetic aspects and host immunity to the virus. On this basis, we also touch important aspects regarding the immune response in asymptomatic subjects, the immune-evasion of SARS-CoV-2 in severe patients and differences in disease severity by age and gender.","Maggi, Enrico; Canonica, Giorgio Walter; Moretta, Lorenzo",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009167492030631X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S009167492030631X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32389590/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.05.001,282

689131,Active Coping and Anxiety Symptoms during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Spanish Adults,2021-08-04,"Wild Canis species such as the coyote (C. latrans) express a suite of reproductive traits unusual among mammals, including perennial pair-bonds and paternal care of the young. Coyotes also are monestrous, and both sexes are fertile only in winter; thus, they depend upon social and physiologic synchrony for successful reproduction. To investigate the mutability of seasonal reproduction in coyotes, we attempted to evoke an out-of-season estrus in October using one of two short-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agents: (1) a GnRH analogue, deslorelin (6-d-tryptophan-9-(N-ethyl-l-prolinamide)-10-deglycinamide), 2.1 mg pellet sc; or (2) gonadorelin, a GnRH (5-oxoPro-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-GlyNH(2)) porcine hypothalamic extract, 2.0 μg/kg im once daily for 3 consecutive days. A transient increase in serum concentrations of estradiol and progesterone (1 and 2 wk, respectively) was detected after treatment with deslorelin but not gonadorelin. Also, socio-sexual behaviors reminiscent of winter mating (including courtship, mate-guarding, precoital mounts, and copulatory ties) were observed among the deslorelin group. During the subsequent breeding season (January and February), however, preovulatory courtship behavior and olfactory sampling appeared suppressed; emergence of mounts and copulations were delayed in both deslorelin and gonadorelin treatment groups. Furthermore, whereas 8 of 12 females treated in October ovulated and produced healthy litters in the spring, 4 naïve coyotes failed to copulate or become pregnant. Thus, perturbation of hormones prior to ovulation in species with complex mating behaviors may disrupt critical intrapair relationships, even if fertility is not impaired physiologically.","Carlson, D.A.; Gese, E.M.",Theriogenology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0093691X09002520; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093691X09002520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19631975/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.05.012,282

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: Community based SARS-CoV-2 testing in England, individually linked with hospital admission data. PARTICIPANTS: 839 278 patients with laboratory confirmed covid-19, of whom 36 233 had been admitted to hospital within 14 days, tested between 23 November 2020 and 31 January 2021 and analysed at a laboratory with an available TaqPath assay that enables assessment of S-gene target failure (SGTF), a proxy test for the B.1.1.7 variant. Patient data were stratified by age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, region of residence, and date of positive test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital admission between one and 14 days after the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: 27 710 (4.7%) of 592 409 patients with SGTF variants and 8523 (3.5%) of 246 869 patients without SGTF variants had been admitted to hospital within one to 14 days. The stratum adjusted hazard ratio of hospital admission was 1.52 (95% confidence interval 1.47 to 1.57) for patients with covid-19 infected with SGTF variants, compared with those infected with non-SGTF variants. The effect was modified by age (P<0.001), with hazard ratios of 0.93-1.21 in patients younger than 20 years with versus without SGTF variants, 1.29 in those aged 20-29, and 1.45-1.65 in those aged ≥30 years. The adjusted absolute risk of hospital admission within 14 days was 4.7% (95% confidence interval 4.6% to 4.7%) for patients with SGTF variants and 3.5% (3.4% to 3.5%) for those with non-SGTF variants. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the risk of hospital admission is higher for people infected with the B.1.1.7 variant compared with wild-type SARS-CoV-2, likely reflecting a more severe disease. The higher severity may be specific to adults older than 30 years.","Nyberg, Tommy; Twohig, Katherine A; Harris, Ross J; Seaman, Shaun R; Flannagan, Joe; Allen, Hester; Charlett, Andre; De Angelis, Daniela; Dabrera, Gavin; Presanis, Anne M",BMJ,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05560v3.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n1412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34130987/,282
689308,Predicting Breaststroke and Butterfly Stroke Results in Swimming Based on Olympics History,2021-06-20,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Currently, organoid research is having a growing impact in oncology. Tumor organoids, directly derived from patients’ specimens, can easily be expanded and cryopreserved. For that reason, they are becoming an indispensable ally in clinics for quicker diagnosis and prognosis of malignancies. Patient-derived cancer organoids are used as a platform to predict the efficacy of standard-of-care, as well as novel drugs. Therefore, this approach might be further utilized for validating off-label molecules, in order to widen the cancer care offer. ABSTRACT: Malignancies heterogeneity represents a critical issue in cancer care, as it often causes therapy resistance and tumor relapse. Organoids are three-dimensional (3D) miniaturized representations of selected tissues within a dish. Lately, organoid technology has been applied to oncology with growing success and Patients Derived Tumor Organoids (PDTOs) constitute a novel available tool which fastens cancer research. PDTOs are in vitro models of cancer, and importantly, they can be used as a platform to validate the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs. For that reason, they are currently utilized in clinics as emerging in vitro screening technology to tailor the therapy around the patient, with the final goal of beating cancer resistance and recurrence. In this sense, PDTOs biobanking is widely used and PDTO-libraries are helping the discovery of novel anticancer molecules. Moreover, they represent a good model to screen and validate compounds employed for other pathologies as off-label drugs potentially repurposed for the treatment of tumors. This will open up novel avenues of care thus ameliorating the life expectancy of cancer patients. This review discusses the present advancements in organoids research applied to oncology, with special attention to PDTOs and their translational potential, especially for anti-cancer drug testing, including off-label molecules.","Vivarelli, Silvia; Candido, Saverio; Caruso, Giuseppe; Falzone, Luca; Libra, Massimo",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33291603/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12123636,282

Immediate impacts of the intervention indicate an improvement in women's dietary diversity scores by half a food group out of 10. At baseline, 44% of women were likely to have consumed inadequately diverse diets; results indicate that 6% (p‐value: 0.003, SE: 0.02) fewer sample women were likely to have consumed inadequately diverse diets. More women in treatment villages consumed pulses, nuts, eggs and Vitamin A‐rich foods daily than in control villages. In response to economic shocks related to COVID‐19, households in the treatment villages were less likely to reduce the quantity of meat and fish consumption than in control villages. The long‐term impacts of the intervention need to be continuously evaluated.","Ragasa, Catherine; Lambrecht, Isabel; Mahrt, Kristi; Zhao, Hongdi; Aung, Zin Wai; Scott, Jessica",Matern Child Nutr,https://doi.org/10.1111/mcn.13259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34409727/,282

METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard of care (SOC) treatment at hospital admission; SOC plus ivermectin 100 mcg/kg; SOC plus ivermectin 200 mcg/kg; or SOC plus ivermectin 400 mcg/kg. The primary assessed endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR tests within 7 days of the start of the dosing period. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04431466). RESULTS: A total of 32 patients were enrolled and randomized to treatment. SOC treatment together with ivermectin did not result in any serious adverse events. All patients exhibited a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load within 7 days; however, those who received ivermectin had a more consistent decrease as compared to the SOC alone group, characterized by a shorter time for obtaining two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR tests. CONCLUSIONS: Ivermectin is safe in patients with SARS-CoV-2, reducing symptomatology and the SARS-CoV-2 viral load. This antiviral effect appears to depend on the dose used, and if confirmed in future studies, it suggests that ivermectin may be a useful adjuvant to the SOC treatment in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.","Pott-Junior, Henrique; Bastos Paoliello, Mônica Maria; Miguel, Alice de Queiroz Constantino; da Cunha, Anderson Ferreira; de Melo Freire, Caio Cesar; Neves, Fábio Fernandes; da Silva de Avó, Lucimar Retto; Roscani, Meliza Goi; dos Santos, Sigrid De Sousa; Chachá, Silvana Gama Florêncio",Toxicol Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750021000445?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.03.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214750021000445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723507/,282
