433,433,433,Predictive Power of Air Travel and Socio-Economic Data for Early Pandemic Spread,16.246567,3.422937,2010-09-15,"BACKGROUND: Controlling the pandemic spread of newly emerging diseases requires rapid, targeted allocation of limited resources among nations. Critical, early control steps would be greatly enhanced if the key risk factors can be identified that accurately predict early disease spread immediately after emergence. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we examine the role of travel, trade, and national healthcare resources in predicting the emergence and initial spread of 2009 A/H1N1 influenza. We find that incorporating national healthcare resource data into our analyses allowed a much greater capacity to predict the international spread of this virus. In countries with lower healthcare resources, the reporting of 2009 A/H1N1 cases was significantly delayed, likely reflecting a lower capacity for testing and reporting, as well as other socio-political issues. We also report substantial international trade in live swine and poultry in the decade preceding the pandemic which may have contributed to the emergence and mixed genotype of this pandemic strain. However, the lack of knowledge of recent evolution of each H1N1 viral gene segment precludes the use of this approach to determine viral origins. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that strategies to prevent pandemic influenza virus emergence and spread in the future should include: 1) enhanced surveillance for strains resulting from reassortment in traded livestock; 2) rapid deployment of control measures in the initial spreading phase to countries where travel data predict the pathogen will reach and to countries where lower healthcare resources will likely cause delays in reporting. Our results highlight the benefits, for all parties, when higher income countries provide additional healthcare resources for lower income countries, particularly those that have high air traffic volumes. In particular, international authorities should prioritize aid to those poorest countries where both the risk of emerging infectious diseases and air traffic volume is highest. This strategy will result in earlier detection of pathogens and a reduction in the impact of future pandemics.","Hosseini, Parviez; Sokolow, Susanne H.; Vandegrift, Kurt J.; Kilpatrick, A.

13544,13544,13544,In This Issue: December 2020,16.474047,3.3836026,2020-10-30,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of oral tranexamic acid (TXA) remain controversial because of the small number of clinical studies. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy and safety of oral TXA with intravenous TXA in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty in a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving oral and intravenous TXA in total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty up to December 2019 by searching databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Library China Biology Medicine, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Journal Database and Wanfang. The mean difference or standard mean difference was used to assess continuous outcomes such as hemoglobin (Hb) drop, total blood loss, drain blood loss, and length of hospital stay, with a 95% confidence interval. Relative risks with a 95% confidence interval were used to assess dichotomous outcomes such as transfusion rate and the incidence of deep venous thrombosis and calf muscular vein thrombosis. Review Manager was used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Ten RCTs containing 1080 participants met the inclusion criteria. We found no significant differences in terms of the average Hb drop (P = .60), total blood loss (P = .60), transfusion rate (P = .99), drain blood loss (P = .91), length of hospital stay (P = .95), and the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (P = .55) and calf muscular vein thrombosis (P = .19) between oral and IV TXA. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the IV TXA, oral TXA has similar effects on reducing the Hb drop, total blood loss, transfusion rate, drain blood loss, and length of hospital stay without increasing the risk of calf muscular vein thrombosis and deep venous thrombosis. Furthermore, oral TXA is easy to access and administer, which decreases the workload of nurses and even delivers cost-saving benefits to the health care system. We thus conclude that oral TXA may be an optimal approach in total joint arthroplasty. However, more high-quality and multicenter RCTs are still needed to confirm our conclusions. REGISTRATION: The current meta-analysis was registered on PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews), and the registration number was CRD42018111291.","Sun, Changjiao; Zhang, Xiaofei; Chen, Lianxu; Deng, Jiuzheng; Ma, Qi; Cai, Xu; Yang, Huadong",Medicine (Baltimore),183,1

AIM: The aim of this study was to describe blood transfusion practice and explore doctors’ attitudes towards transfusion. SETTING: A hospital providing level 1 and 2 services. METHODS: A mixed-methods study design was used. In the cross-sectional descriptive component, a sample was taken from patients transfused over a 2-month period. Blood use was categorised as for medical anaemia or haemorrhage, and appropriate or not. The qualitative component comprised a purposeful sample for focus group and individual semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: Of 239 patients sampled, 62% were transfused for medical anaemia and 38% for haemorrhage. In the medical anaemia group, compliance with age-appropriate transfusion thresholds was 69%. In medical anaemia and haemorrhage, 114 (77%) and 85 (93.4%) of recipients had orders for ≥ 2 red blood cell (RBC) units, respectively. In adults ≥ 18 years old with medical anaemia, 47.1% of orders would have resulted in a haemoglobin (Hb) > 8 g/dL. Six doctors participated in focus group and eleven in individual interviews. There was a lack of awareness of institutional transfusion guidelines, disagreement on appropriate RBC transfusion thresholds and comments that more than one RBC unit should always be transfused. Factors informing decisions to transfuse included advice from senior colleagues, relieving symptoms of anaemia and high product costs. CONCLUSION: Most orders were for two or more units. In medical anaemia, doctors’ compliance with RBC transfusion thresholds was reasonable; however, almost half of the orders would have resulted in overtransfusion. The attitudes of doctors sampled suggest that their transfusion practice is influenced more by institutional values than formal guidelines.","Adedayo, Temitope; O’Mahony, Don; Adeleke, Olukayode; Mabunda, Sikhumbuzo",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,183,22

Pigs and wild boar constitute the primary Hepatitis E virus (HEV) zoonotic reservoir. Consumption of undercooked animal meat or direct contact with infected animals is the most common source of HEV infection in European countries. The purpose of this study is to develop an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the detection of anti-hepatitis E virus IgG in pig serum, using plant-produced recombinant HEV-3 ORF2 as an antigenic coating protein, and also to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of this assay. A recombinant HEV-3 ORF2 110-610_6his capsid protein, transiently expressed by pEff vector in Nicotiana benthamiana plants was used to develop an in-house HEV EIA. The plant-derived HEV-3 ORF2 110-610_6his protein proved to be antigenically similar to the HEV ORF2 capsid protein and it can self-assemble into heterogeneous particulate structures. The optimal conditions for the in-house EIA (iEIA) were determined as follows: HEV-3 ORF2 110-610_6his antigen concentration (4 µg/mL), serum dilution (1:50), 3% BSA as a blocking agent, and secondary antibody dilution (1:20 000). The iEIA developed for this study showed a sensitivity of 97.1% (95% Cl: 89.9–99.65) and a specificity of 98.6% (95% Cl: 92.5–99.96) with a Youden index of 0.9571. A comparison between our iEIA and a commercial assay (PrioCHECK™ Porcine HEV Ab ELISA Kit, ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA) showed 97.8% agreement with a kappa index of 0.9399. The plant-based HEV-3 ORF2 iEIA assay was able to detect anti-HEV IgG in pig serum with a very good agreement compared to the commercially available kit.","Takova, Katerina; Koynarski, Tsvetoslav; Minkov, George; Toneva, Valentina; Mardanova, Eugenia; Ravin, Nikolai; Lukov, Georgi L.; Zahmanova, Gergana",Vaccines (Basel),183,1

The outbreak is declared as pandemic and public health emergency of international concern declared by WHO. SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the present health emergency exhibited close resemblance with SARS-CoV. Both the viruses are zoonotic and belong to a large family of viruses Coronaviridae. The complete virus particle is made up of four major structural proteins, namely spikes (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) encoded by virus genome. The S protein of virus shows similarity to S protein of SARS-CoV. COVID-19 spreads from person to person, and this makes it more vulnerable for causing infection. Several efforts are taken to find prevention strategies for COVID-19. Researchers across the globe are working to find effective vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. There is no vaccine or medication available till date for COVID-19. Preventive measures such as social distancing, awareness, maintenance of hygiene, isolation, and movement restrictions can help in control of COVID-19 spread. Proper sanitization and cleaned and sanitized public transport can be effective in inhibiting the spread of the virus.

With the rise of social media over the years, there has been a strong preference for users to be informed using their social media account, leading to a proliferation of fake news through them. This paper evaluates the veracity of politically-oriented news and in particular the tweets about the recent event of Hong Kong protests, with the aid of a dataset recently published by Twitter. From this dataset, Chinese tweets are translated into English, which are kept along with originally English tweets. By utilizing a language-independent filtering process, relevant tweets are identified. To complete the dataset, tweets originating from valid sources are used as the real portion, with journalists rather than news agencies being considered, which constitutes a novel aspect of the methodology. Well-known Machine Learning algorithms are used to classify tweets, which are represented by a feature value vector that is extracted, selected and preprocessed from the datasets and mainly revolves around language use, with word entropy being a novel feature. The results derived from these algorithms highlight morphological, lexical and vocabulary differences between tweets spreading fake and real news, which are for the most part in accordance with past related work.","Zervopoulos, Alexandros; Alvanou, Aikaterini Georgia; Bezas, Konstantinos; Papamichail, Asterios; Maragoudakis, Manolis; Kermanidis, Katia",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,183,16

One way to solve this issue is to adopt a decomposition scheme, splitting the initial difficult problem in many simpler problems. The predictions obtained from these simplified settings must then be combined into one single output, possibly resolving inconsistencies between the outputs. In this paper, we consider such an approach for the label ranking problem, where in addition we allow the predictive model to produce cautious inferences in the form of sets of rankings when it lacks information to produce reliable, precise predictions. More specifically, we propose to combine a rank-wise decomposition, in which every sub-problem becomes an ordinal classification one, with a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) approach to verify the consistency of the predictions. Our experimental results indicate that our approach produces predictions with appropriately balanced reliability and precision, while remaining competitive with classical, precise approaches.","Carranza-Alarcon, Yonatan-Carlos; Messoudi, Soundouss; Destercke, Sébastien",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,183,16

Yet, only a few mathematical models consider the coupled dynamics of the disease propagation and the contact adaptation process. This paper presents a model where each agent has a default contact neighborhood set, and switches to a different contact set once she becomes alert about infection among her default contacts. Since each agent can adopt either of two possible neighborhood sets, the overall contact network switches among [Formula: see text] possible configurations. Notably, a two-layer network representation can fully model the underlying adaptive, state-dependent contact network. Contact adaptation influences the size of the disease prevalence and the epidemic threshold—a characteristic measure of a contact network robustness against epidemics—in a nonlinear fashion. Particularly, the epidemic threshold for the presented adaptive contact network belongs to the solution of a nonlinear Perron-Frobenius (NPF) problem, which does not depend on the contact adaptation rate monotonically. Furthermore, the network adaptation model predicts a counter-intuitive scenario where adaptively changing contacts may adversely lead to lower network robustness against epidemic spreading if the contact adaptation is not fast enough.

This indicates environmental contamination with T. gondii. METHODS: Here, we established a bead-based multiplex assay (BBMA) using the Luminex technology for the detection of T. gondii infections in chickens. Recombinant biotinylated T. gondii surface antigen 1 (TgSAG1(bio)) bound to streptavidin-conjugated magnetic Luminex beads served as antigen. Serum antibodies were detected by a fluorophore-coupled secondary antibody. Beads of differing color codes were conjugated with anti-chicken IgY or chicken serum albumin and served for each sample as an internal positive or negative control, respectively. The assay was validated with sera from experimentally and naturally infected chickens. The results were compared to those from reference methods, including other serological tests, PCRs and bioassay in mice. RESULTS: In experimentally infected chickens, the vast majority (98.5%, n = 65/66) of birds tested seropositive in the BBMA. This included all chickens positive by magnetic-capture PCR (100%, n = 45/45). Most, but not all inoculated and TgSAG1(bio)-BBMA-positive chickens were also positive in two previously established TgSAG1-ELISAs (TgSAG1-ELISA(SL), n = 61/65; or TgSAG1-ELISA(SH), n = 60/65), or positive in an immunofluorescence assay (IFAT, n = 64/65) and in a modified agglutination test (MAT, n = 61/65). All non-inoculated control animals (n = 28/28, 100%) tested negative. In naturally exposed chickens, the TgSAG1(bio)-BBMA showed a high sensitivity (98.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI: 90.7–99.9%) and specificity (100%; 95% CI: 85.0–100%) relative to a reference standard established using ELISA, IFAT and MAT. Almost all naturally exposed chickens that were positive in bioassay or by PCR tested positive in the TgSAG1(bio)-BBMA (93.5%; 95% CI: 77.1–98.9%), while all bioassay- or PCR-negative chickens remained negative (100%; 95% CI: 85.0–100%). CONCLUSIONS: The TgSAG1(bio)-BBMA represents a suitable method for the detection of T. gondii infections in chickens with high sensitivity and specificity, which is comparable or even superior to other tests. Since assays based on this methodology allow for the simultaneous analysis of a single biological sample with respect to multiple analytes, the described assay may represent a component in future multiplex assays for broad serological monitoring of poultry and other farm animals for various pathogens.

While this typology and terminology can be critiqued, it is rather clear that the virus and White supremacy are key concerns of social movements in various parts of the world, particularly in nation states that experienced European colonisation and imperialism. The wake of Covid-19 has perhaps brought greater attention and support to #BlackLivesMatter-oriented protest movements, including by those labelled people of colour (POC) or ‘minorities’ in the North American context, such as Latinx and Asian communities. But with the amplified protest movement have come deeper calls for systemic change, from policy to ideology to everyday practice. Some of these critiques have been directed at the privilege, positionality, and participation of Asian communities not only with #BLM-oriented activism, but also in education and general society. This paper seeks to contribute to this critical discourse through a brief discussion of historical solidarity between Black and Asian activists and social movements, and how these practices might help inform activism within North America as well as other protest movements. Going beyond one-dimensional ‘but we experience racism too’ discourse of Asian communities that has recently increased due to anti-Asian hate crimes and scapegoating regarding ‘The Chinese Flu’, this paper explores some of the ways that historical Black-Asian solidarity can inform more intersectional and transnational analyses and pedagogies of Asian students, educators, and activists.","Chang, Benjamin ‘Benji’",Postdigit Sci Educ,183,1

RECENT FINDINGS: For specific purposes, machine learning algorithms could be exploited when data sets and appropriate algorithms are available. SUMMARY: Together with linguistic aspects, physical aspects play an important role in HRI and make the difference with respect to the more limited human-computer interaction (HCI). A review of the recent literature about the exploitation of different interaction channels is presented. The interpretation of signals and the production of appropriate communication actions require to consider psychological, sociological, and practical aspects, which may affect the performance. Communication is just one of the functionalities of an interactive robot and, as all the others, will need to be benchmarked to support the possibility for social robots to reach a real market.","Bonarini, Andrea",Curr Robot Rep,183,16

This study aimed to assess the accuracy of image registration of optical scans to 3D CBCT reconstructions created by different thresholds of grey values of segmentation in partial edentulous jaw conditions. CBCT of a dentate jaw was reconstructed to 3D mesh models using three different thresholds of gray value (−500, 500, and 1500), and three partially edentulous models with different numbers of remaining teeth (4, 8, and 12) were made from each 3D reconstruction model. To merge CBCT and optical scan data, optical scan images were registered to respective 3D reconstruction CBCT images using a point-based best-fit algorithm. The accuracy of image registration was assessed by measuring the positional deviation between the matched 3D images. The Kruskal–Wallis test and a post hoc Mann–Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction were used to compare the results between groups (α = 0.05). The correlations between the experimental factors were calculated using the two-way analysis of variance test. The positional deviations were lowest with the threshold of 500, followed by the threshold of 1500, and then −500. A significant interaction was found between the threshold of gray values and the number of remaining teeth on the registration accuracy. The most significant deviation was observed in the arch model with four teeth reconstructed with a gray-value threshold of −500. The threshold for the gray value of CBCT segmentation affects the accuracy of image registration of optical scans to the 3D reconstruction model of CBCT. The appropriate gray value that can visualize the anatomical structure should be set, especially when few teeth remain in the dental arch.","Park, Se-Won; Yoon, Ra Gyoung; Lee, Hyunwoo; Lee, Heon-Jin; Choi, Yong-Do; Lee, Du-Hyeong",Int J Environ Res Public Health,183,1

Although restrictions were generally considered necessary to save lives and protect health care systems from overburdening, they also pose the risk of government overreach, that is, governments may use the pandemic as a convenient opportunity and justification to impose restrictions for political purposes. In this sense, COVID-19 may give yet another substantial boost to a global trend that has been unfolding since the early 2000s: the shrinking of civic spaces, which is characterized by an increase in government restrictions that target civil society actors and limit their freedoms of assembly, association, and expression. The aim of the paper is to assess civic space restrictions that have been imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a view to exploring their immediate consequences as well as their potential mid-term implications for civil society organizations in general and contentious civic activism in particular. We do so by, first, providing evidence from multiple data sources about the global spread of COVID-19-related restrictions over time and across countries. Second, we identify key dynamics at work in order to assess the immediate consequences and the potential mid-term implications of these restrictions. These dynamics are illustrated by looking at experiences from individual countries (including Cambodia, Germany, Hungary, and Lebanon).

The integration of digital innovations enables healthcare institutions to transform their current activities and processes and to create a new form of patient care. IMPORTANT ECONOMIC TOPICS OF DIGITALIZATION: Using digital applications process optimization can be achieved by increased efficiency and therefore a reduction in costs in the healthcare system. Improved processes can in turn achieve an increase in quality in the treatment of patients. Simultaneously, a duplication of investigations can be avoided through digital interfaces and the communication among the healthcare professions involved can be improved, which would result in a conservation of resources. Finally, these influences can lead to more precision in medicine, acceleration of healing processes and represent an advantage for all parties involved. PERSPECTIVES: Economic redistribution due to digitalization of medicine will become increasingly apparent in the future. Ethical considerations as well as data protection will be important topics. At the same time investments and digital innovations must be sponsored by the government and industry. Scientific studies are necessary to secure the evidence of new methods for practice in orthopedics and trauma surgery.","Pförringer, Dominik; Matusiewicz, David; Tsitsilonis, Serafeim; Gehlen, Tobias; Back, David A.",Unfallchirurg,183,1

CQROULS contains uncertain linguistic variables, truth and falsity grades, which gives extensive freedom to decision makers for taking a decision as compared to CQROFS and their special cases. In this article, a new concept of fuzzy set, called CQROULS using CQROFS and ULVS is explored, and this can examine the qualitative assessment of decision makers and gives them extensive freedom in reflecting their belief about allowable truth grades. Based on the established operational laws and comparison methods for CQROULSs, the notions of complex q-rung orthopair uncertain linguistic weighted-averaging aggregation operator and complex q-rung orthopair uncertain linguistic weighted geometric aggregation operator are explored. Some special cases and the desirable properties of the explored operators are also established and studied.

We aimed to explore the value of these parameters in the early identification of influenza virus infection in children. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective, observational study of fever with influenza-like symptoms in pediatric outpatients from different age groups and evaluated the predictive value of various routine blood parameters measured within 48 h of the onset of fever for influenza virus infection. RESULTS: The LYM count, PLT count, LMR and LYM*PLT were lower, and the NLR and MPV/PLT were higher in children with an influenza infection (PCR-confirmed and symptomatic). The LYM count, LMR and LYM*PLT in the influenza infection group were lower in the 1- to 6-year-old subgroup, and the LMR and LYM*PLT in the influenza infection group were lower in the > 6-year-old subgroup. In the 1- to 6-year-old subgroup, the cutoff value of the LMR for predicting influenza A virus infection was 3.75, the sensitivity was 81.87%, the specificity was 84.31%, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.886; the cutoff value of the LMR for predicting influenza B virus infection was 3.71, the sensitivity was 73.58%, the specificity was 84.31%, and the AUC was 0.843. In the > 6-year-old subgroup, the cutoff value of the LMR for predicting influenza A virus infection was 3.05, the sensitivity was 89.27%, the specificity was 89.61%, and the AUC was 0.949; the cutoff value of the LMR for predicting influenza B virus infection was 2.88, the sensitivity was 83.19%, the specificity was 92.21%, and the AUC was 0.924. CONCLUSIONS: Routine blood tests are simple, inexpensive and easy to perform, and they are useful for the early identification of influenza virus infection in children. The LMR had the strongest predictive value for influenza virus infection in children older than 1 year, particularly in children older than 6 years with influenza A virus infection.","Zhu, Ronghe; Chen, Cuie; Wang, Qiu; Zhang, Xixi; Lu, Chaosheng; Sun, Yuanyuan",BMC Infect Dis,183,1

[2018] proposed a linear type system [Formula: see text] as a core type system of Linear Haskell. In the system, linearity is represented by annotated arrow types [Formula: see text] , where m denotes the multiplicity of the argument. Thanks to this representation, existing non-linear code typechecks as it is, and newly written linear code can be used with existing non-linear code in many cases. However, little is known about the type inference of [Formula: see text] . Although the Linear Haskell implementation is equipped with type inference, its algorithm has not been formalized, and the implementation often fails to infer principal types, especially for higher-order functions. In this paper, based on OutsideIn(X) [Vytiniotis et al., 2011], we propose an inference system for a rank 1 qualified-typed variant of [Formula: see text] , which infers principal types. A technical challenge in this new setting is to deal with ambiguous types inferred by naive qualified typing. We address this ambiguity issue through quantifier elimination and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with examples.","Matsuda, Kazutaka",Programming Languages and Systems,183,16

The most widely-used framework for interprocedural data-flow analysis is IFDS, which encompasses distributive data-flow functions over a finite domain. On-demand data-flow analyses restrict the focus of the analysis on specific program locations and data facts. This setting provides a natural split between (i) an offline (or preprocessing) phase, where the program is partially analyzed and analysis summaries are created, and (ii) an online (or query) phase, where analysis queries arrive on demand and the summaries are used to speed up answering queries. In this work, we consider on-demand IFDS analyses where the queries concern program locations of the same procedure (aka same-context queries). We exploit the fact that flow graphs of programs have low treewidth to develop faster algorithms that are space and time optimal for many common data-flow analyses, in both the preprocessing and the query phase. We also use treewidth to develop query solutions that are embarrassingly parallelizable, i.e. the total work for answering each query is split to a number of threads such that each thread performs only a constant amount of work. Finally, we implement a static analyzer based on our algorithms, and perform a series of on-demand analysis experiments on standard benchmarks. Our experimental results show a drastic speed-up of the queries after only a lightweight preprocessing phase, which significantly outperforms existing techniques.","Chatterjee, Krishnendu; Goharshady, Amir Kafshdar; Ibsen-Jensen, Rasmus; Pavlogiannis, Andreas",Programming Languages and Systems,183,16

While everyone is affected in some way by the pandemic, older persons have been far more likely to suffer the most severe health consequences. For this reason, how people have responded to the COVID-19 outbreak may differ by age. Using a nationally representative sample from the Understanding America Study (UAS), we examined differentials in behavioral responses to COVID-19 by age and how they change over time. At the beginning of the pandemic (March, 2020), older people were less likely than younger ones to engage in preventive behaviors. As the pandemic progressed, however, older people have adopted healthy behavioral changes more than younger people, such that about two months after the pandemic started, older people were more likely to comply with suggested and regulated behaviors including practicing better hygiene, quarantining, and social distancing. Even when considering other potential influences on behavioral responses, older age was significantly related to performing more preventive behaviors, and gender, racial/ethnic minority status, perceived risk for infection and dying and political orientation were also found to be related to people’s behavioral responses.","Kim, Jung Ki; Crimmins, Eileen",Innov Aging,183,1

We asked whether older adults would retain this positive focus even during the COVID-19 pandemic that puts older adults at particular health risk. We examined how age would relate to the experience of affect during the spring phase of the pandemic and also how it would affect their memories of that spring phase. We predicted that when reflecting on the spring phase of the pandemic, older age would be associated with an increased tendency to focus on “silver linings” and a decreased focus on negative aspects. Furthermore, we explored whether focusing on those “silver linings” would be driven by (i) more positive experienced affect during the spring-phase, or (ii) by a memory-specific effect that would persist after controlling for experienced affect. As predicted, older age was associated with increased focus on “silver linings” such as feelings of hope that the measures would reduce disease spread (p <.001) or memories of the community coming together (p <.001). These effects remained even when controlling for older adults’ more-positive affect during the spring phase of the pandemic (community coming together, p=.03, and feeling hope, p=.008). These results suggest that older adults remain resilient during the ongoing pandemic. Compared to younger adults, older adults experience greater affective well-being in the moment and also benefit from a memory-specific mechanism allowing them to view the ongoing negative event through a rosier lens.","Garcia, Sandry; Ford, Jaclyn; Fields, Eric; Cunningham, Tony; Kensinger, Elizabeth",Innov Aging,183,22

This academically designed and run three-way crossover trial aims to test a stratification approach using three standard oral glucose-lowering agents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: TriMaster is a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial taking place at up to 25 clinical sites across England, Scotland and Wales. 520 patients with T2DM treated with either metformin alone, or metformin and a sulfonylurea who have glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) >58 mmol/mol will be randomised to receive 16 weeks each of a dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitor, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor and thiazolidinedione in random order. Participants will be assessed at the end of each treatment period, providing clinical and biochemical data, and their experience of side effects. Participant preference will be assessed on completion of all three treatments. The primary endpoint is HbA(1c) after 4 months of therapy (allowing a range of 12–18 weeks for analysis).

Generally, the immune response of the human body triggered by viral infection is essential for the elimination of the virus. However, severe COVID-19 patients may manifest dysregulated immune responses, such as lymphopenia, lymphocyte exhaustion, exacerbated antibody response, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), etc. Understanding of these immunological characteristics may help identify better approaches for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients.

This article investigates whether citizens are more willing to comply with strict policy recommendations about a public health issue when those recommendations are made by a female leader rather than a male leader. Using a survey experiment with American citizens, we compare individuals’ willingness to comply with policy along three dimensions: social distancing, face covering, and contact tracing. Our findings show that a leader's gender has little impact on policy compliance in general during the pandemic.

Depending on the conveyed bulk material, these chute systems often cause wear, caking, and poor material handling. Wear occurs both on the chute walls and on the downstream conveyor belt. Caking on the chute walls is oftencaused by the cohesive fine-grained particles of the bulk material. Especially wet bulk material can lead to clogging of the chutes. Bulk material handling is ideal when the bulk material is loaded centrally onto the downstream conveyor. Furthermore, feeding in conveying direction of the downstream belt conveyor and a material deflection by the chute with minimum wear are also required for ideal bulk material handling. At the “Chair of Mining Engineering and Mineral Economics—Conveying Technology and Design Methods” in cooperation with the companies ScrapeTec Trading GmbH, ScrapeTec GmbH and WanggoGummitechnik GmbH, a new dynamic transfer chute is currently being developed, since standard chute systems are often unable to optimally perform the tasks assigned to them.","Prenner, Michael",Berg Huttenmannische Monatshefte,183,1

Contexts and practices that aim to be “trauma-informed” strive to attend to the complex impacts of trauma, integrating knowledge into policies and practices, and providing a sanctuary from harm. However, there is a body of critical and decolonial scholarship that challenges the ways in which “trauma-informed” practice prioritizes individualized interventions, reinscribes colonial power relations through its conceptualizations of safety, and obscures the role of systemic injustices. Within music therapy trauma scholarship, research has thus far pointed to the affordances of music in ameliorating symptoms of trauma, bypassing unavailable cognitive processes, and working from a strengths-based orientation. In critiquing the tendency of the dominant trauma paradigm to assign vulnerability and reinforce the individual’s responsibility to develop resilience through adversity, this conceptual analysis outlines potential alternatives within music therapy. Drawing on a case example from a research project with young people in school, I elucidate the ways in which music therapy can respond to power relations as they occur within and beyond “trauma-informed” spaces. I highlight two overarching potentials for music therapy within a shifting trauma paradigm: (1) as a site in which to reframe perceived risk by fostering young people’s resistance and building their political agency and (2) in challenging the assumption of “safe spaces” and instead moving toward practices of “structuring safety.”","Scrine, Elly",Front Psychol,183,1

But, some recent H5Nx subtype viruses could cause high mortality in ducks. The variation between different species and the mechanisms by which some H5Nx viruses cause death in ducks requires investigation to identify the key processes in influenza susceptibility and pathogenesis. Here, we characterized two representative H5N6 viruses, A/Pavo cristatus/Jiangxi/JA1/2016 (JA1) and A/Anas crecca/shanghai/SH1/2016 (SH1), and compared their pathogenicity and expression profiles of immune-related genes in chickens and ducks to identify the elements of the host immune-related response that were involved in disease lethality. Results suggested that H5N6 HPAIVs had higher pathogenic and inflammatory effect in chickens than in ducks. Importantly, the TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ and iNOS levels were significantly higher in the lung of SH1 infected chickens compared to those of ducks. And we found higher systemic levels of IL-6 induced by JA1 in chickens than in ducks. In addition, our experiments demonstrated that JA1 was associated with greater pathogenicity in ducks were accompanied by the excessive expression of iNOS in the brain. These results are helpful to understand the relationship between the pathogenicity of H5N6 AIVs and inflammatory responses to them in chickens and ducks.","Wang, Bo; Su, Qianqian; Luo, Jing; Li, Meng; Wu, Qiaoxing; Chang, Han; Du, Juan; Huang, Chengmei; Ma, Jiajun; Han, Shuyi; Yuan, Guohui; He, Yapeng; Guo, Minglei; Zhang, Qingxun; He, Hongxuan",Front Microbiol,183,16

Here, we summarize our efforts to optimize culture conditions for improved growth and functional differentiation of mouse and human colon organoids. METHODS: Mouse and human colon organoids were grown in four different media. Media-dependent long-term growth was measured by quantifying surviving organoids via imaging and a cell viability readout over five passages. The impact of diverse media on differentiation was assessed by quantifying the number of epithelial cell types using markers for enterocytes, stem cells, Goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells by qPCR and histology upon removal of growth factors. RESULTS: In contrast to Wnt3a-conditioned media, media supplemented with recombinant Wnt3a alone did not support long-term survival of human or mouse colon organoids. Mechanistically, this observation can be attributed to the fact that recombinant Wnt3a did not support stem cell survival or proliferation as demonstrated by decreased LGR5 and Ki67 expression. When monitoring expression of markers for epithelial cell types, the highest level of organoid differentiation was observed after combined removal of Wnt3a, Noggin, and R-spondin from Wnta3a-conditioned media cultures. CONCLUSION: Our study defined Wnt3a-containing conditioned media as optimal for growth and survival of human and mouse organoids. Furthermore, we established that the combined removal of Wnt3a, Noggin, and R-spondin results in optimal differentiation. This study provides a step forward in optimizing conditions for intestinal organoid growth to improve standardization and reproducibility of this model platform.","Wilson, Sarah S.; Mayo, Martha; Melim, Terry; Knight, Heather; Patnaude, Lori; Wu, Xiaoming; Phillips, Lucy; Westmoreland, Susan; Dunstan, Robert; Fiebiger, Edda; Terrillon, Sonia",Front Immunol,183,16

Recent surges in nationalist, fundamentalist, protectionist, and separatist tendencies highlight the imperative for music education to extend beyond nominal policy agendas to critically consider the ways in which understandings about society are upheld or unsettled and the ways in which knowledge about diversity is produced. This chapter provides an overview of the scholarly foundations that this book builds upon before introducing the four sections of the book and contributing chapters. The first section of the book focuses on the politics of inquiry in music education research. The second section attends to the paradoxes and challenges that arise as music teachers negotiate cultural identity and tradition within the political frames and ideals of the nation state. The third section considers diversities that are often overlooked or silenced, and the final section turns to matters of leadership in higher music education as an inherently political and ethical undertaking. Together, chapters work towards a more critical, complex, and nuanced understanding of the ways in which the politics of diversity shape our ideals of what music education is, and what it is for.","Kallio, Alexis Anja; Marsh, Kathryn; Westerlund, Heidi; Karlsen, Sidsel; Sæther, Eva",The Politics of Diversity in Music Education,183,1

Then, having in mind our previous analysis, we try to provide an answer as to whether the Achaean state was a federation or a confederacy. Further, we analyse the influence of the Achaean federal state on the American Founding Fathers when formulating the US Constitution of 1787. Finally, we provide a comparison between the Achaean federal state and the European Union under a specific set of institutional intertemporal criteria. We argue that the Achaean federal paradigm, the institutions and the policies that were practised by the ancient Achaeans on a variety of issues (economic and social policy, foreign affairs, peace and warfare etc.), could serve as a source of inspiration for the further political and economic integration of the European Union today.","Economou, Emmanouil M.

However, OAHR continues to face several challenges, including high variability of the Arabic script and its intrinsic characteristics such as cursiveness, ligatures, and diacritics, the unlimited variation in human handwriting, and the lack of large public databases. In this paper, we introduce a novel context-aware model based on deep neural networks to address the challenges of recognizing offline handwritten Arabic text, including isolated digits, characters, and words. Specifically, we propose a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that contextually extracts optimal features and employs batch normalization and dropout regularization parameters. This aims to prevent overfitting and further enhance generalization performance when compared to conventional deep learning models. We employ a number of deep stacked-convolutional layers to design the proposed Deep CNN (DCNN) architecture. The model is extensively evaluated and shown to demonstrate excellent classification accuracy when compared to conventional OAHR approaches on a diverse set of six benchmark databases, including MADBase (Digits), CMATERDB (Digits), HACDB (Characters), SUST-ALT (Digits), SUST-ALT (Characters), and SUST-ALT (Names). A further experimental study is conducted on the benchmark Arabic databases by exploiting transfer learning (TL)-based feature extraction which demonstrates the superiority of our proposed model in relation to state-of-the-art VGGNet-19 and MobileNet pre-trained models. Finally, experiments are conducted to assess comparative generalization capabilities of the models using another language database , specifically the benchmark MNIST English isolated Digits database, which further confirm the superiority of our proposed DCNN model.","Ahmed, Rami; Gogate, Mandar; Tahir, Ahsen; Dashtipour, Kia; Al-tamimi, Bassam; Hawalah, Ahmad; El-Affendi, Mohammed A.; Hussain, Amir",Entropy (Basel),183,1

In mid-March 2020 the Division of Digestive Care and Endoscopy at Dalhousie University leveraged eHealth technology to rapidly implemented a new referral management and triage system and established a new rapid outpatient consultation service to facilitate urgent virtual and face-to-face appointments. Standardized procedures for triaging, booking, and staffing the urgent gastroenterology consultation service were implemented. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the implementation of a standardized triage and consultation process on access to urgent gastroenterology consultative services at a single tertiary care center during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a pre- and post-implementation study comparing efficiency metrics for urgent triage and urgent consultation. The pre-implementation cohort included all patients referred and triaged to an urgent clinic appointment between April 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019. The post-implementation cohort included all patients referred and triaged to an urgent clinic appointment between April 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020. Healthcare efficiency data was extracted through electronic record review with specific dates and times for referral receipt (a), triage completion (b), appointment wait-listing (c), and clinic appointment (d). The time to triage (TT), time to visit (TV), and total time to consult (TC) were calculated (TT = c - a; TV = d - c; TC = TT + TV) for each patient. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare TT, TV, CT between patient cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 429 patients were booked for urgent clinic consultation, 176 during the pre-implementation period and 253 in the post-implementation period. The mean TT for the pre-and post-implementation cohorts was 4.8 days and 3.3 days, respectively (U=18,149, p=0.001). Mean TV was decreased from 16.2 days for the pre-implementation cohort to 3.6 days for the post-implementation cohort (U=6095, p=0.000). The mean time from a referral being received to the patient being seen in consultation (TC) decreased by 67% from 21 days to 6.9 days, Figure 1 (U=6,419, p=0.000). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on healthcare delivery in Nova Scotia. One positive result is that it facilitated the motivation and alignment needed to make a large health system change that may not have otherwise been possible. This study demonstrates that a standardized pathway for urgent outpatient gastroenterology assessment improves the timeliness of care delivery.

They present the emerging trends from the children’s narratives focusing on their experience of the lockdown in relation to family life, school life, contacts with friends, and in relation to space, time and self. During the lockdown leisure activities and hobbies, followed by life with friends and school life challenged relational well-being the most, while family life opened up new perspectives and generational solidarity. Staying at home and decreased physical activity impacted on the physical health of children, missing direct contacts with friends and teachers put social relations to test, fear of the virus decreased feeling safe and secure, and the lockdown restricted participation in society. The findings underline the relational nature of their well-being.

In the past, when on-the-job training for junior employees were conducted in the manufacturing industry, they often carried out technical training with “mentorship system” or “work manual”. This study aims at how video makes effects to those who work in manufacturing industries, especially those from other countries. Migrant workers from abroad or companies with manufacturing plants overseas have gradually used video manual as teaching materials for enterprise education and training, especially when COVID-19 becomes a global epidemic crisis. This study used in-depth interview research methods to investigate both workers and managers in the same manufacturing industry. The results found that when using digital cameras to record and edit, the production line equipment can achieve the following effects: (1) Promoting junior workers’ self-efficacy; (2) Use of different language translations can provide simultaneous education and training for workers from multiple countries; (3) Putting digital teaching materials on cloud will make employees to use digital mobile vehicles to download and learn, that can save more time for employees.","Yen, Chia Sung",Rev Socionetwork Strat,183,33

The study is supported by the INTEGRATE ENT Trainee Research Network and the Audiology NIHR Champions, as well as being adopted onto the NIHR Clinical Research Network. It aims to map the pathway of patients with SSNHL, develop a prognostic model to predict recovery of patients with idiopathic SSNHL and establish the impact on patients’ quality of life. Here we summarise the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the study and highlight methods employed to improve data collection. METHODS: Data collection commenced in October 2019 and as of August 2020, 227 patients have been recruited from 66 registered sites across England. This interim data was analysed. The primary outcome was the change in monthly patient recruitment and site registration. The secondary outcome was the completeness of the dataset. RESULTS: Initially, monthly site registration increased to a peak of 31 in December 2019 and monthly patient recruitment increased to a peak of 34 in February 2020. Both levels decreased during the first wave of Covid-19 with 11 patients recruited and 0 sites registered in April 2020. Both levels have been increasing since, with 21 patients recruited and 5 sites registered in August 2020. The dataset of 227 patients has 113 (49.7%) completed records. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the largest national cohort study into SSNHL. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, data collection continued during the first wave and rates are now recovering to pre-Covid-19 levels. Key factors in this recovery are a collaborative research approach involving motivated trainees, an ethics amendment for follow-up data to be collected by telephone and continued engagement of collaborators through regular email correspondence and fortnightly newsletters.","Joshi, Nikhil; Ahmed, Muhammad; Mandavia, Rishi; Joshi, Nikhil",BJS Open,183,1

The most serious Zika-associated inflammatory eye disease is uveitis, which is commonly anterior in type, affecting both eyes and responding to corticosteroid eye drops. Mechanisms of Zika-associated anterior uveitis are unknown, but ZIKV has been identified in the aqueous humor of affected individuals. The iris pigment epithelium is a target cell population in viral anterior uveitis, and it acts to maintain immune privilege within the anterior eye. Interactions between ZIKV and human iris pigment epithelial cells were investigated with infectivity assays and RNA-sequencing. Primary cell isolates were prepared from eyes of 20 cadaveric donors, and infected for 24 hours with PRVABC59 strain ZIKV or incubated uninfected as control. Cytoimmunofluorescence, RT-qPCR on total cellular RNA, and focus-forming assays of culture supernatant showed cell isolates were permissive to infection, and supported replication and release of infectious ZIKV. To explore molecular responses of cell isolates to ZIKV infection at the whole transcriptome level, RNA was sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform, and results were aligned to the human GRCh38 genome. Multidimensional scaling showed clear separation between transcriptomes of infected and uninfected cell isolates. Differential expression analysis indicated a vigorous molecular response of the cell to ZIKV: 7,935 genes were differentially expressed between ZIKV-infected and uninfected cells (FDR < 0.05), and 99% of 613 genes that changed at least two-fold were up-regulated. Reactome and KEGG pathway and Gene Ontology enrichment analyses indicated strong activation of viral recognition and defense, in addition to biosynthesis processes. A CHAT network included 6275 molecular nodes and 24 contextual hubs in the cell response to ZIKV infection. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1) was the most significantly connected contextual hub. Correlation of gene expression with read counts assigned to the ZIKV genome identified a negative correlation between interferon signaling and viral load across isolates. This work represents the first investigation of mechanisms of Zika-associated anterior uveitis using an in vitro human cell model. The results suggest the iris pigment epithelium mounts a molecular response that limits intraocular pathology in most individuals.","Ryan, Feargal J.; Carr, Jillian M.; Furtado, João M.; Ma, Yuefang; Ashander, Liam M.; Simões, Milena; Oliver, Genevieve F.; Granado, G.

Many scholars agree that circular economy (CE) currently displays a social gap, as most studies so far focus mostly on economic aspects and, occasionally, environmental too. Although some developed countries and especially the EU heavily promote it, there is little possibility of developing countries accepting CE unless it can fill what it is lacking. This study suggests the use of Schlosberg’s tripartite environmental justice (EJ) perspective to complete the concept of CE, bringing it closer to that of SD. Due to their significant contribution to both circularity and the environment, and, likewise, due to their poor social conditions, this paper focuses on the social group of WPs, mainly in Brazil. After conducting 19 semi-structured interviews, EJ was applied to the case of the Ecopoints in Fortaleza (northeastern Brazil) and each element—recognition, distribution, and participation—detected conflicts, such as underappreciation, continuously reduced access to recyclables, distrust, and miscommunication. If CE is successful in LMCs, it will heavily rely on WPs. The analysis suggests that it is necessary to recognize their contributions in order to value their work and consequently, promote their social inclusion.","Amorim de Oliveira, Ísis",Circ.Econ.Sust.,183,17

In addition to disrupting sleep and impairing communication, recognised patient consequences include increased pain, increased re-admission rates and post-ICU psychosis. Ambient white-noise machines, sound-absorbing ceilings and retractable screens are purported as noise pollution reducing strategies (NPRS). These are expensive and impractical. We investigated the capacity of various low resource NPRSs. Noise was measured using “Sound Meter” app at four sites on two identical surgical wards. Ward A and B were designated as study and control ward, respectively. Measurements were taken at three time points (9am, 11am, 3pm) every day during a week. NPRSs were then implemented in ward A and data collection repeated. Prior to intervention there was no difference in noise between ward A and ward B (83dB and 87dB respectively, p > 0.05). After intervention, ward A was significantly quieter than ward B (64dB and 85dB respectively, p < 0.05). Restructuring ward environments presents several challenges. However, low resource interventions can have a positive role in reducing noise pollution. As hospitals become busier with resumption of normal services post-COVID-19, staff should be considerate of noise pollution in order to create an environment conducive to high quality patient care.","Shah, S",Br J Surg,183,33

Neoclassical economic theory suggests that the deregulation (i.e. higher flexibility) of the labour market stimulates firms to hire young people and—therefore—reduces youth unemployment. The aim of this study is to empirically test the validity of this hypothesis, analysing data on youth unemployment and labour market regulation index (LMRI) for 28 European countries in the period between 2000 and 2018. The empirical results—using two different econometric techniques (time and fixed effects that allows to take into account the presence of heterogeneity of countries in the model and pooling mean group (PMG) estimator providing results about the short and long run relationship between LMRI and youth unemployment)—do not provide evidence in support of the neoclassical hypothesis. In particular, the effect of higher flexibility of the labour market is negative and statistically significant (at 1%) only when a dummy variable for the Eastern country group is included in the model. Vice-versa, the paper shows that higher economic growth and higher investment in active labour market policy represent the key variables to reduce the youth unemployment. In conclusion, the paper raises many doubts that the introduction of flexibility measures in itself can represent a useful tool to counteract the increase of youth unemployment in Europe.","Liotti, Giorgio",Ital Econ J,183,1

Our study compares state anxiety level of high school students on a regular school day and on an experimental “mobile-free day”, when participants do not carry their mobile phones during classes. We hypothesized that separation from the mobiles would increase anxiety and decrease class engagement, especially in students with higher mobile attachment scores. The sample consisted of 235 secondary school students. Results of Repeated Measures ANCOVA showed that anxiety levels increased on the mobile-free school day, but class engagement was not affected by the experiment. Linear regression analysis revealed ‘Safe Haven’ mobile attachment to be a significant predictor of state anxiety on the mobile free school day. Moreover, correlation analysis revealed that mobile use habits linked to social media and instant message services were associated with higher anxiety scores on the mobile-free school day.

The virus further exploits the host cellular machinery to gain access into the cells; its spike protein is cleaved by a host cell surface transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) shortly after binding ACE2 followed by its proteolytic activation at a furin cleavage site. The virus primarily targets the epithelium of the respiratory tract which is covered by a tightly regulated airway surface liquid (ASL) layer that serves as a primary defense mechanism against respiratory pathogens. The volume and viscosity of this fluid layer is regulated and maintained by a coordinated function of different transport pathways in the respiratory epithelium. We argue that SARS‐CoV‐2 may potentially alter evolutionary conserved second‐messenger signaling cascades via activation of G‐protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or by directly modulating G protein signaling. Such signaling may in turn adversely modulate transepithelial transport processes, especially those involving cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC), thereby shifting the delicate balance between anion secretion and sodium absorption that controls homeostasis of this fluid layer. As a result, activation of the secretory pathways including CFTR‐mediated Cl(‐) transport may overwhelm the absorptive pathways such as ENaC‐dependent Na(+) uptake and initiate a pathophysiological cascade leading to lung edema, one of the most serious and potentially deadly clinical manifestations of COVID‐19.","Abdel Hameid, Reem; Tambi, Richa; Nassir, Nasna; Begum, Ghausia; Zehra, Binte; Akter, Hosneara; Cormet‐Boyaka, Estelle; Kuebler, Wolfgang; Uddin, Mohammed; Berdiev, Bakhrom",FASEB J,183,16

We find that most countries adopted restrictions within a few days only and that restrictions on internal mobility had been introduced prior to restrictions on cross‐border mobility, but that the latter have been more persistent. Furthermore, we observe an evolution from great variation of policy choices at the outset of the pandemic towards convergence. Analyzing the mobility restrictions through a policy diffusion lens, we find tentative evidence for interdependent policy‐making especially in the temporal patterns of adoption.

These policies or interventions, however, frequently fail to recognize how the beneficiaries have historically embodied the cumulative effects of marginalization, which undermines the effectiveness of the intended justice. These well-meaning attempts at justice are bounded by greater socio-historical constraints. Bounded justice suggests that it is impossible to attend to fairness, entitlement, and equity when the basic social and physical infrastructures underlying them have been eroded by racism and other historically entrenched isms. Using the case of Brazil’s National Health Policy for the Black Population, this paper proposes that bounded justice can contribute to justice discourses by serving as a concept, a proffering to a multi-disciplinary conceptual framework, and a potential analytic for those interested in the design of policy, technology, and programmatic interventions towards health equity.","Creary, Melissa S.",,183,22

In more economically developed countries, this percentage is considerably higher. Increasingly, cities’ more vulnerable and culturally diverse neighbourhoods are the context of violent conflicts linked to interconnected socio-economic (inequality), ethnocultural (discrimination) and public-institutional (delegitimation) causal factors. Social outbursts such as London (2011) or Husby’s (Stockholm, 2013) riots are amongst the most notorious recent examples of these. Both the frequency and intensity of these conflicts are only expected to worsen as the economic impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic takes hold. This article introduces the ‘Theory of Rupture Frames (TRF)’, which offers a new three-dimensional explanatory model of violent conflicts in vulnerable neighbourhoods with high socio-cultural diversity. The ‘TRF’, it is argued, offers a novel and suitable framework for founding and guiding social work’s preventative and healing-oriented interventions facing these. This is in relation to the TRF’s dual potential for (i) contributing to the theoretical understanding in the social work profession of this type of conflict and for (ii) offering a tool for guiding the assessment of needs and strategic planning of social work-led actions in the context of the neighbourhoods affected by the conflicts or at risk of their outburst.","Barciela Fernández, Sergio; Lorenzo Gilsanz, Francisco; Martínez Herrero, María Inés",Br J Soc Work,183,1

This study uses the Fuzzy PROMETHEE technique to develop a new path for cancer treatment based on nanoparticles (NPs) applications, used in controlled anticancer drug delivery (drug release, toxicity, and unspecific site targeting) to enhance patient safety. The different nanoparticles employed in the drug delivery analysis are gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), liposomes, dendrimers, polymeric micelles (PMs), and quantum dots (QDs). Fuzzy predictable preference organization mode and evaluation multicriteria choice were used as tactics in making the best decision using the data from the factors of cost, size, shape, surface charge, ligand type, pH and temperature stimuli, biocompatibility, accumulation ratio, toxicity, specificity, stability, efficacy, adverse effect, and safety factor of the NPs. The results obtained from the total net flow of the visual PROMETHEE scenario for anticancer drug delivery, based on NPs data analysis, show that AuNPs are ranked the highest among the other NPs. The Phi values obtained for the NPs are as follows: AuNPs (0.1428), PMs (0.0280), QDs (−0.0467), dendrimers (−0.0593), and liposomes (−0.0649). This study highlights the optimal choice of NPs as an intelligent drug delivery system that facilitates therapeutic efficiency, where cancer cells are accurately targeted to enhance treatment quality and patient safety.","Albarwary, Safa Anmar; Kibarer, Ayse Gunay; Mustapha, Mubarak Taiwo; Hamdan, Hani; Ozsahin, Dilber Uzun",J Healthc Eng,183,13

Recently, biscuits’ technologies have been rapidly developed to improve their nutritional properties. This study aimed to determine the strategies of improving the nutritional quality of biscuits and the potential health benefits associated with them. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted, including articles on biscuits improved by technological processes and raw materials variation. Studies were searched from Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science published between 1997 and 2020, in English and French. The meta-analysis was performed using RStudio software, version 4.0.4 to classify the biscuits. One hundred and seven eligible articles were identified. Rice, pea, potato, sorghum, buckwheat, and flaxseed flours were respectively the most found substitutes to wheat flour. But the meta-analysis shown that the copra and foxtail millet biscuit fortified with amaranth, the wheat biscuits fortified with okra, and rice biscuits fortified with soybeans had a high protein content. These biscuits therefore have a potential to be used as complementary foods. The substitution of sugar and fat by several substitutes lead to a decrease in carbohydrates, fat, and energy value. It has also brought about an increase in other nutrients such as dietary fiber, proteins/amino acids, fatty acids, and phenolic compounds. Among the sugar and fat substitutes, stevia and inulin were respectively the most used. Regarding the use of biscuits in clinical trials, they were mainly used for addressing micronutrient deficiency and for weight loss.

ETo modelling based on a single meteorological parameter would be beneficial in places where the collection of climatic parameters is challenging. The aim of this research is to develop a deep neural network (DNN) architecture that predicts daily ETo with a single input parameter selected based on the feature importance (FI) score generated by the machine learning techniques, random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). This study also investigated the potential of SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret and validate the outcomes of the feature selection methods by assessing the contributions of each feature to the ETo prediction. These methods recommended solar radiation as a significant parameter in the datasets of three California Irrigation Management System (CIMIS) weather stations located in distinct ETo zones. Three ETo models (DNN-Ret, XGB-Ret, and RF-Ret) were built using solar radiation as the sole input, and CIMIS ETo as the output. The performance evaluation of the developed models proved that DNN-Ret outperformed XGB-Ret and RF-Ret regardless of the dataset, with coefficients of determination (R(2)) ranging from 0.914 to 0.954 in the local scenario, with an average decrease of 8–9.5% in mean absolute error and root mean squared error, and an improvement of 2.6–2.9% in Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and 1.7–2% increase in R(2). The overall result analysis highlighted the efficiency of DNN-Ret in the single input parameter based ETo modelling in diverse climatic zones.","Ravindran, Sowmya Mangalath; Bhaskaran, Santosh Kumar Moorakkal; Ambat, Sooraj Krishnan Nair",Environ,183,1

To the best of our knowledge, no appropriate surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 has been identified or confirmed for chlorine and antimicrobial surface disinfection. We completed a study to evaluate the efficacy of two hypothesized antimicrobial surfaces, and four chlorine solutions on nonporous and porous surfaces, against SARS-CoV-2 and three potential SARS-CoV-2 surrogates [coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and bacteriophages Phi6 and MS2], to identify a BSL-1 or BSL-2 virus to use in future studies. We found SARS-CoV-2 can be reduced >4 log(10) on porous and nonporous surfaces within 30 s upon exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. The results indicate coronavirus MHV-GFP is inactivated faster than SARS-CoV-2 (MHV-GFP ≥ 6.08 log(10); SARS-CoV-2 = 0.66 log(10) at 30 s with 0.05% NaOCl on steel) and MS2 is inactivated more slowly. Phi6 is inactivated like SARS-CoV-2, and we propose Phi6 as a slightly conservative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 chlorine disinfection. Additionally, disinfection of bacteriophages on wood was challenging, and exposure to antimicrobial surfaces had no disinfection efficacy as tested. We recommend using 0.5% chlorine on surfaces for a minimum of 30 s of contact to disinfect SARS-CoV-2 and recommend additional research on Phi6 disinfection with varied surfaces and conditions.","String, Gabrielle M.; White, Mitchell R.; Gute, David M.; Mühlberger, Elke; Lantagne, Daniele S.",Environ Sci Technol Lett,183,1

Success can be limited by dimensional incompatibilities between tracheal tubes (TTs) and SGAs. METHODS In this in vitro study, we tested the feasibility of TT passage through SGAs, removal of SGAs over TTs, and the ability to guide the flexible bronchoscope with 13 TT brands (internal diameter, 6.5-8.0 mm) and ten different SGAs (#4 and #5) in an intubation mannequin. RESULTS We tested 1,040 combinations of SGAs and TTs. Tracheal tube passage failed in 155 (30%) combinations of the five tested first-generation SGAs (117 [46%] with SGA #4, 38 [15%] with SGA #5) and in three (0.6%) combinations of the five tested second-generation SGAs (two [0.8%] with SGA #4 and one [0.4%] with SGA #5). The reason for failed passage of a TT through a first-generation SGA consistently was a too-narrow SGA connector. Removal of the SGA over the TT in the 882 remaining combinations was impossible for all sizes of reinforced TTs, except the Parker Reinforced TT, and was possible for all non-reinforced TTs. Only one combination with SGA #4 and 84 combinations with SGA #5 were not ideal to adequately guide the flexible bronchoscope. CONCLUSION Clinically relevant combinations of adult-size TTs and SGAs can be incompatible, rendering flexible bronchoscope-guided tracheal intubation through an SGA impossible. Additional limitations exist regarding removal of the SGA and maneuverability of the flexible bronchoscope.","Moser, Berthold; Kemper, Michael; Kleine-Brueggeney, Maren; Gasteiger, Lukas; Weiss, Markus",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,183,27

It is a safe and feasible approach in experienced hands. Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has been performed for cholecystectomies, nephrectomies, splenectomies and obesity surgery. However, the use of SILS in liver surgery has been rarely reported. We report our initial experience in seven patients on single incision laparoscopic hepatectomy (SILH). PATIENTS AND METHODS From October 2010 to September 2012, seven patients underwent single-incision laparoscopic liver surgery. The abdomen was approached through a 25 mm periumbilical incision. No supplemental ports were required. The liver was transected using a combination of LigaSure™ (Covidien-Valleylab. Boulder. USA), Harmonic Scalpel and Ligaclips (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.). RESULTS Liver resection was successfully completed for the seven patients. The procedures consisted of two partial resections of segment three, two partial resections of segment five and three partial resections of segment six. The mean operative time was 98.3 min (range: 60-150 min) and the mean estimated blood loss was 57 ml (range: 25-150 ml). The postoperative courses were uneventful and the mean hospital stay was 5.1 days (range: 1-13 days). Pathology identified three benign and four malignant liver tumours with clear margins. CONCLUSION SILH is a technically feasible and safe approach for wedge resections of the liver without oncological compromise and with favourable cosmetic results. This surgical technique requires relatively advanced laparoscopic skills. Further studies are needed to determine the potential advantages of this technique, apart from the better cosmetic result, compared to the conventional laparoscopic approach.","Tayar, Claude; Subar, Daren; Salloum, Chady; Malek, Alexandre; Laurent, Alexis; Azoulay, Daniel",Journal of minimal access surgery,183,1

Its use in the perioperative setting for patients with metastatic disease has not been well studied. We characterize perioperative plasma ctDNA and its association with progression-free survival (PFS) in patients undergoing surgery for peritoneal metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS We recruited 71 patients undergoing surgery for peritoneal metastases and evaluated their plasma with a targeted 73-gene ctDNA next-generation sequencing test before and after surgery. The association between perioperative ctDNA, as well as other patient factors, and PFS was evaluated by Cox regression. RESULTS ctDNA was detectable in 28 patients (39.4%) preoperatively and in 37 patients (52.1%) postoperatively. Patients with high ctDNA [maximum somatic variant allele fraction (MSVAF) > 0.25%] had worse PFS than those with low MSVAF (< 0.25%) in both the pre- and postoperative settings (median 4.8 vs. 19.3 months, p < 0.001, and 9.2 vs.15.0 months, p = 0.049, respectively; log-rank test). On multivariate analysis, high-grade histology [hazard ratio (HR) 3.42, p = 0.001], incomplete resection (HR 2.35, p = 0.010), and high preoperative MSVAF (HR 3.04, p = 0.001) were associated with worse PFS. Patients with new postoperative alterations in the context of preoperative alteration(s) also had a significantly shorter PFS compared with other groups (HR 4.28, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS High levels of perioperative ctDNA and new postoperative ctDNA alterations in the context of preoperative alterations predict worse outcomes in patients undergoing resection for peritoneal metastases. This may highlight a role for longitudinal ctDNA surveillance in this population.","Baumgartner, Joel M; Riviere, Paul; Lanman, Richard B; Kelly, Kaitlyn J; Veerapong, Jula; Lowy, Andrew M; Kurzrock, Razelle",Annals of surgical oncology,183,1

Hybrid operating rooms (HORs) provide real-time image acquisition capabilities allowing the intraoperative placement of markers to facilitate the removal of non-palpable nodules during VATS. OBJECTIVES To present our workflow based on the alternative use of two different markers according to the location of the lung lesion and report our initial results. METHODS All consecutive patients with non-palpable lesions requiring VATS wedge resection underwent localization of the targets in HOR. Lesions were considered non-palpable if they were small (<1 cm), deep (>1 cm from surface), subsolid, or located within a dystrophic area. Anesthetized patients were placed in lateral decubitus. Cone-beam CT (CBCT) was performed, and the needle trajectory was planned using Syngo iGuide Needle Guidance. Metal hook-wire or coil was placed, according to our workflow, close to the lesion and their position was verified by CBCT or fluoroscopy. RESULTS Eleven VATS wedge resections were performed in 10 patients with 12 non-palpable lesions. The localization was performed with seven hook-wires and four coils in 30 minutes (range 17-56 minutes). The median estimated total effective dose was 11.6 mSv (range 1.9-24.7 mSv). Eleven lesions were removed by VATS, and one deep nodule required a thoracotomy. No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS Our experience confirms that HOR is suitable for simultaneous localization and VATS resection of 'difficult' pulmonary lesions. A versatile approach, using different devices, seems advisable for the removal of targets in every clinical scenario, reducing the VATS conversion rate.","Stanzi, Alessia; Mazza, Federico; Lucio, Francesco; Ghirardo, Donatella; Grosso, Maurizio; Locatelli, Alessandro; Melloni, Giulio",The clinical respiratory journal,183,11

We aimed to explore the value of bedside LUS in patients with severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated lung injury. METHODS Sixty-three severe and 33 critical hospitalized subjects with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Bedside LUS was performed in all subjects; chest computed tomography was performed on the same day as bedside LUS in 23 cases. The LUS protocol consisted of 12 scanning zones. LUS score based on B-lines and lung consolidation was evaluated. RESULTS The most common abnormality of LUS was the various forms of B-lines, detected in 93 (96.9%) subjects; as the second most frequent abnormality, 80 (83.3%) subjects exhibited lung consolidation, mainly located in the posterior lung region. Twenty-four (25.0%) subjects had pleural line abnormalities, and 16 (16.7%) had pleural effusion; 78 (81.3%) subjects had ≥ 2 abnormal LUS patterns, and 93 (96.9%) had bilateral lung involvement. The proportion of bilateral or unilateral lung consolidation and pleural effusion in the critical COVID-19 group were higher than that in the severe group (P < .05). The lung consolidation of critical subjects showed a marked increase in most lung areas, including bilateral lateral lung, posterior lung, and left anterior-inferior lung area. The median (interquartile range) LUS scores of critical cases were higher than those of severe cases: left: 14 (12-17) vs 7 (5-12); right: 14 (10-16) vs 8 (3-12); bilateral: 28 (23-31) vs 15 (8-22) (P < .001 for all). There was a good correlation between the LUS score and the chest computed tomography score (r = 0.887, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS The most common abnormal LUS pattern in subjects with severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia was B-lines, followed by lung consolidation. Bedside LUS can provide important information for pulmonary involvement in patients with COVID-19.","Kong, Shuangshuang; Wang, Jing; Li, Yuman; Tian, Ying; Yu, Cheng; Zhang, Danqing; Li, Hong; Zhang, Li; Pang, Xueqin; Xie, Mingxing",Respiratory care,183,1

However, the technique remains technically challenging for most surgeons. We developed a new technique utilizing a needle grasper held in the surgeon's left hand as an alternative to conventional single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC). PATIENTS AND METHODS From August 2011 through May 2013, 29 patients at Nippon Medical School Musashi Kosugi Hospital, with gallbladder stones or polyps underwent single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) with an additional needle grasper that was held in the surgeon's left hand (SILCAN) and introduced in the right subcostal region without a trocar. We analyzed intraoperative and postoperative outcomes of 29 patients for whom SILCAN was performed and retrospectively compared these outcomes to those of 32 patients who underwent conventional 4-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC) from January 2011 through May 2013. RESULTS No differences in patient characteristics or intraoperative/postoperative outcomes were observed between the groups. None of the patients in either group required conversion to an open procedure or additional ports. In the SILCAN group, no patients had complications within the first 4 weeks after surgery, with the exception of 1 patient with severe chronic cholecystitis in whom bile duct stenosis developed due to inadvertent clipping of the common hepatic duct. The frequency of postoperative analgesic use was similar in both groups, although none of the patients in the SILCAN group received analgesics for pain from the small, inconspicuous wound in the right subcostal region. CONCLUSIONS SILCAN is a safe and feasible alternative to SILC which does not compromise the qualities of CLC. It is less technically challenging, and postoperative pain and cosmesis are comparable to those of conventional SILC.","Komine, Osamu; Suzuki, Hideyuki; Watanabe, Masanori; Nomura, Satoshi; Mizutani, Satoshi; Yoshino, Masanori; Chihara, Naoto; Mishima, Keisuke; Oyama, Rina; Uchida, Eiji",Journal of Nippon Medical School = Nippon Ika Daigaku zasshi,183,1

OBJECTIVE The current study aimed to evaluate the effects of fibreoptic-guided advance of DLT on postoperative sore throat and airway injuries associated with intubation. DESIGN A prospective randomised controlled study. SETTING Tertiary hospital, Seongnam, Korea, from January 2018 to January 2019. PATIENTS One hundred twenty three patients undergoing one-lung ventilation with a left-side DLT were randomised into two groups: 62 in the conventional group and 61 in the fibreoptic-guided group. INTERVENTION After entering the glottis, the DLT was rotated left 90° and advanced blindly into the left main bronchus in the conventional group. In the fibreoptic-guided group, DLT was advanced into the main bronchus under the guide of fibreoptic bronchoscope, which had been passed through the bronchial lumen and inserted into the left main bronchus. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was postoperative sore throat at 24 h after operation. The airway injuries were also examined using a bronchoscope during extubation. RESULTS At postoperative 24 h, the fibreoptic-guided group showed lower pain score (P = 0.001) and lower incidence (risk ratio [95% CI]: 0.2 [0.1 to 0.5], P < 0.001) of sore throat, compared with the conventional group. Moreover, tracheal injury was more severe in the conventional group than in the fibreoptic group (P = 0.003). Vocal cord injuries also occurred less frequently in the fibreoptic-guided group (risk ratio [95% CI]: 0.4 [0.2 to 1.0], P = 0.036).

Bariatric surgery is one of the most efficient treatments of morbid obesity. The aims were to assess pancreatic endocrine and exocrine lesions in obese rats, to analyze effects of bariatric surgery. Sixty-three male Wistar rats were included in five groups: 2 fed with high fat diet (HFD) or normal diet for 3 months, 2 fed with HFD or normal diet for 6 months; 1 group fed with HFD and undergoing bariatric surgery (n = 30). Quantitative MR imaging was performed in HFD6, ND6 and HFD3-BS. Pancreas specimens were analyzed after sacrifice for adipocyte infiltration, fibrosis, acinar-ductal metaplasia, abnormality of Langerhans islets (HHF: hypertrophy, hypervascularisation, fibrosis), and hemosiderin deposits in acinar or endocrine locations. We found that HFD6 rats had more fibro-inflammatory islets (P = 0.0139) and acinar-ducal metaplasia (P = 0.0843) than HFD3 rats. Rats with HFD3+6 had more fibro-inflammatory islets (P < 0.0001), hemosiderin deposits (p < 0.0001), fat infiltration (P = 0.0008) and acinar-ductal metaplasia lesions (P = 0.0424). Weight increase was associated with glycoregulation abnormalities (r = 0.44, P = 0.08) and adipocyte infiltrations (P = 0.009). After surgery, less fibro-inflammatory islets (P = 0.0004), fat and iron infiltrates (P = 0.005 and P = 0.06), and acino-ductal metaplasia (P = 0.05) were observed compared to HFD6 rats. MR image quantifications revealed increased elasticity, fat fraction, and R2 and a decreased elasticity wave dispersion coefficient in the high fat groups that reversed after surgery. MRI parameters were in strong correlation with respective histological counterparts. In conclusion, obese rats develop pancreatic inflammatory lesions with acinar-ductal metaplasia in acinar location and the endocrine-exocrine interface. These changes can be prevented by bariatric surgery. Quantitative MR imaging is accurate in identifying early pancreatic lesions.","Rebours, Vinciane; Garteiser, Philippe; Ribeiro-Parenti, Lara; Cavin, Jean-Baptiste; Doblas, Sabrina; Pagé, Gwenaël; Bado, André; Couvineau, Alain; Ruszniewski, Philippe; Paradis, Valérie; Le Gall, Maude; Van Beers, Bernard E; Couvelard, Anne",Scientific reports,183,20

However, they refused any radical surgery. We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with gallbladder bed cautery. The pathology results showed that 2 cases were mixed neuroendocrine carcinoma (NECs), and 1 case was a simple NEC. Chromogranin A and synaptophysin were positive in all cases. The pathological TNM stages of all patients were in the T1bN0M0 stage. The range of Ki-67 was from 40% to 80%. During the at least 26 months' follow-up, there is no case with the recurrence of the carcinoma without any chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

In this study, we focused on the association between low serum prealbumin levels and carpal tunnel syndrome in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients using low-flux dialysis reuse. MATERIALS AND METHODS Serum prealbumin levels were assessed to determine the association between low serum prealbumin levels and CTS in 373 prevalent MHD patients (the mean age was 45 years old, hemodialysis duration was 46 months). The patients were divided into 2 groups: the CTS group with 44 patients and the non-CTS group with 329 patients. RESULTS The prevalence of CTS was 11.8%. Serum prealbumin showed a good prognostic value to predict CTS in MHD patients using low-flux dialysis reuse (the Area Under the Curve = 0.841, p < .001; cutoff value: 26.5 mg/dL with sensitivity = 72.7% and specificity = 79.9%).

COVID-19 is gradually posing a serious threat to global public health. In this review, the characteristics and mechanism of kidney injury caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection are summarized and contrasted. Especially, urine-oral transmission, prevention and management of the kidney injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 were emphasized. MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched PubMed for English language articles published since 2003 with the keywords ""SARS"", ""MERS"", ""COVID-19"" or ""kidney injury"". ClinicalTrials.gov was queried for ongoing studies. We also used relevant data from websites, including Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). RESULTS Similar to two other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 caused severe respiratory syndrome with rapid progression and kidney injury. The infection process of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by specifically binding to ACE2. The COVID-19 patients combined with kidney impairment are associated with a higher risk of mortality, compared with those without comorbidities. The pathological changes of the kidney are mainly due to local SARS-CoV-2 replication or indirectly by pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Besides, studies have confirmed the isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in urine, raising the possibility of urine-oral transmission. Thus, it is significant for preventing possible potential urine-oral transmission and improving the cure rate of acute kidney injury of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Emerging evidence supports that in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections, the prevalence of kidney injury is high and usually leads to a poor prognosis. The optimal prevention, management of kidney injury will benefit for COVID-19 patients.","Lv, Wenchang; Wu, Min; Ren, Yuping; Zeng, Ning; Deng, Pei; Zeng, Hong; Zhang, Qi; Wu, Yiping",The Journal of urology,183,26

We have determined the genome sequences of CyHV1 and CyHV2 and compared them with the published CyHV3 sequence. The CyHV1 and CyHV2 genomes are 291,144 and 290,304 bp, respectively, in size, and thus the CyHV3 genome, at 295,146 bp, remains the largest recorded among the herpesviruses. Each of the three genomes consists of a unique region flanked at each terminus by a sizeable direct repeat. The CyHV1, CyHV2, and CyHV3 genomes are predicted to contain 137, 150, and 155 unique, functional protein-coding genes, respectively, of which six, four, and eight, respectively, are duplicated in the terminal repeat. The three viruses share 120 orthologous genes in a largely colinear arrangement, of which up to 55 are also conserved in the other member of the genus Cyprinivirus, anguillid herpesvirus 1. Twelve genes are conserved convincingly in all sequenced alloherpesviruses, and two others are conserved marginally. The reference CyHV3 strain has been reported to contain five fragmented genes that are presumably nonfunctional. The CyHV2 strain has two fragmented genes, and the CyHV1 strain has none. CyHV1, CyHV2, and CyHV3 have five, six, and five families of paralogous genes, respectively. One family unique to CyHV1 is related to cellular JUNB, which encodes a transcription factor involved in oncogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the first time that JUNB-related sequences have been reported in a herpesvirus.","Davison, Andrew J; Kurobe, Tomofumi; Gatherer, Derek; Cunningham, Charles; Korf, Ian; Fukuda, Hideo; Hedrick, Ronald P; Waltzek, Thomas B",Journal of virology,183,17

METHODS An online survey was hosted by the Norwich Clinical Trials Unit on the secure REDCap server. Members of the charity Fifth Sense (the UK charity that represents and supports people affected by smell and taste disorders) were invited to participate. RESULTS There were 149 respondents, of whom 127 had identified themselves as having (or had) PIOD. The age range of respondents to the survey was 28-85 years, with a mean of 58 ± 12 years, with the duration of their disorder <5 years in 63% of cases. Respondents reported experiencing variable treatment with oral and/or intranasal steroids given typically (28%), often with no benefit, but with 50% receiving no treatment whatsoever; only 3% reported undertaking olfactory training. Over two-thirds of patients experience parosmia and, up to 5 years from the onset of the problem, were still actively seeking a solution. CONCLUSION There appears to be a need to encourage greater use of guidelines for olfactory disorders amongst medical practitioners and also to develop more effective treatments for patients with PIOD, where there is clearly an unmet need.","Philpott, Carl M; Boardman, James; Boak, Duncan",ORL; journal for oto-rhino-laryngology and its related specialties,183,12

Methods: A retrospective analysis was made on 13 cases of hairy polyp confirmed by pathology, who were admitted to the Children's Hospital of Hebei Province from January 2010 to September 2019, including 4 males and 9 females, with a male-female ratio of 1∶2.25. The age ranged from 3 hours to 1 year, and the median age was 1 month. Twelve of the 13 children were found to have difficulty breathing or feeding. All the children received coblation resection under general anesthesia. The root pedicle of the mass was found in the lateral nasopharyngeal wall in 8 cases, in the junction of palatine and palatopharyngeal arch of tonsil and the tongue and esophageal entrance in 1 case, respectively. Nasal septum was found in 2 cases, including 1 case located between two incisors. The wound at the root pedicle was ablated and the bleeding was stopped completely. Results: Postoperative follow-up lasted from 3 months to 2 years, and there was no recurrence in 12 cases. Fibrolaryngoscope showed a mass of the right eustachian tube and pharyngeal mouth in 1 case 2 years after the surgery, which was considered recurrence of hairy polyps and lost after that. Conclusion: Hairy polyps in infants is a rare clinical disease, and its main symptom is upper respiratory tract obstruction.

METHODS Patients operated from 2010 to 2013 by lapPPPD were matched 1:1 for age, sex, histopathology, American Society of Anesthesiologists category and body mass index to oPPPD patients operated from 1996 to 2013. RESULTS Patients eligible for lapPPPD are a risk group due to a high rate of soft pancreata. Complication rate and mortality were comparable to oPPPD. There was a significantly reduced transfusion requirement and a trend towards shorter operation time, less delayed gastric emptying, and reduced hospital stay. The main reason for conversion was portal venous tumor adhesion. Patient selection changed and operation time and hospital stay decreased with the surgeons' experience. CONCLUSION In selected patients, a hybrid laparoscopic technique of pancreatoduodenectomy is feasible with complication rates comparable to the open procedure. There seem to be advantages in terms of transfusion requirement, operation time, and hospital stay.","Wellner, Ulrich Friedrich; Küsters, Simon; Sick, Olivia; Busch, Caroline; Bausch, Dirk; Bronsert, Peter; Hopt, Ulrich Theodor; Karcz, Konrad Wojciech; Keck, Tobias",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,183,24

The degradation of isoproturon, being a typical phenylurea herbicide, has been studied much with advanced oxidation processes. However, little information on the detailed degradation mechanism from the theoretical level is available. In the present work, the degradation mechanisms of OH-initiated reactions of isoproturon were studied at the MPWB1K/6-311+G(3df, 2p)//MPWB1K/6-31+G(d, p) level. The calculation results display that H-atom abstraction, ·OH addition, and ·OH substitution pathways are found for ·OH and isoproturon reactions. For H-atom abstractions, the results show that aliphatic H atoms are more easily abstracted by ·OH than the aromatic H atoms, and the pathway R6 has the lowest energy barrier of 6.65 kcal mol-1, indicating that H in the -CH3 group attached to the N2 atom could be most favorably abstracted. Six pathways for ·OH addition to the six sites of the phenyl ring are identified with low energy barriers, which are in good accordance with the fact that the additions of ·OH to the phenyl ring were the important steps from experimental results. For ·OH substitution reactions, two pathways with high activation energies are found, and the corresponding products have been also detected from previous experimental studies, suggesting that the substitution reactions could also occur.","Ren, Xiaohua; Liu, Ruilong; Zhang, Shanshan; Zhang, Jinying",Journal of molecular modeling,183,1

We included 337 patients who underwent RALM with (n = 160) or without (n = 177) the LSOM technique between March 2019 and August 2020. The LSOM group had low parity and gravidity, with a low rate of Cesarean sections. Myoma type was not different between the groups; however, patients in the LSOM group had larger, heavier, and higher number of myomas, although fewer patients had multiple myomas and were discharged earlier. Total operating time, estimated blood loss, pre- and postoperative hemoglobin levels, transfusion rate, and postoperative fever were not different between the two groups. In conclusion, the LSOM technique may be a viable surgical option for myomas, as it can reduce the cost of RALM by obviating the need for robotic Tenaculum forceps.","Lee, Sa Ra; Lee, Eun Sil; Eum, Hye Lim; Lee, Young-Jae; Lee, Shin-Wha; Park, Jeong Yeol; Suh, Dae-Shik; Kim, Dae-Yeon; Kim, Sung Hoon; Kim, Yong-Man; Kim, Young-Tak",Journal of clinical medicine,183,1

The occurrence and relationships among mental health conditions such as burnout and depression have received little attention. We investigated the prevalence of burnout, depression, anxiety and stress in Australian midwives. METHODS An online survey was conducted in September 2014. Participants were recruited through the Australian College of Midwives and professional networks. The survey sought personal and professional details. Standard measures included the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) (Personal, Work and Client subscales), and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS). The sample was collapsed into two groups according to DASS clinical cut-offs (normal/mild versus moderate/severe/extreme). Effect size statistics were calculated and judged according to Cohen's guidelines. RESULTS One thousand thirty-seven surveys were received. Respondents were predominantly female (98%), with an average age of 46.43 years, and 16.51 years of practice. Using a CBI subscale cut-off score of 50 and above (moderate and higher), 64.9% (n = 643) reported personal burnout; 43.8% (n = 428) reported work-related burnout; and 10.4% (n = 102) reported client-related burnout. All burnout subscales were significantly correlated with depression, anxiety and stress, particularly personal and work-related burnout with Spearman's rho correlations ranging from .51 to .63 (p < .001). Around 20% of midwives reported moderate/ severe/ extreme levels of depression (17.3%); anxiety (20.4%), and stress (22.1%) symptoms. Mann-Whitney U tests revealed significant differences between groups with depression (r = .43), anxiety (r = .41) and stress (r = 48) having a medium size effect on burnout. CONCLUSION Prevalence of personal and work-related burnout in Australian midwives was high. The physical and psychological exhaustion associated with the different types of burnout were reflected in symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. Further research is needed to support the personal well-being of midwives and minimize workplace burnout by developing short and long term strategies.","Creedy, D K; Sidebotham, M; Gamble, J; Pallant, Julie; Fenwick, J",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,183,1

This study explored the dynamics of collaboration among frontline health professionals participating in two MNCH coordination structures in a rural South African district. It examined the role and position of actors, the nature of their relationships, and the overall structure of the collaborative network in two sub-districts. METHODS Cross-sectional survey using a social network analysis (SNA) methodology of 42 district and sub district actors involved in MNCH coordination structures. Different domains of collaboration (eg, communication, professional support, innovation) were surveyed at key interfaces (district-sub-district, across service delivery levels, and within teams). RESULTS The overall network structure reflected a predominantly hierarchical mode of clustering of organisational relationships around hospitals and their referring primary healthcare (PHC) facilities. Clusters were linked through (and dependent on) a combination of district MNCH programme and line managers, identified as central connectors or boundary spanners. Overall network density remained low suggesting potential for strengthening collaborative relationships. Within cluster collaborative patterns (inter-professional and across levels) varied, highlighting the significance of small units in district functioning. CONCLUSION SNA provides a mechanism to uncover the nature of relationships and key actors in collaborative dynamics which could point to system strengths and weaknesses. It offers insights on the level of fragmentation within and across small units, and the need to strengthen cohesion and improve collaborative relationships, and ultimately, the delivery of health services.","Mukinda, Fidele Kanyimbu; Van Belle, Sara; Schneider, Helen",International journal of health policy and management,183,26

DESIGN A cross-sectional study of nurses working in pediatric, obstetric, and internal wards of two medical centers in Israel between February and October 2018. METHODS Participants completed anonymous questionnaires about genomic knowledge, SEA, perceived importance of genomics, and the performance of genomic skills in nursing practice. Associations between variables were analyzed using Pearson correlations, and a hierarchical regression model was used to determine which variables explained the performance of genomic practices among participants. FINDINGS Altogether 423 nurses participated in the study. The mean genomic knowledge was low (55.05 ± 14.82%). Nurses reported a low integration of genomic skills in their practice (M = 1.90, SD = 0.71), although their overall perceived importance of genomics was positive (M = 2.88, SD = 0.68). Positive correlations were found between SEA and the integration of genomic skills in nursing practice. Obstetric nurses had more genomic knowledge, more positive perceptions about genomics, and performed more genomic skills in their nursing practice. CONCLUSIONS Although nurses realized the importance of genomics to their practice, and genomics is part of the Israeli nursing core curriculum, we found disappointingly low levels of knowledge and performance of genomic skills in nursing practice.

Medications are integral to the management and control of CVD; however, suboptimal adherence impacts health outcomes. This systematic review aims to critically examine interventions targeted at improving medication adherence among persons with CVD in LMICs. Methods In this systematic review, we searched online databases PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL for studies that evaluated a medication adherence intervention for CVD, reported adherence as an outcome measure, were conducted in LMICs and reported the strategy or tool used to measure adherence. We included articles published in English, available in full text, peer-reviewed, and published between 2010 and 2020. Results We included 45 articles in this review. The majority of the studies implemented counseling and educational interventions led by nurses, pharmacists, or community health workers. Many of the studies delivered medication-taking reminders in the form of phone calls, text messages, short message services (SMS), and in-phone calendars. Multi-component interventions were more effective than unifocal interventions. Interventions involving technology, such as mobile phone calls, electronic pillboxes, and interactive phone SMS reminders, were more effective than generic reminders. The outcomes reported in the studies varied based on the complexity and combination of strategies. When interventions were implemented at both the patient level, such as reminders, and at the provider level, such as team-based care, the effect on medication adherence was larger. Conclusion In LMICs, medication adherence interventions among persons with CVD included a combination of patient education, reminders, fixed-dose combination therapy and team-based care approach were generally more effective than singular interventions. Among patients who had CVD, the medication adherence interventions were found to be moderately effective. Future studies focusing on improving medication adherence in LMICs should consider non-physician-led interventions and appropriately adapt the interventions to the local context.","Ogungbe, Oluwabunmi; Byiringiro, Samuel; Adedokun-Afolayan, Adeola; Seal, Stella M; Dennison Himmelfarb, Cheryl R; Davidson, Patricia M; Commodore-Mensah, Yvonne",Patient preference and adherence,183,24

ClpB3 oligomerizes into active hexamers that resolubilize aggregated substrates using ATP and without the aid of partners. Disaggregases from the Hsp100/Clp family are a type of molecular chaperones involved in disassembling protein aggregates. Plant cells are uniquely endowed with ClpB proteins in the cytosol, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Chloroplastic ClpB proteins have been implicated in key processes like the unfolded protein response; however, they have not been studied in detail. In this study, we explored the biochemical properties of a chloroplastic ClpB disaggregase, in particular, ClpB3 from A. thaliana. ClpB3 was produced recombinantly in Escherichia coli and affinity-purified to near homogeneity. ClpB3 forms a hexameric complex in the presence of MgATP and displays intrinsic ATPase activity. We demonstrate that ClpB3 has ATPase activity in a wide range of pH and temperature values and is particularly resistant to heat. ClpB3 specifically targets unstructured polypeptides and mediates the reactivation of heat-denatured model substrates without the aid of the Hsp70 system. Overall, this work represents the first in-depth biochemical description of a ClpB protein from plants and strongly supports its role as the putative disaggregase chaperone in chloroplasts.","Parcerisa, Ivana L; Rosano, Germán L; Ceccarelli, Eduardo A",Plant molecular biology,183,1

The COVID-19 pandemic and restrictive measures enforced in residential settings have resulted in changes in daily routine and modified the ways families can interact with and provide support to residents. Yet, the impact of these changes has not been empirically explored. AIM Explore how family caregivers have interacted with and supported their relatives with DD residing in supported accommodation during the pandemic. METHODS Changes in frequencies of communication modes and types of informal support were measured through a cross-sectional and anonymous online survey which completed by 108 family caregivers of adults with DD.

The post-COVID era: A time for action.,16.589539,3.1371782,2020-07-20,"BACKGROUND Type 2 diabetes mellitus has serious health consequences, including blindness, amputation, and stroke. Researchers and clinicians are increasingly in agreement that type 2 diabetes may be effectively treated with a carbohydrate-reduced diet. Digital apps are increasingly used as an adjunct to traditional health care provisions to support remote self-management of long-term health conditions. OBJECTIVE Our objective was to evaluate the real-world 12-month outcomes of patients prescribed the Low Carb Program digital health intervention at a primary care National Health Service (NHS) site. The Low Carb Program is a nutritionally focused, 12-session, digitally delivered, educational behavior change intervention for glycemic control and weight loss for adults with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. The program educates and supports sustainable dietary changes focused on carbohydrate restriction by utilizing behavior change techniques, including goal setting, peer support, and behavioral self-monitoring, as well as personalized downloadable resources, including recipes and meal plans tailored to ethnicity, weekly shopping budget, and dietary preferences. METHODS This study evaluated the real-world outcomes of patients recruited to the Low Carb Program at an NHS general practice in Southport, United Kingdom. All of the NHS patients recruited to the program were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes and were given access to the program at no cost. A total of 45 participants, with a mean age of 54.8 years (SD 13.2), were included in the study. Women made up 42% (19/45) of the sample. The mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of the sample was 56.7 mmol/mol (SD 16.95) and the mean body weight was 89.4 kg (SD 13.8). RESULTS Of the 45 study participants recruited to the program, all of them (100%) activated their accounts and 37 (82%) individuals reported outcomes at 12 months. All 45 (100%) patients completed at least 40% of the lessons and 32 (71%) individuals completed more than nine out of 12 core lessons of the program. Glycemic control and weight loss improved, particularly for participants who completed more than nine core lessons in the program over 12 months. The mean HbA1c went from 58.8 mmol/mol at baseline to 54.0 mmol/mol, representing a mean reduction of 4.78 mmol/mol (SD 4.60; t31=5.87; P<.001). Results showed an average total body weight reduction of 4.17%, with an average weight reduction of 3.85 kg (SD 2.49; t31=9.27; P<.001) at the 12-month follow-up point. CONCLUSIONS A digital app prescribed to adults with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in a primary care setting supporting a transition to a low-carbohydrate diet has been shown to be effective in improving glycemic control and enabling weight loss. Further research to understand more about factors affecting engagement with the app and further positive health implications would be valuable.","Summers, Charlotte; Tobin, Simon; Unwin, David",JMIR diabetes,183,8

However, evaluation of flow jets is often unreliable due to a large variation of flow jet on the digital subtraction angiograms, and this flow pattern variation may result in incorrect clinical diagnosis Therefore, factors contributing to the variation in flow jet are examined at an in vitro setting, and the findings can help us to understand the nature of flow jet and devise a better plan to quantify the aneurysmal hemodynamics accurately. METHODS Intra-aneurysmal flows in three patient-specific aneurysms between 11 and 25 mm were investigated in vitro, and a FD was deployed in each aneurysm model. X-ray imaging of these models were performed at injection rates between 0.2 and 2 mL/s. Pulsatile blood pump and aneurysm model were imaged together to determine the timing of flow jet. RESULTS The contrast bolus arrives at the aneurysm early at high contrast injection rates. The flow patterns with slow injection rates exhibit strong inertia that is associated with the systole flow. Flow jets arrive at the aneurysms at the peak systole when the bolus is injected at 0.2 mL/s. The contrast-to-signal ratio is the highest at the injection rate of 0.5 mL/s. Effect of flow diversion can only be assessed at an injection rate greater than 0.5 mL/s. CONCLUSIONS Intra-aneurysmal flow jet is highly dependent on the injection rate of the contrast agent. For the internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms, the systolic flows can be visualized at slow injection rates (<0.5 mL/s), while the diastolic flow jets are visible at higher injection rates (>1 mL/s). Dependence of flow jet on the contrast injection rate has serious clinical implications and needs to be considered during diagnostic procedures; a protocol with a consistent injection rate is highly recommended.","Jou, Liang-der; Desai, Virendra R; Britz, Garvin W",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,183,1

Here, we discuss two cases of tracheal injury following median sternotomy during cardiac surgery. CASE PRESENTATION Ventilation failure occurred in a 78-year-old Japanese man and a 71-year-old Japanese man after median sternotomy, and tracheal injury was identified. The sites of injury were directly repaired and covered with mediastinal fat tissue, following which ventilation was successful. The burn-like deposits observed at the site of tracheal injury and on the removed endotracheal tube support the notion that the injuries in our patients were caused by electrocautery prior to median sternotomy. In one case, short sternotracheal distance may have contributed to tracheal injury during post-sternal manipulation. In both cases, the relative inexperience of both surgeons also supports the suspected cause of injury. CONCLUSIONS Tracheal injury represents a potential complication following median sternotomy, especially when performed by inexperienced surgeons or in cases of short sternotracheal distance. Anesthesiologists should consider this rare yet potentially lethal complication.","Takeshita, Jun; Nishiyama, Kei; Fukumoto, Atsushi; Ohira, Suguru; Beppu, Satoru; Sasahashi, Nozomu; Shime, Nobuaki",Journal of medical case reports,183,1

CT and US images were obtained simultaneously at 1, 3, and 5 min during ablation and 2, 5, and 10 min post-ablation. Each ablation was sectioned in the plane of the ultrasound image and underwent vital staining to delineate cellular necrosis. CT was reformatted to the same plane as the ultrasound transducer and transverse diameters of gas and hypoechoic/hypoattenuating zones at each time point were measured. CT, ultrasound and gross pathologic diameter measurements were compared using Student's t-tests and linear regression.Results: Visible gas and the hypoechoic zone on US images were more predictive of the pathologic ablation zone than on NCCT images (p < 0.05). The zone of necrosis was larger than the zone of visible gas on US (mean 3.2 mm for microwave, 6.4 mm for RF) and NCCT (7.6 mm microwave, 13.9 mm RF) images (p < 0.05). The zone of visible gas and hypoechoic zone on US are more predictive of pathology with microwave ablations when compared with RF ablations (p < 0.05).Conclusion: When evaluating images during energy delivery, US is more accurate than CT and microwave- more predictable than RF-ablation based on correlation with in-plane pathology.","Ziemlewicz, Timothy J; Hinshaw, J Louis; Lubner, Meghan G; Knott, Emily A; Willey, Bridgett J; Lee, Fred T; Brace, Christopher L","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",183,11

Under the current standard of care, affected patients are subjected to a lifelong journey of corrective surgeries and multidisciplinary management to replace bone and soft tissues, as well as restore esthetics and physiologic functions while restoring self-esteem and psychological health. Hence, a better understanding of the dynamic interplay of molecular signaling pathways at critical phases of palate development is necessary to pioneer novel prenatal interventions. Such pathways include transforming growth factor-β (Tgfβ), sonic hedgehog (Shh), wingless-integrated site (Wnt)/β-catenin, bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp), and fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) and its associated receptors, among others. Here, we summarize commonly used surgical methods used to correct cleft defects postnatally. We also review the advances made in prenatal diagnostics of clefts through imaging and genomics and the various in utero surgical corrections that have been attempted thus far. An overview of how key mediators of signaling that drive palatogenesis are emphasized in the context of the framework and rationale for the development and testing of therapeutics in animal model systems and in humans is provided. The pros and cons of in utero therapies that can potentially restore molecular homeostasis needed for the proper growth and fusion of palatal shelves are presented. The theme advanced throughout this review is the need to develop preclinical molecular therapies that could ultimately be translated into human trials that can correct orofacial clefts at earlier stages of development.","Oliver, J D; Turner, E C; Halpern, L R; Jia, S; Schneider, P; D'Souza, R N",Journal of dental research,183,1

METHODS Bilateral resting and active motor thresholds (RMT, AMT) were gathered using transcranial magnetic stimulation among 82 MS patients. Corticospinal excitability (CSE) asymmetry was expressed as the ratio between weaker and stronger sides' RMT and AMT. Stronger and weaker side was determined by pinch and grip strength. We examined whether CSE asymmetry predicted symptoms. RESULTS AMT asymmetry ratio revealed atypical CSE asymmetry whereby the hemisphere associated with the weaker hand was more excitable in early MS. After controlling for MS disease demographics, shifting of CSE asymmetry towards greater excitability in the stronger side significantly predicted more severe symptoms including Expanded Disease Severity Scale, nine-hole peg test, cognitive processing speed, walking speed, heat sensitivity, fatigue, and subjective impact of MS. CONCLUSION CSE asymmetry significantly predicted the severity of MS-related physical and objective cognitive symptoms. The phenomenon may be related to neuroinflammation-mediated hyperexcitability. Shifting of asymmetry toward less excitability on the weaker side may suggest the onset of a more neurodegenerative phase of the disease. SIGNIFICANCE Shifting of hemispheric excitability, detected using a CSE asymmetry ratio, may be a useful biomarker to track disease progression and understand the benefits of treatments.","Chaves, Arthur R; Wallack, Elizabeth M; Kelly, Liam P; Pretty, Ryan W; Wiseman, Hailey D; Chen, Alice; Moore, Craig S; Stefanelli, Mark; Ploughman, Michelle",Behavioural brain research,183,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS Ninety-three treatment-naïve HCCs from 80 patients treated with RFA from August 2012 to December 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Seventy-five HCCs from 65 patients underwent B-mode US-guided RFA, and 15 HCCs from 14 patients that were inconspicuous on B-mode US underwent CEUS-guided RFA during the arterial phase after injection of sulfur hexafluoride microbubbles (SonoVue®). Technical success was assessed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography within 1 week and 3 months after the procedure. RESULTS The mean size of HCCs treated with CEUS-guided RFA was smaller than that of HCCs treated with B-mode US-guided RFA (1.17±0.36 vs. 1.63±0.55 cm, p=0.003). Technical success rates of CEUS-guided RFA within 1 week and 3 months were 100% (15/15) and 93.3% (14/15), respectively. Technical success rates of B-mode US-guided RFA were 97.3% (73/75) and 94.5% (69/73), respectively.

Methods: Retrospective data analysis of clinical signalment, surgery, athletic outcome, intra- and postoperative complications, and postoperative examinations from clinical cases wherein EVC was performed in conjunction with traditional prosthetic laryngoplasty from one practice. Owners were contacted by phone or email for a follow-up questionnaire. Results: Twenty-four horses underwent unilateral EVC, performed transendoscopically under sedated restraint, using monopolar electrosurgical instrumentation successfully. One horse experienced excessive intraoperative hemorrhage. No horses demonstrated postoperative complications. Twenty cases had a history of increased airway noise prior to surgery. In 15 of these cases (15/20, 75%), the airway noise was reported as fully improved post-surgery. Eighteen cases had a history of exercise intolerance prior to surgery.

Emerging literature suggests that individual and social-structural factors may uniquely increase HIV risk within this population during key developmental periods, namely adolescence (ages 10-17 years) and emerging adulthood (ages 18-25 years). Few studies, however, have compared drivers of risk within and between these key developmental periods. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of recent literature to characterize and identify important gaps in our understanding of the individual, psychosocial, and social-structural determinants of HIV risk among Black adolescent girls and emerging adult women. Design Using a replicable strategy, we searched electronic databases for articles and abstracts published between October 1, 2017 and September 30, 2019 in which the primary focus was on HIV prevention among Black adolescent girls and emerging adults in the United States. Results In total, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies on Black adolescent girls assessed family functioning, parental monitoring, and parent-adolescent communication as determinants of HIV-related behaviors. However, equivalent studies were lacking for Black emerging adult women. Moreover, few studies assessed neighborhood characteristics, social networks, or other community-level factors as determinants of HIV-related behaviors, which are known drivers of HIV disparities. Conclusions Our findings highlighted several gaps in the literature, including failure to recognize the ethnic and cultural differences among Black women that may contribute to behavioral differences within this population and insufficient acknowledgment of the role of HIV protective factors (eg, resilience and community assets).

She draws on the concepts of Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein, Wilfred Bion, Herbert Rosenfeld and Otto Kernberg, which build on each other, and drafts the basic features of a psychoanalytic explanatory model of destructive populist social processes. She illustrates the phenomenon of the »destructive populist fit« between Trump and his followers by means of an analysis of Donald Trump's well-documented election campaigns in 2016 and 2020, supplemented by his actions during the COVID 19 crisis in 2020. On the psychoanalytical understanding of the effectiveness of his methods and the susceptibility of voters to destructive populism, she applies Bion's model of containing in conjunction with Herbert Rosenfeld's destructive narcissism and develops the concept of »perverted containing«: in the course of regression to a paranoid-schizoid level, aggressively destructive and omnipotent affects are idealised and the container function of democratic society is increasingly decomposed, distorted and finally twisted.

The objectives of this study were: (1) to synthesize data on retention in care over time in option B+ programs in Africa, and (2) to identify factors associated with retention in care. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, and African Index Medicus were systematically searched from January 2012 to June 2017. Pooled estimates of the proportion of women retained were generated and factors associated with retention were analyzed thematically. RESULTS Thirty-five articles were included in the final review; 22 reported retention rates (n = 60,890) and 25 reported factors associated with retention. Pooled estimates of retention were 72.9% (95% confidence interval: 66.4% to 78.9%) at 6 months for studies reporting <12 months of follow-up and 76.4% (95% confidence interval: 69.0% to 83.1%) at 12 months for studies reporting ≥12 months of follow-up. Data on undocumented clinic transfers were largely absent. Risk factors for poor retention included younger age, initiating antiretroviral therapy on the same day as diagnosis, initiating during pregnancy versus breastfeeding, and initiating late in the pregnancy. Retention was compromised by stigma, fear of disclosure, and lack of social support. CONCLUSIONS Retention rates in prevention of mother-to-child transmission under option B+ were below those of the general adult population, necessitating interventions targeting the complex circumstances of women initiating care under option B+. Improved and standardized procedures to track and report retention are needed to accurately represent care engagement and capture undocumented transfers within the health system.","Knettel, Brandon A; Cichowitz, Cody; Ngocho, James Samwel; Knippler, Elizabeth T; Chumba, Lilian N; Mmbaga, Blandina T; Watt, Melissa H",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,183,1

A (k)new challenge in the post-Covid World.,16.276295,3.201319,2020-06-03,"BACKGROUND Rural access to surgical care has reached crisis level. Practicing in rural America offers unique challenges with limited resources and specialists. Most training programs do not provide enough exposure to the endoscopic or the surgical subspecialty skills to prepare a resident for an isolated rural environment. As awareness has increased, many programs have modified curriculum to address this need. The Advisory Council on Rural Surgery (ACRS) of the American College of Surgeons set out to delineate important components of rural training programs and measure to what degree the existing heterogeneous programs contain these components. STUDY DESIGN The ACRS identified 4 essential components of rural surgical training based on literature and expert opinion. These components included rotations in a rural setting, broad exposure to surgical specialties, endoscopy experience, and lack of competing specialty learners. A list of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education programs from a prior publication was updated with the 2019 Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database self-identified ""rural track"" programs, reviewed, and categorized. RESULTS We identified 39 programs that self-identified as having a rural emphasis. Depending on the extent of which 4 essential components were included, programs were categorized as either ""Broad"" (12 programs), ""Basic"" (20 programs), or ""Indeterminate"" (7 programs). CONCLUSION The ACRS described the optimal components of a rural surgical training program and identified which components are present in those surgical residencies which self-identified as having a rural focus. This information is valuable to students planning a future in rural surgery and benefits programs hoping to enhance their curriculum to meet this critical need.","Rossi, Isolina; Rossi, Matthew; Mclaughlin, Emily; Minor, Derek; Smithson, Lauren; Borgstrom, David; Sarap, Michael; Deveney, Karen",The American surgeon,183,1

Case report: We reported a case of a 68-year-old asymptomatic male referred with a cataract in his right eye (OD). Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 70 letters (20/ 40) in the OD and 85 letters (20/ 20) in the left eye (OS). Ophthalmological examination revealed a significant nuclear cataract in the OD that explained the visual acuity. Fundus imaging showed a faint nasal margin elevation of the optic disc of both eyes (OU). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed a sectorial retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) atrophy in the inferior quadrant in the OS. Nevertheless, visual field (VF) did not demonstrate defects. Neuroimaging was normal and examination of CSF revealed an opening pressure of 500 mmH2O. A diagnosis of IIH was confirmed and acetazolamide 250 mg twice daily was recommended. After 12 months of follow-up, RNFL thickness remained stable and VF did not confirm defects. Conclusion: A routine eye examination was the onset of IIH in our case. Thus, the ophthalmologist played a crucial role in the early diagnosis of this syndrome. Papilledema is usually a key criterion for IIH, so after its detection, exclusion diagnosis and treatment should be initiated in order to avoid permanent visual loss.","Sargues, Lidia Remolí; Sanchis, María Isabel Soler; Adsuara, Clara Monferrer; Villanueva, Carolina García; Salvador, Belén López; Taulet, Enrique Cervera",Romanian journal of ophthalmology,183,6

(practice point). GUIDELINE 2A Identification of fast peritoneal solute transfer rate (PSTR): It is recommended that the PSTR is determined from a 4-h peritoneal equilibration test (PET), using either 2.5%/2.27% or 4.25%/3.86% dextrose/glucose concentration and creatinine as the index solute. (practice point) This should be done early in the course dialysis treatment (between 6 weeks and 12 weeks) (GRADE 1A) and subsequently when clinically indicated. (practice point). GUIDELINE 2B Clinical implications and mitigation of fast solute transfer: A faster PSTR is associated with lower survival on PD. (GRADE 1A) This risk is in part due to the lower ultrafiltration (UF) and increased net fluid reabsorption that occurs when the PSTR is above the average value. The resulting lower net UF can be avoided by shortening glucose-based exchanges, using a polyglucose solution (icodextrin), and/or prescribing higher glucose concentrations. (GRADE 1A) Compared to glucose, use of icodextrin can translate into improved fluid status and fewer episodes of fluid overload. (GRADE 1A) Use of automated PD and icodextrin may mitigate the mortality risk associated with fast PSTR. (practice point). GUIDELINE 3 Recognizing low UF capacity: This is easy to measure and a valuable screening test. Insufficient UF should be suspected when either (a) the net UF from a 4-h PET is <400 ml (3.86% glucose/4.25% dextrose) or <100 ml (2.27% glucose /2.5% dextrose), (GRADE 1B) and/or (b) the daily UF is insufficient to maintain adequate fluid status. (practice point) Besides membrane dysfunction, low UF capacity can also result from mechanical problems, leaks or increased fluid absorption across the peritoneal membrane not explained by fast PSTR. GUIDELINE 4A Diagnosing intrinsic membrane dysfunction (manifesting as low osmotic conductance to glucose) as a cause of UF insufficiency: When insufficient UF is suspected, the 4-h PET should be supplemented by measurement of the sodium dip at 1 h using a 3.86% glucose/4.25% dextrose exchange for diagnostic purposes. A sodium dip ≤5 mmol/L and/or a sodium sieving ratio ≤0.03 at 1 h indicates UF insufficiency. (GRADE 2B). GUIDELINE 4B Clinical implications of intrinsic membrane dysfunction (de novo or acquired): in the absence of residual kidney function, this is likely to necessitate the use of hypertonic glucose exchanges and possible transfer to haemodialysis. Acquired membrane injury, especially in the context of prolonged time on treatment, should prompt discussions about the risk of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis. (practice point). GUIDELINE 5 Additional membrane function tests: measures of peritoneal protein loss, intraperitoneal pressure and more complex tests that estimate osmotic conductance and 'lymphatic' reabsorption are not recommended for routine clinical practice but remain valuable research methods. (practice point). GUIDELINE 6 Socioeconomic considerations: When resource constraints prevent the use of routine tests, consideration of membrane function should still be part of the clinical management and may be inferred from the daily UF in response to the prescription. (practice point).","Morelle, Johann; Stachowska-Pietka, Joanna; Öberg, Carl; Gadola, Liliana; La Milia, Vincenzo; Yu, Zanzhe; Lambie, Mark; Mehrotra, Rajnish; de Arteaga, Javier; Davies, Simon",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,183,29

The assays were performed on a panel of 192 nasopharyngeal-secretion specimens collected from 81 children under 1 year of age with upper respiratory tract symptoms. To resolve discordant results and confirm pathogens detected only by the larger FilmArray panel, we performed laboratory-developed real-time PCR assays. Among viruses detectable by both commercial assays (adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3, and respiratory syncytial virus), the FilmArray and Prodesse assays showed good overall agreement (181/192 [94.3%]; kappa = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.94). FilmArray RP detected more parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3 than ProParaflu+ (18 versus 13) while ProAdeno+ detected more adenoviruses (11 versus 6), but these differences were not statistically significant. Additionally, FilmArray RP detected 138 pathogens (confirmed as true positives) not included in the Prodesse assays (rhinovirus [RV]/enterovirus [EV], 118; bocavirus, 8; coronavirus, 7; parainfluenza virus 4, 4; Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 1). FilmArray RP was cleared by the FDA following the completion of this study. The FDA-cleared version includes the following targets: adenovirus, coronaviruses HKU1 and NL63, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza A virus (to type level only), influenza A H1 seasonal virus, influenza A H3 seasonal virus, influenza A virus H1-2009, influenza B virus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and RV/EV (no differentiation). The larger panel in the FilmArray RP assay allowed the detection of additional respiratory pathogens compared to the Prodesse assays. In this population of young children with upper respiratory tract infection, RV/EV accounted for the majority of the additional pathogens detected by FilmArray RP.","Loeffelholz, M J; Pong, D L; Pyles, R B; Xiong, Y; Miller, A L; Bufton, K K; Chonmaitree, T",Journal of clinical microbiology,183,16

To better understand the health impacts of transportation initiatives, we conducted a systematic review of longitudinal health evaluations involving: a) bus rapid transit (BRT); b) bicycle lanes; c) Open Streets programs; and d) aerial trams/cable cars. We also synthesized systems-based simulation studies of the health-related consequences of walking, bicycling, aerial tram, bus and BRT use. Two reviewers screened 3302 unique titles and abstracts identified through a systematic search of MEDLINE (Ovid), Scopus, TRID and LILACS databases. We included 39 studies: 29 longitudinal evaluations and 10 simulation studies. Five studies focused on low- and middle-income contexts. Of the 29 evaluation studies, 19 focused on single component bicycle lane interventions; the rest evaluated multi-component interventions involving: bicycle lanes (n = 5), aerial trams (n = 1), and combined bicycle lane/BRT systems (n = 4). Bicycle lanes and BRT systems appeared effective at increasing bicycle and BRT mode share, active transport duration, and number of trips using these modes. Of the 10 simulation studies, there were 9 agent-based models and one system dynamics model. Five studies focused on bus/BRT expansions and incentives, three on interventions for active travel, and the rest investigated combinations of public transport and active travel policies. Synergistic effects were observed when multiple policies were implemented, with several studies showing that sizable interventions are required to significantly shift travel mode choices. Our review indicates that bicycle lanes and BRT systems represent promising initiatives for promoting population health. There is also evidence to suggest that synergistic effects might be achieved through the combined implementation of multiple transportation policies. However, more rigorous evaluation and simulation studies focusing on low- and middle-income countries, aerial trams and Open Streets programs, and a more diverse set of health and health equity outcomes is required.","Stankov, Ivana; Garcia, Leandro M T; Mascolli, Maria Antonietta; Montes, Felipe; Meisel, José D; Gouveia, Nelson; Sarmiento, Olga L; Rodriguez, Daniel A; Hammond, Ross A; Caiaffa, Waleska Teixeira; Diez Roux, Ana V",Environmental research,183,1

We aimed to investigate the differential expression of five miRNAs (21, 200c, 204, 205, and 211) in benign naevi (n = 42), dysplastic naevi (n = 41), melanoma in situ (n = 42), and melanoma (n = 42) and evaluate their potential as diagnostic biomarkers of melanocytic lesions. Real-time PCR showed differential miRNA expression profiles between benign naevi; dysplastic naevi and melanoma in situ; and invasive melanoma. We applied a random forest machine learning algorithm to classify cases based on their miRNA expression profiles, which resulted in a ROC curve analysis of 0.99 for malignant melanoma and greater than 0.9 for all other groups. This indicates an overall very high accuracy of our panel of miRNAs as a diagnostic biomarker of benign, dysplastic, and malignant melanocytic lesions. However, the impact of variable lesion percentage and spatial expression patterns of miRNAs on these real-time PCR results was also considered. In situ hybridisation confirmed the expression of miRNA 21 and 211 in melanocytes, while demonstrating expression of miRNA 205 only in keratinocytes, thus calling into question its value as a biomarker of melanocytic lesions. In conclusion, we have validated some miRNAs, including miRNA 21 and 211, as potential diagnostic biomarkers of benign, dysplastic, and malignant melanocytic lesions. However, we also highlight the crucial importance of considering tissue morphology and spatial expression patterns when using molecular techniques for the discovery and validation of new biomarkers.","Quiohilag, Katherine; Caie, Peter; Oniscu, Anca; Brenn, Thomas; Harrison, David",Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,183,1

We aimed to synthesize the literature on the association between childhood vaccination and allergy. DESIGN We searched the electronic databases PubMed and EMBASE (January 1946- January 2018) using vaccination and allergy terms. METHODS Two authors selected papers according to inclusion criteria. Pooled effects across studies were estimated using random-effects meta-analysis. Due to inadequate number of homogeneous publications on newer and underused vaccines, meta-analysis was limited to allergic outcomes following administration of (Bacillus-Calmette-Guérin) BCG, measles or pertussis vaccination. The review was prospectively registered in the PROSPERO systematic review registry (NO: CRD42017071009). RESULTS A total of 35 publications based on cohort studies and 7 publications based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria. RCTs: From 2 studies, early vaccination with BCG vaccine was associated with a reduced risk of eczema (RR= 0.83; 95% CI= 0.73 - 0.93; I2 = 0%) but not food allergy or asthma. No association was found between pertussis vaccine and any allergic outcome based on a single RCT. Cohort studies: Childhood measles vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of eczema (RR= 0.65; 95% CI= 0.47 - 0.90, I2 = 0.0%), asthma (RR= 0.78; 95% CI= 0.62 - 0.98, I2 = 93.9%) and, with a similar, statistically non-significant reduction in sensitisation (RR= 0.78; 95% CI= 0.61 - 1.01, I2 = 19.4%). CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence that childhood vaccination with commonly administered vaccines were associated with increased risk of later allergic disease. Our results from pooled analysis of both RCTs and cohort studies suggest that vaccination with BCG, and measles vaccines were associated with a reduced risk of eczema.","Navaratna, Samidi; Estcourt, Marie J; Burgess, John; Waidyatillake, Nilakshi; Enoh, Elizabeth; Lowe, Adrian J; Peters, Rachel; Koplin, Jennifer; Dhamage, Shyamali C; Lodge, Caroline J",Allergy,183,1

METHODS Fourteen patients with anal canal to mid-rectum cancers were recruited and underwent single-access laparoscopic surgery via the glove technique. An incision was made at the paraumbilicus to insert a wound protector with surgical gloves. The operation was medial to lateral and inferior mesenteric artery and inferior mesenteric vein were identified and controlled. Total mesorectal excision was performed while keeping traction and countertraction down to the pelvic floor. RESULTS Average operative time was 251.66 min (range, 180-300 min). Hospital stay ranged from 5 to 8 days (median, 7 days). No serious early postoperative surgical problems related to complications were observed. The pathologic results showed good mesorectal capsule grading. The mean lymph node harvest was 14 nodes (range, 7-26 nodes), and the mean wound length was 5 cm (range, 4-6 cm).

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to find whether moderate to complex pilonidal sinuses could be treated using the cleft-lift procedure with local anesthesia, with only minor postoperative pain and brief sick leave. DESIGN This is a prospective cohort study. SETTING The study was conducted in a day-surgical department. PATIENTS Eighty-three consecutive cleft-lift operations for pilonidal sinus were performed with tumescent local anesthesia. INTERVENTIONS Tumescent local anesthesia with a saline water solution of 0.8 mg/mL mepivacaine and 0.001 mg/mL adrenalin buffered with sodium bicarbonate to pH 7.2 was infused subcutaneously. Seventy-five patients were interviewed daily by phone for 1 week to register their ability to return to work and to score their pain on a Numerical Rating Scale pain score from 0 (no pain) to 10. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcome measures were the rate of conversion to general anesthesia, peri- and postoperative pain, and the times to discharge and to return to work. RESULTS Eighty-two (99%) of the 83 procedures were performed with local anesthesia. In one patient, local was converted to general anesthesia. The mean maximum pain score experienced during the infusion was 3.7 (CI: 3.3-4.1), and during surgery, the score was 1.9 (CI: 1.4-2.3). Sixty-three (76%) of the patients were discharged directly from the operating room and 90% in less than an hour after the last stitch. The maximum pain after 2 days was none or mild (pain score ≤3) in 80% of the patients. Work could be resumed the next day by 35%, and after 4 days by 87% of the patients with a mean time of 3.0 (CI: 2.2-3.7) days. LIMITATIONS This study might be limited by its noncomparative design. CONCLUSION Most patients with moderate to complex pilonidal sinuses can be treated under local anesthesia without notable pain, and discharged minutes after the operation. The Bascom cleft-lift procedure causes only mild postoperative pain, and patients can resume work a few days later.","Bertelsen, Claus Anders",Diseases of the colon and rectum,183,31

In light of this fact, some modern researchers are calling for replication of earlier landmark trials with women only. This approach is ethically concerning, in that it would require some enrolled women to be deprived of treatments that are currently considered standard of care. OBJECTIVE In an attempt to better understand the justification of a women-only approach to designing clinical trials, this study looks to systematically categorise the number of women-only RCTs for conditions that affect both men and women and the reasons given within the medical and philosophical literatures to perform them. METHODOLOGY This scoping review of the literature will search, screen and select articles based on predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria, after which a grounded theory approach will be used to synthesise the data. It is expected that there will be a variety of reasons given for why a women-only trial may be justified.

To appreciate how well observational and functional endpoints are likely to predict an increased risk of infection in humans, it is important to establish correlations between alterations in human immune function and an increased risk of disease. This review will address the clinical evidence for increased risk of disease in humans with mild to moderate levels of immunosuppression using examples from the literature, discuss specific immune system defects associated with increased rates of infection, and examine factors that impact the interpretation of clinical data. The most comprehensive data bases that address these relationships, those derived from patients with primary immunodeficiency and AIDS, are not discussed in this review.

This syndrome is characterised by recurrent episodes of hypoglycaemia and elevated ammonia levels, which are potentially harmful to both the patient and a developing fetus. We describe a successful multidisciplinary approach during the pregnancy of a mentally challenged patient with HI/HA syndrome. This case illustrates the importance of personalised counselling during the preconception period and emphasises to include all disciplines involved in the medical and daily care of such a patient. In our case, the extensive multidisciplinary care during the preconception period, pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period resulted in a good maternal and neonatal outcome.","Benner, Bernadette J M; Bazelmans, Mijke; Huidekoper, Hidde; Langeveld, Mirjam; Langendonk, Janneke; Schoenmakers, Sam",BMJ case reports,183,1

The annual PCB inputs were similar, and the glacial runoff and sediment-to-water exchange were negligible sources of PCBs to the water column relative to atmospheric deposition. The annual inputs were primarily introduced by snow deposition and transferred into the lakes during the few weeks of spring thaw. While the dominant deposition pathways were similar, the main processes by which the water column lost pollutants differed between the two lakes. Despite these differences, the mass budget revealed that PCB inputs exceeded outputs for both studied lakes and that the lakes acted as atmospheric PCB sinks for the surrounding mountain environment. The differences in the PCB distribution between the key compartments (sediment and water column) are most likely due to differences in the lacustrine internal processes.","Nellier, Yann-Michel; Perga, Marie-Elodie; Cottin, Nathalie; Fanget, Philippe; Malet, Emmanuel; Naffrechoux, Emmanuel",The Science of the total environment,183,28

DESIGN A survey consisting of closed-set and open-ended questions that assessed working practices during the COVID-19 restrictions and audiologists' attitudes towards teleaudiology. SAMPLE About 120 audiologists in the UK recruited via snowball sampling through social media and emails. RESULTS About 30% of respondents said they had used teleaudiology prior to COVID-19 restrictions; 98% had done at the time of survey completion, and 86% said they would continue to do so even when restrictions are lifted. Reasons for prior non-use of teleaudiology were associated with clinical limitations/needs, available infrastructure and patient preferences. Respondents believe teleaudiology will improve travel, convenience, flexibility and scheduling, that it will have little/no impact on satisfaction and quality of care, but that it will negatively impact personal interactions. Concerns about teleaudiology focussed on communication, inability to conduct some clinical procedures and technology. CONCLUSIONS Respondents' experience with teleaudiology has generally been positive however improvements to infrastructure and training are necessary, and because many procedures must be conducted in-person, it will always be necessary to have hybrid-care pathways available.","Saunders, Gabrielle H; Roughley, Amber",International journal of audiology,183,16

OBJECTIVE To assess the diagnostic accuracy of dermatoscopy plus confocal microscopy for melanoma diagnosis of dark pigmented lesions in real life. METHODS Prospective analysis of difficult dark lesions with clinical-dermatoscopic suspicion of melanoma referred to RCM for further analysis. Outcome of lesions could be: excision or dermatoscopic digital follow up. RESULTS We included 370 clinically dark lesions from 350 patients (median age, 45 years). Due to the clinical-dermatoscopic-RCM approach, we saved 129/213 unnecessary biopsies (specificity of 60.6%) with a sensitivity of 98.1% (154/157). Number needed to excise with the addition of RCM was 1.5 for melanoma diagnosis. LIMITATIONS Single institution based; Italian population only. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that RCM coupled with dermatoscopy increase the specificity for diagnosing melanoma and it helps to correctly identify benign lesions. Our findings provide the basis for subsequent prospective studies on melanocytic neoplasms belonging to patients in different countries.","Longo, Caterina; Mazzeo, Mauro; Raucci, Margherita; Cornacchia, Luigi; Lai, Michela; Bianchi, Luca; Peris, Ketty; Pampena, Riccardo; Pellacani, Giovanni",Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,183,28

Degradation through autophagy can provide an innate defence against virus infection, or conversely autophagosomes can promote infection by facilitating assembly of replicase proteins. We demonstrate that the avian coronavirus, Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) activates autophagy. A screen of individual IBV non-structural proteins (nsps) showed that autophagy was activated by IBV nsp6. This property was shared with nsp6 of mammalian coronaviruses Mouse Hepatitis Virus, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus, and the equivalent nsp5-7 of the arterivirus Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus. These multiple-spanning transmembrane proteins located to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they generated Atg5 and LC3II-positive vesicles, and vesicle formation was dependent on Atg5 and class III PI3 kinase. The vesicles recruited double FYVE-domain containing protein (DFCP) indicating localised concentration of phosphatidylinositol 3 phosphate, and therefore shared many features with omegasomes formed from the ER in response to starvation. Omegasomes induced by viral nsp6 matured into autophagosomes that delivered LC3 to lysosomes and therefore recruited and recycled the proteins needed for autophagosome nucleation, expansion, cellular trafficking and delivery of cargo to lysosomes. The coronavirus nsp6 proteins activated omegasome and autophagosome formation independently of starvation, but activation did not involve direct inhibition of mTOR signalling, activation of sirtuin1 or induction of ER stress.","Cottam, Eleanor M; Maier, Helena J; Manifava, Maria; Vaux, Laura C; Chandra-Schoenfelder, Priya; Gerner, Wilhelm; Britton, Paul; Ktistakis, Nick T; Wileman, Tom",Autophagy,183,28

However, evidence on the benefits of prehospital ALS for patients with trauma is controversial. Therefore, we aim to clarify if ALS improves mortality in patients with trauma when compared with BLS by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of the recent literature. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will perform searches in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for published observational studies, controlled before-and-after studies, randomised controlled trials and other controlled trials conducted in humans and published until March 2017. We will screen search results, assess study selection, extract data and assess the risk of bias in duplicate; disagreements will be resolved through discussions. Data from clinically homogeneous studies will be pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis, heterogeneity of effects will be assessed using the χ2 test of homogeneity, and any observed heterogeneity will be quantified using the I2 statistic. Last, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach will be used to rate the quality of the evidence.

Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of cervical cancer patients who underwent radical surgery and be reported PNI from January 2012 to June 2017 at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. After 1 : 1 propensity score matching (PSM), a group of patients without PNI was matched according to the clinical pathological features. Postoperative pathological parameters and prognosis were evaluated between the PNI and the matched groups. Results 1836 patients were screened, of which 162 (8.8%) diagnosed as stages IB1 to IIB reported PNI. Comparing to the matched group, more PNI (+) patients had deep outer cervix stromal invasion, cervical tunica adventitia invasion, positive lymph nodes, and positive margins. Among patients without high-risk factors, PNI (+) patients had worse 3-year overall survival (90.8% vs. 98.1%, P = 0.02), PNI (+) patients with single intermediate-risk factor and PNI (-) patients who meet with SEDLIS criteria had similar progress free survival (P = 0.63) and overall survival (P = 0.63), even similar survival curves.

It is anticipated that infection will be no less common in xenotransplantation recipients. Prolonged xenograft survivals have resulted from advances in immunosuppressive strategies and development of swine that decrease host immune responses via genetic manipulation, notably CRISPR/cas9 manipulation. As prospects for clinical trials improve, consideration of the unique infectious risks posed by xenotransplantation reemerge. RECENT FINDINGS Organisms likely to cause infection in human recipients of porcine xenografts are unknown in advance of clinical trials. Microbiological screening of swine intended as xenograft donors can be more intensive than is currently feasible for human allograft donors. Monitoring infection in recipients will also be more intensive. Key opportunities in infectious diseases of xenotransplantation include major technological advances in evaluation of the microbiome by unbiased metagenomic sequencing, assessments of some risks posed by porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) including antiretroviral susceptibilities, availability of swine with deletion of genomic PERVs, and recognition of the rapidly changing epidemiology of infection in swine worldwide. SUMMARY Unknown infectious risks in xenotransplantation requires application of advanced microbiological techniques to discern and prevent infection in graft recipients. Clinical trials will provide an opportunity to advance the safety of all of organ transplantation.","Fishman, Jay A",Current opinion in organ transplantation,183,1

Vaccination rollout is frequently supplemented with advisory from public health authorities for continuation of physical distancing measures. Compliance with these measures is waning while more transmissible virus variants such as Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2) have emerged. In this work, we considered a population where the waning of compliance depends on vaccine coverage. We used a SARS-CoV-2 transmission model which captures the feedback between compliance, infection incidence, and vaccination coverage to investigate factors that contribute to the increase of the prevalence of infection during the initial stages of the vaccination rollout as compared to no vaccination scenario. We analysed how the vaccine uptake rate affects cumulative numbers of new infections three and six months after the start of vaccination. Our results suggest that the combination of fast waning compliance in non-vaccinated population, low compliance in vaccinated population and more transmissible virus variants may result in a higher cumulative number of new infections than in a situation without vaccination. These adverse effects can be alleviated if vaccinated individuals do not revert to pre-pandemic contact rates, and if non-vaccinated individuals remain compliant with physical distancing measures. Both require convincing, clear and appropriately targeted communication strategies by public health authorities.","Teslya, A.; Rozhnova, G.; Pham, T. M.; van Wees, D. A.; Nunner, H.; Godijk, N.

These bacteria rely on specific transporters for the acquisition of host-derived sialic acids. Here, we present the first comprehensive genomic and phylogenetic analysis of bacterial sialic acid transporters, leading to the identification of multiple new families and subfamilies. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that sialic acid-specific transport has evolved independently at least 8 times during the evolution of bacteria, from within 4 of the major families/superfamilies of bacterial transporters, and we propose a robust classification scheme to bring together a myriad of different nomenclatures that exist to date. The new transporters discovered occur in diverse bacteria including Spirochaetes, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia, many of which are species that have not been previously recognised to have sialometabolic capacities. Two subfamilies of transporters stand out in being fused to the sialic acid mutarotase enzyme, NanM, and these transporter fusions are enriched in bacteria present in gut microbial communities. We also provide evidence for a possible function of a sialic acid transporter component in chemotaxis that is independent of transport. Our analysis supports the increasing experimental evidence that competition for host-derived sialic acid is a key phenotype for successful colonisation of complex mucosal microbiomes, such that a strong evolutionary selection has occurred for the emergence of sialic acid specificity within existing transporter architectures.","Severi, Emmanuele; Rudden, Michelle; Bell, Andrew; Palmer, Tracy; Juge, Nathalie; Thomas, Gavin H",bioRxiv,183,16

We use insights from the entrepreneurship, development, and institutions literature to develop a model of entrepreneurship activity in the aftermath of natural disasters. First, we hypothesize the effect of natural disasters on entrepreneurship activity depends on the amount of foreign aid received. Second, we hypothesize that natural disasters and foreign aid either encourages or discourages entrepreneurship activity depending on two important institutional conditions: the quality of government and economic freedom. The findings from our panel of 85 countries from 2006 to 2016 indicate that natural disasters are negatively associated with entrepreneurship activity, but both foreign aid and economic freedom attenuate this effect. In addition, we observe that foreign aid is positively associated with entrepreneurship activity but only in countries with high quality government. Hence, we conclude that the effect of natural disasters on entrepreneurship depends crucially on the quality of government, economic freedom, and foreign aid. Our findings provide new insights into how natural disasters and foreign aid affect entrepreneurship and highlight the important role of the institutional context.","Boudreaux, Christopher; Jha, Anand; Escaleras, Monica",,183,1

Tailoring MH interventions and psychosocial support to the context and culture is essential for ensuring safe and competent services. A complex political context (CPC) is characterised by complex political dynamics, social instability and political violence resulting in gross violation of human rights and massive trauma. Examples of such settings include dictatorships, military junta and other forms of government-sponsored, sectarian or ethnic violence towards marginalised groups who are targeted, oppressed and discriminated. In some countries, receiving MH services can expose beneficiaries and put them at risk. Scaling up MH support is needed when serving persons with special needs and those at particular risk for discrimination and victimisation. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has worsened the situation and been used by unscrupulous politicians to tighten governmental control, blame already marginalised groups and deny or further limit their access to resources and health care. These guidelines aim to equip MH workers with an understanding of the professional challenges and ethical dilemmas posed by CPCs. They offer recommendations for programming and delivering MH services in CPC. Providing MH interventions in a CPC calls for special professional expertise, extensive use of supervision and peer support, and personal competencies such as self-awareness and self-care.","Cherepanov, Elena",Intervention,183,7

Since the mode of transmission is close contact, especially the educational environments that require collective presence have been accepted as the most risky places and the first measures have been taken in these areas. In this context, distance education was started by YÖK in all universities. Unlike previous distance education, both students and faculty faced many negativities due to various reasons during the epidemic period. In this study, it was aimed to develop a valid and reliable scale to measure the attitudes of Sivas Cumhuriyet University students towards distance education applied during the epidemic period. For this purpose, a draft scale consisting of 35 items was created in the first stage. As a result of EFA applied to the draft scale, a 21-item scale consisting of five factors was obtained. The fit of the model was tested with confirmatory factor analysis, and fit indices were found in the acceptance range. Test-retest results and item analysis based on lower and upper groups were obtained significantly. In addition, the Cronbach Alpha value of the scale was calculated as 0.884, and the Cronbach Alpha value of the sub-factors between 0.884-0.658.","Arslan, Rahim",Kafkas University.

This can impact the entire admission increasing morbidity and mortality for what is a treatable problem. The aim therefore was to assess how prevalent constipation was across the inpatient population;analyse if there were any common themes and implement interventions that might help solve these. Method: Data was collected over 15 days across the department (up to 87 patients) using nursing handover sheets to review the date bowels had last been opened. Patients were classified as constipated if they had not opened their bowels for more than 3 days. On two days common themes in the constipated patients were reviewed and analysed. On average 27% of patients were constipated. The majority of these had been deemed 'Medically Ready for Discharge'. They all had either no or only a reduced range of aperients prescribed. Stakeholders including patients, nursing staff, prescribers and Consultants were surveyed. First cycle intervention was to highlight those constipated at morning Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) meetings to prompt medical review. Second cycle intervention: an e-prescribing bundle was designed to allow for simple prescription and for nurses to give aperients on an as required basis. A laxative prescribing guide sheet was also written to aid prescribers. Results: Aim is to reduce constipation to less than 20% thereby reducing morbidity and mortality in inpatients. Highlighting patients atMDThad little effect partly as it was person dependent. Effect of prescribing bundle yet to be determined but received positively by stakeholders. Prescribing guide received positively by Consultants and junior prescribers. Conclusions: Person dependent intervention was ineffective at reducing constipation highlighted by staff sickness due to Covid-19. A prescribing bundle is more system based. If used at admission hopefully will be effective and sustainable.","Rollo-Walker, J. C. R. G.",Age and Ageing,183,24

In this paper, we present an indoor navigation system based on a combination of wall-mounted wireless sensors, a mobile health application (mHealth app), and WiFi/Bluetooth beacons. Such a system can be used to track and trace people with neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, throughout the hospital complex. The Contact tracing is accomplished by using Bluetooth low-energy beacons to detect and monitor the possibilities of those who have been exposed to communicable diseases such as COVID-19. The communication flow between the mHealth app and the cloud-based framework is explained elaborately in the paper. The system provides a real-time remote monitoring system for primary medical care in cases where relatives of Alzheimer’s patients and doctors are having complications that may demand medical care or hospitalization. The proposed indoor navigation system has been found to be useful in assisting patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) while in the hospital building. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Biswas, M.; Rahman, A.; Kaiser, M.

Further, COVID-19 has served as a sobering reminder of the significant public health disparities in our society and it is critical to identify risk factors for poorer clinical outcomes. The primary objectives of the present study were to: (a) determine whether parents are reporting higher levels of pandemic-related stress, PTSS, and adjustment disorder than controls, (b) identify specific individual-level factors (e.g., age, gender, race, number of children, age of children) that may be related to higher levels of stress and symptoms among parents, and (c) report parents' utilization of, and perceived efficacy of, psychological interventions during COVID-19. A U.S. nationally representative sample (N = 2,019) from Qualtrics Data panels was recruited in July-August 2020. Parents endorsed higher levels of stress, PTSS, and adjustment disorder, particularly younger parents. Further, 38.3% of parents reported PTSS above clinical cutoff. Younger participants and persons of color reported higher levels of pandemic-related stress. One-third of parents (33.1%) reported using online mental health services. Taken together, parents may be at greater risk for pandemic stress, PTSS, and adjustment disorder symptoms. Individual-level risk factors, such as age and minority status, are important to consider when understanding COVID-19 stress. Clinical intervention efforts should prioritize trauma-focused treatments for parents, especially those who are younger and identify as a person of color.

As Echocardiography is not available in primary care, the key structural (heart chamber enlargements) and functional abnormality related measurements are not available precluding the ability to diagnose HF other than through mainly symptomatic means. The opportunity for earlier detection of HF is lost. In this work, we first explore each of the three HF categories, preserved EF, mild-reduced EF, and reduced EF, using various morphological and functional etiology-specific characteristics supported by a literature review and an extensive analysis of a large, dedicated database accumulated over 8 years. We then explore the typical signs and co-morbidities of HF using prevalence analysis to unravel the diagnostic makeup of each HF category as characteristically derived by ECG- and ECHO-findings. From this, we then conduct a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data to interpret patterns of comorbidities, showing groups of comorbidities frequently associated with each other. Lastly, we delve into the role of breakthrough methods for the analysis of bio-signals to replicate common ECHO-findings, as alternatives for detecting and diagnosing HF similarly to Echocardiography, thereby providing a simple device for the effective detection of HF for use in Primary Care.","Zaman, A.; Calcagno, S.; Zoccai, G.

The combinatorics of international travel services realization is based on the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. The novelty of the methodology consists in the transformation of services at the time of the introduction or removal of coronavirus-bound pandemic restrictions. At the same time, the distribution of risks on the range of modified tourist services, namely the risks from possible termination of tourist travel, as well as those from a non-disposal of the offered tourist products, is achieved. The combination of the tourist services disposal at different stages of the trip in the form of a directed graph of tourist services as a part of a tourist product is presented. The main incentive for the implementation of the offered methodology is to maintain the income of manufacturers and suppliers of tourism services and to satisfy consumers by expanding possible offers. The use of combinatorics of the offered services in the state space, their implementation at different moments of iterations, their application with the synchronization of the financial flows throughput allows to reduce risks in the tourist product acquisition and its further disposal. The value of the work lies in reducing the risks of international tourism in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and preserving the income of manufacturers and suppliers of tourism services. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Sharko, M.; Fomishyna, V.; Liubchuk, O.; Petrushenko, N.; Yakymchuk, T.; Chaika-Petehyrych, L.",Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies,183,1

Our research team has investigated how wearable IoT devices can alleviate this problem by utilizing 802.11 wireless beacon frames broadcasted from pre-existing access points in a building to achieve room-level localization. Notable improvements to this low-cost localization technique's accuracy are achieved via machine learning by implementing the random forest algorithm. Using random forest, historical data can train the model and make more informed decisions while tracking other nodes in the future. In this project, employees' and patients' locations while in a building (e.g., a healthcare facility) can be time-stamped and stored in a database. With this data available, contact tracing can be automated and accurately conducted, allowing those who have been in contact with a confirmed positive COVID-19 case to be notified and quarantined immediately.

In the current study, grab sampling of primary influent was performed every 2 h over two 24-h periods at two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in northern Indiana, USA. The recovery efficiency of endogenous SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was confirmed to be similar to the recovery efficiency of the process control, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV). Recovery-corrected SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in primary influent indicate diurnal loading patterns and confirm monitoring dependent on grab samples should target daytime periods with high fecal loading. Importantly, manual compositing performed at the WWTP resulted in concentrations that were consistently lower than grab sample averages indicating potential bias. Uncorrected, recovery-corrected, and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV)-normalized SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations demonstrated an ordinal agreement with increasing clinical COVID-19 positivity but not COVID-19 cases. In areas where geolocated COVID-19 case data are not available, the COVID-19 positivity rate could provide a useful county-level metric for comparison with wastewater.

It had many physical but also psychological repercussions. It led to the onset of general stress, anxiety and depression affecting different age groups. In this study, we report the frequency of anxiety in patients followed in the department of rheumatology during the COVID-19 outbreak. Objectives: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in patients followed for inflammatory rheumatic disorders (IRD) or degenerative diseases in the Department of Rheumatology during the period of breakdown and health restrictions. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in the department of rheumatology over a 5-month period from August 2020 to December 2020. Included patients were followed for IRD or degenerative pathology in the department. A pre-established questionnaire collected the symptoms and results of COVID-19 tests, the possible deterioration of the general condition since breakdown, as well as the increase of the disease activity of the rheumatism, pain, fatigue, anxiety, and the onset of signs of depression or sleep disturbances.The impact of the decrease in physical activity and the cessation of basic treatments of rheumatism with the different causes was also collected. Results: 159 patients were included: 27 with Rheumatoid arthritis, 58 with Spondyloarthropathies, 32 with chondrocalcinosis, 9 with gouty arthropathies, and 33 with osteoarthritis. Of these, 15% had symptoms consistent with COVID-19. 25 patients performed the PCR test, of which 17 were positive and only 3 required hospitalization.None were put on oxygen. 32% reported a worsening of their rheumatism since the beginning of the epidemic, of which 35.9% reported increased pain and 21 noted a decrease in physical activity. 27.1% felt more stressed and irritated, and 14% felt more depressed. 54% had more sleepdisturbance, 22.2% had more fatigue compared to their state before the epidemic. 41.2% were afraid to come for consultation or hospitalization. 11.8% had stopped the basic treatment of their rheumatism, either for a shortage of the product in the pharmacy, or for the inability to obtain a travel authorization from the authorities Conclusion: The physical and mental impact of the COVID-19pandemic affected approximately one-third of our population. Patients described worsening rheumatism and pain, as well as impaired sleep, fatigue and anxiety[1].Decreased physical activity was associated with increased rheumatism activity and pain. More than 50% of the patients presented a deterioration in their physical and mental health linked to the health situation[2]. Our results are consistent with the literature. It is classically admitted that rheumatic pathologiesare disabling and therefore lead to a withdrawal into oneself, generating an anxious state. It is essential to assess the psychological status of patients followed for rheumatism in order to develop preventive treatments and prevent its worsening linked to the impact of the pandemic[3].","Lahrichi, S.; Nassar, K.; Janani, S.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,183,26

COVID-19 vaccine has been considered by many specialists as the best strategy to face the pandemic. Developing a safe and effective vaccine to combat COVID-19 in a timely manner is as daunting as scaling-up manufacturing to produce billions of doses. To accomplish such a goal, pharmaceutical companies have to prepare themselves in terms of infrastructure to ramp-up production as quickly as possible. One potential alternative to do that is to build a network of manufacturing partners. We consider the question of how to speed up technology transfer to ramp-up production under time pressure.

Currently, more than 210 countries are suffering from COVID-19 with the number of affected countries and patients are exponentially increasing day by day. It became a global health issue where more than 2.7 million cases were reported with a death ratio of approximate 7% globally by World Health Organization (WHO) (as of 24 April 2020) which is a 22 times higher numbers in 1.5 month and this figure increasing day by day at an alarming rate. The maximum infected cases reported from the most developed country and the world leader America however, the maximum death cases are from the world’s second health service provider country Italy. China, the origin country of COVID-19, has taken serious actions in terms of prevention, control against the spreading of this coronavirus through lockdown, sanitation, medication, and social distancing. The risk of transmissions of coronavirus from humans to humans is more and thus a social distancing is the best way for its persistence and precautions. Thus, the COVID-19 outbreak continues must explore and evolve, certain strict and mandatory precautions to stop this dangerous devil virus.

Detailed evolution of the localized velocities, shear stresses, plastic strains, and temperature state in the vicinity of the weld interface during its formation are revealed. The presented simulation technique applies a load distribution that is temporally and spatially modeled based on the plasma pressure induced during surface ablation by a nanosecond-pulsed infrared laser. Due to the Gaussian plasma-pressure loading profile, significant shear stress patterns are observed to develop in the flyer foil prior to its collision with the target foil, the character of which appears to be significant in achieving a successful impact weld. Moreover, features already known to be critical to successful impact welding of thin foils are captured by the combination of the high-fidelity Eulerian control volume and the plasma pressure model, including the requisite collision velocity and impact angle. During the impact welding, interfacial material ‘jetting’ is observed, in addition to concentrated shear stress fields along the weld front. A wavy interface arising from a regular pattern of material mixing is confirmed to occur, in addition to significant plastic strains and heat generation due to the plastic deformation, all of which indicate the formation of a collision joint due to the more realistic loading condition imposed.","Gleason, Glenn; Sunny, Sumair; Sadeh, Sepehr; Yu, Haoliang; Malik, Arif",Procedia Manufacturing,183,1

Immune-mediated diseases (IMID), as inflammatory arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have some special implications due to their pathogenesis and treatments. Some treatments employed in IMID are now being used in the treatment of severe COVID-19. There still exists controversy about IMID behavior and its complications. 1, 2 Objectives: To assess COVID-19 severity in IMID patients and its prognosis predictors. Methods: An observational retrospective multicenter study was performed in two Spanish Hospitals (Clinical University Hospital in Santiago De Compostela and Gregorio Marañón Hospital). Patients were selected if they were diagnosed of an IMID (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, espondyloarthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) and had COVID-19 infection between February and April 2020. Demographic, clinical, analytical and treatment data were collected. Logistic regression was used to evaluate potential predictors. Stata 15.1 was used to perform statistical analysis. Results: 91 patients were recruited. 55 suffered from a rheumatic disease and 36 suffer IBD. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Univariable analysis reached age, comorbidity, female gender, flu vaccine, arthropathy, basal classical synthetic anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARD), pneumonia and basal C-reactive protein (CRP) as potential predictors of non-severe (absence of death, respiratory insufficiency, intensive care unit admission or sepsis) COVID-19 disease (p < 0.2). After multivariable analysis, only female gender (OR 4.60 [CI95% 1.00, 21.2] p=0.050), lower age (OR 0.94 [CI95% 0.88, 1.00] p=0.042) and lower basal levels of CRP (OR 0.87 [CI95% 0.77, 0.97] p=0.010) were predictors for non-severe disease (p < 0.005). Mean time of healing (symptoms solved in outpatient and hospital discharge in admitted) from COVID-19 was 13.8 days (SD 16.3). Univariable analysis showed arthropathy, COVID-19 symptomatic and basal glucocorticoids (GC) dose as potential predictors of higher time-to-healing from COVID-19 disease (p < 0.2). After multivariable analysis, only lower GC basal dose predicts higher time-tohealing (OR -1.83 [CI95% -2.81, -0.84] p=0.001). 11 patients deceased because of COVID-19. Univariable analysis reached age, basal csDMARD, pneumonia and basal CRP as potential predictors of COVID-19 mortality (p < 0.2). After multivariable analysis, only higher age was a predictor for mortality (OR 1.14 [CI95% 1.04,1.25] p=0.006). Conclusion: IMID patients showed similar predictors of mortality than general population involving COVID-19. Immune-modulating agents did not seem to overshadow the prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Female gender, lower age and lower basal CRP could select a cohort of “good” prognosis patients with mild COVID-19 disease as well higher age points out the worst prognosis. Even that, each case should be individiualized.","Dos-Santos, R.; Calviño, C.; Bastón, I.; Ferreiro, R.; Montero, F.; Gonzalez, C.; Marín-Jiménez, I.; Barreiro-de-Acosta, M.; Perez-Pampín, E.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,183,1

It is highly emerging with efficient biosensors such as sensitive and selective that afford the diagnostic tools to infer the disease early. It can maintain a personalized healthcare system to evaluate the growth of disease under proper patient care. To discover as a personalized technology, the healthcare system prefers collaborative filtering. It can effectively deal with cold-start and sparse-data to conduct useful extensions. Due to the continuous expansion of scaling data in a medical scenario, content-based, collaborative filtering, and similarity metrics are preferred. It relies on the most similar social users or threats when the information is large. Many neighbors gain importance to obtain a set of users with whom a target user is likely to match. Forming communities reveal vulnerable users and also reduce the challenges of collaborative filtering like data-sparsity and cold-start problems. Thus, this framework proposes content-based collaborative filtering using intelligent recommendation systems (CCF-IRS) based on high correlation and shortest neighbor in the social community. The result is shown that the proposed CCF-IRS achieves better accuracy than the existing algorithms. © 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Deebak, B.

Prior research has demonstrated that exercise, while not a cure, can help mitigate sarcopenia/frailty and restore functional capacity. Reliable, validated, pre-clinical models are necessary to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms at the intersection of age, exercise, and functional decline. In this study, we hypothesized that endurance exercise programs mimicking typical human exercise protocols would improve physical function in both adult and older adult mice. Furthermore, our secondary hypothesis was that older mice would receive less benefit from a similar volume of exercise than adult mice. To test these hypotheses, we randomly assigned (with some selection criteria) male C57BL/6 mice either at adult ages during the study (n=24, designated 10m, aged 6 months to 10 months) or at older adult ages (n=18, designated 26m, aged 22 months to 26 months) to a 13-week program of voluntary wheel running (VWR, group termed RUN) or high intensity interval training (HIIT), with an additional 10m sedentary control (CON).

The development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 is difficult due to many obstacles, such as the lack of knowledge of important proteins, genes, and mutations of the viral genome. In this study, we selected and utilized 852 strains of COVID-19 from major countries in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) global virus bank. The information of these strains was processed by using Nextstrain software, a program that provided a visual phylogenetic tree, transmission map, and diversity panel that explains entropy and number of mutations for each codon in the genome. The general data about the spread and evolution of COVID-19 supported the current knowledge that it began in China and spread throughout the country in an interrelated manner instead of a clear ""patient zero"" manner. A recent study reported that codon 614 on COVID-19 spike protein (S614) was an important codon for viral spread, specifically, a mutation from aspartic acid to glycine facilitated the spread of the virus. Therefore, we chose to geographically track this mutation during the spread of COVID-19 to investigate where it emerged and whether it can affect the spread COVID-19. Our results showed that the glycine mutation first emerged in France. Also, the transmission rates in France versus China, where the mutation was not prevalent, did reflect the hypothesized change in viral behavior.","Li, M. J.; Prasad, N.; Hall, D.; Wu, H.

In this regard, the recent SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant, B.1.1.7 lineage, reported from the United Kingdom (UK), is of great significance in that it contains several mutations that increase its infection and transmission rates as evident from clinical reports. Specifically, the N501Y mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) has been shown to possess an increased affinity for ACE2, although the basis for this is not entirely clear yet. Here, we dissect the mechanism underlying the increased affinity using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the available ACE2-S1-RBD complex structure (6M0J) and show a prolonged and stable interfacial interaction of the N501Y mutant S1-RBD with ACE2 compared to the wild type S1-RBD. Additionally, we find that the N501Y mutant S1-RBD displays altered dynamics that likely aids in its enhanced interaction with ACE2. By elucidating a mechanistic basis for the increased affinity of the N501Y mutant S1-RBD for ACE2, we believe that the results presented here will aid in developing therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 including designing drugs targeting the ACE2-S1-RBD interaction. Significance The emergence of the new SARS-CoV-2 lineage in the UK in December 2020 has further aggravated the COVID-19 pandemic due to an increased ability of the variant to infect human hosts, likely due to mutations in the viral S1 spike protein including the N501Y S1-RBD mutation that is located at the interface of S1-RBD and ACE2, the host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Given its location at the interface, N501Y S1-RBD mutation can therefore potentially alter the interfacial interaction. Multiple, all-atom, explicit solvent MD simulations of the ACE2-S1-RBD complex carried here indicated a more stable interaction between the N501Y mutant S1-RBD and ACE2 through stabilizing interfacial interactions of residues at one end of the interface that are either sequentially or physically near the mutation site. These mechanistic details will aid in better understanding the mechanism by which the alpha variant has increased infectivity as well as in designing better therapeutics including ACE2-S1 spike protein inhibitors that will, in turn, help thwarting the current and future pandemic. Highlights N501 in the wild type SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD forms unsustained hydrogen bonds with residues in the ACE2, namely Y41 and K353 Y501 in the N501Y mutant SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD is not capable of forming substantial hydrogen bonds with ACE2 within the time span of the current simulation Evidence from analyzing the simulation results suggests that Y501 of S1-RBD could form other types of non-covalent interactions with ACE2, such as van der Waals interactions N501Y S1-RBD mutation stabilizes the position of interfacial residues neighboring to the mutation site, as well as other non-interfacial residues that are distant from the mutation site These altered dynamics results in more stable interaction of S1-RBD with ACE2 which could be the main reason underlying the reported enhanced affinity of S1-RBD in the SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant (UK B.1.1.7 lineage) to ACE2","Ahmed, Wesam S; Philip, Angelin M; Biswas, Kabir H",bioRxiv,183,16

Meanwhile, we design a multitask model called NewsEmbed that alternatively trains a contrastive learning with a multi-label classification to derive a universal document encoder.

This framework employs three binaries for analyzing state control: territoriality (internal/external controls);nationality (citizens/aliens);and directionality (entry/exit). Ultimately, governmental responses to Covid-19 highlight both the independence and interdependence of states in a globalized world. The widespread closure of borders to outsiders and insiders demonstrates that classical Westphalian notions of the nation and state borders persist, even while being transformed by ever-more-innovative technologies.

We describe trends in risk of mortality among care home residents compared to residents in private homes in England. Methods: On behalf of NHS England, we used OpenSAFELY-TPP, an analytics platform running across the linked electronic health records of approximately a third of the English population, to calculate monthly age-standardised risks of death due to all causes and COVID-19 among adults aged >=65 years between 1/2/2019 and 31/03/2021. Care home residents were identified using linkage to the Care and Quality Commission. Findings: We included 4,329,078 people aged 65 years or older on the 1st of February 2019, 2.2% of whom were classified as residing in a care or nursing home. Age-standardised mortality risks were approximately 10 times higher among care home residents compared to non-residents in February 2019 residents (CMF = 10.59, 95%CI = 9.51, 11.81 among women, CMF = 10.82, 95%CI = 9.89, 11.84 among men).

CMFs did not increase during the second wave, despite a rise in the absolute age-standardised COVID-19 mortality risks. Interpretation: The first COVID-19 wave had a disproportionate impact on care home residents in England compared to older private home residents. A degree of immunity, improved protective measures or changes in the underlying frailty of the populations may explain the lack of an increase in the relative mortality risks during the second wave. The care home population should be prioritised for measures aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19.","Schultze, A.; Nightingale, E.; Evans, D.; Hulme, W.

This study aimed to assess the association between the fear and knowledge of black fungus and other determinants among healthcare workers in Bangladesh. Methods: From 25th May 2021 to 5th June 2021, a cross-sectional study was carried out among healthcare workers. For data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic, a semi-structured online questionnaire was used followed by convenient and snowball sampling methods. A multivariable linear regression model was fitted to assess the association between the fear and knowledge of black fungus and other determinants. Results: A total of 422 healthcare workers participated in this study. The results indicated that with the increased knowledge score of black fungus, the average score of black fungus fear was significantly increased ({beta} = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.50, p <0.001). Alongside, the respondents having insomnia had a higher score of black fungus fear compare to not having insomnia ({beta} = 3.91, 95% CI: 2.49, 5.33, p <0.001) significantly. The gender, profession, and death due to COVID-19 of friends and family members had a significant effect on black fungus fear score increment. Conclusion: Even in the COVID-19 pandemic, the black fungus fear among healthcare workers may hinder their quality of life. Our study findings recommend an emphasis on the mental health aspects and ensure support to the healthcare workers so that they can tackle the ongoing situation with lesser frictions.

We investigated the effectiveness of the vaccines in a large community-based survey of randomly selected households across the UK. We found that the effectiveness of BNT162b2 and ChAd0x1 against any infections (new PCR positives) and infections with symptoms or high viral burden is reduced with the Delta variant. A single dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine had similar or greater effectiveness compared to a single dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1. Effectiveness of two doses remains at least as great as protection afforded by prior natural infection. The dynamics of immunity following second doses differed significantly between BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, with greater initial effectiveness against new PCR-positives but faster declines in protection against high viral burden and symptomatic infection with BNT162b2. There was no evidence that effectiveness varied by dosing interval, but protection was higher among those vaccinated following a prior infection and younger adults. With Delta, infections occurring following two vaccinations had similar peak viral burden to those in unvaccinated individuals. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination still reduces new infections, but effectiveness and attenuation of peak viral burden are reduced with Delta.","Pouwels, K. B.; Pritchard, E.; Matthews, P.; Stoesser, N.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between distress, risk perception, emotional representations, preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors, COVID-19 traumatic stress, posttraumatic growth, and psychological well-being, taking also into consideration sociodemographic variables as well as the moderator role of posttraumatic growth in the relationship between traumatic stress and psychological well-being. Material and methods: A cross-sectional design was used. Data were collected during the lockdown, in Portugal, from January to March 2021. The sample included 220 men who answered the questionnaires online. Results: Anxiety and depression symptoms (distress), traumatic stress, and emotional representations were negatively associated with psychological well-being. Older men, professionally active men, and men not in teleworking reported greater psychological well-being. The findings also showed that less emotional representations, less traumatic stress, and lower levels of distress contributed to greater psychological well-being. Finally, posttraumatic growth played a moderating role in the relationship between traumatic stress and psychological well-being. Conclusion: Interventions and further studies must consider the buffering role of posttraumatic growth during the COVID-19 pandemic and focus on helping men handle the associated traumatic stress in order to promote psychological well-being.","Santos, M.; Machado, A.

Given their colossal financing needs, which has been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, African countries need to put in place innovative financing mechanisms to support their development frameworks for building back better. The issuing of this type of bond could provide an opportunity for commodity-producing African countries to hedge against fluctuations in their export earnings. The results show that the value of a commodity-linked bond increases as the price of the commodity indexed to the bond rises, suggesting that African countries should issue debt contracts that are tied to their export commodities so that their debt declines with plummeting export prices (or export revenues). A simple portfolio rule derived suggests that countries should issue more commodity-linked bonds than conventional debt if the variance of the portfolio is greater than twice the spread between the expected total return of the conventional debt and the commodity-linked bond. This rule supports the view that African countries' debt-service payments, for debt issued in the form of commodity-linked bonds, would decline whenever the price of their export commodities decline thus lightening their debt load.","Atta-Mensah, J.",Quantitative Finance and Economics,183,16

Using the global COVID-19 data of 188 countries extracted from the Our World in Data between January 22, 2020--January 18, 2021, this study attempts to explore the potential determinants of the number of days to reach the first and second peak of COVID-19 cases for all 188 countries. Methods: A semi-parametric Cox proportional hazard (PH) model has been used to explore the covariates that are associated with the number of days to reach the first and second peak of global COVID-19 cases. Results: As of January 18, 2021, the first and second peak were found in 175 and 59 countries, out of 188 countries, respectively. The median number of days to hit the first peak was 60 days for countries which have median age above 40 while the median number of days to hit the second peak was 267 days for countries which have population density above 500 per square kilometer. Countries having population density between 250 and 500 were 2.25 times more likely to experience the first peak of COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 1.15-4.45, P<0.05) than countries which have population density below 25. Countries having population density between 100 and 250 were 67% less likely to get the second peak (95% CI: 0.119-0.908, P<0.05) compared to countries which have population density below 25. Countries having cardiovascular death rates above 350 were 2.94 times more likely to get the first peak (95% CI: 1.59-5.43, P<0.001). In contrast, countries having diabetes prevalence rate 3 to 12 were 85% less likely to experience the second peak of COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 0.036-0.680, P<0.05) than countries which have diabetes prevalence rate below 3. Besides, highly significant difference is found in the Kaplan-Meier plots of the number of days to reach both peaks across different categories of the country's Human Development Index. Conclusions: The number of days to the first peak was considerably small in Asian & European countries but that to the second peak in the countries where diabetes prevalence was very higher. Country's life expectancy had a significant effect on determining the first peak and so was the case for two other variables--the cardiovascular death rate and hospital beds per thousand. A contrast result was found for Human Development Index factor under the second peak. Additionally, it was found that the second peak was more likely to occur in more densely populated countries.","Oshan, Y. A.; Zainab, B.; Bandyopadhyay, D.; Rahaman Khan, H.",,183,8

These dynamic capabilities are operationalized differently by the two organizations, providing an interesting point of comparison. Nobody Denim focuses on employing migrant and refugee women and a 'Made in Australia' business model, while Outland Denim focuses on employing abused women and adopts an advocacy business model, making consumers aware about modern slavery and sustainability issues in the ready-made garment industry.

Three particular aspects of student experience of the decolonised curriculum and pedagogy are scrutinised. First, we look at the kind of sociality encouraged in the pedagogic encounter. Since a core function of education is social and cultural formation, a question arises as to what kind of sociality is possible between students and lecturers in a decolonised education space, including in the context of COVID-19. Second, we explore patterns of participation including, academic activities and support provided. Third, we investigate the knowledge forms and canon to which students are exposed in their respective programmes, with consideration of language issues. Finally, we examine the decolonisation of the curriculum in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Growing concerns about threats to students' mental health and decreased numbers of students transitioning to postsecondary education suggest access to school counselors is needed more than ever. Although previous research on school counselors finds they promote positive postsecondary, social emotional, and academic outcomes for students, further studies highlight the organizational constraints, such as an overemphasis on administrative duties and unclear role expectations, that hinder their work. Drawing on survey and focus group data, our mixed methods study documents school counselors' experiences during the COVID-19 crisis, including the opportunities and constraints facing their practice. Findings suggest there should be a concerted effort to reduce the role ambiguity and conflict in counselors' roles so they are better able to meet students' increased needs.","Savitz-Romer, M.; Rowan-Kenyon, H.

More precisely, we attempt to explain (a) how TL connects to employees’ turnover intentions, (b) how TL connects to employee performance, (c) how employee performance connects to turnover intentions, and (d) how employee performance mediates the connection between intentions and TL. Four hundred and seventy-eight Turkish healthcare professionals participated in this research. The results revealed that employee performance mediates the connection between turnover intentions and TL. In other words, transformational leaders encourage employee performance, which in turn decreases their turnover intentions. This research has important implications for reducing turnover in workplaces and increasing employee performance by facilitating a setting for high performance, since employees who are supported by their leaders are generally more committed to their organizations and exhibit better performance. This research answers calls to study the mediating function of the TL procedure, since the mediation clarifies the circumstances under which TL relates to the favorable results.","Yücel, Iacute; lhami,",Administrative Sciences,183,1

Behavior is driven by an individual’s character and the situation they are in, according to Character Computing and the Character-Behavior-Situation (CBS) triad. Accordingly, we developed the first full ontology modeling the CBS triad with the aim of providing domain experts with an intelligent interface for modeling, testing, and unifying hypotheses on the interactions between character, behavior, and situation. The ontology consists of a core module modeling character-based interactions and use-case and domain-specific modules. It was developed by computer scientists and psychology domain experts following an iterative process. The main contributions of this paper include updating the earlier prototypical version of the ontology-based on feedback from psychology experts and existing literature, adding more tools to it for enabling domain expert interaction, and providing the final ontology.

Unlike in previous observing runs in the advanced detector era, we include Virgo in the search for the GWB. The results are consistent with uncorrelated noise, and therefore we place upper limits on the strength of the GWB. We find that the dimensionless energy density $\Omega_{\rm GW}\leq 5.8\times 10^{-9}$ at the 95% credible level for a flat (frequency-independent) GWB, using a prior which is uniform in the log of the strength of the GWB, with 99% of the sensitivity coming from the band 20-76.6 Hz; $\leq 3.4 \times 10^{-9}$ at 25 Hz for a power-law GWB with a spectral index of 2/3 (consistent with expectations for compact binary coalescences), in the band 20-90.6 Hz; and $\leq 3.9 \times 10^{-10}$ at 25 Hz for a spectral index of 3, in the band 20-291.6 Hz. These upper limits improve over our previous results by a factor of 6.0 for a flat GWB. We also search for a GWB arising from scalar and vector modes, which are predicted by alternative theories of gravity; we place upper limits on the strength of GWBs with these polarizations. We demonstrate that there is no evidence of correlated noise of magnetic origin by performing a Bayesian analysis that allows for the presence of both a GWB and an effective magnetic background arising from geophysical Schumann resonances. We compare our upper limits to a fiducial model for the GWB from the merger of compact binaries. Finally, we combine our results with observations of individual mergers andshow that, at design sensitivity, this joint approach may yield stronger constraints on the merger rate of binary black holes at $z \lesssim 2$ than can be achieved with individually resolved mergers alone.

Through demographic changes in western countries and the COVID-19 pandemic, this relief is also considered for healthcare workers, especially caregivers, as the demands for them rises. The requirements are intuitively usable telerobotic and telepresence systems for remote assistance, to cut the high physical strain in manual patient transfers and the reduction of contact with infected patients. To ensure this, key technologies like 3D imaging and perception systems are essential. In this work, we present a novel, lightweight telepresence and telemanipulation system, specialized for caregiving. It allows an operator, wearing a virtual reality headset, to immerse into a sensor system captured scene on a distant location in real-time, with low latency of 250 ms and up to 30 fps refresh rate. Extensive measurement shows that 97.1% of the relevant point cloud data is below 1 cm error and 99.5 % is below 1.6 cm, making the system suitable for the application.","Fifelski-von Bohlen, C.; Brinkmann, A.; Mavers, S.; Hellmers, S.; Hein, A.; Soc, Ieee Comp",2020 Ieee International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality,183,16

While tourism generates economic growth and employment opportunities for residents, its benefits come with a social cost. This article high-lights the results of an online survey that was carried out at the beginning of 2021 in the seven major Galician cities along the Route of Santiago de Compostela (the Way of St. James) in Spain, which is a historical, natural, and cultural tourist attraction that is inscribed in the UNESCO’s World Heritage List in the category of cultural assets. The goal of the research work was to get to know first-hand the opinion of local communities about the positive and negative effects of tourism in their cities, on the Route of Santiago, and in the region of Galicia as a whole. Research work shows that residents’ perception of tourism leans toward the positive side, although it also reveals the need for tourism planners to involve host communities in tourism development. This research study about a World Heritage site should prove useful for political decision makers, tourism planners, and ex-perts, both in Galicia and elsewhere. © 2021 by the authors.

The fact that there is no expectation of reward in return for these behaviors enables the behaviors to occur voluntarily. Emotional intelligence and its elements are thought to have an important role in the emergence of these behaviors. Because the emotional intelligence state of the individual consists of the elements of understanding their own and others' emotions, being able to control their emotions, and benefiting from their emotions. Individuals who are capable of understanding the emotions of others, controlling their own emotions and benefiting from their emotions can be expected to exhibit prosocial behaviors in-role and beyond-role. In this context, our research was carried out with the participation of healthcare employees during extraordinary situations due to the COVID-19 epidemic. The sample of our study consists of a total of 209 doctors and nurses working in private health institutions in &Iacute;stanbul. In our study, personal information form, prosocial behavior and emotional intelligence scales were used to collect the information to be included in the analysis. As a result of our research, it was concluded that emotional intelligence and its elements have a significant effect on the emergence of prosocial behavior. In addition, emotional intelligence sub-factors were found to have a significant effect on the emergence of beyond-role prosocial behavior.","Sucu, Murat",Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart &amp;Uuml;niversitesi Yönetim Bilimleri Dergisi,183,25

The research reported in this article explored whether young adults’ compliance with an orally delivered recommendation to use hand sanitizer, an action thought to limit the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, would increase when the message was delivered in a low versus a high voice pitch. In an experiment involving 478 university students in Australia, a public health announcement delivered in a low voice pitch, compared with one delivered in a high voice pitch, increased participants’ sense of power, which increased their perceived behavioral control over their physical health and, in turn, increased their likelihood of using hand sanitizer. Because voice pitch is an aspect of health communications that can be modified easily at a low cost, the findings suggest a simple approach that public health and policy officials can adopt to improve hand hygiene in a population of people who spend a lot of time in close proximity and who should therefore practice hand hygiene routinely to protect themselves and others from infection. © 2021 Global Research Online.

Due to the difficult and time-consuming nature of following a cohort prospectively, life expectancy is often assessed based on death data, which may lead to potentially biased estimates. This is more likely to be a problem in rare diseases such as Morquio syndrome A. Method: To investigate how accurate the estimation of life expectancy is using death data, we simulate the survival of individuals with Morquio syndrome A under four different survival scenarios. In each scenario, we estimate the mean and median survival times within a defined period and compare them with the true life expectancy. Results: When life expectancy is constant during the entire period, using death data does not result in a biased estimate of life expectancy. However, when life expectancy increases during the follow-up period, using only death data leads to a substantial underestimation of life expectancy. Conclusion: Life expectancy can change over time, along with changes in the environment and/or biomedical innovation. When the life expectancy is increasing --- as is often expected to be the case in rare diseases --- estimating it based on contemporary death data will result in a downward bias. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how estimates of life expectancy are obtained and to interpret them in an appropriate context, and to assess estimation methods within a sensitivity analysis framework, similar to the simulations performed herein.","Yin, X.; Ahn, J.; Boca, S.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the change in nutrition and lifestyle habits of Turkish people during the COVID-19 outbreak and investigate the effects of individuals' attitudes to healthy eating on this change. METHOD: At the beginning of the pandemic, individuals over the age of 18 participated in this cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire. Demographic information (age, gender, education level, place of residence and occupation), anthropometric data (reported weight and height);nutritional behavior information (number of meals per day, changes in consumption of various foods, use of nutritional supplements, etc.) and changes in lifestyle habits were requested from the participations. In addition, the Healthy Nutrition Attitude Scale (ASHN) was used to determine the healthy eating attitudes of the participants. RESULTS: A total of 432 volunteers participated in the study. It was revealed that body weight increased in 38.0% of the participants and activity level decreased in 73.1% of them during the initial stage of the pandemic. Nevertheless, 44.7% of participants reported increased sleep time, 77.8% reported increased social media use, and 66.7% reported increased stress and anxiety. It was found that the most commonly used nutritional supplements during this period were vitamin C, vitamin D and multivitamin complex. Women have significantly higher ASHN scores compared to men (p < 0.001). The total ASHN scores of those whose body weight did not change and those who increased their activity level were found to be significantly higher. It was determined that as the age and education level increased, the healthy eating attitude increased. CONCLUSION: In this study, findings regarding the negative effects of the COVID-19 quarantine on the nutrition and lifestyle of the Turkish people are presented. However, those with a positive attitude toward healthy eating were observed to have better weight control and eating habits and stress management during the pandemic. Therefore, it is thought that the dissemination of healthy eating attitudes in society may contribute to the maintenance of physical and mental health in the event of a pandemic. © 2021-IOS Press.

Thus, it is inescapable that teacher professional development can no longer be understood as an option, but rather as the only effective tool to respond to rapid social transformations, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Within this framework, the concept of Learning Ecologies emerges as an effective perspective to holistically integrate the various existing training opportunities in each individual ' s environment. The aim of this study is to analyse the professional development process of Primary Education teachers, through an ecological perspective. In other words, it is intended to identify and interpret those elements that make up the Learning Ecologies of teachers in this educational stage. This research has been carried out through a qualitative design and, specifically, through the tradition of the Case Study. Five teachers who carry out their work in Primary Education in different public schools in the province of A Coruna (Galicia, Spain) participated in the study. For the collection of information, the semi-structured interview has been used, and the software Atlas.ti (8.1) for the data analysis. Regarding the personal dimension of Learning Ecologies, the results show the importance given to lifelong learning, and the clear intrinsic motivational orientation of the participants to get involved in their training process. In connection with the contextual dimension, it should be noted that teachers carry out different activities, use multiple resources and carry out various interactions with the aim of keeping up to date and improving their teaching practice. The ecological approach contributes to the design of a personalised learning itinerary better aligned with the interests and training needs of each teacher.","Estevez, I.; Souto-Seijo, A.; Rey, P.

While parental support is usually more diffuse, and is secondary in relation to what is done at school, occurring at different moments of daily life, home schooling during lockdown revealed new ways of helping and framing schoolwork. This article looks at parenting practices in higher socio-economic status (SES) families in France. Based on a massive questionnaire (N = 31,764) and a series of additional interviews (N = 15) conducted during lockdown, the aim is to investigate what makes parental assistance specific in high SES environments. Our findings show that such families have less difficulty carrying out schooling at home. What makes them consider this experience as ?not a big deal?, as they say, is that they have organisational and pedagogical (i.e. objective) resources that enable them to respond to its challenges. In addition, however, we show that home schooling is experienced in these families as less contrived. In effect, they use schoolwork techniques that help to obscure (from others, but also from themselves) the effort that schoolwork requires.","Delès, Romain",European Educational Research Journal,183,1

The CS process thus retains the original mechanical and chemical properties of the coating material. Residual stresses are an important factor affecting the quality, strength, and performance of the coated substrate in CS process. Currently, there is a lack of clear understanding of the residual stress generation in CS process and its control measures. Existing studies have not investigated the type III residual stress in CS process. This study attempts to investigate the effects of impact velocity and angle of impact on the Type III residual stress generation in CS process using molecular dynamics simulation technique. The study considers the impact of nanosized copper particles on copper substrate and the magnitude of the residual stresses is monitored. It is seen that the coated surface retains both tensile and compressive residual stresses. A higher angle impact shows higher compressive residual stresses, which are beneficial to industrial applications. Similarly, 400 m/s impact velocity showed the highest distribution of compressive residual stress on the body. The study results would be crucial in extending the industrial applications of the CS process.","James, Sagil; Shah, Karan",Procedia Manufacturing,183,1

It has changed the daily lives of families including the sexual behavior of couples due to public health concerns and government policy to restrict people’s movement. It has changed both interpersonal and partner relationships;the time availability at home, the continued presence of children at home, the fear of infection, and the inability to physically interact with others have changed most people’s sexual behavior. AIM: This study aims to evaluate sexual behavior changes in marriage people of Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional online study was conducted, using self-constructed questionnaires. The convenience sample was collected from married males and females for at least 10 months from November 2020 to January 2021. The participants were asked 19 and 20 questions for female and male, respectively, which was an adaptation of the previous questionnaires. Furthermore, a study was conducted to analyze descriptively the changes of sexuality among married people before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: About 201 participants who completed the survey, 110 males (54.7%) and 91 females (45.3%) were included in the analyses. The mean age of participants was 37 years old. Most of the participants have middle to high socio-economy classes and have children at home. Shifting in the work schedule is the main reason to change sexual behaviors. Participants experienced significant changes in sexual behaviors and some sexual responses before and during the restriction time. CONCLUSION: The pandemic has changed sexual behaviors due to social restrictions in Indonesia. These findings imply messages about the consequences of the pandemic on sexual behaviors that may affect the sexual relationship, marriage stability, and physical health itself to fight coronavirus.","Tribowo, J.

Consequently, in the absence of specific regulatory references, ethics committees frequently evaluate observational studies by applying the criteria that apply to clinical trials. This leads to inappropriate weighting and stiffness. To counter the Covid-19 pandemic, measures have been adopted to facilitate research, including observational research.

Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with crucial mutations pose a global challenge in context of therapeutic drugs and vaccines being developed globally. There are currently no specific therapeutics or vaccines available to combat SARS-CoV-2 devastation. In view of this, the current study aimed to identify and characterize the mutations found in the Nsp13 of SARS-CoV-2 in Indian isolates. Non-structural protein, Nsp13 protein sequences from Indian isolates were analyzed by comparing with the first reported Severe acute respiratory syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) protein sequence from Wuhan, China. Out of 825 Nsp13 protein sequences, a total of 38 mutations were observed among Indian isolates. Our data show that mutations in Nsp13 at various positions (H164Y, A237T, T214I, C309Y, S236I, P419S, V305E, G54S, H290Y, P53S, A308Y, and A308Y) have a significant impact on the protein’s stability and flexibility. Also, the impact of Nsp13 mutations on the protein function were predicted based on PROVEAN score that includes 15 mutants as neutral and 23 mutants as deleterious effect. Furthermore, B-cell epitopes contributed by Nsp13 were identified using various predictive immunoinformatic tools. Immunological Parameters of Nsp13 such as antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity were evaluated to predict the potential B-cell epitopes. The predicted peptide sequences were correlated with the observed mutants. Our predicted data showed that there are seven high rank linear epitopes as well as 18 discontinuous B-cell epitopes based on immunoinformatic tools. Moreover, it was observed that out of total 38 identified mutations among Indian SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 protein, four mutant residues at position 142 (E142), 245 (H245), 247 (V247) and 419 (P419) are localised in the predicted B cell epitopic region. Altogether, the results of the present in-silico study might help to understand the impact of the identified mutations in Nsp13 protein on its stability, flexibility and function.","Kumari, Deepa; Kumari, Namrata; Kumar, Sudhir; Sinha, Prabhat Kumar; Shahi, Shivendra Kumar; Biswas, Nihar Ranjan; Kumar, Abhay",bioRxiv,183,1

It reminds us that intelligent manufacturing certainly will play a key role in the future. Dynamic shop scheduling is also an inevitable hot topic in intelligent manufacturing. However, traditional dynamic scheduling is a kind of passive scheduling mode which takes measures to adjust disturbed scheduling processes after the occurrence of dynamic events. It is difficult to ensure the stability of production because of lack of proactivity. To overcome these shortcomings, manufacturing big data and data technologies as the core driving force of intelligent manufacturing will be used to guide production. Thus, a data-driven proactive scheduling approach is proposed to deal with the dynamic events, especially for machine breakdown. In this paper, the overall procedure of the proposed approach is introduced. More specifically, we first use collected manufacturing data to predict the occurrence of machine breakdowns and provide reliable input for dynamic scheduling.

Distance education tools were to be applied and digital platforms of the universities were to be checked. This paper deals with the experience of the National Research South Ural University. The courses of all the schools and institutes of the University were conducted based on the platform Digital SUSU. The example of the courses for second language learning was discussed. Fifty students of bachelor's and master's degrees were respondents in this research. The students answered the questions of the questionnaire on Google Forms and then were interviewed. The results suggest that the most interesting task on the planform Digital SUSU was a video with tasks and vocabulary exercises. However, among the most useful, according to the students' opinion were grammar, vocabulary, and reading tasks. The students were also asked to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of such remote learning. The most frequently mentioned advantages were the ability to study at home and the absence of the necessity to look smart. However, the disadvantages were more varied, including absence of communication, no face to face contact, too much homework, and too many written tasks.","Nenakhova, E.",International Journal of Instruction,183,16

The study employs a JD-R model to explain general and travel-specific job exhaustion (IBTExh) through international business travel as demand and leadership (LMX) as a resource buffering the demands of international business travel.Design/methodology/approachThe study was conducted among Finnish service company employees who had taken at least one international business trip during the previous year. The data (N = 569), collected in 2015, were analyzed with path models.FindingsThe results suggest that a higher number of international business travel days is related to a higher level of job exhaustion, especially the exhaustion related to international business travel. Moreover, a high-quality LMX was found to be linked to lower levels of both types of exhaustion. Interestingly, for those IBTs' with a low-quality LMX, even a high number of long-haul international business travel days was not connected with IBTExhOriginality/valueThe contribution of our study is threefold. First, this study contributes to JD-R theory and the ill-health process by focusing on a job-specific well-being indicator, IBTExh, in addition to general exhaustion. Second, specific job demands related to international business travel, particularly the duration of business travel spent in short-haul and long-haul destinations, contributes to the literature on global mobility. This study sheds light on the potential effects on IBTs of different types of business travel.

Here we describe a progressive evolutionary downregulation of pathogen sensing inflammasome pathways in Carnivora. This includes the loss of nucleotide-oligomerisation domain leucine rich repeat receptors (NLRs), acquisition of a unique caspase−1/−4 effector fusion protein that processes gasdermin D pore formation without inducing lytic cell death and the formation of an NLRP3-caspase-8 containing inflammasome that inefficiently processes interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Inflammasomes regulate gut immunity, but the carnivorous diet is antimicrobial suggesting a tolerance to the loss of these immune pathways.

Metagenomic sequencing rapidly revealed the causative agent of this outbreak to be a novel coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2. Herein, to provide a snapshot of the pathogens in pneumonia-associated respiratory samples from Wuhan prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 408 patients presenting with pneumonia and acute respiratory infections at the Central Hospital of Wuhan between 2016 and 2017. Unbiased total RNA sequencing was performed to reveal their ""total infectome"", including viruses, bacteria and fungi. Consequently, we identified 37 pathogen species, comprising 15 RNA viruses, 3 DNA viruses, 16 bacteria and 3 fungi, often at high abundance and including multiple co-infections (12.8%). However, SARS-CoV-2 was not present. These data depict a stable core infectome comprising common respiratory pathogens such as rhinoviruses and influenza viruses, an atypical respiratory virus (EV-D68), and a single case of a sporadic zoonotic pathogen - Chlamydia psittaci. Samples from patients experiencing respiratory disease on average had higher pathogen abundance than healthy controls. Phylogenetic analyses of individual pathogens revealed multiple origins and global transmission histories, highlighting the connectedness of the Wuhan population. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the pathogens associated with acute respiratory infections and pneumonia, which were more diverse and complex than obtained using targeted PCR or qPCR approaches.

While previous methods often treat the detection of each putative connection as a separate hypothesis test, here we develop a modeling approach that infers synaptic connections while incorporating circuit properties learned from the whole network. We use an extension of the Generalized Linear Model framework to describe the cross-correlograms between pairs of neurons and separate correlograms into two parts: a slowly varying effect due to background fluctuations and a fast, transient effect due to the synapse. We then use the observations from all putative connections in the recording to estimate two network properties: the presynaptic neuron type (excitatory or inhibitory) and the relationship between synaptic latency and distance between neurons. Constraining the presynaptic neuron’s type, synaptic latencies, and time constants improves synapse detection. In data from simulated networks, this model outperforms two previously developed synapse detection methods, especially on the weak connections. We also apply our model to in vitro multielectrode array recordings from mouse somatosensory cortex. Here our model automatically recovers plausible connections from hundreds of neurons, and the properties of the putative connections are largely consistent with previous research. New & Noteworthy Detecting synaptic connections using large-scale extracellular spike recordings is a difficult statistical problem.

It is very important to examine the strategies universities are using to efficiently transfer skills and knowledge and meet the needs of students through an online learning environment. Art and design classes involve hands-on activities and requirements that cannot easily be met in digital environments. Therefore, the study aims to investigate the creative approaches that art and design educators adopted to transition to remote teaching. The study involved conducting an online focus group with eleven art and design educators at The University of Bahrain to investigate the experiences, perceptions, and the challenges they faced while teaching art and design remotely during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The focus group engaged the educators in a semi-structured discussion in order to gather qualitative data that would allow for a descriptive analysis of their online teaching experiences and the most effective approaches they implemented. Thus, the study is undertaken to determine the most effective practices that can be employed by educators to engage students and enhance the distance learning process in an art and design online environment. The findings suggested that the main challenges that are peculiar to art and design distance learning include difficulty in clearly seeing the value of the colors in a student’s artwork on screen and the unavailability of features that support art and design remote teaching in the currently available learning management systems. © 2021 Society for Research and Knowledge Management.

While structural similarities between poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2 could have major implications for the COVID-19 response worldwide, polio-induced immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 have not been confirmed in prospective clinical trials. Objective: To evaluate whether immune sera from adults who recently received inactivated poliovirus vaccination (IPV) can block SARS-CoV-2's ability to synthesize RNA. Intervention: IPV intramuscular injection. Measurements: Pre-inoculation and 4-weeks post-inoculation sera were tested for anti-3Dpol (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp) antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). To assess IPV's ability to induce antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis, immune-based detection assays tested RdRp enzymatic activity in polio-immune sera. Results: 298 of the 300 enrolled participants completed both on-site visits. Comparing pre-inoculation to 4-week samples, 85.2% of participants demonstrated an increase in anti-3Dpol antibodies against RdRp proteins. Among tested post-inoculation samples, 94.4% demonstrated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis. Few inoculation-related side effects were reported (2.0%), all were minor. Limitations: Participants were not systematically tested for COVID-19, though known exposures were reported and positive results (1.7%) were documented. Conclusion: IPV can induce antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis, minimizing the risk of viral replication in infected individuals.

Our patients suffering from chronic inflammatory rheumatism (CIR), a group of autoimmune pathologies treated by immunosuppressant medication, are particularly concerned. Actions taken -particularly quarantine and its effects on the normal activities, habits or livelihoods of many people -also have a significant impact. There is little information on the impact of the lockdown in patients with CIR with data measured prospectively, in a standardized way, before and during the first lockdown period. Objectives: The objective of this ancillary study was to evaluate the psychological impact of the first lockdown period (anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, catastrophizing.) as well as the evolution of disease activity in patients suffering from CIR. Methods: At two French university hospitals, adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) according to the ACR-EULAR 2010 criteria, spondyloarthritis (SpA) fulfilling the ASAS 2009 criteria and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) according to the Caspar 2006 criteria were consecutively included in the Catastrophism in Chronic Inflammatory Rheumatism (CRIC) study from September 2019. Sociodemographic data, information on the disease and its treatments were collected as well as questionnaires on disease activity (DAS28, CDAI, BASDAI), function (HAQ), quality of life (SF12, EQ5D), anxiety and depression (HADS, GAD7), insomnia (ISI) and catastrophizing scores (PCS). These data were collected prospectively at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. In this ancillary study, data from patients with an assessment before and during lockdown were analyzed. Statistical analyses were descriptive with a paired Student's T-test. Results: In all, 140 patients (49 RA, 69 SpA and 22 PsA) were evaluated before and during lockdown. The median age was 53.5 [44-63] years and 60.7% were women;74 patients (53.2%) were professionally active and 102 (72.9%) were living as couples. The majority of patients (92.9 %) had a disease lasting more than 2 years. Concerning treatments, 63 (45%) were treated by bDMARD monotherapy, 40 (28.5%) by bDMARD+ csDMARD, 17 (12.1%) by csDMARD monotherapy and 2 patients by tsDMARD;90.7% were not taking any corticosteroids and 8.6% were taking ≤5 mg/d;30% were on NSAIDs. When comparing before and during lockdown, pain, tender joint count, swollen joint count, disease activity (CDAI, BASDAI) and function (HAQ, SF12 physical component) were similar. However, there was a significant improvement in psychological status, anxiety (HADS, GAD7), the mental component of SF12, catastrophizing and overall quality of life (EQ5D) (see Table 1 below). Conclusion: There are very few prospective, standardized data on the impact of lockdown in patients with CIR with an assessment before and during the first lockdown period. In patients with CIR, the first lockdown period had no impact on the activity of the disease and was well experienced psychologically with less anxiety and an improvement in quality of life.","Gaujoux-Viala, C.; Traverson, C.; Filhol, E.; Daien, C.; Laurent-Chabalier, S.; Combe, B.; Lukas, C.; Morel, J.; Hua, C.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,183,1

In international negotiations, people may assume that high-trust nations are more likely to produce more trustworthy negotiators. Does this assumption hold universally? This study aims to address this research question by investigating the relationship between national-level societal trust and individual-level trust in negotiations.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a cross-sectional research design and a sample of 910 senior managers from 58 nations or regions. The hypotheses are tested by hierarchical linear modeling.FindingsThis study draws on the dynamic constructivist theory of culture to propose moderated hypotheses. Results show that societal trust predicts individuals’ social perceptions of attitudinal trust in negotiations, only when cultural face norms are weak rather than strong;societal trust predicts individuals’ social perceptions of behavioral trust in negotiations (i.e. high information sharing and low competitive behavior), only when negotiators process information analytically rather than holistically.Originality/valueThis study is the first to examine the relationship between national-level societal trust (i.e. generalized trust) and individual-level trust in negotiations (i.e. particularistic trust). It uses a large-scale, multinational sample to show that relying on societal trust to infer trust in negotiations is valid only in Western societies.","Yao, Jingjing Brett Jeanne M.",International Journal of Conflict Management,183,11

Scalable transcriptional analysis routine (STAR) represents a novel integration of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis that allows detection of dozens of gene transcripts in a multiplexed format using amplicon size as an identifier for each target. STAR demonstrated similar or better sensitivity and precision compared to two commonly used methods, SYBR Green-based and TaqMan probe-based real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. STAR can be used as a flexible platform for building a variety of applications to monitor gene expression, from single gene assays to assays analyzing the expression level of multiple genes. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus as a model system, STAR technology detected single copies of the viral genome in a two-gene multiplex. Blinded studies using RNA extracted from various tissues of a SARS-infected individual showed that STAR correctly identified all samples containing SARS virus and yielded negative results for non-SARS control samples. Using alternate priming strategies, STAR technology can be adapted to transcriptional profiling studies without requiring a priori sequence information. Thus, STAR technology offers a flexible platform for development of highly multiplexed assays in gene expression analysis and molecular diagnostics.","Garcia, Elizabeth P.; Dowding, Lori A.; Stanton, Lawrence W.; Slepnev, Vladimir I.",The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics,183,27

Inevitably, this evolution is further extended to individuals' adoption towards a new set of consumption behaviour. In the current global coronavirus pandemic (termed COVID 19), consumers are further contemplating on alternative forms of payment in pursuit of a safer method to purchase goods and services. Contactless payments, for example, have proven to provide benefits to both businesses and consumers alike, in terms of higher levels of control and convenience for consumers, and higher return on investment (ROI) for business merchants. Following this concern, this study was conducted to investigate the extent to which perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, trust, convenience, and fear affect consumers' attitude towards the use of contactless payment. It also aims to examine whether attitude influences consumers' intention towards the use of contactless transactions. Using a non-probability sampling technique, data were collected from 200 respondents via online questionnaire survey distribution.

Translating knowledge is particularly crucial in the healthcare sector, which is currently under significant pressure due to technological innovation, increasing demand of services by an ageing population, budget reductions, and new organisational challenges posed by the latest events like the COVID-19 pandemic. While the first definition of KT was focused on the translation of scientific research into clinical practice, other types of KT later emerged. In healthcare, while stakeholders have different skills and competencies (such as clinical scientists versus physicians or other healthcare professionals), others experience diverse emotional feelings (like the patients or their families). An effective KT allows the transfer, sharing, and creation of new knowledge, enhancing innovation and co-production dynamics. The paper employs a case study by analysing the Breast Unit of the C.R.O. National Cancer Institue of Aviano, Italy, one of the most acknowledged hospitals and research centres in Europe in the field of cancer surgery and treatments. The paper aims at studying the knowledge translation dynamics and tools by analysing the various relationships with the internal as well as the external stakeholders of the Breast Unit. Internally, knowledge translation is needed to merge the competencies of highly skilled multidisciplinary teams, which include surgeons and physicians with various specialities, researchers, psychologists, nurses and other healthcare professionals. Externally, knowledge is translated to meet the needs of patients, patients' associations, sponsors, citizens, and policymakers. Results highlight how different techniques and dynamics allow KT to happen within internal as well as external groups. Contributing to the knowledge management and knowledge translation theories, our findings open up to practical as well as research implications.

Although diverse immune aberrance was reported, a global understanding of immune responses underlying acute KD was lacking. Based on single-cell sequencing, we profiled peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with acute KD before and after intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and from healthy controls. Most differentially expressed genes were derived from monocytes, with upregulation of immunoglobulin receptors, complement and receptors and downregulation of MHC class II receptors before therapy. The percentage of B cells was significantly increased before therapy and rapidly returned to normal after therapy. There was also an increased abundance of B-cell receptors with IGHA and IGHG after therapy, accompanied by massive oligoclonal expansion. The percentage of CD8 T cells was remarkably decreased during acute KD, especially the subset of effector memory CD8 T cells. All lymphocyte compartments were characterized by underexpressed interferon response pathways before therapy. The identification of unique innate and adaptive immune responses suggests potential mechanisms underlying pathogenesis and progression of KD.","Wang, Zhen; Xie, Lijian; Song, Sirui; Chen, Liqin; Li, Guang; Liu, Jia; Xiao, Tingting; Zhang, Hong; Huang, Yujuan; Ding, Guohui; Li, Yixue; Huang, Min",bioRxiv,183,25

By analyzing the recent course of the party systems in the region, we also argue that the so-called turn to the right constitutes a process of power alternation generated by the punishment of incumbents of the last decade and a half (mostly on the left), rather than a structural ideological realignment. This alternation in power occurs in a context, in which established parties tend to disappear or become substantially weaker, and in which short-lived electoral vehicles are gaining traction. Finally, we argue that there does not seem to be space in the region today -especially because of the social crisis associated with the effects of the covid-19 pandemic- for the strengthening of a neoliberal right. However, the current context does seem propitious for the emergence of right-wing outsiders, capable of structuring a pro-order agenda that incorporates, in different proportions, 'iron-hand' policies, value conservatism, and market liberalism.","Luna, Juan Pablo Kaltwasser Cristóbal Rovira",Revista Uruguaya de Ciencia Política,183,9

In Drosophila, Dicer-1 produces ∼22-24-nt miRNAs from pre-miRNAs, whereas Dicer-2 makes 21-nt siRNAs from long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). How Dicer-2 precisely makes 21-nt siRNAs with a remarkably high fidelity is unknown. Here we report that recognition of the 5'-monophosphate of a long dsRNA substrate by a phosphate-binding pocket in the Dicer-2 PAZ (Piwi, Argonaute, and Zwille/Pinhead) domain is crucial for the length fidelity, but not the efficiency, in 21-nt siRNA production. Loss of the length fidelity, meaning increased length heterogeneity of siRNAs, caused by point mutations in the phosphate-binding pocket of the Dicer-2 PAZ domain decreased RNA silencing activity in vivo, showing the importance of the high fidelity to make 21-nt siRNAs. We propose that the 5'-monophosphate of a long dsRNA substrate is anchored by the phosphate-binding pocket in the Dicer-2 PAZ domain and the distance between the pocket and the RNA cleavage active site in the RNaseIII domain corresponds to the 21-nt pitch in the A-form duplex of a long dsRNA substrate, resulting in high-fidelity 21-nt siRNA production. This study sheds light on the molecular mechanism by which Dicer-2 produces 21-nt siRNAs with a remarkably high fidelity for efficient RNA silencing.","Kandasamy, Suresh K; Fukunaga, Ryuya",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,183,1

Immunofluorescence testing and immunoperoxidase labeling of coronavirus-infected cells showed that these reagents were monospecific for E1. In addition, by using hybrid proteins containing different lengths of the E1 carboxy terminus to affinity-purify a polyclonal antiserum against E1, we have been able to define two epitopes within the last 15 amino acid residues of the protein.

Seven species of RNase-resistant RF RNAs, whose sizes were consistent with the fact that each was derived from an RI that was engaged in the synthesis of one of the seven MHV positive-strand RNAs, were produced by treatment with RNase A. Because the radiolabeling of the seven RF RNAs was proportional to that of the corresponding seven positive-strand RNAs, the relative rate of synthesis of each of the MHV positive-strand RNAs may be controlled by the relative number of each of the size classes of RIs that are produced. In contrast to alphavirus, which produced its subgenome-length RF RNAs from genome-length RIs, MHV RF RNAs were derived from genome- and subgenome-length RIs. Only the three largest MHV RF RNAs (RFI, RFII, and RFIII) were derived from the RIs that migrated slowest on agarose gels. The four smallest RF RNAs (RFIV, RFV, RFVI, and RFVII) were derived from RIs that migrated in a broad region of the gel that extended from the position of 28S rRNA to the position of the viral single-stranded MHV mRNA-3. Because all seven RIs were labeled during very short pulses with [3H]uridine, we concluded that the subgenome-length RIs are transcriptionally active. These findings, with the recent report of the presence of subgenome-length negative-strand RNAs in cells infected with porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (P. B. Sethna, S.-L. Hung, and D. A. Brian, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 5626-5630, 1989), strongly suggest that coronaviruses utilize a novel replication strategy that employs the synthesis of subgenomic negative strands to produce subgenomic mRNAs.","Sawicki, S G; Sawicki, D L",Journal of virology,183,24

They are mainly localised at the interface between body surfaces and the environment, continuously scrutinising incoming antigen for the potential threat it may represent to the organism. In the respiratory tract, DCs constitute a tightly enmeshed network, with the most prominent populations localised in the epithelium of the conducting airways and lung parenchyma. Their unique localisation enables them to continuously assess inhaled antigen, either inducing tolerance to inoffensive substances, or initiating immunity against a potentially harmful pathogen. This immunological homeostasis requires stringent control mechanisms to protect the vital and fragile gaseous exchange barrier from unrestrained and damaging inflammation, or an exaggerated immune response to an innocuous allergen, such as in allergic asthma. During DC activation, there is upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules and maturation markers, enabling DC to activate naïve T cells. This activation is accompanied by chemokine and cytokine release that not only serves to amplify innate immune response, but also determines the type of effector T cell population generated. An increasing body of recent literature provides evidence that different DC subpopulations, such as myeloid DC (mDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) in the lungs occupy a key position at the crossroads between tolerance and immunity. This review aims to provide the clinician and researcher with a summary of the latest insights into DC-mediated pulmonary immune regulation and its relevance for developing novel therapeutic strategies for various disease conditions such as infection, asthma, COPD, and fibrotic lung disease.","von Garnier, Christophe; Nicod, Laurent P",Swiss medical weekly,183,24

Here, we develop a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier to investigate ⍺-helical AMPs and the interrelated nature of their functional commonality and sequence homology. SVM is used to search the undiscovered peptide sequence space and identify Pareto-optimal candidates that simultaneously maximize the distance σ from the SVM hyperplane (thus maximize its ""antimicrobialness"") and its ⍺-helicity, but minimize mutational distance to known AMPs. By calibrating SVM machine learning results with killing assays and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we find that the SVM metric σ correlates not with a peptide's minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), but rather its ability to generate negative Gaussian membrane curvature. This surprising result provides a topological basis for membrane activity common to AMPs. Moreover, we highlight an important distinction between the maximal recognizability of a sequence to a trained AMP classifier (its ability to generate membrane curvature) and its maximal antimicrobial efficacy. As mutational distances are increased from known AMPs, we find AMP-like sequences that are increasingly difficult for nature to discover via simple mutation. Using the sequence map as a discovery tool, we find a unexpectedly diverse taxonomy of sequences that are just as membrane-active as known AMPs, but with a broad range of primary functions distinct from AMP functions, including endogenous neuropeptides, viral fusion proteins, topogenic peptides, and amyloids. The SVM classifier is useful as a general detector of membrane activity in peptide sequences.","Lee, Ernest Y; Fulan, Benjamin M; Wong, Gerard C L; Ferguson, Andrew L",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,183,16

The virus contained 11 segments of double-stranded RNA and had an electrophoretic migration pattern in polyacrylamide gels similar to that of other group C rotaviruses (4-3-2-2). Feces containing the bovine virus reacted with antiserum to porcine group C rotavirus (Cowden strain) but not group A or B rotaviruses in immunoelectron microscopy. The virus was adapted to serial propagation in roller tube cultures of a rhesus monkey kidney cell line (MA104) by using high concentrations of trypsin. Evidence for viral replication in MA104 cell cultures was demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy and indirect immunofluorescence by using antiserum to porcine group C rotavirus and by electrophoretic analysis of extracted viral double-stranded RNA. A significant antibody response against the isolate was detected in convalescent-phase sera of cows which excreted the virus: no increased antibody response to bovine group A rotavirus was observed. To our knowledge, this is the first isolation of a group C rotavirus from cattle.","Tsunemitsu, H; Saif, L J; Jiang, B M; Shimizu, M; Hiro, M; Yamaguchi, H; Ishiyama, T; Hirai, T",Journal of clinical microbiology,183,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS Chest radiographs of patients confirmed with COVID-19 in Hospital Tawau, Sabah, Malaysia were retrospectively analyzed by two radiologists. The radiographic pattern, distribution among subgroups and evolution of the disease over time were determined. RESULTS Among the 82 patients studied, 65 (79.3%) were males. Mean age of our cohorts was 37 ± 15 years. Baseline chest radiographs were abnormal in 37 patients (45.1%). Over half (52.9%) of the symptomatic patients had abnormal baseline radiograph. Among the children, patients with comorbidities, and patients 60 years of age and above, the abnormal radiographs were 14.3%, 71.4% and 69.3% respectively. Ground glass opacities were the commonest abnormal radiographic feature (35.4%), were peripherally located (35.4%) with predilection for the lower zones (29.3%). Most radiographic abnormalities were multifocal (20.7%) and frequently located in the left lung (19.5%). Radiographic recovery was observed in 15 of 18 patients (83%). Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated greater extent of the disease than observed in radiographs of the same patient. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 pneumonia presented with a specific radiographic pattern in our cohort of patients, comprising of ground glass opacities in peripheral and basilar distribution, affecting a single lung field and was observed in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Chest radiograph is a useful adjunct screening tool, and in combination with clinical and epidemiological assessment may facilitate in early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Letchumanan, M; Anour, A A; Ganapathy, S S; Harry, S; Nik Lah, N S H; Arsad, N; Fisol, N F A",The Medical journal of Malaysia,183,16

Daily updates of the models with real data allow forecasting some key indicators for decision-making (an Excel file in the Supplemental material allows computing them). These are beds allocation, residence time, doubling time, rate of renewal, maximum daily rate of change (positive/negative), halfway points, maximum plateaus, asymptotic conditions, and dates and time intervals when some key thresholds are overtaken. Doubling time of ICU beds for Covid-19 emergency can be as low as 2–3 days at the outbreak of the pandemic. The models allow identifying the possible departure of the phenomenon from the predicted trend and thus can play the role of early warning systems and describe further outbreaks.","Manca, Davide; Caldiroli, Dario; Storti, Enrico",Comput.

Based on previous widespread disasters, future high prevalence of short- and long-term adverse mental health consequences are anticipated. Studies of COVID-19 outside the United States indicated moderately high levels of distress, but we have little information regarding Americans' distress nor the factors associated with relative distress or adjustment during this unprecedented time. This study represents the first national view of Americans' distress during the massive disruption of COVID-19 and identifies levels of stress exposure, protective psychosocial resources, and coping strategies. METHOD: Data were collected April 7-9, 2020 from an online platform, using best practices for ensuring high-quality data; 1,015 completed respondents are included ([53.9%] women; average age = 38.9 years; mostly White [82.4%] and non-Hispanic [91.5%]). Respondents' locations ranged across the United States, from 18.5% in the Northeast to 37.8% in the South. RESULTS: Fairly high levels of stress exposure and peritraumatic and general distress (depression, anxiety, and stress) were reported. Emotion regulation skills along with active and distraction coping emerged as the strongest predictors of lower distress levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results identify potential targets for online mental health interventions-focusing on engaging in adaptive emotion regulation and coping (e.g., through telehealth mental health first aid)-during the pandemic to offset the likely rise in distress over the months ahead.

However, despite being extensively studied, these sequential methods still suffer from three limitations. First, existing methods mostly utilize attention on the behavior of users, which is not always suitable for CTR prediction, because users often click on new products that are irrelevant to any historical behaviors. Second, in the real scenario, there exist numerous users that have operations a long time ago, but turn relatively inactive in recent times. Thus, it is hard to precisely capture user's current preferences through early behaviors. Third, multiple representations of user's historical behaviors in different feature subspaces are largely ignored. To remedy these issues, we propose a Multi-Interactive Attention Network (MIAN) to comprehensively extract the latent relationship among all kinds of fine-grained features (e.g., gender, age and occupation in user-profile). Specifically, MIAN contains a Multi-Interactive Layer (MIL) that integrates three local interaction modules to capture multiple representations of user preference through sequential behaviors and simultaneously utilize the fine-grained user-specific as well as context information. In addition, we design a Global Interaction Module (GIM) to learn the high-order interactions and balance the different impacts of multiple features. Finally, Offline experiment results from three datasets, together with an Online A/B test in a large-scale recommendation system, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.","Zhang, Kai; Qian, Hao; Cui, Qing; Liu, Qi; Li, Longfei; Zhou, Jun; Ma, Jianhui; Chen, Enhong",,183,16

Suddenly, teachers, professors, and students had to migrate from presential classes to the online system without prior notice or a training course. This paper aimed to verify how the need of a rapid change to the online system in response to the impossibility of keeping the presential system due to the mandatory social distancing imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic has affected relationships and performance of teachers, professors, and students, as well as review the technologies and procedures adopted by them to innovate and achieve sustainable education. To address the empirical side of this exploratory research, the authors of this paper sent an email questionnaire to kindergarten, elementary and high school teachers in the City of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), as well as to professors of the top 197 Brazilian universities. To address theoretical side of this exploratory research, an investigation was carried out through scientific databases. The data were analyzed with SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), version 22.0, and with Microsoft Excel 2007. As a result, this paper showed that social isolation and transition to the online system greatly affected the work conditions of teachers and professors, as well as the learning process of students. Anyway, sustainable actions were taken to overcome these challenges.

The viral genome is considered to be relatively stable and the mutations that have been observed and reported thus far are mainly focused on the coding region. This article provides evidence that macrolevel pandemic dynamics, such as social distancing, modulate the genomic evolution of SARS-CoV-2. This view complements the prevalent paradigm that microlevel observables control macrolevel parameters such as death rates and infection patterns. First, we observe differences in mutational signals for geospatially separated populations such as the prevalence of A23404G in CA versus NY and WA. We show that the feedback between macrolevel dynamics and the viral population can be captured employing a transfer entropy framework. Second, we observe complex interactions within mutational clades. Namely, when C14408T first appeared in the viral population, the frequency of A23404G spiked in the subsequent week. Third, we identify a noncoding mutation, G29540A, within the segment between the coding gene of the N protein and the ORF10 gene, which is largely confined to NY ([Formula: see text]95%). These observations indicate that macrolevel sociobehavioral measures have an impact on the viral genomics and may be useful for the dashboard-like tracking of its evolution. Finally, despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is a genetically robust organism, our findings suggest that we are dealing with a high degree of adaptability. Owing to its ample spread, mutations of unusual form are observed and a high complexity of mutational interaction is exhibited.","Barrett, Christopher; Bura, Andrei C; He, Qijun; Huang, Fenix W; Li, Thomas J X; Waterman, Michael S; Reidys, Christian M",J. comput. biol,183,16

The FET assay enables the assessment of multiple morphological endpoints during the development of zebrafish early life stages, showing high impact to the field of ecotoxicology on risk assessment of chemicals and pollutants. Moreover, it is also applied to screening drug-induced toxicity and human diseases, due to the high genetic and physiological orthology between zebrafish and humans. Here, we describe FET test, with all steps and several adaptations involved in the methodological procedures. To demonstrate the efficiency of this method, results using the reference substance 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA) were included to demonstrate sublethal and teratogenic malformations on zebrafish embryos.

At that time, the better assessment of the radio-induced malignancies, essentially in children and young patients, as well as the efficacy of the new anti-inflammatory drugs (steroids and non-steroids), led to the almost disappearance of those techniques, at least in France. In contrast, our German colleagues are still going on treating about 50,000 patients per year for non-malignant (more or less severe) diseases. After a short historical overview, the present article suggests that we were possibly going too far in the rejection of those low-dose irradiations for benign lesions. The recent emergence of new preclinical data, the better understanding of the risk of radio-induced secondary tumours (almost nil in the elderly), and the severity of some situations, such as the cytokine storm of the COVID-19, should probably lead us to reconsider those low - and sometimes very low (less than 1Gy) - irradiations for well-selected indications in the elderly.","Cosset, J-M; Deutsch, E",Cancer radiother,183,23

METHODS: Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat high-sugar (HFHS) diet for 8 weeks to induce obesity. After the first 8 weeks, TM5441 was added to the diet for an additional 8 weeks. In order to determine the efficacy of PAI-1 inhibition in conjunction with dietary modification, mice were fed an HFHS diet for 8 weeks to induce obesity and were then switched to a low-fat diet with or without TM5441 for an additional 2 to 8 weeks. RESULTS: Obese mice showed weight reduction and significant improvement in hepatic steatosis when TM5441 was added to the HFHS diet. Obese mice that were treated with TM5441 in conjunction with dietary modification showed enhanced weight loss and a more rapid reversal of hepatic steatosis compared with obese mice treated with dietary modification alone. The enhanced weight loss among mice treated with TM5441 was associated with increased adipose tissue expression of adipose triglyceride lipase, phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase, and phosphorylated perilipin-1 as well as induction of adipose tissue lipolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacologic PAI-1 inhibition stimulates adipose tissue lipolysis and enhances weight loss in obese mice.","Levine, Joshua A; Olivares, Shantel; Miyata, Toshio; Vaughan, Douglas E; Henkel, Anne S",Obesity (Silver Spring),183,20

The incidence of HO is related to various factors, including soft-tissue trauma, postoperative medication, surgical approach, and the surgeon's experience. Because use of the direct anterior approach (DAA) is gaining popularity, we aimed (1) to determine the incidence of HO after DAA-THA and (2) to evaluate the impact of HO on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 401 THAs (67 ± 10 years old, 210 men). The incidence and grade of HO were evaluated using the Brooker classification with anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. PROs were collected with use of the Oxford Hip Score (OHS) and the Core Outcome Measures Index (COMI)-Hip and were correlated with HO grades using generalized multiple regression models. RESULTS: The incidence of HO was 29.9% on the anteroposterior radiographic views (Brooker grade 1, 14.5%; grade 2, 11.1%; grade 3, 2.7%; and grade 4, 0.57%); the lateral radiographic views detected 9% additional HO when compared with the anteroposterior radiographs alone (Brooker grade 1, 8%, and grade 2, 1%). HO was more frequent in men. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, age in women, and higher body mass index (BMI) in men were associated with higher HO grades. A transverse ""bikini"" incision was associated with a lower rate (4%) of Brooker grades 3 and 4 HO when compared with a longitudinal incision (12%). A Brooker grade of 0 to 3 HO did not impact outcomes. Only Brooker grade-4 HO was associated with significantly worse PROs; however, pain was not affected. CONCLUSIONS: Low-grade HO after DAA-THA is not uncommon, and its rate is underestimated when anteroposterior radiographic views are evaluated without lateral views. The risk factors for developing HO in our cohort were an ASA grade of >3, male sex (especially with a high BMI), older age in women, and use of longitudinal incisions. With use of the bikini incision, patients had lower rates of severe HO, but mostly senior surgeons with more experience performed their surgery. Age, ASA grade, experience level of the surgeon, and Brooker grade-4 HO all had a significant influence on PROs. Clinically important HO (Brooker grade 4) remains rare after DAA-THR.

This study aims to investigate the function and mechanism of circMYBL2 in paclitaxel (PTX) resistance of cervical cancer (CC). The expression of circMYBL2, miR-665 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was investigated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Cell viability, cell colony number, cell proliferation, apoptosis and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were detected by 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, colony formation, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation, flow cytometry and LDH release assays, respectively. The interaction between miR-665 and circMYBL2 or EGFR was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The protein expression levels were quantified by western blot or immunohistochemistry assay. Mice xenograft models were constructed to investigate the effect of circMYBL2 on CC tumor growth. CircMYBL2 was upregulated in CC tissues and cells, especially in PTX-resistant CC tissues and cells, and it was a stable circRNA mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. CircMYBL2 could enhance the PTX resistance of CC cells in vitro and promote CC tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, circMYBL2 could inhibit the PTX sensitivity and promote cell malignant behaviors in PTX-sensitive and PTX-resistant CC cells via upregulating EGFR mediated by miR-665. CircMYBL2 played a positive role in the PTX resistance and malignant activities of PTX-sensitive and PTX-resistant CC cells by regulating the miR-665/EGFR network, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CC patients resistant to PTX.","Dong, Mingqiang; Li, Peng; Xie, Yuquan; Wang, Zhihua; Wang, Rui",Drug dev. res,183,1

Considering the escalation in number of cases, mankind is facing a myriad of psychological problems, ranging from those related to taking precautions and maintaining safety to the ones caused by separation and bereavement. The current study aims to explore whether there is a significant difference between individuals with excellent, good, fair and vague knowledge of COVID-19 with respect to depression, anxiety, stress, level of mindfulness, specific cognitive emotion regulation strategies and psychological flexibility; to find out whether there is any significant relationship among these variables; and to determine whether knowledge of COVID-19, level of mindfulness, specific cognitive emotion regulation strategies and psychological flexibility are significant predictors of depression, anxiety and stress in the sample of the current study. The sample consisted of 402 individuals selected from the community following the research criteria. Data was collected using digital consent form, information schedule and questionnaires, from 3rd May to 13th May, 2020. The questionnaires consisted of a semi-structured interview schedule to assess knowledge of COVID-19, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21, Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form, Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire-Short version and Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II. The data was statistically analyzed using analysis of variance test, correlational analysis and linear regression. The findings show that significant differences were present among individuals having varying degrees of knowledge of COVID-19 with respect to anxiety, level of mindfulness and psychological flexibility. Significant relationships were found to be present among the variables of the present study, having differing trends brought forward by the COVID-19 crisis. Certain socio-demographic characteristics and study variables were found to significantly predict the existing levels of depression, anxiety and stress in the current sample.

A meta-analysis to evaluate the mortality in patients with PPFs managed during the current COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of all published studies were conducted with a search on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases using appropriate keywords from January 01, 2020 to January 29, 2021. Results: 35 relevant studies reporting 4255 patients with hip fracture in the current ongoing pandemic, out of which 692 patients were COVID-19 positive. Twenty studies reported mortality and other relevant statistics on hip fracture patients with and without COVID-19 (4123 hip fracture patients in the year 2020-21, out of which 560 had or were suspected of having COVID -19). A meta-analysis of mortality statistics in patients with and without COVID revealed increased odds of mortality among COVID patients [odds ratio (OR) 6.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) [5.09, 7.83] and meta-analysis on the subgroup of surgically treated patients also showed markedly increased mortality risk among those with COVID-19 (OR) 5.99, 95% CI [3.88,9.24]. Conclusion: The mortality risk is markedly increased in hip fracture with concomitant COVID-19 as compared to those without it. This increased risk persisted in those managed surgically. It could be due to the inflammation induced by the fracture or surgery for fracture fixation, further exacerbating inflammation, leading to cytokine storm. It is imperative that such patients are informed regarding increased mortality risk during the consent and shared decision-making process.","Patralekh, M. K.; Jain, V. K.; Iyengar, K.

Most of these patients were elderly and had hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and other underlying health conditions prior to admission for COVID-19. Liver injury occurred in all seven cases during the course of the disease. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels initially increased (1.2-times to 2.0-times the normal value, respectively) in the second week. The liver function recovered in all patients within one week of conventional liver protection treatment. Elevated serum transaminase levels in these patients were due to the COVID-19 infection but could also be related to systemic immune response caused by cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) and hepatocyte damage caused by ischemia and hypoxia. COVID-19 is highly infectious and mainly affects the lungs. In some cases, especially in patients with severe disease type, COVID-19 may also cause liver injury. The liver function of patients with severe COVID-19 should be very carefully monitored, especially if the patients are elderly and have underlying comorbidities.","Li, X; Zhang, Z-C; Zhang, P-L",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,183,33

The effects of these measures are still unclear. Thus, in this study, we investigate changes in travel patterns in response to the COVID-19 outbreak and related policy measures in Japan using longitudinal aggregated mobile phone data. Specifically, we consider daily travel patterns as networks and analyze their structural changes by applying a framework for analyzing temporal networks used in network science. The cluster analysis with the network similarity measures across different dates showed that there are six main types of mobility patterns in the three major metropolitan areas of Japan: (I) weekends and holidays prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, (II) weekdays prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, (III) weekends and holidays before and after the SOE, (IV) weekdays before and after the SOE, (V) weekends and holidays during the SOE, and (VI) weekdays during the SOE. It was also found that travel patterns might have started to change from March 2020, when most schools were closed, and that the mobility patterns after the SOE returned to those prior to the SOE. Interestingly, we found that after the lifting of the SOE, travel patterns remained similar to those during the SOE for a few days, suggesting the possibility that self-restraint continued after the lifting of the SOE. Moreover, in the case of the Nagoya metropolitan area, we found that people voluntarily changed their travel patterns when the number of cases increased.","Dantsuji, Takao; Sugishita, Kashin; Fukuda, Daisuke",,183,16

Lycopene (LYC) has been used as a dietary supplement that has effective antioxidant and anti-obesity functions. The present goal was to understand the molecular mechanisms of LYC preventing DEHP-induced lipid metabolism of liver. The mice were intragastrically administered with LYC (5 mg/kg) and/or DEHP (500 mg/kg or 1000 mg/kg). Here, we found that LYC attenuated DEHP-caused hepatic histopathological lesions including steatosis. Hematological and biochemical analyses revealed that LYC ameliorated DEHP-caused liver function and lipid metabolism disorders. DEHP caused lipid metabolism disorders via activating the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor &#945;/Î³ (PPAR&#945;/Î³) signal transducer and Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)/Liver X receptor (LXR) signaling pathway. As a major regulator of lipid metabolism, Hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;) system was elevated with increased fatty degeneration under DEHP exposure. However, LYC could decrease the levels of HIF-1&#945;/PPAR&#945;/PPARÎ³/FXR/LXR signaling pathway related factors.

Currently, there are 2 types of diagnostic tests available for the detection of SARS-CoV-2: (1) molecular and (2) serological tests. Molecular detection of nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) sequences relating to the suspected pathogen is indicative of an active infection with the suspected pathogen. Serological tests detect antibodies against the suspected pathogen, which are produced by an individual's immune system. A positive serological test result indicates recent exposure to the suspected pathogen but cannot be used to determine if the individual is actively infected with the pathogen or immune to reinfection. In this article, the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests currently approved by the FDA under EUA are reviewed, and other diagnostic tests that researchers are developing to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection are discussed.","Ching, Lauren; Chang, Sandra P; Nerurkar, Vivek R",Hawaii J Health Soc Welf,183,21

These results indicate that changes in gut microbiota composition might contribute to SARS-CoV-2-induced production of inflammatory cytokines in the intestine and potentially also to the onset of a cytokine storm.","Tao, Wanyin; Zhang, Guorong; Wang, Xiaofang; Guo, Meng; Zeng, Weihong; Xu, Zhihao; Cao, Dan; Pan, Aijun; Wang, Yucai; Zhang, Kaiguang; Ma, Xiaoling; Chen, Zhengxu; Jin, Tengchuan; Liu, Lianxin; Weng, Jianping; Zhu, Shu",Med Microecol,183,20

At the same time, a variety of functional autoantibodies have been observed in individuals with severe COVID-19, where they likely contribute to immunopathology. Here, we aimed to determine the extent to which autoantibodies might target NETs in COVID-19 and, if detected, to elucidate their potential functions and clinical associations. We measured anti-NET antibodies in 328 individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 alongside 48 healthy controls. We found high anti-NET activity in the IgG and IgM fractions of 27% and 60% of patients, respectively. There was a strong correlation between anti-NET IgG and anti-NET IgM. Both anti-NET IgG and anti-NET IgM tracked with high levels of circulating NETs, impaired oxygenation efficiency, and high circulating D-dimer. Furthermore, patients who required mechanical ventilation had a greater burden of anti-NET antibodies than did those not requiring oxygen supplementation. Levels of anti-NET IgG (and, to a lesser extent, anti-NET IgM) demonstrated an inverse correlation with the efficiency of NET degradation by COVID-19 sera. Furthermore, purified IgG from COVID-19 sera with high levels of anti-NET antibodies impaired the ability of healthy control serum to degrade NETs. In summary, many individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 have anti-NET antibodies, which likely impair NET clearance and may potentiate SARS-CoV-2-mediated thromboinflammation.","Zuo, Yu; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Navaz, Sherwin A; Hoy, Claire K; Harbaugh, Alyssa; Gockman, Kelsey; Zuo, Melanie; Madison, Jacqueline A; Shi, Hui; Kanthi, Yogendra; Knight, Jason S",JCI insight,183,33

Small molecules can possibly prevent the spreading infection by targeting specific vital components of the viral genome. Non-structural protein 15 (Nsp15) has emerged as a promising target for such inhibitor molecules. In this investigation, we docked bioactive molecules of tea onto the active site of Nsp15. Based on their docking scores, top three molecules (Barrigenol, Kaempferol, and Myricetin) were selected and their conformational behavior was analyzed via molecular dynamics simulations and MMPBSA calculations. The results indicated that the protein had well adapted the ligands in the binding pocket thereby forming stable complexes. These molecules displayed low binding energy during MMPBSA calculations, substantiating their strong association with Nsp15. The inhibitory potential of these molecules could further be examined by in-vivo and in-vitro investigations to validate their use as inhibitors against Nsp15 of SARS-CoV2.","Sharma, Jatin; Kumar Bhardwaj, Vijay; Singh, Rahul; Rajendran, Vidya; Purohit, Rituraj; Kumar, Sanjay",Food Chem,183,0

Delivery of optimal paediatric care is predicated on the availability of comprehensive, high quality, clinical evidence in a relevant population. However, over 80% of current clinical guidelines and bedside decisions are not based on direct high-level evidence. Integration of research activities into routine clinical care is paramount to address this shortfall. Active engagement of patients, families and hospital administrations is required to reframe integrated clinical trials as a tenet of quality health-care delivery. Current research funding in health care is 1-2 orders of magnitude below that of other industries. At an institutional level, investment in research should be prioritised with enhanced funding and supportive policies.

We have developed a smartphone app that collects smartwatch and activity tracker data, as well as self-reported symptoms and diagnostic testing results, from individuals in the United States, and have assessed whether symptom and sensor data can differentiate COVID-19 positive versus negative cases in symptomatic individuals. We enrolled 30,529 participants between 25 March and 7 June 2020, of whom 3,811 reported symptoms. Of these symptomatic individuals, 54 reported testing positive and 279 negative for COVID-19. We found that a combination of symptom and sensor data resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 (interquartile range (IQR): 0.73-0.86) for discriminating between symptomatic individuals who were positive or negative for COVID-19, a performance that is significantly better (P < 0.01) than a model1 that considers symptoms alone (AUC = 0.71; IQR: 0.63-0.79).

Recent national surveys in the United States and Australia have highlighted the need for enhanced home dialysis knowledge especially among nephrologists who have recently completed training. Traditional in-person continuing professional educational programmes have had modest success in promoting home dialysis and are limited by scale and the present global COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesize that the use of a 'Hub and Spoke' model of virtual home dialysis mentorship for nephrologists based on project ECHO would support home dialysis growth.

However, individuals are not used to tracking the required 6-feet (2-meters) distance between themselves and their surroundings. An active surveillance system capable of detecting distances between individuals and warning them can slow down the spread of the deadly disease. Furthermore, measuring social density in a region of interest (ROI) and modulating inflow can decrease social distancing violation occurrence chance. On the other hand, recording data and labeling individuals who do not follow the measures will breach individuals' rights in free-societies. Here we propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based real-time social distancing detection and warning system considering four important ethical factors: (1) the system should never record/cache data, (2) the warnings should not target the individuals, (3) no human supervisor should be in the detection/warning loop, and (4) the code should be open-source and accessible to the public. Against this backdrop, we propose using a monocular camera and deep learning-based real-time object detectors to measure social distancing. If a violation is detected, a non-intrusive audio-visual warning signal is emitted without targeting the individual who breached the social distancing measure. Also, if the social density is over a critical value, the system sends a control signal to modulate inflow into the ROI. We tested the proposed method across real-world datasets to measure its generality and performance. The proposed method is ready for deployment, and our code is open-sourced.","Yang, Dongfang; Yurtsever, Ekim; Renganathan, Vishnu; Redmill, Keith A.; Ozguner, Umit",,183,16

Infection control precautions for hospital visitors are needed to avoid cluster outbreaks, so this study investigated the visiting policies of all the hospitals in Taiwan in the time of COVID-19. METHODS: From March 15, 2020, to March 18, 2020, we searched the official websites of all 472 National Health Insurance-contracted hospitals to determine their visiting policies. For those hospitals that had posted new visiting policies and still allowed visits to ordinary wards, we recorded the relevant details shown on their websites, including the number of visitors allowed at one time, the number of visiting slots per day, the total visiting hours per day, and the rules provided to visitors before visiting. RESULTS: During the study period, 276 (58.5%) hospitals had posted new visiting policies on their websites, with higher proportions of academic medical centers (92.0%, 23/25) and metropolitan hospitals (91.5%, 75/82) than local community hospitals (48.8%, 178/365) doing so. Visits to ordinary wards were forbidden in 83 hospitals among those. Among the 193 hospitals that had new visiting policies and still allowed visits to ordinary wards, 73.1% (n = 141) restricted visitors to two at a time and 54.9% (n = 106) restricted visits to two visiting slots per day. Furthermore, history taking regarding travel, occupation, contacts, and cluster information was mentioned by 82.4% (n = 159) of these 193 hospitals, body temperature monitoring by 78.2% (n = 151), hand hygiene by 63.2% (n = 122), and identity checks by 51.8% (n = 100). CONCLUSION: In the time of COVID-19 covered by this study, about three-fifths of the hospitals in Taiwan had posted their visiting policies for ordinary wards on their websites. Furthermore, the thoroughness with which such visiting policies have been enforced also requires investigation.","Liu, Ya-An; Hsu, Ya-Chuan; Lin, Ming-Hwai; Chang, Hsiao-Ting; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Chou, Li-Fang; Hwang, Shinn-Jang",J Chin Med Assoc,183,20

Major tasks are defined in the federal laws for the public health service emphasizing different types of activities in daycare units, schools, and community living environments. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the activities of the KJGD have clearly changed. This article will provide a review of these tasks during the pandemic on the basis of interviews with KJGD administrations in 11 communities of the federal state North Rhine-Westphalia in October 2020.Typically, the KJGD is deeply involved in infection prevention in daycare facilities and schools by providing contact tracing, swab collection, guidance, crisis committee participation, quarantine survey, and data capture. The classic tasks had to be entirely discontinued in some areas, or at least strongly limited. The affected areas include occupational medicine, medical reports, school entry examinations for children, assessment of special education needs, health reporting, cooperation with child protection and early intervention, outbreak management for other infectious diseases, and the closing of immunization gaps.The consequences of discontinuing the original tasks, e.g., missing school entry examinations, cannot be predicted; resumption of these activities is essential. On behalf of municipal services of general interest in the sense of public health (in all policies), the KJGD makes a remarkable contribution to ensuring that children and youths not only stay physically healthy and far from infections but are also promoted in their individual development and participation.","Horacek, Ulrike; Auer, Isabel; Thaiss, Heidrun",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,183,1

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of lockdown on physical activity and sedentary behaviour. METHODS: A total of 1565 Dutch CVD patients participated in this prospective cohort study, in which we compared physical activity and sedentary behaviour before and during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Baseline measures were assessed in 2018 and data on follow-up measures were collected between 17 and 24 April 2020 (5 weeks after the introduction of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions). Validated questionnaires were used to assess physical activity and sedentary behaviour. RESULTS: Moderate-to-vigorous physical activities increased from 1.6 (0.9, 2.8) to 2.0 (1.0, 3.5)â¯h/day [median (interquartile range)] (pâ¯<â¯0.001) during the COVID-19 lockdown, mainly due to an increase in time spent walking and doing odd jobs. In contrast, time spent exercising significantly declined [1.0 (0.0, 2.3) to 0.0 (0.0, 0.6)â¯h/week], whereas sedentary time increased from 7.8 (6.1, 10.4) to 8.9 (6.8, 11.4)â¯h/day (pâ¯<â¯0.001). The absolute increase in physical activity was 13 (-36, 81) min/day, whereas sedentary behaviour increased by 55 (-72, 186) min/day. CONCLUSION: Despite a small increase in physical activities, the larger increase in sedentary time induced a net reduction in habitual physical activity levels in Dutch CVD patients during the first-wave COVID-19 lockdown. Since a more inactive lifestyle is strongly associated with disease progression and mortality, we encourage CVD patients and their caregivers to explore novel solutions to increase physical activity levels and reduce sedentary time during (and beyond) the COVID-19 pandemic.","van Bakel, B M A; Bakker, E A; de Vries, F; Thijssen, D H J; Eijsvogels, T M H",Neth Heart J,183,24

Here, we report a stepwise protocol for an RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test for rapid and naked-eye molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. The test employs a unique dual-prong approach that integrates nucleic acid (NA) amplification and plasmonic sensing for point-of-care detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with a sample-to-assay response time of <1 h. The RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test utilizes plasmonic gold nanoparticles capped with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) as a colorimetric reporter to detect the amplified nucleic acid from the COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. The ASOs are specific for the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene, and binding of the ASOs to their target sequence results in the aggregation of the plasmonic gold nanoparticles. This highly specific agglomeration step leads to a change in the plasmonic response of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, when tested using clinical samples, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the test were found to be >98.4%, >96.6% and 100%, respectively, with a detection limit of 10 copies/µL. The test can easily be adapted to diagnose other viral infections with a simple modification of the ASOs and primer sequences. It also provides a low-cost, rapid approach requiring minimal instrumentation that can be used as a screening tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at point-of-care settings in resource-poor situations. The colorimetric readout of the test can even be monitored using a handheld optical reader to obtain a quantitative response. Therefore, we anticipate that this protocol will be widely useful for the development of biosensors for the molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.","Alafeef, Maha; Moitra, Parikshit; Dighe, Ketan; Pan, Dipanjan",Nat Protoc,183,22

Evidence from Spain,16.262478,3.3910491,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acceptability of a community health worker (CHW) intervention designed to improve the oral health of low-income, urban Chinese immigrant adults. BACKGROUND: Given that both dental caries and periodontitis are behaviourally mediated, biofilm-based diseases that are largely preventable with attention to regular oral hygiene practices and preventive dental visits, strategies to arrest or even heal carious lesions and high-quality maintenance care and plaque control without the need to resort to aerosol-generating surgical approaches are evidence-based best practices. Older immigrants have poorer oral health than older US-born natives, motivating the need for delivery of more effective and affordable services to this vulnerable population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CHWs were trained by the NYU College of Dentistry dental hygienist faculty members using dental models and flip charts to instruct patients on proper brushing and flossing techniques. In addition, they discussed the presented oral health promotion information one-on-one with patients, addressed any expressed concerns and encouraged prevention of oral conditions through regular dental visits and brushing with fluoride toothpaste. RESULTS: More than 98% of the 74 older Chinese adult participants strongly agreed/agreed that the CHWs helped them to improve how they take care of their health, the CHWs answered their questions and concerns, the information and topics were informative, and the in-person demonstrations were helpful in improving oral health. CONCLUSION: The health of all communities depends on access to comprehensive care, including oral health care, in the wake of COVID-19. CHW interventions are acceptable to and may reach marginalised and immigrant communities.","Northridge, Mary E; Wu, Yinxiang; Troxel, Andrea B; Min, Deborah; Liu, Rong; Liang, Li Juan; Metcalf, Sara S; Seyedzadeh Sabounchi, Shabnam; Yi, Stella",Gerodontology,183,27

Yet, there is little data on factors associated with antibiotic use in these patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, single-center study of all patients below 2 years of age hospitalized between 2014 and 2018. We compared children with RSV infection to children with FLU infection analyzing clinical characteristics and factors contributing to an increased rate of antimicrobial utilization. RESULTS: RSV infection was diagnosed in 476/573 (83.1%), FLU in 95/573 (16.6%), and RSV-FLU-co-infection in 2/573 (0.3%) patients. Median age was lower for RSV compared to FLU (4 vs. 12 months; p < 0.0001). Children with RSV had longer hospitalization (5 vs. 4 days; p = 0.0023) and needed oxygen more frequently (314/476 vs. 23/95; p < 0.0001) than FLU patients. There was no significant difference in the overall antibiotic utilization between RSV and FLU patients (136/476 vs. 21/95; p = 0.2107). Logistic regression analyses revealed that septic appearance on admission (odds ratio [OR] 8.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-54.1), acute otitis media (OR 4.5, 95% CI 2.1-9.4), a longer oxygen therapy (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.13-1.74) and a higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-2.0) were significantly associated with antibiotic use in both groups, but not age or pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, the rate of antibiotic utilization was comparable between RSV and FLU patients, while for both groups distinct clinical presentation and a high CRP value were associated with higher antibiotic use.","Papan, Cihan; Willersinn, Meike; Weiß, Christel; Karremann, Michael; Schroten, Horst; Tenenbaum, Tobias",BMC Infect Dis,183,16

During the last year, autopsy reports have revealed that diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is the most significant observed finding. The aim of this study is to review cases in the literature about COVID-19 autopsies that reported microthrombi in different organs. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review in PubMed, Virtual Health Library (VHL), and Google Scholar. RESULTS: In total, 151 autopsies were included, and 91 cases presented microthrombi in the lung (73%), heart (11.2%), kidney (24%), and liver (16.3%). The age range was between 27 and 96 years. Males were 64.8%. The patients with microthrombi had more comorbidities such as arterial hypertension (62%), obesity or overweight (64%), diabetes mellitus type 2 (51%), and heart disease (53%). The most common histopathological changes found in patients with lung microthrombosis were DAD in exudative phase (78%), pulmonary embolism (59%), and lung infarct (81%). Presence of microthrombi was associated with arterial hypertension (p < 0.0001) and DAD in exudative and proliferative phases (p = 0.02). DISCUSSION: The analysis of these results shows that microthrombi in COVID-19 autopsies may be found in different organs and are more frequent in patients with comorbidities, pulmonary embolism, and lung infarct.","Parra-Medina, Rafael; Herrera, Sabrina; Mejia, Jaime",Acta Haematol,183,12

IgG of high avidity is established during affinity maturation. Failure to achieve high avidity IgG may result in a lack of protective immunity towards infection and disease. It is known that the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cellular receptor is driven by high affinity. Therefore, it is predictable that protective antibodies towards SARS-CoV-2 should show high affinity/avidity. AVIDITY AFTER SARS-COV-2 INFECTION: Recent findings by several groups demonstrate that the serological response towards infection with SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses is characterized by incomplete avidity maturation, followed by a decline of the serological response. This response might facilitate reinfection, prevent herd immunity and potentially allow repeated cycles of infection. CONSEQUENCES FOR VACCINATION TOWARDS SARS-COV-2: Therefore, the sole focus on antibody titers reached after vaccination towards SARS-CoV-2 might not be sufficient to evaluate the degree of achieved protection. Rather, it is suggested to include avidity determination to optimize vaccination protocols and achieve high avidity IgG directed towards SARS-CoV-2 through vaccination. Avidity determination might also be useful to control for truly protective immunity towards SARS-CoV-2 in individual cases.","Bauer, Georg",Int J Infect Dis,183,22

Detecting COVID-19 at early stage is essential to deliver proper healthcare to the patients and also to protect the uninfected population. To this end, we develop a dual-sampling attention network to automatically diagnose COVID- 19 from the community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in chest computed tomography (CT). In particular, we propose a novel online attention module with a 3D convolutional network (CNN) to focus on the infection regions in lungs when making decisions of diagnoses. Note that there exists imbalanced distribution of the sizes of the infection regions between COVID-19 and CAP, partially due to fast progress of COVID-19 after symptom onset. Therefore, we develop a dual-sampling strategy to mitigate the imbalanced learning. Our method is evaluated (to our best knowledge) upon the largest multi-center CT data for COVID-19 from 8 hospitals. In the training-validation stage, we collect 2186 CT scans from 1588 patients for a 5-fold cross-validation. In the testing stage, we employ another independent large-scale testing dataset including 2796 CT scans from 2057 patients. Results show that our algorithm can identify the COVID-19 images with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.944, accuracy of 87.5%, sensitivity of 86.9%, specificity of 90.1%, and F1-score of 82.0%.

In mutant Haloferax strains with enhanced self-targeting, cell fitness decreases and microhomology-mediated end joining becomes active, generating deletions in the targeted gene. Here we use self-targeting to investigate adaptation in H. volcanii CRISPR-Cas type I-B. We show that self-targeting and genome breakage events that are induced by self-targeting, such as those catalysed by active transposases, can generate DNA fragments that are used by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation machinery for integration into the CRISPR loci. Low cellular concentrations of self-targeting crRNAs resulted in acquisition of large numbers of spacers originating from the entire genomic DNA. In contrast, high concentrations of self-targeting crRNAs resulted in lower acquisition that was mostly centred around the targeting site. Furthermore, we observed naïve spacer acquisition at a low level in wild type Haloferax cells and with higher efficiency upon overexpression of the Cas proteins Cas1, Cas2 and Cas4. Taken together these findings indicate that naïve adaptation is a regulated process in H. volcanii that operates at low basal levels and is induced by DNA breaks.","Stachler, Aris-Edda; Wörtz, Julia; Alkhnbashi, Omer S; Turgeman-Grott, Israela; Smith, Rachel; Allers, Thorsten; Backofen, Rolf; Gophna, Uri; Marchfelder, Anita",J. biol. chem,183,16

Peak SARS-CoV-2 viral loads occurred around day 2 of illness in infected children. Although we were unable to directly demonstrate infectivity, the detection of significant amount of virus in the upper airway of asymptomatic children suggest that they have the potential to shed and transmit SARS-CoV-2. Our study highlights the importance of contact tracing and screening for SARS-CoV-2 in children with epidemiological risk factors regardless of their symptom status, in order to improve containment of the virus in the community, including educational settings.","Kam, K Q; Thoon, K C; Maiwald, M; Chong, C Y; Soong, H Y; Loo, L H; Tan, N W H; Li, J; Nadua, K D; Yung, C F",Epidemiol Infect,183,28

In addition, advances in digital technologies provide new opportunities to address limitations of drug-based treatments, such as medication non-adherence, adverse effects, toxicity, drug resistance, drug shortages, affordability, and accessibility. Pharmaceutical drugs and biologics can be combined with digital health technologies, including mobile medical apps (digital therapeutics), which offer additional clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness. Promises of drug+digital combination therapies are recognized by pharmaceutical and digital health companies, opening opportunities for integrating pharmacotherapies with non-pharmacological interventions (metapharmacology). Herein we present unique features of digital health technologies which can deliver personalized self-care modalities such as breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, yoga, physical activity, adequate sleep, listening to preferred music, forgiveness and gratitude. Clinical studies reveal how aforementioned complimentary practices may support treatments of epilepsy, chronic pain, depression, cancer, and other chronic diseases. This article also describes how digital therapies delivering ""medicinal"" self-care and other non-pharmacological interventions can also be personalized by accounting for: 1) genetic risks for comorbidities, 2) adverse childhood experiences, 3) increased risks for viral infections such as seasonal influenza, or COVID-19, and 4) just-in-time stressful and traumatic circumstances. Development and implementation of personalized pharmacological-behavioral combination therapies (precision metapharmacology) require aligning priorities of key stakeholders including patients, research communities, healthcare industry, regulatory and funding agencies. In conclusion, digital technologies enable integration of pharmacotherapies with self-care, lifestyle interventions and patient empowerment, while concurrently advancing patient-centered care, integrative medicine and digital health ecosystems.","Bulaj, G.; Clark, J.; Ebrahimi, M.; Bald, E.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,183,30

RESULTS: A total of 80 patients received 354 RBC units, 116 plasma units, and 48 platelet units. Median age was 71 years (IQR: 62-76), and 59 (74%) were males. In total, 138 of the 261 transfusion episodes that involved RBCs (59%) were related to spontaneous (n=94) or procedure-related (n=44) bleeding. Spontaneous bleeding was more frequent in the retroperitoneal space and the gastrointestinal apparatus. Tracheostomy with endotracheal intubation, surgical interventions, and cannulation of femoral vessels were the main procedures behind non-spontaneous bleeding. Most patients (91%) were on anticoagulants, mostly intermediate- or full-dose heparin.

Various anticoagulation strategies have been evaluated in hospitalized patients to prevent complications. The impact of chronic anticoagulation before SARS-CoV-2 infection on the risk for subsequent thrombosis has not been systematically studied. METHODS: This was a retrospective single-center study. All patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing from March 13, 2020, through May 6, 2020, at the University of Rochester Medical Center were identified. We included all patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 1 month before COVID diagnosis. We documented the rate of thrombotic complications, type of anticoagulation, bleeding complications, and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 107 SARS-CoV2-infected patients were chronically anticoagulated before SARS-CoV-2 testing with a median age of 78. Of those, 42 required hospital admission, with 17 requiring intensive care. No patients, inpatient or outpatient, were diagnosed with a new symptomatic thrombotic complication. Three patients had minor bleeding in the hospital. Thirteen (12%) patients died (69% male). CONCLUSION: Our uncontrolled findings suggest that chronic anticoagulation at the time of infection may protect against thrombotic complications and decrease disease severity.","Lachant, Daniel J; Lachant, Neil A; Kouides, Peter; Rappaport, Stephen; Prasad, Paritosh; White, R James",J Thromb Haemost,183,19

COVID pandemic has added to the list of infectious agents that could result in arthritis. Materials and Methods: The retrospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care centre. The study included patients who presented with clinical suspicion of post-infectious arthritis between July-September 2019 and 2020. The study was extended for another 2 months to include patients who presented between October-November 2020. The patients were categorized into post-viral arthritis, post-COVID arthritis, chikungunya arthritis and AIRDs. The demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, examination findings and laboratory parameters and the response to treatment for each participant were collected and assessed. Results: In the year 2019 and 2020 (July-Sep), the corresponding number of patients analyzed were 20 and 33. The mean duration of presentation was 1.53 (±3.10) weeks. Chikungunya arthritis was noted in 10% of patients in 2019, while it was 15.15% in 2020. Other post-viral arthritis was identified in 65% and 66.67% of patients in 2019 and 2020 respectively. In the second part of the study, 65.68% of patients were classified as post-viral arthritis, including chikungunya arthritis, post-COVID arthritis and other post-viral arthritis. Around 27% were categorized as AIRDs. Rheumatoid factor negativity and anti-nuclear antibody negativity were found to be significant (P 0.0) in categorizing the patients into post-viral arthritis group, while presence of urinary symptoms (P 0.0) classified the patients into reactive arthritis. Conclusion: The study revealed that the presence of chikungunya arthritis across the two years was comparable. Post-COVID arthritis needs to be considered as a potential differential in post-infectious arthritis. There are no identifiable characteristics (clinical or a simple routine laboratory parameter) that could differentiate the causes of post-infectious arthritis from AIRDs. © 2021 Journal of Association of Physicians of India.

It is unclear how much of the ischaemic damage is mediated by direct or inflammatory effects of virus on the CNS vasculature and how much is secondary to extracranial cardiorespiratory disease. Limited data suggest that the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus may enter the CNS via the nasal mucosa and olfactory fibres, or by haematogenous spread, and is capable of infecting endothelial cells, pericytes and probably neurons. Extracranially, SARS-CoV-2 targets endothelial cells and pericytes, causing endothelial cell dysfunction, vascular leakage and immune activation, sometimes leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation. It remains to be confirmed whether endothelial cells and pericytes in the cerebral vasculature are similarly targeted. Several aspects of COVID-19 are likely to impact on cognition. Cerebral white matter is particularly vulnerable to ischaemic damage in COVID-19 and is also critically important for cognitive function. There is accumulating evidence that cerebral hypoperfusion accelerates amyloid-ß (Aß) accumulation and is linked to tau and TDP-43 pathology, and by inducing phosphorylation of &#945;-synuclein at serine-129, ischaemia may also increase the risk of development of Lewy body disease. Current therapies for COVID-19 are understandably focused on supporting respiratory function, preventing thrombosis and reducing immune activation. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are predicted to increase ACE-2 expression, it was initially feared that their use might exacerbate COVID-19. Recent meta-analyses have instead suggested that these medications are protective. This is perhaps because SARS-CoV-2 entry may deplete ACE-2, tipping the balance towards angiotensin II-ACE-1-mediated classical RAS activation: exacerbating hypoperfusion and promoting inflammation. It may be relevant that APOE Îµ4 individuals, who seem to be at increased risk of COVID-19, also have lowest ACE-2 activity. COVID-19 is likely to leave an unexpected legacy of long-term neurological complications in a significant number of survivors. Cognitive follow-up of COVID-19 patients will be important, especially in patients who develop cerebrovascular and neurological complications during the acute illness.","Miners, Scott; Kehoe, Patrick G; Love, Seth",Alzheimers Res Ther,183,1

Using data collected from a rapid survey led by the National Institute of Statistics, on a sample of 1,310 respondents from April to May 2020. These data show that a large proportion of workers suffered a wage cut (60.93%) and temporary job suspension (31.6%), and the smallest proportion suffered job loss (7.47%). The results of the logistic regression show that lower frequency of outgoings to work, difficulties in accessing transport services and the loss of customer confidence have a strong negative impact on both wage cuts and temporary suspensions of work. The closure (total or partial) of activities has increasingly enhanced job loss. Further, the log of odds show that workers in private firms are more affected than their peers in public firms, and the middle-aged are the most affected group. So, it is recommended to revamp the old methods of activity into digital innovation that enables less physical touch and find an appropriate way to support those who have lost their jobs during this Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in the private sector.","Djoumessi, Yannick Fosso",African development review,183,1

The impact on their participation in movement behaviours (physical activity, sedentary screen time and sleep) is unknown. This international longitudinal study compared young children's movement behaviours before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Parents of children aged 3-5 years, from 14 countries (8 low- and middle-income countries, LMICs) completed surveys to assess changes in movement behaviours and how these changes were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys were completed in the 12 months up to March 2020 and again between May and June 2020 (at the height of restrictions). Physical activity (PA), sedentary screen time (SST) and sleep were assessed via parent survey. At Time 2, COVID-19 factors including level of restriction, environmental conditions, and parental stress were measured. Compliance with the World Health Organizations (WHO) Global guidelines for PA (180 min/day [&#8805;60 min moderate- vigorous PA]), SST (&#8804;1 h/day) and sleep (10-13 h/day) for children under 5 years of age, was determined. RESULTS: Nine hundred- forty-eight parents completed the survey at both time points. Children from LMICs were more likely to meet the PA (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AdjOR] = 2.0, 95%Confidence Interval [CI] 1.0,3.8) and SST (AdjOR = 2.2, 95%CI 1.2,3.9) guidelines than their high-income country (HIC) counterparts. Children who could go outside during COVID-19 were more likely to meet all WHO Global guidelines (AdjOR = 3.3, 95%CI 1.1,9.8) than those who were not.

However, the data describing the global prevalence of liver injury associated with COVID-19 is lacking secondary to the novelty of this ongoing pandemic. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the association between COVID-19 and liver injury. METHODS: A systematic literature search of indexed databases including, PubMed, Medline, and Embase databases from inception to 14 April 2020, was used to identify studies that reported data of liver chemistry in patients diagnosed with COVID 19. The overall prevalence of abnormal liver chemistry and relevant 95% confidence interval was used to estimate the pooled results studies. RESULTS: Sixty-four studies with 11 245 patients with COVID-19 were included. The pattern of abnormal liver enzymes was notable for higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. The overall global prevalence of elevated AST, ALT, total bilirubin, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase was 23.2, 21.2, 9.7, 15.0, and 4.0%, respectively. The prevalence of elevated AST was substantially higher among those with severe cases (45.5%) compared to non-severe cases (15.0%). Co-existing chronic liver disease presented up to 37.6% of patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: A fourth of COVID-19 patients had elevated liver enzymes and associated with disease severity. Our study may be used as a guide for clinicians and epidemiologists to proactively identify other sources of injury and illness in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Intensive monitoring for liver injury may be needed in cases with severe COVID-19.","Wijarnpreecha, Karn; Ungprasert, Patompong; Panjawatanan, Panadeekarn; Harnois, Denise M; Zaver, Himesh B; Ahmed, Aijaz; Kim, Donghee",Eur. j. gastroenterol. hepatol,183,5

We show that the choice of the scale adopted on these graphs has important consequences on how people understand and react to the information conveyed. In particular, we find that when we show the number of COVID-19 related deaths on a logarithmic scale, people have a less accurate understanding of how the pandemic has developed, make less accurate predictions on its evolution, and have different policy preferences than when they are exposed to a linear scale. Consequently, merely changing the scale the data is presented on can alter public policy preferences and the level of worry about the pandemic, despite the fact that people are routinely exposed to COVID-19 related information. Providing the public with information in ways they understand better can help improving the response to COVID-19, thus, mass media and policymakers communicating to the general public should always describe the evolution of the pandemic using a graph on a linear scale, at least as a default option.

Assessment and treatment of COVID-19 associated hyperinflammation may be key to improve outcomes. It was speculated that in subgroups of patients secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) or cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with features of macrophage activation syndrome might drive severe disease trajectories. If confirmed, profound immunosuppressive therapy would be a rationale treatment approach. Over a median observation period of 11 (IQR: 8; 16) days, 19 consecutive confirmed severe COVID-19-patients admitted to our intensive-care-unit were tested for presence of sHLH by two independent experts. HScores and 2004-HLH diagnostic criteria were assessed. Patients were grouped according to short-term clinical courses: discharge from ICU versus ongoing ARDS or death at time of analysis. The median HScore at admission was 157 (IQR: 98;180), without the key clinical triad of HLH, i.e. progressive cytopenia, persistent fever and organomegaly. Independent expert chart review revealed the absence of sHLH in all cases. No patient reached more than 3/6 of modified HLH 2004 criteria. Nevertheless, patients presented hyperinflammation with peripheral neutrophilic signatures (neutrophil/lymphocyte-ratio > 3.5). The latter best paralleled their short-term clinical courses, with declining relative neutrophil numbers prior to extubation (4.4, [IQR: 2.5;6.3]; n = 8) versus those with unfavourable courses (7.6, [IQR: 5.2;31], n = 9). Our study rules out virus induced sHLH as the leading cause of most severe-COVID-19 trajectories. Instead, an associated innate neutrophilic hyperinflammatory response or virus-associated-CRS appears dominant in patients with an unfavourable clinical course. Therapeutic implications are discussed.","Lorenz, Georg; Moog, Philipp; Bachmann, Quirin; La Rosée, Paul; Schneider, Heike; Schlegl, Michaela; Spinner, Christoph; Heemann, Uwe; Schmid, Roland M; Algül, Hana; Lahmer, Tobias; Huber, Wolfgang; Schmaderer, Christoph",Sci Rep,183,16

METHODS: Retrospective review was performed to identify intensive care unit (ICU) patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 with computed tomography (CT) between March 20 and December 31, 2020. ICU patients without COVID-19 diagnosis with CT between March 20 and May 10, 2020 were also identified. CT image findings of colitis or terminal ileitis as well as supportive treatment including ventilator, vasopressors, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed to determine if clinical factors differed in patients with and without positive CT finding. RESULTS: Total 61 ICU patients were selected, including 32 (52%) COVID-19-positive patients and 29 (48%) non-COVID-19 patients. CT findings of colitis or terminal ileitis were identified in 27 patients (44%). Seventy-four percent of the patients with positive CT findings (20/27) received supportive therapies prior to CT, while 56% of the patients without abnormal CT findings (19/34) received supportive therapies. Vasopressor treatment was significantly associated with development of colitis and/or terminal ileitis (p = 0.04) and COVID-19 status was not significantly different between these groups (p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, there was significant correlation between prior vasopressor therapy and imaging findings of colitis or terminal ileitis in ICU patients, independent of COVID-19 status. Our observation raises a possibility that the reported COVID-19-related severe gastrointestinal complications and potential poor outcome could have been confounded by underlying severe critically ill status, and warrants a caution in diagnosis of gastrointestinal complication.","Martin, Sooyoung; Pierce, Jonathan; Kikano, Elias G; Vos, Derek; Tirumani, Sree Harsha; Ramaiya, Nikhil",Emerg. radiol,183,15

Thrombotic complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease and/or traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and advanced age, are at the highest risk of death from COVID-19. In this Review, we summarize new lines of evidence that point to both platelet and endothelial dysfunction as essential components of COVID-19 pathology and describe the mechanisms that might account for the contribution of cardiovascular risk factors to the most severe outcomes in COVID-19. We highlight the distinct contributions of coagulopathy, thrombocytopathy and endotheliopathy to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and discuss potential therapeutic strategies in the management of patients with COVD-19. Harnessing the expertise of the biomedical and clinical communities is imperative to expand the available therapeutics beyond anticoagulants and to target both thrombocytopathy and endotheliopathy.

Patients presenting with acute respiratory failure, particularly when tidal volume is restricted during mechanical ventilation, may experience the most distressing form of dyspnea known as air hunger. Air hunger activates brain pathways known to be involved in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. These conditions are considered part of the post-intensive care syndrome. These sequelae may be even more prevalent among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Low tidal volume, a mainstay of modern therapy for ARDS is difficult to avoid and is likely to cause air hunger despite sedation. Adjunctive neuromuscular blockade does not prevent or relieve air hunger, but it does prevent the patient from communicating discomfort to caregivers. Consequently, paralysis may also contribute to the development of PTSD. Although research has identified post-ARDS PTSD as a cause for concern and investigators have taken steps to quantify the burden of disease, there is little information to guide mechanical ventilation strategies designed to reduce its occurrence. We suggest such efforts will be more successful if they are directed at the known mechanisms of air hunger. Investigation of the anti-dyspnea effects of sedative and analgesic drugs commonly used in the ICU and their impact on post-ARDS PTSD symptoms is a logical next step. While in practice we often accept negative consequences of life-saving therapies as unavoidable, we must understand the negative sequalae of our therapies and work to minimize them under our primary directive to ""first, do no harm"" to our patients.","Worsham, Christopher M; Banzett, Robert B; Schwartzstein, Richard",Chest,183,7

METHODS: We retrospectively matched (1:2) critical COVID-19 patients with one or more MDR GNB from any clinical specimen (cases), with those with no MDR GNB isolates (controls). RESULTS: Seventy-eight cases were identified (4.5 per 1000 intensive care unit (ICU) days, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6-5.7). Of 98 MDR GNB isolates, the most frequent species were Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (24, 24.5%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (23, 23.5%). Two (8.7%) K. pneumoniae, and six (85.7%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were carbapenem resistant. A total of 24 (24.5%) isolates were not considered to be associated with active infection. Those with active infection received appropriate antimicrobial agents within a median of one day. The case group had significantly longer median central venous line days, mechanical ventilation days, and hospital length of stay (P<0.001 for each). All-cause mortality at 28 days was not significantly different between the two groups (P=0.19). Mechanical ventilation days (adjusted odds ratio 1.062, 95% CI 1.012-1.114; P=0.015), but not receipt of corticosteroids or tocilizumab, was independently associated with the isolation of MDR GNB. There was no association between MDR GNB and 28-day all-cause mortality (adjusted odds ratio 2.426, 95% CI 0.833-7.069; P= 0.104).

Faces and voices constitute two important sources of information to enable artificial systems to reliably recognize individuals. Deep learning networks have achieved state-of-the-art results and demonstrated to be suitable tools to address such a task. However, when those networks are applied to different and unprecedented scenarios not included in the training set, they can suffer a drop in performance. For example, with robotic platforms in ever-changing and realistic environments, where always new sensory evidence is acquired, the performance of those models degrades. One solution is to make robots learn from their first-hand sensory data with self-supervision. This allows coping with the inherent variability of the data gathered in realistic and interactive contexts. To this aim, we propose a cognitive architecture integrating low-level perceptual processes with a spatial working memory mechanism. The architecture autonomously organizes the robot's sensory experience into a structured dataset suitable for human recognition. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture and show that it is a promising solution in the quest of making robots more autonomous in their learning process.","Gonzalez-Billandon, Jonas; Belgiovine, Giulia; Sciutti, Alessandra; Sandini, Giulio; Rea, Francesco",,183,20

In South Carolina, the spatial and temporal patterns were different, initially concentrating in small towns within metro counties, then diffusing to centralized urban areas and rural areas. When mitigation restrictions were relaxed, hotspots reappeared in the major cities. This paper examines the county-scale spatial and temporal patterns of confirmed cases of COVID-19 for South Carolina from March 1st - September 5th, 2020. We first describe the initial diffusion of the new confirmed cases per week across the state, which remained under 2,000 cases until Memorial Day weekend (epi week 23) then dramatically increased, peaking in mid-July (epi week 29), and slowly declining thereafter. Second, we found significant differences in cases and deaths between urban and rural counties, partially related to the timing of the number of confirmed cases and deaths and the implementation of state and local mitigations. Third, we found that the case rates and mortality rates positively correlated with pre-existing social vulnerability. There was also a negative correlation between mortality rates and county resilience patterns, as expected, suggesting that counties with higher levels of inherent resilience had fewer deaths per 100,000 population.","Huang, Q.; Jackson, S.; Derakhshan, S.; Lee, LoGan Pham E.; Jackson, A.; Cutter, S.

We present a prospective study in COVID-19 patients recruited in our institution. VWF antigen, ADAMTS13 activity, D-dimer, and fibrinogen were measured during the first week once COVID-19 was diagnosed. Fifty COVID-19 inpatients [44% in the intensive care unit (ICU)] and 102 COVID-19 outpatients were enrolled. Thirty age and gender matched non-COVID-19 ward inpatients and 30 non-COVID-19 healthy individuals were recruited. The COVID-19 inpatients had higher D-dimer, fibrinogen, and VWF antigen levels and a lower ADAMTS13 activity compared with the COVID-19 outpatients (p < 0.05). ICU patients had higher D-dimer and VWF antigen levels compared with the ward patients and the lowest ADAMTS13 activity (p < 0.05). An imbalance in VWF antigen/ADAMTS13 ratio was observed in COVID-19, reaching the highest in ICU patients. In contrast to other ward non-COVID-19 inpatients, a significative reduction in ADAMTS13 activity was observed in all COVID-19 patients. There is an increase in VWF antigen and an ADAMTS13 activity reduction in COVID-19 related to disease severity and could predict poor clinical outcomes.

This led some economists to reconsider the taboo on seignorage. Following a brief documentation of the crisis impact and aggregate demand policies responses the paper discusses views of academics and policymakers on seignorage. Optimal taxation considerations imply that the decision on allocating deficit financing between debt and seignorage falls within the realm of fiscal authorities-a fact that infringes on central bank (CB) autonomy. The paper explores ideas aimed at improving the tradeoff between those two principles. Implication of cross-country variations in the need to use seignorage is discussed. Comparison of the indirect contribution of quantitative easing (QE) to deficit financing with the direct contribution of seignorage implies that QE is a substitute to seignorage that preserves central bank dominance without much change in existing monetary institutions. Comparison of empirical evidence from the USA during the global financial crisis with the post-WWI German inflation supports the view that for countries experiencing deflationary pressure seignorage is more potent in moving inflation toward its target than QE. Given the current outlook temporary use of seignorage does not appear to involve a substantial risk of inflation.,"Cukierman, Alex",Comp Econ Stud,183,24

Yet, the transmission dynamics of the disease in these establishments remain unclear. METHODS: Air and no-touch surfaces of 31 rooms from 7 LTCFs were sampled and SARS-CoV-2 was quantified by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: Air samples were negative but viral genomes were recovered from 20 of 62 surface samples at concentrations ranging from 13 to 36,612 genomes/surface. Virus isolation (culture) from surface samples (nâ¯=â¯7) was negative. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of viral RNA on no-touch surfaces is evidence of viral dissemination through air, but the lack of airborne viral particles in air samples suggests that they were not aerosolized in a significant manner during air sampling sessions. The air samples were collected 8 to 30 days after the residents' symptom onset, which could indicate that viruses are aerosolized early in the infection process. Additional research is needed to evaluate viral viability conservation and the potential role of direct contact and aerosols in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in these institutions.","Dumont-Leblond, Nathan; Veillette, Marc; Bhérer, Luc; Boissoneault, Karine; Mubareka, Samira; Yip, Lily; Dubuis, Marie-Eve; Longtin, Yves; Jouvet, Philippe; McGeer, Alison; Duchaine, Caroline",Am. j. infect. control,183,1

Early diagnosis is the milestone in their mitigation, control, and eradication. Many diagnostic techniques are showing great success and have many advantages, such as the rapid turnover of the results, high accuracy, and high specificity and sensitivity. However, some of these techniques have several pitfalls if samples were not collected, processed, and transported in the standard ways and if these techniques were not practiced with extreme caution and precision. This may lead to false-negative/positive results. This may affect the downstream management of the affected cases. These techniques require regular fine-tuning, upgrading, and optimization. The continuous evolution of new strains and viruses belong to the coronaviruses is hampering the success of many classical techniques. There are urgent needs for next generations of coronaviruses diagnostic assays that overcome these pitfalls. This new generation of diagnostic tests should be able to do simultaneous, multiplex, and high-throughput detection of various coronavirus in one reaction. Furthermore, the development of novel assays and techniques that enable the in situ detection of the virus on the environmental samples, especially air, water, and surfaces, should be given considerable attention in the future.

Attempts to contain its spread have entailed varying early screening and triage strategies implemented in different countries and regions. AIM: To share the experience of scientific and standardized management of fever clinics in China, which provide the first effective checkpoint for the prevention and control of COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: A fever clinic was established at our hospital in Tianjin, China, for initially identifying suspected cases of COVID-19 and controlling the spread of the disease. METHODS: The management system covered the following aspects: spatial layout; partitioning of functional zones; a work management system and associated processes; management of personnel, materials and equipment; and patient education. RESULTS: Within two months of introducing these measures, there was a comprehensive reduction in the number of new COVID-19 cases in Tianjin, and zero infections occurred among medical staff at the fever clinic. DISCUSSION: The fever clinic plays an important role in the early detection, isolation and referral of patients presenting with fevers of unknown origin. Broad screening criteria, an adequate warning mechanism, manpower reserves and staff training at the clinic are essential for the early management of epidemics. CONCLUSION: The spread of COVID-19 has been effectively curbed through the establishment of the fever clinic, which merits widespread promotion and application. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICIES: Health managers should be made aware of the important role of fever clinics in the early detection, isolation and referral of patients, and in the treatment of infectious diseases to prevent and control their spread. In the early stage of an epidemic, fever clinics should be established in key areas with concentrated clusters of cases. Simultaneously, the health and safety of health professionals require attention.","Wang, Y; Qiang, W-M; Wang, C; Wu, P-P; Li, M-M; Kong, Q-Q; Yu, L-Y; Chen, L",Int. nurs. rev,183,30

Although its seroprevalence is highly variable among territories, it has been reported at around 10%, but higher in health workers. Evidence regarding cross-neutralizing response between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial. However, other previous coronaviruses may interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection, since they are phylogenetically related and share the same target receptor. Further, the seroconversion of IgM and IgG occurs at around 12 days post onset of symptoms and most patients have neutralizing titers on days 14-20, with great titer variability. Neutralizing antibodies correlate positively with age, male sex, and severity of the disease. Moreover, the use of convalescent plasma has shown controversial results in terms of safety and efficacy, and due to the variable immune response among individuals, measuring antibody titers before transfusion is mostly required. Similarly, cellular immunity seems to be crucial in the resolution of the infection, as SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells circulate to some extent in recovered patients. Of note, the duration of the antibody response has not been well established yet.","Chvatal-Medina, Mateo; Mendez-Cortina, Yorjagis; Patiño, Pablo J; Velilla, Paula A; Rugeles, Maria T",Front Immunol,183,1

Focusing on the conditions in Bali, this study explored the level of compliance to public health measures targeted at COVID-19 and identified the determinants of compliance via the values, rules, and knowledge approach. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study conducted an online survey using the Google Form application from June 29 to July 5, 2020. The minimum required sample size was 664. Inclusion criteria were set as follows: 18 years of age or older and residing in Bali during the data collection period. Adherence was measured based on nine protocol indicators that were rated using a four-point Likert scale. A multiple linear regression analysis was then conducted to determine the associated factors of adherence to public health measures. Results: Of the 954 survey respondents, data from 743 were included for analysis. The average level of adherence to public health measures was 32.59 (range of 20-36). The linear regression analysis showed that perceived health benefits from public health measures, being female, and having COVID-19 test histories were significantly associated with adherence to public health measures. Conclusions: For public health measures targeted at COVID-19, adherence was strongly associated with perceived social norms, in which individuals played social community roles by adapting to standardized public health measures. It is thus imperative for governments to support and monitor public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Indrayathi, Putu Ayu; Januraga, Pande Putu; Pradnyani, Putu Erma; Gesesew, Hailay Abrha; Ward, Paul Russel",Front Public Health,183,31

These operations have become increasingly complex involving multiple revisions, with limited healthy native tissue availability. Grafts are frequently needed when a patient's own tissue is expected to have poor wound-healing properties. To reduce the morbidity associated with autologous grafts and complications associated with synthetic grafts, acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) can be used as substitutes in genitourinary surgery as they demonstrate decreased immunogenicity and retaine structural integrity. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review is to describe the importance and potential uses of ADMs by reviewing the literature and highlighting key examples of our institution's expanded application of ADM grafts in genitourinary reconstruction. METHODS: We performed a literature review for the use of ADMs in genitourinary surgery including the search terms acellular dermal matrix, alloderm, extracellular matrix, penis, penile reconstruction, intrapenile prosthesis, phalloplasty, neophallus, urethroplasty, artificial urinary sphincters, Peyronie's disease, and urology. We highlight 5 representative genitourinary reconstructive cases performed at this institution where ADMs contributed to surgical success. Genitourinary reconstructive surgeries that have used ADMs in the literature included neophallus construction for gender affirmation, phalloplasty for trauma, penile augmentation, and plaque excision and grafting for Peyronie's disease. RESULTS: Biomechanical studies across different graft types are limited in genitourinary applications. Initial studies using ADMs indicate benefits of limited inflammatory response, finite elasticity, and substantial tensile strength, acceptably mimicking properties of the native tissue. CONCLUSION: Our experience and the current literature suggest that human ADM is a valuable option for tunica albuginea replacement, but its use to support free grafts should be cautioned secondary to graft take.

The current state of affairs of the chemical industry as seen in its historical context offers a perspective for the future. The chemical industry developed in the 19th century from efforts to replace naturally occurring materials rubber and ivory. Revisiting nature for inspiration with today's far more advanced chemistry knowledge offers an abundance of opportunities for fundamental research as well as applied technology development with commercial perspectives. Beyond the covalent bond as practiced by synthetic petrochemistry for making a wealth of small-, oligo-, and macro-molecules there exists a vast area, barely explored, of bio-materials with seemingly endless structure-forming capability and functionality. These non-covalent, intermolecular forces working at several length and time scales define functional materials that may offer opportunities to tackle the challenges of sustainability. Such coming from a combination of synthetic polymer chemistry and chemistry inspired by nature form a future path to innovation and sustainable growth. They bring a basis for materials differentiation and renewed competitiveness in the chemical industry.","Koopmans, R J",Soft Matter,183,16

We introduce here our method of emergency endonasal endotracheal intubation under videoendoscopic observation. METHODS: Transnasal endoscopic observation was done, and the region of airway stenosis was detected. Then, the endotracheal tube was prepared and the endoscope was inserted into the tube. The endoscope with tube was inserted up to the larynx. Immediately after the administration of lidocaine to the larynx, the endoscope with tube was inserted to the endolarynx and then to the trachea. The endotracheal tube was tightly held in the nostril, and the endoscope was removed. RESULTS: We have encountered four cases this year. The primary disease developing airway stenosis was acute epiglottitis due to pharyngeal and deep neck abscesses in three cases and laryngeal edema due to Ludwig's angina. All patients underwent uneventful intubation, and dyspnea was immediately ceased. CONCLUSION: In cases showing severe suffocation, the clinician should perform airway maintenance even in an outpatient setting apart from a more monitored setting like the operation room. This technique resembles the usual nasal endoscopic laryngeal observation and is done even in the usual ENT office and/or emergency room. The supine position tends to worsen airway stenosis in patients with upper airway stenosis; however, this technique can be performed in a sitting or semi-sitting position. This method is less invasive for patients and also reduces the risk to the medical staff, especially in this COVID-19 era.","Tsunoda, Atsunobu; Kobayashi, Yuko; Tou, Miri; Sonoda, Kenji; Arai, Shinpei; Anzai, Takashi; Matsumoto, Fumihiko",Am J Otolaryngol,183,26

Attention has focussed on the viral spike protein, but substantial variation has been seen in the ORF8 gene. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein undergoes signal peptide-mediated processing through the endoplasmic reticulum and is secreted as a glycosylated, disulphide-linked dimer. The secreted protein from the prototype SARS-CoV-2 virus had no major effect on viability of a variety of cell types, or on IFN or NF-{kappa}B signalling. However, it modulated cytokine expression from primary CSF1-derived human macrophages, most notably by decreasing IL-6 and IL-8 secretion. Furthermore, a sequence polymorphism L84S that appeared early in the pandemic associated with the Clade S lineage of virus, showed a markedly different effect, of increasing IL-6 production. We conclude that ORF8 sequence polymorphisms can potentially affect SARS-CoV-2 virulence and should therefore be monitored in sequencing-based surveillance.","Kriplani, Nisha; Clohisey, Sara Mary Rose; Fonseca, Sonia; Fletcher, Sarah; Lee, Hui-Min; Ashworth, Jordan; Kurian, Dominic; Lycett, Samantha J; Tait-Burkard, Christine; Baillie, J Kenneth; Woolhouse, Mark E J; Carding, Simon R; Stewart, James P; Digard, Paul",,183,19

Measuring temporal variation in the all-cause mortality sex ratio before and during the pandemic in populations exposed to different constraints on risky behavior would allow us to better anticipate changes in the ratio and to better understand its association with infection control strategies. METHODS: I apply time Box-Jenkins modeling to 262 months of pre-pandemic mortality sex ratios to arrive at counterfactual values of 10 intra-pandemic ratios. I compare counterfactual to observed values to determine if intra-pandemic ratios differed detectably from those expected as well as whether the Norwegian and Swedish differences varied from each other. RESULTS: The male to female mortality sex ratio in both Norway and Sweden increased during the pandemic. I, however, find no evidence that the increase differed between the two countries despite their different COVID-19 containment strategies. CONCLUSION: Societal expectations of who will die during the COVID-19 pandemic will likely be wrong if they assume pre-pandemic mortality sex ratios because the intra-pandemic ratios appear, at least in Norway and Sweden, detectably higher. The contribution of differences in policies to reduce risky behavior to those higher ratios appears, however, small.","Catalano, Ralph",Scand J Public Health,183,26

Evidence from Firm-Level Surveys,16.584177,3.2949457,2020,"BackgroundThere is conflicting evidence about the risk of mortality and severe disease due to COVID-19 in people living with HIV (PLHIV). ObjectivesTo compare mortality, hospitalization, and the need for intensive care services due to COVID-19 between PLHIV and individuals without HIV based on data from the existing literature. MethodsA comprehensive search in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, China Academic Journals Full Text Database, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) and and the medRXIV and bioRxiv databases of preprints was carried out. Each data source was searched from 1 January 2020 to 20th of February 2021. Eligible studies were case control, cross-sectional and cohort studies where participants had confirmed COVID-19. From each study, data on numbers of PLHIV and individuals without HIV for each outcome were extracted. Study quality was assessed using the MethodologicAl STandard for Epidemiological Research (MASTER) scale. Data synthesis used a bias adjusted model and predefined age and geographical subgroups were analysed. ResultsOf a total of 2757 records identified, 11 studies, from 4 countries, the United Kingdom, Spain, the United States of America and South Africa, were included. The total participants assessed for the outcomes in this meta-analysis were 1 268 676 of which 13 886 were PLHIV. Overall, the estimated effect of HIV on mortality suggested some worsening (OR 1.3, 95% CI: 0.9 - 2.0, I2 = 78.6%) with very weak evidence against the model hypothesis at this sample size. However, in individuals aged <60 years, the estimated effect on mortality suggested more worsening in PLHIV (OR 2.7, 95% CI: 1.1 - 6.5, I2 = 95.7%) with strong evidence against the model hypothesis at this sample size. HIV was also associated with an estimated effect on hospitalization for COVID-19 that suggested worsening (OR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-2.1, I2 = 96.0%) also with strong evidence against the model hypothesis at this sample size. A secondary analysis of the included studies suggested no difference, by HIV status, in the prevalence of pre-existing conditions. ConclusionPeople living with HIV have higher risk of death and hospitalisation from COVID-19, compared to individuals without HIV. A secondary analysis suggests this is not due to associated comorbid conditions. The difference in mortality is exaggerated in those younger than 60 years of age. RegistrationPROSPERO: CRD42020221311 (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=221311) Evidence before this studyFindings from existing studies have shown conflicting evidence concerning the risk of severe COVID-19 and death from COVID-19 in people living with HIV (PLHIV) compared to people without HIV. Evidence from three existing systematic reviews suggests that the risk of severe COVID-19 and death from COVID-19 in PLHIV may be similar to that in individuals without HIV. However, findings from three large cohort studies and one meta-analysis of four studies suggest that the risk of death from COVID-19 in PLHIV may be higher than that in individuals without HIV. One of the large cohort studies, which is also included in the previous meta-analysis, consisted of individuals with unknown COVID-19 status, and therefore there is still debate concerning the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in PLHIV. Added value of this studyIn this meta-analysis of 11 studies with 1 268 676 individuals with confirmed COVID-19, we found a stronger difference in mortality by HIV status for those individuals below the age of 60 years, and over this age, HIV had an attenuated effect on mortality, suggesting that age-related mortality overshadows PLHIV related mortality. Further, PLHIV had increased odds of being hospitalized and needing intensive cares services, probably related to increased COVID-19 severity in PLHIV. A secondary analysis of the included studies suggested no difference in the prevalence of pre-existing conditions. Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings suggest that PLHIV are at higher risk than the general population and should be prioritized for vaccine coverage and monitoring if diagnosed with COVID-19. This is especially important for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa that have a high burden of HIV in the younger populations who are more vulnerable. StrengthsThis study was carried out rigorously following the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We used a comprehensive search strategy across most of the main citation databases to ensure that no relevant studies were missed. We included studies where participants had confirmed COVID-19 only and we synthesized the findings from studies using a bias adjustment model that took into consideration the quality of included studies. LimitationsAll studies included in this review are observational studies and conclusions about causality require cautious interpretation. Due to a lack of data from included studies, we were not able to analyse the effect of being on treatment for HIV, and HIV control variables such as viral load and CD4 counts on COVID-19 hospitalization, intensive care services and mortality. Lastly most of the included studies had small samples overall or for PLHIV and this may affect the effect estimates in this analysis. Future research is therefore indicated to confirm these findings.","Mapahla, Lovemore; Abdelmaksoud, Asmaa; Arif, Rida; Islam, Nazmul; Chinhenzva, Albert; Doi, Suhail A. R.; Chivese, Tawanda",,183,3

Symptoms of COVID-19 may vary from mild (fever, dry cough, shortness of breath) to severe pneumonia-like respiratory symptoms as exacerbation of disease occurs. Unlike SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 has a higher binding affinity to ACE-2 receptors which signify its higher transmission rate from person to person. Even though ACE-2 is significant in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) regulation that exhibits protection to various organs, they play a significant role in COVID-19 disease pathogenesis. Viral interferences with the ACE-2 peptidase activity are found in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients leading to pro-inflammatory responses, hypertension and multi-organ damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 is constrained to a variety of organ systems but surface ACE-2 receptors on lung epithelia are largely affected, that lead to pathological alterations in lung histology which may progress to respiratory failure. The viral tropism mainly occurs by the attachment to the angiotensin-converting enzymes-2 receptors in the host cell, thus drugs targeting ACE-2 expressions may arise as the future therapeutic strategy to combat COVID-19 infections.The innovative approach of repurposing of drugs has shown temporary effectiveness to the rising pandemic. This article mainly focuses on the prominence of ACE-2 receptors which are expressed during the COVID infections and repurposing strategy of available drug therapies.","Joseph, Sherin; Nair, Bhagyalakshmi; Nath, Lekshmi R",Current molecular medicine (Online),183,16

The study's objective was to examine whether subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) hospitalisations and ruptured aneurysm coiling interventions demonstrated similar declines. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, retrospective, observational study across 6 continents, 37 countries and 140 comprehensive stroke centres. Patients with the diagnosis of SAH, aneurysmal SAH, ruptured aneurysm coiling interventions and COVID-19 were identified by prospective aneurysm databases or by International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes. The 3-month cumulative volume, monthly volumes for SAH hospitalisations and ruptured aneurysm coiling procedures were compared for the period before (1 year and immediately before) and during the pandemic, defined as 1 March-31 May 2020. The prior 1-year control period (1 March-31 May 2019) was obtained to account for seasonal variation. FINDINGS: There was a significant decline in SAH hospitalisations, with 2044 admissions in the 3 months immediately before and 1585 admissions during the pandemic, representing a relative decline of 22.5% (95% CI -24.3% to -20.7%, p<0.0001). Embolisation of ruptured aneurysms declined with 1170-1035 procedures, respectively, representing an 11.5% (95%CI -13.5% to -9.8%, p=0.002) relative drop. Subgroup analysis was noted for aneurysmal SAH hospitalisation decline from 834 to 626 hospitalisations, a 24.9% relative decline (95% CI -28.0% to -22.1%, p<0.0001). A relative increase in ruptured aneurysm coiling was noted in low coiling volume hospitals of 41.1% (95% CI 32.3% to 50.6%, p=0.008) despite a decrease in SAH admissions in this tertile. INTERPRETATION: There was a relative decrease in the volume of SAH hospitalisations, aneurysmal SAH hospitalisations and ruptured aneurysm embolisations during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings in SAH are consistent with a decrease in other emergencies, such as stroke and myocardial infarction.","Nguyen, Thanh N; Haussen, Diogo C; Qureshi, Muhammad M; Yamagami, Hiroshi; Fujinaka, Toshiyuki; Mansour, Ossama Y; Abdalkader, Mohamad; Frankel, Michael; Qiu, Zhongming; Taylor, Allan; Lylyk, Pedro; Eker, Omer F; Mechtouff, Laura; Piotin, Michel; Lima, Fabricio Oliveira; Mont039,; Alverne, Francisco; Izzath, Wazim; Sakai, Nobuyuki; Mohammaden, Mahmoud; Al-Bayati, Alhamza R; Renieri, Leonardo; Mangiafico, Salvatore; Ozretic, David; Chalumeau, Vanessa; Ahmad, Saima; Rashid, Umair; Hussain, Syed Irteza; John, Seby; Griffin, Emma; Thornton, John; Fiorot, Jose Antonio; Rivera, Rodrigo; Hammami, Nadia; Cervantes-Arslanian, Anna M; Dasenbrock, Hormuzdiyar H; Vu, Huynh Le; Nguyen, Viet Quy; Hetts, Steven; Bourcier, Romain; Guile, Romain; Walker, Melanie; Sharma, Malveeka; Frei, Don; Jabbour, Pascal; Herial, Nabeel; Al-Mufti, Fawaz; Ozdemir, Atilla Ozcan; Aykac, Ozlem; Gandhi, Dheeraj; Chugh, Chandril",Stroke vasc. neurol.

The disease progression associated with the proinflammatory host response prompted us to examine the role of early corticosteroid therapy in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a single pretest, single posttest quasi-experiment in a multicenter health system in Michigan from 12 March to 27 March 2020. Adult patients with confirmed moderate to severe COVID were included. A protocol was implemented on 20 March 2020 using early, short-course, methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day divided in 2 intravenous doses for 3 days. Outcomes of standard of care (SOC) and early corticosteroid groups were evaluated, with a primary composite endpoint of escalation of care from ward to intensive care unit (ICU), new requirement for mechanical ventilation, and mortality. All patients had at least 14 days of follow-up. RESULTS: We analyzed 213 eligible subjects, 81 (38%) and 132 (62%) in SOC and early corticosteroid groups, respectively. The composite endpoint occurred at a significantly lower rate in the early corticosteroid group (34.9% vs 54.3%, P = .005). This treatment effect was observed within each individual component of the composite endpoint. Significant reduction in median hospital length of stay was also observed in the early corticosteroid group (5 vs 8 days, P < .001). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated an independent reduction in the composite endpoint at 14-days controlling for other factors (adjusted odds ratio: 0.41; 95% confidence interval, .22 - .77). CONCLUSIONS: An early short course of methylprednisolone in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 reduced escalation of care and improved clinical outcomes.

The study aimed to evaluate the sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP), and anxiety level of pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan and investigate the influencing factors for prenatal anxiety in this specific context. METHODS: Pregnant subjects' KAP towards COVID-19 and their sociodemographics and pregnancy information were collected using questionnaires. The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used to assess anxiety status. Factors associated with the level of prenatal anxiety were analyzed by Pearson's chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The prenatal anxiety prevalence in this population was 20.8%. The mean score of knowledge was 13.2 ± 1.1 on a 0 ~ 14 scale. The attitudes and practices data showed that 580/ 817 (71.0%) were very concerned about the news of COVID-19, 455/817 (55.7%) considered the official media to be the most reliable information source for COVID-19, and 681/817 (83.4%) were anxious about the possibility of being infected by COVID-19. However, only 83/817 (10.2%) worried about contracting COVID-19 infection through the ultrasound transducer during a routing morphology scan. About two-thirds 528/817 (64.6%) delayed or canceled the antenatal visits. Approximately half of them 410/817 (50.2%) used two kinds of personal protection equipments (PPEs) during hospital visits. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the influential factors for prenatal anxiety included previous children in the family, knowledge score, media trust, worry of contracting the COVID-19 infection and worry about getting infected with COVID-19 from the ultrasound probe antenatal care (ANC) schedule. CONCLUSION: Prenatal anxiety was prevalent among pregnant women in Wuhan during the outbreak of COVID-19. The current findings identified factors associated with the level of prenatal anxiety that could be targeted for psychological care.","Ding, Wenping; Lu, Jianmei; Zhou, Yan; Wei, Weizhong; Zhou, Zhihong; Chen, Min",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,183,17

As remote communications will outlast the pandemic, it is crucial to protect users' security and respect their privacy in this unprecedented setting, and that requires a thorough understanding of their behaviors, attitudes, and concerns toward various aspects of remote communications. To this end, we conducted an online study with 220 worldwide Prolific participants. We found that privacy and security are among the most frequently mentioned factors impacting participants' attitude and comfort level with conferencing tools and meeting locations. Open-ended responses revealed that most participants lacked autonomy when choosing conferencing tools or using microphone/webcam in their remote meetings, which in several cases contradicted their personal privacy and security preferences.

We framed our inquiry within the Job Demand-Control-Support model that has guided researchers in parallel studies of work stress among prison officers. Method: Data on officers' background characteristics, job demands, work-related control or autonomy, support from coworkers or family members, safety risks, and work-related stress were examined across 1380 officers working in 19 jails. Results: Unreasonable workloads, perceptions of insufficient staff, role problems, less control or autonomy, a lack of support at work or home, and exposure to violence were associated with greater stress among jail officers. Jails with characteristics that threatened order and security-having more inmates per officer and greater levels of inmate violence-had higher levels of stress among officer workforces. Conclusions: Findings largely support research on work stress among prison officers and may inform efforts to reduce stress and improve quality of life among jail and prison personnel. Delegating appropriate workloads, the maintenance of control, social supports, and the reduction of safety risks are all important for reducing work stress among jail officers.","Ellison, Jared M; Caudill, Jonathan W",J Crim Justice,183,27

As the virus spread, reports of severe perioperative complications, including fatalities, began to emerge in the literature. We present a case of a previously healthy patient who developed classic symptoms of appendicitis. The patient was also found to be positive for COVID-19. Given the risks to both the patient and surgical team, we elected to pursue a non-operative management strategy for this patient with appendicitis. Materials and methods: A 13 year old female with COVID-19 presented with a day of right lower quadrant abdominal pain. A computerized tomography (CT) scan diagnosed uncomplicated appendicitis. The patient was successfully treated non-operatively with antibiotics and discharged home. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this case illustrates the first report of a pediatric patient with concomitant appendicitis and COVID-19 infection. We have been able to utilize a non-operative management strategy to effectively treat the patient's acute appendicitis, while protecting her from the risks of undergoing a general anesthetic as well as the operative team. We hope this report can provide others with a potential management strategy for similar patients.","Jones, Brian A.; Slater, Bethany J.",J. Pediatr. Surg. Case Rep.,183,1

Remdesivir (REM) was granted its first conditional marketing authorisation in the EU in June 2020. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and local health authorities all across the EU have since strongly recommended the implementation of pharmacovigilance activities aimed at further evaluating the safety of this new drug. The objective of this study was to evaluate adverse drug reactions (ADRs) attributed to either REM or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental, a Portuguese hospital centre based in Lisbon. We present the preliminary results reporting plausible adverse effects of either HCQ or REM. METHODS: An observational cohort study was carried out between 16 March and 15 August 2020. Participants were divided into two cohorts: those prescribed an HCQ regimen, and those prescribed REM. Suspected ADRs were identified using an active monitoring model and reported to the Portuguese Pharmacovigilance System through its online notification tool. The ADR cumulative incidence was compared between the two cohorts. RESULTS: The study included 149 patients, of whom 101 were treated with HCQ and the remaining 48 with REM. The baseline characteristics were similar between the two cohorts. A total of 102 ADRs were identified during the study period, with a greater incidence in the HCQ cohort compared with the REM cohort (47.5% vs 12.5%; p<0.001). Causality was assessed in 81 ADRs, all of which were considered possible. CONCLUSIONS: Real-world data are crucial to further establish the safety profile for REM. HCQ is no longer recommended for the treatment of COVID-19.","Falcão, Fátima; Viegas, Erica; Carmo, Ines; Soares, Joana; Falcao, Margarida; Solano, Mariana; Cavaco, Patricia; Mendes, Dina; Rijo, João; Povoa, Pedro; Pais Martins, Antonio; Carmo, Eduarda; Mansinho, Kamal; Fonseca, Candida; Campos, Luis; Carvalho, António; Mirco, Ana; Farinha, Helena; Aldir, Isabel; Correia, José",,183,27

METHODS: This was a cohort study with retrospective comparison of 14,780 in-person encounters and 2,589 telehealth encounters, including 2,093 audio-video telemedicine and 496 scheduled telephone encounters, between October 1, 2019 and April 24, 2020. We compared in-person and telehealth encounters for patient demographics and diagnoses. For audio-video telemedicine encounters, we analyzed questionnaire responses addressing provider experience, follow-up plans, technical quality, need for in-person assessment, and parent/caregiver satisfaction. We performed manual reviews of encounters flagged as concerning by providers. RESULTS: There were no differences in patient age and major ICD-10 codes before and after transition. Clinicians considered telemedicine satisfactory in 93% (1,200 of 1,286) of encounters and suggested telemedicine as a component for follow-up care in 89% (1,144 of 1,286) of encounters. Technical challenges were reported in 40% (519 of 1,314) of encounters. In-person assessment was considered warranted after 5% (65 of 1,285) of encounters. Patients/caregivers indicated interest in telemedicine for future care in 86% (187 of 217) of encounters. Participation in telemedicine encounters compared to telephone encounters was less frequent among patients in racial or ethnic minority groups. CONCLUSIONS: We effectively converted most of our outpatient care to telehealth encounters, including mostly audio-video telemedicine encounters. Providers rated the vast majority of telemedicine encounters to be satisfactory, and only a small proportion of encounters required short-term in-person follow-up. These findings suggest that telemedicine is feasible and effective for a large proportion of child neurology care. Additional strategies are needed to ensure equitable telemedicine use.","Rametta, Salvatore C; Fridinger, Sara E; Gonzalez, Alexander K; Xian, Julie; Galer, Peter D; Kaufman, Michael; Prelack, Marisa S; Sharif, Uzma; Fitzgerald, Mark P; Melamed, Susan E; Malcolm, Marissa P; Kessler, Sudha Kilaru; Stephenson, Donna J; Banwell, Brenda L; Abend, Nicholas S; Helbig, Ingo",Neurology,183,1

Our results show that isolates LJL/140820 and I0306/17 may be derived from the Ma5 (another Mass-type live-attenuated vaccine strain) and H120 vaccine strains, respectively. The I1124/16 strain was found to be a M41 variant that likely resulted from nucleotide accumulated mutations in the genome. Consistently, the results of the virus neutralization test showed that isolate I1124/16 was antigenically related but slight different from the M41. Our results from the protection experiments pointed out that chickens immunized with H120 failed to eliminate viral shedding after infection with the isolate I1124/16, which was different from that of M41; this result was consistent to the field observation and further implicated that the variant IBV isolate I1124/16 was antigenic different from the M41 strain. Furthermore, the I1124/16 was found to have comparable but slightly lower pathogenicity with the M41 strain. More studies based on the reverse genetic techniques are needed to elucidate the amino acids in the S1 subunit of spike protein contributing to the altered antigenicity of the isolate I1124/16. In addition, an IBV isolate, LJL/130609, was found to be originated from recombination events between the I1124/16- and Connecticut-like strains. Our results from the virus neutralization test also showed that isolates LJL/130609 and I1124/16 were antigenic closely related. Hence, there are at least 3 different genetic evolution patterns for the circulation of the GI-1/Mass-type IBV field strains in China. The differences of vaccines used, the field conditions and genetic pressures between different flocks, likely account for the emergence, evolution patterns, and characteristics of the Mass-type IBV strains.","Sheng, Jie; Ren, Mengting; Han, Zongxi; Sun, Junfeng; Zhao, Yan; Liu, Shengwang",Poult Sci,183,20

This study was conducted to provide the international community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease. Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study. A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-55), and there was no significant gender difference (53.3% men).

Times of Coronavirus,16.626673,3.3983948,2020,"Introduction: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, novel approaches to diabetes care have been employed. Care in both the inpatient and outpatient setting has transformed considerably. Driven by the need to reduce the use of personal protective equipment and exposure for patients and providers alike, we transitioned inpatient diabetes management services to largely ""virtual"" or remotely provided care at our hospital. Methods: Implementation of a diabetes co-management service under the direction of the University of North Carolina division of endocrinology was initiated in July 2019. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the diabetes service was largely transitioned to a virtual care model in March 2020. Automatic consults for COVID-19 patients were implemented. Glycemic outcomes from before and after transition to virtual care were evaluated. Results: Data over a 15-week period suggest that using virtual care for diabetes management in the hospital is feasible and can provide similar outcomes to traditional face-to-face care. Conclusion: Automatic consults for COVID-19 patients ensure that patients with serious illness receive specialized diabetes care. Transitioning to virtual care models does not limit the glycemic outcomes of inpatient diabetes care and should be employed to reduce patient and provider exposure in the setting of COVID-19. These findings may have implications for reducing nosocomial infection in less challenging times and might address shortage of health care providers, especially in the remote areas.","Jones, Morgan S; Goley, April L; Alexander, Bonnie E; Keller, Scott B; Caldwell, Marie M; Buse, John B",Diabetes Technol Ther,183,1

Histological and ultrastructural examination of Discothyrea sauterirevealed that each of these areas is associated with a novel exocrine gland: the proximal procoxal gland is formed by a cluster of 15 round secretory cells of 34 µm with numerous mitochondria, smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.Their ducts have a diameter of 0.5-1 µm.The distal procoxal gland contains 50 secretory cells of 22 µm with numerous vacuoles and lamellar inclusions, and narrow ducts with a diameter of only 0.15-0.2 µm.The differences in ultrastructural appearance and duct diameter indicate that both glands produce a different but probably pheromonal secretion. The function of these novel procoxal glands could not yet be determined, although observation of D.sauteri workers and queens shows that they make frequent and peculiar leg movements, in which the foreleg basitarsus rubs over the coxal hairy areas. The foreleg basitarsus then rubs the ipsilateral hindleg basitarsus and antenna. As a last step of the sequence, the hindleg basitarsus strokes the gaster.In addition to the occurrence of these novel procoxal glands, histological examination of D. sauteri also revealed the presence of yet another novel but smaller procoxal base gland. Ants of the 'testacea group', that have less developed frontal lobes and no antennal scrobes, do not have procoxal hairy areas, although a distinct sculpturation with small pores may occur in the corresponding areas. The related Proceratium japonicum, that has a similar lifestyle as Discothyrea, does not have any of the procoxal glands and does not display the peculiar leg movements as reported for D. sauteri.","Billen, Johan; Lin, Chung-Chi; Esteves, Flavia A",Arthropod Struct Dev,183,15

From its point of origin in Wuhan, China to clinical laboratory at NIH, a mere six-month-old SARS-CoV-2 virus is keeping the clinicians, and scientists busy at various fronts. However, COVID-19 is an emerging and evolving disease and each day brings in more data, new figures, and findings from the field of clinical practice. The role of hematologists has been increasingly recognized during the current pandemic because of several reasons. Most important of them are the characteristic hematological findings of COVID-19 patients that also have prognostic implications and that were not seen in other viral infections. The treatment of hematological complications in COVID-19 patients is very challenging given the critical care setting. There are interim and limited guidelines thus far due to the novelty of the disease. As this remains to be a quite fluid situation, all the appropriate medical societies including the major hematology bodies are proposing initial and interim guidelines (e.g. ASH guideline). This puts a hematologist on consult service in a dubious position where, he/she must tailor the recommendations on case to case basis. The purpose of this review is to provide the background context about the impact of COVID-19 on the blood system and to summarize the current interim guidelines to manage the associated hematological issues in COVID-19 infection.","Sahu, Kamal Kant; Cerny, Jan",Blood Rev,183,1

This study aims to assess the association between SSB consumption and dental caries and erosion. METHODS: Systematic review of observational studies. Search strategy applied to Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, SciELO, LILACS, OpenGrey and HMIC. The risk of bias was assessed using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cross-Sectional Studies and evidence certainty using Grading of Recommendation Assessment Development and Evaluation. Relationships between SSB consumption and caries and erosion were estimated using random-effects model meta- and dose-response analyses. RESULTS: A total of 38 cross-sectional studies were included, of which 26 were rated as high quality. Comparing moderate-to-low consumption, there was significantly increased risk of both caries [OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.28-1.92; decayed, missing and filled teeth weighted mean differences (DMFT WMD) = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.38-1.26] and erosion (OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.01-2.03). Comparing high-to-moderate consumption, there was further increased risk of caries (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.17-1.99; DMFT WMD = 1.16, 95% CI: -0.59-2.91) and erosion (OR = 3.09, 95% CI: 1.37-6.97). A dose-response gradient and high certainty of evidence was observed for caries. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing SSB consumption is associated with increased risk of dental caries and erosion. Studies were cross-sectional, hence temporality could not be established, but the positive dose-response suggests this relationship is likely to be causal. These findings illustrate the potential benefits to oral health of policies that reduce SSB consumption, including sugar taxation.","Valenzuela, Maria Josefina; Waterhouse, Beverley; Aggarwal, Vishal R; Bloor, Karen; Doran, Tim",Eur. j. public health,183,29

Protease inhibitors are under consideration as virus entry inhibitors that prevent the cleavage of the coronavirus spike (S) protein by cellular proteases. Herein, we showed that the protease inhibitor aprotinin (but not the protease inhibitor SERPINA1/alpha-1 antitrypsin) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in therapeutically achievable concentrations. An analysis of proteomics and translatome data indicated that SARS-CoV-2 replication is associated with a downregulation of host cell protease inhibitors. Hence, aprotinin may compensate for downregulated host cell proteases during later virus replication cycles. Aprotinin displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in different cell types (Caco2, Calu-3, and primary bronchial epithelial cell air-liquid interface cultures) and against four virus isolates. In conclusion, therapeutic aprotinin concentrations exert anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity.

Two lab sessions were modified so that students could complete them from home using household equipment and pre-lab instruction was delivered using online videos. After the course, student performance on learning objectives for each lab, evaluated using rubrics, and student grades were analyzed. Students performed well on soil color and texture but struggled with new concepts like identifying landscape positions. Students were able to practice hands-on skills and learn more about soils near their homes. The lessons learned from the experience were that students need to submit photos or maps to document their lab exercises and to be used in grading and verification, to ensure that students have equipment and tools they need to complete the labs, and frequent feedback or communication during laboratory exercises is needed.

The Department of Pathology responded by transitioning a fourth-year clinical elective to an all-remote format composed of synchronous didactics, daily clinical sign-out utilizing digital microscopy, and asynchronous learning materials. Thirty-seven medical students completed 2- or 4-week anatomic pathology electives tailored to meet their career goals and allowing them to progress toward graduation. Institutional Review Board approval was granted to survey students’ perceptions of engagement in the remote learning environment. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected using a standardized school-wide end-of-rotation survey, an online survey developed by the authors, and students’ self-directed learning goals. End-of-rotation data showed the remote pathology course performed well (4.88 of possible 5) when compared to all advanced clinical clerkships (4.51, n = 156 courses), all elective rotations (4.41, n = 50 courses), and the traditional in-person pathology elective (4.73). Core strengths in the virtual environment included high educational value, flexibility of content and schedule, organization, tailoring to an individual’s learning goals, and a positive education environment. Deficits included the inability to gross surgical specimens, inadequate observation or feedback about students’ skills, and impaired social connections. Areas for improvement included requests for in-person experiences and development of themed tracks for career exploration. Many aspects of anatomic pathology appear well-suited to the remote learning environment. While the remote model may not be sufficient for students pursuing careers in pathology, it can be adapted to increase nonpathologists’ understanding of interdisciplinary clinical collaboration with pathologists. © The Author(s) 2021.","Tanaka, K.

Based on standardized exams (SAT Suite) and a survey of rural Michigan students in grades 8-11, we find that rural students with broadband home Internet access are more interested in school and leave homework incomplete less often. However, the relationship to classroom grades (GPA) is relatively trivial. Yet, we find that students who are not dependent on a cell phone for Internet access and those with higher digital skills, especially social media skills, rank considerably higher on the SAT. Rural students with broadband Internet access are able to participate in a more diverse array of online media activities, which supports building digital skills. Any negative relationship between time spent on social media, video games, other digital media and educational outcomes is outweighed by the benefit to digital skills. However, aspects of rural culture;the emphasis on activities such as sports, as a path to postsecondary schooling and upward, social mobility;may be stunting the positive relationship between access, media use, and digital skills. Whereas extra-curricular sports have no direct relationship to SAT performance, students who spend more time on sports receive higher grades and have higher educational aspirations than those with more digital skills. We discuss the implications of rural students’ access to human capital and how the unequal relationship between digital skills and performance in the classroom and on the SAT may perpetuate inequalities.","Hampton, Keith N.; Robertson, Craig T.; Fernandez, Laleah Shin Inyoung Bauer Johannes M.",Telematics and Informatics,183,16

In addition to the direct burden it has placed on societies and health systems, it had a significant impact in the care of patients with chronic diseases, as healthcare resources were deployed to fight the crisis, and major travel and social restrictions were adopted. In the field of rheumatology, this has required notable efforts from departments and clinicians to adapt to the novel status quo and assure the follow-up of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. In the present viewpoint, we provide a practical approach to tackle this reality. Key measures include setting up preventive team management strategies, optimising communication with patients and reorganising patient care in all its dimensions. We then anticipate the nuances of rheumatology practice as restrictive measures are progressively lifted, while an effective vaccine is still pending.

We investigated the relationship between CXR scores on admission and the level of medical care required in patients with COVID-19. Further, we assessed the CXR-US correlation to explore the role of ultrasound in monitoring the course of COVID-19 pneumonia. Clinical features and CXR scores were obtained at admission and correlated with the level of intensity of care required [high- (HIMC) versus low-intensity medical care (LIMC)]. In a subgroup of patients, US findings were correlated with clinical and radiographic parameters. On hospital admission, CXR global score was higher in HIMCs compared to LIMC. Smoking history, pO2 on admission, cardiovascular and oncologic diseases were independent predictors of HIMC. The US score was positively correlated with FiO2 while the correlation with CXR global score only trended towards significance. Our study identifies clinical and radiographic features that strongly correlate with higher levels of medical care. The role of lung ultrasound in this setting remains undetermined and needs to be explored in larger prospective studies.","Cocconcelli, Elisabetta; Biondini, Davide; Giraudo, Chiara; Lococo, Sara; Bernardinello, Nicol; Fichera, Giulia; Barbiero, Giulio; Castelli, Gioele; Cavinato, Silvia; Ferrari, Anna; Saetta, Marina; Cattelan, Annamaria; Spagnolo, Paolo; Balestro, Elisabetta",,183,24

All these factors have been suggested to cause cognitive decline. Pathogenetically, this may result from direct negative effects of the immune reaction, acceleration or aggravation of pre-existing cognitive deficits, or de novo induction of a neurodegenerative disease. This article summarizes the current understanding of neurological symptoms of COVID-19 and hypothesizes that affected patients may be at higher risk of developing cognitive decline after overcoming the primary COVID-19 infection.

Altered immune cell metabolism and function are often perceived as a key causative factor of dysregulated inflammation. However, the contribution of adipocytes, the dominantly altered cell type in obesity with broad inflammatory properties, to infectious disease pathogenesis remains largely ignored. Thus, skewing of adipocyte-intrinsic cellular metabolism may lead to the development of pathogenic inflammatory adipocytes, which shape the overall immune responses by contributing to either premature immunosenescence, delayed hyperinflammation, or cytokine storm in infections. In this review, we discuss the underappreciated contribution of adipocyte cellular metabolism and adipocyte-produced mediators on immune system modulation and how such interplay may modify disease susceptibility and pathogenesis of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections in obese individuals.","Alarcon, Pablo C; Damen, Michelle S M A; Madan, Rajat; Deepe, George S; Spearman, Paul; Way, Sing Sing; Divanovic, Senad",Mucosal immunology (Online),183,2

An evidence-based symptom criteria for identifying HCWs for testing, based on the probability of positive COVID-19 test results, would allow for a more appropriate use of testing resources. METHODS: This was an observational study of outpatient COVID-19 testing of HCWs. Prior to testing, HCWs were asked about the presence of 10 symptoms. Their responses were then compared to their subsequent pharyngeal swab COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test results. These data were used to derive and evaluate a symptom-based testing criteria. RESULTS: A total of 961 HCWs were included in the analysis, of whom 225 (23%) had positive test results. Loss of taste or smell was the symptom with the largest positive likelihood ratio (3.33). Dry cough, regardless of the presence or absence of other symptoms, was the most sensitive (74%) and the least specific (32%) symptom. The existing testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of three symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, dry cough) was 93% sensitive and 9% specific (area unce the curve [AUC] = 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59 to 0.67).

Circadian rhythms can play crucial role in the complex interplay between viruses and organisms, and temporized schedules (chronotherapy) have been positively tested in several medical diseases. We aimed to compare the possible effects of a morning vs. evening antiviral administration in COVID patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all patients admitted to COVID internal medicine units with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and treated with darunavir-ritonavir (single daily dose, for seven days). Age, sex, length of stay (LOS), pharmacological treatment, and timing of antiviral administration (morning or evening), were recorded. Outcome indicators were death or LOS, and laboratory parameters, e.g., variations in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2, mmHg) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) (PaO2/FiO2), and leucocyte count. RESULTS: The total sample consisted of 151 patients, 33 (21.8%) of whom were selected for antiviral treatment. The mean age was 61.8±18.3 years, 17 (51.5%) were male, and the mean LOS was 13.4±8.6 days. Nine patients (27.3%) had their antiviral administration in the morning, and 24 (72.7%) had antiviral administration in the evening. No fatalities occurred. Despite the extremely limited sample size, morning group subjects showed a significant difference in CRP variation, compared to that in evening group subjects (-65.82±33.26 vs. 83.32±304.89, respectively, p<0.032). No significant differences were found for other parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This report is the first study evaluating temporized morning vs. evening antiviral administration in SARS-CoV-2 patients. The morning regimen was associated with a significant reduction in CRP values. Further confirmations with larger and multicenter samples of patients could reveal novel potentially useful insights.","De Giorgi, A; Fabbian, F; Di Simone, E; Greco, S; De Giorgio, R; Zuliani, G; Passaro, A; Caselli, E; Manfredini, R",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,183,21

Yet the potential impact of suspending elective surgery on ICU bed capacity is unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 5 years of New York State data on ICU usage. Descriptions of ICU utilization and mechanical ventilation were stratified by admission type (elective surgery, emergent/urgent/trauma surgery, and medical admissions), and by geographic location (New York metropolitan region versus the rest of New York State). Data are presented as absolute numbers and percentages and all adult and pediatric ICU patients were included. RESULTS: Overall, ICU admissions in New York State were seen in 10.1% of all hospitalizations (n=1,232,986/n=12,251,617) and remained stable over a 5 year period from 2011 to 2015. Among n=1,232,986 ICU stays, sources of ICU admission included elective surgery (13.4%, n=165,365), emergent/urgent admissions/trauma surgery (28.0%, n=345,094), and medical admissions (58.6%, n=722,527). Ventilator utilization was seen in 26.3% (n=323,789/n=1,232,986) of all ICU patients of which 6.4% (n=20,652), 32.8% (n=106,186) and 60.8% (n=196,951) was for patients from elective, emergent, and medical admissions, respectively. New York City holds the majority of ICU bed capacity (70.0%; n=2496/n=3566) in New York State. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing elective surgery comprised a small fraction of ICU bed and mechanical ventilation use in New York State. Suspension of elective surgeries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may thus have a minor impact on ICU capacity when compared to other sources of ICU admission such as emergent/urgent admissions/trauma surgery and medical admissions.

Our aim was to investigate the value of additional chest CT for detection of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) in patients who undergo head CT for suspected stroke or head trauma in a COVID-19-endemic region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 27 patients (mean age, 74 years; range, 54-90 years; 20 men) who underwent head CT for suspected stroke (n = 21) or head trauma (n = 6), additional chest CT for COVID-19 detection, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing in a COVID-19-endemic region. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 were calculated. RESULTS: Final neurologic diagnoses were ischemic stroke (n = 11), brain contusion (n = 5), nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (n = 2), brain metastasis (n = 1), and no primary neurologic disorder (n = 8). Symptoms of possible COVID-19 infection (ie, fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath) were present in 20 of 27 (74%) patients. Seven of 27 patients (26%) had real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed-COVID-19 infection. Chest CT results were 6 true-positives, 15 true-negatives, 5 false-positives, and 1 false-negative. Diagnostic performance values of chest CT were a sensitivity of 85.7%, specificity of 75.0%, negative predictive value of 93.8%, and positive predictive value of 54.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of additional chest CT is fairly high. However, a negative result does not exclude COVID-19. The positive predictive value is poor. Correlation of chest CT results with epidemiologic history and clinical presentation, along with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, is needed for confirmation.","Kwee, R M; Krdzalic, J; Fasen, B A C M; de Jaegere, T M H",AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,183,1

We conducted this meta-analysis to explore the prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities in COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cases. Methods and Results Relevant reports updated to April 17, 2020, were searched from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library with no restriction on language. A random-effects model was used in this meta-analysis to obtain pooled proportions of cardiovascular comorbidities in COVID-19, SARS, and MERS. A total of 22 studies (12 for COVID-19, 4 for SARS, and 6 for MERS) were included in this analysis, and the average age of patients with COVID-19, SARS, and MERS was 46.41±1.79, 39.16±2.25, and 52.51±4.64 years, respectively. Proportions of cardiovascular comorbidities in coronavirus diseases were as follows: COVID-19: proportion of hypertension was 17.1% (95% CI, 13.2%-20.9%), proportion of cardiac disease was 4.5% (95% CI, 3.6%-5.5%) and proportion of diabetes mellitus was 8.5% (95% CI, 5.5%-11.4%); SARS: proportion of hypertension was 4.5% (95% CI, 2.0%-7.0%), proportion of cardiac disease was 2.1% (95% CI, 0.6%-3.7%) and proportion of diabetes mellitus was 3.7% (95% CI, 1.0%-6.4%); MERS: proportion of hypertension was 30.3% (95% CI, 18.3%-42.2%), proportion of cardiac disease was 20.9% (95% CI, 10.7%-31.1%), and proportion of diabetes mellitus was 45.4% (95% CI, 27.3%-63.5%). Conclusions The prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities varies among different coronavirus-associated diseases.

Revealing the health effects associated with smoking has been in the focus of intense research for decades. Due to these research efforts, there is a convincing evidence regarding the negative effects of conventional cigarettes. However, much less is known about the replacement products such as electronic cigarettes. Moreover, the effects of waterpipes are also not fully explored, in spite of their long history. The scope of the present work is to survey the open literature to map the knowledge related to the health effects of conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes and waterpipes. The analysis of the related scientific literature was performed based on papers retrieved in large publication repositories. Based on the reviewed literature, long-term smoking has demonstrated adverse effects on the respiratory as well as the heart and circulatory systems. In addition, the correlation between cigarette smoking and some gastroenterological and neurological diseases is also increasingly evident. By the same token, though the acute effects of e-cigarette and waterpipe are well documented, the protracted effects are still to be explored. The lack of pertinent information regarding the late effects of e-cigarette and hookah does not imply that there is no health risk associated with their consumption. On the contrary, in addition to the regular antismoke measures, pulmonologists and policy makers should do everything to lower the consumption of these alternative products.

Gene regulation is widely assumed to resolve these conflicting sex-specific selection pressures, and although there has been considerable focus on elucidating the role of gene expression level in sex-specific adaptation, other regulatory mechanisms have been overlooked. Alternative splicing enables different transcripts to be generated from the same gene, meaning that exons which have sex-specific beneficial effects can in theory be retained in the gene product, while exons with detrimental effects can be skipped. However, at present, little is known about how sex-specific selection acts on broad patterns of alternative splicing. Here we investigate alternative splicing across males and females of multiple bird species. We identify hundreds of genes that have sex-specific patterns of splicing, and establish that sex differences in splicing are correlated with phenotypic sex differences. Additionally, we find that alternatively spliced genes have evolved rapidly as a result of sex-specific selection, and suggest that sex differences in splicing offer another route to sex-specific adaptation when gene expression level changes are limited by functional constraints. Overall, our results shed light on how a diverse transcriptional framework can give rise to the evolution of phenotypic sexual dimorphism.","Rogers, Thea F; Palmer, Daniela H; Wright, Alison E",Mol. biol. evol,183,25

COVID-19-associated neutrophilia, increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, aberrant neutrophil activation, and infiltration of neutrophils into lungs suggest that neutrophils are important players in the disease immunopathology. The main objective of this study was to assess the phenotypic and functional characteristics of neutrophils in COVID-19 patients, with particular focus on the interaction between neutrophils and T cells. We hypothesize that the altered functional characteristics of COVID-19 patient-derived neutrophils result in skewed Th1/Th17 adaptive immune response, thus contributing to disease pathology. The expansion of G-MDSC and immature forms of neutrophils was shown in the COVID-19 patients. In the COVID-19 neutrophil/T cell cocultures, neutrophils caused a strong polarity shift toward Th17, and, conversely, a reduction of IFNÎ³-producing Th1 cells. The Th17 promotion was NOS dependent. Neutrophils, the known modulators of adaptive immunity, skew the polarization of T cells toward the Th17 promotion and Th1 suppression in COVID-19 patients, contributing to the discoordinated orchestration of immune response against SARS-CoV-2. As IL-17 and other Th17-related cytokines have previously been shown to correlate with the disease severity, we suggest that targeting neutrophils and/or Th17 represents a potentially beneficial therapeutic strategy for severe COVID-19 patients.","Parackova, Zuzana; Bloomfield, Marketa; Klocperk, Adam; Sediva, Anna",J. leukoc. biol,183,16

This study describes the trajectory of psychosocial symptoms in the last 6 months of life among cancer decedents who were receiving home care. METHODS: Observational population-based cohort study of cancer decedents who were receiving home care services between 2007 and 2014. Decedents had to have at least one home care assessment in the last 6 months of life for inclusion. Outcomes were the presence of psychosocial symptoms (i.e., anxiety, loneliness, depression, social decline, caregiver distress, and cognitive decline) at each week before death. RESULTS: Our cohort included 27,295 unique cancer decedents (30,368 assessments), of which 58% died in hospital. Fifty-six percent were older than 74, and 47% were female. The prevalence of all symptoms increased approaching death, except loneliness. Social decline (48%-78%) was the most prevalent psychosocial symptom, though loneliness was reported in less than 10% of the cohort. Caregiver distress rose over time from 15%-27%. A third of the cohort reported issues with cognitive impairment. Multivariate regression showed that physical symptoms such as uncontrolled pain, impairment in independent activities of daily living, and a high level of health instability all significantly worsened the odds of having a psychosocial symptom in the last 3 months of life. CONCLUSION: In this large home care cancer cohort, trajectories of psychosocial symptoms worsened close to death. Physical symptoms, such as uncontrolled pain, were associated with having worse psychosocial symptoms at end of life.","Seow, Hsien; Stevens, Tara; Barbera, Lisa C; Burge, Fred; McGrail, Kimberlyn; Chan, Kelvin K W; Peacock, Stuart J; Sutradhar, Rinku; Guthrie, Dawn M",Psycho-oncol.

Concurrently, macrophages shift between alternate and classical activation. A key enzyme upregulated in alternatively activated macrophages is indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which converts tryptophan to kynurenine for de novo synthesis of nicotinamide. Nicotinamide can be used to replenish cellular NAD+ supplies. We hypothesize that an insufficient cellular NAD+ supply is the root cause of metabolic shifts in macrophages. We assert that manipulation of nicotinamide pathways may correct deleterious immune responses.

MethodsWe invited confirmed COVID-19 cases and their household members to attend up to four household visits with collection of nasopharyngeal and serum samples over 28 days after index case onset. We calculated secondary attack rates (SAR) based on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein IgG antibodies (IgG Ab) and/or neutralizing antibodies (NAb) overall and per households. Three and six months later, we assessed the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. FindingsWe recruited 39 index cases and 90 household members. Among 87 household members evaluated, SAR was 48% (n=42), including 37 symptomatic secondary cases. In total, 80/129 (62%) participants developed both IgG Ab and NAb, while three participants only developed IgG Ab. Among participants who had both IgG Ab and NAb during the initial follow-up, 68/69 (99%) and 63/70 (90%) had IgG Ab and NAb at 3 months, while at 6 months, 59/75 (79%) and 63/75 (84%) had IgG Ab and NAb, respectively. Participants who required hospital care had initially 5-fold IgG Ab concentrations compared to cases with mild symptoms and 8-fold compared to asymptomatic cases. InterpretationFollowing detection of a COVID-19 case in a household, other members had a high risk of becoming infected. Follow-up of participants showed strong persistence of antibodies in most cases.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSHousehold transmission studies are pivotal to the characterization of transmission dynamics of emerging infectious diseases in a closed setting with homogenous exposure, including proportion of asymptomatic cases using serologic assessment of infection. Additionally, data on long-term persistence of immune response, including neutralizing antibodies following COVID-19 remains scarce. Our search on PubMed for articles published between January 1st 2020, and June 1st, 2021 using the search terms ""household"" AND ""transmission"" AND (""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"") retrieved 381 results including 35 relevant articles: 21 original household transmission studies, 5 reviews and 9 statistical transmission, modelling or register linkage studies. Depending on the diagnosis method and the duration of follow-up, secondary attack rates (SAR) ranged from 4.6% when household contacts were followed for 14 days and tested only in case of symptoms to close to 90%. None of the household transmission studies involved long-term convalescent follow-up. Added value of this studyThis extensive (one month) active follow-up, using RT-PCR diagnosis and serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein IgG antibodies (IgG Ab) and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) showed that household transmission was high, with a 48% (42/87) SAR overall and 50% [IQR: 0-100%] at the level of the household. All but one out of 64 RT-PCR confirmed participants had developed both IgG Ab and NAb after immediate convalescence. Six months after inclusion, majority of previously seropositive (IgG and/or NAb) participants still had IgG Ab (59/75) or NAb (63/75) showing long-term persistence of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Implications of all the available evidenceThe risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections within households is considerable. Isolation of the primary case, especially from household contacts with a high risk of severe disease, e.g. due to age or comorbidities, should be considered even though viral shedding might occur before confirmed diagnosis in household contacts. Long-term persistence of antibodies following infection, even in asymptomatic and mild cases, suggests enduring natural immunity and possibly protection from severe COVID-19.","Dub, Timothee; Nohynek, Hanna; Hagberg, Lotta; Liedes, Oona; Haveri, Anu; Virta, Camilla; Solastie, Anna; Vara, Saimi; Ekstrom, Nina; Osterlund, Pamela; Lind, Katja; Valtonen, Hanna; Hemmila, Heidi; Ikonen, Niina; Lukkarinen, Timo J; Palmu, Arto A; Melin, Merit",,183,9

The incidence and outcomes of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its impact on routine management for patients with pulmonary vascular disease is currently unknown.Objectives: To assess the cumulative incidence and outcomes of recognized COVID-19 for patients with PAH/CTEPH followed at accredited pulmonary hypertension centers, and to evaluate the pandemic's impact on clinic operations at these centers.Methods: A survey was e-mailed to program directors of centers accredited by the Pulmonary Hypertension Association. Descriptive analyses and linear regression were used to analyze results.Results: Seventy-seven center directors were successfully e-mailed a survey, and 58 responded (75%). The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 recognized in individuals with PAH/CTEPH was 2.9 cases per 1,000 patients, similar to the general U.S. population. In patients with PAH/CTEPH for whom COVID-19 was recognized, 30% were hospitalized and 12% died. These outcomes appear worse than the general population. A large impact on clinic operations was observed including fewer clinic visits and substantially increased use of telehealth. A majority of centers curtailed diagnostic testing and a minority limited new starts of medical therapy. Most centers did not use experimental therapies in patients with PAH/CTEPH diagnosed with COVID-19.Conclusions: The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 recognized in patients with PAH/CTEPH appears similar to the broader population, although outcomes may be worse. Although the total number of patients with PAH/CTEPH recognized to have COVID-19 was small, the impact of COVID-19 on broader clinic operations, testing, and treatment was substantial.","Lee, Joshua D; Burger, Charles D; Delossantos, Genecelle B; Grinnan, Daniel; Ralph, David D; Rayner, Sam G; Ryan, John J; Safdar, Zeenat; Ventetuolo, Corey E; Zamanian, Roham T; Leary, Peter J",Ann Am Thorac Soc,183,1

A recent study showed that aspirin was associated with improved survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who were treated with surgery. Objective: To examine whether use of NSAIDs during definitive chemoradiation therapy (CRT) was associated with improved outcomes in patients with HNSCC. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed patients with HNSCC who were treated with CRT at a single institution between January 1, 2005, and August 1, 2017. Patient and tumor characteristics included age, race/ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol use, comorbidities (respiratory, cardiovascular, immune, renal, endocrine), disease stage, human papillomavirus status, and treatment duration. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2019, to March 17, 2020. Exposures: Patients were dichotomized by NSAID use during treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures: The association of NSAID use with patterns of failure, disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS) was examined using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models. Survival estimates for OS and DSS were generated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Results: A total of 460 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 60 [53.9-65.6] years; 377 [82.0%] men) were included in the analysis. Among these patients, 201 (43.7%) were taking NSAIDs during treatment. On univariate analysis, NSAID use (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43-0.92; P = .02) was associated with better OS. On Cox regression analysis, after backward selection adjustment for potentially confounding factors (age, smoking status, primary tumor site, human papillomavirus status, diabetes, stroke, hyperlipidemia), NSAID use remained significantly associated with better OS (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.90; P = .02). NSAID use was associated with significantly better OS at 5 years compared with patients who did not take concurrent NSAIDs (63.6% [56 of 88 patients]; 95% CI, 58%-73% vs 56.1% [83 of 148 patients]; 95% CI, 50%-63%; P = .03). NSAID use was not associated with better DSS in univariate (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.48-1.41; P = .47) or multivariate (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.57-1.70; P = .44) analysis. NSAID use was not associated with better response to treatment (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.91-2.27; P = .12) or distant failure (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.68-1.84; P = .65). Change in local control with NSAID use was not statistically significant (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.31-1.10; P = .10). Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study suggests a possible OS advantage for patients taking NSAIDs during chemoradiation for HNSCC.

A team of radiologists and medical physicists performed 25 phantom CT studies using different automatic tube current modulation settings (SUREExposure3D technology). We then conducted a retrospective evaluation of the chest CT images from 22 patients with COVID-19 and calculated the density difference between the GGO and unaffected tissue. Finally, the results were matched to the phantom study results to determine the minimum noise index threshold value. The minimum density difference at the onset of COVID-19 was 252 HU (p < 0.001). This was found to correspond to the SUREExposure 3D noise index of 36. We established the noise index threshold of 36 for the Canon scanner without iterative reconstructions, allowing for a decrease in the dose-length product by 80%.

Keynote and invited speaking roles in professional and scientific conferences recognize expertise and leadership and are key factors in career advancement and academic promotions. The aim of this study was to investigate gender differences in representation at dental continuing professional development (CPD) events and conferences in Australia. METHODS: An analysis of the gender of speakers was conducted with CPD and conference programs that are publicly available online from the federal and Victorian branches of the Australian Dental Association, the peak national body for dentists. RESULTS: The planned 2020 Victorian Branch CPD program featured 30 events, with a mean 2.5 speakers per event. There were 58 scientific presentations in the schedule, 22 (38%) of which were allocated to female speakers. Seven CPD events in 2020 included only female speakers, and 13 included only male speakers.The 37th and 38th Australian Dental Congresses featured 25% and 36% of female speakers, respectively. All keynote speakers were male for both events, and men accounted for 86% and 93% of international speakers. CONCLUSIONS: While women are approaching parity in local and state-level CPD events, there is a large discrepancy in the male-to-female speaker ratio for major national conferences. Suggestions to improve gender imbalance include having women on the convening committee and developing and implementing policies to address the imbalance. There has been significant progress in addressing gender inequity in dentistry, but gender-balanced leadership in major conferences still needs to be addressed. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The findings of this study show that while women may be approaching parity with small continuing professional development events, they are still underrepresented as speakers in major conferences. It is recommended that active policies be implemented to reduce the imbalance to ensure gender-balanced leadership in one aspect of the dental profession in Australia.","Silva, M; Teoh, L",JDR Clin Trans Res,183,16

Graph neural network (GNN) has emerged as a powerful technique for modeling molecular data. However, previous supervised approaches usually suffer from the scarcity of labeled data and have poor generalization capability. Here, we proposed a novel Molecular Pre-training Graph-based deep learning framework, named MPG, that leans molecular representations from large-scale unlabeled molecules. In MPG, we proposed a powerful MolGNet model and an effective self-supervised strategy for pre-training the model at both the node and graph-level. After pre-training on 11 million unlabeled molecules, we revealed that MolGNet can capture valuable chemistry insights to produce interpretable representation. The pre-trained MolGNet can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of drug discovery tasks, including molecular properties prediction, drug-drug interaction, and drug-target interaction, involving 13 benchmark datasets. Our work demonstrates that MPG is promising to become a novel approach in the drug discovery pipeline.","Li, Pengyong; Wang, Jun; Qiao, Yixuan; Chen, Hao; Yu, Yihuan; Yao, Xiaojun; Gao, Peng; Xie, Guotong; Song, Sen",,183,23

However, several studies have shown that AChE inhibition alone cannot explain all the toxicological manifestations in prolonged exposure to OPs. The present study aimed to assess the status of antioxidants malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) (reduced), catalase, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) in chronic OP-exposed groups from Cameroon and Pakistan. Molecular analysis of genetic polymorphisms (SNPs) of glutathione transferases (GSTM1, GSTP1, GSTT1), catalase gene (CAT, rs7943316), sirtuin 1 gene (SIRT1, rs10823108), acetylcholinesterase gene (ACHE, rs2571598), and butyrylcholinesterase gene (BCHE, rs3495) were screened in the OP-exposed individuals to find the possible causative association with oxidative stress and toxicity. Cholinesterase and antioxidant activities were measured by colorimetric methods using a spectrophotometer. Salting-out method was employed for DNA extraction from blood followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for molecular analysis. Cholinergic enzymes were significantly decreased in OP-exposed groups. Catalase and SOD were decreased and MDA and FRAP were increased in OP-exposed groups compared to unexposed groups in both groups. GSH was decreased only in Pakistani OPs-exposed group. Molecular analysis of ACHE, BCHE, Catalase, GSTP1, and GSTM1 SNPs revealed a tentative association with their phenotypic expression that is level of antioxidant and cholinergic enzymes. The study concludes that chronic OPs exposure induces oxidative stress which is associated with the related SNP polymorphism. The toxicogenetics of understudied SNPs were examined for the first time to our understanding. The findings may lead to a newer area of investigation on OPs induced health issues and toxicogenetics.","Mbah Ntepe, Leonel Javeres; Habib, Rabia; Judith Laure, Ngondi; Raza, Saqlain; Nepovimova, Eugenie; Kuca, Kamil; Batool, Sajida; Muhammad Nurulain, Syed",,183,6

Antibody therapeutics hold enormous promise for the treatment of COVID-19. In March 2020, the Chinese Antibody Society, in collaboration with The Antibody Society, initiated the ""COVID-19 Antibody Therapeutics Tracker"" (""Tracker"") (https://chineseantibody.org/covid-19-track/) program to track the antibody-based COVID-19 interventions in preclinical and clinical development globally. The data are collected from the public domain and verified by volunteers on an ongoing basis. Here, we present exploratory data analyses and visualization to demonstrate the latest trends of COVID-19 antibody development, based on data for over 150 research and development programs and molecules included in the ""Tracker"" as of 8 August 2020. We categorized the data mainly by their targets, formats, development status, developers and country of origin. Although details are limited in some cases, all of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody candidates appear to target the viral spike protein (S protein), and most are full-length monoclonal antibodies. Most of the current COVID-19 antibody therapeutic candidates in clinical trials are repurposed drugs aimed at targets other than virus-specific proteins, while most of these virus-specific therapeutic antibodies are in discovery or preclinical studies. As of 8 August 2020, eight antibody candidates targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein have entered clinical studies, including LY-CoV555, REGN-COV2, JS016, TY027, CT-P59, BRII-196, BRII-198 and SCTA01. Ongoing clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies will help define the utility of these antibodies as a new class of therapeutics for treating COVID-19 and future coronavirus infections.","Yang, Lifei; Liu, Weihan; Yu, Xin; Wu, Meng; Reichert, Janice M; Ho, Mitchell",Antib Ther,183,2

METHODS: The COVID-19 Emergency Department (COVED) Project is an ongoing prospective cohort study that includes all adult patients presenting to The Alfred Hospital ED who undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2. Current guidelines recommend testing for patients with fevers or chills, acute respiratory symptoms or a high-risk exposure history, as well as implementation of infection control and prevention (IPC) precautions for all suspected and confirmed cases. Study outcomes include a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and intensive respiratory support. RESULTS: In the period 1-30 April 2020, 702 of 3453 ED patients (20%; 95%CI: 19-22) were tested, with a significant increase during the study period (IRR 1.019; 95%CI: 1.017-1.021, p<0.001). The primary outcome of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was recorded in 14 patients (2%; 95%CI: 1-3). Shortness of breath (77%), fatigue (100%), myalgia (67%) and diarrhoea (67%) were common among positive cases, while close contact (9%), fever (0%) and healthcare occupation (0%) were not. No positive cases required intensive respiratory support in the ED. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of ED patients with suspected COVID-19 is increasing. Low numbers of positive cases precluded development of accurate predictive tools, but the COVED Project is fulfilling an important role in monitoring the burden of IPC requirements on the ED. The increasing number of patients meeting isolation criteria has the potential to impact on patient flow and may lead to ED overcrowding.","O039,; Reilly, G M; Mitchell, R D; Wu, J; Rajiv, P; Bannon-Murphy, H; Amos, T; Brichko, L; Brennecke, H; Noonan, M P; Mitra, B; Paton, A; Hiller, R; Smit, D; Luckhoff, C; Santamaria, M J; Cameron, P A",Emerg. med Australas,183,33

What are the risk factors for COVID-19? What are the differences between this novel coronavirus and other coronaviruses? To answer these questions, a comparative study of three pathogenic coronaviruses that primarily invade the human respiratory system and may cause death, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This review describes the source of origin, transmission, and pathogenicity of these viruses. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 spreading entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of new-onset severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) symptoms in patients who underwent bariatric procedures during the declining curve period. SETTING: Private practice METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted and included patients with indications for bariatric surgery during the decreasing curve period of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic who underwent surgery under a hospital security protocol. Patients were asked to answer a questionnaire and had a swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The primary outcome measure was the presence of 14-day and 30-day postoperative symptoms associated with COVID-19. Mortality was also analyzed. RESULTS: Three hundred patients with negative RT-PCR were operated on from May to June 2020. Seventeen patients had their surgery postponed because of a positive RT-PCR test or close contact. None of the patients developed new-onset SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic infection after 30 days of observation. No deaths were reported. Eleven had complications not related to SARS-CoV-2.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic by systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: The PRISMA guideline was used for conducting this study. Related keywords were searched in credited resources including ISC, Magiran, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, ProQuest, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Embase to find the articles published on the prevalence of GAD among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic from the first of January to the end of June 2020. Meta-analysis was conducted by the random effects model. Results: In this study, 553 articles were initially identified, from which 19 studies were finally included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that the prevalence of GAD in health care workers based on the GAD-7 and GAD-2 instruments were 32.04% (95% CI: 26.89–37.19, I2 = 98.2%, p &lt; 0.001) and 22.62% (95% CI: 9.01–36.24, I2 = 97.7%, p &lt; 0.001).

Therefore, it is of great importance to develop new techniques to improve the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19. We herein developed an ultrasensitive, rapid, and duplex digital enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dELISA) for simultaneous detection of spike (S-RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 based on a single molecule array. This assay effectively combines magnetic bead encoding technology and the ultrasensitive detection capability of a single molecule array. The detection strategies of S-RBD protein and N-protein exhibited wide response ranges of 0.34-1065 pg/mL and 0.183-338 pg/mL with detection limits of 20.6 fg/mL and 69.8 fg/mL, respectively. It is a highly specific method for the simultaneous detection of S-RBD protein and N-protein and has minimal interference from other blood proteins. Moreover, the spike assay showed a satisfactory and reproducible recovery rate for the detection of S-RBD protein and N-protein in serum samples. Overall, this work provides a highly sensitive method for the simultaneous detection of S-RBD protein and N-protein, which shows ultrasensitivity and high signal-to-noise ratio and contributes to improve the diagnosis accuracy of COVID-19.","Cai, Qiyong; Mu, Jingjing; Lei, Yang; Ge, Jia; Aryee, Aaron Albert; Zhang, Xiaoge; Li, Zhaohui",Anal Bioanal Chem,183,26

To this end we developed a deterministic transmission model based on the renewal equation and fitted the model to daily case and death data in the first few months of 2020 in 79 countries and states, representing 4.2 billions individuals. Based on a region-specific infection fatality ratio, we inferred the time-varying probability of case detection and the time-varying decline in transmissiblity. As a validation, the predicted total number of infected was close to that found in serosurveys; more importantly, the inferred probability of detection strongly correlated with the number of daily tests per inhabitant, with 50 % detection achieved with 0.003 daily tests per inhabitants. Most of the decline in transmission was explained by the reductions in transmissibility (social distancing), which avoided 10 millions deaths in the regions studied over the first four months of 2020. In contrast, symptom-based testing and isolation of positive cases was not an efficient way to control the spread of the disease, as a large part of transmission happens before symptoms and only a small fraction of infected individuals was typically detected. The latter is explained by the limited number of tests available, and the fact that increasing test capacity often increases the probability of detection less than proportionally.

To resume transplantation, it is important to understand the prevalence of COVID-19 among transplant recipients, donors, and healthcare workers (HCWs) and its associated mortality. Methods: To investigate this, we studied severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 diagnostic test results among patients with end-stage renal disease or kidney transplants from the Johns Hopkins Health System (n = 235), and screening test results from deceased donors from the Southwest Transplant Alliance Organ Procurement Organization (n = 27), and donors, candidates, and HCWs from the National Kidney Registry and Viracor-Eurofins (n = 253) between February 23 and April 15, 2020. Results: We found low rates of COVID-19 among donors and HCWs (0%-1%) who were screened, higher rates of diagnostic tests among patients with end-stage renal disease or kidney transplant (17%-20%), and considerable mortality (7%-13%) among those who tested positive. Conclusions: These findings suggest the threat of COVID-19 for the transplant population is significant and ongoing data collection and reporting is critical to inform transplant practices during and after the pandemic.","Boyarsky, Brian J; Massie, Allan B; Love, Arthur D; Werbel, William A; Durand, Christine M; Avery, Robin K; Jackson, Kyle R; Kernodle, Amber B; Thomas, Alvin G; Ronin, Matthew; Altrich, Michelle; Niles, Patricia; Trahan, Chad; Hewlett, Jonathan; Segev, Dorry L; Garonzik-Wang, Jacqueline M",Transplant Direct,183,1

ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) that may develop in these patients may cause more complicated results with the effect of thrombosis burden. Our aim in this study is to determine the frequency of no-reflow phenomenon in COVID-19 patients with STEMI and to determine the factors that predict this complication. METHODS: In this study, which is a single-centre, retrospective and observational, a total of 126 patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) in our centre due to STEMI between 11 March 2020 and 10 January 2021 were evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: While 62 patients were in the COVID-19 (+) group, 64 patients were evaluated in the COVID-19 (-) group. When the two groups are compared, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were significantly higher, and the lymphocyte count was significantly lower in the COVID-19 (+) group. No-reflow was numerically higher in patients with COVID-19. In multivariable analysis, D-dimer and NLR were found to be independent predictors of no-reflow phenomenon in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although the no-reflow phenomenon was numerically higher in COVID-19 patients who underwent pPCI due to STEMI compared to the non-COVID group, no statistical difference was found in our study. However, NLR and D-dimer have been identified as independent predictors of no-reflow development risk in COVID-19 patients.","Güler, Arda; Gürbak, Ismail; Panç, Cafer; Güner, Ahmet; Ertürk, Mehmet",Acta Cardiol,183,24

In this study, we performed clot waveform analyses to investigate whether specific modulations are observed in COVID-19 subjects. We analyzed the second derivative of the absorbance in routine APTT tests performed using an ACL-TOP system. We observed high frequencies of abnormal patterns in APTT second-derivative curves that could be classified into an early shoulder type, a late shoulder type, or a biphasic type, high maximum first-derivative and second-derivative peak levels, and a low minimum second-derivative peak level in COVID-19 subjects. These modulations were not observed in subjects with disseminated intravascular coagulation. These abnormal patterns are also observed in patients with lupus anticoagulant, hemophilia, or factor IX deficiency. The plasma fibrinogen levels might also be involved in the abnormal APTT waveforms, especially the high maximum first-derivative and second-derivative peak levels. The abnormal patterns in the APTT second-derivative curves appear with highest frequency at around 2 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 and were not associated with the severity of COVID-19. These results suggest the possible presence of a specific abnormal coagulopathy in COVID-19.","Shimura, Takuya; Kurano, Makoto; Kanno, Yoshiaki; Ikeda, Mahoko; Okamoto, Koh; Jubishi, Daisuke; Harada, Sohei; Okugawa, Shu; Moriya, Kyoji; Yatomi, Yutaka",Sci Rep,183,16

Even though mainly discussed during the past two decades, its roots go back into the past century and even further, considering the use of bonfires to warn other villages of diseases. Insights from historical cases can therefore be useful for the ongoing discussion regarding the successful implementation of telemedicine. Subject and Methods: We analyzed three historical telemedicine cases (varying regarding time and place) and extracted their success factors and barriers as well as assessed their maturity by using the Telemedicine Community Readiness Model (TCRM). Evidence-based categories of success factors and barriers as well as the TCRM's dimensions were used as deductive categories to analyze the study material's content. Results: The analysis showed that the readiness for telemedicine is higher when the technology is the only option to access health care services. In all three cases, core readiness played a central role. However, the health sector, existing technology, and finance were barriers present at all times, while during pandemics, some barriers are only temporarily removed, for example, by putting legal issues on hold. The analyzed cases were all on lower levels of maturity as they mainly represent pilot tests or exceptional circumstances. Conclusion: Results indicate the important core functions in telemedicine initiatives as well as the diversity of their circumstances. Insights from such historical meta-perspectives can, for example, help to strengthen the sustainability of the increased use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic and scale up current telemedicine projects.","Reifegerste, Doreen; Harst, Lorenz; Otto, Lena",Z Gesundh Wiss,183,24

Additionally, mRNA vaccines are being studied in the clinic to treat a number of diseases including cancer, HIV, influenza and even genetic disorders. The increased demand for mRNA vaccines requires a technology platform and cost-effective manufacturing process with a well-defined product characterisation. Large scale production of mRNA vaccines consists in a 1 or 2-step in vitro reaction followed by a purification platform with multiple steps that can include Dnase digestion, precipitation, chromatography or tangential flow filtration.

We devised a compartmental model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies with a main focus on mass testing. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries, and the number of COVID-19-inflicted deaths. We assumed that COVID-19 survivors are immune (e.g., mutations are not considered) and that the virus is primarily passed on by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intensive care units. The model parameters have been chosen in a plausible range based on information found in the literature, but it is easily adaptable, i.e., these values can be replaced by updated information any time. We compared infection rates, the total number of people getting infected and the number of deaths in different scenarios. Social distancing or mass testing can contain or drastically reduce the infections and the predicted number of deaths when compared with a situation without mitigation. We found that mass testing alone and subsequent isolation of detected cases can be an effective mitigation strategy, alone and in combination with social distancing. It is of high practical relevance that a relationship between testing frequency and the effective reproduction number of the virus can be provided. However, unless one assumes that the virus can be globally defeated by reducing the number of infected persons to zero, testing must be upheld, albeit at reduced intensity, to prevent subsequent waves of infection. The model suggests that testing strategies can be equally effective as social distancing, though at much lower economic costs. We discuss how our mathematical model may help to devise an optimal mix of mitigation strategies against the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we quantify the theoretical limit of contact tracing and by how much the effect of testing is enhanced, if applied to sub-populations with increased exposure risk or prevalence.","Gorji, Hossein; Arnoldini, Markus; Jenny, David; Hardt, Wolf-Dietrich; Jenny, Patrick",Swiss Med Wkly,183,29

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A panel of international experts from ASTRO, ESTRO, and select Asia-Pacific countries completed a modified rapid Delphi process. Topics and questions were presented to the group, and subsequent questions were developed from iterative feedback. Each survey was open online for 24 hours, and successive rounds started within 24 hours of the previous round. The chosen cutoffs for strong agreement (&#8805;80%) and agreement (&#8805;66%) were extrapolated from the RAND methodology. Two pandemic scenarios, early (risk mitigation) and late (severely reduced radiation therapy resources), were evaluated. The panel developed treatment recommendations for 5 HNC cases. RESULTS: In total, 29 of 31 of those invited (94%) accepted, and after a replacement 30 of 30 completed all 3 surveys (100% response rate). There was agreement or strong agreement across a number of practice areas, including treatment prioritization, whether to delay initiation or interrupt radiation therapy for intercurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection, approaches to treatment (radiation dose-fractionation schedules and use of chemotherapy in each pandemic scenario), management of surgical cases in event of operating room closures, and recommended adjustments to outpatient clinic appointments and supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: This urgent practice recommendation was issued in the knowledge of the very difficult circumstances in which our patients find themselves at present, navigating strained health care systems functioning with limited resources and at heightened risk to their health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: We retrospectively compared the rates of positive screening tests for postpartum depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of 9 or more or self-injury factors) and liaison/psychiatric intervention rates between pre-pandemic and pandemic groups of postpartum women who delivered a live birth at our tertiary perinatal center in Yokohama, Japan between January 2019 and May 2020. Those whose postpartum health screening was performed in 2019 (March-June 2019) were considered the pre-pandemic group, and those whose screening was performed between March and June 2020 were considered the pandemic group. Adjustments were made for maternal background, pregnancy, and delivery outcomes, including a history of psychiatric disorders, complications, preterm delivery, NICU admission, and maternal postpartum complications, and the data were analyzed using a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Postpartum health screenings were performed on 339 women before the pandemic and 279 women during the pandemic. Positive screening rates for postpartum depression did not change before and during the pandemic (adjusted odds ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 0.885-2.46).

JAK-inhibitors role in COVID-19 infection appears to be multifaceted, including preventing viral endocytosis and dampening the effect of excessive chemokines. This drug class may be able to achieve these effects at already preapproved dosages. Concerns arise regarding reactivation of latent viral infections and the feasibility of their use in those with severe disease. Most interestingly, JAK-Inhibitors may also have an additional advantage for diabetic and obese populations, where the dysregulation of JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway may be responsible for their increased risk of poor outcomes.

METHODS: This was a prospective study carried out during the first pandemic wave in the intensive care units (ICUs) of two referral University Hospitals in Lombardy, Italy. Two hundred twenty-two consecutive mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients were evaluated during the ICU stay. In addition to major demographic and clinical data, we recorded information on the route and amount of nutritional support provided on a daily basis. RESULTS: Among patients still in the ICUs and alive on day 4 (N = 198), 129 (65.2%) and 72 (36.4%) reached a satisfactory caloric and protein intake, respectively, mainly by enteral route. In multivariable analysis, a satisfactory caloric intake on day 4 was associated with lower mortality (HR = 0.46 [95%CI, 0.42-0.50], P < 0.001). Mild obesity (body mass index [BMI] &#8805;30 and < 35 kg/m2) was associated with higher mortality (HR = 1.99 [95%CI, 1.07-3.68], P = 0.029), while patients with moderate-severe obesity (BMI&#8805;35 kg/m2) were less likely to be weaned from invasive mechanical ventilation (HR = 0.71 [95%CI, 0.62-0.82], P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the negative prognostic and clinical role of obesity in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients and suggested that early caloric deficit may independently contribute to worsen survival in this patients' population. Therefore, any effort should be made to implement an adequate timely nutritional support in all COVID-19 patients during the ICU stay.","Cereda, Emanuele; Guzzardella, Amedeo; Klersy, Catherine; Belliato, Mirko; Pellegrini, Andrea; Sciutti, Fabio; Mongodi, Silvia; Masi, Sara; Crotti, Silvia; Savioli, Monica; Zanella, Alberto; Mojoli, Francesco; Grasselli, Giacomo; Caccialanza, Riccardo",Clin. nutr.

Conspiracy thinking provides answers about the causes of an event, but it can also have harmful social consequences. Our research tested both the predictor and the consequences of two types of conspiracy beliefs related to the Covid-19 pandemic: (1) general conspiracy beliefs and (2) government-related conspiracy theories. In two studies in Poland (N total= 2726), we found that a perceived lack of individual control predicted both types of conspiracy theories, while a sense of collective control was positively related to general conspiracy beliefs but negatively associated with government-related conspiracy theories. Moreover, general conspiracy theories were related to the acceptance of xenophobic policies and to a less favourable attitude towards outgroups whereas government-related conspiracy theories were not. Additionally, people who believed in conspiratorial governments less frequently indicated that they used prevention methods, such as social distancing and handwashing. Our research demonstrates the importance of considering the content of various conspiracy theories when studying their social effects and potential causes. Knowing which attitudes may be associated with the endorsement of specific conspiracy theories can contribute to counteracting their negative consequences during crises.","Oleksy, Tomasz; Wnuk, Anna; Maison, Dominika; Łyś, Agnieszka",Pers.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 was followed by a period of relative evolutionary stasis lasting about 11 months. Since late 2020, however, SARS-CoV-2 evolution has been characterized by the emergence of sets of mutations, in the context of 'variants of concern', that impact virus characteristics, including transmissibility and antigenicity, probably in response to the changing immune profile of the human population. There is emerging evidence of reduced neutralization of some SARS-CoV-2 variants by postvaccination serum; however, a greater understanding of correlates of protection is required to evaluate how this may impact vaccine effectiveness. Nonetheless, manufacturers are preparing platforms for a possible update of vaccine sequences, and it is crucial that surveillance of genetic and antigenic changes in the global virus population is done alongside experiments to elucidate the phenotypic impacts of mutations. In this Review, we summarize the literature on mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the primary antigen, focusing on their impacts on antigenicity and contextualizing them in the protein structure, and discuss them in the context of observed mutation frequencies in global sequence datasets.","Harvey, William T; Carabelli, Alessandro M; Jackson, Ben; Gupta, Ravindra K; Thomson, Emma C; Harrison, Ewan M; Ludden, Catherine; Reeve, Richard; Rambaut, Andrew; Peacock, Sharon J; Robertson, David L",Nat Rev Microbiol,183,20

These conditions include thrombotic complications, myocardial dysfunction and arrhythmia, acute coronary syndromes, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatocellular injury, hyperglycemia and ketosis, neurologic illnesses, ocular symptoms, and dermatologic complications. Given that ACE2, the entry receptor for the causative coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is expressed in multiple extrapulmonary tissues, direct viral tissue damage is a plausible mechanism of injury. In addition, endothelial damage and thromboinflammation, dysregulation of immune responses, and maladaptation of ACE2-related pathways might all contribute to these extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.

This interpolation can be used simultaneously for efficient coding by predicting pixel data to be stored. Such joint inpainting and prediction approaches yield good results with simple components such as regular grids and Shepard interpolation on grey value images, but they lack a dedicated mode for colour images. Therefore, we evaluate different approaches for inpainting-based colour compression. Inpainting operators are able to reconstruct a large range of colours from a small colour palette of the known pixels. We exploit this with a luma preference mode which uses higher sparsity in YCbCr colour channels than in the brightness channel. Furthermore, we propose the first full vector quantisation mode for an inpainting-based codec that stores only a small codebook of colours.

This paper presents a novel methodology to perform a rapid detection of the fast technological convergence phenomenon that is occurring under the pressure of the Covid-19 pandemic. The fast detection has been performed thanks to the use of a novel source: the online blogging platform Medium. We demonstrate that the hybrid structure of this social journalism platform allows a rapid detection of innovation phenomena, unlike other traditional sources.

However, heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 testing may introduce biased estimates depending on analytic design. We aimed to explore the potential for collider bias in a large study of disease determinants, and evaluate individual, environmental and social determinants associated with SARS-CoV-2 testing and diagnosis among residents of Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We explored the potential for collider bias and characterized individual, environmental and social determinants of being tested and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection using cross-sectional analyses among 14.7 million community-dwelling people in Ontario, Canada. Among those with a diagnosis, we used separate analytic designs to compare predictors of people testing positive versus negative; symptomatic people testing positive versus testing negative; and people testing positive versus people not testing positive (i.e., testing negative or not being tested). Our analyses included tests conducted between Mar. 1 and June 20, 2020. RESULTS: Of 14 695 579 people, we found that 758 691 were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 25 030 (3.3%) had a positive test result. The further the odds of testing from the null, the more variability we generally observed in the odds of diagnosis across analytic design, particularly among individual factors. We found that there was less variability in testing by social determinants across analytic designs. Residing in areas with the highest household density (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.75-1.98), highest proportion of essential workers (adjusted OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.48-1.69), lowest educational attainment (adjusted OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.26-1.41) and highest proportion of recent immigrants (adjusted OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.15) were consistently related to increased odds of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis regardless of analytic design. INTERPRETATION: Where testing is limited, our results suggest that risk factors may be better estimated using population comparators rather than test-negative comparators. Optimizing COVID-19 responses necessitates investment in and sufficient coverage of structural interventions tailored to heterogeneity in social determinants of risk, including household crowding, occupation and structural racism.","Sundaram, Maria E; Calzavara, Andrew; Mishra, Sharmistha; Kustra, Rafal; Chan, Adrienne K; Hamilton, Mackenzie A; Djebli, Mohamed; Rosella, Laura C; Watson, Tristan; Chen, Hong; Chen, Branson; Baral, Stefan D; Kwong, Jeffrey C",CMAJ,183,16

METHODS: Fifteen participants were recruited from COVID-19 testing tents in the Capital Region of Denmark in March and April 2020. A phenomenological-hermeneutic approach inspired by Ricoeur's theory of interpretation was used. RESULTS: The analysis revealed five themes. (1) The participants' experiences of awaiting a COVID-19 test result illuminated concerns related to infecting others rather than their own health. Experiences of guilt for not taking all possible precautions to avoid the spread of COVID-19 were described and thoughts of potentially having exposed others bothered the participants. (2) The test result would guide their precautions and therefore regulate behaviour at home and in society. (3) Even though the participants did not take all possible precautions they made some changes in their everyday lives. (4) Leaving the individual with the responsibility for taking precautions based on their subjective experiences created feelings of insecurity and uncertainty. (5) Being met by health professionals was an experience that meant for the particpants that behaviour towards limiting the infection became very clear. The seriousness experienced around the test situation facilitated this attitude and behaviour in the participants. Conclusion: This study illuminated how testing for COVID-19 regulates behavior in the general population. The testing was both important for the individual's cautious behavior towards other people, work and in getting around in society but also a way to regulate behavior from a societal perspective to quicken suppression and avoid transmission of COVID-19.","Christensen, Signe Westh; Dagyaran, Ilkay; Bernild, Camilla; Missel, Malene; Berg, Selina Kikkenborg",Scand J Public Health,183,24

However, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from COVID-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems. Although COVID-19 involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with underlying comorbidities require additional care.","Kobayashi, Tetsuro; Jung, Sung-Mok; Linton, Natalie M.; Kinoshita, Ryo; Hayashi, Katsuma; Miyama, Takeshi; Anzai, Asami; Yang, Yichi; Yuan, Baoyin; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.; Suzuki, Ayako; Nishiura, Hiroshi",J.

The aim of this study was to provide a detailed characterization of the vascular alterations during SARS-CoV-2 infection and to evaluate the impaired vascular integrity. Groups of ten golden Syrian hamsters were infected intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 or phosphate-buffered saline (mock infection). Necropsies were performed at 1, 3, 6, and 14 days post-infection (dpi). Lung samples were investigated using hematoxylin and eosin, alcian blue, immunohistochemistry targeting aquaporin 1, CD3, CD204, CD31, laminin, myeloperoxidase, SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, and transmission electron microscopy. SARS-CoV-2 infected animals showed endothelial hypertrophy, endothelialitis, and vasculitis. Inflammation mainly consisted of macrophages and lower numbers of T-lymphocytes and neutrophils/heterophils infiltrating the vascular walls as well as the perivascular region at 3 and 6 dpi. Affected vessels showed edema formation in association with loss of aquaporin 1 on endothelial cells. In addition, an ultrastructural investigation revealed disruption of the endothelium. Summarized, the presented findings indicate that loss of aquaporin 1 entails the loss of intercellular junctions resulting in paracellular leakage of edema as a key pathogenic mechanism in SARS-CoV-2 triggered pulmonary lesions.","Allnoch, Lisa; Beythien, Georg; Leitzen, Eva; Becker, Kathrin; Kaup, Franz-Josef; Stanelle-Bertram, Stephanie; Schaumburg, Berfin; Mounogou Kouassi, Nancy; Beck, Sebastian; Zickler, Martin; Herder, Vanessa; Gabriel, Gülsah; Baumgärtner, Wolfgang",Viruses,183,21

The recent phenomenon of binge-watching was also explored. METHODS: A survey to assess screen time across multiple devices, dietary habits, sleep duration and quality, perceived stress, self-rated health, physical activity, and body mass index, was administered to a sample of US adults using the Qualtrics platform and distributed via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Participants were adults 18 years of age and older, English speakers, current US residents, and owners of a television and at least one other device with a screen. Three different screen time categories (heavy, moderate, and light) were created for total screen time, and separately for screen time by type of screen, based on distribution tertiles. Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to examine differences in dietary habits and health-related characteristics between screen time categories. RESULTS: Aggregate screen time across all devices totaled 17.5 h per day for heavy users. Heavy users reported the least healthful dietary patterns and the poorest health-related characteristics - including self-rated health - compared to moderate and light users. Moreover, unique dietary habits emerged when examining dietary patterns by type of screen separately, such that heavy users of TV and smartphone displayed the least healthful dietary patterns compared to heavy users of TV-connected devices, laptop, and tablet. Binge-watching was also significantly associated with less healthy dietary patterns, including frequency of fast-food consumption as well as eating family meals in front of a television, and perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS: The present study found that poorer dietary choices, as well as other negative health-related impacts, occurred more often as the viewing time of a variety of different screen-based devices increased in a sample of US adults. Future research is needed to better understand what factors among different screen-based devices might affect health behaviors and in turn health-related outcomes. Research is also required to better understand how binge-watching behavior contributes impacts health-related behaviors and characteristics.","Vizcaino, Maricarmen; Buman, Matthew; DesRoches, Tyler; Wharton, Christopher",BMC Public Health,183,24

It has emerged as the predominant ‘world problematique’. Though entire populations are affected by climate change, women and girls suffer the most. Due to their traditional roles, women are heavily dependent on natural resources. As already seen, as a consequence of natural disasters and during Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, women have faced heightened real-life challenges specially being vulnerable to different forms of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). They suffer from a lack of protection, privacy, and mental trauma. Women are exposed to SGBV due to weak or absence of social, economic, political security and the culture of widespread impunity to the perpetrators. There is double victimization of women both as human beings and because of their gender. Effect of SGBV is highly injurious and perpetual. A close study of four main areas of international law does not yield any international legal instrument that deals with SGBV against women during and after the climate change induced disasters. This is more ominous when growing evidence suggests role of climate change in exacerbation of SGBV against women and girls. Even texts of the three specific climate change treaties (1992 UNFCCC, 1997 Kyoto Protocol and 2005 Paris Agreement) do not address this issue. It has been given attention only through the decisions of the Conference of the Parties in recent years. Due to serious psychological and bodily harm SGBV causes to women, it needs to be explicitly factored in respective international legal instruments on climate change and disasters. Amidst ignorance, denials and lack of adequate attention as regards impact of climate change in exacerbating SGBV against women and girls from the scholars and decision-makers in the field, this study makes a modest effort to deduce and analyze –from scattered initiatives, scholarly literature in different areas, existing international legal instruments and intergovernmental processes –the growing causal relationship between climate change and SGBV against women and girls so as to suggest a way out for our better common future. It is a new challenge to international law that needs to be duly addressed in a timely manner.

The present study extracted several significant academic features that determine the Master of Business Administration (MBA) student placement and confirm the placed gender. This paper recommended a novel futuristic roadmap for students, parents, guardians, institutions, and companies to benefit at a certain level. Out of seven experiments, the first five experiments were conducted with deep statistical computations, and the last two experiments were performed with supervised machine learning approaches. On the one hand, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperformed others with the uppermost accuracy of 90% to predict the employment status. On the other hand, the Random Forest (RF) attained a maximum accuracy of 88% to recognize the gender of placed students. Further, several significant features are also recommended to identify the placement of gender and placement status. A statistical t-test at 0.05 significance level proved that the student’s gender did not influence their offered salary during job placement and MBA specializations Marketing and Finance (Mkt&Fin) and Marketing and Human Resource (Mkt&HR) (p &gt; 0.05). Additionally, the result of the t-test also showed that gender did not affect student’s placement test percentage scores (p &gt; 0.05) and degree streams such as Science and Technology (Sci&Tech), Commerce and Management (Comm&Mgmt). Others did not affect the offered salary (p &gt; 0.05). Further, the χ2 test revealed a significant association between a student’s course specialization and student’s placement status (p &lt; 0.05). It also proved that there is no significant association between a student’s degree and placement status (p &gt; 0.05). The current study recommended automatic placement prediction with demographic impact identification for the higher educational universities and institutions that will help human communities (students, teachers, parents, institutions) to prepare for the future accordingly.","Kumar, Deepak Verma Chaman Singh Pradeep Kumar Raboaca Maria Simona Raluca-Andreea Felseghi Ghafoor Kayhan Zrar",Mathematics,183,30

The gold standard to identify infected people is RT-qPCR, which is highly sensitive, but needs specialized equipment and trained personnel. The demand for these reagents has caused shortages in certain countries. Isothermal nucleic acid techniques, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) have emerged as an alternative or as a complement to RT-qPCR. In this study, we developed and evaluated a multi-target RT-LAMP for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The method was evaluated against an RT-qPCR in 152 clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples. The results obtained indicated that both assays presented a ""good concordance"" (Cohen's k of 0.69), the RT-LAMP was highly specific (99%) but had lower sensitivity compared to the gold standard (63.3%). The calculated low sensitivity was associated with samples with very low viral load (RT-qPCR Cq values higher than 35) which may be associated with non-infectious individuals. If an internal Cq threshold below 35 was set, the sensitivity and Cohen's k increased to 90.9% and 0.92, respectively. The interpretation of the Cohen's k for this was ""very good concordance"". The RT-LAMP is an attractive approach for frequent individual testing in decentralized setups.","Roumani, Foteini; Azinheiro, Sarah; Sousa, Hugo; Sousa, Ana; Timóteo, Mafalda; Varandas, Tatiana; Fonseca-Silva, Daniela; Baldaque, Inês; Carvalho, Joana; Prado, Marta; Garrido-Maestu, Alejandro",Viruses,183,16

Aim of Study: Retrospective study aimed at correlating the maximum dose in planning target volume (PTV) with early effects of radiation. Materials and Methods: Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of H and N region who received radical radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy were retrospectively analyzed for maximum dose in PTV and the requirement of gap during radiotherapy or else hospitalization for supportive care during or up to 1 month after completion of radical radiotherapy. Results: Of a total of 23 patients, 8 patients (34.7%) required a gap of 2-14 days during their treatment. Twelve patients (52.1%) required hospitalization for 1-4 days and 4 patients (17.3%) required hospitalization for supportive care after completion of radiotherapy. The maximum dose in PTV ranged from 105.1% to 132.8% with an average of 112.68%. Subgroup analysis revealed a nonsignificant highest maximum dose of 114.72% in subset of patients requiring gap during radiotherapy (n= 8).

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and the correlates with the occurrence of PE as well as the association between PE and the risk of mortality in COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective multicenter study on consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized at 7 Italian Hospitals. At admission, all patients underwent medical history, laboratory and echocardiographic evaluation. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 224 patients (mean age 69 ± 14, male sex 62%); PE was diagnosed in 32 cases (14%). Patients with PE were hospitalized after a longer time since symptoms onset (7 IQR 3-11 days, 3 IQR 1-6 days; p = 0.001) and showed higher D-dimers level (1819 IQR 568-5017 ng/ml vs 555 IQR 13-1530 ng/ml; p < 0.001) and higher prevalence of myocardial injury (47% vs 28%, p = 0.033).

Correlative evidence suggests that the left posterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is responsible for the process underlying pitch labeling in AP. Here, we measured the sight-reading performance of right-handed AP possessors and matched controls under cathodal and sham transcranial direct current stimulation of the left DLPFC. The participants were instructed to report notations as accurately and as fast as possible by playing with their right hand on a piano. The notations were simultaneously presented with distracting auditory stimuli that either matched or mismatched them in different semitone degrees. Unlike the controls, AP possessors revealed an interference effect in that they responded slower in mismatching conditions than in the matching one. Under cathodal stimulation, this interference effect disappeared. These findings confirm that the pitch-labeling process underlying AP occurs automatically and is largely nonsuppressible when triggered by tone exposure. The improvement of the AP possessors' sight-reading performances in response to the suppression of the left DLPFC using cathodal stimulation confirms a causal relationship between this brain structure and pitch labeling.","Rogenmoser, Lars; Arnicane, Andra; Jäncke, Lutz; Elmer, Stefan",Ann.

We developed risk prediction models to identify patients with low risk for COVID-19 from this cohort of hospitalised patients with acute respiratory symptoms. METHODS: This was a single-centre retrospective observational study. Patients admitted to our institution's respiratory surveillance wards from 10 February to 30 April 2020 contributed data for analysis. Prediction models for COVID-19 were derived from a training cohort using variables based on demographics, clinical symptoms, exposure risks and blood investigations fitted into logistic regression models. The derived prediction models were subsequently validated on a test cohort. RESULTS: Of the 1,228 patients analysed, 52 (4.2%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Two prediction models were derived, the first based on age, presence of sore throat, dormitory residence, blood haemoglobin level (Hb), and total white blood cell counts (TW), and the second based on presence of headache, contact with infective patients, Hb and TW. Both models had good diagnostic performance with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.934 and 0.866, respectively. Risk score cut-offs of 0.6 for Model 1 and 0.2 for Model 2 had 100% sensitivity, allowing identification of patients with low risk for COVID-19. Limiting COVID-19 screening to only elevated-risk patients reduced the number of isolation days for surveillance patients by up to 41.7% and COVID-19 swab testing by up to 41.0%.

Students’ evaluation and admission to college at the time of COVID-19,16.404732,3.4026155,2021,"BACKGROUND: Autopsy is an important tool for understanding the pathogenesis of diseases, including COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: On 15 April 2020, together with the German Society of Pathology and the Federal Association of German Pathologists, the German Registry of COVID-19 Autopsies (DeRegCOVID) was launched ( www.DeRegCOVID.ukaachen.de ). Building on this, the German Network for Autopsies in Pandemics (DEFEAT PANDEMIcs) was established on 1 September 2020. RESULTS: The main goal of DeRegCOVID is to collect and distribute de facto anonymized data on potentially all autopsies of people who have died from COVID-19 in Germany in order to meet the need for centralized, coordinated, and structured data collection and reporting during the pandemic. The success of the registry strongly depends on the willingness of the respective centers to report the data, which has developed very positively so far and requires special thanks to all participating centers. The rights to own data and biomaterials (stored decentrally) remain with each respective center. The DEFEAT PANDEMIcs network expands on this and aims to strengthen harmonization and standardization as well as nationwide implementation and cooperation in the field of pandemic autopsies. CONCLUSIONS: The extraordinary cooperation in the field of autopsies in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic is impressively demonstrated by the establishment of DeRegCOVID, the merger of the registry of neuropathology (CNS-COVID19) with DeRegCOVID and the establishment of the autopsy network DEFEAT PANDEMIcs. It gives a strong signal for the necessity, readiness, and expertise to jointly help manage current and future pandemics by autopsy-derived knowledge.","von Stillfried, Saskia; Acker, Till; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Baretton, Gustavo; Bülow, Roman David; Bürrig, Karl-Friedrich; Holtherm, Hans-Ulrich; Jonigk, Danny; Knüchel, Ruth; Majeed, Raphael W; Röhrig, Rainer; Wienströer, Jan; Boor, Peter",Pathologe,183,15

As a result, university students undertaking the final year of education degrees (teaching placements) have been obliged to deliver their teaching from home, adapting their teaching contexts to learning in virtual settings. A novel instrument was designed and validated in order to analyze the impact of learning environments and psychological factors in university students during a period of teaching placements. This took place in an adaptive context (state of confinement). Associations were determined between learning environments and psychological factors in adaptive contexts, in relation to the group to which they belonged (whether undertaking a degree in primary education, physical education and sport, early education or social education), and sex. The present study used a Delphi method, alongside a descriptive and quantitative analysis. The data demonstrate that learning environments differ according to the degree studied. The four analyzed groups revealed significant differences in relation to learning environments and psychological factors in adaptive confinement contexts. The subjects of Primary and Social Education were seen to be related with a greater possibility of being overwhelmed and reporting difficulties. Those more used to physical exercise showed more positive psychological indices. Females reported more negative responses. The conclusion reached is that the results of the present research will enable future additional multi-dimensional analysis to be conducted.","Olmos-Gómez, María Del Carmen",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),183,16

The aim of this review article is to describe the current knowledge of COVID-19 in children regarding its prevalence, signs, symptoms, severity and the role of children in disease transmission. This article is based on a comprehensive review of PUbMED and Google Scholar for original articles, letters to editors, editorials, and case reports published from January to October 2020. It was concluded that Children of all age groups are susceptible to acquiring COVID-19 but will most likely be asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. Many explanations for this have been suggested, but the exact reason is not clear. Although children may show typical symptoms such as fever and cough, yet gastrointestinal involvement is much more common than in adults. Dry coughing is also lighter in children. There is no significant difference in prevalence between both sexes. Regarding transmission, it has not been confirmed whether COVID-19 is often transmitted from children to adults, but it is wise for families and their COVID-19 affected children to follow preventive measures to help stop COVID-19 from spreading.","Lingawi, H.

Investigating the mechanical properties of glass is challenging because any global deformation that might result in shear rejuvenation would require a prohibitively long relaxation time. Moreover, glass is well known to be heterogeneous, and a global perturbation would prevent exploration of local mechanical/transport properties. However, investigation based on a local probe, i.e., microrheology, may overcome these problems. Here, we establish active microrheology of a bulk metallic glass, via a probe particle driven into host medium glass. This technique is amenable to experimental investigations via nanoindentation tests. We provide distinct evidence of a strong relationship between the microscopic dynamics of the probe particle and the macroscopic properties of the host medium glass. These findings establish active microrheology as a promising technique for investigating the local properties of bulk metallic glass.","Yu, Ji Woong; Rahbari, S H E; Kawasaki, Takeshi; Park, Hyunggyu; Lee, Won Bo",Sci Adv,183,26

OBJECTIVE: Determine the association between county-level proportion of non-Hispanic Black (NHB) on county COVID-19 case and death rates and observe how this association was influenced by county sociodemographic and health care infrastructure characteristics. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was an ecologic analysis of US counties as of September 20, 2020, that employed stepwise construction of linear and negative binomial regression models. The primary independent variable was the proportion of NHB population in the county. Covariates included county demographic composition, proportion uninsured, proportion living in crowded households, proportion living in poverty, population density, state testing rate, Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Area status, and hospital beds per 1000 population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were exponentiated COVID-19 cases per 100 000 population and COVID-19 deaths per 100 000 population. We produced county-level maps of the measures of interest. RESULTS: In total, 3044 of 3142 US counties were included. Bivariate relationships between the proportion of NHB in a county and county COVID-19 case (Exp ß = 1.026; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.024-1.028; P < .001) and death rates (rate ratio [RR] = 1.032; 95% CI, 1.029-1.035; P < .001) were not attenuated in fully adjusted models. The adjusted association between the proportion of NHB population in a county and county COVID-19 case was Exp ß = 1.025 (95% CI, 1.023-1.027; P < .001) and the association with county death rates was RR = 1.034 (95% CI, 1.031-1.038; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of NHB people in a county was positively associated with county COVID-19 case and death rates and did not change in models that accounted for other socioecologic and health care infrastructure characteristics that have been hypothesized to account for the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on racial and ethnic minority populations.

No specific antiviral treatment is currently available. The purpose of this review is to highlight the main repurposed drug treatments with in-vitro or in-vivo efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent clinical trials suggested remdesivir, IFN-ß-1b and favipiravir have potential clinical and/or virological benefits on patients with COVID-19. Short course of stress dose of corticosteroids might be used as adjunctive treatment to patients who are late presenters with cytokine storm. Convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients with high neutralizing antibody might also be beneficial in the treatment of severe disease. SUMMARY: Early effective antiviral therapy in COVID-19 patients will suppress the SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Adjunctive therapy with corticosteroid and convalescent plasma might further ameliorate the cytokine response. Further randomized clinical trials of combination therapy are needed.","Hung, Ivan F N",Curr Opin HIV AIDS,183,20

Our objective was to evaluate mental health symptoms and identify associated determinants among cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. METHODS: We used nationally representative data of 10,760 US adults from the COVID-19 Impact Survey. We defined cancer survivors as adults with a self-reported diagnosis of cancer (n = 854, 7.6%). We estimated associations of mental health symptoms among cancer survivors using multinomial logistic regression. We estimated determinants of reporting at least one mental health symptom 3-7 times in the 7 days before survey administration among cancer survivors using multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: Cancer survivors were more likely to report feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.90); depressed (aOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.09); lonely (aOR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.91); and hopeless (aOR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.06) 3-7 days per week in the last 7 days when compared with adults without cancer. Among cancer survivors, adults of age 30-44 years (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 1.87; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.95), females (aPR, 1.55, 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.13), adults without a high school degree (aPR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.05 to 3.04), and adults with limited social interaction (aPR, 1.40, 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.95) were more likely to report at least one mental health-related symptom in the last 7 days (3-7 days/week). CONCLUSION: Cancer survivors are reporting mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly young adults, adults without a high school degree, women, and survivors with limited social support.","Islam, Jessica Yasmine; Vidot, Denise C; Camacho-Rivera, Marlene",JCO Oncol Pract,183,16

We propose a cross-lingual data selection method to extract in-domain sentences in the missing language side from a large generic monolingual corpus. Our proposed method trains an adaptive layer on top of multilingual BERT by contrastive learning to align the representation between the source and target language. This then enables the transferability of the domain classifier between the languages in a zero-shot manner. Once the in-domain data is detected by the classifier, the NMT model is then adapted to the new domain by jointly learning translation and domain discrimination tasks. We evaluate our cross-lingual data selection method on NMT across five diverse domains in three language pairs, as well as a real-world scenario of translation for COVID-19. The results show that our proposed method outperforms other selection baselines up to +1.5 BLEU score.","Vu, Thuy-Trang; He, Xuanli; Phung, Dinh; Haffari, Gholamreza",,183,13

In addition, tetraspanin CD81 regulates HIV reverse transcription through its association with the dNTP hydrolase SAMHD1. Here we aimed at analysing the role of CD81 in Herpes simplex virus 1 infectivity using a neuroblastoma cell model. For this purpose, we generated a CD81 KO cell line using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Despite being CD81 a plasma membrane protein, CD81 KO cells showed no defects in viral entry nor in the expression of early protein markers. In contrast, glycoprotein B and C, which require viral DNA replication for their expression, were significantly reduced in CD81 KO infected cells. Indeed, HSV-1 DNA replication and the formation of new infectious particles were severely compromised in CD81 KO cells. We could not detect significant changes in SAMHD1 total expression levels, but a relocalization into endosomal structures was observed in CD81 KO cells. In summary, CD81 KO cells showed impaired viral DNA replication and produced greatly diminished viral titers.","Benayas, Beatriz; Sastre, Isabel; López-Martín, Soraya; Oo, Adrian; Kim, Baek; Bullido, Maria J; Aldudo, Jesús; Yáñez-Mó, María",Med Microbiol Immunol,183,16

However, the resistance to certain types of devices in the classroom has contributed to the slow uptake of widespread use of electronic technology and the online environment as a mode for teaching and learning. The closure of schools due to the advent of COVID-19 pandemic forced education systems in the region to turn to the online environment to engage students in educational activities.

METHOD: A 58-item anonymous online survey was distributed during the period 30th April to 10th May via Qualtrics. The survey explored: a) demographic characteristics (age, sex, general health and where they were living during lockdown), b) changes in their contact lens use during lockdown, c) hygiene and contact lens compliance and d) concerns associated with contact lens wear and ways to support wearers during the pandemic. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty responses were analysed (38.8â¯±â¯11.4 years old, 75% female). Three-quarters of participants reported that they were self-isolating or rigorously following social distancing advice. Sixty-seven percent of participants reported using their contact lenses less during the pandemic. Respondents were found to be compliant with handwashing prior to inserting and removing contact lenses (in both cases 97% doing this 'most times' or 'every time'). However, only 44 % complied with the '20â¯s rule' and 48 % used a shared towel to dry their hands. A higher proportion of hydrogen peroxide users replaced the lens case monthly compared to multi-purpose users (64% vs.49%; pâ¯<â¯0.001). Twenty-four percent admitted wearing lenses whilst showering and 16% did not consider ceasing lens wear if feeling unwell with flu/cold symptoms. CONCLUSION: Eye care practitioners should continue to educate contact lens wearers to ensure safe contact lens wear to minimise the chance of developing contact lens related complications during the pandemic. Modifiable factors that need particular attention in Spain include: handwashing for at least 20s before lens handling, drying hands with single use paper towels, including a rub-and-rinse step for reusable lenses, lens case cleaning and renewal, avoidance of water exposure and when to cease lens wear during the pandemic.","Vianya-Estopa, Marta; Garcia-Porta, Nery; Piñero, David P; Simo Mannion, Luisa; Beukes, Eldre W; Wolffsohn, James S; Allen, Peter M",,183,20

This study was carried out in 15 Muhammadiyah-'Aisyiyah-affiliated COVID-19 referral hospitals in Indonesia. Four hundred ninety participants who tested positive for the COVID-19 were recruited in this study. Demographic data, history of chronic diseases, and the development of ARDS were retrieved from hospital patient records. Information about the smoking behavior was collected after respondents were discharged from the hospital. Presence of chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic heart disease, hypertension, and chronic liver diseases were significantly associated with the development of ARDS. In a similar regard, patients who currently smoked had a 5 times greater risk of developing ARDS compared with those who never smoked.","Rachmawati, Emma; Listiowati, Ekorini; Kurniawan, Deni Wahyudi; Suraya, Izza; Ahsan, Abdillah; Nurmansyah, Mochamad Iqbal",Asia Pac J Public Health,183,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cohort study included 115 adult patients admitted to the ICU with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Anthropometric variables and biochemical (C-reactive protein, ferritin, leukocyte, neutrophils, and fibrinogen) were measured. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations. RESULTS: Mean age was 50.6±11.2 years, 68.7% were male. Median BMI was 30.9kg/m2. All patients had invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients with diabetes had increased risk of mortality with OR of 2.86 (CI 95% 1.1-7.4, p=0.026); among those patients who, in addition to diabetes had obesity, the risk was de 3.17 (CI 95% 1.9-10.2, p=0.038). Patients with obesity had 1.25 times greater risk of developing a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (95% CI 1.09-1.46, p=0.025). Negative correlation was observed between BMI and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio (r=-0.023, p<0.05). Obese patients required more days of mechanical ventilation and longer hospital stay compared to non-obese patients. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes and obesity are risk factors for increasing severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and they are both associated with an increase in mortality.","Pérez-Cruz, Elizabeth; Castañón-González, Jorge Alberto; Ortiz-Gutiérrez, Salvador; Garduño-López, Jessica; Luna-Camacho, Yuritzy",Obes Res Clin Pract,183,6

In the current emergent situation, drug repurposing of well-known traditional and/or approved drugs could be the most effective strategy. Herein, through computational approaches, we aimed to screen 14 natural compounds from limonoids and terpenoids class for their ability to inhibit the key therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Among these, some limonoids, namely deacetylnomilin, ichangin and nomilin, and the terpenoid ß-amyrin provided good interaction energies with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) in molecular dynamic simulation. Interestingly, deacetylnomilin and ichangin showed direct interaction with the catalytic dyad of the enzyme so supporting their potential role in preventing SARS-CoV-2 replication and growth. On the contrary, despite the good affinity with the spike protein RBD site, all the selected phytochemicals lose contact with the amino acid residues over the course of 120ns-long molecular dynamics simulations therefore suggesting they scarcely can interfere in SARS-CoV-2 binding to the ACE2 receptor. The in silico analyses of docking score and binding energies, along with predicted pharmacokinetic profiles, indicate that these triterpenoids might have potential as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, recommending further in vitro and in vivo investigations for a complete understanding and confirmation of their inhibitory potential.","Giofrè, Salvatore Vincenzo; Napoli, Edoardo; Iraci, Nunzio; Speciale, Antonio; Cimino, Francesco; Muscarà, Claudia; Molonia, Maria Sofia; Ruberto, Giuseppe; Saija, Antonella",Comput Biol Med,183,29

Cases newly diagnosed with COVID-19 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from January 2020 to February 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from throat swab sample &#916;CT values; lymphocyte and lymphocyte subset counts, coagulation system factor levels, myocardial injury indexes, and laboratory biochemical indicators were compared between the mild group and the severe group. The correlation between the relative load of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA and severe disease symptoms was analyzed. Of the 76 patients, 49 were male and 27 were female. The lymphocyte, CD4+ T lymphocyte, and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts all differed significantly between the two groups (p < 0.001), as did differences in interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, and IL-8 levels (p = 0.022, 0.026, and 0.012, respectively). Moreover, there were significant differences in prothrombin time, D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels between the mild group and the severe group (p = 0.029, 0.006, and <0.001, respectively), and in lactate dehydrogenase and troponin (p < 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 RNA load and lymphocyte count, CD4+ T lymphocyte count, and CD8+ T lymphocyte count were linearly negatively correlated (p < 0.001). SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was positively correlated with IL-2R, prothrombin time, lactate dehydrogenase, and hypersensitive troponin T (p = 0.002, p = 0.009, and p < 0.001, respectively). In addition, the time that it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was significantly shorter for patients in the mild group than for those in the severe group (Z = -6.713, p < 0.001). In conclusion, relative SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in the nasopharynx is closely related to COVID-19 severity. If the relative RNA load was higher, the lymphocyte count was lower, organ damage was greater, and the time it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was longer.","Liu, Yang; Liao, Wenjian; Wan, Lagen; Xiang, Tianxing; Zhang, Wei",Viral immunol,183,1

The treatment of critically ill patients is a challenging task, without identified credible predictors of mortality. Methods: We performed an analysis of 160 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit between June 23, 2020, and October 2, 2020, in University Hospital Center Bezanijska kosa, Belgrade, Serbia. Patients on invasive, noninvasive ventilation and high flow oxygen therapy with moderate to severe ARDS, according to the Berlin definition of ARDS, were selected for the study. Demographic data, past medical history, laboratory values, and CT severity score were analyzed to identify predictors of mortality. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess potential predictors of mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Results: The mean patient age was 65.6 years (range, 29-92 years), predominantly men, 68.8%. 107 (66.9%) patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation, 31 (19.3%) on noninvasive, and 22 (13.8%) on high flow oxygen therapy machine. The median total number of ICU days was 10 (25th to 75th percentile: 6-18), while the median total number of hospital stay was 18 (25th to 75th percentile: 12-28). The mortality rate was 60% (96/160). Univariate logistic regression analysis confirmed the significance of age, CRP, and lymphocytes at admission to hospital, serum albumin, D-dimer, and IL-6 at admission to ICU, and CT score. Serum albumin, D-dimer, and IL-6 at admission to ICU were independently associated with mortality in the final multivariate analysis. Conclusion: In the present study of 160 consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe ARDS, IL-6, serum albumin, and D-dimer at admission to ICU, accompanied by chest CT severity score, were marked as independent predictors of mortality.","Popadic, Viseslav; Klasnja, Slobodan; Milic, Natasa; Rajovic, Nina; Aleksic, Aleksandra; Milenkovic, Marija; Crnokrak, Bogdan; Balint, Bela; Todorovic-Balint, Milena; Mrda, Davor; Zdravkovic, Darko; Toskovic, Borislav; Brankovic, Marija; Markovic, Olivera; Bjekic-Macut, Jelica; Djuran, Predrag; Memon, Lidija; Brajkovic, Milica; Todorovic, Zoran; Hadzi-Djokic, Jovan; Jovanovic, Igor; Nikolic, Dejan; Zdravkovic, Marija",Oxid Med Cell Longev,183,10

Data obtained during this period were compared with the emergencies attended in the same period of 2019. A total of 213 psychiatric emergencies were attended in 2020 compared with 367 in 2019. The mean number of emergencies per day was significantly lower during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 (M=4.35, SD= 2.04) vs. the same period in 2019 (M=7.50, SD= 3.18). A higher percentage of patients with schizo/psychotic disorders (34.3% in 2020, vs. 24.3% in 2019), as well as a lower percentage of patients with anxiety/adaptive disorders (25.4% in 2020 vs. 35.4% in 2019) was observed during the outbreak.

Previously, it has been reported that the plasma concentrations of lopinavir significantly increase in inflammatory settings. As COVID-19 may be associated with major inflammation, assessing the plasma concentrations and safety of lopinavir in COVID-19 patients is essential. METHODS: Real-world COVID-19 data based on a retrospective study. RESULTS: Among the 31 COVID-19 patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir between March 18, 2020 and April 1, 2020, it was observed higher lopinavir plasma concentrations, which increased by 4.6-fold (interquartile range: 3.6-6.2), as compared to the average plasma concentrations in HIV. Lopinavir concentrations in all except one patient were above the upper limit of the concentration range of HIV treatment. Approximately one to five patients prematurely stopped treatment mainly due to an ADR related to hepatic or gastrointestinal disorders. CONCLUSION: Lopinavir plasma concentrations in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 were higher than expected, and they were associated with the occurrence of hepatic or gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions. However, a high plasma concentration may be required for in vivo antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, as suggested by previous studies. Therefore, in the absence of adverse drug reaction, lopinavir dosage should not be reduced. Cautionu is essential because off-label use can be associated with a new drug safety profile.","Chouchana, Laurent; Boujaafar, Sana; Gana, Ines; Preta, Laure-Hélène; Regard, Lucile; Legendre, Paul; Azoulay, Celia; Canouï, Etienne; Zerbit, Jeremie; Carlier, Nicolas; Terrier, Benjamin; Kernéis, Solen; Batista, Rui; Treluyer, Jean-Marc; Zheng, Yi; Benaboud, Sihem",Ther. drug monit,183,20

METHODS: A total of 40 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Baseline clinical data, CT images, and laboratory testing results were collected from all patients. We defined that ROIs in the absorption group decreased in the density and scope in GGO, and ROIs in the progress group progressed to consolidation. A total of 180 ROIs from absorption group (n = 118) and consolidation group (n = 62) were randomly divided into a training set (n = 145) and a validation set (n = 35) (8:2). Radiomics features were extracted from CT images, and the radiomics-based models were built with three classifiers. A radiomics score (Rad-score) was calculated by a linear combination of selected features. The Rad-score and clinical factors were incorporated into the radiomics nomogram construction. The prediction performance of the clinical factors model and the radiomics nomogram for prognosis was estimated. RESULTS: A total of 15 radiomics features with respective coefficients were calculated. The AUC values of radiomics models (kNN, SVM, and LR) were 0.88, 0.88, and 0.84, respectively, showing a good performance. The C-index of the clinical factors model was 0.82 [95% CI (0.75-0.88)] in the training set and 0.77 [95% CI (0.59-0.90)] in the validation set. The radiomics nomogram showed optimal prediction performance. In the training set, the C-index was 0.91 [95% CI (0.85-0.95)], and in the validation set, the C-index was 0.85 [95% CI (0.69-0.95)]. For the training set, the C-index of the radiomics nomogram was significantly higher than the clinical factors model (p = 0.0021). Decision curve analysis showed that radiomics nomogram outperformed the clinical model in terms of clinical usefulness. CONCLUSIONS: The radiomics nomogram based on CT images showed favorable prediction performance in the prognosis of COVID-19. The radiomics nomogram could be used as a potential biomarker for more accurate categorization of patients into different stages for clinical decision-making process. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Radiomics features based on chest CT images help clinicians to categorize the patients of COVID-19 into different stages. Radiomics nomogram based on CT images has favorable predictive performance in the prognosis of COVID-19.

Many preparation methods are known to yield two-dimensional carbon materials which are often simply addressed as graphene, but which show huge variations in their physical and chemical properties and therefore on their sensing performance. The first section briefly reviews the most promising as well as the latest achievements in graphene synthesis based on growth and delamination techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition, liquid phase exfoliation via sonication or mechanical forces, as well as oxidative procedures ranging from chemical to electrochemical exfoliation. Two-dimensional carbon materials are highly attractive to be integrated in a wide field of sensing applications. Here, graphene is examined as recognition layer in electrochemical sensors like field-effect transistors, chemiresistors, impedance-based devices as well as voltammetric and amperometric sensors. The sensor performance is evaluated from the material's perspective of view and revealed the impact of structure and defects of the 2D carbon materials in different transducing technologies. It is concluded that the performance of 2D carbon-based sensors is strongly related to the preparation method in combination with the electrical transduction technique.

The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors for in-hospital death of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICUs of a University Hospital in Egypt. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted between April 28 and July 29, 2020 to two ICUs dedicated to the isolation and treatment of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Cairo University Hospitals. Diagnosis was confirmed in all patients using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on respiratory samples and radiologic evidence of pneumonia. RESULTS: Of the 177 patients admitted to the ICUs during the study period, 160 patients had COVID-19 pneumonia and were included in the analysis (mean age: 60 ± 14 years, 67.5% males); 23% of patients had no known comorbidities. The overall ICU and hospital mortality rates were both 24.4%. The ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 7 (25-75% interquartile range: 4-10) and 10 (25-75% interquartile range: 7-14) days, respectively. In a multivariable analysis with in-hospital death as the dependent variable, ischemic heart disease, history of smoking, and secondary bacterial pneumonia were independently associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death, whereas greater PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission to the ICU was associated with a lower risk. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, ischemic heart disease, history of smoking, and secondary bacterial pneumonia were independently associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death.","Nassar, Yasser; Mokhtar, Ahmed; Elhadidy, Amr; Elsayed, Marwa; Mostafa, Farouk; Rady, Ashraf; Eladawy, Akram; Elshazly, Mostafa; Saeed, Mohamed; Mokhtar, Sherif; Buschbeck, Samuel; Sakr, Yasser",J. infect. public health,183,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 participants, average age 13.1 years, were enrolled. At baseline, second molars were randomized into test and control, and assessed by ICDAS, SOPROLIFE, and DIAGNOdent. An independent investigator irradiated test molars with a CO2 laser (wavelength 9.3 µm, pulse duration 4 µs, pulse repetition rate 43 Hz, beam diameter 250 µm, average fluence 3.9 J/cm2, 20 laser pulses per spot). Test molars received laser and fluoride treatment, control teeth fluoride alone. Fluoride varnish was applied at baseline and at 6 months. After 6 and 12 months, teeth were again assessed. RESULTS: A total of 57 participants completed the 6-month and 51 the 12-month recall. Laser-treated surfaces showed very slight ICDAS improvements over time with ICDAS change - 1 in 11% and 8%, no changes (ICDAS change 0) in 68% and 67%, and slightly worsened (ICDAS change 1) in 19% and 24% at 6- and 12-month recalls, respectively, and worsened by two scores in 2% at both recall time points. Control teeth showed significantly higher ICDAS increases, with 47% and 25% showing ICDAS change 0, ICDAS change 1 in 49% and 55%, and ICDAS change 2 in 4% and 20% at 6- and 12-month recalls, respectively. Differences in ICDAS changes between the groups were statistically significant (P = 0.0002 and P < 0.0001; Wilcoxon's signed-rank test, exact). A total of 22% of the participants developed ICDAS 3 scores on the control teeth. CONCLUSIONS: Microsecond short-pulsed 9.3-µm CO2 laser irradiation markedly inhibits caries progression in pits and fissures in comparison with fluoride varnish alone.

It is well known that an increase of fibrinogen concentration, an aggregation-inducing protein for erythrocytes, leads to an increase of the sedimentation rate of erythrocytes, which is generally explained through the formation and faster settling of large disjoint aggregates. However, many aspects of erythrocyte sedimentation conform well with the collapse of a colloidal gel rather than with the sedimentation of disjoint aggregates. Using experiments and cell-level numerical simulations, we systematically investigate the dependence of ESR on fibrinogen concentration and its relation to the microstructure of the gel-like erythrocyte suspension. We show that for physiological aggregation interactions, an increase in the attraction strength between cells results in a cell network with larger void spaces. This geometrical change in the network structure occurs due to anisotropic shape and deformability of erythrocytes and leads to an increased gel permeability and faster sedimentation. Our results provide a comprehensive relation between the ESR and the cell-level structure of erythrocyte suspensions and support the gel hypothesis in the interpretation of blood sedimentation.","Dasanna, Anil Kumar; Darras, Alexis; John, Thomas; Gompper, Gerhard; Kaestner, Lars; Wagner, Christian; Fedosov, Dmitry A.",,183,20

Respiratory infectious diseases affect not only the person infected but also the family members and the society. As medical sciences advance, several diseases have been conquered; however, the impact of novel infectious diseases on the society is enormous. As the clinical presentation of respiratory infections is similar regardless of the pathogen, the causative agent is not distinguishable by symptoms alone. Moreover, it is difficult to develop a cure because of the various viral mutations. Various respiratory infectious diseases ranging from influenza, which threaten the health of mankind globally, to the coronavirus disease 2019, which resulted in a pandemic, exist. Contrary to human expectations that development in health care and improvement in hygiene will conquer infectious diseases, humankind's health and social systems are threatened by novel infectious diseases. Owing to the development of transport and trading activity, the rate of spread of new infectious diseases is increasing. As respiratory infections can threaten the members of the global community at any time, investigations on preventing the transmission of these diseases as well as development of effective antivirals and vaccines are of utmost importance and require a worldwide effort.","Kim, Hyun Jung",,183,16

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the coagulation profile in a series of healthy subjects who received the first dose of the BNT162b2 or the ChAdOx1 vaccines and assessed whether hypercoagulability developed. PATIENTS/METHODS: Volunteers among the staff of the University of Padua or health care professionals in the Padua University Hospital who had received either the ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccine in the previous 10 ± 2 days were eligible. A cohort of unvaccinated volunteers among family members of the University staff acted as control group. Global coagulation monitoring was assessed by whole blood rotational thromboelastometry, whole blood impedance aggregometry and thrombin generation. Platelet count was also obtained. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety subjects were enrolled: 101 (53.2%) received the ChAdOx1 vaccine and 89 (46.8%) the BNT162b2 vaccine. Twenty-eight non-vaccinated subjects acted as controls. Thromboelastometry parameters were all comparable among groups. Thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP)-, ADP- and ASPI-induced platelet aggregation were similar among groups, as well as platelet count. Endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) was comparable among groups. The results were confirmed after controlling for age, gender and hormonal. Considering women taking combined oral contraceptives or thrombophilia carriers, no differences were detected in thromboelastometry or thrombin generation parameters between subjects who received ChAdOx1 vs. BNT162b2 vaccines.

Despite rigorous efforts worldwide to control the spread and human to human transmission of this virus, incidence and death due to COVID-19 continue to rise. Several drugs have been tested for treatment of COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine. While a number of studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine can prolong QT interval, potentially increasing risk of ventricular arrhythmias and Torsade de Pointes, its effects on immune cell function have not been extensively examined. In the current review, an overview of coronaviruses, viral entry and pathogenicity, immunity upon coronavirus infection, and current therapy options for COVID-19 are briefly discussed. Further based on preclinical studies, we provide evidences that i) hydroxychloroquine impairs autophagy, which leads to accumulation of damaged/oxidized cytoplasmic constituents and interferes with cellular homeostasis, ii) this impaired autophagy in part reduces antigen processing and presentation to immune cells and iii) inhibition of endosome-lysosome system acidification by hydroxychloroquine not only impairs the phagocytosis process, but also potentially alters pulmonary surfactant in the lungs. Therefore, it is likely that hydroxychloroquine treatment may in fact impair host immunity in response to SARS-CoV-2, especially in elderly patients or those with co-morbidities.

METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in five databases. Randomized (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials of interventions (non-RCTs) for the surgical or non-surgical treatment of patients with traumatic or atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears were included. The review protocol was published in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42018100343). RESULTS: Ten studies (three RCTs with 332 participants; seven non-RCTs with 650 participants) met the inclusion criteria. One year after treatment, shoulder function, measured with the 100-point Constant score, had improved by 6.7 points (95% confidence interval [2.3; 11.0]) and pain, measured with the 10-cm visual analog scale, by 1.1 cm (0.5; 1.7] in the full-thickness rotator cuff tears treated surgically compared with non-surgical treatment. In one study the difference in favor of surgery persisted after 10 years' follow-up. For other outcomes, such as range of motion, muscle strength, quality of life, and adverse events, the data were sparse and the group differences were similar. The findings of the non-RCTs were comparable with those of the RCTs. CONCLUSION: With regard to functional improvement and pain reduction, surgical treatment of full-thickness rotator cuff tears was superior to non-surgical treatment in the short and the long term. Whether the differences between the groups are relevant for individual cases is uncertain, as the measured results were distributed below and above the threshold of clinical relevance. The conclusions may not be applicable to rotator cuff tears over 3 cm in size or to young persons.","Schmucker, Christine; Titscher, Viktoria; Braun, Cordula; Nussbaumer-Streit, Barbara; Gartlehner, Gerald; Meerpohl, Jörg",Dtsch Arztebl Int,183,24

METHODS: We used a structured protocol to synthesize evidence from previous systematic reviews focused on surgical education alongside a series of focused original educational studies. This approach allowed incorporation of prospectively applied novel ideas into the existing landscape of published evidence. All material used for this proof of concept derives from the outputs of a dedicated research network for surgical education (eMERG). RESULTS: We propose the foundation blueprint framework called ""Omnigon iG4"" as a globally applicable model. It allows adaptation to individual local educational environments for designing, appraising and/or refining surgical curricula. We also describe the ""Omnigon iG4 Hexagon Pragmatic Model,"" a novel perspective model which assesses the performance of our blueprint in a multi-layer fashion. This ""Hexagon"" model is the first to introduce pragmatic outcomes in curricula performance assessment. CONCLUSIONS: This proof of concept, ""Omnigon iG4,"" proposes an adaptable version of a curriculum blueprint. The framework allows educators to establish a surgical curriculum with the ability to map out competencies, permitting full control over their intended learning outcomes.

Justice is clearly at stake, but it is unclear what justice requires in the international distribution of a scarce vaccine during a pandemic. Many are condemning 'vaccine nationalism' as an obstacle to equitable global distribution. We argue that limited national partiality in allocating vaccines will be a component of justice rather than an obstacle to it. For there are role-based and community-embedded responsibilities to take care of one's own, which constitute legitimate moral reasons for some identity-related prioritisation. Furthermore, a good form of vaccine nationalism prioritises one's own without denying or ignoring duties derived from a principle of equal worth, according to which all persons, regardless of citizenship or identity, equally deserve vaccine-induced protection from COVID-19. Rather than dismissing nationalism as a tragic obstacle, it is necessary to acknowledge that a limited form of it is valuable and expresses moral commitments. Only then can one understand our world of competing obligations, a world where cosmopolitan duties of benevolence sometimes conflict with special obligations of community membership. Once these competing obligations are recognised as such, we can begin the work of designing sound ethical frameworks for achieving justice in the global distribution of a coronavirus vaccine and developing practical strategies for avoiding, mitigating or resolving conflicts of duty.","Ferguson, Kyle; Caplan, Arthur",J. med. ethics,183,1

A number of scholars have called for more in-depth critical research on COVID-19 and health inequalities to produce a strong empirical evidence based on these issues. There are also justifiable concerns about the scarcity of health-equity actions oriented analyses of the situation and calls for more empirical evidence on COVID-19 and health inequalities. A preliminary condition to establish this type of information is strong capacity to conduct health inequalities research. Worldwide, however, this type of capacity is limited, which, alongside other challenges, will likely hinder capacities of many countries to develop comprehensive equity-oriented COVID-19 analyses, and adequate responses to present and future crises. The current pandemic reinforces the pending need to invest in and strengthen these research capacities. These capacities must be supported by widespread recognition and concern, cognitive social capital, and greater commitment to coordinated, transparent action, and responsibility.

RECENT FINDINGS: Given significant overlap in symptoms, care must be taken to differentiate routine allergic conditions from COVID-19 infection but it appears that most allergic diseases are not risk factors for a severe COVID-19 course. The full impact of restricted allergy/immunology ambulatory services will take months to years to fully understand. One benefit of having to adapt practice style is greater awareness and acceptance of shared decision-making and recognition of preference-sensitive care options in food allergy, in particular for approaches towards allergy prevention, treatment, and anaphylaxis care. Social distancing and masks have helped reduce spread of common respiratory viruses, which may be helping to lower the incidence of viral-associated wheezing episodes, enhancing evidence of the effects of preventing exposure of young children to respiratory viruses on asthma pathogenesis, as well as on allergic rhinitis. There has been a revolution in the rise of telemedicine to increase access to high-quality allergy/immunology specialty care.

Several studies have already applied this method by using an exposure and response prevention-inspired serious game to treat patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a mobile cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program would be as effective in treating OCD as traditional offline CBT. In addition, the treatment efficacy in response to mobile CBT for OCD might be associated with increased brain activity within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) tract. METHODS: The digital CBT treatment program for OCD, OCfree, consists of 6 education sessions, 10 quests, and 7 casual games. Information was gathered from 27 patients with OCD (15 offline CBT and 12 OCfree CBT). During the 6-week intervention period, changes in clinical symptoms and brain function activity were analyzed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the change in OCD symptoms and depressive symptoms between the two groups. However, the OCfree group showed greater improvement in anxiety symptoms compared to the offline CBT group. Both offline CBT and OCfree CBT increased the functional connectivity within the CSTC tract in all patients with OCD. However, CBT using OCfree showed greater changes in brain connectivity within the thalamus and insula, compared to offline CBT. CONCLUSIONS: OCfree, an OCD treatment app program, was effective in the treatment of drug-naïve patients with OCD. The treatment effects of OCfree are associated with increased brain connectivity within the CSTC tract. Multisensory stimulation by education, quests, and games in OCfree increases the activity within the thalamus and insula in patients with OCD.","Hwang, Hyunchan; Bae, Sujin; Hong, Ji Sun; Han, Doug Hyun",JMIR Ment Health,183,4

Herein, we selected two Middle East countries; Egypt and Saudi Arabia to investigate the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on their HCWs. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a Google survey was used to access HCWs in many hospitals in Egypt and Saudi Arabia between the 14th and 24th of April 2020. The survey assessed HCWs regarding their sociodemographic and occupational features, sleeping hours, and psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). RESULTS: This study included 426 HCWs (48.4% physicians, 24.2% nurses, and 27.4% other HCWs). Of them, 69% had depression, 58.9% had anxiety, 55.9% had stress, and 37.3% had inadequate sleeping (<6 h/day). Female sex, age &#8804;30 years, working in Egypt, attending emergency and night shifts, watching/reading COVID-19 news &#8805;2 h/day, and not getting emotional support from family, society, and hospital were associated with a high likelihood of depression, anxiety, stress, and inadequate sleeping. LIMITATIONS: the cross-sectional design restricted our ability to distinguish between preexisting and emerging psychological symptoms.

There is no 'one-size-fits-all' solution that addresses nutrition. In relevance to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic crisis, viral infections in general and RNA viruses in particular are known to induce and promote oxidative stress, consequently increasing the body's demand for micronutrients, especially those related to antioxidant enzymic systems, thus draining the body of micronutrients, and so hindering the human body's ability to cope optimally with oxidative stress. Common polymorphisms in major antioxidant enzymes, with world population minor allele frequencies ranging from 0·5 to 50 %, are related to altered enzymic function, with substantial potential effects on the body's ability to cope with viral infection-induced oxidative stress. In this review we highlight common SNP of the major antioxidant enzymes relevant to nutritional components in the context of viral infections, namely: superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidases and catalase. We delineate functional polymorphisms in several human antioxidant enzymes that require, especially during a viral crisis, adequate and potentially additional nutritional support to cope with the pathological consequences of disease. Thus, in face of the COVID-19 pandemic, nutrition should be tightly monitored and possibly supplemented, with special attention to those carrying common polymorphisms in antioxidant enzymes.","Birk, Ruth",Nutr Res Rev,183,19

However, the key genes involved in ccRCC metastasis remain largely unknown. Purpose: The identification of the aberrant gene expression patterns associated with metastatic traits is of great clinical significance. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance and function of PDE7B in ccRCC. Materials and Methods: Expression profiling data for patient-matched primary and metastatic ccRCC tumors were obtained from GEO Dataset. Limma package was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the metastatic and the primary groups. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes Genomes (KEGG), and PPI network analysis were used to study the interacting activities and the interconnection of the DEGs. CCK-8 assays and Transwell assays were performed to detect the proliferation and migration of renal cancer cells. Results: We obtained 163 DEGs, including 132 that were upregulated and 31 that were downregulated in metastatic ccRCC tissues. Both Gene Ontology function and KEGG pathway analysis showed that DEGs were involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and cell adhesion. After utilizing PPI network to explore the interconnection among the DEGs, 22 genes were selected as the hub genes. Subsequently, survival analysis revealed that seven hub genes (SFN, NKX2-1, HP, MAPT, EPHA4, KCNAB1, and PDE7B) were significantly associated with overall survival disease-specific survival, and progression-free interval in ccRCC. Moreover, the low expression of PDE7B was found in clinical ccRCC samples and correlated with TNM stage and histologic grade. We further showed that knockdown of PDE7B increased cell growth and migration of renal cancer cells. Conclusion: Our results implicated that PDE7B may play a key role in the development of metastatic RCC.","Sun, Yi; Zou, Junxia; Ouyang, Wei; Chen, Ke",Cancer Manag Res,183,24

Person-to-person transmission through infected respiratory droplets from patients with symptoms and asymptomatic carriers is the main mode of spread in the community. There is currently no standard agreed upon drug to treat the disease and the prospect of having a safe and efficacious vaccine might be years away.

To avoid personal protective equipment (PPE) shortage crisis for medical staff and other frontline workers, health authorities are recommending the use cloth masks. Although in theory, cloth masks can be helpful to limit the spread of the COVID-19, serious consideration should be given to the choice of textile, the number of layers of cloth used, pre-treatment of the material with water repellent material and other compounds that can enhance the filtration efficiency of the masks without compromising their breathability.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Five designated tertiary hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei province, China. PARTICIPANTS: We routinely collected medical data of 1364 confirmed adult patients with COVID-19 between 8 January and 19 March 2020. Among them, 1088 patients from two designated hospitals in Wuhan were used to develop the prognostic model, and 276 patients from three hospitals outside Wuhan were used for external validation. All patients were followed up for a maximal of 60 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: The model discrimination was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Somers' D test, and calibration was examined by the calibration plot. Decision curve analysis was conducted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 60 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: The full model included seven predictors of age, respiratory failure, white cell count, lymphocytes, platelets, D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase. The simple model contained five indicators of age, respiratory failure, coronary heart disease, renal failure and heart failure. After cross-validation, the AUC statistics based on derivation cohort were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.97) for the full model and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89 to 0.95) for the simple model. The AUC statistics based on the external validation cohort were 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.98) for the full model and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.96) for the simple model. Good calibration accuracy of these two models was found in the derivation and validation cohort. CONCLUSION: The prediction models showed good model performance in identifying patients with COVID-19 with a high risk of death in 60 days. It may be useful for acute risk classification.

An association between anxiety and increased body weight has been documented. Identifying associations between diet quality and anxiety may facilitate the development of preventive dietary policy, particularly relevant since obesity appears to increase the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. In this study we aim to examine associations between changes in diet pattern and body weight and anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic among Israeli respondents to an international online survey. METHODS: Conducted between March 30-April 252,020, this was cross-sectional, international and online study. The questionnaire was developed and tested in Hebrew and translated into six other languages: English, Arabic, Spanish, French, Italian, and Russian. The survey was conducted on a Google Survey platform, the link to which was posted on several social media platforms. Adults aged 18 or older who saw and responded to the link on a social media site comprised the study population. RESULTS: Of the 3979 eligible respondents, 1895 indicated their current location as Israel. Most Israeli respondents completed the survey in Hebrew (83.2%) followed by Arabic (9.4%), though responses were recorded in all seven of the survey languages. The median age was 33 (IQ = 22) years, and 75.7% were female. Almost 60% indicated that their pre-pandemic diet was healthier than their current diet, and 25.2% indicated they had gained weight during the pandemic. The median Mediterranean diet score was 9 (IQ = 3). While the median General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score was 5 (IQ = 8), only 37.3% of participants reported at least mild anxiety (a GAD-7 score of 5 or more), while 10.7% reported moderate anxiety or greater (a GAD-7 score of 10 or more). In a multivariate logistic regression model of at least mild anxiety, being male and completing the survey in Hebrew significantly reduced odds of at least mild anxiety, while a worsening of diet quality during the pandemic, weight gain, and isolation significantly increased odds of at least mild anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID pandemic, changes in nutrition quality and habits were associated with greater anxiety. These findings suggest the need for routine and continuous surveillance of the nutritional and psychological consequences of outbreaks as part of healthcare preparedness efforts. Organizations responsible for community-based health services (such as Israeli health plans) should adopt specific interventions to improve case finding and support individuals at increased risk of anxiety and declining nutrition status within primary healthcare settings. These interventions should include the provision of appropriate diagnostic instruments, training of medical staff, feedback to physicians and nurses, and raising awareness among the relevant patient population and their caregivers. Primary care physicians should refer people with high anxiety or substantial weight gain during the pandemic to appropriate mental health and dietetic treatment, as needed.

One reason for this is the rapidly increasing number of new infections. On the other hand, the high sickness rates of doctors and nurses, particularly in ENT medicine, are aggravating the situation. Telemedicine can be a useful tool to reduce the number of physician-patient contacts. This could break infection chains and minimize the risk of infection for physicians. METHODS: To prepare the review, a selective literature search was conducted at www.pubmed.com using the relevant English technical terms for telemedicine and ENT. In addition, research was conducted at www.news.google.com on current developments of the COVID-19 pandemic with the search terms ""telemedicine"" and ""COVID-19."" RESULTS: Telemedicine can be helpful in direct contact with patients as well as in the conciliar support of general practitioners. The available studies show that, on average, more than 50% of medical consultations could be carried out telemedically. Both physicians and patients rate the use of telemedicine positively. Neither image quality nor the handling of the technology are relevant obstacles to a reliable diagnosis. Patients indicated that the telemedical consultation did not last longer than a traditional consultation. Patients also highlighted the faster and better availability of medical care through telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine can make a decisive contribution to coping with the current COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the establishment of telemedicine can help us to become better prepared for future pandemics.","Hagge, Daniel; Knopf, Andreas; Hofauer, Benedikt",HNO,183,24

In this report, we describe our experience in screening for SARS-CoV-2 prior to semiurgent and urgent hospital procedures. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: A single tertiary-care medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Our study cohort included patients &#8805;18 years of age who had semiurgent or urgent hospital procedures or surgeries. METHODS: Overall, 625 patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 using a combination of phone questionnaire (7 days prior to the anticipated procedure), RT-PCR and chest computed tomography (CT) between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 625 patients, 520 scans (83.2%) were interpreted as normal; 1 (0.16%) had typical features of COVID-19; 18 scans (2.88%) had indeterminate features of COVID-19; and 86 (13.76%) had atypical features of COVID-19. In total, 640 RT-PCRs were performed, with 1 positive result (0.15%) in a patient with a CT scan that yielded an atypical finding. Of the 18 patients with chest CTs categorized as indeterminate, 5 underwent repeat negative RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab 1 week after their initial swab. Also, 1 patient with a chest CT categorized as typical had a follow-up repeat negative RT-PCR, indicating that the chest CT was likely a false positive. After surgery, none of the patients developed signs or symptoms suspicious of COVID-19 that would indicate the need for a repeated RT-PCR or CT scan. CONCLUSION: In our experience, chest CT scanning did not prove provide valuable information in detecting asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in our low-prevalence population.","Shah, Aditya S; Walkoff, Lara A; Kuzo, Ronald S; Callstrom, Matthew R; Brown, Michael J; Kendrick, Michael L; Narr, Bradly J; Berbari, Elie",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,183,12

This survey was launched in February 2021 and ran for 11 days. Recipients of a first COVID-19 vaccine dose &#8805;7 days prior to survey completion were eligible. The incidence and severity of vaccination side effects were assessed. The survey was completed by 2002 respondents of whom 26.6% had a prior COVID-19 infection. A prior COVID-19 infection was associated with an increased risk of any side effect (risk ratio 1.08, 95% confidence intervals (1.05-1.11)), fever (2.24 (1.86-2.70)), breathlessness (2.05 (1.28-3.29)), flu-like illness (1.78 (1.51-2.10)), fatigue (1.34 (1.20-1.49)) and local reactions (1.10 (1.06-1.15)). It was also associated with an increased risk of severe side effects leading to hospital care (1.56 (1.14-2.12)). While mRNA vaccines were associated with a higher incidence of any side effect (1.06 (1.01-1.11)) compared with viral vector-based vaccines, these were generally milder (p < 0.001), mostly local reactions. Importantly, mRNA vaccine recipients reported a considerably lower incidence of systemic reactions (RR < 0.6) including anaphylaxis, swelling, flu-like illness, breathlessness and fatigue and of side effects requiring hospital care (0.42 (0.31-0.58)). Our study confirms the findings of recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrating that COVID-19 vaccines are generally safe with limited severe side effects. For the first time, our study links prior COVID-19 illness with an increased incidence of vaccination side effects and demonstrates that mRNA vaccines cause milder, less frequent systemic side effects but more local reactions.","Mathioudakis, Alexander G; Ghrew, Murad; Ustianowski, Andrew; Ahmad, Shazaad; Borrow, Ray; Papavasileiou, Lida Pieretta; Petrakis, Dimitrios; Bakerly, Nawar Diar",,183,15

The usefulness of existing approaches for re-purposing range from computational modeling to clinical trials. These are often time-consuming, resource intensive, and prone to failure. Proposed here is a new but simple concept that would capitalize on the opportunity presented by the on-going natural experiment involving the collection of data from epidemiological surveillance screening and diagnostic testing for clinical treatment. The objective would be to also collect for each Covid-19 case the patient's prior usage of existing therapeutic drugs. These drug usage data would be collected for several major test groups - those who test positive for active SARS-CoV-2 infection (using molecular methods) and those who test negative for current infection but also test positive for past infection (using serologic antibody tests). Patients from each of these groups would also be categorized with respect to where they resided on the spectrum of morbidities (from no or mild symptomology to severe). By comparing the distribution of normalized usage data for each drug within each group, drugs that are more associated with particular test groups could be revealed as having potential prophylactic, therapeutic, or contraindicated effects with respect to disease progression. These drugs could then be selected as candidates for further evaluation in fighting Covid-19. Also summarized are some of the numerous attributes, advantages, and limitations of the proposed concept, all pointing to the need for further discussion and evaluation.","Daughton, Christian G",Glob Epidemiol,183,22

(Special Issue: Covid-19.),16.412594,3.5726311,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing threat to public health. Since the identification of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, no drugs have been developed to specifically target SARS-CoV-2. To develop effective and safe treatment options, a better understanding of cellular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection is required. To fill this knowledge gap, researchers require reliable experimental systems that express the host proteins necessary for the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. These proteins include the viral receptor, ACE2 and the proteases TMPRSS2 and furin. A number of studies have reported cell-type specific expression of the genes encoding these molecules. However, less is known about the protein expression of these molecules. METHODS: We assessed the suitability of primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells maintained in air-liquid interface (ALI) as an experimental system for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. During cellular differentiation, we measured the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and furin over progressive ALI days by RT-qPCR, western blot and immunofluorescence staining. We also explored the effect of the fibrotic cytokine TGF-b on the expression of these proteins in well-differentiated HBE cells. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: Like ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin proteins are localized in differentiated ciliated cells as confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. These data suggest that well-differentiated HBE cells maintained in air-liquid interface is a reliable in vitro system for investigating cellular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We further identified that profibrotic mediators, TGF-ß1 and TGF-ß2, increase the expression of furin, which is a protease required for the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2.","O039,; Sullivan, Michael J; Mitchel, Jennifer A; Mwase, Chimwemwe; McGill, Maureen; Kanki, Phyllis; Park, Jin-Ah","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",183,24

Our simulation results find that all countries’ trade and exports will be significantly hurt by the pandemic. Due to the trade diversion effect and the price growth effect, some countries will see an increase in import trade. Comparatively, the pandemic has the most negative impact on global trade, followed by the EU, China, and the US. As the pandemic deepens, the negative impact on trade will increase.

On 27-28 January 2021, a group of 50+ scientists from numerous organizations around the world met in the 2nd CIAO AOP Design Workshop to discuss the depiction of the COVID-19 disease process as a series of key events (KEs) in a network of AOPs. During the workshop, 74 such KEs forming 13 AOPs were identified, covering COVID-19 manifestations that affect the respiratory, neurological, liver, cardiovascular, kidney and gastrointestinal systems. Modulating factors influencing the course and severity of the disease were also addressed, as was a possible extension of the investigations beyond purely biological phenomena. The workshop ended with the creation of seven working groups, which will further elaborate on the AOPs to be presented and discussed in the 3rd CIAO workshop on 28-29 April 2021.","Wittwehr, Clemens; Amorim, Maria João; Clerbaux, Laure-Alix; Krebs, Catharine; Landesmann, Brigitte; Macmillan, Donna S; Nymark, Penny; Ram, Rebecca; Garcia-Reyero, Natàlia; Sachana, Magdalini; Sullivan, Kristie; Sund, Jukka; Willett, Catharine",ALTEX,183,17

However, the effective constituents of QFPDD remain unclear. In this study, an UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS based method was developed to identify the chemical constituents in QFPDD and the absorbed prototypes as well as the metabolites in mice serum and tissues following oral administration of QFPDD. A total of 405 chemicals, including 40 kinds of alkaloids, 162 kinds of flavonoids, 44 kinds of organic acids, 71 kinds of triterpene saponins and 88 kinds of other compounds in the water extract of QFPDD were tentatively identified via comparison with the retention times and MS/MS spectra of the standards or refereed by literature. With the help of the standards and in vitro metabolites, 195 chemical components (including 104 prototypes and 91 metabolites) were identified in mice serum after oral administration of QFPDD.

To deal with these changes, it is necessary to develop a resilience capacity that allows for the establishment of different patterns of relationships through a new management model. The application of circularity principles implies a radical change in stakeholder relations, breaking with the ""end-of-life"" concept existing in linear economies. Furthermore, circular economy can ensure resilience in supply chains, and it can be considered as a tool in uncertain environments. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyse the association between the customer-supplier relationships with circular supply chains based on the intellectual capital-based view theory. External capital is a crucial factor for organisations, and it helps with building remarkable capabilities for the whole supply chain due to collaboration and cooperation. This research contributes with a systematic revision of the literature regarding circular supply chains and customer-supplier external capital, providing an exploratory model. Establishing a closer and effective relationship with customers and suppliers supposes a differentiating value and competitive advantages. Actors involved in the supply chain are essential in the implementation of circularity in organisations for reducing waste production and returning resources to the production cycle. Therefore, circular networks related to customers' behaviour, sustainable supplier election and IT tools play a key factor in improving resilience in supply chains.","Alonso-Munoz, S.; Gonzalez-Sanchez, R.; Siligardi, C.; Garcia-Muina, F.

It accesses host cells through the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, which is expressed by endothelial cells (EC) and very abundantly expressed in the lungs. SARS-CoV-2 uses a surface glycoprotein (peplomer) called a spike to access host cells and ACE2 has been revealed to be a co-receptor for coronavirus entry. The antigen presentation of SARS-CoV mainly depends on the MHC I molecule, but MHC II also contributes to the presentation. Based on the mechanism of a common acute viral infection, the antibody profile against the SARS-CoV virus contains characteristic pattern of IgM and IgG production. By the end of week 12, SARS-specific IgM antibodies disappear, whereas IgG antibodies can last in a longer period of time, which shows IgG antibodies can mainly hold a protective role, and SARS-specific IgG antibodies mainly are S-specific and N-specific antibodies. Clinical manifestations are not only found in mucosa in the airways but also in the cardiovascular system, kidneys, central nervous system, pregnancy, skin, oral cavity and digestive system. The diagnose of clinical presentation of COVID-19 is mainly based on a history of epidemiology, clinical manifestations of pneumonia symptoms (for example, fever, dry cough, myalgia, and shortness of breath) and several additional examinations, include detection of nucleic acids, CT scanning, immune identification technology (POCT) ) IgM / IgG, related to enzymes, immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and blood culture.","Huldani,; Uinarni, Herlina; Sukmana, Bayu Indra; Tommy, Thomas; Said, Muhammad Fadli; Edyson,; Eso, Amiruddin; Sitepu, RyantoKarobuana; Arifin, EviMustikawati; Mawu, Ferra Olivia; Polim, Arie Adrianus; Effendi, IwanKurnia; Ariestiyanto, Yustinus Charles; Martamba, Hutasoit Charles; Ahdiya, Wafa; Ridhoni, Muhammad Hasan; Achmad, Harun",Syst.

In search of a tool to spread dermatologic knowledge during confinement, an online medical meeting was held on April 25th to 26th, 2020. In this study, we aimed to assess the characteristics, opinion and satisfaction of the attendees to a free-of-charge online congress. Secondarily, we intended to explain how this meeting was prepared. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Online survey administered to the attendees to an online congress organised via the Telegram® Messenger App. Its organisation and planning, which needed no financial support and was done by volunteer organisers, moderators and speakers, is described step by step. RESULTS: The satisfaction of both speakers and attendees was very high. All participants considered that this format had a great present and future, and most of them rated it as superior to regular face-to-face meetings. Female gender and predominantly private practice favoured this opinion. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the cancellation of most scientific gatherings. This has been seen by some authors as an excellent opportunity, encouraging medical societies and organisations to lead the change to virtual meetings. Although confinement did not allow real contact, our online meeting showed it was possible to ensure interaction and participation between attendees, moderators and speakers. Dermatologists enjoyed some dermatologic science, even despite the extraordinary circumstances disrupting their daily clinical practice. Most of them felt they were participating in something new and compelling that many felt superior to traditional meetings.","Martin-Gorgojo, A; Bernabeu-Wittel, J; Linares-Barrios, M; Russo-de la Torre, F; García-Doval, I; Del Río-de la Torre, E",Actas Dermosifiliogr,183,15

AIM: To describe COVID-19 containment in a nursing home transformed into a caring center. METHODS: Physicians and nurses were recruited. The facility was reorganized and connected with the laboratory of the reference hospital. Ultrasound was used to diagnose pneumonia. Patients needing intensive care were transferred to the reference hospital. Hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin/enoxaparin were used initially, while amiodarone/enoxaparin were used at a later phase. Under both regimens, methylprednisolone was added for severe cases. Prophylaxis was done with hydroxychloroquine initially and then with amiodarone. PERIOD COVERED: March 22-July 31, 2020. RESULTS: The facility was reorganized in two days. Ninety-two guests of the 121 (76%) and 25 personnel of 118 (21.1%) became swab test positive. Seven swab test negative patients who developed symptoms were considered to have COVID-19. Twenty-seven patients died, 23 swab test positive, 5 of whom after full recovery. Four patients needing intensive care were transferred (3 died). Mortality, peaking in April 2020, was correlated with symptoms, comorbidities, dyspnea, fatigue, stupor/coma, high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, pro-calcitonin, and high oxygen need (p &#8804; 0.001 for all). Among swab-positive staff, 3 had pneumonia and recovered. Although no comparison could be made between different treatment and prophylaxis strategies, potentially useful suggestions emerged. Mortality compared well with that of nursing homes of the same area not transformed into care centers.

A., Craske, M. G., & Graybiel, A. M. (2014). Psychological treatments: A call for mental-health science. Nature, 511(7509), 287-289. doi:10.1038/511287a). While early days, we here illustrate a line of research explored by our group-intrusive imagery-based memories after trauma. METHOD/RESULTS: We illustrate three possible approaches through which mental health science may stimulate thinking around psychological treatment innovation. First, focusing on single/specific target symptoms rather than full, multifaceted psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., intrusive trauma memories rather than all of posttraumatic stress disorder). Second, investigating mechanisms that can be modified in treatment (treatment mechanisms), rather than those which cannot (e.g., processes only linked to aetiology). Finally, exploring novel ways of delivering psychological treatment (peer-/self-administration), given the prevalence of mental health problems globally, and the corresponding need for effective interventions that can be delivered at scale and remotely for example at times of crisis (e.g., current COVID-19 pandemic). CONCLUSIONS: These three approaches suggest options for potential innovative avenues through which mental health science may be harnessed to recouple basic and applied research and transform treatment development.","Singh, Laura; Espinosa, Lisa; Ji, Julie L; Moulds, Michelle L; Holmes, Emily A",Cogn Neuropsychiatry,183,21

However, the expression and purification of membrane protein structure is difficult despite tremendous progress. In this study, the 3 D structure is modeled followed by intensive validation and molecular dynamics simulation. The lack of suitable homologous templates (>30% sequence identities) leads us to construct the membrane protein models using template-free modeling (de novo or ab initio) approach with Robetta and trRosetta servers. Comparing with other model structures, it is evident that trRosetta (TM-score: 0.64; TM region RMSD: 2 Å) can provide the best model than Robetta (TM-score: 0.61; TM region RMSD: 3.3 Å) and I-TASSER (TM-score: 0.45; TM region RMSD: 6.5 Å). 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations are performed on the model structures by incorporating membrane environment. Moreover, secondary structure elements and principal component analysis (PCA) have also been performed on MD simulation data. Finally, trRosetta model is utilized for interpretation and visualization of interacting residues during protein-protein interactions. The common interacting residues including Phe103, Arg107, Met109, Trp110, Arg131, and Glu135 in the C-terminal domain of M protein are identified in membrane-spike and membrane-nucleocapsid protein complexes. The active site residues are also predicted for potential drug and peptide binding.

This infection disease, named COVID-19, is characterized by a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic or mild upper respiratory tract illness to severe viral pneumonia with fulminant cytokine storm, which leads to respiratory failure. To improve patient outcomes, both the inhibition of viral replication and of the unwarranted excessive inflammatory response are crucial. Since no specific antiviral drug has been proven effective for the treatment of patients and the only upcoming promising agents are monoclonal antibodies, inexpensive, safe, and widely available treatments are urgently needed. A potential anti-inflammatory molecule to be evaluated, which possesses antiviral activities in several experimental models, is the polyphenol resveratrol. This compound has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in human primary bronchial epithelial cell cultures and to downregulate several pathogenetic mechanisms involved in COVID-19 severity. The use of resveratrol in clinical practice is limited by the low bioavailability following oral administration, due to the pharmacokinetic and metabolic characteristics of the molecule. Therefore, topical administration through inhaled formulations could allow us to achieve sufficiently high concentrations of the compound in the airways, the entry route of SARS-CoV-2.","Rossi, Giovanni A; Sacco, Oliviero; Capizzi, Antonino; Mastromarino, Paola",Front Immunol,183,24

While a previous study demonstrated that health and eHealth literacy are related to COVID-19 prevention behaviors, few studies have focused on the relationship between health literacy, eHealth literacy, and COVID-19-related health behaviors. The latter includes not only preventative behaviors but also conventional health behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop and verify a COVID-19-related health behavior questionnaire, explore its status and structure, and examine the associations between these behaviors and participants' health literacy and eHealth literacy. METHODS: A snowball sampling method was adopted to recruit participants to complete anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire surveys online that assessed sociodemographic information, self-reported coronavirus knowledge, health literacy, eHealth literacy, and COVID-19-related health behaviors. RESULTS: Of 1873 college students who were recruited, 781 (41.7%) had adequate health literacy; the mean eHealth literacy score was 30.16 (SD 6.31). The COVID-19-related health behavior questionnaire presented a two-factor structure-COVID-19-specific precautionary behaviors and conventional health behaviors-with satisfactory fit indices and internal consistency (Cronbach &#945;=.79). The mean score of COVID-19-related health behaviors was 53.77 (SD 8.03), and scores differed significantly (P<.05) with respect to residence, college year, academic major, family economic level, self-reported health status, having a family member or friend infected with coronavirus, and health literacy level. Linear regression analysis showed that health literacy and eHealth literacy were positively associated with COVID-19-specific precautionary behaviors (ßhealth literacy=.149, ßeHealth literacy=.368; P<.001) and conventional health behaviors (ßhealth literacy=.219, ßeHealth literacy=.277; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19-related health behavior questionnaire was a valid and reliable measure for assessing health behaviors during the pandemic. College students with higher health literacy and eHealth literacy can more actively adopt COVID-19-related health behaviors. Additionally, compared to health literacy, eHealth literacy is more closely related to COVID-19-related health behaviors. Public intervention measures based on health and eHealth literacy are required to promote COVID-19-related health behaviors during the pandemic, which may be helpful to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection among college students.","Li, Shaojie; Cui, Guanghui; Kaminga, Atipatsa Chiwanda; Cheng, Sixiang; Xu, Huilan",J Med Internet Res,183,16

Moreover, there still exists a shortfall in demonstrating specific clinical manifestations of the brain involvement of the virus. Here, we presented a 33-year-old female patient with COVID-19, reporting acute-onset paranoid delusions symptoms, insomnia and irritability. Cranial MRI showed an hyperintense signal in the splenium of the corpus callosum with decreased apparent diffusion coefficient, which might possibly indicate the presence of cytotoxic edema related to the brain involvement of the infection. Following the completion of SARS-CoV-2 treatment, both cytotoxic edema and psychiatric symptoms resolved. In light of this report, we suggest that either heightened immune response and direct viral infection that SARS-CoV-2 may lead to such psychiatric manifestations and neuropsychiatric monitoring should be performed in patients with COVID-19.

Transmission of virus takes place either directly through close contact with infected individual (symptomatic/asymptomatic) or indirectly by touching contaminated surfaces. Virus survives on the surfaces from few hours to days. It enters the human body through nose, eyes or mouth. Other sources of contamination are faeces, blood, food, water, semen etc. Parameters such as temperature/relative humidity also play an important role in transmission. As the disease is evolving, so are the number of cases. Proper planning and restriction are helping in influencing the trajectory of the transmission. Various measures are undertaken to prevent infection such as maintaining hygiene, using facemasks, isolation/quarantine, social/physical distancing, in extreme cases lockdown (restricted movement except essential services) in hot spot areas or throughout the country. Countries that introduced various mitigation measures had experienced control in transmission of COVID-19. Python programming is conducted for change point analysis (CPA) using Bayesian probability approach for understanding the impact of restrictions and mitigation methods in terms of either increase or stagnation in number of COVID-19 cases for eight countries. From analysis it is concluded that countries which acted late in bringing in the social distancing measures are suffering in terms of high number of cases with USA, leading among eight countries analysed. The CPA week in comparison with date of lockdown and first reported case strongly correlates (Pearson's r = - 0.86 to - 0.97) to cases, cases per unit area and cases per unit population, indicating earlier the mitigation strategy, lesser the number of cases. The overall paper will help the decision makers in understanding the possible steps for mitigation, more so in developing countries where the fight against COVID-19 seems to have just begun.","Kaur, Satinder; Bherwani, Hemant; Gulia, Sunil; Vijay, Ritesh; Kumar, Rakesh",Environ Dev Sustain,183,1

We investigated differences in LOS, discharge disposition, and charges between hospitalizations for serious infections in patients with and without OUD. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We utilized the 2016 National Inpatient Sample-a nationally representative database of all discharges from US acute care hospitals. The population of interest was all hospitalizations for infective endocarditis, epidural abscess, septic arthritis, or osteomyelitis. The exposure was OUD, and the primary outcome was LOS until discharge, assessed by using a competing risks analysis to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs). Adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of discharge disposition and adjusted differences in hospital charges were also reported. Of 95,470 estimated hospitalizations for serious infections (infective endocarditis, epidural abscess, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis), the mean age was 49 years and 35% were female. 46% had Medicare (government-based insurance coverage for people age 65+ years), and 70% were non-Hispanic white. After adjustment for potential confounders, OUD was associated with a lower probability of discharge at any given LOS (aHR 0.61; 95% CI 0.59-0.63; p < 0.001). OUD was also associated with lower odds of discharge to home (aOR 0.38; 95% CI 0.33-0.43; p < 0.001) and higher odds of discharge to a post-acute care facility (aOR 1.85; 95% CI 1.57-2.17; p < 0.001) or patient-directed discharge (also referred to as ""discharge against medical advice"") (aOR 3.47; 95% CI 2.80-4.29; p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in average total hospital charges, though daily hospital charges were significantly lower for patients with OUD. Limitations include the potential for unmeasured confounders and the use of billing codes to identify cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that among hospitalizations for some serious infections, those involving patients with OUD were associated with longer LOS, higher odds of discharge to post-acute care facilities or patient-directed discharge, and similar total hospital charges, despite lower daily charges. These findings highlight opportunities to improve care for patients with OUD hospitalized with serious infections, and to reduce the growing associated costs.","Kim, June-Ho; Fine, Danielle R; Li, Lily; Kimmel, Simeon D; Ngo, Long H; Suzuki, Joji; Price, Christin N; Ronan, Matthew V; Herzig, Shoshana J",PLoS Med,183,21

Here, abundant natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages help the uterine vasculature adapt to fetal demands for gas and nutrients, thereby supporting fetal growth. Fetal trophoblast cells budding off the forming placenta and invading deep into maternal tissues come into contact with these and other immune cells. Besides their homeostatic functions, decidual NK cells can respond to pathogens during infection, but in doing so, they may become conflicted between destroying the invader and sustaining fetoplacental growth. We review how maternal NK cells balance their double duty both in the local microenvironment of the uterus and systemically, during toxoplasmosis, influenza, cytomegalovirus, malaria and other infections that threat pregnancy. We also discuss recent developments in the understanding of NK-cell responses to SARS-Cov-2 infection and the possible dangers of COVID-19 during pregnancy.","Shmeleva, Evgeniya V; Colucci, Francesco",Mucosal immunology (Online),183,10

STUDY DESIGN: 22 healthy children were randomly assigned to two groups, both groups wearing an N95 mask: one without an exhalation valve, another with an exhalation valve. We tracked changes in partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2), oxygen saturation, pulse rate and respiratory rate over 72-minutes of mask-use. All subjects were monitored every 15 minutes, the first 30 minutes while not wearing a mask, and the next 30 minutes while wearing a mask. Children then performed a 12-minute walking test. RESULTS: Children did not experience a statistically significant change in oxygen saturation or pulse rate during the study. There was a significant increase in respiratory rate and PETCO2 in those children wearing a mask without an exhalation valve, whereas this was only seen in those children wearing a mask with an exhalation valve after the walking test. CONCLUSION: The use of an N95 mask could potentially cause breathing difficulties in children if the mask does not have an exhalation valve, particularly during a physical activity. We believe that it may be more appropriate for children to use a surgical mask.","Lubrano, Riccardo; Bloise, Silvia; Marcellino, Alessia; Ciolli, Claudia Proietti; Testa, Alessia; De Luca, Enrica; Dilillo, Anna; Mallardo, Saverio; Isoldi, Sara; Martucci, Vanessa; Sanseviero, MariaTeresa; Del Giudice, Emanuela; Malvaso, Concetta; Iacovelli, Claudio; Leone, Rita; Iorfida, Donatella; Ventriglia, Flavia",J. pediatr.

In this research, an automated system is created to differentiate between the COVID-19, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics by using their genomic sequences recorded in the NCBI GenBank in order to facilitate the diagnosis process and increase the accuracy of disease detection in less time. The selected database contains 76 genes for each epidemic. Then, some features are extracted like a discrete Fourier transform (DFT), discrete cosine transform (DCT) and the seven moment invariants to two different classifiers. These classifiers are the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and the trainable cascade-forward back propagation neural network where they give satisfying results to compare. To evaluate the performance of classifiers, there are some effective parameters calculated. They are accuracy (ACC), F1 score, error rate and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) that are 100%, 100%, 0 and 1, respectively, for the KNN algorithm and 98.89%, 98.34%, 0.0111 and 0.9754, respectively, for the cascade-forward network.","Naeem, Safaa M; Mabrouk, Mai S; Marzouk, Samir Y; Eldosoky, Mohamed A",Brief. bioinform,183,16

Coronavirus is disturbing human life in an exceptional method and has converted a public health global crisis. Natural products are ahead consideration due to the huge beneficial window and effective anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant and antiviral possessions. Consequently, the present study was intended to display inhibition ability of natural products coumarins and their analogues against SARS coronavirus. METHODS: The present study, aims to forecast theoretical assembly for the protease of COVID-19 and to discover advance whether this protein may assist as a target for protease inhibitors such as psoralen, bergapten, imperatorin, heraclenin, heraclenol, saxalin, oxepeucedanin, angelicin, toddacoumaquinone, and aesculetin. The docking score of these natural coumarin analogues compared with standard Hydroxychloroquine. Whereas the 3D assembly of main protease of SARS coronavirus was forecast with SWISS MODEL web server, and molecular interaction studies amongst target protein and ligands were done with AutoDock Vina software. RESULTS: The study more exposed that all the inhibitors acquired with negative dock energy against the target protein. Molecular docking investigation displayed that natural coumarin analogue toddacoumaquinone displayed a remarkable inhibition ability with the binding energy of -7.8 kcal/mol than other compounds against main protease of SARS coronavirus in intricate with &#945;-ketoamide (PDB ID: 5N5O). The synthetic coumarin analogue (1 m) also displayed the comparable inhibition ability with a binding energy of -7.1 kcal/mol against main protease of SARS coronavirus in intricate with &#945;-ketoamide. Keeping the overhead results of ADME and toxicity, all tested compounds were recognized as drug-like nature, passing Lipinski's ""Rule of 5"" with 0 violation except &#945;-ketoamide passes Lipinski's ""Rule of 5"" with 1 violation MW > 500. The projected constraints are within the assortment of recognized values. CONCLUSIONS: Based upon the results of the manifold sequence alliance, natural and synthetic coumarin binding sites were preserved. The present in silico examination thus, delivers structural awareness about the protease of COVID-19 and molecular relations with some of the recognised protease inhibitors.","Chidambaram, Sathish Kumar; Ali, Daoud; Alarifi, Saud; Radhakrishnan, Surendrakumar; Akbar, Idhayadhulla",J Infect Public Health,183,16

The ideal building material should be (1) versatile and controllable in shape and stoichiometry, (2) spontaneously self-assemble, and (3) thermodynamically, chemically, and enzymatically stable with a long shelf life. RNA building blocks exhibit each of the above. RNA is a polynucleic acid, making it a polymer, and its negative-charge prevents nonspecific binding to negatively charged cell membranes. The thermostability makes it suitable for logic gates, resistive memory, sensor set-ups, and NEM devices. RNA can be designed and manipulated with a level of simplicity of DNA while displaying versatile structure and enzyme activity of proteins. RNA can fold into single-stranded loops or bulges to serve as mounting dovetails for intermolecular or domain interactions without external linking dowels. RNA nanoparticles display rubber- and amoeba-like properties and are stretchable and shrinkable through multiple repeats, leading to enhanced tumor targeting and fast renal excretion to reduce toxicities. It was predicted in 2014 that RNA would be the third milestone in pharmaceutical drug development. The recent approval of several RNA drugs and COVID-19 mRNA vaccines by FDA suggests that this milestone is being realized.

In the early phase of the pandemic in Italy, the decentralized healthcare system allowed regions to adopt different testing strategies. The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of the extensive testing of symptomatic individuals and their contacts on the number of hospitalizations against a more stringent testing strategy limited to suspected cases with severe respiratory illness and an epidemiological link to a COVID-19 case. A Poisson regression modelling approach was adopted. In the first model developed, the cumulative daily number of positive cases and a temporal trend were considered as explanatory variables. In the second, the cumulative daily number of swabs was further added. The explanatory variable, given by the number of swabs over time, explained most of the observed differences in the number of hospitalizations between the two strategies. The percentage of the expected error dropped from 70% of the first, simpler model to 15%. Increasing testing to detect and isolate infected individuals in the early phase of an outbreak improves the capability to reduce the spread of serious infections, lessening the burden of hospitals.","Berchialla, Paola Giraudo Maria Teresa Fava Carmen Ricotti Andrea Saglio Giuseppe Lorenzoni Giulia Sciannameo Veronica Urru Sara Prosepe Ilaria Lanera Corrado Azzolina Danila Gregori Dario",Applied Sciences,183,10

This paper investigates the impact of this disruption on the progress towards the WHO 2030 target for STH. METHODS: We used two stochastic individual-based models to simulate the impact of missing one or more preventive chemotherapy (PC) rounds in different endemicity settings. We also investigated the extent to which this impact can be lessened by mitigation strategies, such as semiannual or community-wide PC. RESULTS: Both models show that without a mitigation strategy, control programmes will catch up by 2030, assuming that coverage is maintained. The catch-up time can be up to 4.5 y after the start of the interruption. Mitigation strategies may reduce this time by up to 2 y and increase the probability of achieving the 2030 target. CONCLUSIONS: Although a PC interruption will only temporarily impact the progress towards the WHO 2030 target, programmes are encouraged to restart as soon as possible to minimise the impact on morbidity. The implementation of suitable mitigation strategies can turn the interruption into an opportunity to accelerate progress towards reaching the target.","Malizia, Veronica; Giardina, Federica; Vegvari, Carolin; Bajaj, Sumali; McRae-McKee, Kevin; Anderson, Roy M; de Vlas, Sake J; Coffeng, Luc E",Trans.

We focus on three major effects: changing patterns of generation and consumption, frequency stability, and the joint impact of low consumption and high share of renewable energy sources. Specifically, we analyze changes in consumption in the Israeli, Estonian, and Finnish grids, and attempt to identify patterns of consumption changes that may be explained by the pandemic. We also analyze changes in voltage and frequency, and show that the low consumption caused significant deviations from the nominal values of both parameters. One main conclusion is that the reduced energy consumption during the pandemic is critical, and has a major effect on the operation of small electric grids. Another conclusion is that since the pandemic pushed the relative share of renewable energy to record highs, this event may help us to better understand the influence of a high share of renewables on small grids, thus offering a glance into a renewable-rich future.","Carmon, David; Navon, Aviad; MacHlev, Ram; Belikov, Juri; Levron, Yoash",IEEE Access,183,20

Soft, skin-mounted electronics that incorporate high-bandwidth, miniaturized motion sensors enable digital, wireless measurements of mechanoacoustic (MA) signatures of both core vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature) and underexplored biomarkers (coughing count) with high fidelity and immunity to ambient noises. This paper summarizes an effort that integrates such MA sensors with a cloud data infrastructure and a set of analytics approaches based on digital filtering and convolutional neural networks for monitoring of COVID-19 infections in sick and healthy individuals in the hospital and the home. Unique features are in quantitative measurements of coughing and other vocal events, as indicators of both disease and infectiousness. Systematic imaging studies demonstrate correlations between the time and intensity of coughing, speaking, and laughing and the total droplet production, as an approximate indicator of the probability for disease spread. The sensors, deployed on COVID-19 patients along with healthy controls in both inpatient and home settings, record coughing frequency and intensity continuously, along with a collection of other biometrics. The results indicate a decaying trend of coughing frequency and intensity through the course of disease recovery, but with wide variations across patient populations. The methodology creates opportunities to study patterns in biometrics across individuals and among different demographic groups.","Ni, Xiaoyue; Ouyang, Wei; Jeong, Hyoyoung; Kim, Jin-Tae; Tzaveils, Andreas; Mirzazadeh, Ali; Wu, Changsheng; Lee, Jong Yoon; Keller, Matthew; Mummidisetty, Chaithanya K; Patel, Manish; Shawen, Nicholas; Huang, Joy; Chen, Hope; Ravi, Sowmya; Chang, Jan-Kai; Lee, KunHyuck; Wu, Yixin; Lie, Ferrona; Kang, Youn J; Kim, Jong Uk; Chamorro, Leonardo P; Banks, Anthony R; Bharat, Ankit; Jayaraman, Arun; Xu, Shuai; Rogers, John A",Proc.

Standard measures of the situation provided by the governments include reported positive cases and total deaths. While total deaths indicate immediately that countries like Italy and Spain had the worst situation as of mid-April, 2020, reported cases alone do not provide a complete picture of the situation. Different countries diagnose differently and present very distinctive reported case fatality ratios. Similar levels of reported incidence and mortality might hide a very different underlying pictures. Here we present a straightforward and robust estimation of the diagnostic rate in each European country. From that estimation we obtain a uniform, unbiased incidence of the epidemic. The method to obtain the diagnostic rate is transparent and empirical. The key assumption of the method is that the infection fatality ratio of COVID-19 in Europe is not strongly country-dependent. We show that this number is not expected to be biased due to demography nor to the way total deaths are reported. The estimation protocol is dynamic, and it has been yielding converging numbers for diagnostic rates in all European countries as from mid-April, 2020. Using this diagnostic rate, policy makers can obtain Effective Potential Growth updated every day, providing an unbiased assessment of the countries at greater risk of experiencing an uncontrolled situation.

Even though we are witnessing the decline of the clinical autopsy, its importance remains unchanged as it is the most exhaustive way to investigate diseases. The identification of the virus in postmortem tissues is a fundamental step in the definition of its clinical features. OBJECTIVE.­: To investigate the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in postmortem examination with swabs. DESIGN.­: We performed postmortem swabs in 12 autopsy cases of patients with a clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia. Our protocol consisted of a rhinopharyngeal and a tracheal swab in order to search for the virus in the upper airways, and of 2 swabs on the parenchyma of each lung. We also performed a fifth swab on the parenchyma of both lungs in order to search for other viruses that could evolve in a clinical picture of interstitial pneumonia. RESULTS.­: Overall, we found 9 of 12 cases had at least 1 postmortem swab positive for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we evaluated the time between the antemortem and postmortem swabs, the time between death and the postmortem swabs, and the time between the postmortem swabs and acceptance to the microbiology laboratory. Of note, we did not find a relationship between the results of the swabs and either the time elapsed from their collection or the time elapsed before their acceptance in the microbiology laboratory. CONCLUSIONS.­: A thorough knowledge of the eventual persistence of pathogens in deaths related to infectious diseases is fundamental for the safety of the operators during the autopsy practice, especially when referring to emergent pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2. Our study highlights the importance in performing multiple swabs in the postmortem examination, because SARS-CoV-2 swab positivity can be limited to only a single swab.","Dell039,; Aquila, Marco; Cattani, Paola; Fantoni, Massimo; Marchetti, Simona; Aquila, Isabella; Stigliano, Egidio; Carbone, Arnaldo; Oliva, Antonio; Arena, Vincenzo",Arch Pathol Lab Med,183,16

Tunability of the framework aperture, cavity microenvironment, and scaffold topology significantly affects emission profiles, quantum yields, or fluorescence lifetimes of confined chromophores. In addition to the role of the host and its effect on the guest, the methods for integration of a chromophore (e.g., as a framework backbone, capping linker, ligand side group, or guest) are discussed. The overall potential of chromophore-integrated frameworks for a wide-range of applications, including artificial biomimetic systems, white-light emitting diodes, photoresponsive devices, and fluorescent sensors with unparalleled spatial resolution are highlighted throughout the review.","Leith, Gabrielle A; Martin, Corey R; Mayers, Jacob M; Kittikhunnatham, Preecha; Larsen, Randy W; Shustova, Natalia B",,183,20

Other models of care developed during the pandemic around the world were reviewed including their capacity, total bed/ICU bed ratio and time of use. We particularly analyzed the common and differential characteristics of this type of facilities. IFEMA Exhibition Center was transformed into a temporary 1,300-bed hospital, which was in continuous operation for 42 days. A total of 3,817 people were treated, generally patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, 91% of whom had pneumonia. The average length of stay was 5 to 36 days. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (16.5%), diabetes mellitus (9.1%), COPD (6%), asthma (4.6%), obesity (2.9%) and dementia (1.6%). A total of 113 patients (3%) were transferred to another centers for aggravation, 19 (0.5%) were admitted to ICU and 16 patients (0.4%) died. An element of great help to reducing the overload of care in large hospitals during peaks of health emergencies could be these flexible structures capable of absorbing the excess of patients. These must be safe, breaking domestic transmission and guarantee social and emotional needs of patients.

METHODS: In a prospective fashion, N95 respirators (n = 15) were randomized to a decontamination process (time, dry heat, or ultraviolet C light [UVC]) in outpatient clinics. Each respirator was re-used up to 5 separate clinic sessions. Swabs on each respirator for SARS-CoV-2, bacteria, and fungi were obtained before clinic, after clinic and post-treatment. Mask integrity was checked after each treatment (n = 68). Statistical analyses were performed to determine factors for positive samples. RESULTS: All three decontamination processes reduced bacteria counts similarly. On multivariate mixed model analysis, there were an additional 8.1 colonies of bacteria (95% CI 5.7 to 10.5; p < 0.01) on the inside compared to the outside surface of the respirators. Treatment resulted in a decrease of bacterial load by 8.6 colonies (95% CI -11.6 to -5.5; p < 0.01). Although no decontamination treatment affected the respirator filtration efficiency, heat treatments were associated with the breakdown of thermoplastic elastomer straps. Contamination with fungal and SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were minimal to non-existent. CONCLUSIONS: Time, heat and UVC all reduced bacterial load on reused N95 respirators. Fungal contamination was minimal. Heat could permanently damage some elastic straps making the respirators nonfunctional. Given its effectiveness against microbes, lack of damage to re-treated respirators and logistical ease, UVC represents an optimal decontamination method for individual N95 respirators when reuse is necessary.","Jiang, Zi Yang; Huang, Zhen; Schmale, Isaac; Brown, Eric L; Lorenz, Michael C; Patlovich, Scott J; Goswami, Karan; Wilson, Hannah B; Ahmad, Jumah; Alexander, Ronda; Bryan, William; Burke, Luke; Citardi, Martin J; Elias, Jose; Ho, Tang; Jacob, Jack; Low, Garren; Miramón, Pedro; Patki, Aniruddha U; Yao, William C; Luong, Amber U",Am J Otolaryngol,183,1

METHODS: Confirmed COVID-19 inpatients undergoing to unenhanced chest CT were scanned with a dual-energy acquisition (DECT, 90/150Sn kV) and a dual-source, high-pitch acquisition with tin-filtered 100 kVp (LDCT). On the DECT with ADMIRE 3 (DECT3) were evaluated the pulmonary findings and their extension (25-point score). Two radiologists in consensus evaluated with 5-point scales the overall image quality, the anatomical structures, and the elementary findings on LDCT reconstructed with filtered backprojection (LDCT0), with ADMIRE 3 (LDCT3) and 5 (LDCT5), and on DECT3. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the body mass index, the exposure times, and the radiation doses were recorded. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients (57 M/18F; median age: 63 y.o.) were included, with median pulmonary extension of 13/25 points. The imaging findings were detected in proportion comparable to the available literature. The ADMIRE significantly improved the SNR in LDCT (p < 0.00001) with almost no significant differences in overweight patients. The LDCT had median effective dose of 0.39 mSv and acquisition time of 0.71 s with significantly less motion artifacts than DECT (p < 0.00001). The DECT3 and LDCT3 provided the best image quality and depiction of pulmonary anatomy and imaging findings, with significant differences among all the series (p < 0.00001). CONCLUSION: The LDCT with spectral shaping and ADMIRE3 provided acceptable image quality in the evaluation of patients with COVID-19, with significantly reduced radiation dose and motion artifacts.","Agostini, Andrea; Borgheresi, Alessandra; Carotti, Marina; Ottaviani, Letizia; Badaloni, Myriam; Floridi, Chiara; Giovagnoni, Andrea",,183,24

To test this hypothesis, we conducted a large-scale online experiment (N = 1,102), using a sample from four countries (UK, US, Germany, Sweden). As predicted, people perceived themselves to adhere to the COVID-19 guidelines more strictly than both the average citizen of their country and their close friends.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: During custody in France, a medical consultation is provided for any patient who requests it. In the Paris area, this consultation is carried out by a practitioner in forensic medicine, based in a general hospital. Usually, most medical consultations for patients in custody take place directly in police stations. With the COVID-19 outbreak, the authors chose to suspend this activity, asking law enforcement to bring patients directly to their hospitals. Patients presenting with severe infections or indicative symptoms of the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 infection and a comorbidity are tested for COVID-19. Such patients remain hospitalized until results of the test are received. If the result is positive, they are hospitalized for the length of their custody. If sent to prison, they are transferred to a medical facility in detention. FINDINGS: From the onset of the outbreak, the authors observed increased pressure from law enforcement to obtain medical information. According to the French Code of Medical Ethics, no medical information should be disclosed regarding the authors' patients' medical situations. The authors are also concerned about sending a potentially infected patient back to a police station, to prison or to his/her home. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This paper provides a snapshot of issues relating to the management of patients in custody during the COVID-19 outbreak in France.

RESULTS: Abnormal LFT at baseline was present in 58% of patients, with a predominant elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (42%), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) (37%) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (27%), hypoalbuminaemia was observed in 33%. Elevation of ALT and GGT, as well as hypoalbuminaemia, was associated with higher proportions of patients requiring ICU treatment and mechanical ventilation. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, hypoalbuminaemia combined with abnormal AST or GGT at hospital admission was a highly significant independent risk factor for ICU admission (OR 46.22 and 38.8, respectively) and for a composite endpoint of ICU admission and/or COVID-19-related death (OR 42.0 and 26.9, respectively). CONCLUSION: Abnormal LFTs at hospital admission, in particular GGT and albumin, are associated with a severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Weber, Sabine; Hellmuth, Johannes C; Scherer, Clemens; Muenchhoff, Maximilian; Mayerle, Julia; Gerbes, Alexander L",Gut,183,29

About 30% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. Among them, approximately 25% require hospitalization. In medicine, cases are identified as those who become ill. During this pandemic, cases have been identified as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, including approximately 70% who were asymptomatic-this has caused unnecessary anxiety. Individuals more than 65 years old, those affected by obesity, diabetes, asthma, or are immune-depressed owing to cancer and other conditions, are at a higher risk of hospitalization and of dying of COVID-19. Healthy individuals younger than 40 years very rarely die of COVID-19. Estimates of the COVID-19 mortality rate vary because the definition of COVID-19-related deaths varies. Belgium has the highest death rate at 154.9 per 100,000 persons, because it includes anyone who died with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, even those never tested for SARS-CoV-2. The United States includes all patients who died with a positive test, whether they died because of, or with, SARS-CoV-2. Countries that include only patients in which COVID-19 was the main cause of death, rather than a cofactor, have lower death rates. Numerous therapies are being developed, and rapid improvements are anticipated. Because of disinformation, only approximately 50% of the U.S. population plans to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. By sharing accurate information, physicians, health professionals, and scientists play a key role in addressing myths and anxiety, help public health officials enact measures to decrease infections, and provide the best care for those who become sick. In this article, we discuss these issues.","Carbone, Michele; Lednicky, John; Xiao, Shu-Yuan; Venditti, Mario; Bucci, Enrico",J Thorac Oncol,183,23

We aimed to assess the timeliness of contact tracing among airline passengers arriving in Vietnam on flights containing COVID-19 cases and investigated factors associated with timeliness of contact tracing. METHODS: We included data from 2228 passengers on 22 incoming flights between 2 and 19 March 2020. Contact tracing duration was assessed separately for the time between the date of index case confirmation and date of contact tracing initiation (interval I), and the date of contact tracing initiation and completion (interval II). We used log-rank tests and multivariable Poisson regression models to identify factors associated with timeliness. RESULTS: The median duration of interval I and interval II was one (IQR: 1-2) and 3 days (IQR: 2-5), respectively. The contact tracing duration was shorter for passengers from flights where the index case was identified through mandatory testing directly upon arrival (median = 4; IQR: 3-5) compared to flights with index case detection through self-presentation at health facilities after arrival (median = 7; IQR: 5-8) (p-value = 0.018). Cumulative hazards for successful tracing were higher for Vietnamese nationals compared to non-Vietnamese nationals (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Contact tracing among flight passengers in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in Vietnam was timely though delays occurred on high workload days. Mandatory SARS-CoV-2 testing at arrival may reduce contact tracing duration and should be considered as an integrated screening tool for flight passengers from high-risk areas when entering low-transmission settings with limited contact tracing capacity. We recommend a standardized risk-based contact tracing approach for flight passengers during the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic.","Pham, Thai Quang; Hoang, Ngoc-Anh; Quach, Ha-Linh; Nguyen, Khanh Cong; Colquhoun, Samantha; Lambert, Stephen; Duong, Luong Huy; Tran, Quang Dai; Ha, Duc Anh; Phung, Dinh Cong; Ngu, Nghia Duy; Tran, Tu Anh; La, Quang Ngoc; Nguyen, Tai Trong; Le, Quynh Mai Thi; Tran, Duong Nhu; Vogt, Florian; Dang, Duc-Anh",BMC Infect Dis,183,10

The neurological complications in these patients vary based on patient age and underlying comorbidities. Data on clinical features, particularly neurological features, and prognostic factors in children and adolescents are limited. This study provides a concise overview of neurological complications in pediatric COVID-19 cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The retrospective study reviewed medical records of all patients who were admitted to our hospital and were diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay between 11 March 2020 and 30 January 2021. Patients with a positive PCR result were categorized into two groups: outpatient departments patients and inpatient departments (IPD). RESULTS: Of the 2530 children who underwent RT-PCR during the study period, 382 (8.6%) were confirmed as COVID-19 positive, comprising 188 (49.2%) girls and 194 (50.8%) boys with a mean age of 7.14±5.84 (range, 0-17) years. Neurological complications that required hospitalization were present in 34 (8.9%) patients, including seizure (52.9%), headache (38.2%), dizziness (11.1%) and meningoencephalitis (5.8%). CONCLUSION: The results indicated that neurological manifestations are not rare in children suffering from COVID-19. Seizures, headaches, dizziness, anosmia, ageusia and meningoencephalitis are major neurological manifestations during acute COVID-19 disease. Although seizures were the most common cause of hospitalization in IPD patients, the frequency of meningoencephalitis was quite high. Seizures were observed as febrile seizures for children under 6 years of age and afebrile seizures for those over 6 years of age. Febrile seizure accounted for half of all seizure children.","Dilber, Beril; Aydin, Zeynep Gökçe Gayretli; Yesilbas, Osman; Sag, Elif; Aksoy, Nurdan Kayki; Gündogmus, Firat; Küçükalioglu, Burcu Pariltan; Yilmaz, Semra Atasoy; Demirhan, Yeseren Nil; Çelik, Nursen; Karaca, Abdullah; Ertem, Nese Yalçin; Özdemir, Ramazan; Aksoy, Halil Ibrahim; Öztürk, Emine Esra; Saygin, Berna; Acar, Filiz Aktürk",J. trop. pedriatr,183,24

The fear of infection by patients with concomitant rheumatic diseases (either adult or children) and connective tissue diseases is arising worldwide, because of their immunological background and immunological therapies. Analysing the basic biology of single diseases, the data suggest that there is an ""immunological umbrella"" that seems to protect against the infection, through IFN type 1 and NK cell function. To date, reports from China, United States and Europe did not reveal an higher risk of infection, either for rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis nor for lupus erythematosus. Antimalarials, anti-IL6-Anti-IL6 receptor, anti-IL1, anti-GM-CSF receptor and JAK1/2/3 inhibitors, are under investigation in COVID-dedicated clinical trials to control the inflammation raised by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Cancer has been reported as a major risk factor for adverse outcomes of and death from COVID-19. We extracted data from the World Health Organization's progress reports and from the Italian Council of Medicine. In addition, we retrieved clinical data on patients with cancer and with confirmed COVID-19 in our institution. As of 2nd April 2020, 110,574 COVID-19 cases and 13,157 deaths have been reported in Italy, representing a global share of 5.1% and 28.9% for incidence and mortality, respectively. In Italy, we report the analysis of the Italian Medical Council on 909 patients who died from COVID-19; of whom, 16.5% were patients with cancer. The population was enriched with subjects with multiple comorbid non-communicable diseases, with less than 1% of the population presenting no comorbid conditions. At the patient level, we identified nine patients referred to our department in the last two months who were receiving standard-of-care or experimental medications in the curative and palliative settings. The median age was 68 years (range = 42-79 years), and patients carried a median of one comorbid condition (0-2); two of nine patients presented with severe COVID-19 and were receiving inpatient care. None of the patients receiving immunotherapy experienced severe adverse outcomes, and four patients were discharged with complete reversal of the clinical syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Learning from the experience of countries with a high burden, efforts must be made to assure the access of patients with cancer to treatments, prioritising the cancer health interventions based on their intrinsic value and limiting the exposure to an unacceptable risk of infection for both health providers and patients.

Department of public health need powerful models to model and predict the trend and scale of such pandemic. And models that could evaluate the effect of the public policy are also essential to the fight with the COVID-19. A main limitation of existing models is that they can only evaluate the policy by calculating $R_0$ after infection happens instead of giving observable index. To tackle this, based on the transmission character of the COVID-19, we preposed a novel framework Spatial-Temporal-Susceptible-Infected-Removed (STSIR) model. In particular, we merged both intra-city and inter-city mobility index with the traditional SIR dynamics and make it a dynamic system. And we proved that the STSIR system is a closed system which makes the system self-consistent. And finally we proposed a Multi-Stage Simulated Annealing (MSSA) algorithm to find optimal parameter of the system. In our experiments, based on Baidu Mobility dataset, and China pandemic dataset provided by Dingxiangyuan, our model can effectively predict the total scale of the pandemic and also gives clear policy analysis with observable index.","Pan, Wang; Deng, Qipu; Li, Jiadong; Wang, Zhi; Zhu, Wenwu",,183,2

METHODS: We conducted documentary research, using framework analysis to analyse reports, legislation, decrees, and other official documents that communicated measures taken in response to the pandemic, published from February 1st until May 22nd, 2020. We included documents reporting measures that affected disabled people either directly (measures specifically designed for disabled people) or indirectly (measures for the general population). We developed an analytical framework based on recommendations for disability-inclusive response to COVID-19 published by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Carribean, the World Health Organisation, and other international organisations. RESULTS: We analysed 72 documents. The findings highlight that while some positive measures were taken, the needs of disabled people were not fully considered. Several countries published recommendations for a disability-inclusive response to COVID-19, without ensuring their translation to practice. All countries took at least some steps to ensure access to financial support, health, and education for disabled people, but at the same time they also implemented policies that had a detrimental impact on disabled people. The populations that are most exposed to the impacts of COVID-19, including disabled people living in institutional care, were protected in several cases only by recommendations rather by legislation. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates how the official government responses taken by four countries in the region - while positive, in several aspects - do not fully address the needs of disabled people, thus further disadvantaging them. In order to ensure response to COVID - 19 is disability inclusive, it is necessary to translate recommendations to practice, consider disabled people both in mainstream policy and in disability-specific measures, and focus on the long-term reconstruction phase.","Sakellariou, Dikaios; Malfitano, Ana Paula Serrata; Rotarou, Elena S",Int J Equity Health,183,16

Methods: A prospective cohort study. Primary outcome was improvement at day 14 defined as alive, not on mechanical ventilation, and moderate, mild, or recovered from COVID-19. Antibody levels in CP units were unknown at the time of treatment. IgG against the spike protein S1 was subsequently measured by ELISA. Neutralizing antibodies titers were determined in a subset. Outcome was assessed in relation to the mean antibody level transfused to the patients (&#8804;4.0 versus >4.0). Findings: Of 49 patients, 11 (22.4%) had moderate, 38 (77.6%) had severe disease, 28 were ventilated. At day 14, 24 (49.0%) patients improved, 9 (18.4%) died, and 13 (26.5%) were ventilated. In 14/98 (14.3%) CP units IgG was < 1.1 (cutoff calibration) and in 60 (61.2%) &#8804;4.0. IgG level and neutralizing antibody titer were correlated (0.85 p < 0.001).

Healthcare personnel who presented with COVID-19 symptoms, in different 3 hospitals were invited to take Paramix (nitazoxanide), 500 mg orally, every 6 h for 2 days and then 500 mg twice a day for 4 days. To compare the hospitalization percentage, a group of healthcare workers with a respiratory viral infection without COVID-19 criteria were also followed-up. Over a period of 3 months, 150 healthcare workers (111 women and 39 men) presented respiratory symp- toms with COVID-19 criteria (mean age, 36±10.6 years;range, 18-68 years).

The number of cases has increased rapidly. Patients with severe disease have a poor prognosis, and there are no effective therapies for COVID-19. Only rapid advice guidelines for symptomatic supportive care have been used. A traditional Chinese medicine rehabilitation (TCMR) program consisting of acupressure therapy and Liu Zi Jue Qigong can be used as a complementary therapy for COVID-19. Hence, we designed a randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and advantages of TCMR for treating patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a parallel-design, two-arm, analyst assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial. A total of 128 patients with COVID-19 aged from 20 to 80 years will be recruited and assigned randomly into a guideline therapy group and a guideline therapy plus TCMR group at a 1:1 ratio. Patients in both groups will receive guideline therapy. The patients in the intervention group will perform acupressure therapy and Liu Zi Jue Qigong exercises in addition to conventional treatments twice a day and will be persistent from admission to discharge. The primary outcome will be measured with the Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, and the secondary outcomes will include the Activities of Daily Living Barthel Index Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Scale, and the Respiratory Symptoms Scale. The assessments of the clinical scales will be performed at three points (before treatment, the 7th day during hospitalization, and the discharge day). Adverse events will be noted and recorded for the safety evaluation. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide high-quality evidence of the value of TCMR, which consists of acupressure therapy and Liu Zi Jue Qigong exercises, for treating patients with severe COVID-19.

In 15 studies with vaccinated macaques, it was found that the load of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, subgenomic RNA and infectious virus in the upper respiratory tract is variable. Sterilizing immunity was found in none of the animal studies. Major limitations of the animal studies are that the SARS-CoV-2 challenge took place within a few weeks of the final or only vaccine dose, that the viral challenge was often high and, in some studies, administered by up to four routes.

BACKGROUND: The spread of COVID-19 throughout the world determined a series of modifications of several National Health Service organisations, with a potential series of psychological consequences among nurses, who were particularly afflicted by this situation of changes and precariousness. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was carried out from February-April 2020. METHODS: A total of 1,005 nurses employed in different Italian hospital wards, during the COVID-19 pandemic, were recruited. Analyses were based on descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression. The STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies was used in this study. RESULTS: The prevalence of sleep disturbances, moderate anxiety and low self-efficacy was 71.4%, 33.23% and 50.65%, respectively. We found a positive correlation between anxiety and sleep quality (0.408; p < .0001) and negative correlations between self-efficacy and anxiety (-0.217; p < .0001) and sleep quality and self-efficacy (-0.134; p < .0001). The factor independently associated with all variables was gender. Females were more prone to sleep disturbances, anxiety and low levels of self-efficacy than males (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anxiety, sleep disorders and low self-efficacy among Italian nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic was high. Healthcare managers should recognise and consider these results to reduce the risk of the onset of major mental problems that could result in post-traumatic stress disorder. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses facing major incidents as COVID-19 pandemic are among healthcare personnel exposed to a high risk to develop psychological disturbance that should be assessed and recognised, in order to find helpful coping strategies to inform support services and avoid to hesitate in post-traumatic stress disorders.","Simonetti, Valentina; Durante, Angela; Ambrosca, Rossella; Arcadi, Paola; Graziano, Giusi; Pucciarelli, Gianluca; Simeone, Silvio; Vellone, Ercole; Alvaro, Rosaria; Cicolini, Giancarlo",J. clin. nurs,183,5

This study aims to understand if the perceived crowding and the health risk perception related to the pandemic situation might threaten passengers’ intentions to cruise. The study also examines corporate reputation and trust, as well as social motivation and self-confidence, as possible predictors of consumers’ intention to cruise. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on the development of a structured questionnaire submitted online via social media. Overall, 553 individuals’ responses were used for understanding the factors that can affect consumers’ intention to cruise by performing several regression models. Findings: The results show that the perceived crowding related to the pandemic does not seem to influence people’s intention to cruise. On the contrary, trust in the cruise company, corporate reputation, cruisers’ self-confidence and research of social motivation are positive predictors of intention to cruise, thus reducing the perceived risk’s deterring impact. The importance of such factors differs in respect of repeat and not repeat cruisers. Practical implications: The study presents several managerial implications as it analyses the variables that could help cruise management cope better with COVID-19’s negative impact. Originality/value: Despite the severity of COVID-19’s impact on the cruise industry, no studies have yet focussed on how the current pandemic situation may influence customers’ intention to cruise in the future. © 2021, Sandro Castaldo, Lara Penco and Giorgia Profumo.","Castaldo, S.; Penco, L.; Profumo, G.",International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management,183,32

OBJECTIVE: We compared the chest radiographic findings of MIS-C with those of COVID-19 and described other distinguishing imaging features of MIS-C. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series review of children ages 0 to 18 years who were hospitalized at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta from March to May 2020 and who either met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition for MIS-C (n=11) or who had symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (n=16). Two radiologists reviewed the most severe chest radiographs for each patient. The type and distribution of pulmonary opacities and presence or absence of pleural effusions were recorded. The chest radiographs were categorized based on potential COVID-19 imaging findings as typical, indeterminate, atypical or negative. An imaging severity score was also assigned using a simplified version of the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema Score. Findings were statistically compared between patients with MIS-C and those with COVID-19. Additional imaging findings of MIS-C were also described. RESULTS: Radiographic features of MIS-C included pleural effusions (82% [9/11]), pulmonary consolidations (73% [8/11]) and ground glass opacities (91% [10/11]). All of the lung opacities (100% [10/10]) were bilateral, and the majority of the pleural effusions (67% [6/9]) were bilateral. Compared to children with COVID-19, children with MIS-C were significantly more likely to develop pleural effusions on chest radiograph (82% [9/11] vs. 0% [0/0], P-value <0.01) and a lower zone predominance of pulmonary opacifications (100% [10/10] vs. 38% [5/13], P-value <0.01). Children with MIS-C who also had abdominal imaging had intra-abdominal inflammatory changes. CONCLUSION: Key chest radiographic features of MIS-C versus those of COVID-19 were pleural effusions and lower zone pulmonary opacifications as well as intra-abdominal inflammation. Elucidating the distinguishing radiographic features of MIS-C may help refine the case definition and expedite diagnosis and treatment.","Rostad, Bradley S; Shah, Jay H; Rostad, Christina A; Jaggi, Preeti; Richer, Edward J; Linam, Leann E; Alazraki, Adina L; Riedesel, Erica L; Milla, Sarah S",Pediatr Radiol,183,16

Labeled as the ""pandemic within a pandemic"", African Americans and Hispanics are bearing more of the brunt of the disease compared to Caucasians. Testing a new sequential mediation model on a sample of 483 US African American, Caucasian, and Hispanic adults, the present study investigates the role of fear of COVID-19, information receptivity, perceived knowledge, and self-efficacy to explain disparities in preventive behaviors. Study contributions include the specification of a new predictive model that improves upon the long-used Health Belief Model (HBM). The Sequential Mediation Model appears to have greater explanatory capacity than the HBM. Study results also provide important insights into racial/ethnic differences in health-seeking behavior related to the coronavirus. Findings show that African Americans reported higher levels of preventive behaviors and self-efficacy than Caucasians. It is possible that SES, rather than race per se, is more important in explaining differences in COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Certain ""cues to action"" (precipitating factors) also help explain this somewhat surprising result. Additionally, significant differences were found across the three racial/ethnic groups for all the new model's variables except perceived knowledge. The new model was supported across all three racial/ethnic groups with notable differences across each group. Given the severity of implications surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic (physical, mental, and economic), it is critical that an improved understanding of what drives individual health-seeking behavior be achieved.

We aimed to evaluate the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using a mixed-methods design. METHODS: This longitudinal study drew from a preexisting sample of 957 adults living in Soweto, a major township near Johannesburg. Psychological assessments were administered across two waves between August 2019 and March 2020 and during the first 6 weeks of the lockdown (late March-early May 2020). Interviews on COVID-19 experiences were administered in the second wave. Multiple regression models examined relationships between perceived COVID-19 risk and depression. RESULTS: Full data on perceived COVID-19 risk, depression, and covariates were available in 221 adults. In total, 14.5% of adults were at risk for depression. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk predicted greater depressive symptoms (p < 0.001), particularly among adults with histories of childhood trauma, though this effect was marginally significant (p = 0.063). Adults were about two times more likely to experience significant depressive symptoms for every one unit increase in perceived COVID-19 risk (p = 0.021; 95% CI 1.10-3.39). Qualitative data identified potent experiences of anxiety, financial insecurity, fear of infection, and rumination. CONCLUSIONS: Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection is associated with greater depressive symptoms during the first 6 weeks of quarantine.

We present the case of a 60-year-old patient, diagnosed with a severe form of SARS COV2 infection for which he needed ventilatory support for 20 days, as well as antiviral treatment, systemic corticosteroid, anticoagulant and antibiotic. After 20 days from the first positive RT-PCR test, the patient is considered cured in terms of SARS COV2 infection, but severe respiratory failure requires transfer to the Pulmonology Department of the Marius Nasta Institute for further treatment. Upon admission to the ward, the patient has hypotrophy and hypotonia in the limb muscles, resting dyspnea, bilaterally diminished vesicular murmur, bilateral subcrepitant rales, SaO2 = 72% in aa and rest, 90% with oxygen supplement 8/min.

We sought to investigate to what extent bleeding represents the unmasking of an occult cancer in patients with AF treated with oral anticoagulants. Methods and Results Using data from CardioCHUVI-AF (Retrospective Observational Registry of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation From Vigo's Health Area), 8753 patients with AF aged &#8805;75 years with a diagnosis of AF between 2014 and 2017 were analyzed. Of them, 2171 (24.8%) experienced any clinically relevant bleeding, and 479 (5.5%) were diagnosed with cancer during a follow-up of 3 years. Among 2171 patients who experienced bleeding, 198 (9.1%) were subsequently diagnosed with cancer. Patients with bleeding have a 3-fold higher hazard of being subsequently diagnosed with new cancer compared with those without bleeding (4.7 versus 1.4 per 100 patient-years; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 3.2 [95% CI, 2.6-3.9]). Gastrointestinal bleeding was associated with a 13-fold higher hazard of new gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis (HR, 13.4; 95% CI, 9.1-19.8); genitourinary bleeding was associated with an 18-fold higher hazard of new genitourinary cancer diagnosis (HR, 18.1; 95% CI, 12.5-26.2); and bronchopulmonary bleeding was associated with a 15-fold higher hazard of new bronchopulmonary cancer diagnosis (HR, 15.8; 95% CI, 6.0-41.3). For other bleeding (nongastrointestinal, nongenitourinary, nonbronchopulmonary), the HR for cancer was 2.3 (95% CI, 1.5-3.6). Conclusions In patients with AF treated with oral anticoagulant therapy, any gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or bronchopulmonary bleeding was associated with higher rates of new cancer diagnosis. These bleeding events should prompt investigation for cancers at those sites.","Raposeiras Roubín, Sergio; Abu Assi, Emad; Barreiro Pardal, Cristina; Cespón Fernandez, María; Muñoz Pousa, Isabel; Cobas Paz, Rafael; Parada, Jose Antonio; Represa Montenegro, Marta; Melendo Miu, María; Blanco Prieto, Sonia; Rosselló, Xavier; Ibañez, Borja; Íñiguez Romo, Andrés",J Am Heart Assoc,183,16

Our results provide compelling insights for policy-makers, including the significance of early testing and the emergence of a second wave of infections if NPIs are prematurely withdrawn.","Hota, Ashish R.; Godbole, Jaydeep; Bhariya, Pradhuman; Par'e, Philip E",,183,16

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the timing of surges in clinical demand and the best- and worst-case scenarios of local COVID-19-induced strain on hospital capacity, and thus inform clinical operations and staffing demands and identify when hospital capacity would be saturated. DESIGN: Monte Carlo simulation instantiation of a susceptible, infected, removed (SIR) model with a 1-day cycle. SETTING: 3 hospitals in an academic health system. PATIENTS: All people living in the greater Philadelphia region. MEASUREMENTS: The COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model (CHIME) (http://penn-chime.phl.io) SIR model was used to estimate the time from 23 March 2020 until hospital capacity would probably be exceeded, and the intensity of the surge, including for intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators. RESULTS: Using patients with COVID-19 alone, CHIME estimated that it would be 31 to 53 days before demand exceeds existing hospital capacity. In best- and worst-case scenarios of surges in the number of patients with COVID-19, the needed total capacity for hospital beds would reach 3131 to 12 650 across the 3 hospitals, including 338 to 1608 ICU beds and 118 to 599 ventilators. LIMITATIONS: Model parameters were taken directly or derived from published data across heterogeneous populations and practice environments and from the health system's historical data. CHIME does not incorporate more transition states to model infection severity, social networks to model transmission dynamics, or geographic information to account for spatial patterns of human interaction. CONCLUSION: Publicly available and designed for hospital operations leaders, this modeling tool can inform preparations for capacity strain during the early days of a pandemic.

Although patients primarily present with fever, cough and dyspnea, some patients also develop gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic manifestations. The most common GI symptoms reported are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. Liver chemistry abnormalities are common and include elevation of aspartate transferase, alanine transferase, and total bilirubin. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects the GI tract via its viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II, which is expressed on enterocytes of the ileum and colon. Viral RNA has also been isolated from stool specimens of COVID-19 patients, which raised the concern for fecal-oral transmission in addition to droplet transmission. Although indirect evidence has suggested possible fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, more effort is needed to establish the role of the fecal-oral transmission route. Further research will help elucidate the association between patients with underlying GI diseases, such as chronic liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease, and severity of COVID-19. In this review, we summarize the data on GI involvement to date, as well as the impact of COVID-19 on underlying GI diseases.","Cha, Ming Han; Regueiro, Miguel; Sandhu, Dalbir S",World J Gastroenterol,183,3

Currently, to our knowledge, there is no effective pharmacologic prophylaxis for individuals at risk. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital-based HCWs with exposure to patients with COVID-19 using a pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 With Hydroxychloroquine Study) was conducted at 2 tertiary urban hospitals, with enrollment from April 9, 2020, to July 14, 2020; follow-up ended August 4, 2020. The trial randomized 132 full-time, hospital-based HCWs (physicians, nurses, certified nursing assistants, emergency technicians, and respiratory therapists), of whom 125 were initially asymptomatic and had negative results for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab. The trial was terminated early for futility before reaching a planned enrollment of 200 participants. Interventions: Hydroxychloroquine, 600 mg, daily, or size-matched placebo taken orally for 8 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by a nasopharyngeal swab during the 8 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects, treatment discontinuation, presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, frequency of QTc prolongation, and clinical outcomes for SARS-CoV-2-positive participants. Results: Of the 132 randomized participants (median age, 33 years [range, 20-66 years]; 91 women [69%]), 125 (94.7%) were evaluable for the primary outcome. There was no significant difference in infection rates in participants randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo (4 of 64 [6.3%] vs 4 of 61 [6.6%]; P > .99). Mild adverse events were more common in participants taking hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo (45% vs 26%; P = .04); rates of treatment discontinuation were similar in both arms (19% vs 16%; P = .81). The median change in QTc (baseline to 4-week evaluation) did not differ between arms (hydroxychloroquine: 4 milliseconds; 95% CI, -9 to 17; vs placebo: 3 milliseconds; 95% CI, -5 to 11; P = .98). Of the 8 participants with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 (6.4%), 6 developed viral symptoms; none required hospitalization, and all clinically recovered. Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, although limited by early termination, there was no clinical benefit of hydroxychloroquine administered daily for 8 weeks as pre-exposure prophylaxis in hospital-based HCWs exposed to patients with COVID-19.

Thus teaching students how to manage their data properly may help the progress of the field and aid the students in their future careers. I have developed an activity to inform students on data management practices and have them apply their lessons to a mock data set. In this activity, students take a poorly organized and formatted data set which students organize, reformat, then write a README file to describe the organization and contents of the data set to others. Students perform this activity on the Open Science Framework and have to physically organize the data as well as open the files to reformat and clean the data. Afterward, students reflect on the experience and how they may change their management of data.

While physiological role protects the host, pathophysiological role can substantially harm the host, by triggering several hyper-inflammatory pathways, referred as ""hypercytokinaemia"". Emerging clinical evidence suggests that exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), tricks the complement to aberrantly activate the ""hypercytokinaemia"" loop, which significantly contributes to the severity of the COVID19. The pathophysiological response of the complement is usually amplified by the over production of potent chemoattractants and inflammatory modulators, like C3a and C5a. Therefore, it is logical that neutralizing the harmful effects of the inflammatory modulators of the complement system can be beneficial for the management of COVID19. While the hunt for safe and efficacious vaccines were underway, polypharmacology based combination therapies were fairly successful in reducing both the morbidity and mortality of COVID19 across the globe. Repurposing of small molecule drugs as ""neutraligands"" of C5a appears to be an alternative for modulating the hyper-inflammatory signals, triggered by the C5a-C5aR signaling axes. Thus, in the current study, few specific and non-specific immunomodulators (azithromycin, colchicine, famotidine, fluvoxamine, dexamethasone and prednisone) generally prescribed for prophylactic usage for management of COVID19 were subjected to computational and biophysical studies to probe whether any of the above drugs can act as ""neutraligands"", by selectively binding to C5a over C3a. The data presented in this study indicates that corticosteroids, like prednisone can have potentially better selectively (Kd â¼ 0.38 µM) toward C5a than C3a, suggesting the positive modulatory role of C5a in the general success of the corticosteroid therapy in moderate to severe COVID19.","Das, Aurosikha; Rana, Soumendra",Comput Biol Chem,183,16

Initial studies from New York City suggested more severe disease among PLWH but this was during a time when hospitals were over-capacity and health systems stretched. This report presents the incidence and outcomes among people living with HIV (PLWH) with COVID-19 in San Francisco over the first six months of the pandemic. METHODS: Community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in San Francisco on March 5, 2020. This report examines the match of the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) COVID-19 testing database and the SFDPH HIV Surveillance case registry from March 24-September 3, 2020. RESULTS: Among 4252 COVID-19 tests performed among PLWH, 4.5% (N=193) were positive for COVID-19, compared to a 3.5% (N=9626) positivity rate among the 272,555 people without HIV tested for COVID-19 (p<0.001). Mean age of those infected with HIV/COVID-19 was 48 years (20-76); 38.9% White, 38.3% Latinx, 11.9% Black; 91.2% were male. Only 54.6% of coinfected PLWH were housed, with the remainder marginally housed. The rate of severe illness with COVID-19 was not increased among PLWH. DISCUSSION: In San Francisco, susceptibility to COVID-19 was increased among PLWH over the first six months of the pandemic, although outcomes were similar to those without HIV. Homelessness and higher rates of congregate living situations among PLWH likely accounted for this disparity. Special efforts to house patients with marginal housing during the COVID-19 pandemic are needed.","Sachdev, Darpun; Mara, Elise; Hsu, Ling; Scheer, Susan; Rutherford, George; Enanoria, Wayne; Gandhi, Monica",J. acquir. immune defic. syndr,183,8

We investigated time-varying associations between daily time to oneself and loneliness, and the role of everyday creativity as a resource. METHODS: 126 adults aged 18-84 completed online questionnaires including a 10-day daily diary module, during which they self-reported alone time, everyday creativity, and loneliness. Data were analyzed using multilevel models, controlling for study day, participation date, gender, and relationship status. RESULTS: Greater average amounts of alone time were associated with greater loneliness, an association that was stronger in old age. In a daily context, individuals reported feeling lonelier on days when they had more time to themselves than usual. This within-person association was weaker with older age. Everyday creativity did not moderate alone time-loneliness associations. However, holding time to oneself constant, participants felt less lonely and less bothered by alone time on days when they were more creative than usual. DISCUSSION: Participating in creative behaviors (e.g., pursuing arts and crafts) might be linked with reduced loneliness. Intervention studies are needed to investigate whether fostering creativity could help promote mental well-being in times when people, especially older adults, are vulnerable to loneliness and associated health risks.","Pauly, Theresa; Chu, Li; Zambrano, Elizabeth; Gerstorf, Denis; Hoppmann, Christiane A",,183,10

Upon stimulation, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) act as sensors to activate innate immune responses, containing NF-&#954;B signaling, IFN response, and inflammasome activation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and other nucleic acid sensors are involved in innate immune responses. The activation of innate immune responses can facilitate the host to eliminate pathogens and maintain tissue homeostasis. However, the activity of innate immune responses needs to be tightly controlled to ensure the optimal intensity and duration of activation under various contexts. Uncontrolled innate immune responses can lead to various disorders associated with aberrant inflammatory response, including pulmonary diseases such as COPD, asthma, and COVID-19. In this chapter, we will have a broad overview of how innate immune responses function and the regulation and activation of innate immune response at molecular levels as well as their contribution to various pulmonary diseases. A better understanding of such association between innate immune responses and pulmonary diseases may provide potential therapeutic strategies.","Liu, Tao; Liu, Siqi; Zhou, Xiaobo",Adv Exp Med Biol,183,21

The COVID-19 refers to the disease while the SARS-CoV-2 refers to the virus and is characterized by a rapid contagious capacity able to spread worldwide in a very short time. The rise in the number of infected patients and deaths is of great concern especially because symptoms are vague and similar to other forms of flu infection and corona syndrome infections characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. According to the latest guidelines published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the diagnosis of COVID-19 must be confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or gene sequencing of specimen obtained from throat, sputum and blood samples. However, the limitations due to logistics, as well as low sensitivity and specificity diagnostic tools currently available have been reported as the main cause of high incidence of either false-negative or positive results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The purpose of the present translational research protocol is to discuss and present the original findings from our research team on new diagnostic technique to detect four Coronaviridae family members (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, HCoV and MERS-CoV), highlighting the methodology, the procedure and the possible advantages. Moreover, the authors review the current epidemiology, precautions and safety measures for health personnel to manage patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Implementation of an effective and rapid plan of diagnosing, screening and checking is a key factor to reduce and prevent further transmission. This procedure based on rRT-PCR could be of great help to decisively validate the results obtained from more conventional diagnostic procedures such as chest computed tomography (CT) imaging and chest ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: This translational diagnostic tool will assist emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in effectively managing people with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2.","Pham, V H; Gargiulo Isacco, C; Nguyen, K C D; Le, S H; Tran, D K; Nguyen, Q V; Pham, H T; Aityan, S; Pham, S T; Cantore, S; Inchingolo, A M; Inchingolo, A D; Dipalma, G; Ballini, A; Inchingolo, F",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,183,1

To support this argument, we examine data from the Canadian Quality of Work and Economic Life Study, two national surveys of Canadian workers-one from late September 2019 (N = 2,477) and the second from mid-March 2020 (N = 2,446). Analyses show that subjective isolation and community distrust increased between the two surveys, which led to a substantial rise in psychological distress. Increases in subjective isolation were stronger in older respondents, resulting in a greater escalation in psychological distress. These findings support a Durkheimian perspective on the harm to social integration and mental health caused by periods of rapid social change but also illustrate how a life course context can differentiate individual vulnerability to disintegrative social forces.","Bierman, Alex; Schieman, Scott",J Health Soc Behav,183,16

Moreover, it is unknown whether endogenously derived antibodies drive viral clearance that might result in mitigation of clinical severity during natural infection. We developed a series of non-linear mathematical models to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 viral and antibody kinetics are coupled or governed by separate processes. Patients with severe disease had a higher production rate of IgG but not IgM antibodies. Maximal levels of both isotypes were governed by their production rate rather than different saturation levels between people. Our results suggest that an exponential surge in IgG levels occurs approximately 5-10 days after symptom onset with no requirement for continual antigenic stimulation. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies appear to have limited to no effect on viral dynamics but may enhance viral clearance late during primary infection resulting from the binding effect of antibody to virus, rather than neutralization. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies may play only a limited role in clearing infection from the nasal passages despite providing long-term immunity against infection following vaccination or prior infection.","Yang, Shuyi; Jerome, Keith R; Greninger, Alexander L; Schiffer, Joshua T; Goyal, Ashish",Viruses,183,16

Due to the high infectivity, countries make calls to stay at home or take measures such as lockdowns to ensure that people are least affected by the virus. Meanwhile, infected people are getting treatments: people who are slightly affected are quarantined at home, and those who are heavily affected are treated in hospitals. Hence there is an excessive increase in the hospital workload. This causes physical fatigue in healthcare professionals. Along with the increasing workload, the fear of being infected and infecting the environment causes psychological problems in healthcare professionals. It is important to protect healthcare professionals and provide them with suitable working conditions. For this reason, besides the provision of protective equipment such as gloves, overalls, mask, and glasses that are necessary for the protection of healthcare workers from the virus, healthcare services should also be planned very carefully. One of the critical issues is planning the shift schedules of the physicians. In this study, we handle the preparation of a physician shift schedule of a hospital in Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hospital has established three new COVID-19 related departments and the aim is to provide continuous service in the new departments while maintaining the workload in the existing departments. We propose a mixed integer programming (MIP) model to address the shift scheduling problem and transform it into a decision support system (DSS).

METHOD: We designed and fielded an original representative survey of 3,000 American adults between March 20-23, 2020 to collect data on a battery of 38 health-related behaviors, government policy preferences on COVID-19 response and worries about the pandemic. We test for partisan differences COVID-19 related policy attitudes and behaviors, measured in three different ways: party affiliation, intended 2020 Presidential vote, and self-placed ideological positioning. Our multivariate approach adjusts for a wide range of individual demographic and geographic characteristics that might confound the relationship between partisanship and health behaviors, attitudes, and preferences. RESULTS: We find that partisanship-measured as party identification, support for President Trump, or left-right ideological positioning-explains differences in Americans across a wide range of health behaviors and policy preferences. We find no consistent evidence that controlling for individual news consumption, the local policy environment, and local pandemic-related deaths erases the observed partisan differences in health behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes. In further analyses, we use a LASSO regression approach to select predictors, and find that a partisanship indicator is the most commonly selected predictor across the 38 dependent variables that we study. CONCLUSION: Our analysis of individual self-reported behavior, attitudes, and policy preferences in response to COVID-19 reveals that partisanship played a central role in shaping individual responses in the earliest months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the present study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the influent wastewater samples (n = 43) from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Gandhinagar, India, during August 7th to September 30th, 2020. A total of 40 samples out of 43 were found positive i.e. having at least two genes of SARS-CoV-2. The average Ct values for S, N, and ORF 1 ab genes were 32.66, 33.03, and 33.95, respectively. Monthly variation depicted a substantial rise in the average copies of N (~120%) and ORF 1 ab (~38%) genes in the month of September as compared to August, while S-gene copies declined by 58% in September 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 genome concentration was higher in the month of September (~924.5 copies/L) than August (~897.5 copies/L), corresponding to a ~2.2-fold rise in the number of confirmed cases during the study period. Further, the percentage change in genome concentration level on a particular date was found in the lead of 1-2 weeks of time with respect to the official confirmed cases registered based on clinical tests on a temporal scale. The results profoundly unravel the potential of WBE surveillance to predict the fluctuation of COVID-19 cases to provide an early warning. Our study explicitly suggests that it is the need of hour that the wastewater surveillance must be included as an integral part of COVID-19 pandemic monitoring which can not only help the water authorities to identify the hotspots within a city but can provide up to 2 weeks of time lead for better tuning the management interventions.","Kumar, Manish; Joshi, Madhvi; Patel, Arbind Kumar; Joshi, Chaitanya G",Environ Res,183,26

COVID19 was first reported in December, 2019 and after several observations of cutaneous involvement in patients with the disease there was need to document such in literature. The details of the clinical presentation and the pathophysiological mechanisms of these cutaneous lesions are, however, still poorly understood. This is a review of twenty-four published scientific articles summarizing the various cutaneous features observed by the frontline health care givers involved in the management of patients with Covid-19. Maculopapular exanthem was the most common pattern reported, accounting for 44.4% of skin manifestations. The pseudo-chilblain, urticarial, vesicular, livedoid and Kawasaki-like disease patterns accounted for 18.1%, 17.6%, 12.9%, 5.1% and 1.9% respectively. Anumber of the patients (9.5%) developed skin lesions at the time of diagnosis of Covid-19 or at the onset of Covid-19 respiratory symptoms while 75.1% developed the lesions after the onset of Covid-19 respiratory symptoms or after laboratory diagnosis of the disease had been made. There is no gainsaying that apart from the respiratory and other reported systems, Covid-19 also affects the skin. Clinicians, especially dermatologists, should therefore watch out for the already reported skin lesions and for possible yet to be discovered or reported skin lesions in patients with Covid-19. Dermatologists must bear in mind that patients presenting at skin clinics may actually be infected with Covid-19.","Enitan, A O; Olasode, O A",West Afr J Med,183,24

Africa is the last continent to be hit by this pandemic and the population is still prone to misconceptions and may not take it seriously. In developing countries including Ethiopia, where trained human resources and equipment for the treatment of COVID-19 are scarce, working on prevention of the viral spread should be a priority as a feasible intervention strategy. The aim of this study was to determine the level of knowledge, attitude, practice (KAP) towards COVID-19 and its prevalence among hospital visitors. METHODS: Health institution based cross sectional study was conducted among 513 hospital visitors who are recruited by using simple random sampling technique at Ataye district hospital, Northeast Ethiopia from June 3, 2020 to August 10, 2020. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used to obtain information related to socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge (11 questions), attitude (9 questions) and practice (9 questions). Oro-pharyngeal specimen was collected by trained healthcare provider and processed in a molecular laboratory. After extraction of viral nucleic acid, the Real-time fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit was used for detecting novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Data was analyzed using bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression model with 95% CI (confidence interval). From the bi-variable analysis, variables having a P-value <0.25 were retained into multivariable analysis. From the multivariable analysis, variables with a P-value <0.05 was declared as associated factors. RESULTS: Majority (72.9%) of the study participants were male; and most were urban dwellers. From the total study participants, 17 (3.3%) were found to be infected with the virus. The magnitude of low-level of knowledge was 4.9%; and of the analyzed risk factors, female gender, age (category less than 16 years and category between 16 and 65 years), and usual alcohol drinking habit had statistically significant association with low level knowledge. The proportion of study participants who had low level of practice was 75/513 (14.62%). Family size, age category between 16 and 65 years, and low-level knowledge were associated with low-level practice. CONCLUSION: Limited number of study participants had high-level knowledge and practice towards COVID-19; while majority of the study candidates demonstrated moderate level of knowledge and practice. Good knowledge, positive attitude and good practice can be a guarantee for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Hence, various measurements to combat the pandemic should be taken by different stakeholders including the community members, religious leader, health professionals and others.","Gebretsadik, Daniel; Ahmed, Nuru; Kebede, Edosa; Gebremicheal, Saba; Belete, Melaku Ashagrie; Adane, Metadel",PLoS One,183,6

The pathogen stands out among other coronaviruses by its rapid transmission from human to human, with the majority of infected individuals being asymptomatic or presenting with only minor illness, therefore facilitating the pathogen spread. At the same time, people from the risk groups, such as the elderly, patients suffering from chronic diseases, or obese individuals, have increased chances of developing a severe or even fatal disease. The search for risk factors explaining this phenomenon continues. In this review, we focus on the known mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection affecting the functioning of the immune system and discuss potential risk factors responsible for the severe disease course. Oxidative stress is one of such factors, which plays a prominent role in innate immunity activity, and recent research has revealed its tight involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We discuss these recent findings and the development of excessive inflammation and cytokine storm observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Many countries are facing increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, which are, in their origin mostly attributed to regular international flight connections with China. This study aims to investigate this relation by analyzing available data on air traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 cases. METHODS: and findings: We analyzed available data on current domestic and international passenger volume and flight routes and compared these to the distribution of domestic and international COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Our data indicate a strong linear correlation between domestic COVID-19 cases and passenger volume for regions within China (r2 = 0.92, p = 0.19) and a significant correlation between international COVID-19 cases and passenger volume (r2 = 0.98, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The number of flight routes as well as total passenger volume are highly relevant risk factors for the spread of current COVID-19. Multiple regions within Asia, as well as some in North America and Europe are at serious risk of constant exposure to COVID-19 from China and other highly infected countries. Risk for COVID-19 exposure remains relatively low in South America and Africa. If adequate measures are taken, including on-site disease detection and temporary passenger quarantine, limited but not terminated air traffic can be a feasible option to prevent a long-term crisis. Reasonable risk calculations and case evaluations per passenger volume are crucial aspects which must be considered when reducing international flights.","Lau, Hien; Khosrawipour, Veria; Kocbach, Piotr; Mikolajczyk, Agata; Ichii, Hirohito; Zacharski, Maciej; Bania, Jacek; Khosrawipour, Tanja",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,183,1

The protocols to be tested were selected based on the literature: 10% KOH at 40 °C for 24 h; 10% KOH at 60 °C for 24 h; diluted NaClO at room temperature (~20 °C) for 15 h; 30% H2O2 at 40 °C for 48 h; Fenton's reagent with 30% H2O2 for 2 h at room temperature (~20 °C). The fibers were characterized before and after digestion. The effects of those protocols on fibers integrity have been assessed using several of their performance parameters. High degradations were observed for PET with 10% KOH 60 °C whereas almost no impact was observed at 40 °C. H2O2 digestion affects mechanical properties of different fibers, particularly PA 6.6. Both protocols should be avoided for synthetic fibers analyses. NaClO digestion mainly affected flax and viscose.

The conducted experiments for lung region segmentation showed a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 97.19% and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 95.10% using U-Net model with the DenseNet 161 encoder. Furthermore, the proposed system achieved an elegant performance for COVID-19 infection segmentation with a DSC of 94.13% and IoU of 91.85% using the FPN with DenseNet201 encoder. The proposed system can reliably localize infections of various shapes and sizes, especially small infection regions, which are rarely considered in recent studies. Moreover, the proposed system achieved high COVID-19 detection performance with 99.64% sensitivity and 98.72% specificity. Finally, the system was able to discriminate between different severity levels of COVID-19 infection over a dataset of 1110 subjects with sensitivity values of 98.3%, 71.2%, 77.8%, and 100% for mild, moderate, severe, and critical, respectively.","Qiblawey, Yazan Tahir Anas Chowdhury Muhammad E.

METHODS: Pharmacy directors at 1,437 general and children's medical/surgical hospitals in the United States were surveyed using a mixed-mode method of contact by email and mail. Survey completion was online. RESULTS: The response rate was 18.7%. Seventy-three percent of hospitals implemented changes to hospital units, including 46% that increased intensive care unit bed capacity; 94% made changes to pharmacy supply chain acquisition, changes to products, and/or increased inventory. Staffing changes were implemented by 69% of hospitals, with the most common being staffing reductions (55%) and salary reductions (16%). Medication-use changes were implemented by 86% of hospitals, with treatment guidelines for COVID-19 treatment (79%) and opening compassionate use or investigational drug studies (55%) being the most common. Changes in sterile compounding processes were implemented by 84% of hospitals. Personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages led to 71% of hospitals modifying PPE use standards in sterile compounding. Eighty-seven percent of hospitals changed operational activities, such as changing medication return practices (56%), medication reconciliation processes (46%), intravenous medication recycling (38%), and discharge counseling (37%). Hospitals experienced shortages of many medications, including albuterol inhalers (60%), sedatives and anesthetic agents (58%), neuromuscular blockers (43%), corticosteroids (34%), cardiovascular agents (24%), investigational agents (24%), and dialysis solutions (6%). CONCLUSION: The pharmacy profession responded to myriad threats to operations and patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.","Pedersen, Craig A; Schneider, Philip J; Ganio, Michael C; Scheckelhoff, Douglas J",Am. j. health system pharm,183,7

In this context, many sectors, especially education and training services, which can only be delivered in an organic social context, have had to undergo a rapid formation process through new building dynamics apart from their traditional structural elements. Leading to a crisis in education systems, the pandemic required the urgent development of new education policies, and the prevention of disruption in education through the use of the most widely available technological opportunities available locally. Our study aims to analyze the transformative effect of the 'artificial techno-social network' as the new education and training method during the pandemic period on the education paradigm.

Hence, a COVID-19 mandatory vaccination as a precondition for international travel is being debated in many countries. Thus, the present research aimed to study the intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine as a precondition for international travel using an extended Norm-Activation Model. The study model integrates a new construct, namely mass media coverage on COVID-19 vaccination as additional predictor of intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The survey data were collected from 1221 international travelers. Structural equation modelling shows a very good fit of the final model to the data; the conceptual model based on extended Norm-Activation Model was strongly supported. Awareness of consequences related to the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals' health has shown a positive effect on individuals' ascribed responsibility to adopt emotionally driven (anticipated pride and anticipated guilt) pro-social behaviors that activate a personal norm towards altruistic and pro-mandatory vaccination-friendly behavior.

METHODS: For 118 diabetic patients, laboratory measurements and clinical outcomes were compared between males and females. This study also compared inflammatory ratios obtained from combinations of six inflammatory markers between the two groups. The risk factors for mortality were identified through logistic regression. RESULTS: Males were 54 (45.8%) and females were 64 (54.2%). Males showed a significant increase in ALT (Pâ¯=â¯0.003), CRP (Pâ¯=â¯0.03), mean platelet volume (MPV)-to-lymphocyte ratio (Pâ¯=â¯0.001), and C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (Pâ¯=â¯0.044), whereas females had a significant increase in lymphocytes (Pâ¯<â¯0.005) and MPV (Pâ¯=â¯0.01).

The incidence of new cases of COVID-19 has reduced dramatically since a peak in mid-March. The reduction in international travel, social distancing measures and public health action have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease, in the Australian community. Cases of COVID-19 continue to be notified by jurisdictions, albeit at a slowed rate. Testing rates over the past week have increased markedly, with a very low proportion of people testing positive. These low rates of detection are indicative of low levels of COVID-19 transmission. It is important that testing rates and community adherence to public health measures remain high to support the continued suppression of the virus, particularly in vulnerable high-risk groups and settings. In the past reporting week new cases in Australia are mostly considered to be locally acquired, consistent with the drop in international travel. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a known case or cluster. Although the proportion of locally-acquired cases has increased, the overall rate of cases, regardless of place of acquisition, continues to decrease. The crude case fatality rate in Australia remains low (1.4%), compared with the WHO reported global rate (6.9%). The low case fatality rate is likely reflective of high case detection and high quality of health care services in Australia. Deaths from COVID-19 in Australia have occurred predominantly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, with no deaths occurring in those under 40 years. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years, with a third of these cases associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, cases continue to increase, with some areas such as Brazil and India showing a dramatic rise in reported cases. Although some low-income countries have currently reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of disease occurrence.",,,183,1

The present manuscript shows the presence of morphological and chromatic variations among populations of T. mexicana from the states of Hidalgo (Valle del Mezquital and Meztitlan), Guanajuato and Queretaro. The study employed 136 specimens collected in four locations. Scanning electron microscopy was used to study the morphological characteristics of the head, pronotum, and scutellum; also, we measured the width of the abdomen and the total length in the specimens of each population. The morphometric analysis considered 19 variables in the previous structures. Significant differences were found in the dimensions of the head and pronotum, but not in the scutellum; there is clear discrimination among the four proposed populations. The chromatic patterns observed in the connexivum go from yellow to brown and show some significant differences related to geographical origin. The set of evaluated characters showed a higher degree of difference in the population of Guanajuato, clearly separating from the rest of the populations, indicating the possibility of a divergence process.

In the literature, eggshell (ES) and ESM usage for their adsorbent properties to remove various organic and inorganic hazardous chemicals, especially from wastewater, has gained interest. In addition, agricultural (olive leaf) and food industry (eggshell and eggshell membrane) waste can together be valorized to produce value-added functional products. This study’s objective was to evaluate the eggshell membrane’s loading capacity for bioactive compounds obtained from olive leaf extract (OLE) in order to prepare functional biomaterial. In this study, waste eggshell membranes were used to adsorb the phenolic compounds from olive leaf extract to design functional biomaterials. Using the foam separation method, both separation of the eggshell membrane and adsorption of bioactive compounds to the eggshell membrane were achieved simultaneously. The characterization studies showed that OLE was successfully adsorbed to the eggshell membrane. Cytotoxicity and antimicrobial studies showed that prepared OLE-loaded membranes were functional materials with bioactive properties. In conclusion, ESM was determined as a promising protein in the production of functional antioxidative and antimicrobial food or dietary supplement after the adsorption of bioactive olive leaf polyphenols.","Bayraktar, Oguz Galanakis Charis M.; Aldawoud, Turki M.

So far, the pandemic has caused the death of hundreds of thousands of people upon infection and spreading. To date, no effective vaccine is available which can combat the infection caused by this virus. Therefore, this study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation, three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against the SARS-CoV-2. Thereafter, the molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strategy of the selected vaccine. This study should contribute to uphold the present efforts of the researches to secure a definitive preventative measure against this lethal disease.","Sarkar, Bishajit; Ullah, Md Asad; Johora, Fatema Tuz; Taniya, Masuma Afrin; Araf, Yusha",Immunobiology,183,16

Whereas the definitive pathogenesis of COVID-19-related AKI (CoV-AKI) is not clear, histopathologic evidence seems to point at multiple etiologies for the disease, including indirect and direct viral kidney injury. The high incidence of CoV-AKI, along with the aggressive clinical presentation of this entity, have increased the demands for kidney replacement therapies, rapidly overwhelming the supplies of healthcare systems even in major tertiary care centers. As a result, nephrologists have come up with alternatives to maximize the efficiency of treatments and have developed non-conventional therapeutic alternatives such as the implementation of acute peritoneal dialysis for critically ill patients. The long-term implications of CoV-AKI are yet unknown, though early studies suggest that around one third of the patients who survive will remain dependent on kidney replacement therapy. Nephrologists and healthcare workers need to be familiar with the clinical presentation and therapeutic challenges of CoV-AKI in order to develop strategies to mitigate the burden of the disease for patients, and for services providing kidney replacement therapies.","Sanchez-Russo, Luis; Billah, Marzuq; Chancay, Jorge; Hindi, Judy; Cravedi, Paolo",,183,26

It discusses research from diagnosis and beyond, to patient-team communication with a particular focus on medical trials, adherence and living with CFTR modulators. RECENT FINDINGS: The impact of the diagnosis on parents is immense and the complexity of treatment now and in the future, are a challenge for both parents and teams. Communicating digitally is starting to become daily practice for many in CF care, with coronavirus disease 2019 accelerating this process. Participating in trials has a psychological impact, but most of all the (delayed) access and timing of accessing CFTR modulators is an important theme. Adherence remains of significance, both to 'old' and 'new' treatments. Living with CF in the era of CFTR modulators is beginning to impact on patients' quality of life, including new possibilities, opportunities and challenges. SUMMARY: Psychological care needs to engage and keep pace with the rapid medical changes. Some care priorities remain the same, including psychological screening and assessment, as well as psychoeducation, communication training and psychotherapy.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis summarize the diagnostic information provided by PET/MRI in patients with prostate cancer (PCa). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted in three different databases. The terms used were ""choline"" or ""prostate-specific membrane antigen - PSMA"" AND ""prostate cancer"" or ""prostate"" AND ""PET/MRI"" or ""PET MRI"" or ""PET-MRI"" or ""positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging."" All relevant records identified were combined, and the full texts were retrieved. Reports were excluded if (1) they did not consider hybrid PET/MRI; or (2) the sample size was < 10 patients; or (3) the raw data were not enough to enable the completion of a 2 × 2 contingency table. RESULTS: Fifty articles were eligible for systematic review, and 23 for meta-analysis. The pooled data concerned 2104 patients. Initial disease staging was the main indication for PET/MRI in 24 studies. Radiolabeled PSMA was the tracer most frequently used. In primary tumors, the pooled sensitivity for the patient-based analysis was 94.9%. At restaging, the pooled detection rate was 80.9% and was higher for radiolabeled PSMA than for choline (81.8% and 77.3%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: PET/MRI proved highly sensitive in detecting primary PCa, with a high detection rate for recurrent disease, particularly when radiolabeled PSMA was used.","Evangelista, Laura; Zattoni, Fabio; Cassarino, Gianluca; Artioli, Paolo; Cecchin, Diego; Dal Moro, Fabrizio; Zucchetta, Pietro",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,183,1

Deferral of these visits may have critical health impact, including delayed diagnosis for melanoma and other skin cancers. We examined the influence of the pandemic on skin biopsy rates in a large population-based cohort. METHODS: Using a universal health care claims dataset from Ontario, we examined skin biopsies from January 6, 2020 to September 27, 2020, and compared these to the same period for 2019. Those diagnosed with anogenital cancers, younger than 20 years, residing out-of-province and with lapses in coverage were excluded. The sensitivity and specificity of claims diagnoses compared to a validated algorithm to identify keratinocyte carcinoma (KC), or to the cancer registry for melanoma was evaluated. Factors associated with biopsy during the early pandemic were investigated with modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: A precipitous drop in total skin biopsies (15% of expected), biopsies for KC (18%) and melanoma (27%) was seen with the onset of COVID-19 cases (p<0.01). Claims diagnoses were of high specificity for KC (99%), and for melanoma (98%), though sensitivity was less (61%, 28% respectively). In adjusted analysis, the elderly (80+ years), females and residents of certain regions were less likely to be biopsied during the pandemic. Subsequently, there were substantial improvements in biopsy rates over 10 weeks. However, compared to 2019, a large backlog of expected cases still remained 28 weeks after lockdown (45,710 all biopsy, 9,104 KC, 595 melanoma). INTERPRETATION: A drastic reduction in skin biopsies is noted early in the COVID-19 pandemic; this disproportionately affected the elderly, females and certain geographic regions. Though biopsies subsequently increased, a large backlog of cases remained after almost half a year. This will have implications for downstream care of skin cancer. Efforts should be made to limit diagnostic delay.","Asai, Yuka; Nguyen, Paul; Hanna, Timothy P",PLoS One,183,16

Our aim was to investigate the clinical course and outcome of those patients and to identify factors associated with the need for prolonged ECMO therapy. METHODS: A retrospective single-center study on patients with VV ECMO for COVID-19-associated ARDS was performed. Baseline characteristics, ventilatory and ECMO parameters, and laboratory and virological results were evaluated over time. Six months follow-up was assessed. RESULTS: Eleven of 16 patients (68.8%) survived to 6 months follow-up with four patients requiring short-term (<28 days) and seven requiring prolonged (â©¾28 days) ECMO support. Lung compliance before ECMO was higher in the prolonged than in the short-term group (28.1 (28.8-32.1) ml/cmH2O vs 18.7 (17.7-25.0) ml/cmH2O, p = 0.030). Mechanical ventilation before ECMO was longer (19 (16-23) days vs 5 (5-9) days, p = 0.002) and SOFA score was higher (12.0 (10.5-17.0) vs 10.0 (9.0-10.0), p = 0.002) in non-survivors compared to survivors. Low viral load during the first days on ECMO tended to indicate worse outcomes. Seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2 occurred in all patients, but did not affect outcome. CONCLUSIONS: VV ECMO support for COVID-19-induced ARDS is justified if initiated early and at an experienced ECMO center. Prolonged ECMO therapy might be required in those patients. Although no relevant predictive factors for the duration of ECMO support were found, the decision to stop therapy should not be made dependent of the length of ECMO treatment.","Dreier, Esther; Malfertheiner, Maximilian Valentin; Dienemann, Thomas; Fisser, Christoph; Foltan, Maik; Geismann, Florian; Graf, Bernhard; Lunz, Dirk; Maier, Lars Siegfried; Müller, Thomas; Offner, Robert; Peterhoff, David; Philipp, Alois; Salzberger, Bernd; Schmidt, Barbara; Sinner, Barbara; Lubnow, Matthias",Perfusion,183,29

Mexico was not included in the first-ever report on a global cohort of patients with this coinfection. We report on a case of SARS-CoV-2/MBT coinfection in a 51-year-old taxi driver from Mexico City that underscores the importance of rapid and accurate laboratory testing, diagnosis, and treatment. CASE REPORT We present the case of a man in the sixth decade of life who was admitted to the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER) with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, which was confirmed by nasopharyngeal exudate using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the identification of SARS-CoV-2. Findings from imaging studies suggested that the patient might be coinfected with MBT. That suspicion was confirmed with light microscopy of a sputum sample after Ziehl-Neelsen staining and when a Cepheid Xpert MTB/RIF assay, an automated semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay, failed to detect rifampicin resistance. The patient was discharged from the hospital 10 days later. CONCLUSIONS The present report underscores the importance of using validated molecular diagnostic tests to identify coinfections in areas where there is a high prevalence of other causes of pneumonia, such as MBT, as a way to improve clinical outcomes in patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is imperative to control the COVID-19 pandemic, the medical community must not forget about the other pandemics to which populations are still prey, and tuberculosis is one of them. We must remain alert to any clinical subtleties so as to ensure timely and accurate diagnosis and stay one step ahead of COVID-19.","Martínez Orozco, José Arturo; Sánchez Tinajero, Ángel; Becerril Vargas, Eduardo; Delgado Cueva, Andrea Iraís; Reséndiz Escobar, Héctor; Vázquez Alcocer, Eduardo; Narváez Díaz, Luis Armando; Ruiz Santillán, Danna Patricia",Am J Case Rep,183,1

Methods: The clinical data of 180 cases of HCC diagnosed by histopathology examination in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from 2012 to 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The factors influencing the development of macrovascular invasion in HCC patients were analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity. Results: Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level was significantly correlated with various clinical characteristics of HCC patients, including the maximum tumor diameter, tumor number, and macrovascular invasion. Further analysis of the risk factors showed that serum direct bilirubin and CRP were independent risk factors for macrovascular invasion in HCC patients, with odds ratios of 1.747 (95% CI 1.119-2.728, P = 0.014) and 2.376 (95% CI 1.495-3.775, P < 0.001). ROC curve analysis showed that serum CRP, direct bilirubin, and the combination of the both had certain diagnostic value for hepatocellular carcinoma combined with macrovascular invasion.

Worldwide, a number of studies were conducted to estimate the magnitude of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. However, there is a need for more robust and well-designed studies to have a relevant public health intervention. Synthesis of the available studies significantly strengthens the quality of evidences for public health practice. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the overall magnitude of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases throughout the course of infection using available evidences. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA checklist to present this study. Two experienced review authors (MA and DBK) were systematically searched international electronic databases for studies. We performed meta-analysis using R statistical software. The overall weighted proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases throughout the course infection was computed. The pooled estimates with 95% confidence intervals were presented using forest plot. Egger's tests were used to assess publication bias, and primary estimates were pooled using a random effects model. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assure the robustness of the result. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies that satisfied the eligibility criteria were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Consequently, in the meta-analysis, a total of 6,071 COVID-19 cases were included. The proportion of asymptomatic infections among the included studies ranged from 1.4% to 78.3%. The findings of this meta-analysis showed that the weighted pooled proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases throughout the course of infection was 25% (95%CI: 16-38). The leave-one out result also revealed that the weighted pooled average of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was between 28% and 31.4%. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, one-fourth of SARS-CoV-2 infections are remained asymptomatic throughout the course infection.

About 7.5 year of waste disposal data at the Regina landfill was collected, verified, and consolidated. Four modeling approaches were examined to predict total waste disposal at the Regina landfill during the COVID-19 period, including (i) continuous total (Baseline), (ii) continuous fraction, (iii) truncated total, and (iv) truncated fraction. A single feature input recurrent neural network model was adopted for each approach. It is hypothesized that waste quantity modeling using different waste fractions and separate time series can better capture disposal behaviors of residents during the lockdown. Compared to the baseline approach, the use of waste fractions in modeling improves both result accuracy and precision. In general, the use of continuous time series over-predicted total waste disposal, especially when actual disposal rates were less than 50 t/day. Compared to the baseline approach, mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean square error (MSE) were reduced. The R value increased from 0.63 to 0.79. Comparing to the baseline, the truncated total and the truncated fraction approaches better captured the total waste disposal behaviors during the COVID-19 period, probably due to the periodicity of the weeklong data set. For both approaches, MAE and MAPE were lower than 70 and 22%, respectively. The model performance of the truncated fraction appears the best, with an MAPE of 19.8% and R value of 0.92. Results suggest the uses of waste fractions and separated time series are beneficial, especially if the input set is heavily skewed.","Vu, Hoang Lan; Ng, Kelvin Tsun Wai; Richter, Amy; Karimi, Nima; Kabir, Golam",Sci Total Environ,183,16

METHOD: Participants in the EAT 2010-2018 (Eating and Activity over Time) study were invited to complete the C-EAT (COVID-19 EAT) survey in April-May 2020. There were 720 respondents to the survey (age: 24.7 ± 2.0 years). Psychological distress, stress, stress management, financial difficulties, and food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic were examined as cross-sectional correlates of disordered eating in 2020. Open-ended questions assessed the perceived impact of the pandemic on eating behaviors. RESULTS: Low stress management was significantly associated with a higher count of extreme unhealthy weight control behaviors (UWCBs). Food insecurity, higher depressive symptoms, and financial difficulties were significantly associated with a higher count of less extreme UWCBs. Higher stress and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with greater odds of binge eating. Six themes pertaining to disordered eating during the pandemic emerged: (a) mindless eating and snacking; (b) increased food consumption; (c) generalized decrease in appetite or dietary intake; (d) eating to cope; (e) pandemic-related reductions in dietary intake; and (f) re-emergence or marked increase in eating disorder symptoms. DISCUSSION: Psychological distress, stress management, financial difficulties, and abrupt schedule changes may have contributed to disordered eating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions that target stress management, depressive symptoms, and financial strain and provide tools to develop a routine may be particularly effective for emerging adults at risk of developing disordered eating during public health crises.","Simone, Melissa; Emery, Rebecca L; Hazzard, Vivienne M; Eisenberg, Marla E; Larson, Nicole; Neumark-Sztainer, Dianne",Int. j. eat. disord,183,1

Migration both within and to Europe has contributed over the past decades to the rise of new religious, racial, ethnic, social, cultural and economic inequality. Such transformations have raised questions about the (multi-level) governance of diversity in Europe, thus determining new challenges for both scholars and policy-makers. Whilst the debate around diversity stemming from migration has become a major topic in urban studies, political science and sociology in Europe, Critical Race Studies and Intersectionality have become central in US approaches to understanding inequality and social injustice. Among the fields where ‘managing diversity’ has become particularly pressing, methodological issues on how to best approach minorities that suffer from multiple discrimination represent some of the hottest subjects of concern. Stemming from the interest in putting into dialogue the existing American scholarship on CRT and anti-discrimination with the European focus on migrant integration, this paper explores the issue of integration in relation to intersectionality by merging the two frames. In doing so, it provides some observations about the complementarity of a racial justice approach for facing the new diversity-related challenges in European polity. In particular, it illustrates how Critical Race Studies can contribute to the analysis of inequality in Europe while drawing on the integration literature.","Magazzini, Tina",Social Sciences,183,1

One common measure taken to contain or reduce diffusion is to detect infected individuals and trace their prior contacts so as to then selectively isolate any individuals likely to have been infected. These prior contacts can be traced using mobile devices such as smartphones or smartwatches, which can continuously collect the location and contacts of their owners by using their embedded localisation and communications technologies, such as GPS, Cellular networks, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of these technologies and determines the impact of contact tracing precision on the spread and control of infectious diseases. To this end, we have created an epidemic model that we used to evaluate the efficiency and cost (number of people quarantined) of the measures to be taken, depending on the smartphone contact tracing technologies used. Our results show that in order to be effective for the COVID-19 disease, the contact tracing technology must be precise, contacts must be traced quickly, and a significant percentage of the population must use the smartphone contact tracing application. These strict requirements make smartphone-based contact tracing rather ineffective at containing the spread of the infection during the first outbreak of the virus. However, considering a second wave, where a portion of the population will have gained immunity, or in combination with some other more lenient measures, smartphone-based contact tracing could be extremely useful.","Hernandez-Orallo, Enrique; Manzoni, Pietro; Calafate, Carlos Tavares; Cano, Juan-Carlos",IEEE Access,183,2

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study of inpatient adults with COVID-19 used multivariable Cox regression to determine the independent effects of DM and obesity on the composite outcome of intubation, intensive care unit admission, or in-hospital mortality. Effect modification between DM and obesity was assessed with a statistical interaction term and an exploration of stratum-specific effects. RESULTS: Out of 3,533 patients, a total of 1,134 (32%) had DM, 1,256 (36%) had obesity, and 430 (12%) had both. DM and obesity were independently associated with the composite outcome (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14 [95% CI: 1.01-1.30] and HR 1.22 [95% CI: 1.05-1.43], respectively). A statistical trend for potential interaction between DM and obesity was observed (P = 0.20). Stratified analyses showed potential increased risk with obesity compared with normal weight among patients with DM (HR 1.34 [95% CI: 1.04-1.74]) and patients without DM (HR 1.18 [95% CI: 0.96-1.43]). CONCLUSIONS: DM and obesity are independent risk factors associated with COVID-19 severity. Stratified analyses suggest that obesity may confer greater risk to patients with DM compared with patients without DM, and this relationship requires further exploration.","Tchang, Beverly G; Askin, Gulce; Sahagun, Ageline; Hwang, Jonathan; Huang, Hao; Mendelsohn Curanaj, Felicia A; Seley, Jane J; Safford, Monika M; Alonso, Laura C; Aronne, Louis J; Shukla, Alpana P",Obesity (Silver Spring),183,16

The results corroborate earlier published results for non-transparent masks, but transparent options have greater attenuation, resonant peaks, and deflect sounds in ways that non-transparent masks do not. Although transparent face coverings have poorer acoustic performance, the presence of visual cues remains important for both verbal and non-verbal communication.

To date, more than 95.4 million have been infected and more than two million deaths have been officially reported by the WHO. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a key role in the disease pathogenesis. In this computational study, seventeen coding variants were found to be important for ACE2 binding with the coronavirus spike protein. The frequencies of these allele variants range from 3.88 × 10-3 to 5.47 × 10-6 for rs4646116 (K26R) and rs1238146879 (P426A), respectively. Chloroquine (CQ) and its metabolite hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are mainly used to prevent and treat malaria and rheumatic diseases. They are also used in several countries to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection inducing COVID-19. Both CQ and HCQ were found to interact differently with the various ACE2 domains reported to bind with coronavirus spike protein. A molecular docking approach revealed that intermolecular interactions of both CQ and HCQ exhibited mediation by ACE2 polymorphism. Further explorations of the relationship and the interactions between ACE2 polymorphism and CQ/HCQ would certainly help to better understand the COVID-19 management strategies, particularly their use in the absence of specific vaccines or drugs.","Badraoui, Riadh; Adnan, Mohd; Bardakci, Fevzi; Alreshidi, Mousa M",Molecules (Basel),183,1

The flexible design of LHCII underlies a photoprotective mechanism whereby this complex switches to a dissipative state in response to high light stress, allowing the rapid dissipation of excess excitation energy (non-photochemical quenching, NPQ). In this work, we locked single LHCII trimers in a quenched conformation after immobilization of the complexes in polyacrylamide gels to impede protein interactions. A comparison of their pigment excited-state dynamics with quenched LHCII aggregates in buffer revealed the presence of a new spectral band at 515 nm arising after chlorophyll excitation. This is suggested to be the signature of a carotenoid excited state, linked to the quenching of chlorophyll singlet excited states. Our data highlight the marked sensitivity of pigment excited-state dynamics in LHCII to structural changes induced by the environment.","Saccon, Francesco; Durchan, Milan; Bína, David; Duffy, Christopher D P; Ruban, Alexander V; Polívka, Tomás",iScience,183,16

The memorizing-forgetting behavior is achieved based on fast water uptake and slow water release upon thermal stimulus, as well as thermal-history-dependent transparency change of these gels. The forgetting time is proportional to the thermal learning time, in analogy to the behavior of brain. The memory is stable against temperature fluctuation and large stretching; moreover, the forgetting process is programmable.

A total of 40 serum samples of SARS-CoV2 patients were purchased from RayBiotech. A total of 50 pre-pandemic human serum samples from San Diego Blood Bank were used as negative controls. After performing the one-step quick test of these 90 serum samples, I found that 39 samples are positive for anti-scN antibodies. All of the 39 positives are from the 40 SARS-CoV2 patients, suggesting that the one-step test is more sensitive than the lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), the most widely used rapid antibody test. None of the 50 pre-pandemic samples is positive for anti-scN antibodies, indicating that the one-step test has an excellent specificity. The one-step test takes only ~5 min to detect the antibodies;and 1 ml of Escherichia coli culture can produce reagent proteins sufficient for thousands of the tests. Since the one-step test does not need a secondary antibody, it can be used as a universal test for anti-scN antibodies across different mammalian species to track down both human infection and the animal reservoir of SARS-CoV2 virus.","Zhou, Xianjin",PeerJ,183,16

The shortage of complete genomic sequences available impairs our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 introduction and establishment in the country. To better understand its dynamics in Italy, we analyzed complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates, obtained directly from clinical samples.

Here, the hematological characteristics of patients with severe and critical 2019-nCoV pneumonia in intensive care unit (ICU) were investigated, which may provide the necessary basis for its diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: We collected data on patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV pneumonia in the ICU of Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan from February 25 to April 2, 2020. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm the presence of 2019-nCoV, and various hematological characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: All patients tested positive for 2019-nCoV using nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum after admission, and interstitial pneumonia findings were noted on chest computed tomography. Sex, age and comorbidities were not significantly different between the severe and critical groups. In terms of prognosis, the survival rate of patients in the severe group reached 100%, whereas that of patients in the critical group was only 13.33% after positive treatment. Furthermore, lymphocyte percentage, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, D-dimer, myohemoglobin, procalcitonin, and IL-6 levels were high-risk factors for disease progression in critical patients. Finally, lymphocyte percentage and blood urea nitrogen, calcium, myohemoglobin, and IL-6 levels were closely associated with patient prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: 2019-nCoV pneumonia should be considered a systemic disease. Patients with more complications were more likely to develop critical disease. Lymphocyte percentage and blood urea nitrogen, calcium, myohemoglobin, and IL-6 levels can be monitored to prevent progression critical disease.","Du, Yong; Lu, Zhanjun; Jin, Jing; Shi, Tianyun; Ding, Yi; Qian, Ling; He, Wei; Huang, Qihui; Feng, Jingjing; Jiang, Rong; Chen, Xuru; Jiang, Handong; Jie, Zhijun",Int Immunopharmacol,183,1

Developing vaccines would need a good knowledge of genetic properties of SARS-CoV-2. The most fundamental approach is to look into the structures of its RNA, in particular, the nucleotides and amino acids. This motivates our research on this topic. We study the occurrence structures of nitrogenous bases and amino acids. To this aim, we devise a structural metric which could measure the structure differences for bases or amino acids. By analyzing various SARS-CoV-2 samples, we calculate the distance matrices for nitrogenous bases and amino acids. Based on the distance matrices, we find the average distance matrices for them, respectively. Then we identify the relations of all the minimal distances between bases and amino acids. The results also show that different substructures would yield much more diversified distances between amino acids. In the end, we also conduct the comparison of our structural metric with other frequently used metrics, in particular, Hausdorff metrics.","Chen, Ray-Ming",J Bioinform Comput Biol,183,32

Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic with an increasing incidence in several countries. Speed and accuracy of diagnosis are needed to prevent worsening of patient's condition. Real-Time Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is still a gold standard of COVID-19 diagnosis, however, this test shown false negative results in several case. Radiological examinations, chest X-Ray (CXR) and CT scan, are used to support the diagnosis. The most commonly found in CXR are consolidation, ground-glass opacity (GGO), bilateral distribution, peripheral and in the lower lobe, but this examination is insensitive to find lung abnormalities in early stages of disease. However, CXR can be used to monitor the development of lung abnormalities due to COVID-19, such as the Brixia Score method. On the other hand, CT-Scan is more sensitive than CXR and able to show early lung abnormalities in negative RT-PCR results. CT scan show the presence of GGO, consolidation, crazy-paving stone, and air bronchogram. CT-scanning can reduce the false-negative rate on RT-PCR and become a screening tool in suspected COVID-19 patients at epidemic area where RT-PCR is not available. The use of radiological examinations and RT-PCR can save the time and help in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19.Keywords: COVID-19’s Radiology, Imaging of SARS-CoV-2","Yanti, Budi; Hayatun, Ulfa",Jurnal Kedokteran Syiah Kuala,183,15

It might be involved in the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure leading to death. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the immune-inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19, then determine optimal thresholds for assessing severe and fatal forms of this disease.153 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study, and classified into non-severe and severe groups. Plasmatic levels of interleukin 6 (IL6), C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble-IL2 receptor (IL2R&#945;), procalcitonin (PCT) and ferritin were measured using chemiluminescence assay. Complete blood count was performed by Convergys 3X® hematology analyzer. Our results demonstrated that the peripheral blood levels of IL6, PCT, CRP, ferritin, IL2R&#945;, white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEU), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (d-NLR) were significantly higher in severe forms of COVID-19. The ROC curve analysis showed that IL6 was the most accurate inflammatory biomarker. The calculated cutoff of IL6 (42 pg/ml) could correctly classify > 90% of patients regarding their risk of severity (area under ROC curve (AUROC) = 0.972) and the threshold value of 83 pg/ml was highly predictive of the progression to death (AUROC = 0.94, OR = 184) after a median of 3 days. Besides, IL-6 was positively correlated with other inflammatory markers and the kinetic analysis highlighted its value for monitoring COVID-19 patients. PCT and NLR had also a high prognostic relevance to assess severe forms of COVID-19 with corresponding AUROC of 0.856, 0.831 respectively. Furthermore the cut-off values of PCT (0.16 ng/ml) and NLR (7.4) allowed to predict mortality with high accuracy (se = 96.3%, sp = 70.5%,OR = 61.2)' (se = 75%, sp = 84%, OR = 14.6).The levels of these parameters were not influenced by corticosteroid treatment, which make them potential prognostic markers when patients are already undergoing steroid therapy.","Sayah, Wafa; Berkane, Ismahane; Guermache, Imène; Sabri, Mohamed; Lakhal, Fatma Zahra; Yasmine Rahali, Sarah; Djidjeli, Asma; Lamara Mahammed, Lydia; Merah, Fatma; Belaid, Brahim; Berkani, Lilya; Lazli, Nouzha Zhor; Kheddouci, Lylia; Kadi, Ahmed; Ouali, Mourad; Khellafi, Rachida; Mekideche, Dalila; Kheliouen, Assia; Hamidi, Réda Malek; Ayoub, Soraya; Raaf, Nabil Beramtane; Derrar, Fawzi; Gharnaout, Merzak; Allam, Ines; Djidjik, Réda",Cytokine,183,5

Methods: The clinical and CT data of 16 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Dynamic CTs were performed continuously after admission. Results: Of the patients, 14 were moderate cases, and 2 were severe. Twelve patients underwent CT at the early onset stage. Single nodules or ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were found in 2 patients and multiple bilateral pulmonary lesions in 8 (consolidation-like opacities with or without small nodules in five and large GGOs with interlobular septal thickening in three). Ten had lesion growth and enlargement on the second CT. Fourteen patients underwent CT during the progressive stage, which revealed GGOs and focal consolidation in 6 of them, lung consolidation opacities in 5, and simple, large GGOs with interlobular septal thickening in 3.

This mixed-method study investigated officers' strain over three months after the lockdown. Methods: In an online survey, 2567 police officers (77% male) from Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Spain participated at three measurement points per country in spring, 2020. Three-level growth curve models assessed changes in strain and its relation to stressor appraisal, emotion regulation, and preparedness through training. To add context to the findings, free response answers about officers' main tasks, stressors, and crisis measures were coded inductively. Results: On average, officers seemed to tolerate the pandemic with slight decreases in strain over time. Despite substantial variance between countries, 66% of the variance occurred between individuals. Sex, work experience, stressor appraisal, emotion regulation, and preparedness significantly predicted strain. Risk of infection and deficient communication emerged as main stressors. Officers' reports allowed to derive implications for governmental, organizational, and individual coping strategies during pandemics. Conclusion: Preparing for a pandemic requires three primary paths: 1) enacting unambiguous laws and increasing public compliance through media communication, 2) being logistically prepared, and 3) improving stress regulation skills in police training.","Frenkel, Marie Ottilie; Giessing, Laura; Egger-Lampl, Sebastian; Hutter, Vana; Oudejans, Raoul; Kleygrewe, Lisanne; Jaspaert, Emma; Plessner, Henning",J Crim Justice,183,20

Systemic solutions require changes in the habits of virtue, and this study focuses on the habit of generosity. Building on the work of Stephan Joubert’s Paul as Benefactor , this study concentrates on Paul’s collection in one notable instance: what he says about generosity in 2 Corinthians 8-9 and, in particular, what he means by isotēs in 2 Cor 8:13–15. Does it mean “equality” or “equity”? Beginning with a reinvigorated interest in the economic vision of the apostle Paul about what is meant by “weak” and “good works” and what the Pastoral Epistles communicate with eusebeia (not “godliness” but “social respectability and civility”), we reconsider the collection as an act on the part of the Pauline mission churches to express more than ecclesial unity. This act embodied a theology of grace in mutual reciprocity and in equitable provision on the part of the wealthy for the poor, not least and not limited to those in their own Christian assemblies. The term isotēs is too easily glossed over when translated as “fair balance”, “fairness”, and so the translation of the term with “equity” or “equality” comes closest to the vision of the apostle. Too few studies on this term baptize it sufficiently in the economics of the ancient world and the early Christian radical vision of siblingship and family. Contribution: From the perspective of the Historical Thought and Source Interpretation of the work of Paul, the question of systemic equality or equity is as crucial to navigating the current economic climate as it has ever been. Equality or equity is not limited to Christian communities but following the early church in embodying a theology of grace.","McKnight, Scot",Hervormde Teologiese Studies,183,10

Chest x-ray can be used in diagnosis and follow up in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The study aims at describing the chest x-ray findings and temporal radiographic changes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: From March 15 to April 20, 2020 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 were retrospectively studied. Patients' demographics, clinical characteristics, and chest x-ray findings were reported. Radiographic findings were correlated with the course of the illness and patients' symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 88 patients (50 (56.8%) females and 38 (43.2%) males) were admitted to the hospital with confirmed COVID-19. Their age ranged from 3 to 80 years (35.2 ± 18.2 years). 48/88 (45%) were symptomatic, only 13/88 (45.5%) showed abnormal chest x-ray findings. A total of 190 chest x-rays were obtained for the 88 patients with a total of 59/190 (31%) abnormal chest x-rays. The most common finding on chest x-rays was peripheral ground glass opacities (GGO) affecting the lower lobes. In the course of illness, the GGO progressed into consolidations peaking around 6-11 days (GGO 70%, consolidations 30%). The consolidations regressed into GGO towards the later phase of the illness at 12-17 days (GGO 80%, consolidations 10%). There was increase in the frequency of normal chest x-rays from 9% at days 6-11 up to 33% after 18 days indicating a healing phase. The majority (12/13, 92.3%) of patients with abnormal chest x-rays were symptomatic (P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Almost half of patients with COVID-19 have abnormal chest x-ray findings with peripheral GGO affecting the lower lobes being the most common finding. Chest x-ray can be used in diagnosis and follow up in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Rousan, Liqa A; Elobeid, Eyhab; Karrar, Musaab; Khader, Yousef",BMC Pulm Med,183,26

OBJECTIVE: To examine manual ventilation performance among respiratory therapists (RTs) in a simulation model. METHODS: Respiratory therapists (n=98) were instructed to ventilate a manikin for 18 breaths. Linear regression was utilized to determine associated predictors with the outcomes: delivered tidal volume, pressure and flow rate. RESULTS: Among all participants, the mean ventilation parameters include a tidal volume of 599.70 ml, peak pressure of 26.35 cmH2O, and flow rate of 77.20 l/min. Higher confidence values were positively associated with delivered peak pressure (p=0.01) and flow rate (p=0.008). Those with the most confidence in using the BVM actually delivered higher peak pressures and flow rates compared to those with lower confidence levels.

As temperature inversion altitude increases, the pollutants are dispersed in a greater thickness of the atmosphere and the concentration of the pollutants decreases on the earth's surface. At the same time, the number of patients with Covid-19 reduces. Although investigation of the effect of severity of pollutants on the number of coronavirus patients showed poor significance level during the periods, a decreasing and increasing relationship was shown. in 1- and 9–14-day periods, the correlation coefficient was negative. As a result, the effect of the severity of pollutants and Covid-19 is not observed on 1- and9–14-day periods. Conversely, during2–8-day periods, a positive correlation coefficient was observed. Therefore, the time between infection with the virus and the onset of symptoms of this disease is between 2 and 8 days, in which the 3-day period showed the highest correlation. Considering the relationship between inversion altitude, the severity of pollutants and the number of patients during 2–5-day periods, it can be concluded that in the metropolitan city of Tehran, the maximum infection of this virus and the onset of symptoms is between 2 and 5 days.","Keikhosravi, Ghasem Fadavi Seyedeh Fatemeh",Urban Climate,183,8

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 24th, 2020 and March 5th, 2020, 103 patients were studied. Among these, 32 were patients in the isolation ward of the Infectious Disease Department in Baoding Second Hospital with suspected 2019-nCoV, and 71 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV were in the Tangshan Infectious Disease Hospital. Of the 103 patients included, 97 cases were observed in isolation. Using a self-control study design, each patient's anxiety was scored on a self-rating anxiety scale before receiving the psychological intervention (on the 7th day of isolation) and after receiving the intervention (on the 14th day of isolation). The severity of anxiety was evaluated based on the anxiety score before receiving the intervention. The anxiety scores before and after receiving the intervention were then compared using the paired t-test, and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: After receiving the psychological intervention once or twice a week, the anxiety of the patients improved significantly after one week. CONCLUSIONS: The anxiety of patients with 2019-nCoV in isolation wards can be alleviated through psychological intervention. By alleviating patient anxiety, this intervention also helps patients maintain their psychological wellbeing, which promotes rehabilitation and helps with the control of 2019-nCoV.","Sun, P; Fan, D-J; He, T; Li, H-Z; Wang, G; Zhang, X-Z; Wu, Y-Q; Dai, Y-H",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,183,24

Here we assessed the suitability of using 100-well BioScreen plates or 96-well plates incubated in a robot hotel to cultivate eight filamentous marine fungi, six sporulating and two non-sporulating, to obtain data on growth and substrate (glucose, xylose, galactose or glycerol) utilisation in a high throughput manner. All eight fungi grew in both cultivation systems, but growth was more variable and with more noise in the data in the Cytomat plate hotel than in the BioScreen. Specific growth rates between 0.01 (no added substrate) and 0.07 h-1 were measured for strains growing in the BioScreen and between 0.01 and 0.27 h-1 for strains in the plate hotel. Three strains, Dendryphiella salina LF304, Penicillium chrysogenum KF657 and Penicillium pinophilum LF458, consistently had higher specific growth rates on glucose and xylose in the plate hotel than in the BioScreen, but otherwise results were similar in the two systems. However, because of the noise in data from the plate hotel, the data obtained from it could only be used to distinguish between substrates which did or did not support growth, whereas data from BioScreen also provided information on substrate preference. Glucose was the preferred substrate for all strains, followed by xylose and galactose. Five strains also grew on glycerol. Therefore it was important to minimise the amount of glycerol introduced with the inoculum to avoid misinterpreting the results for growth on poor substrates. We concluded that both systems could provide physiological data with filamentous fungi, provided sufficient replicates are included in the measurements.","Tamminen, Anu; Happonen, Petrus; Barth, Dorothee; Holmström, Sami; Wiebe, Marilyn G",PLoS One,183,1

The recent COVID-19 global pandemic has made wildlife consumption an issue that concerns everyone around the world. Formerly obscure practices like wet markets and commodities like pangolin scales or bear bile have gained international notoriety. Along with that attention has come increasing politicization and ideological polarization. Beyond the global fight against the pandemic, there has been another global struggle over the meaning and origin of the disease, as evidenced by the spread of terms like “Wuhan Flu” and “bat soup.” What has become obscured by the news cycle struggling to keep up with the rapid spread of the virus and the political sound and fury surrounding it is any meaningful understanding of China's wildlife consumption and trade. Deeply ingrained in Chinese culture and history, the wildlife trade is not going away anytime soon. Despite a national ban, already wet markets are returning across China. Addressing the wildlife trade in China, we argue, requires first understanding it.","Zhu, Annah; Zhu, George",World Dev.,183,8

Evidence From Time-Frequency Domain With Portfolio Implications,16.29237,3.1197376,2021,"BACKGROUND: Italy has been one of the most affected countries in the world by COVID-19. There has been increasing concern regarding the impact of COVID-19 on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in patients treated with immunosuppressants or biologics. The aim of our study is to understand the incidence of COVID-19 in a large cohort of patients with IBD. Furthermore, we analyzed possible risk factors for infection and severity of COVID-19. METHODS: This was an observational study evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on IBD patients in a single tertiary center. A 23 multiple-choice-question anonymous survey was administered to 1200 patients with IBD between March 10th and June 10th 2020. RESULTS: 1158 questionnaires were analyzed. The majority of patients had Crohn's disease (CD) (60%) and most of them were in clinical remission. Among the 26 patients (2.2%) who tested positive for COVID-19, only 5 (3CD) were on biological treatment and none required hospitalization. Two patients died and were on treatment with mesalazine only. Of the 1158 patients, 521 were on biological therapy, which was discontinued in 85 (16.3%) and delayed in 195 patients (37.4%). A worsening of IBD symptoms was observed in 200 patients on biological therapy (38.4%). Most of these patients, 189 (94.5%), had stopped or delayed biological treatment, while 11 (5.5%) had continued their therapy regularly (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data are in line with the current literature and confirm a higher incidence compared to the general population. Biological therapy for IBD seems to not be a risk factor for infection and should not be discontinued in order to avoid IBD relapse.","Rizzello, Fernando; Calabrese, Carlo; Salice, Marco; Calandrini, Lucia; Privitera, Hana; Melotti, Laura; Peruzzi, Giulia; Dussias, Nikolas; Belluzzi, Andrea; Scaioli, Eleonora; Decorato, Anastasio; Siniscalchi, Antonio; Filippone, Eleonora; Laureti, Silvio; Rottoli, Matteo; Poggioli, Gilberto; Gionchetti, Paolo",Dig. liver dis,183,6

Moreover, an increasing number of COVID-19 patients have been noted to experience hepatic and pancreatic injury. In this study, we retrospectively investigated symptoms and laboratory findings related to the GI system in a single center in Athens, Greece, and assessed the role of these parameters in relation to survival and disease severity. Method We retrospectively studied 61 adult COVID-19 patients admitted to the Army Share Fund Hospital (NIMTS) in Athens, Greece, from April 6th to May 6 th, 2020. Results Sixty-one COVID-19 cases were assessed in the study period. Regarding both survival and disease severity, diarrhea was the most common finding. The multivariate analysis revealed that elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase levels and low serum albumin levels were associated with worse patient survival (odds ratio [OR] 1.029, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.007-1.05, P=0.0088; and OR 0.219, 95%CI 0.066-0.723, P=0.0127, respectively). As far as disease severity is concerned, only a low serum albumin level (measured at hospital admission) was correlated with more severe disease (OR 0.025, 95%CI 0.004-0.161, P=0.0001). Conclusions Outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms should be considered for COVID-19 testing in a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, as these symptoms are observed more and more in clinical settings. As prospective studies begin to emerge, clinicians will have more robust research data to diagnose COVID-19 patients earlier and identify patients in need of more intensive treatment.","Tsibouris, Panagiotis; Ekmektzoglou, Konstantinos; Agorogianni, Alexandra; Kalantzis, Chrysostomos; Theofanopoulou, Antonia; Toumbelis, Klearchos; Petrogiannopoulos, Leonidas; Poutakidis, Charalambos; Goggaki, Stavroula; Braimakis, Ioannis; Vlachou, Erasmia; Pouliakis, Abraham; Apostolopoulos, Periklis",Ann.

Remote working has become the 'new normal' for many organizations, engendering further challenges for employees, who have started experiencing anxiety, technostress caused by digitalization and lack of social interaction, frustration, occupational burden, counterproductive work behavior, exhaustion, burnout, depersonalization, and increased turnover intention. All these factors, corroborated by prolonged restrictions, have contributed to a decrease in employee satisfaction, diminishing performance and generating a counterproductive behavior. Based on Social Exchange Theory, this research plans to investigate the influence of internal marketing on job satisfaction, task performance, and counterproductive work behavior in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in an emerging market, namely Romania. Based on a quantitative research study among 850 employees, we show that internal marketing strongly and significantly impacts job satisfaction, while insignificantly impacting task performance and counterproductive work behavior. Job satisfaction actuates task performance in a significant and positive manner, contributing to a reduction in counterproductive work behaviors. This paper highlights the effects of internal marketing orientation on job satisfaction, and the effects of job satisfaction on job performance and counterproductive work behaviors.","Nemteanu, M.

Relative of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, has genomic organization, which is very similar. In this article, the function and structure of the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are described in great detail. The nsps are expressed as a single or two polyproteins, which are then cleaved into individual proteins using two proteases of the virus, a chymotrypsin-like protease and a papain-like protease. The released proteins serve as centers of virus replication and transcription. Some of these nsps modulate the host's translation and immune systems, while others help the virus evade the host immune system. Some of the nsps help form replication-transcription complex at double-membrane vesicles. Others, including one RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and one exonuclease, help in the polymerization of newly synthesized RNA of the virus and help minimize the mutation rate by proofreading. After synthesis of the viral RNA, it gets capped. The capping consists of adding GMP and a methylation mark, called cap 0 and additionally adding a methyl group to the terminal ribose called cap1. Capping is accomplished with the help of a helicase, which also helps remove a phosphate, two methyltransferases, and a scaffolding factor. Among the structural proteins, S protein forms the receptor of the virus, which latches on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor of the host and N protein binds and protects the genomic RNA of the virus. The accessory proteins found in these viruses are small proteins with immune modulatory roles. Besides functions of these proteins, solved X-ray and cryogenic electron microscopy structures related to the function of the proteins along with comparisons to other coronavirus homologs have been described in the article. Finally, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 residues of the proteome during the 2020 pandemic has been described. Some proteins are mutated more often than other proteins, but the significance of these mutation rates is not fully understood.

Prior phase I trials (non COVID-19) demonstrated improvement in pulmonary function in ARDS patients using fibrinolytic therapy. A follow-up trial using the widely available tissue-plasminogen activator (alteplase) is now needed to assess optimal dosing and safety in this critically ill patient population. Objective: To describe the design and rationale of a Phase IIa trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of alteplase treatment for moderate/severe COVID-19-induced ARDS. Patients/Methods: A rapidly adaptive, pragmatic, open label, randomized, controlled, phase IIa clinical trial will be conducted with three groups: intravenous(IV) alteplase 50mg, IV alteplase 100mg, and control (standard-of-care). Inclusion criteria are known/suspected COVID-19 infection with PaO2/FiO2 ratio<150mmHg for >4 hours despite maximal mechanical ventilation management. Alteplase will be delivered through an initial bolus of 50mg or 100mg followed by heparin infusion for systemic anticoagulation, with alteplase re-dosing if there is a >20% PaO2/FiO2 improvement not sustained by 24 hours. Results: The primary outcome is improvement in PaO2/FiO2 at 48 hours post-randomization. Other outcomes include: ventilator- and ICU-free-days, successful extubation (no reintubation &#8804;3 days after initial extubation), and mortality. Fifity eligible patients will be enrolled in a rapidly adaptive, modified stepped-wedge design with four looks at the data. Conclusion: Findings will provide timely information on the safety, efficacy and optimal dosing of tPA to treat moderate/severe COVID-19-induced ARDS, which can be rapidly adapted to a phase III trial.

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) inhibitors may increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is the receptor for SARSCoV-2 Spike protein. The consequences of using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) during the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study aiming to identify the odds of severe disease (defined as either hospitalization of &#8805;14 days, admission to the intensive care unit, or death) associated with exposure to ACEi or ARB was conducted. Adult patients (age &#8805;18 years) with COVID-19 admitted to the Istanbul Faculty of Medicine Corona Center between March 9 and May 11, 2020, were included. Chronic users of ACEi, ARB, or other antihypertensive drugs were matched according to age, sex, sick days before hospitalization, comorbidities, smoking, number of antihypertensive regimens, doxazosin use, furosemide use, and serum creatinine level. Odds ratios (OR) of having severe disease were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 611 patients were admitted with COVID-19, confirmed by either reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or computed tomography (CT). There were 363 males, and the age ranged from 18 to 98 years, with an average age of 57±15 years. Of these, 165 participants had severe disease (53 deaths, case fatality rate: 8.7%). Among those with hypertension (n=249), ARB exposure was compatible with decreased odds (OR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.27-1.36, p=0.31) of severe disease though not statistically significant, while ACEi exposure significantly reduced the risk of severe disease (OR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.15-0.87, p=0.03). ACEi exposure was associated with milder infiltrations seen on baseline CT, lower C-reactive protein and ferritin, higher monocytes, shorter hospitalization, and less requirement for specific empirical treatments (favipiravir and meropenem). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that exposure to ACEi drugs may have favorable effects in the context of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Senkal, Naci; Meral, Rasimcan; Medetalibeyoglu, Alpay; Konyaoglu, Hilal; Kose, Murat; Tukek, Tufan",Anatol J Cardiol,183,1

514965,514965,514965,Blindsight ethnography and exceptional moments,16.285906,3.580803,2020,"Background: Severe COVID-19 is characterised by inflammation and coagulation in the presence of complement system activation. We aimed to explore the potential benefit and safety of selectively blocking the anaphylatoxin and complement protein C5a with the monoclonal antibody IFX-1 (vilobelimab), in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: We did an exploratory, open-label, randomised phase 2 trial (part of the adaptive phase 2/3 PANAMO trial) of intravenous IFX-1 in adults with severe COVID-19 at three academic hospitals in the Netherlands. Eligibility criteria were age 18 years or older; severe pneumonia with pulmonary infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, a clinical history of severe shortness of breath within the past 14 days, or a need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation; severe disease defined as a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (PaO2/FiO2) between 100 mm Hg and 250 mm Hg in the supine position; and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive IFX-1 (up to seven doses of 800 mg intravenously) plus best supportive care (IFX-1 group) or best supportive care only (control group). The primary outcome was the percentage change in PaO2/FiO2 in the supine position between baseline and day 5. Mortality at 28 days and treatment-emergent and serious adverse events were key secondary outcomes. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in all patients according to treatment received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04333420). Findings: Between March 31 and April 24, 2020, 30 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the IFX-1 group (n=15) or the control group (n=15). During the study it became clear that several patients could not be assessed regularly in the supine position because of severe hypoxaemia. It was therefore decided to focus on all PaO2/FiO2 assessments (irrespective of position). At day 5 after randomisation, the mean PaO2/FiO2 (irrespective of position) was 158 mm Hg (SD 63; range 84-265) in the IFX-1 group and 189 mm Hg (89; 71-329) in the control group. Analyses of the least squares mean relative change in PaO2/FiO2 at day 5 showed no differences between treatment groups (17% change in the IFX-1 group vs 41% in the control group; difference -24% [95% CI -58 to 9], p=0·15. Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality by 28 days were 13% (95% CI 0-31) for the IFX-1 group and 27% (4-49) for the control group (adjusted hazard ratio for death 0·65 [95% CI 0·10-4·14]). The frequency of serious adverse events were similar between groups (nine [60%] in the IFX-1 group vs seven [47%] in the control group) and no deaths were considered related to treatment assignment. However, a smaller proportion of patients had pulmonary embolisms classed as serious in the IFX-1 group (two [13%]) than in the control group (six [40%]). Infections classed as serious were reported in three (20%) patients in the IFX-1 group versus five (33%) patients in the control group. Interpretation: In this small exploratory phase 2 part of the PANAMO trial, C5a inhibition with IFX-1 appears to be safe in patients with severe COVID-19. The secondary outcome results in favour of IFX-1 are preliminary because the study was not powered on these endpoints, but they support the investigation of C5a inhibition with IFX-1 in a phase 3 trial using 28-day mortality as the primary endpoint.

Yet, to date, there is no evidence of this disproportionate impact on non-national individuals, including economic migrants, short-term travellers and refugees. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Italian surveillance system of all COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed cases tested positive from the beginning of the outbreak (20th of February) to the 19th of July 2020. We used multilevel negative-binomial regression models to compare the case fatality and the rate of admission to hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) between Italian and non-Italian nationals. The analysis was adjusted for differences in demographic characteristics, pre-existing comorbidities, and period of diagnosis. RESULTS: We analyzed 213 180 COVID-19 cases, including 15 974 (7.5%) non-Italian nationals. We found that, compared to Italian cases, non-Italian cases were diagnosed at a later date and were more likely to be hospitalized {[adjusted rate ratio (ARR)=1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33-1.44]} and admitted to ICU (ARR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.07-1.32), with differences being more pronounced in those coming from countries with lower human development index (HDI). We also observed an increased risk of death in non-Italian cases from low-HDI countries (ARR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.01-1.75). CONCLUSIONS: A delayed diagnosis in non-Italian cases could explain their worse outcomes compared to Italian cases. Ensuring early access to diagnosis and treatment to non-Italians could facilitate the control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and improve health outcomes in all people living in Italy, regardless of nationality.","Fabiani, Massimo; Mateo-Urdiales, Alberto; Andrianou, Xanthi; Bella, Antonino; Del Manso, Martina; Bellino, Stefania; Rota, Maria C; Boros, Stefano; Vescio, Maria F; D039,; Ancona, Fortunato P; Siddu, Andrea; Punzo, Ornella; Filia, Antonietta; Brusaferro, Silvio; Rezza, Giovanni; Dente, Maria G; Declich, Silvia; Pezzotti, Patrizio; Riccardo, Flavia",Eur J Public Health,183,1

Retrospective at the time of COVID-19],16.151283,3.2665884,2020,"The unique cytokine signature of COVID-19 might provide clues to disease mechanisms and possible future therapies. Here, we propose a pathogenic model in which the alarmin cytokine, interleukin (IL)-33, is a key player in driving all stages of COVID-19 disease (ie, asymptomatic, mild-moderate, severe-critical, and chronic-fibrotic). In susceptible individuals, IL-33 release by damaged lower respiratory cells might induce dysregulated GATA-binding factor 3-expressing regulatory T cells, thereby breaking immune tolerance and eliciting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-induced autoinflammatory lung disease. Such disease might be initially sustained by IL-33-differentiated type-2 innate lymphoid cells and locally expanded Î³Î´ T cells. In severe COVID-19 cases, the IL-33-ST2 axis might act to expand the number of pathogenic granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-expressing T cells, dampen antiviral interferon responses, elicit hyperinflammation, and favour thromboses. In patients who survive severe COVID-19, IL-33 might drive pulmonary fibrosis by inducing myofibroblasts and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We discuss the therapeutic implications of these hypothetical pathways, including use of therapies that target IL-33 (eg, anti-ST2), T helper 17-like Î³Î´ T cells, immune cell homing, and cytokine balance.","Zizzo, Gaetano; Cohen, Philip L",,183,16

S. aureus was detected more frequently in tampons that did not require an applicator for their insertion (74/233 [32%] versus 90/381 [24%]; OR=1.51 [95% CI 1.04-2.17]) and in women who used an intrauterine device for contraception (53/155 [34%] versus 145/572 [27%]; OR =1.53 [95% CI 1.05-2.24]). The S. aureus strains isolated from tampons belonged to 22 different clonal complexes (CCs). The most prevalent CC was CC398 agr1 (n=57, 27%), a clone that does not produce superantigenic toxins, followed by CC30 agr 3 (n=27, 13%) producing TSST-1 (24/27 [89%]), the principal clone of S. aureus involved in menstrual toxic shock syndrome.IMPORTANCE Menstrual toxic shock syndrome (MTSS) is an uncommon severe acute disease that occurs in healthy menstruating women colonized by TSST-1-producing S. aureus who use intravaginal protection, such as tampons and menstrual cups. The catamenial product collected by the protection serves as a growth medium for S. aureus and allows TSST-1 production. Previous studies evaluated the prevalence of genital colonization by S. aureus by vaginal swabbing, but they did not examine tampon colonization. This study demonstrates a high prevalence of tampon colonization by S. aureus, and the presence of the CC30 TSST-1 S. aureus clone responsible for MTSS in tampons from healthy women. The results support the vaginal carriage of this lineage in healthy women. In addition, the higher prevalence of S. aureus within tampons that do not require an applicator indicates a crucial role of hand-washing before tampon handling to decrease the risk of tampon contamination.","Chiaruzzi, Myriam; Barbry, Alexia; Muggeo, Anaëlle; Tristan, Anne; Jacquemond, Isaline; Badiou, Cedric; Cluzeau, Laurence; Bourdeau, Sabine; Durand, Thibaut; Engelmann, Astrid; Bosquet, Dorian; Bes, Michèle; Prigent-Combaret, Claire; Thioulouse, Jean; Muller, Daniel; Lina, Gérard",,183,33

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of MDR-TB patients was conducted, with positive cultures collected from cases at 13 sites. Patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial infection during anti-TB therapy were excluded. BDQ minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using a 7H9 Middlebrook broth-based microdilution method. Mutations conferring BDQ resistance were detected via Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: 277 patients receiving BDQ treatment were studied, with BDQ resistance noted in isolates from 2.2% (6/277) of MDR-TB cases, sputum conversion observed in 5 cases, and culture conversion observed in 138 cases within 2 weeks. Another 15 and 30 isolates were excluded from final analysis due to failures in obtaining subcultures and serial isolates, respectively. Of 94 cases yielding serial isolates, 11 exhibited reduced BDQ susceptibility, while 3 of 5 cases with acquired resistance failed to culture convert. Sequence analysis revealed that 6 of 11 BDQ-resistant isolates harbored Rv0678 mutations; no mutations were detected in three other BDQ resistance-associated genes. No significant intergroup difference in culture conversion time was observed. CONCLUSIONS: MDR-TB patients in China exhibited a low initial BDQ resistance rate. MDR-TB cases with acquired BDQ resistance were at greater risk of treatment failure relative to initially BDQ-resistant cases. Rv0678 mutations accounted for BDQ resistance in this cohort.","Liu, Yuhong; Gao, Mengqiu; Du, Jian; Wang, Lu; Gao, Jingtao; Shu, Wei; Wang, Yufeng; Xue, Zhongtan; Li, Liang; Pang, Yu",,183,16

One age-associated defect in human T cells is the reduced expression of miR-181a. miR-181ab1 deficiency in peripheral murine T cells causes delayed viral clearance after infection, resembling human immune aging. Here we show that naive T cells from older individuals as well as miR-181ab1-deficient murine T cells develop excessive replication stress after activation, due to reduced histone expression and delayed S-phase cell cycle progression. Reduced histone expression was caused by the miR-181a target SIRT1 that directly repressed transcription of histone genes by binding to their promoters and reducing histone acetylation. Inhibition of SIRT1 activity or SIRT1 silencing increased histone expression, restored cell cycle progression, diminished the replication-stress response, and reduced the production of inflammatory mediators in replicating T cells from old individuals. Correspondingly, treatment with SIRT1 inhibitors improved viral clearance in mice with miR-181a-deficient T cells after LCMV infection. In conclusion, SIRT1 inhibition may be beneficial to treat systemic viral infection in older individuals by targeting antigen-specific T cells that develop replication stress due to miR-181a deficiency.","Kim, Chulwoo; Jin, Jun; Ye, Zhongde; Jadhav, Rohit R; Gustafson, Claire E; Hu, Bin; Cao, Wenqiang; Tian, Lu; Weyand, Cornelia M; Goronzy, Jörg J",J. clin. invest,183,16

Here, we propose that Nsp15 activity may be inhibited by preventing its hexamerization through drug binding. We first explored the stable conformation of the Nsp15 monomer as the global free energy minimum conformation in the free energy landscape using a combination of parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics (PaCS-MD) and the Markov state model (MSM), and found that the Nsp15 monomer forms a more open conformation with larger druggable pockets on the surface. Targeting the pockets with high druggability scores, we conducted ligand docking and identified compounds that tightly bind to the Nsp15 monomer. The top poses with Nsp15 were subjected to binding free energy calculations by dissociation PaCS-MD and MSM (dPaCS-MD/MSM), indicating the stability of the complexes. One of the identified pockets, which is distinctively bound by inosine analogues, may be an alternative binding site to stabilize viral RNA binding and/or an alternative catalytic site. We constructed a stable RNA structure model bound to both UTP and alternative binding sites, providing a reasonable proposed model of the Nsp15/RNA complex.","Duy, Tran Yuta Taira Takumi Ogawa Ryoga Misu Yoshiki Miyazawa Akio Kitao",,183,16

Most of the people do not have the acquired immunity to fight this virus. There is no specific treatment or medicine to cure the disease. The effects of this disease appear to vary from individual to individual, right from mild cough, fever to respiratory disease. It also leads to mortality in many people. As the virus has a very rapid transmission rate, the entire world is in distress. The control and prevention of this disease has evolved as an urgent and critical issue to be addressed through technological solutions. The Healthcare industry therefore needs support from the domain of artificial intelligence (AI). AI has the inherent capability of imitating the human brain and assisting in decision-making support by automatically learning from input data. It can process huge amounts of data quickly without getting tiresome and making errors. AI technologies and tools significantly relieve the burden of healthcare professionals. In this paper, we review the critical role of AI in responding to different research challenges around the COVID-19 crisis. A sample implementation of a powerful probabilistic machine learning (ML) algorithm for assessment of risk levels of individuals is incorporated in this paper. Other pertinent application areas such as surveillance of people and hotspots, mortality prediction, diagnosis, prognostic assistance, drug repurposing and discovery of protein structure, and vaccine are presented.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of microRNA (miRNA)-10b and serum levels of IL-2 and IL-8 in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 33 COVID-19 patients and 29 healthy subjects. After RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, the transcript level of miR-10b was determined by Real-time PCR. In addition, the serum levels of IL-2 and IL-8 were measured in subjects using ELISA. RESULTS: The patient group comprised of 33 patients with COVID-19 (62.4 ± 3.7 years old), 13 (39%) males and 20 (61%) females. In the control group, 29 subjects (56.6 ± 1.6 years old), 9 (31%) males and 20 (69%) females, were included. The expression of miR-10b was significantly downregulated in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients in comparison to the healthy controls (fold change= 0.12, P< 0.0001). The levels of IL-2 (P< 0.001) and IL-8 (P< 0.001) were significantly increased in the serum samples of COVID-19 patients compared to the healthy subjects. The expression level of miR-10b was correlated significantly with the serum levels of IL-2 and IL-8 as well as with the age of patients, ESR and CRP levels. CONCLUSIONS: miR-10b is downregulated in the COVID-19 patients and might result in increased levels of IL-2 and IL-8, hence contributing to cytokine storm.","Bagheri-Hosseinabadi, Zahra; Ostad Ebrahimi, Hamid; Bahrehmand, Fatemeh; Taghipour, Gholamhosein; Abbasifard, Mitra",Iran J Immunol,183,16

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and prognostic value of conventional and non-conventional APA in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This study was a multi-centric, prospective observational French cohort of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 suspicion. RESULTS: 249 patients were hospitalized for suspected COVID-19, including 154 with confirmed COVID-19 and 95 not confirmed. We found a significant increase in lupus anticoagulant (LA) positivity among COVID-19 positive patients (60.9% versus 23.7% in non-COVID19 patients, p<0.001), while prevalence of conventional (anti-cardiolipin and anti-beta-2-GP1, IgG and IgM isotypes) and non-conventional APA (IgA, anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin and anti-prothrombin IgG and IgM) were low in both groups. COVID-19 patients with LA positivity had higher levels of fibrinogen (6.0 IQR 5.0-7.0 versus 5.3 g/L IQR 4.3-6.4, p=0.028) and C-reactive protein (CRP, 115.5 IQR 66.0-204.8 versus 91.8 mg/L IQR 27.0-155.1, p=0.019). Univariate analysis did not show any association between LA positivity and higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE, OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.44-2.43, p=0.95) or in-hospital mortality (OR 1.80, 95% CI 0.70-5.05, p=0.24).

METHODS: We created an agent-based stochastic network simulation using a variant of the standard SEIR dynamic infectious disease model. We considered a mask order that was initiated 3.5 months after the first confirmed COVID-19 case. We varied the likelihood of individuals wearing masks from 0–100% in steps of 20% (mask adherence) and considered 25% to 90% mask-related reduction in viral transmission (mask efficacy). Sensitivity analyses assessed early (by week 13) versus late (by week 42) adoption of masks and geographic differences in adherence (highest in urban and lowest in rural areas). RESULTS: Introduction of mask use with 50% efficacy worn by 50% of individuals reduces the cumulative infection attack rate (IAR) by 27%, the peak prevalence by 49%, and population-wide mortality by 29%. If 90% of individuals wear 50% efficacious masks, this decreases IAR by 54%, peak prevalence by 75%, and population-wide mortality by 55%; similar improvements hold if 70% of individuals wear 75% efficacious masks. Late adoption reduces IAR and deaths by 18% or more compared to no adoption. Lower adoption in rural areas than urban would lead to rural areas having the highest IAR. CONCLUSIONS: Even after community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been established, adoption of mask-wearing by a majority of community-dwelling individuals can meaningfully reduce the number and outcome of COVID-19 infections over and above physical distancing interventions.","Rosenstrom, Erik; Oruc, Buse Eylul; Hupert, Nathaniel; Ivy, Julie; Keskinocak, Pinar; Mayorga, Maria E.; Swann, Julie L.",medRxiv,183,18

This study aimed to compare the psychological responses of children exposed to different levels of stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: The anxiety levels, negative thoughts, and quality of life of COVID-19-positive children with COVID-19-positive parents (Child+ group, n=17), COVID-19-negative children who are separated from COVID-19-positive parents (Parent+ group, n=59), and a control group (n=64) were compared. The participants completed the Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Disorders (SCARED), Children’s Negative Cognitive Errors Questionnaire (CNCEQ), and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). RESULTS: The statistical analysis revealed that the Parent+ group recorded higher SCARED and CNCEQ scores and lower PedsQL scores in comparison with the control group. No statistically significant difference was found between the scores of the Child+ and control groups. Furthermore, high CNCEQ scores and low PedsQL scores in the Parent+ group predicted an increase in their SCARED scores. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that separating children from their parents during the COVID-19 outbreak negatively influences their mental health and increases their anxiety levels.","Kılınçel, Şenay; Altun, Feray Tarımtay; Nuryüz, Özgecan; Tan, Ezgi; Erzincan, Erkal; Kılınçel, Oğuzhan; Yazıcı, Esra; Ayaz, Muhammed",Psychiatry Investig,183,16

It was soon realized that ""DNA vaccination"" had numerous potential advantages over conventional vaccine approaches including inherent safety and a more rapid production time. These and other attributes make DNA vaccines ideal for development against emerging pathogens. Recent advances in optimizing various aspects of DNA vaccination have accelerated this approach from concept to reality in contemporary human trials. Although not yet licensed for human use, several DNA vaccines have now been approved for animal health indications. The rapid manufacturing capabilities of DNA vaccines may be particularly important for emerging infectious diseases including the current novel H1N1 Influenza A pandemic, where pre-existing immunity is limited. Because of recent advances in DNA vaccination, this approach has the potential to be a powerful new weapon in protecting against emerging and potentially pandemic human pathogens.","Moss, Ronald B",J Immune Based Ther Vaccines,183,22

In order to continue transplantation while protecting immunocompromised patients and healthcare workers, significant restructuring of normal patient care practice habits is required. Methods This is a non-randomized, descriptive study of the abdominal transplant program at one academic center (University of California, San Francisco) and the programmatic changes undertaken to safely continue transplantations. Patient transfers, fellow utilization, and patient discharge education were identified as key areas requiring significant reorganization. Results The University of California, San Francisco abdominal transplant program took an early and aggressive approach to restructuring inpatient workflows and healthcare worker staffing. We formalized a COVID-19 transfer system to address patients in need of services at our institution while minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 on our transplant ward and utilized technological approaches to provide virtual telehealth where possible, We also modified our transplant fellow staffing and responsibilities to develop an adequate backup system in the case of potential exposures. Conclusion Every transplant program is unique, and an individualized plan to adapt and modify standard clinical practices will be required to continue providing essential transplantation services. Our experience highlights areas of attention specific to transplant programs, and may provide generalizable solutions to support continued transplantation in the COVID-19 era.","Thiessen, Carrie; Wisel, Steven A.; Yamaguchi, Seiji; Dietch, Zachary C.; Feng, Sandy; Freise, Chris E.",Transplant Proc,183,1

This study aimed to examine available policies and guidelines around the use of masks and respirators in HCWs and to describe areas of consistency between guidelines, as well as gaps in the recommendations, with reference to the WHO and the CDC guidelines. METHODS: Policies and guidelines related to mask and respirator use for the prevention of influenza, SARS and TB were examined. Guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), three high-income countries and six low/middle-income countries were selected. RESULTS: Uniform recommendations are made by the WHO and the CDC in regards to protecting HCWs against seasonal influenza (a mask for low risk situations and a respirator for high risk situations) and TB (use of a respirator). However, for pandemic influenza and SARS, the WHO recommends mask use in low risk and respirators in high risk situations, whereas, the CDC recommends respirators in both low and high risk situations. Amongst the nine countries reviewed, there are variations in the recommendations for all three diseases. While, some countries align with the WHO recommendations, others align with those made by the CDC. The choice of respirator and the level of filtering ability vary amongst the guidelines and the different diseases. Lastly, none of the policies discuss reuse, extended use or the use of cloth masks. CONCLUSION: Currently, there are significant variations in the policies and recommendations around mask and respirator use for protection against influenza, SARS and TB. These differences may reflect the scarcity of level-one evidence available to inform policy development. The lack of any guidelines on the use of cloth masks, despite widespread use in many low and middle-income countries, remains a policy gap. Health organizations and countries should jointly evaluate the available evidence, prioritize research to inform evidence gaps, and develop consistent policy on masks and respirator use in the health care setting.","Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Seale, Holly; MacIntyre, Chandini Raina",BMC Res Notes,183,30

Being obligate intracellular parasites, viruses rely on the protein synthesis machinery of host cells to support replication, and not surprisingly, many viral proteins are subjected to PTMs. Coronavirus (CoV) is a group of enveloped RNA viruses causing diseases in both human and animals. Many CoV proteins are modified by PTMs, including glycosylation and palmitoylation of the spike and envelope protein, N- or O-linked glycosylation of the membrane protein, phosphorylation and ADP-ribosylation of the nucleocapsid protein, and other PTMs on nonstructural and accessory proteins. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on PTMs of CoV proteins, with an emphasis on their impact on viral replication and pathogenesis. The ability of some CoV proteins to interfere with PTMs of host proteins will also be discussed.","Fung, To Sing; Liu, Ding Xiang",Future Virol,183,16

Paralinguistic cues, such as repeated punctuation, are used to compensate for the lack of non-verbal cues in text-based formats. However, it is unclear whether these cues indeed bridge the potential gap between the writer’s intentions and the reader’s interpretations. A pilot study and two experiments investigated the effect of using repeated punctuation on behavioral intention to assist an email writer in a work-related situation. Findings demonstrate that while the intentions behind using repeated punctuation relate to signaling situational importance or affective state, behavioral intentions are driven by dispositional rather than situational attributions. Specifically, the use of repeated punctuation reduces perceived competence of the message writer and consequently decreases positive behavioral intentions. Overall, the study challenges the simplified view of paralinguistic cues as communication facilitators, highlighting their potential harmful effects on impression formation and behavioral intentions in the digital age.","Sidi, Yael; Glikson, Ella; Cheshin, Arik",Front Psychol,183,16

Lack of lockdown, open borders, high mortality rate, no herd immunity, no vaccination plan, and strong domestic anti-vaccination movement present serious COVID-19 concerns in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In such circumstances, we set out to study if the population is willing to receive the vaccine. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 10,471 adults in Bosnia and Herzegovina to assess the attitude of participants toward COVID-19 vaccination. Using a logistic regression model, we assessed the associations of sociodemographic characteristics with vaccine rejection, reasons for vaccine hesitancy, preferred vaccine manufacturer, and information sources. Surprisingly, only 25.7% of respondents indicated they would like to get a COVID-19 vaccine, while 74.3% of respondents were either hesitant or completely rejected vaccination. The vaccine acceptance increased with increasing age, education, and income level. Major motivation of pro-vaccination behaviour was intention to achieve collective immunity (30.1%), while the leading incentive for vaccine refusal was deficiency of clinical data (30.2%). The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is shown to be eightfold more preferred vaccine compared to the other manufacturers. For the first time, vaccine acceptance among health care professionals has been reported, where only 39.4% of healthcare professionals expressed willingness to get vaccinated. With the high share of the population unwilling to vaccinate, governmental impotence in securing the vaccines supplies, combined with the lack of any lockdown measures suggests that Bosnia and Herzegovina is unlikely to put COVID-19 pandemic under control in near future.","Fojnica, A.; Osmanovic, A.; Duzic, N.; Fejzic, A.; Mekic, E.; Gromilic, Z.; Muhovic, I.; Kurtovic-Kozaric, A.",,183,20

The food industry and food supply chain do not incorporate an exception. Considering a food supply chain, the business activities and supply of various food products have been suspended due to restriction of demand, closing the food production facilities, financial restrictions. Scope and approach According to the spreadability of the pandemic, every nation must understand the seriousness of the circumstance. This work aims to discuss the effect of COVID-19 on socioeconomic implications and the impact of lockdown on the food supply chain and agri-business. The paper also summarizes the suggestions needed to control and deduce the impact of COVID-19. For now, the chance of transmission through the food area is viewed as immaterial, and following Covid in workspaces isn't considered as a need by public authorities. However, the unfriendly impacts on the climate, food frameworks and individuals along the food store network are obvious. Key findings and conclusion A food supply chain facilities should concentrate on facilities like maintenance of employees' safety and health, change of conditions in working. To prevent the increment of food prices, the protectionist policy should avoid. We have also suggested a PDS system to overcome food supply chain disruption. In conclusion, the supply chain should respond and overcome the challenging situation in the food supply chain.","Barman, Abhijit; Das, Rubi; De, Pijus Kanti",Current Research in Behavioral Sciences,183,8

METHODS: Participants (N= 1267, 40.9% women) were recruited from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Haiti, Rwanda, and Togo. They completed an online cross-sectional survey on sociodemographics, exposure and stigmatization related to COVID-19, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression subscale, and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-2. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence for depression symptoms was 24.3% (95% CI: 22.08-26.79%), with significant differences across countries. Younger age, gender (women), and high levels of exposure and stigmatization related to COVIID-19, and resilience were associated with depression in the pooled data. There were significant variations at the country level. Stigmatization (but not exposure to COVID-19 and resilience) was a strong predictor among the four countries.

Current approaches are driven by practical considerations (e.g. first available virus isolate) rather than a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the virus strain chosen, which can lead to animal models that are not representative of the circulating or emerging clusters. Here, we suggest a combination of epidemiological, experimental and bioinformatic considerations when choosing virus strains for animal model generation. We discuss the currently chosen SARS‐CoV‐2 strains for international coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) models in the context of their phylogeny as well as in a novel alignment‐free bioinformatic approach. Unlike phylogenetic trees, which focus on individual shared mutations, this new approach assesses genome‐wide co‐developing functionalities and hence offers a more fluid view of the ‘cloud of variances’ that RNA viruses are prone to accumulate. This joint approach concludes that while the current animal models cover the existing viral strains adequately, there is substantial evolutionary activity that is likely not considered by the current models. Based on insights from the non‐discrete alignment‐free approach and experimental observations, we suggest isolates for future animal models.","Bauer, Denis C.; Tay, Aidan P.; Wilson, Laurence O.

Due to the different species and subtypes of this virus, the characterization of the biological significance of especially rare Ad is necessary. Previously, rare Ad types 70, 73, and 74 were originally isolated from fecal samples of immunocompromised patients and they represent recombinants of other Ad types. Here we investigated transduction experiments of these reporter gene tagged Ad types in primary cells exemplified by subject-derived primary nasal epithelial cells (NAEPCs). To analyze the transduction rates, we performed flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and cytokine analyses 25 h post-infection. We found that, in contrast to Ad type 5 (as a positive control), the transduction rates of NAEPCs with Ad types 70, 73, and 74 were interestingly low. The major Ad receptor (coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor and CD46) expression levels showed no significant change after infection with Ad types 70, 73 and 74. Moreover, Interleukin 6 (IL-6) was not released after in vitro Ad transduction.

In the absence of any specific treatment or vaccine against COVID-19, the role of efficient testing and reporting has been uncontested so far as the number of cases is rising daily. In order to strengthen the screening activities and to prevent nosocomial infection, facility-based screening centres have been designed and operated at various levels of healthcare, including tertiary care institutions. METHODS: The present study has been planned with an objective to understand the patient profile and evaluate the functioning of COVID-19 screening OPD (CS-OPD) at a tertiary care hospital. In this hospital-based retrospective study, data from individuals visiting the COVID-19 screening OPD during the period from 17(th) March 2020 to 31(st) July 2020 were collected. We documented and analysed relevant demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the patients. RESULTS: A total of 10,735 patients visited the COVID-19 screening OPD during the defined study period of which 3652 individuals were tested. The majority of the patients, i.e., 65.67% (7050) were male and in the 15–59 years age group (84.68%). The most common symptoms among patients visiting CS-OPD was cough (9.86%). Of the total, 17.17% (1843) of patients reported to the CS-OPD with a contact history of COVID-19–positive patient. On the other hand, 13.49% (1448) of patients were with either domestic or international travel history. The overall testing rate and positivity rate for CS-OPD during this period were found to be 34.02% and 7.94%, respectively.

The utility of rapid antigen-based methods for detection of common respiratory viruses and to confirm the cause of outbreaks is well established. However, nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) offer some benefits above antigen or culture-based procedures, with the main advantages being sensitivity and range of pathogens detectable. It is important to understand how changes in our testing methodology alter respiratory virus detection and information for epidemiological studies. For viruses such as influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus, NATs offer enhanced sensitivity above antigen assays but still identify the seasonal peaks important for predicting disease and managing time-sensitive prophylaxis. For other viruses, such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, human bocavirus and parainfluenza virus type 4, culture and antigen-based procedures are not available and/or lack sensitivity. Thus such targets would be missed if NATs were not included in testing for surveillance and outbreak investigation. As more respiratory viruses are identified there is a need to expand surveillance and further evaluate new technologies and automation beyond currently-available diagnostics to address detection of a broad range of potential pathogens.","Fox, Julie D.",Journal of Clinical Virology,183,16

Children and adolescents in communities with persistent poverty, disease (including HIV/AIDS), and violence, are more likely to suffer from chronic mental health problems. Combined, these characteristics negatively impact communities' response to HIV and mental health beginning with children, adolescents, and young adults. Yet, there is limited research capacity in child and adolescent mental health (CAMH), especially in the HIV/AIDS context in Uganda. Hence, this NIH-funded research training program aims to: (1) train three cohorts of early-career investigators at universities or research institutions in Uganda; (2) connect fellows with committed mentors; and (3) define key factors for successful mentorship and training of new investigators. Methods: CHILD-GRF is a multi-component program that engages selected young investigators in year-round activities for 3 years. Paired with mentors from Washington University in St. Louis and academic institutions in Uganda, fellows participate in a 6-week intensive summer training each year. Year 1 focuses on didactic learning and mentorship. In Year 2, fellows design and conduct their pilot study. Year 3 is devoted to presenting pilot study findings, manuscript preparation/ submission and extramural grant writing.

The aim of this research is to identify the determinants of banks’ voluntary climate change disclosure and the quality of that disclosure. Using data on 117 banks from 40 developed and developed countries around the world, we use ordinary least square regression and multivariate logit analysis to show that country-level and bank-level characteristics are much better predictors of bank commitment to voluntary carbon disclosure initiatives and environmental scores than they are of carbon disclosure quality. Banks want to project themselves as good citizens when they are located in a developed and environmentally friendly country, profitable, less risky, and subject to multiple-listing constraints. However, the picture is unclear when it comes to the implementation of rigorous carbon disclosure. This study extends the current state of knowledge on the impacts of size and country-level characteristics on carbon disclosure, finding that size and national context are not independent of carbon disclosure.","Caby, Jérôme; Ziane, Ydriss; Lamarque, Eric",Technol Forecast Soc Change,183,26

This helps the government in planning appropriate public health strategies. Therefore, this study intends to explore the perceptions of people towards COVID-19 and their experiences during the pandemic in Nepal. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study was conducted among the public in Kathmandu, Kanchanpur, Bajura and Jhapa districts of Nepal. Eight focus group discussions and 40 in-depth interviews were conducted by using a maximum variation sampling method. RESULTS: The findings were organised into the following themes: General understanding of COVID-19, Disease prevention, Source of information and misconceptions, Expectation and challenges; and Personal and societal consequences of COVID-19, social distancing and lockdown. There was a good general understanding among respondents about COVID-19, personal preventive measures and population-level strategies. They responded that the use of masks, sanitisers, handwashing and proper lockdown would help to prevent the disease. The respondents acknowledged the vital role of media in increasing awareness. Participants also expressed concerns over the misleading news spread by some media. The lack of social interaction, isolation and loss of income were raised as pertinent issues by the participants as potentially leading to psychological consequences. Health workers and public both raised concerns over inadequate Personal Protective Equipment, under-prepared health system, unorganised public quarantine centres, and public violation of lockdown CONCLUSIONS: This study reports participants’ views on disease prevention measures such as maintaining personal hygiene, adhering to physical distancing, and using personal protective equipments. Additionally, it illuminates the confusion among public due to conflicting public health messages from different sources of information which was deemed as misleading by the participants. This research sheds light on people’s perspectives and experiences that can inform population-targeted policies in the future.","Bhatt, Navin; Bhatt, Bandana; Gurung, Soniya; Dahal, Suresh; Jaishi, Amrit Raj; Neupane, Bandana; Budhathoki, Shyam Sundar",BMJ Open,183,20

The immunological changes associated with this infection are largely unknown. Methods We evaluated the peripheral blood mononuclear cells profile of 63 patients with COVID-19 at diagnosis and the presence of association with inflammatory biomarkers and 28-days mortality. Results Lymphocytopenia was present in 51 of 63 (80.9%) patients. This reduction was mirrored also on CD8+ lymphocytes (128 cells/uL), natural killer cells (67 cells/uL) and natural killer T cells (31 cells/uL). Monocytes were preserved in total number but displayed a subpopulation composed mainly of cells with a reduced expression of both CD14 and HLA-DR. A direct correlation was found between serum values of IL-6 and the frequency of Th2 lymphocytes (R=0.17; p=0.04) but not with the monocytes count (R=0.01; p=0.60). Patients who died in the 28 days from admission (N=10, 15.9%), when compared to those who did not, displayed lower mean values of CD3+ (p=0.028) and CD4+ cells (p=0.042) and higher mean percentages of CD8+/CD38+/HLA-DR+ lymphocytes (p=0.026).

The process of cardiac involvement is slow and lasts for years. Cardiac pathology manifests as an impaired diastolic function and cardiac hypertrophy at first and as dilatative cardiomyopathy and heart failure with time. From the moment of heart failure appearance, the prognosis is poor. Therefore, it is crucial to prevent those lesions by upfront therapy at the preclinical phase of the disease. The most useful diagnostic tool for detecting cardiac involvement is echocardiography. However, during an early phase of the disease, when patients do not present severe abnormalities in serum iron parameters and severe symptoms of other organ involvement, heart damage may be overlooked due to the lack of evident signs of cardiac dysfunction. Considerable advancement in echocardiography, with particular attention to speckle tracking echocardiography, allows detecting discrete myocardial abnormalities and planning strategy for further clinical management before the occurrence of substantial heart damage. The review aims to present the current state of knowledge concerning cardiac involvement in HH. In addition, it could help cardiologists and other physicians in their everyday practice with HH patients.","Daniłowicz-Szymanowicz, Ludmiła; Świątczak, Michał; Sikorska, Katarzyna; Starzyński, Rafał R.; Raczak, Alicja; Lipiński, Paweł",Diagnostics (Basel),183,16

To satisfy this demand, a new type of tourism, known as “dark tourism”, has arisen; it has various modalities, among which cemetery tourism and ghost tourism stand out, in addition to very different motivations from those of the cultural tourist. In this type of tourism, cemeteries are not visited to appreciate their architecture or heritage but to explore a morbid curiosity about the people buried there; ghost tourism or paranormal tourism seizes on the desire to know the events that occurred there and tends to have macabre content. This study analyzes dark tourism in the province of Córdoba in southern Spain with the aim of knowing the profile of the tourist and his motivation.

In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge of animal models of MERS-CoV infection. Commonly used laboratory animal species such as Syrian hamsters, mice and ferrets are not susceptible to MERS-CoV, due to differences in the MERS-CoV receptor dipeptyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). The initially developed animal models comprise two nonhuman primate species, the rhesus macaque and the common marmoset. Rhesus macaques develop a mild to moderate respiratory disease upon inoculation, reminiscent of milder MERS cases, whereas marmosets develop a moderate to severe respiratory disease, recapitulating the severe disease observed in some patients. Dromedary camels, considered to be the reservoir for MERS-CoV, develop a mild upper respiratory tract infection with abundant viral shedding. Although normal mice are not susceptible to MERS-CoV, expression of the human DPP4 (hDPP4) overcomes the lack of susceptibility. Transgenic hDPP4 mice develop severe and lethal respiratory disease upon inoculation with MERS-CoV. These hDPP4 transgenic mice are potentially the ideal first line animal model for efficacy testing of therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures. Further characterization of identified countermeasures would ideally be performed in the common marmoset model, due to the more severe disease outcome.

For this purpose, the EmA is used to investigate the sustainability, renewability, environmental impacts, and economic issues. The capacity of the NGPP and MSWPP are 247.5 and 3 MW, respectively. Results from this study show that the percent of renewability (PR) and emergy sustainability index (ESI) of the MSWPP are much more than those of the NGPP. The PR and ESI of the MSWPP are 46.81 and 1.65, while for the NGPP are 5.01 and 0.05, respectively. It is proved that the MSWPP is more efficient and has the better environmental impacts compared to the NGPP. Moreover, a hypothetical MSWPP with the same electricity output of the NGPP is studied using the EmA. A more efficient system with the higher PR and ESI is observed compared to the other case studies.

Meanwhile, pregnancy complications remain the leading cause of infant and childhood mortality under age five. Does it have to be this way? What more can we collectively, as a biomedical community, or individually, as clinicians who care for women and newborn babies at high risk for pregnancy complications, do to protect individuals in these extremely vulnerable developmental windows? The problem of pregnancy complications and neonatal mortality is extraordinarily complex, with multiple unique, but complementary perspectives from scientific, epidemiological and public health viewpoints. Herein, we discuss the epidemiology of pregnancy complications, focusing on how the outcome of prior pregnancy impacts the risk of complication in the next pregnancy — and how the fundamental immunological principle of memory may promote this adaptive response.","Gregory, Emily J.; Liu, James; Miller-Handley, Hilary; Kinder, Jeremy M.; Way, Sing Sing",Front Immunol,183,16

Based on our review of the literature on the CAIST, strategic competence, and available instruments for measuring the construct, we defined EFL learners' strategic competence in the CAIST as learners' use of four metacognitive strategies: Planning, problem-solving, monitoring, and evaluating, with each of them consisting of various components. These metacognitive strategies formulated the four factors and scale items of the SCICASA under validation. An exploratory factor analysis of responses from 254 EFL students and the subsequent confirmatory factor analysis of data collected on another sample of 242 students generated 23 items under the four factors. The high validity and reliability of the SCICASA reveal that EFL learners' strategic competence operates in the forms of the four metacognitive strategies in the CAIST. This will lend some new supporting evidence for Bachman and Palmer's (2010) strategic competence model while providing implications for metacognitive instructions and test development.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an approved, safe, and well-tolerated intervention for TRD. In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing the number of visits to the clinic is a potential approach to significantly minimize exposure and transmission risks to patients. This can be accomplished by administering multiple treatment sessions in a single day, using an rTMS protocol known as accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation (aiTBS). The objective of this novel study is to assess the feasibility, acceptance and clinical outcomes of a practical high-dose aiTBS protocol, including tapering treatments and symptom-based relapse prevention treatments, in patients with unipolar depression previously responsive to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or patients warranting ECT due to symptom severity. Methods: All patients with unipolar depression referred to the brain stimulation service at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) who warrant ECT will be offered screening to assess for eligibility to enroll in this trial. This open label, single group trial consists of 3 phases. In the acute treatment phase, treatment will occur 8 times daily for 5 days a week, until symptom remission is achieved or a maximum of 10 days of treatment. In the tapering phase, treatments will be reduced to 2 treatment days per week for 2 weeks, followed by 1 treatment day per week for 2 weeks. Patients will then enter the symptom-based relapse prevention phase including virtual check-ins and a treatment schedule based on symptom level. Remission, response and change in scores on several clinical measures from baseline to the end of the acute, tapering and relapse prevention phases represent the clinical outcomes of interest.

In favorable cases, ab initio predicted structures have yielded search models adequate for molecular replacement. The ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 represents a challenging case for MR using an ab initio prediction because ORF8 has an all β-sheet fold and few orthologs. We previously determined experimentally the structure of ORF8 using the single anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing method, having been unable to find an MR solution to the crystallographic phase problem. Following a report of an accurate prediction of the ORF8 structure, we assessed whether the predicted model would have succeeded as an MR search model.

It is necessary to explore the risk factors of heart after the operation of elderly patients with hip fracture during hospitalization. METHODS: Patients with hip fractures admitted to our hospital from January 1, 2019 to December 31 2020 were included, all the patients received internal fixation surgery. The characteristics of patients with and without postoperative heart failure were compared. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to analyze the risk factors of heart failure in elderly patients with hip fracture. RESULTS: A total of 283 patients with hip fractures were included, the incidence of heart failure was 12.37 %. There were significant differences in the age, hypertension, anemia hypoalbuminemia and duration of surgery between heart failure and no heart failure group(all p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the gender, BMI, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, history of heart failure, cognitive dysfunction, type of fracture, preoperative oxygen saturation, white blood cell count, platelet count, red blood cell count, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and estimated blood loss during surgery between heart failure and no heart failure group(all p > 0.05).

However, given that poor mental health is common in acute medical staff, we aimed to estimate the additional burden of work involving high exposure to infected patients. METHODS: We report a rapid review, meta-analysis, and living meta-analysis of studies using validated measures from outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1 influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). RESULTS: A random effects meta-analysis found that high-exposure work is not associated with an increased prevalence of above cut-off scoring (anxiety: RR = 1.30, 95% CI 0.87–1.93, Total N = 12,473; PTSD symptoms: RR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.75–1.78, Total N = 6604; depression: RR = 1.50, 95% CI 0.57–3.95, Total N = 12,224). For continuous scoring, high-exposure work was associated with only a small additional burden of acute mental health problems compared to low-exposure work (anxiety: SMD = 0.16, 95% CI 0.02–0.31, Total N = 6493; PTSD symptoms: SMD = 0.20, 95% CI 0.01–0.40, Total N = 5122; depression: SMD = 0.13, 95% CI -0.04–0.31, Total N = 4022). There was no evidence of publication bias.

We used simulation approaches to reproduce three actual cases where groups of hospital occupants reported to be either infected or not infected when SARS patients were hospitalized in nearby rooms. Simulations using both computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and multi-zone models were carried out to understand the dilution level of SARS virus-laden aerosols during these scenarios. We also conducted a series of measurements to validate the simulations. The ventilation rates (dilution level) for infection and non-infection were determined based on these scenarios. The safe ventilation rate for eliminating airborne viral infection is to dilute the air emitted from a SARS patient by 10000 times with clean air. Dilution at lower volumes, specifically 1000 times, is insufficient for protecting non-infected people from SARS exposure and the risk of infection is very high. This study provides a methodology for investigating the necessary ventilation rate from an engineering viewpoint.","Jiang, Yi; Zhao, Bin; Li, Xiaofeng; Yang, Xudong; Zhang, Zhiqin; Zhang, Yufeng",Build Simul,183,24

Additionally, several cases could not be traced to any imported cases and were suspected as sporadic local transmission. Twelve full viral genomes were determined in this study by Illumina sequencing either from virus isolates or directly from specimens, among which 5 originated from clustered infections. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that these sequences were in different clades, indicating that no major strain has been circulating in Taiwan. A deletion in open reading frame 8 was found in one isolate.

This resulted in major disruptions to one of the most common market processes in retail: food retailing. The research adopts the theory of planned behaviour to provide early empirical insights into changes in consumer behaviour related to food purchases during the initial stages of the COVID‐19 outbreak in China. Data from the online survey carried out suggest that the outbreak triggered considerable levels of switching behaviours among customers, with farmers’ markets losing most of their customers, while local small independent retailers experienced the highest levels of resilience in terms of customer retention. This study suggests avenues for further scholarly research and policy making related to the impact this behaviour may be having around the world on society’s more vulnerable groups, particularly the elderly.","Li, Junxiong; Hallsworth, Alan G.; Coca‐Stefaniak, J.

Studies have shown that this virus causes worse outcomes and a higher mortality in men than in women. It has been recognized that sex can affect the immune response to a pathogenic agent, as well as the susceptibility for some respiratory diseases. These different responses in males and females may be related to the actions of sex hormones. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) acts as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. The expression of ACE2 is influenced by sex hormones; therefore, we discuss in this article that this could be one of the reasons why COVID-19 is more prevalent in men than in women.","Gargaglioni, Luciane H.; Marques, Danuzia A.",J Appl Physiol (1985),183,26

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to identify studies assessing long-term effects of COVID-19 and estimates the prevalence of each symptom, sign, or laboratory parameter of patients at a post-COVID-19 stage. LitCOVID (PubMed and Medline) and Embase were searched by two independent researchers. All articles with original data for detecting long-term COVID-19 published before 1(st) of January 2021 and with a minimum of 100 patients were included. For effects reported in two or more studies, meta-analyses using a random-effects model were performed using the MetaXL software to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% CI. Heterogeneity was assessed using I(2) statistics. This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviewers and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, although the study protocol was not registered. A total of 18,251 publications were identified, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of 55 long-term effects was estimated, 21 meta-analyses were performed, and 47,910 patients were included. The follow-up time ranged from 14 to 110 days post-viral infection. The age of the study participants ranged between 17 and 87 years. It was estimated that 80% (95% CI 65–92) of the patients that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed one or more long-term symptoms. The five most common symptoms were fatigue (58%), headache (44%), attention disorder (27%), hair loss (25%), and dyspnea (24%). All meta-analyses showed medium (n=2) to high heterogeneity (n=13). In order to have a better understanding, future studies need to stratify by sex, age, previous comorbidities, severity of COVID-19 (ranging from asymptomatic to severe), and duration of each symptom.

As TB is a major public health problem in China, spatial analysis could be applied to detect geographic distribution of TB clusters for targeted intervention on TB epidemics. METHODS: Spatial analysis was applied for detecting TB clusters on county-based TB notification data in the national notifiable infectious disease case reporting surveillance system from 2005 to 2011. Two indicators of TB epidemic were used including new sputum smear-positive (SS+) notification rate and total TB notification rate. Global Moran’s I by ArcGIS was used to assess whether TB clustering and its trend were significant. SaTScan software that used the retrospective space-time analysis and Possion probability model was utilized to identify geographic areas and time period of potential clusters with notification rates on county-level from 2005 to 2011. RESULTS: Two indicators of TB notification had presented significant spatial autocorrelation globally each year (p<0.01). Global Moran’s I of total TB notification rate had positive trend as time went by (t=6.87, p<0.01). The most likely clusters of two indicators had similar spatial distribution and size in the south-central regions of China from 2006 to 2008, and the secondary clusters in two regions: northeastern China and western China. Besides, the secondary clusters of total TB notification rate had two more large clustering centers in Inner Mongolia, Gansu and Qinghai provinces and several smaller clusters in Shanxi, Henan, Hebei and Jiangsu provinces. CONCLUSION: The total TB notification cases clustered significantly in some special areas each year and the clusters trended to aggregate with time. The most-likely and secondary clusters that overlapped among two TB indicators had higher TB burden and risks of TB transmission. These were the focused geographic areas where TB control efforts should be prioritized.","Zhao, Fei; Cheng, Shiming; He, Guangxue; Huang, Fei; Zhang, Hui; Xu, Biao; Murimwa, Tonderayi C.; Cheng, Jun; Hu, Dongmei; Wang, Lixia",PLoS One,183,24

In the present study, a metabolic phenotype that could protect individuals from SARS-CoV-2 infection or predispose them to developing COVID-19 was investigated. Untargeted metabolomics was performed on serum samples collected from 51 healthcare workers who were in good health at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, and who were later exposed to the same risk of developing COVID-19. Half of them developed COVID-19 within three weeks of the blood collection. Our results demonstrate the presence of a specific signature associated with protection from SARS-CoV-2. Circulating monolaurin, which has well-known antiviral and antibacterial properties, was higher in protected subjects, suggesting a potential defensive role against SARS-CoV-2 infection; thus, dietary supplements could boost the immune system against this infection. In addition, our data demonstrate that people with higher levels of cholesterol are at higher risk of developing COVID-19.

This study aimed to estimate the monthly incidence of MERS-CoV cases and to investigate their correlation to climate factors. METHODS: The study used aggregated monthly MERS-CoV cases that reported to the Saudi Center for Disease Prevention and Control from the Riyadh Region between November 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018. Data on the meteorological situation throughout the study period was calculated based on Google reports on the Riyadh Region (24.7136 °N, 46.6753 °E). The Poisson regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each climate factor. RESULTS: A total of 712 MERS-CoV cases were included in the analysis (mean age 54.2 ± 9.9 years), and more than half (404) (56.1%) MERS-CoV cases were diagnosed during a five-month period from April to August. The highest peak timing positioned in August 2015, followed by April 2014, June 2017, March 2015, and June 2016. High temperatures (IRR = 1.054, 95% CI: 1.043–1.065) and a high ultraviolet index (IRR = 1.401, 95% CI: 1.331–1.475) were correlated with a higher incidence of MERS-CoV cases. However, low relative humidity (IRR = 0.956, 95% CI: 0.948–0.964) and low wind speed (IRR = 0.945, 95% CI: 0.912–0.979) were correlated with a lower incidence of MERS-CoV cases. CONCLUSION: The novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV, is influenced by climate conditions with increasing incidence between April and August. High temperature, high ultraviolet index, low wind speed, and low relative humidity are contributors to increased MERS-CoV cases. The climate factors must be evaluated in hospitals and community settings and integrated into guidelines to serve as source of control measures to prevent and eliminate the risk of infection.","Altamimi, Asmaa; Ahmed, Anwar E.",J Infect Public Health,183,16

To prepare for the second wave, it is vital to anticipate caseload demand, and thus, the number of required hospital beds for admitted cases and plan interventions through scenario analysis. In the present study, we analyzed the first wave data by age group so that the age-specific number of hospital admissions could be projected for the second wave. Because the age-specific patterns of the epidemic were different between urban and other areas, we analyzed datasets from two distinct cities: Osaka, where the cases were dominated by young adults, and Hokkaido, where the older adults accounted for the majority of hospitalized cases. By estimating the exponential growth rates of cases by age group and assuming probable reductions in those rates under interventions, we obtained projected epidemic curves of cases in addition to hospital admissions. We demonstrated that the longer our interventions were delayed, the higher the peak of hospital admissions. Although the approach relies on a simplistic model, the proposed framework can guide local government to secure the essential number of hospital beds for COVID-19 cases and formulate action plans.","Hayashi, Katsuma; Kayano, Taishi; Sorano, Sumire; Nishiura, Hiroshi",J Clin Med,183,27

The clinical spectrum of MIS-C ranges from mild to severe, and even to mortal multisystem involvement. To guide clinicians, we evaluated detailed demographic characteristics, clinical features, laboratory findings, and outcomes of MIS-C cases. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with MIS-C who were managed in the Department of Pediatric Infectious Disease in the Selcuk University Faculty of Medicine, Konya, Turkey. MIS-C patients were divided into three clinical severity groups (mild, moderate, and severe) and separated into three age groups (< 5 years, 5–10 years, > 10 years). We compared the characteristics of MIS-C cases according to the severity of the disease and by age groups. RESULT: Thirty-six children with MIS-C were evaluated (52.8% male, median age of 7.8 years). A clinical spectrum overlapping with Kawasaki disease (KD) was the most common presentation (69.4%) in all age groups. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (100%), mucocutaneous rash (69.4%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (66.6%). There was no statistically significant difference in echocardiographic abnormality between KD-like and the other clinical spectra (p > 0.05).

DESIGN: Mixed‐method design using online surveys (with validated components) and purposively sampled follow‐up semi structured interviews. METHODS: Funded from September 2020 for 12 months. Online surveys of adult women (aged 18–50) identified via all Wales kidney database (n ≥ 500), additional recruitment through multidisciplinary healthcare professionals, relevant third sector organizations and social media. Follow‐up in‐depth qualitative interviews with n = 30 women. Linear regression models to identify associations between shared decision‐making preferences and clinical and psychosocial variables. Qualitative interviews will use a visual timeline task to empower women in taking control over their narratives. Qualitative data will be fully transcribed and analysed thematically, based around a chronological and theoretical (theoretical domains framework) structure that maps out key challenges and opportunities for improved decision support in the care pathway. Visual timelines will be used during stakeholder consultation activities, to enable us to co‐create a map of current support, gaps in provision, and opportunities for interventions. Quantitative data will be analysed descriptively to characterize our cohort. We will assemble a multidisciplinary shared decision‐making intervention development group and provide ongoing stakeholder consultation activities with patient and public representatives. DISCUSSION: Outcomes will support new learning into; the ways women's knowledge of kidney disease may affect family planning and pregnancy, their needs in terms of psychological and social support, and how they weigh up the pros and cons of starting a family. IMPACT: Evidence will inform the design of new shared decision‐making tools to better support women with the complex and often emotional decisions about having children while living with kidney disease.","Phillips, Rhiannon; McLaughlin, Leah; Williams, Denitza; Williams, Helen; Noyes, Jane; Jones, Caron; Oleary, Catherine; Mallett, Carmen; Griffin, Sian",J Adv Nurs,183,20

Cross-sectoral communication is pivotal. Involvement of patients may add to intended mechanisms. A randomised controlled trial ‘The Partnership Study’ tested the effect of bringing together patient, general practitioner (GP) and oncologist for a consultation conducted by video. PURPOSE: As part of the process evaluation, this study aimed to explore experiences, attitudes and perspectives of the oncological department on sharing patient consultations with GPs using video. METHODS: Four semistructured interviews with five oncologists and four nurse specialists were conducted in February 2020. We focused on the informants’ experiences and reflections on the potential of future implementation of the concept ‘inviting the GP for a shared consultation by video’. The analyses were based on an inductive, open-minded, hermeneutic phenomenological approach. RESULTS: A total of six overall themes were identified: structuring consultation and communication, perceptions of GP involvement in cancer care, stressors, making a difference, alternative ways of cross-sector communication and needs for redesigning the model. The concept made sense and was deemed useful, but solving the many technical and organisational problems is pivotal. Case-specific tasks and relational issues were targeted by pragmatically rethinking protocol expectations and the usual way of communication and structuring patient encounters. Case selection was discussed as one way of maturing the concept. CONCLUSION: This Danish study adds new insight into understanding different aspects of the process, causal mechanisms as well as the potential of future implementation of video-based tripartite encounters. Beyond solving the technical problems, case selection and organisational issues are important. Acknowledging the disruption of the usual workflow, the introduction of new phases of the usual encounter and the variety of patient–GP relationships to be embraced may help to better understand and comply with barriers and facilitators of communication and sharing.

We explore the various risk factors associated with this occupational risk, especially focusing on India. This may elucidate lessons to protect these frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We carried out a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords such as ‘COVID-19’, ‘pandemics’, ‘physicians’ ‘mortality’ and ‘health personnel’ on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and ResearchGate in the month of July 2020 during the current COVID-19 pandemic and assessed mortality data. RESULTS: Mortality in health care professionals has been on the rise. The countries which faced the pandemic in the early months of 2020 have had a huge surge in mortality amongst doctors due to COVID-19. India continues to show a rising trend in COVID-19 cases, however although compared to the western world India has seen a comparatively favourable statistic. Male gender, elderly doctors and those belonging to Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) community seem to be predisposing factors in the western world. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has been associated with an increased mortality in doctors and health care workers. Until an effective cure/vaccine is developed, risk assessments at work, mitigating confounding factors, adequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) and enhanced protection against infection are necessary to protect health care professionals on the coronavirus frontline. Otherwise this occupational risk can lead to further untimely mortality and become another unintended consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Iyengar, Karthikeyan P.; Ish, Pranav; Upadhyaya, Gaurav Kumar; Malhotra, Nipun; Vaishya, Raju; Jain, Vijay K.",Diabetes Metab Syndr,183,26

A search for LAI and zoonoses in the Asia-Pacific region using online search engines revealed a relatively low number of reports. Only 27 LAI reports were published between 1982 and 2016. The most common pathogens associated with LAIs were dengue virus, Arthroderma spp., Brucella spp., Mycobacterium spp., Rickettsia spp., and Shigella spp. Seventy-eight percent (21 out of 27 LAI reports) occurred in high-income countries (i.e., Australia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan) where laboratories were likely to comply with international biosafety standards. Two upper-middle income countries (China (2), and Malaysia (2)) and one lower-middle income country (India (2)) reported LAI incidents. The majority of the reports (fifty-two percent (14/27)) of LAIs occurred in research laboratories. Five LAI reports were from clinical or diagnostic laboratories that are considered at the frontier for zoonotic disease detection. Governments and laboratories in the Asia-Pacific region should be encouraged to report LAI cases as it provides a useful tool to monitor unintended release of zoonotic pathogens and to further improve laboratory biosafety. Non-reporting of LAI events could pose a risk of disease transmission from infected laboratory staff to communities and the environment.

Optimising MV care to a specific patient with respiratory failure is difficult due to inter- and intra- patient variability in lung mechanics and condition. The ability to accurately predict patient-specific lung response to a change in MV settings would enable semi-automated care and significantly improve the efficiency of MV monitoring and care. It has particular emphasis when considering MV care required to treat Covid-19 patients, who require longer MV care, where patient-specific care can reduce the time on MV required. This study develops a nonlinear smooth hysteresis loop model (HLM) able to capture the essential lung dynamics in a patient-specific fashion from measured ventilator data, particularly for changes of compliance and infection points of the pressure-volume loop. The automated (no human input) hysteresis loop analysis (HLA) method is applied to identify HLM model parameters, enabling automated digital cloning to create a virtual patient model to accurately predict lung response at a specified positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) level, as well as in response to the changes of PEEP. The performance of this automated digital cloning approach is assessed using clinical data from 4 patients and 8 recruitment maneuver (RM) arms. Validation results show the HLM-based hysteresis loops identified using HLA match clinical pressure-volume loops very well with root-mean-square (RMS) errors less than 2% for all 8 data sets over 4 patients, validating the accuracy of the developed HLM in capturing the essential lung physiology and respiratory behaviours at different patient conditions. More importantly, the patient-specific digital clones at lower PEEP levels accurately predict lung response at higher PEEP levels with predicted peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) errors less than 2% in average. In addition, the resulted additional lung volume Vfrc obtained with PEEP changes are predicted with average absolute difference of 0.025L. The overall results validate the versatility and potential of the developed HLM for delineating changes of nonlinear lung dynamics, and its capability to create a predictive virtual patient with use of HLA for future treatment personalization and optimisation in MV therapy.","Zhou, Cong; Chase, J.

To be more effectively controlling the disease, it is critical to set up an optimal quarantine period so that about 95% of the cases developing symptoms will be retained for isolation. At the moment, the WHO-established quarantine period is 14 days based on previous reports which had studied small sizes of hospitalized cases (10 and ~100, respectively), however, over 80% of adult- and 95% of child-cases were not necessary to stay in hospitals, and therefore, had not been hospitalized. Therefore, we are questioning if the current-inferred median incubation time is representative for the whole Covid-19 population, and if the current quarantine period is optimal. Methods We compiled and analyzed the patient-level information of 2015 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases including 99 children in 28 Chinese provinces. This cohort represents a wide-range spectrum of Covid-19 disease with both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases. Results The full range of incubation periods of the Covid-19 cases ranged from 0 to 33 days among 2015 cases. There were 6 (0.13%) symptom-free cases including 4 females with a median age of 25.5 years and 2 males with a median age of 36 years. The median incubation period of both male and female adults was similar (7-day) but significantly shorter than that (9-day) of child cases (P=0.02). This cohort contained 4 transmission generations, and incubation periods of the cases between generations were not significantly different, suggesting that the virus has not been rapidly adapted to human beings. Interestingly, incubation periods of 233 cases (11.6%) were longer than the WHO-established quarantine period (14 days). Data modeling suggested that if adults take an extra 4-day or 7-day of isolation (i.e., a quarantine period of 18 or 21 days), 96.2% or 98.3%, respectively, of the people who are developing symptoms will be more effectively quarantined. Patients transmitted via lunch/dinner parties (i.e., gastrointestinal tract infection through oral transmission) had a significantly longer incubation period (9-day) than other adults transmitted via respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces and objects (P<0.004). Conclusions The whole Covid-19 population including both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases had a median incubation period of 7-day for adults, which is 1.8-day longer than the hospitalized cases reported previously. An extension of the adult quarantine period to 18 days or 21 days could be more effective in preventing virus-spreading and controlling the disease. The cases transmitted by lunch/dinner parties could be infected first in the gastrointestinal tract through oral transmission and then infected in the respiratory system so that they had a longer incubation period.","Jiang, Xue; Niu, Yawei; Li, Xiong; Li, Lin; Cai, Wenxiang; Chen, Yucan; Liao, Bo; Wang, Edwin",,183,8

We do not know its exact mortality rate nor the speed through which it spreads across communities. This lack of evidence complicates the design of appropriate response policies. METHODS: We source daily death registry data for 4100 municipalities in Italy’s north and match them to Census data. We augment the dataset with municipality-level data on a host of co-factors of COVID-19 mortality, which we exploit in a differences-in-differences regression model to analyze COVID-19-induced mortality. RESULTS: We find that COVID-19 killed more than 0.15% of the local population during the first wave of the epidemic. We also show that official statistics vastly underreport this death toll, by about 60%. Next, we uncover the dramatic effects of the epidemic on nursing home residents in the outbreak epicenter: in municipalities with a high share of the elderly living in nursing homes, COVID-19 mortality was about twice as high as in those with no nursing home intown. CONCLUSIONS: A pro-active approach in managing the epidemic is key to reduce COVID-19 mortality. Authorities should ramp-up testing capacity and increase contact-tracing abilities. Adequate protective equipment should be provided to nursing home residents and staff.","Ciminelli, Gabriele; Garcia-Mandicó, Sílvia",J Public Health (Oxf),183,23

The amount of medical information is expected to double every 2 years, which means that there will be 50 times more information available in 2020 than in 2011. In this setting, these large amounts of data or “big data” must be properly managed to implement new initiatives that improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of patients on the path to personalized medicine. The concept of personalization or precision medicine is of special interest in chronic respiratory disease. In recent years, research in entities such as asthma, COPD, cancer, or SAHS has focused on the identification of genomic, molecular, metabolic, and protein changes (biomarkers). Big data analysis tools can be used to move on from models based on the mean response to treatment, which are suboptimal for most patients, to focus on the individualized response. Part of this journey involves systems medicine, which also integrates clinical and population data to provide a multidimensional view of the disease and help identify causal associations that are usually only evident on big data analysis.","Prats, Lourdes; Luis Izquierdo, José",,183,29

SETTING: Publicly available symptom checkers for patient use. PARTICIPANTS: Publicly available symptom-checkers were identified. A standardised set of 50 clinical vignettes were developed and systematically run through each system by a non-clinical researcher. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: System accuracy was assessed by measuring the percentage of times the correct diagnosis was a) listed first, b) within the top five diagnoses listed and c) listed at all. The safety of the disposition advice was assessed by comparing it with national guidelines for each vignette. RESULTS: Twelve tools were identified and included. Mean diagnostic accuracy of the systems was poor, with the correct diagnosis being present in the top five diagnoses on 51.0% (Range 22.2 to 84.0%). Safety of disposition advice decreased with condition urgency (being 71.8% for emergency cases vs 87.3% for non-urgent cases). 51.0% of systems suggested additional resource utilisation above that recommended by national guidelines (range 18.0% to 61.2%). Both diagnostic accuracy and appropriate resource recommendation varied substantially between systems. CONCLUSIONS: There is wide variation in performance between available symptom checkers and overall performance is significantly below what would be accepted in any other medical field, though some do achieve a good level of accuracy and safety of disposition.

The positivity of a molecular test cannot respond to the question regarding the viral capability to replicate, spread, and give different clinical effects. Despite the fact that some targets are covered by commercially-available assays, the identification of new biomarkers is desired in order to improve the quality of the information given by these assays. Therefore, since the subgenomic transcripts (sgN and sgE) are considered markers of viral activity, we evaluated these subgenomic transcripts in relation to the genomic amplification obtained using five different commercial CE-IVD tools. Methods: Five CE-IVD kits were compared in terms of their capability to detect both synthetic SARS-CoV-2 viral constructs (spiked in TMB or PBS medium) and targets (N, E, RdRp and Orf1ab genes) in twenty COVID-19–positive patients’ swabs. The sgN and sgE were assayed by real-time RT-qPCR and digital PCR. Results: None of the diagnostic kits missed the viral target genes when they were applied to targets spiked in TMB or PBS (at dilutions ranging from 100 pg to 0.1 pg). Nevertheless, once they were applied to RNA extracted from the patients’ swabs, the superimposability ranged from 50% to 100%, regardless of the extraction procedure. The sgN RNA transcript was detected only in samples with a higher viral load (Ct ≤ 22.5), while sgE was within all of the Ct ranges. Conclusions: The five kits show variable performances depending on the assay layout. It is worthy of note that the detection of the sgN transcript is associated with a higher viral load, thus representing a new marker of early and more severe infection.","Zollo, Massimo; Ferrucci, Veronica; Izzo, Barbara; Quarantelli, Fabrizio; Domenico, Carmela Di; Comegna, Marika; Paolillo, Carmela; Amato, Felice; Siciliano, Roberto; Castaldo, Giuseppe; Capoluongo, Ettore",Diagnostics (Basel),183,16

The city imposed different levels of social distancing including, the closure of sports venues and restrictions on eateries. This inevitably affects the eating behaviour and physical activities of the population. We examined the changes in eating behavior and physical activities before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and identified sociodemographic factors associated with the behavioral changes. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study via a random telephone survey of Chinese adults conducted in Hong Kong from May to June, 2020 - a period in which social distancing measures were being imposed. We measured the physical activity habits from four aspects and dietary consumption patterns from seven aspects before and during the pandemic based on the World Health Organization’s guidelines and previous publications. RESULTS: In total, 724 participants were recruited. Individuals were found to cook more frequently at home (p < 0.001) and order take-out (p < 0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. While no significant change in the frequency of fast food consumption was observed, we found significant increases in the frequency of eating fruits (p < 0.001) and vegetables (p = 0.004). The frequencies of walking, moderate-intensive sports, and high-intensity sports were significantly reduced (p < 0.001). We found that healthy lifestyle behaviors during the pandemic were negatively associated with participants’ economic status. CONCLUSIONS: Social distancing measures likely provided an opportunity for individuals to stay home and thus eat healthier. However, in a prolonged period of social restrictions, a lower physical activity level poses a risk to public health. Public health officials are thus advised to monitor physical health on a population-wide basis. The findings highlighted the importance of interventions tailored to individuals who have prolonged home stays - particularly for individuals in the low economic group.","Wang, Jingxuan; Yeoh, Eng Kiong; Yung, Tony Ka Chun; Wong, Martin Chi Sang; Dong, Dong; Chen, Xiao; Chan, Maggie Ka Ying; Wong, Eliza Lai Yi; Wu, Yushan; Guo, Zihao; Wang, Yawen; Zhao, Shi; Chong, Ka Chun",J Int Soc Sports Nutr,183,21

Integrated arts and humanities courses have been found to serve four primary functions: mastering skills, perspective taking, personal insight, and social advocacy. To what extent and how arts and humanities programs achieve these educational outcomes remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to explore how the arts and humanities may lead to perceived benefits in clinical skills development, professional identity formation, and self-care, and to evaluate the feasibility of delivering an arts and humanities-based course online. METHODS: We developed and delivered a 1-week online arts and humanities course to second- through fourth-year medical students. A total of 18 students enrolled in the course across its 2 offerings in Spring 2020. The course was primarily visual arts based but also included activities based in other arts and humanities, such as literature, reflective writing, dance, film, music, philosophy, and religion. Using a mixed methods approach, daily polls assessed student engagement in and perceptions of the various activities, and a postcourse survey assessed student perceptions of the course as a whole. RESULTS: At least 93% of poll respondents (14/15 to 17/18) across the 2 cohorts rated each type of activity as good or excellent. Qualitative analysis of student responses to the postcourse survey revealed themes concerning both the form (overall course design and online format) and the function of the course (skills development, appreciation of new perspectives, and personal inquiry). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggested that the arts and humanities may support the development of clinically relevant skills and attitudes. A more unique finding was that integrative arts and humanities courses delivered online-including those that are primarily visual arts based-engage students and may yield personal and professional benefits.","Stouffer, Kaitlin; Kagan, Heather J; Kelly-Hedrick, Margot; See, Julia; Benskin, Elizabeth; Wolffe, Suzy; Yenawine, Philip; Chisolm, Margaret S",JMIR Med Educ,183,16

Based on Noblit and Hare (1988), meta-ethnography was used to address meaning by synthesizing knowledge and understanding inductively through selected qualitative studies (n = 16). Four core themes were identified: (1) supporting the parents to awaken to parenthood and creating a firm foundation for early parenting and their new life situation; (2) guiding parents on the path to parenthood and new responsibility; (3) ensuring normality and the bond between baby and parents while protecting life; and (4) promoting the health and wellbeing of the family today and in the future. The overarching theme can be expressed as “helping the woman and her partner prepare for their new life with the child by providing individualized, shared care, firmly grounded and with a view of the future”. Caring in antenatal care (ANC) is being totally present, listening and using multidimensional professional competence but also being open-minded to new aspects and knowledge. The health promotion and positive health aspects should be considered an important part of supporting parents and the whole family now and in the future. A more conscious salutogenic approach to ANC would lead to more favorable results and could be a fruitful research topic in the future.

We aimed to identify clinical and biological markers associated with severe forms of COVID-19 in HD patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational and multicentric study. Sixty-two consecutive adult HD patients with confirmed COVID-19 from four dialysis facilities in Paris, France, from 19 March to 19 May 2020 were included. Blood tests were performed before diagnosis and at Days 7 and 14 after diagnosis. Severe forms of COVID-19 were defined as requiring oxygen therapy, admission in an intensive care unit or death. Cox regression models were used to compute adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs). Kaplan–Meier curves and log-rank tests were used for survival analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (45%) displayed severe forms of COVID-19. Compared with non-severe forms, these patients had more fever (93% versus 56%, P < 0.01), cough (71% versus 38%, P = 0.02) and dyspnoea (43% versus 6%, P < 0.01) at diagnosis. At Day 7 post-diagnosis, neutrophil counts, neutrophil:lymphocyte (N:L) ratio, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen and lactate dehydrogenase levels were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 patients. Multivariate analysis revealed an N:L ratio >3.7 was the major marker associated with severe forms, with an aHR of 4.28 (95% confidence interval 1.52–12.0; P = 0.006). After a median follow-up time of 48 days (range 27–61), six patients with severe forms died (10%). CONCLUSIONS: HD patients are at increased risk of severe forms of COVID-19. An elevated N:L ratio at Day 7 was highly associated with the severe forms. Assessing the N:L ratio could inform clinicians for early treatment decisions.","Mutinelli-Szymanski, Prisca; Hude, Iulia; Merle, Emilie; Lombardi, Yannis; Seris, Pascal; Abtahi, Medhi; Azeroual, Latifa; Bourgain, Cecile; Ensergueix, Gael; Katerinis, Ioannis; Kolko, Anne; Kolta, Amir; Maheas, Catherine; Mehrbanian, Saeed; Morel, Pauline; Ossman, Rim; de Préneuf, Hélène; Roux, Arthur; Saltiel, Claudine; Vendé, Florence; Verhoeven, Anne-Sophie; Viron, Béatrice; Laplanche, Sophie; Le Monnier, Alban; Ridel, Christophe; Ureña-Torres, Pablo; Touzot, Maxime",Clin Kidney J,183,26

Cell entry is mediated by the human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). ACE2 and its close homolog angiotensin-converting enzyme I (ACE) are currently discussed candidate genes, in which single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could alter binding or entry of SARS-CoV-2 and enhance tissue damage in the lung or other organs. This could increase the susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed genotyping of SNPs in the genes ACE2 and ACE in 297 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 253 SARS-CoV-2-negative tested patients. We analyzed the association of the SNPs with susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients did not differ regarding demographics and clinical characteristics. For ACE2 rs2285666, the GG genotype or G-allele was significantly associated with an almost two-fold increased SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and a three-fold increased risk to develop serious disease or COVID-19 fatality. In contrast, the ACE polymorphism was not related to infection risk or severity of disease. In a multivariable analysis, the ACE2 rs2285666 G-allele remained as an independent risk factor for serious disease besides the known risk factors male gender and cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our report appears to be the first showing that a common ACE2 polymorphism impacts the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the course of COVID-19 independently from previously described risk factors.","Möhlendick, Birte; Schönfelder, Kristina; Breuckmann, Katharina; Elsner, Carina; Babel, Nina; Balfanz, Paul; Dahl, Edgar; Dreher, Michael; Fistera, David; Herbstreit, Frank; Hölzer, Bodo; Koch, Michael; Kohnle, Matthias; Marx, Nikolaus; Risse, Joachim; Schmidt, Karsten; Skrzypczyk, Sarah; Sutharsan, Sivagurunathan; Taube, Christian; Westhoff, Timm H.; Jöckel, Karl-Heinz; Dittmer, Ulf; Siffert, Winfried; Kribben, Andreas",Pharmacogenet Genomics,183,0

This study explores how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted palliative care workers around the world and describes the coping strategies they have adopted to face their specific situation. METHOD: We conducted a qualitative analysis of written, unstructured comments provided by respondents to a survey of IAHPC members between May and June 2020. Free text was exported to MAX QDA, and a thematic analysis was performed by reading the comments and developing a coding frame. RESULTS: Seventy-seven palliative care workers from 41 countries submitted at least one written comment, resulting in a data corpus of 10,694 words and a total of 374 coded comments. Eight main themes are emerged from the analysis: palliative care development, workforce impact, work reorganization, palliative care reconceptualization, economic and financial impacts, increased risk, emotional impact, and coping strategies. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The pandemic has had a huge impact on palliative care workers including their ability to work and their financial status. It has generated increased workloads and placed them in vulnerable positions that affect their emotional well-being, resulting in distress and burnout. Counseling and support networks provide important resilience-building buffers. Coping strategies such as team and family support are important factors in workers’ capacity to adapt and respond. The pandemic is changing the concept and praxis of palliative care. Government officials, academia, providers, and affected populations need to work together to develop, and implement steps to ensure palliative care integration into response preparedness plans so as not to leave anyone behind, including health workers.","Pastrana, Tania; De Lima, Liliana; Pettus, Katherine; Ramsey, Alison; Napier, Genevieve; Wenk, Roberto; Radbruch, Lukas",Palliative & supportive care,183,20

Here we describe the current epidemiological picture of MERS-CoV, focusing on humans and animals affected by this virus and propose specific intervention strategies that would be appropriate to control MERS-CoV. One-third of MERS-CoV patients develop severe lower respiratory tract infection and succumb to a fatal outcome; these patients would require effective therapeutic antiviral therapy. Because of the lack of such intervention strategies, supportive care is the best that can be offered at the moment. Limiting viral spread from symptomatic human cases to health care workers and family members, on the other hand, could be achieved through prophylactic administration of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and vaccines. To ultimately prevent spread of the virus into the human population, however, vaccination of dromedary camels – currently the only confirmed animal host for MERS-CoV – may be the best option to achieve a sustained drop in human MERS cases in time.

Subsequently, on March 12, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,614 deaths were reported. Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus, that is distributed in birds, humans, and other mammals. WHO has named the novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19. More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID-19. Hence, we performed a search in March 2020 of the clinicaltrials.gov database. The eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were: contain a clinicaltrials.gov base identifier number; describe the number of participants and the period for the study; describe the participants’ clinical conditions; and utilize interventions with medicines already studied or approved for any other disease in patients infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV). It is essential to emphasize that this article only captured trials listed in the clinicaltrials.gov database. We identified 24 clinical trials, involving more than 20 medicines, such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). Although drug repurposing has some limitations, repositioning clinical trials may represent an attractive strategy because they facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they have lower costs and take less time to reach the market; and there are existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution.","Rosa, Sandro G.

Fear of getting sick from COVID-19, government’s lockdown and the imposed social distancing might have had an impact on psychological distress and QoL. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to investigate anxiety, depression and QoL changes in pwMS during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and lockdown in Italy. METHODS: 67 pwMS with a previous (less than 6 months) neuropsychological evaluation before SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (T0) were re-evaluated at the time of the outbreak and lockdown in Italy (T1). They underwent a clinical and neurological evaluation and completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y1), the Beck Depression Inventory second edition (BDI-II), and Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MsQoL-54) at T0 and T1. Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was applied to control the false discovery rate. RESULTS: BDI-II and STAI-Y1 scores did not change between T0 and T1. At T1, MsQoL-54 scores were higher on the satisfaction with sexual life and the social function subscales, and lower on the limitation due to emotional problems subscale. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that evaluated mood and QoL levels before and during the lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic in pwMS. No worsening of anxiety and depression levels was found. Contrariwise some improvements were noted on QoL, the most reliable regarding the sexual satisfaction and the social function.","Capuano, Rocco; Altieri, Manuela; Bisecco, Alvino; d’Ambrosio, Alessandro; Docimo, Renato; Buonanno, Daniela; Matrone, Federica; Giuliano, Federica; Tedeschi, Gioacchino; Santangelo, Gabriella; Gallo, Antonio",J Neurol,183,20

Findings from an online MTurk sample,16.407097,3.501599,2020-08-17,"BACKGROUND: Lewis-Sumner Syndrome (LSS) is considered an asymmetric sensory-motor variant of Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP), mostly affecting the limbs distally, with electrophysiological evidence of multifocal motor conduction blocks. Cranial nerve involvement is present in a minority. Various well-known infectious agents, directly or via the host’s immune responses, may trigger or exacerbate acute and chronic peripheral neuropathies, which may manifest clinically through a multitude of signs and symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 57-year-old male with Lewis-Sumner Syndrome, whose clinical course was quite stable over many years. He developed severe hyperacute relapse of his neuropathic disease in the context of active pneumonia due to influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. During this exacerbation, besides the obvious worsening of the previous asymmetric limb involvement, the patient also manifested left peripheral facial palsy and dysphagia that rapidly evolved over minutes, mimicking a stroke. The patient also showed rapid recovery, with marked improvement of the acute neuropathic dysfunction, immediately after initiation of treatment with oseltamivir. Our hypothesis is that the direct modulation of Na + ion channel activity in the host’s peripheral nerve cell by H1N1 viral proteins could cause acute and potentially reversible dysfunction in the conduction of nerve action potentials. Direct viral neuritis could also have been the cause. Immunomodulatory agents, namely IVIg, were not administered due to the swift clinical improvement noticed in the following days.

We demonstrate and discuss important assumptions relative to the parameterization and structural treatment of airline travel in mathematical models. Among other findings, we show that the most common structural treatment of travelers leads to underestimation of the speed of spread and that connecting travel is critical to a realistic spread pattern.

The treatment of the disease largely remains symptomatic but repurposed drugs used to treat other disease conditions are being used to treat moderate to severe form of the disease. As the clinical trials for these drugs are ongoing, we conducted this survey to know the physicians’ medical treatment plan for COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was a web-based questionnaire study. Institutional ethical committee clearance was taken before the commencement of the study. There were a total of 17 questions, the first 6 being about the demographics, place of work, and whether the clinician was involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. Subsequent 11 questions were to assess physician's awareness and plan of the medical management of the COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The majority of the clinicians were aware of the various treatment modalities available for the treatment of COVID-19. Regarding the plan for use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), 55% of the total respondents intended to use the drug in combination with azithromycin, even as 62% agreed that there was no clear evidence yet. About 90% of all clinicians, from junior residents to consultants, were monitoring electrocardiogram (ECG) during HCQ therapy; however, there were 10% of physicians who were not practicing ECG monitoring. About 68% of clinicians were aware of the various therapeutic options being tested, like convalescent plasma, lopinavir–ritonavir, and 64% knew about remdesivir. There was divergence regarding the use of steroids in a cytokine storm among the physicians, with only 39% of consultants planning to use steroids whereas about 50% of junior residents and 79% of junior consultants were planning to use the drug. CONCLUSION: The majority of the clinicians involved in the management of COVID-19 were aware of the various drug modalities available for treatment. However, more emphasis on the adverse effects and possible drug interactions is required. There is disaccord regarding the use of steroids in cytokine storm in COVID-19 and further guidelines and educational programs should address these issues. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Clinicians have to be made more aware of the possible adverse effects and drug interactions of the medications used for the treatment of COVID-19. The treatment of the serious, cytokine storm syndrome and the role of steroids must be elucidated as soon as it is feasible. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Maddani SS, Chaudhuri S, Deepa HC, Amara V.

CASE PRESENTATION: A man in his forties was diagnosed with subacute thyroiditis after a mild COVID-19 infection. This is an important differential diagnosis to consider if after a period of improvement, an infected patient develops fever, pain around the region of the thyroid (throat/neck) and/or symptoms of hyperthyroidism. INTERPRETATION: Subacute thyroiditis is thought to be initiated by a viral infection or postviral inflammatory process, often in patients with a history of an upper respiratory infection typically two to eight weeks prior to the onset of thyroiditis. The condition is believed to be triggered by an antigen created by the virus. Subacute thyroiditis must be on the list of possible differential diagnoses in patients with COVID-19 whose condition deteriorates after a period of improvement.","Tjønnfjord, Eirik; Moe, Ragnar Bekkhus; Ghanima, Waleed; Aballi, Saad",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen,183,5

The current situation has led many countries to implement drastic rules to stop the spread of the virus. According to the Spanish health authority decisions need to be made in the context of uncertainty and lack of knowledgeable experiences through a gradual and asymmetric de-escalation process planned in four phases. Although the vast majority of studies refer to economic risks and impacts on tourist flows and economic income, few of them explicitly investigates safety and health measures that hotel managers should implement to their customers. Over a population of 12,740 hotels, 823 Spanish hotel managers have been involved in a participatory study. With the aim of assessing the actions taken to stop the spread of the virus, empirical research was implemented. A model presented four variables and 13 indicators which have been previously tested among hotel managers in the tourism sector. Five conclusions are drawn from the hypotheses: (1) Mass testing surveillance in customers and employees should be quick, affordable, and homogeneous throughout the European Union. (2) Training measures need to be taken by both public authorities and the private sector to reach a knowledgeable crisis management team with high commitment to the customer’s health and safety. (3) Protocols established by public authorities should be observed and adjusted gradually not only in hotels but also in tourist arrivals. (4) Healthy measures need to be periodically updated. (5) Each hotel should set up a surveillance process to guarantee the safety to their customers.","Robina-Ramírez, Rafael; Medina-Merodio, Jose-Amelio; Moreno-Luna, Libertad; Jiménez-Naranjo, Héctor V.; Sánchez-Oro, Marcelo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,183,26

Based on Schwartz's theory of human basic values, the current study combines variable-centered and person-centered approaches to examine the relationships between adolescents' values and mental health across two regions in China. The results generally showed that (1) both self-enhancement and conservation values were positively correlated with depression and loneliness, while both self-transcendence and openness to change values negatively correlated with depression and loneliness. The results also showed that (2) there were four value clusters (i.e., self-focus, other-focus, anxiety-free, undifferentiated), and, compared to adolescents in the self-focus and undifferentiated values cluster, all adolescents in the anxiety-free values cluster reported lower depression and loneliness, while all adolescents in the other-focus values cluster reported higher depression and loneliness. The differences between the two regional groups only emerged in depression. Specifically, adolescents in Shanghai have higher levels of depression than adolescents in Qingdao. This study provides some evidence for the new science of self-transcendence among adolescents and also sheds light on how we may improve the level of mental health during the COVID-19 era.","Liu, Ping; Wang, Xiaofeng; Li, Dan; Zhang, Rongwei; Li, Hui; Han, Jingxin",Front Psychol,183,1

A remarkable ability of the HGM as a key player in the development of a normal immune system is its ability to recognize stress signals in its environment, e.g., triggers by viruses and other pathogenic microorganisms, and to react accordingly. SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 disease, represents an unfamiliar type of virus to the human organism due to a lack of regular encounters between them over the course of evolution. This is one possible explanation of the disproportionate response of both innate and acquired immune systems seen in many people. In this review, we analyze certain immunomodulatory aspects of the HGM. We also assess the state of research in the field of next-generation probiotics, such as pharmacbiotics and postbiotics, and their potential use for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The range of symptoms typical of COVID-19 infection is presented in a concise form. The impact of COVID-19 infection on various organs and systems will be examined in future studies. Nevertheless, although we are in the early stages of the pandemic, we can still predict that COVID-19 will have a large impact of on the incidence of tuberculosis and depression in various populations around the world. The HGM, depending on whether it is normal or dysfunctional (dysbiosis), can be an important predictor of the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. These factors need to be taken into account, and, perhaps, a set of measures for the rehabilitation of certain groups of the population should be adopted. These measures should include the development of next-generation pharmacbiotics (psychobiotics, probiotics exhibiting antioxidant properties, immunobiotics), as well as specialized functional foods.","Belkina, T.

Faced with a new reality, and until a vaccine or efficient treatment is found, humanity must figure out ways to keep economy going on one hand, yet keep the population safe on the other hand, especially those that are susceptible to this virus. Here we use a network simulation, with parameters that were drawn from what is known about the virus, to explore 5 different scenarios of partial lock down release. We find that separating age groups by reducing interactions between age groups, protects the general population and reduces mortality rates. Furthermore, addition of new connections within the same age group to compensate for the lost connections outside the age group, still has a strong beneficial influence and reduces the total death toll by 66%. While complete isolation from society may be the most protective scenario for the elderly population, it would have an emotional and possibly cognitive impact that might outweigh its benefit. We therefore propose creating age-related social recommendations or even restrictions, thereby allowing social connections but still strong protection for the older population.","Mizrahi, L.; Stern, S.",,183,7

During the pandemic, some pediatric hospitals reported their experiences. After the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the health-care system needs to be reorganized in order to manage again all non-urgent activities, while ensuring safety of both patients and HCW. Material and Methods We developed preventive measures to limit any possibility of COVID-19 spread, according to the principles of epidemiological prevention and suggestions from recent literature. In order to evaluate the efficacy of these measures, we retrospectively reviewed the neurosurgical activity at our Institution from May 4th to July 15th, 2020. Results 119 patients were admitted in the Neurosurgical ward and 80 surgical procedures were performed. Furthermore, 130 outpatient clinics were scheduled. A total of 258 nasopharyngeal swabs and 249 specific interview were performed. In our series, no cases of positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection were found and no surgical cases were postponed. Discussion We present the management of the neurosurgical activity after the emergency phase at the Neurosurgical Department of Giannina Gaslini Children’s Hospital of Genoa, Italy. Conclusion Italian healthcare system is undertaking a process of reorganization of resources, in an attempt to restore all non urgent activities while ensuring safety. After the emergency phase, we are learning to live together with COVID-19 and, although epidemiological data are encouraging, we must be prepared for an eventual second peak.","Ceraudo, Marco; Balestrino, Alberto; Cama, Armando; Macrina, Gianni; Piatelli, Gianluca; Consales, Alessandro",World Neurosurg,183,6

Design: Retrospective clinical audit and simulation model. Setting: Multiple UK NHS ophthalmology centres. Participants: Data on the reduction in new nAMD referrals was obtained from four NHS Trusts in England comparing April 2020 to April 2019. To estimate the potential impact on one-year visual outcomes, a stratified bootstrap simulation model was developed drawing on an electronic medical records dataset of 20,825 nAMD eyes from 27 NHS Trusts. Main outcome measures: Simulated mean visual acuity and proportions of eyes with vision [≤]6/60, [≤]6/24 and [≥]6/12 at one year under four hypothetical scenarios: no treatment delay, 3, 6 and 9-month treatment delays. Estimated additional number of eyes with vision [≤]6/60 at one year nationally. Results: The number of nAMD referrals at four major eye treatment hospital groups based in England dropped on average by 72% (range 65 to 87%) in April 2020 compared to April 2019. Simulated one-year visual outcomes for 1000 nAMD eyes with a 3-month treatment delay suggested an increase in the proportion of eyes with vision [≤]6/60 from 15.5% (13.2 to 17.9) to 23.3% (20.7 to25.9), and a decrease in the proportion of eyes with vision [≥]6/12 (driving vision) from 35.1% (32.1 to 38.1) to 26.4% (23.8 to29.2). Outcomes worsened incrementally with longer modelled delays. Assuming nAMD referrals are reduced to this level at the national level for only one month, these simulated results suggest an additional 186-365 eyes with vision [≤]6/60 at one-year with even a short treatment delay. Conclusions: We report a large decrease in nAMD referrals during the first month of COVID-19 lockdown and provide an important public health message regarding the risk of delayed treatment. As a conservative estimate, a treatment delay of 3 months could lead to a >50% relative increase in the number of eyes with vision [≤]6/60 and 25% relative decrease in the number of eyes with driving vision at one year.","Thomas, D.

Currently, the world is suffering from the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the host cells. In COVID-19, neurological manifestations have been reported to occur. The present study demonstrates that the protein expression level of ACE2 is upregulated in the brain of Alzheimer’s disease patients. The increased ACE2 expression is not age-dependent, suggesting the direct relationship between Alzheimer’s disease and the ACE2 expression. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease brains examined in this study also exhibited higher carbonylated proteins as well as increased thiol oxidation state of peroxiredoxin 6 (Prx6). The positive correlation was found between the increased ACE2 protein expression and oxidative stress in Alzheimer’s disease brain. Thus, the present study reveals the relationships between Alzheimer’s disease and ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. These results warrant monitoring Alzheimer’s disease patients with COVID-19 carefully for the possible higher viral load in the brain and long-term adverse neurological consequences.","Ding, Qiyue; Shults, Nataliia V.; Harris, Brent T.; Suzuki, Yuichiro J.",bioRxiv,183,22

In early January 2021, a novel variant of concern (VOC) designated B.1.429 comprising 2 lineages, B.1.427 and B.1.429, was originally detected in California (CA) and shown to enhance infectivity in vitro and decrease antibody neutralization by plasma from convalescent patients and vaccine recipients. Here we examine the virulence, transmissibility, and susceptibility to pre-existing immunity for B 1.427 and B 1.429 in the Syrian hamster model. We find that both strains exhibit enhanced virulence as measured by increased body weight loss compared to hamsters infected with ancestral B.1 (614G), with B.1.429 causing the most body weight loss among all 3 lineages. Faster dissemination from airways to parenchyma and more severe lung pathology at both early and late stages were also observed with B.1.429 infections relative to B.1. (614G) and B.1.427 infections. In addition, subgenomic viral RNA (sgRNA) levels were highest in oral swabs of hamsters infected with B.1.429, however sgRNA levels in lungs were similar in all three strains. This demonstrates that B.1.429 replicates to higher levels than ancestral B.1 (614G) or B.1.427 in the upper respiratory tract (URT) but not in the lungs. In multi-virus in-vivo competition experiments, we found that epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) and gamma (P.1) dramatically outcompete alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351) and zeta (P.2) in the lungs. In the URT gamma, and epsilon dominate, but the highly infectious alpha variant also maintains a moderate size niche. We did not observe significant differences in airborne transmission efficiency among the B.1.427, B.1.429 and ancestral B.1 (614G) variants in hamsters.

The ongoing pandemic demonstrates the importance of having an emergency response plan that accounts for the safety of frontline healthcare workers, including those working in critical care settings. OBJECTIVES: To explore Australian critical care nurses’ knowledge, preparedness and experiences of managing patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. METHODS: An exploratory cross-sectional study of Australian critical care nurses was conducted between June and September 2020. An anonymous online survey was sent to Australian College of Critical Care Nurses (ACCCN) members to collect information about their knowledge, preparedness and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise and report data. RESULTS: A total of 157 critical care nurses participated, with 138 fully complete surveys analysed. Most respondents reported ‘good’ to ‘very good’ level of knowledge about COVID-19, and obtained up-to-date COVID-19 information from international and local sources. To manage patients with COVID-19, 82.3% felt sufficiently prepared at the time of data collection, and 93.4% had received specific education, training or instruction. Most participants were involved in assessing (89.3%) and treating (92.4%) COVID-19 patients. Varying levels of concerns about contracting SARS-CoV-2 were expressed by respondents, and 55.7% thought the pandemic had increased their workload. The most frequent concerns expressed by participants were a lack of appropriate PPE and fear of the PPE shortage. CONCLUSIONS: While most nurses expressed sufficient preparedness for managing COVID-19 patients, specific education had been undertaken and experiential learning was evident. Fears of insufficient or appropriate PPE made the response more difficult for nurses and the community. Preparedness and responsiveness are critical to successful management of the COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases.","Nahidi, Shizar; Sotomayor-Castillo, Cristina; Li, Cecilia; Currey, Judy; Elliott, Rosalind; Shaban, Ramon Z.",Aust Crit Care,183,22

These guidelines originate from Australia and New Zealand, Canada, China, India, Italy, Korea, Singapore, the United States and the United Kingdom.

Pre-pandemic difficult airway guidelines include those from Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, Scandinavia, the United States and the United Kingdom. These difficult airway guidelines require modifications in order to align with the principles of the anesthetic COVID-19 guidelines. In turn, most of the anesthetic COVID-19 guidelines do not, or only briefly, discuss an airway strategy after failed tracheal intubation. Our article identifies and compares pre-pandemic difficult airway guidelines with the recent anesthetic COVID-19 guidelines. We combine the principles from both sets of guidelines and explain the necessary modifications to the airway guidelines, to form a failed tracheal intubation airway strategy in the COVID-19 patient.

Previous research on risk and resilience highlights that children's adjustment to family hardships is influenced by caregiver stress, but individual child behaviors and characteristics may protect children from negative outcomes. Interestingly, many children have been reported to incorporate COVID-19 themes in their pretend play. Theory suggests children may do so to cope with pandemic-related stress, but no empirical studies have explored this possibility. The purpose of this study was to understand the process by which COVID-19 economic hardships experienced by a family were related to children's emotional well-being and development and to investigate how this process may vary as a function of children's engagement in pandemic-related pretend play. Caregivers (N = 99; mostly high earning families) of preschoolers ages 3–6 years (51% girls, 82% White) living in the United States participated in an online survey at two time points during the pandemic. Result revealed that COVID-19 economic hardships were related to increased caregiver stress, which, in turn, was associated with children's emotional distress and poorer self-regulation. However, engaging in pandemic-related pretend play appeared to protect children's well-being by weakening the adverse association between caregivers' stress and children's emotional distress. Thus, addressing caregiver stress levels and allowing children an outlet to cope with challenges through pretend play could have crucial protective effects on early development and well-being during times of crisis.","Thibodeau-Nielsen, Rachel B.; Palermo, Francisco; White, Rachel E.; Wilson, Alaina; Dier, Shannon",Front Psychol,183,21

Extensive mutations in the spike protein of variants B.1.1.7, B1.351, and P.1 have raised concerns that the efficacy of current vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies could be threatened. In vitro studies have shown that one mutation, E484K, plays a crucial role in the loss of neutralizing activity of some monoclonal antibodies as well as most convalescent and vaccinee sera against variant B.1.351. In fact, two vaccine trials have recently reported lower protective efficacy in South Africa, where B.1.351 is dominant. To survey for these novel variants in our patient population in New York City, PCR assays were designed to identify viruses with two signature mutations, E484K and N501Y. We observed a steady increase in the detection rate from late December to mid-February, with an alarming rise to 12.3% in the past two weeks. Whole genome sequencing further demonstrated that most of our E484K isolates (n=49/65) fell within a single lineage: NextStrain clade 20C or Pangolin lineage B.1.526. Patients with this novel variant came from diverse neighborhoods in the metropolitan area, and they were on average older and more frequently hospitalized.

METHODS: Using a mixed methods design, results examined 1) characteristics of the rapid return mandate, 2) preparation received by children and families, 3) support services provided since the return, and 4) primary concerns for children and families. RESULTS: Data revealed that rapid return was characterized by compressed timelines that did not allow for adequate child and family assessment and preparation. However, all respondents indicated they believed at least some families would be able to remain intact safely with appropriate support. Primary concerns for children and families related to unresolved antecedents to separation, lack of economic capacity, limited monitoring, and lack of access to education.

These are proteins with roles in virus entry or morphogenesis. In the case of the HIV fusion protein gp41 cholesterol binding is attributed to a cholesterol recognition consensus (CRAC) motif in a flexible domain of the ectodomain preceding the trans-membrane segment. This specific CRAC sequence mediates gp41 binding to a cholesterol affinity column. Mutations in this motif arrest virus fusion at the hemifusion stage and modify the ability of the isolated CRAC peptide to induce segregation of cholesterol in artificial membranes. Influenza A virus M2 protein co-purifies with cholesterol. Its proton translocation activity, responsible for virus uncoating, is not cholesterol-dependent, and the transmembrane channel appears too short for integral raft insertion. Cholesterol binding may be mediated by CRAC motifs in the flexible post-TM domain, which harbours three determinants of binding to membrane rafts. Mutation of the CRAC motif of the WSN strain attenuates virulence for mice. Its affinity to the raft–non-raft interface is predicted to target M2 protein to the periphery of lipid raft microdomains, the sites of virus assembly. Its influence on the morphology of budding virus implicates M2 as factor in virus fission at the raft boundary. Moreover, M2 is an essential factor in sorting the segmented genome into virus particles, indicating that M2 also has a role in priming the outgrowth of virus buds. SFV E1 protein is the first viral type-II fusion protein demonstrated to directly bind cholesterol when the fusion peptide loop locks into the target membrane. Cholesterol binding is modulated by another, proximal loop, which is also important during virus budding and as a host range determinant, as shown by mutational studies.","Schroeder, Cornelia",Cholesterol Binding and Cholesterol Transport Proteins:,183,12

The results supported the social capital–accrual hypothesis by showing that the approach coping style was inversely associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both social networking and perceived family support. The results also supported the escape-from-self hypothesis by revealing that the avoidant coping style was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both gaming and cyberbullying victimization, but the serial mediation model was no longer significant after Time 1 depression and some demographic risk factors had been controlled for. Finally, the results supported the time-displacement hypothesis by showing that gaming was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its inverse associations with social networking and perceived family support. CONCLUSIONS: During the extended stay-at-home period in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of probable depression during the 2-month study period was high among the UK and US residents. Individuals with distinct coping styles may engage in different types of online leisure activities and perceive varying levels of social support, which are associated with risks of probable depression.","Cheng, Cecilia; Lau, Yan-Ching; Luk, Jeremy W",J Med Internet Res,183,20

AIMS: To evaluate airborne contamination levels within intensive care unit (ICU) isolation rooms over 10–24-h periods in order to improve understanding of the variability of environmental aerial bioburden, and the extent to which ward activities may contribute. METHODS: Environmental air monitoring was conducted within occupied and vacant inpatient isolation rooms. A sieve impactor sampler was used to collect 500-L air samples every 15 min over 10-h (08:00–18:00 h) and 24-h (08:00–08:00 h) periods. Samples were collected, room activity was logged, and bacterial contamination levels were recorded as colony-forming units (cfu)/m(3) air. FINDINGS: A high degree of variability in levels of airborne contamination was observed across all scenarios in the studied isolation rooms. Air bioburden increased as room occupancy increased, with air contamination levels highest in rooms occupied for the longest time during the study (10 days) (mean 104.4 cfu/m(3), range 12–510 cfu/m(3)). Counts were lowest in unoccupied rooms (mean 20 cfu/m(3)) and during the night. CONCLUSION: Peaks in airborne contamination were directly associated with an increase in activity levels. This study provides the first clear evidence of the extent of variability in microbial airborne levels over 24-h periods in ICU isolation rooms, and found direct correlation between microbial load and ward activity.","Dougall, L.R.; Booth, M.G.; Khoo, E.; Hood, H.; MacGregor, S.J.; Anderson, J.G.; Timoshkin, I.V.; Maclean, M.",J Hosp Infect,183,22

The virus infection causes respiratory illness named by the world health organization as corona virus 19 (COVID-19).This systematic review aims to study and summarize the different neurological manifestations of this virus. All articles published and indexed via Pubmed, Medline and Google Scholar databases between January 1st 2020 and February 28th 2021 that reported neurological symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 are reviewed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.We included data from 113 articles: eight prospective studies, 25 retrospective studies and the rest were case reports/series. COVID-19 can present with central nervous system manifestations, such as headache, encephalitis and encephalopathy, peripheral nervous system manifestations, such as anosmia, ageusia and Guillian Barre syndrome, and skeletal muscle manifestations, such as myalgia and myasthenia gravis. Our systematic review showed that COVID-19 can be manifested by a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms reported either in the early stage or within the course of the disease. However, a detailed comprehension of these manifestations is required and more studies are needed in order to improve our scientific knowledge and to develop preventive and therapeutic measures to control this pandemic.","Ousseiran, Zeina Hassan; Fares, Youssef; Chamoun, Wafaa Takash",Int J Neurosci,183,21
