3830,Perturbation of Thymocyte Development Underlies the PRRS Pandemic: A Testable Hypothesis,2019-05-15,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes immune dysregulation during the Critical Window of Immunological Development. We hypothesize that thymocyte development is altered by infected thymic antigen presenting cells (TAPCs) in the fetal/neonatal thymus that interact with double-positive thymocytes causing an acute deficiency of T cells that produces “holes” in the T cell repertoire allowing for poor recognition of PRRSV and other neonatal pathogens. The deficiency may be the result of random elimination of PRRSV-specific T cells or the generation of T cells that accept PRRSV epitopes as self-antigens. Loss of helper T cells for virus neutralizing (VN) epitopes can result in the failure of selection for B cells in lymph node germinal centers capable of producing high affinity VN antibodies. Generation of cytotoxic and regulatory T cells may also be impaired. Similar to infections with LDV, LCMV, MCMV, HIV-1 and trypanosomes, the host responds to the deficiency of pathogen-specific T cells and perhaps regulatory T cells, by “last ditch” polyclonal B cell activation. In colostrum-deprived PRRSV-infected isolator piglets, this results in hypergammaglobulinemia, which we believe to be a “red herring” that detracts attention from the thymic atrophy story, but leads to our second independent hypothesis. Since hypergammaglobulinemia has not been reported in PRRSV-infected conventionally-reared piglets, we hypothesize that this is due to the down-regulatory effect of passive maternal IgG and cytokines in porcine colostrum, especially TGFβ which stimulates development of regulatory T cells (Tregs).","Butler, John E.; Sinkora, Marek; Wang, Gang; Stepanova, Katerina; Li, Yuming; Cai, Xuehui",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6529568/,427
4260,Risk perception and behavioral change during epidemics: Comparing models of individual and collective learning,2020-01-06,"Modern societies are exposed to a myriad of risks ranging from disease to natural hazards and technological disruptions. Exploring how the awareness of risk spreads and how it triggers a diffusion of coping strategies is prominent in the research agenda of various domains. It requires a deep understanding of how individuals perceive risks and communicate about the effectiveness of protective measures, highlighting learning and social interaction as the core mechanisms driving such processes. Methodological approaches that range from purely physics-based diffusion models to data-driven environmental methods rely on agent-based modeling to accommodate context-dependent learning and social interactions in a diffusion process. Mixing agent-based modeling with data-driven machine learning has become popularity. However, little attention has been paid to the role of intelligent learning in risk appraisal and protective decisions, whether used in an individual or a collective process. The differences between collective learning and individual learning have not been sufficiently explored in diffusion modeling in general and in agent-based models of socio-environmental systems in particular. To address this research gap, we explored the implications of intelligent learning on the gradient from individual to collective learning, using an agent-based model enhanced by machine learning. Our simulation experiments showed that individual intelligent judgement about risks and the selection of coping strategies by groups with majority votes were outperformed by leader-based groups and even individuals deciding alone. Social interactions appeared essential for both individual learning and group learning. The choice of how to represent social learning in an agent-based model could be driven by existing cultural and social norms prevalent in a modeled society.","Abdulkareem, Shaheen A.; Augustijn, Ellen-Wien; Filatova, Tatiana; Musial, Katarzyna; Mustafa, Yaseen T.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6944362/,427

7571,The effect of randomness for dependency map on the robustness of interdependent lattices,2016-01-19,"The extreme eigenvalues of adjacency matrices are important indicators on the influence of topological structures to the collective dynamical behavior of complex networks. Recent findings on the ensemble averageability of the extreme eigenvalue have further authenticated its applicability to the study of network dynamics. However, the ensemble average of extreme eigenvalue has only been solved analytically up to the second order correction. Here, we determine the ensemble average of the extreme eigenvalue and characterize its deviation across the ensemble through the discrete form of random scale-free network. Remarkably, the analytical approximation derived from the discrete form shows significant improvement over previous results, which implies a more accurate prediction of the epidemic threshold. In addition, we show that bimodal networks, which are more robust against both random and targeted removal of nodes, are more vulnerable to the spreading of diseases.","Chung, N. N.; Chew, L.

The infective etiology and the immunopathology can be best determined through endomyocardial biopsy with a complete work-up by light microscopy, immunohistology, and polymerase chain reaction for microbial agents. This review focuses on the methodological advances in diagnosis in the past few years and exemplifies the importance of an etiology-orientated treatment in different case scenarios. In fulminant nonviral myocarditis, immunosuppressive treatment together with hemodynamic stabilization of the patient via mechanical circulatory support (e.g., microaxial pumps, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, left ventricular assist device) can be life-saving. For viral inflammatory cardiomyopathy, intravenous immunoglobulin treatment can resolve inflammation and often eradicate the virus.","Maisch, Bernhard; Pankuweit, Sabine",Herz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198648/,427
11900,Readiness for Responding to a Severe Pandemic 100 Years After 1918,2018-08-09,"Mortality estimates of the 1918 influenza pandemic vary considerably, and recent estimates have suggested that there were 50 million to 100 million deaths worldwide. We investigated the global mortality burden using an indirect estimation approach and 2 publicly available data sets: the Human Mortality Database (13 countries) and data extracted from the records of the Statistical Abstract for British India. The all-cause Human Mortality Database was used to estimate mortality annually for 1916–1921 for detailed age groups. Three different calculation methods were applied to the data (low, medium, and high scenarios), and we used a multilevel regression model to control for distorting factors (e.g., war and the underlying time trend in mortality). Total pandemic mortality was an estimated 15 million deaths worldwide in 1918 (n = 2.5 million in 1919) after including the rates for British India and controlling for wars and the underlying mortality trend. According to our validity analysis, simulations of total number of deaths being greater than 25 million are not realistic based on the underlying mortality rates included in Human Mortality Database and in British India. Our results suggest the global death impact of the 1918 pandemic was important (n = 17.4 million) but not as severe as most frequently cited estimates.","Spreeuwenberg, Peter; Kroneman, Madelon; Paget, John",Am J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314216/,427

However, more research is needed to address whether it is applicable for distance education. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were used to test the Chinese version of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire part-B for distance learning (MSLQ-B-DL) using two samples totalling 385 participants. This paper substantiates MSLQ-B-DL's criterion-related, convergent, and factorial validity, as well as its internal consistency, in China. Specifically, the concurrent validity of the MSLQ-B-DL was shown from three aspects: (a) the negative correlation of MSLQ-B-DL with trait procrastination; (b) the positive correlation of MSLQ-B-DL with self-control; and (c) the positive correlation of MSLQ-B-DL with instrumental help-seeking and the former's negative correlation with help-seeking avoidance and executive help-seeking. Finally, this study highlights the MSLQ-B-DL's validity and reliability in evaluating the learning strategies in adult distance education in China.","Zhou, Ying; Wang, Jianhua",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7940182/,427

16508,Life Course Air Pollution Exposure and Cognitive Decline: Modelled Historical Air Pollution Data and the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936,2021-02-02,"Approximately three percent of the human genome is occupied by microsatellites: a type of short tandem repeat (STR). Microsatellites have well established effects on (a) the genetic structure of diverse human populations and (b) expression of nearby genes. These lines of inquiry have uncovered 3,984 ethnically biased microsatellite loci (EBML) and 28,375 expression STRs (eSTRs), respectively. We hypothesize that a combination of EBML, eSTRs, and gene expression data (RNA-seq) can be used to show that microsatellites contribute to differential gene expression and phenotype in human populations. In fact, our previous study demonstrated a degree of mutual overlap between EBML and eSTRs but fell short of quantifying effects on gene expression. The present work aims to narrow the gap. First, we identify 313 overlapping EBML/eSTRs and recapitulate their mutual overlap. The 313 EBML/eSTRs are then characterized across ethnicity and tissue type. We use RNA-seq data to pursue validation of 49 regions that affect whole blood gene expression; 32 out of 54 affected genes are differentially expressed in Africans and Europeans. We quantify the relative contribution of these 32 genes to differential expression; fold change tends to be less than other differentially expressed genes. Repeat length correlates with expression for 15 of the 32 genes; two are conspicuously involved in glutathione metabolism. Finally, we repurpose a mathematical model of glutathione metabolism to investigate how a single polymorphic microsatellite affects phenotype. We conclude with a testable prediction that microsatellite polymorphisms affect GPX7 expression and oxidative stress in Africans and Europeans.","Kinney, Nick; Kang, Lin; Bains, Harpal; Lawson, Elizabeth; Husain, Mesam; Husain, Kumayl; Sandhu, Inderjit; Shin, Yongdeok; Carter, Javan K.; Anandakrishnan, Ramu; Michalak, Pawel; Garner, Harold",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7993785/,427
16802,"Food-based strategies for prevention of vitamin D deficiency as informed by vitamin D dietary guidelines, and consideration of minimal-risk UVB radiation exposure in future guidelines",2020-10-27,"RATIONALE: NAA15 (N-alpha-acetyltransferase 15) is a component of the NatA (N-terminal acetyltransferase complex). The mechanism by which NAA15 haploinsufficiency causes congenital heart disease remains unknown. To better understand molecular processes by which NAA15 haploinsufficiency perturbs cardiac development, we introduced NAA15 variants into human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and assessed the consequences of these mutations on RNA and protein expression. OBJECTIVE: We aim to understand the role of NAA15 haploinsufficiency in cardiac development by investigating proteomic effects on NatA complex activity and identifying proteins dependent upon a full amount of NAA15. METHODS AND RESULTS: We introduced heterozygous loss of function, compound heterozygous, and missense residues (R276W) in iPSCs using CRISPR/Cas9. Haploinsufficient NAA15 iPSCs differentiate into cardiomyocytes, unlike NAA15-null iPSCs, presumably due to altered composition of NatA. Mass spectrometry analyses reveal ≈80% of identified iPSC NatA targeted proteins displayed partial or complete N-terminal acetylation. Between null and haploinsufficient NAA15 cells, N-terminal acetylation levels of 32 and 9 NatA-specific targeted proteins were reduced, respectively. Similar acetylation loss in few proteins occurred in NAA15 R276W induced pluripotent stem cells. In addition, steady-state protein levels of 562 proteins were altered in both null and haploinsufficient NAA15 cells; 18 were ribosomal-associated proteins. At least 4 proteins were encoded by genes known to cause autosomal dominant congenital heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: These studies define a set of human proteins that requires a full NAA15 complement for normal synthesis and development. A 50% reduction in the amount of NAA15 alters levels of at least 562 proteins and N-terminal acetylation of only 9 proteins. One or more modulated proteins are likely responsible for NAA15-haploinsufficiency mediated congenital heart disease. Additionally, genetically engineered induced pluripotent stem cells provide a platform for evaluating the consequences of amino acid sequence variants of unknown significance on NAA15 function.","Ward, Tarsha; Tai, Warren; Morton, Sarah; Impens, Francis; Van Damme, Petra; Van Haver, Delphi; Timmerman, Evy; Venturini, Gabriela; Zhang, Kehan; Jang, Min Young; Willcox, Jon A.L.; Haghighi, Alireza; Gelb, Bruce D.; Chung, Wendy K.; Goldmuntz, Elizabeth; Porter, George A.; Lifton, Richard P.; Brueckner, Martina; Yost, H.

17246,From the Editor's Desk: Publishing in Times of a Pandemic,2021-04-15,"BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota are reported to be altered in critical illness. The pattern and impact of dysbiosis on prognosis has not been thoroughly investigated in the ICU setting. AIMS: We aimed to evaluate changes in the gut microbiota of ICU patients via 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing, assess the association of the changes with antibiotics use or disease severity, and explore the association of gut microbiota changes with ICU patient prognosis. METHODS: Seventy-one mechanically ventilated patients were included. Fecal samples were collected serially on days 1–2, 3–4, 5–7, 8–14, and thereafter when suitable. Microorganisms of the fecal samples were profiled by 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing. RESULTS: Proportions of the five major phyla in the feces were diverse in each patient at admission. Those of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes especially converged and stabilized within the first week from admission with a reduction in α-diversity (p < 0.001). Significant differences occurred in the proportional change of Actinobacteria between the carbapenem and non-carbapenem groups (p = 0.030) and that of Actinobacteria according to initial SOFA score and changes in the SOFA score (p < 0.001). An imbalance in the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes within seven days from admission was associated with higher mortality when the ratio was > 8 or < 1/8 (odds ratio: 5.54, 95% CI: 1.39–22.18, p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Broad-spectrum antibiotics and disease severity may be associated with gut dysbiosis in the ICU.

19906,European Myeloma Network perspective on CAR T-cell therapies for multiple myeloma,2021-04-01,"INTRODUCTION: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been indicated as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy in high risk patients. Sometimes, an aortic arch can be anatomically unfavourable for CAS. Herein we report our experience in a case of CAS with transcervical approach. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 77-year-old male was referred to our hospital for severe subtotal occlusion of the left internal carotid artery. He had a past medical history of radiation to the head and neck for laryngeal cancer. Previous CT-angiography had shown a type III aortic with bovine arch. CAS via transcervical approach was performed with transitory reversal flow during the placement of RX Spider Filter 6 Fr (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). After release of 7 × 30 mm RX Xact carotid stent (Abbott Vascular, Chicago, IL) and ballooning with a 5.5 × 30 mm Rx Submarine balloon catheter (Medtronic Minneapolis, MN), angiography check showed a good result. DISCUSSION: The transcervical approach is an innovative technique where usually a shunt is created, either between the common carotid artery and the internal jugular vein or between the common carotid artery and the common femoral vein. This flow reversal reduces the risk of periprocedural embolic events. In our experience a short proximal clamping with transitory reversal flow, reduces the invasiveness of procedure with good outcomes. CONCLUSION: Transcervical carotid access with transitory reversal flow is a valid alternative in complicated patient with anatomy unfit for CAS.","Dinoto, E.; Ferlito, F.; Tortomasi, G.; Evola, S.; Bajardi, G.; Pecoraro, F.",Int J Surg Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8335628/,427

The survey aimed at assessing tobacco use (shisha and cigarettes) as well as examining the association between current tobacco use and various sociodemographic and war-related factors. The sample comprised 978 participants (251 males: 727 females) and had a mean age of 24.7 years (SD: 7.60). Most participants were single (n = 825, 84.4%), reside in Damascus and Rif-Dimashq (n = 579, 59.2%), and had a college/university education (n = 911, 93.1%). Concerning smoking, a total of 371 participants (37.9%) were identified to be current tobacco smokers, of whom 211, 84, 76 were exclusive shisha smokers, exclusive cigarette smokers, and dual smokers, respectively. The prevalence of cigarette smoking (exclusive and dual) among males and females was found to be 34.7%, and 10.0%, respectively. On the other hand, the prevalence of shisha smoking (exclusive and dual) among males and females was around 34.3% and 27.6%, respectively. Additionally, various factors have predicted a higher likelihood of cigarette smoking including male gender (AOR = 4.152; 95% CI: 2.842–6.064; p<0.001), and losing someone due to the war (AOR = 1.487; 95% CI: 1.028–2.151; p = 0.035), while unemployed individuals were found to have lower odds of being cigarette smokers (AOR = 0.634; 95% CI: 0.429–0.937; p = 0.022). Concerning shisha smoking, married (AOR = 0.622; 95% CI: 0.402–0.963; p = 0.033), and unemployed individuals (AOR = 0.679; 95% CI: 0.503–0.916; p = 0.011) were found to have lower odds of shisha smoking. Amid the tobacco epidemic in the region, rates of tobacco use in Syria are still worrying. The Syrian armed conflicts may possess a double-edged effect on smoking, and tobacco users who adopt smoking to cope with various stressors should be targeted with well-structured health education, along with appropriate psychological services.","Kakaje, Ameer; Alhalabi, Mohammad Marwan; Alyousbashi, Ayham; Ghareeb, Ayham; Hamid, Loura; Al-Tammemi, Ala’a B.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8412248/,427

Epidemiological studies have suggested that the main cause of death in critical patients is pulmonary edema. However, the pathogenesis of this underlying comorbidity remains unclear. In this study, we utilized the 5-day-old BALB/c mouse model of lethal CVA2 infection to evaluate lung damage. We found that the permeability of lung microvascular was significantly increased after CVA2 infection. We also observed the direct infection and apoptosis of lung endothelial cells as well as the destruction of tight junctions between endothelial cells. CVA2 infection led to the degradation of tight junction proteins (e.g., ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin). The gene transcription levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF), endothelin (ET), thrombomodulin (THBD), granular membrane protein 140 (GMP140), and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) related to endothelial dysfunction were all significantly increased. Additionally, CVA2 infection induced the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, and MCP-1) and the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). In conclusion, the disruption of the endothelial barrier contributes to acute lung injury induced by CVA2 infection; targeting p38-MAPK signaling may provide a therapeutic approach for pulmonary edema in critical infections of HFMD.","Ji, Wangquan; Hu, Qiang; Zhang, Mengdi; Zhang, Chuwen; Chen, Chen; Yan, Yujie; Zhang, Xue; Chen, Shuaiyin; Tao, Ling; Zhang, Weiguo; Jin, Yuefei; Duan, Guangcai",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8467819/,427

By integrating the three indicators using the local indicator of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) statistic, this chapter intends to develop a novel approach for evaluating spatial-temporal relationships with different risk patterns in the 2002 dengue epidemic, the worst outbreak in the past sixty years. With this approach, not only are hypotheses generated through the mapping processes in furthering investigation, but also procedures provided to identify spatial health risk levels with temporal characteristics.","Wen, Tzai-hung; Lin, Neal H; Lin, Katherine Chun-min; Fan, I-chun; Su, Ming-daw; King, Chwan-chuen",GIS for Health and the Environment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121663/,427

Bij verkoudheid of griep is er vrijwel uitsluitend sprake van een virusinfectie. Slechts een deel van de verwekkers is bekend: influenzavirussen, para-influenzavirussen, adenovirussen en rinovirussen. Zo veroorzaken rinovirusinfecties vooral ontstekingsverschijnselen van het neusslijmvlies. Zij geven meestal weinig algemene ziekteverschijnselen. Adenovirusinfecties beginnen met keelpijn en neusirritatie en worden vaak vergezeld van bronchitis, terwijl koorts en algemene malaise als regel vanaf het begin aanwezig zijn. Infecties door influenzavirus uiten zich meestal door ernstige algemene symptomen (koorts, spierpijn, ‘doodziek’), terwijl lokale ziekteverschijnselen (keelpijn, hoest) op de achtergrond staan of zelfs achterwege kunnen blijven. Virale luchtweginfecties doen zich vooral voor in het najaar (vanaf september) en in het voorjaar (tot april).

Existing similarity measures either consider only the co-rated items for a pair of users (but co-rated items are rare in real-world sparse datasets), or try to utilize the non-co-rated items via some heuristics. We propose a novel user distance measure, called Preference Mover’s Distance (PMD), based on the optimal transportation theory. PMD exploits all ratings made by each user and works even if users do not share co-rated items at all. In addition, PMD is a metric and has favorable properties such as triangle inequality and zero self-distance. Experimental results show that PMD achieves superior recommendation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art similarity measures, especially on highly sparse datasets.","Meng, Yitong; Dai, Xinyan; Yan, Xiao; Cheng, James; Liu, Weiwen; Guo, Jun; Liao, Benben; Chen, Guangyong",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148039/,427

Existing works evaluate the style transfer models based on content preservation and transfer strength. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning based framework that directly rewards the framework on these target metrics yielding a better transfer of the target style. We show the improved performance of our proposed framework based on automatic and human evaluation on three independent tasks: wherein we transfer the style of text from formal to informal, high excitement to low excitement, modern English to Shakespearean English, and vice-versa in all the three cases.

Several of these enzymes are common components of replication complexes of other plus-strand RNA viruses, such as picornavirus 3C-like protease, papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RNA helicase, and ribose 2′-O-methyltransferase activities, while others such as exoribonuclease, endoribonuclease, and adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1″-phosphatase activities, are rarely or not conserved in viruses outside the order Nidovirales. The latter enzymes are believed to be involved in unique metabolic pathways used by coronaviruses to (1) replicate and transcribe their extremely large RNA genomes, and (2) interfere with cellular functions and antiviral host responses. Since the global outbreak of SARS in 2003, major efforts have been made to elucidate the structures of the protein components of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex. Thus, in less than 5 years, the structures of as many as 16 SARS-CoV proteins or functional domains have been determined. Remarkably, eight of these 16 structures had novel folds, illustrating the uniqueness of the coronavirus replicative machinery. Furthermore, several new protein functions and potential drug targets have been identified in these studies. Current structural studies mainly focus on the few remaining proteins for which no structural information is available and larger protein complexes comprised of different nsps. The studies aim at obtaining detailed information on the functions and macromolecular assembly of the coronavirus replication/transcription machinery which, over a long period of time, may be used to develop selective antiviral drugs. This chapter reviews structural information on the SARS-CoV macro domain (ADRP) as well as nsps 7, 8, 9, and 15 and summarizes our current knowledge of active-site residues and intermolecular interactions of these proteins.","Imbert, Isabelle; Ulferts, Rachel; Ziebuhr, John; Canard, Bruno",Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176173/,427

Patients at risk are elderly people and those with comorbidity. Early studies done on Chinese patients who suggest cytokine storm to be responsible for lung injury. We need to understand the mechanism of modulating such robust response of immunity and resultant cytokine storm. We suggest nicotinamide, a potential poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, as a supportive treatment for the prevention of cytokine storm from injuring the lung parenchyma. Nicotinamide supplementation albeit at high dose may modulate outcome in COVID-19. Nicotinamide was used previously to reduce ventilator-induced lung injury and lung injury due to hypoxia. Nicotinamide congeners are used to treat chronic lung disease like tuberculosis. Certainly, nicotinamide is effective pharmacotherapy in lung injury – whether acute or chronic. Other measures used in treating COVID-19 are focusing on targeting interleukin-6 – a cytokine responsible for mayhem, while few are targeting granulocyte-macrophage colony- stimulating factor. We suggest targeting PARP in addition to other measures to block cytokines. By inhibiting PARP course of COVID-19 may be altered. Understanding the pathophysiology of acute lung injury is crucial. PARP plays a pivotal role on cytokine release in response to any lung injury ranging from viral infection to hypoxia.

34010,Editorial note,2020-06-08,"Analogical proportions, often denoted [Formula: see text], are statements of the form “A is to B as C is to D” that involve comparisons between items. They are at the basis of an inference mechanism that has been recognized as a suitable tool for classification and has led to a variety of analogical classifiers in the last decade. Given an object D to be classified, the basic idea of such classifiers is to look for triples of examples (A, B, C), in the learning set, that form an analogical proportion with D, on a maximum set of attributes. In the context of classification, objects A, B, C and D are assumed to be represented by vectors of feature values. Analogical inference relies on the fact that if a proportion [Formula: see text] is valid, one of the four components of the proportion can be computed from the three others. Based on this principle, analogical classifiers have a cubic complexity due to the search for all possible triples in a learning set to make a single prediction. A special case of analogical proportions involving only three items A, B and C are called continuous analogical proportions and are of the form “A is to B as B is to C” (hence denoted [Formula: see text]). In this paper, we develop a new classification algorithm based on continuous analogical proportions and applied to numerical features. Focusing on pairs rather than triples, the proposed classifier enables us to compute an unknown midpoint item B given a pair of items (A, C). Experimental results of such classifier show an efficiency close to the previous analogy-based classifier while maintaining a reduced quadratic complexity.","Essid, Marouane; Bounhas, Myriam; Prade, Henri",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274341/,427

Skin lesions are assessed by dermatologists based on a number of factors. In the literature, the asymmetry of lesions appears recurrently since it may indicate irregular growth. We aim at developing an automatic algorithm that can detect symmetry in skin lesions, as well as indicating the axes of symmetry. We tackle this task based on skin lesions’ shape, based on their color and texture, and based on their combination. To do so, we consider symmetry axes through the center of mass, random forests classifiers to aggregate across different orientations, and a purposely-built dataset to compare textures that are specific of dermoscopic imagery. We obtain 84–88% accuracy in comparison with samples manually labeled as having either 1-axis symmetry, 2-axes symmetry or as being asymmetric. Besides its diagnostic value, the symmetry of a lesion also explains the reasons that might support such diagnosis. Our algorithm does so by indicating how many axes of symmetry were found, and by explicitly computing them.","Toureau, Vincent; Bibiloni, Pedro; Talavera-Martínez, Lidia; González-Hidalgo, Manuel",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274343/,427

The concept of product extension of two basic assignments is generalized (via operator of composition) to a finite sequence of basic assignments. This makes possible not only to express the extension, if it exists, in a closed form, but also enables us to find the sufficient condition for the existence of an extension of evidential marginal problem.

In this work we analyze the impact of so-called structure guidance for learning based registration when additional segmentation information is provided to a neural network. We present a novel weakly supervised deep learning based method for multi-modal 3D deformable CT-CBCT registration with structure guidance constraints. Our method is not supervised by ground-truth deformations and we use the energy functional of a variational registration approach as loss for training. Incorporating structure guidance constraints in our learning based approach results in an average Dice score of [Formula: see text] compared to a score of [Formula: see text] for the same method without constraints. An iterative registration approach with structure guidance results in a comparable average Dice score of [Formula: see text]. However, learning based registration requires only a single pass through the network, yielding computation of a deformation fields in less than 0.1 s which is more than 100 times faster than the runtime of iterative registration.","Kuckertz, Sven; Papenberg, Nils; Honegger, Jonas; Morgas, Tomasz; Haas, Benjamin; Heldmann, Stefan",Biomedical Image Registration,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7279938/,427

It combines the notions of feeling good and functioning effectively in a neighbourhood social environment in an indicator set of 15 conceptual dimensions. An online questionnaire was used to measure neighbourhood thriving (NT) among 212 pro-social volunteers involved in revitalising neighbourhoods in the UK city of Stoke-on-Trent between May and October 2018. Exploratory factor analysis revealed 11 factors that made conceptual sense including three social epidemiological pathways to well-being, networks, participation and pro-social behaviours, and four criteria for flourishing societies, autonomous citizenship, safety, cohesive communities and resilience. The 11 sub-scales of NT showed satisfactory internal consistency reliability and preliminary evidence of construct validity. The sub-scales were used tentatively to examine NT among the volunteer sample, which showed the highest sub-scale score for Positive Regard and the lowest score for Celebration. Different levels of NT were observed among the community, with age and income positively associated with higher levels of NT. Further validation work is needed before the NT scales can be used with confidence. Validated scales offer potential benefits including: measuring NT pre- and -post project implementation; establishing which dimensions of NT are, and are not, working well in a community and need strengthening through further initiatives, and establishing which specific groups of people are experiencing lower levels of NT and designing projects that meet their needs.

Although a lot of effort is devoted to practical algorithms for polytopes given as an intersection of halfspaces, there is no such method for zonotopes. Our algorithm is based on Multiphase Monte Carlo (MMC) methods, and our main contributions include: (i) a new uniform sampler employing Billiard Walk for the first time in volume computation, (ii) a new simulated annealing generalizing existing MMC by making use of adaptive convex bodies which fit to the input, thus drastically reducing the number of phases. Extensive experiments on zonotopes show our algorithm requires sub-linear number of oracle calls in the dimension, while the best theoretical bound is cubic. Moreover, our algorithm can be easily generalized to any convex body. We offer an open-source, optimized C++ implementation, and analyze its performance. Our code tackles problems intractable so far, offering the first efficient algorithm for zonotopes which scales to high dimensions (e.g. one hundred dimensions in less than 1 h).","Chalkis, Apostolos; Emiris, Ioannis Z.; Fisikopoulos, Vissarion",Mathematical Software - ICMS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7340933/,427

In this information era, digital media has turned out to be the most common medium of social life with the content of communication shifting from text-centered ones to interactive multimedia forms of images and videos. Mingling in the Nature, human society and the virtual world, digital media is developing rapidly with dazzling new concepts and technologies such as new media, We Media, and media convergence. Digital media has its unique tool in creation which is further fortified by computer and network technology at the aim of comprehensive artistic interaction. Hence a variety of VR, AR, and H5 are being widely used. The nature of tourism activities is the interaction between people and nature. The development of society and the improvement of people’s living standards have gradually increased the proportion of tourism activities in people’s daily lives. Tourists have a strong dependence on information. Whether it is communication or expression, the traditional tourism industry cannot meet the needs of the public. The combination of the fastest growing digital media and the broadest travel culture will inevitably produce unique and fascinating products. In view of the characteristics of digital media and modern tourism, the relationship between them is mutually reinforcing and inseparable. The promotion, promotion and implementation of tourism are inseparable from digital media. Every step of social development is driven by innovation and demands. Digital media and tourism are entering into the era of individuality, both complimenting, incorporating, and improving for mutual success and representing a vigorous and promising prospect for us.","Feng, Wei; Wang, Peng","Design, User Experience, and Usability",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7347412/,427

The high phenotypic plasticity typical of sessile, substrate-attached marine species may enhance their chances of survival and spread in a new region. Anthropogenic activities have changed marine habitats over a wide range of phenomena, including water temperature, community species composition, and the types of available substrates, creating new physical and biotic regimes that may contribute to the potential for successful species introduction. Here we examine ten species of sea anemones that have been introduced outside of their native range, and elucidate specific characteristics that are common among globally introduced sea anemones. Various life history strategies enable these species to survive and flourish through transport, introduction, establishment and spread, leading to the successful colonization of a new geographic area. Considering life history strategies and weighing of vector potential, we suggest conditions that facilitate introduction of these species, and identify species of sea anemones that may be introduced in the future in the face of changing climate and increased anthropogenic activities.","Glon, Heather; Daly, Marymegan; Carlton, James T.; Flenniken, Megan M.; Currimjee, Zara",Biol Invasions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7429141/,427

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness and accuracy of alternative screening strategies to provide evidence for cervical cancer screening guidelines in China. METHODS: In total, 32,306 women were enrolled. The current screening with Cervista(®) high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) nongenotyping and cytology cotesting (Cervista(®) cotesting) was compared with PCR-reverse dot blot HR-HPV genotyping and cytology cotesting (PCR-RDB cotesting). All eligible participants were divided into Arm 1, in which both HR-HPV assays were performed, and Arms 2 and 3, in which the PCR-RDB HPV or Cervista(®) HR-HPV assay, respectively, was performed. Outcome indicators included the cases, sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), colposcopy referral rate and cost of identifying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2/3 or worse (CIN2+/CIN3+). RESULTS: Among the eligible participants, 18.4% were PCR-RDB HR-HPV-positive, while 16.9% were Cervista(®) HR-HPV-positive, which reflects good agreement (k = 0.73). PCR-RDB cotesting identified more CIN3+ cases than Cervista(®) cotesting in the first round of screening in Arm 1 (37 vs 32) and Arms 2/3 (252 vs 165). The sensitivity and NPV of PCR-RDB cotesting for identifying CIN3+ in Arm 1 (sensitivity: 94.9% vs 86.5%; NPV: 99.9% vs 99.7%) and Arms 2/3 (sensitivity: 95.1% vs 80.9%; NPV: 99.9% vs 99.6%) were higher than those of Cervista(®) cotesting, but the cost was similar. CONCLUSIONS: The PCR-RDB HR-HPV genotyping and Cervista(®) HR-HPV assay results were consistent. PCR-RDB cotesting possesses optimal cost-effectiveness for cervical cancer screening in China, which has the highest number of cases globally but low screening coverage.","Dong, Binhua; Chen, Lihua; Lin, Wenyu; Su, Yingying; Mao, Xiaodan; Pan, Diling; Ruan, Guanyu; Xue, Huifeng; Kang, Yafang; Sun, Pengming",Cancer Cell Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7453699/,427

During this time, the industry has faced financial loss, job insecurity and anxiety for the future of Australian music, thus placing unprecedented strain on an industry already characterised by poor mental health. We identify four key narratives communicated by the media, which we call (1) acknowledging grief and loss, (2) supporting creativity and well-being, (3) adapting to the new normal and (4) envisaging a post-pandemic future.

Equine piroplasmosis represents a serious challenge to the equine industry due to important economic losses worldwide. The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of Theileria equi and Babesia caballi infections in equids from Jilin Province, China. METHODS: A total of 220 blood samples (192 horses and 28 donkeys/mules) were collected from March 2018 to October 2019 in five districts of Jilin Province and analyzed by PCR. Potential risk factors, including the region, sex, management, and host species of the animals were assessed in relation to T. equi infection. Moreover, the V4 hypervariable region of the T. equi 18S rRNA gene was analyzed to identify specific genotypes. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of T. equi in equids was 27.7%, whereas B. caballi infection was not identified. The district with the highest positive rate was Baicheng (43.3%), followed by Tonghua (28.9%), Yanbian (26.4%), Jilin (23.3%), and Liaoyuan (20.9%). The sex of the animals and farm management were identified as main risk factors, which were significantly associated with the prevalence of Equine piroplasmosis (P < 0.05). The risk factor analysis indicated that the females were at a higher risk (OR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.17–5.27) of being infected compared to the males, whereas the organized farm was protective factor (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.22–0.80). The phylogenetic analyses revealed that there were two T. equi genotypes (A and E) in Jilin. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provided important epidemiological data for the prevention and control of T. equi infection in Jilin, China.

40819,A Call to Action for 2021,2020-10-15,"Spatiotemporally ordered production of cells is essential for brain development. Normally, most undifferentiated neural progenitor cells (NPCs) face the apical (ventricular) surface of embryonic brain walls. Pathological detachment of NPCs from the apical surface and their invasion of outer neuronal territories, i.e., formation of NPC heterotopias, can disrupt the overall structure of the brain. Although NPC heterotopias have previously been observed in a variety of experimental contexts, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Yes-associated protein 1 (Yap1) and the TEA domain (Tead) proteins, which act downstream of Hippo signaling, enhance the stem-like characteristics of NPCs. Elevated expression of Yap1 or Tead in the neural tube (future spinal cord) induces massive NPC heterotopias, but Yap/Tead-induced expansion of NPCs in the developing brain has not been previously reported to produce NPC heterotopias. To determine whether NPC heterotopias occur in a regionally characteristic manner, we introduced the Yap1-S112A or Tead-VP16 into NPCs of the telencephalon and diencephalon, two neighboring but distinct forebrain regions, of embryonic day 10 mice by in utero electroporation, and compared NPC heterotopia formation. Although NPCs in both regions exhibited enhanced stem-like behaviors, heterotopias were larger and more frequent in the diencephalon than in the telencephalon. This result, the first example of Yap/Tead-induced NPC heterotopia in the forebrain, reveals that Yap/Tead-induced NPC heterotopia is not specific to the neural tube, and also suggests that this phenomenon depends on regional factors such as the three-dimensional geometry and assembly of these cells.","Saito, Kanako; Kawasoe, Ryotaro; Sasaki, Hiroshi; Kawaguchi, Ayano; Miyata, Takaki",Neurochem Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5756272/,427
40927,Transport geography in Iceland,2020-10-16,"This narrative review was conducted to synthesize and summarize available up-to-date evidence on current health status, including both non-communicable diseases and infectious diseases, of migrants and refugees from the former Soviet Union countries in the Russian Federation. Epidemiological and sociological studies with one or more determinants of the health, as well as relevant qualitative studies characterizing risk factors, well-being indicators, and lifestyles of migrants and refugees from the former Soviet Union countries in Russia published from 2004 to 2019 in Russian and English languages were included in the review. Despite significant limitations of the available research literature in the field, some patterns in migrants’ health in Russia and issues that need to be addressed were identified. In particular, the syndemic epidemics of communicable and non-communicable diseases, additively increasing negative health consequences, including cardiovascular diseases and chronic digestive system diseases, high rates of sexually transmitted infections and HIV, respiratory diseases and a growing percentage of new tuberculosis cases among migrants from the former Soviet Union countries are all of great concern. Possibly, the burden of these co-occurring morbidities is linked to commonly reported issues among this population group, such as poor nutrition and living conditions, high prevalence of unskilled manual labour, non-compliance with sanitary norms, lack of basic vaccinations, lack of basic knowledge about safe sexual practices and risky sexual behaviour, low healthcare seeking behaviour and limited access to health care. Importantly, these findings may urge the government to increase efforts and promote international collaboration in combating the threat of infectious diseases. Additionally, it was found that migrants had higher levels of anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, and those who stayed in the receiving country 5 years or more had a higher level of somatic pathology than those whose stay was less than 5 years. In order to ensure an adequate health system response and fulfil the main Universal Health Coverage principle of “leaving no one behind”, a robust monitoring system of the health status of refugees and migrants and an integrated legal framework for the standardized and more inclusive routine care for this population in Russia is urgently needed.","Bakunina, Nataliia; Gil, Artyom; Polushkin, Vitaly; Sergeev, Boris; Flores, Margarita; Toskin, Igor; Madyanova, Viktoriya; Khalfin, Ruslan",Int J Equity Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7552588/,427

We retrospectively included 120 patients 71 males (59.2%) and 49 females (40.8%) with a mean age of 47.2 ± 14.4 years. Patients subjected to clinical assessment, CBC, PCR for COVID-19, and non-contrast CT chest at first presentation. Typical and atypical imaging findings were reported and correlated with the clinical findings of the patients, the need for ICU admission, ventilation, and mortality. RESULTS: Clinically, fever was seen in 112 patients followed by dry cough in 108 patients and malaise in 35 patients. The final outcome was complete recovery in 113 cases and death in 7 cases. Typical CT findings included bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacities (GGO) in 74.7%, multilobar affection in 92.5% while atypical findings such as homogeneous consolidation, pleural effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and single lobar affection were found in 13.4, 5, 6.7, and 7.5% respectively. A statistically significant association between the presence of white lung, pleural effusion, peripheral GGO, and the need for ICU admission as well as mechanical ventilation was noted. The death was significantly higher among elderly patients; however, no significance was found between the imaging features and mortality. CONCLUSION: CT features at first presentation can predict the need for ICU admission and the need for ventilation but cannot predict the mortality outcome of the patients.","Emara, Doaa M.; Naguib, Nagy N.; Moustafa, M.

42150,How the pandemic taught us to turn smart beta into real alpha,2020-11-17,"The article seeks to reclaim a type of fear lost in silent omission in education, yet central to the development of an ethical subject. It distinguishes the fear described by Martin Heidegger through the concept of befindlichkeit and fear for the other as an essential moment for ethics articulated by Emmanuel Levinas. It argues that the latter conception of fear has inverted the traditional assumption of the ideal ethical subject as fearless. It then examines how Levinas’s interpretation of fear might contribute to the discussion on fear and responsibility in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It concludes that fear for the other reveals our tremendous capacity to suffer for the other, which is an aspect of the emotional life that has not been identified in the general educational discourse. This inattention manifests itself as a categorical omission in which the existence of fear for the other is not recognized and impedes the ability of educators to address ethics as it is deeply lived.","Yan, Sijin; Slattery, Patrick",Stud Philos Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7659423/,427

Challenges on the road to a post-growth future,2020-11-17,"The events that occurred after the worldwide diffusion of COVID‐19 provide a real‐life example of how uncertainty can severely affect the global economy. This paper reviews literature on the negative impacts of the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU) as developed by Baker et al., The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 2016, 131, 1593–1636 on individuals, businesses, governments, and economies at the local and international levels. This reveals that a high EPU is associated with adverse effects on households, corporations, and governments, which tend to delay many financial decisions under high uncertainty, which leads to lower consumption, fewer issuances of debt, fewer investments, and higher unemployment. The effects of political and regulatory uncertainty also extend to the commodity markets, such as the adverse effects on both oil and gasoline markets, and can potentially create adverse impacts on the crypto‐currency market and its potential growth. We demonstrate that governmental uncertainty also affects financial, housing, and equity markets; debt issuances; and the entire economy. This underscores the importance of considering EPU as a risk factor. The association with several components of the global economy reflects not only the EPU index's critical influence, but also the importance of risk management. Our results lead us to consider the gravity of economic policy uncertainty and call for innovation across different sectors to mitigate its adverse effects.","Al‐Thaqeb, Saud Asaad; Algharabali, Barrak Ghanim; Alabdulghafour, Khaled Tareq",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7675497/,427

These could be secondary infections derived from opportunistic bacteria on the skin or infections directly vectored by the spider. In this study, we investigated whether it is plausible for S. nobilis and other synanthropic European spiders to vector bacteria during a bite, by seeking to identify bacteria with pathogenic potential on the spiders. 11 genera of bacteria were identified through 16S rRNA sequencing from the body surfaces and chelicerae of S. nobilis, and two native spiders: Amaurobius similis and Eratigena atrica. Out of 22 bacterial species isolated from S. nobilis, 12 were related to human pathogenicity among which Staphylococcus epidermidis, Kluyvera intermedia, Rothia mucilaginosa and Pseudomonas putida are recognized as class 2 pathogens. The isolates varied in their antibiotic susceptibility: Pseudomonas putida, Staphylococcus capitis and Staphylococcus edaphicus showed the highest extent of resistance, to three antibiotics in total. On the other hand, all bacteria recovered from S. nobilis were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Our study demonstrates that S. nobilis does carry opportunistic pathogenic bacteria on its body surfaces and chelicerae. Therefore, some post-bite infections could be the result of vector-borne bacterial zoonoses that may be antibiotic resistant.","Dunbar, John P.; Khan, Neyaz A.; Abberton, Cathy L.; Brosnan, Pearce; Murphy, Jennifer; Afoullouss, Sam; O’Flaherty, Vincent; Dugon, Michel M.; Boyd, Aoife",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7708416/,427
43088,Exploring risk pooling in hospitals to reduce demand and lead time uncertainty,2020-12-11,"INTRODUCTION: Amidst the unprecedented nationwide ban on elective surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic, concern regarding timely and safe treatment of patients with intracranial tumors has been raised in the neuro-oncology community. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who underwent treatment for intracranial tumors from 3/12–7/1 for 2019 and 2020. Dates aligned with declaration of State of Emergency through the multi-phase public re-opening. Primary comparative endpoints included case volume, median time to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, and COVID-related mortality. RESULTS: Overall surgical case volume decreased by 26.6%, while a 46.9% decrease was evident during the ban on elective surgeries. Case reduction occurred only for glial (p= 0.33) and pituitary tumors (p=0.04) where volume was nearly identical for other tumors. Median time to surgery was 2.5 days (range: 0–9) for high-grade glioma patients, 3 days for metastases, 3 days for meningiomas, and 26 days (range: 0–98) for pituitary adenomas, not significantly different from 2019. Time to chemoradiation and planned number of treatments were without significant difference. Among 2,795 Covid-19 patients treated in our institution, only four had brain tumors. Only one patient experienced delayed radiation treatment (three weeks) due to inability to achieve seroconversion prior to planned simulation. Only one COVID-related mortality in our cohort occurred. DISCUSSION: The pandemic did not significantly delay type and time to treatment for neuro-oncology patients at Inova. With swift implementation of PPE and strict peri-operative testing, we provided standard of care treatment without increases in COVID-19 contraction or mortality. Decreases in overall case volume are likely due to ongoing cultural avoidance of seeking medical care; deferment of endonasal surgery may be attributed to a known greater mortality for ENT procedures. Future patient care challenges include establishing clinical significance of seroconversion for asymptomatic, COVID-19 infected patients without delaying necessary systemic treatment.","Dang, Danielle; Mugge, Luke; Awan, Omar; Gunnells, Emily; Vaughan, Megan; Ziu, Mateo",Neuro Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7650449/,427
43328,Intergenerational connections through technology: Insights from the Technology Use in Later Life multi-site study,2020-12-16,"Pathogenicity of Staphylococcus aureus is induced by staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). A mutant form of SEB (mSEB) is immunogenic as well as less toxic. Recombinant mSEB and SEB were expressed in pET28a prokaryotic plasmids. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in mSEB-stimulated macrophages were lower than those in SEB-stimulated macrophages (p < 0.001, p < 0.01 respectively). Using CotC as a fusion protein, we constructed recombinant Bacillus subtilis spores expressing mSEB on the spore surface and evaluated their safety and protective efficacy via mouse models. Oral administration of mSEB-expressing spores increased SEB-specific IgA in feces and SEB-specific IgG1 and IgG2a in the sera, compared with mice in naïve and CotC spore-treated groups (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, p < 0.001 respectively). Six weeks following oral dosing of recombinant spores, significant differences were not found in the serum biochemical indices between the mSEB group and the naïve and CotC groups. Furthermore, oral administration of mSEB spores increased the survival rate by 33.3% in mice intraperitoneally injected with 5 µg of wild-type SEB plus 25 µg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In summation, recombinant spores stably expressing mSEB were developed, and oral administration of such recombinant spores induced a humoral immune response and provided protection against SEB challenge in mice.","Xiong, Zhile; Mai, Jialiang; Li, Fei; Liang, Bingshao; Yao, Shuwen; Liang, Zhuwei; Zhang, Chao; Gao, Fei; Ai, Xiaolan; Wang, Jielin; Long, Yan; Yang, Min; Gong, Sitang; Zhou, Zhenwen",AMB Express,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734462/,427
43502,"Pandemic risk: Impact, modeling, and transfer",2020-11-26,"Objective measurement of physical function can be a more sensitive predictor of future disability and changes over time than self-report measures. However, objective measures require in-person assessments which can limit their use in hard-to-reach populations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratory assessment of physical functioning in our two large randomized controlled exercise trials in older adults with cancer was temporarily suspended. We adapted testing protocols for administering the short physical performance battery (PPB), including chair stand (CS; sec) and 4m usual walk (4MW; m/s) tests, and timed-up-and go (TUG; sec) tests of physical functioning for remote assessment by video conferencing technology. We report on interim assessments of inter and intra-rater reliability and validity against newly resumed in-person tests. Repeat assessments were conducted on the same participant 1-2 weeks apart, by the same assessor (intra-rater reliability) or by another assessor (inter-rater reliability) for remote visits and by the same assessor for in-person tests (validity). Pearson-product moment correlations are provided for PPB, CS, 4MW and TUG, in that order. Intra-rater reliability values are: 0.97, 0.88, 0.90, and 0.96; Inter-rater reliability values are: 0.79, 0.14, 0.40, and 0.99; Validity values (no TUG) are: 0.66, 0.81, 0.78. Reliability of conducting remote PPB by video is very high when using the same assessor, while TUG reliability is high within and between assessors. Remote PPB administration has a good correlation with in-person visits, but the two modes of delivery should not yet be used interchangeably in longitudinal studies until sources of error can be determined and minimized.","Winters-Stone, Kerri; Lipps, Colin; Guidarelli, Carolyn; Herrera-Fuentes, Pablo",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741140/,427
44454,Theorising Digital Tools: Mutual Constitution of the Person and Digital in a Conceptual PlayWorld,2021-01-11,"It is generally accepted that the primary goal of marketing, even conventional sustainable marketing, is to enhance organizations’ financial well-being, a view that is consistent with mainstream utilitarian ethics. However, this profit-first focus often inadvertently contributes to socio-ecological problems and undermines the ability of marketing to adequately address resulting challenges. This paper presents an approach to sustainable marketing that we call Social and Ecological Thought (SET) marketing, which is based on virtue ethics and aims to optimize social and ecological well-being while ensuring financial viability. We describe implications of SET marketing for each of the 4 Ps in the marketing-mix paradigm—product, price, place, and promotion—and compare them to conventional views based on mainstream utilitarian ethics. SET marketing is relevant for the growing number of consumers and businesses that willingly forgo the maximization of financial well-being in order to optimize socio-ecological well-being. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.","Dyck, Bruno; Manchanda, Rajesh V.",AMS Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7788387/,427

44608,A method based on Graph Theory and Three Way Decisions to evaluate critical regions in epidemic diffusion:: An analysis of COVID-19 in Italy,2021-01-15,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a worldwide public health problem. It is estimated that up to 80% of cases of ARIs are caused by viruses. In Central America, however, we identified few epidemiologic studies on the main ARI-related viruses in hospitalized children. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical charts of patients ages 29 days to 14 years admitted with diagnoses of ARIs in a pediatric reference hospital in central Panama during 2016. The variables analyzed were age, sex, signs, symptoms, and diagnosis at admission. Samples of patients to whom a viral panel was indicated were analyzed via quantitative polymerase chain reaction, qPCR. RESULTS: The most common virus was respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 25.9%), followed by influenza A virus (10.6%), rhinovirus (10.6%), parainfluenza type 3 (PIV-3; 8.2%) and adenovirus (5.9%). However, virus detection varied with patient age and season. RSV and Influenza virus were respectively identified mainly during July–November and May–July. All cases of viral co-infection occurred in children < 5-years-old. Both influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 and rhinovirus were detected in all pediatric ages analyzed in this study, unlike RSV and PIV-3, which were only present in children < 5-years-old. CONCLUSIONS: This study analyzed the epidemiological patterns of different respiratory viruses in pediatric patients with ARI from central Panama and found that the prevalence of the specific respiratory viruses identified varied with season and age. The most common viruses were RSV, influenza A, and rhinovirus. There were no reports of human metapneumovirus associated with ARI, which may be explained by the time and geographic location of the study. Knowledge of the local epidemiology of respiratory viruses in tropical countries is helpful in forecasting the peaks of hospitalizations due to ARIs and may help improve prevention efforts aiming at respiratory disease control in these settings.","Núñez-Samudio, Virginia; Landires, Iván",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7796567/,427
44633,Market Shocks in the G7 Countries,2021-01-16,"BACKGROUND: Ebola virus disease (EVD) is an often-fatal infection where the effectiveness of medical countermeasures is uncertain. During the West African outbreak (2013–2016), several patients were treated with different types of anti-viral therapies including monoclonal antibody-based cocktails that had the potential to neutralise Ebola virus (EBOV). However, at the time, the efficacy of these therapies was uncertain. Given the scale of the outbreak, several clinical phenotypes came to the forefront including the ability of the same virus to cause recrudescence in the same patient—perhaps through persisting in immune privileged sites. Several key questions remained including establishing if monoclonal antibody therapy was effective in humans with severe EVD, whether virus escape mutants were selected during treatment, and what is the potential mechanism(s) of persistence. This was made possible through longitudinal samples taken from a UK patient with EVD. METHODS: Several different sample types, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, were collected and sequenced using Illumina-based RNAseq. Sequence reads were mapped both to EBOV and the human genome and differential gene expression analysis used to identify changes in the abundance of gene transcripts as infection progressed. Digital Cell Quantitation analysis was used to predict the immune phenotype in samples derived from blood. RESULTS: The findings were compared to equivalent data from West African patients. The study found that both virus and host markers were predictive of a fatal outcome. This suggested that the extensive supportive care, and most likely the application of the medical countermeasure ZMab (a monoclonal antibody cocktail), contributed to survival of the UK patient. The switch from progression to a ‘fatal’ outcome to a ‘survival’ outcome could be seen in both the viral and host markers. The UK patient also suffered a recrudescence infection 10 months after the initial infection. Analysis of the sequencing data indicated that the virus entered a period of reduced or minimal replication, rather than other potential mechanisms of persistence—such as defective interfering genomes. CONCLUSIONS: The data showed that comprehensive supportive care and the application of medical countermeasures are worth pursuing despite an initial unfavourable prognosis.","Bosworth, Andrew; Rickett, Natasha Y.; Dong, Xiaofeng; Ng, Lisa F.

44899,"A Review of IRS-1C Applications in Urban and Regional Studies, and Infrastructure Planning",2021-01-24,"Obesity-related kidney diseases are becoming serious health problems worldwide, yet the mechanism by which obesity causes kidney injury is not fully understood. The purpose of current study was to investigate the role of Mas receptor in lipid-induced kidney injury. In mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD), the protein abundance of markers of autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and apoptosis was dramatically increased in the kidney cortex, which was markedly prevented by Mas deletion (Mas(−/−)) or Mas receptor antagonist A779. Palmitic acid (PA) induced persistently increased autophagy, ER stress, and apoptosis as well as mitochondrial injuries in primary cultured proximal tubular cells from wild type, but not from Mas(−/−) mice. In human proximal tubular HK2 cells, PA-induced autophagy and ER stress was aggravated by Mas agonists Ang (1–7) or AVE0991, but attenuated by A779 or Mas knockdown. Stimulation of Mas resulted in elevated intracellular calcium levels [Ca(2+)](i) in HK2 cells treated with PA, whereas inhibition or knockdown of Mas decreased [Ca(2+)](i). Mitochondrial outer membrane located voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1) was markedly upregulated in HK2 cells treated with PA, which was associated with impaired mitochondrial morphology and depolarization. These were enhanced by AVE0991 and suppressed by A779 or Mas knockdown. Mas knockdown in HK2 cells prevented impaired interactions among VDAC1, autophagy adaptor P62, and ubiquitin, induced by PA, leading to a potential ubiquitination of VDAC1. In conclusion, Mas receptor-mediated lipid-induced impaired autophagy and ER stress in the kidney, likely contributing to tubular injuries in obesity-related kidney diseases.","Kong, Yonglun; Zhao, Xiaoduo; Qiu, Miaojuan; Lin, Yu; Feng, Pinning; Li, Suchun; Liang, Baien; Zhu, Qing; Huang, Hui; Li, Chunling; Wang, Weidong",Cell Death Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7817966/,427

45046,A Real Chance for the Transatlantic Partnership on Climate Policy,2021-01-26,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The main aims of fragrances are to create pleasing scents or to mask unpleasant odors. We hereby review their main exposure sources, presumed benefits, and unwanted effects, with special attention to allergic contact dermatitis (prevalence, regulatory environment, risk assessment methodology, and preventive measures). RECENT FINDINGS: Fragrances elicit positive emotions and presumably have therapeutic benefits related to stress reduction and memory enhancement. However, they also cause detrimental health or environmental effects including contact dermatitis (irritant and/or allergic), non-eczematous contact reactions, photosensitivity, photo-allergy, and immediate contact reactions, which can negatively impact the quality of life. Fragrances are the most frequent chemicals causing contact dermatitis. Their main sources are cosmetics, household products, industrial substances, food flavorings, oral hygiene products, and topical medications. It is difficult for sensitized patients to avoid contact with fragrances, due to their ubiquity and because manufacturers are not willing to volunteer information regarding fragrance ingredients. SUMMARY: The treatment of contact dermatitis relies on allergens avoidance which does not “cure” the disease (sensitization persists for life) but prevents disabling illness. The patient should understand that avoiding perfume means to avoid all scented goods and not just perfumes. Labeling fragrances is key in primary prevention (by giving the healthy individual the chance to make an informed choice to avoid risky substances), diagnosis (by helping the practitioner to plan and interpret patch tests), secondary prevention, and prognosis (by allowing the sensitized patient to follow the avoidance instructions). However, only 26 fragrances are mandatory to be declared in cosmetics. The vague labeling of other fragrance ingredients as “perfume” or “fragrance” hampers the diagnostic and preventive approaches. Therefore, in our opinion, declaration should be mandatory for all fragrance ingredients as well as straightforward so most consumers can understand it. Moreover, legislation should be improved to prevent inappropriately high exposures by forbidding stronger allergens, restricting maximum concentrations in the finished product or fields of application, delivering information regarding the risks to the general public, and controlling the compliance of manufacturers with the regulations. Besides, manufacturers should share information regarding the composition in the final products and provide physicians with samples of all fragrance chemicals whenever needed for patch test investigations.","Pastor-Nieto, María-Antonia; Gatica-Ortega, María-Elena",Curr Treat Options Allergy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7825391/,427

Their rights and access to basic life-saving services are impacted by their forced movement and its resulting, often prolonged, displacement. Durable solutions are also less prioritised in displacement management. Though a legal framework on disaster governance exists, it lacked a human rights perspective that could integrate human rights standards into humanitarian support. With the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spreading in the country, IDPs are at a higher risk of contracting the disease due to inadequate shelter conditions. As the government battles both the spread of the virus and the need to restart the economy in a post-COVID-19 pandemic scenario, IDPs must be included in the national and local frameworks for recovery. This article discusses the situation of IDPs in the Philippines and looks into the policy gaps that limit opportunities for effective displacement management. It also surfaces human rights issues that must be addressed by the government in its socio-economic revival agenda and discusses the accountability of state actors in providing opportunities for IDPs to achieve durable solutions.

47871,Surveillance and the Impossible Search for Ideal Behaviour,2020-07-23,"Scene query is an important problem for the visually impaired population. While existing systems are able to recognize objects surrounding a person, one of their significant shortcomings is that they typically rely on the phone camera with a finite field of view. Therefore, if the object is situated behind the user, it will go undetected unless the user spins around and takes a series of pictures. The recent introduction of affordable, panoramic cameras solves this problem. In addition, most existing systems report all “significant” objects in a given scene to the user, rather than respond to a specific user-generated query as to where an object located. The recent introduction of text-to-speech and speech recognition capabilities on mobile phones paves the way for such user-generated queries, and for audio response generation to the user. In this paper, we exploit the above advancements to develop a query system for the visually impaired utilizing a panoramic camera and a smartphone. We propose three designs for such a system: the first is a handheld device, and the second and third are wearable backpack and ring. In all three cases, the user interacts with our systems verbally regarding whereabouts of objects of interest. We exploit deep learning methods to train our system to recognize objects of interest.

48598,COVID-19 and the Big Oil Price Crash: Exploring the Anatomy,2021-01-16,"BACKGROUND: Given the social distancing measures employed to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, tele-health has rapidly expanded and is now routinely used in new patient encounters and in follow up appointments across Canada. AIMS: To determine the patient and physician perspective towards tele-health in a gastroenterology outpatient setting. METHODS: An anonymous voluntary online survey was distributed to patients who had previously undergone at least one tele-health visit in a tertiary care gastroenterology outpatient setting. A separate online survey was distributed to gastroenterologists practising across Canada. RESULTS: A total of 181 patients from British Columbia (59.8% female) completed the survey. The tele-health appointment was the first visit for 21.8% of patients. Appointments occurred by phone call alone (61.4%) or by video and audio software (38.6%) and started within 5 minutes of the scheduled time in 75% of visits. Patient satisfaction with the tele-health visit was high (8.54 on a scale of 0–10; 0 completely dissatisfied, 10 extremely satisfied; IQR 8–10). Most patients did not perceive a difference in likelihood of compliance compared to a non-tele-health visit (90.6%), were not concerned about the lack of physical exam during a tele-health visit (82.4%) and did not with-hold information they would have revealed in person (88.7%). After the COVID-19 pandemic, some patients would prefer tele-heath visits (39.2%), whereas others would prefer in office visits (28.5%) and the remainder were indifferent (32.3%). Post-pandemic, most patients would prefer tele-health for follow up visits (68.4%), over tele-health for all possible visits (27.9%) or no tele-health visits (3.8%). A total of 25 Canadian gastroenterologists (28.0% female; 60% academic practice, 40% community practice) completed a separate survey. Regarding the lack of physical exam in tele-health, 44% of physicians believed this did not affect the quality of their assessment, whereas some physicians believed it had either minimally (48%) or greatly (8%) impaired the quality of their assessment. Almost all physicians (96%) perceived that patients either appreciate tele-health as much as or more than in office visits. Post-pandemic, most physicians (96%) supported a hybrid model of both tele-health and in office visits. Appointments for follow up of benign endoscopic pathology results (96%), follow up visits (92%), consultations prior to endoscopy (76%) were deemed to be most appropriate for tele-health. Follow up of malignant pathology results (24%) and consultations for new patients (32%) were thought to be less appropriate for tele-health visits. CONCLUSIONS: Patient and physician satisfaction with tele-health in a Canadian outpatient gastroenterology setting is high. Most patients and physicians wish for tele-health to remain available in the post-pandemic setting.

Machine learning is of great value in this context because it provides techniques - called unsupervised - that are applicable to unlabelled datasets. Objective: This study aims at comparing various approaches employed over the years on unlabelled datasets to predict the defective modules, i.e. the ones which need more attention in the testing phase. Our comparison is based on the measurement of performance metrics and on the real defective information derived from software archives. Our work leverages a new dataset that has been obtained by extracting and preprocessing its metrics from a C++ software. Method: Our empirical study has taken advantage of CLAMI with its improvement CLAMI+ that we have applied on high energy physics software datasets. Furthermore, we have used clustering techniques such as the K-means algorithm to find potentially critical modules. Results: Our experimental analysis have been carried out on 1 open source project with 34 software releases. We have applied 17 ML techniques to the labelled datasets obtained by following the CLAMI and CLAMI+ approaches. The two approaches have been evaluated by using different performance metrics, our results show that CLAMI+ performs better than CLAMI. The predictive average accuracy metric is around 95% for 4 ML techniques (4 out of 17) that show a Kappa statistic greater than 0.80. We applied K-means on the same dataset and obtained 2 clusters labelled according to the output of CLAMI and CLAMI+.

Existing research in this emerging field of “gayborhood studies” emphasizes macro-structural explanatory variables, including the economy (e.g., land values, urban governance, growth machine politics, affordability, and gentrification), culture (e.g., public opinions, societal acceptance, and assimilation), and technology (e.g., geo-coded mobile apps, online dating services). In this chapter, I use the residential logics of queer people—why they in their own words say that they live in a gay district—to show how gayborhoods acquire their significance on the streets. By shifting the analytic gaze from abstract concepts to interactions and embodied perceptions on the ground—a “street empirics” as I call it—I challenge the claim that gayborhoods as an urban form are outmoded or obsolete. More generally, my findings caution against adopting an exclusively supra-individual approach in urban studies. The reasons that residents provide for why their neighborhoods appeal to them showcase the analytic power of the streets for understanding what places mean and why they matter.","Ghaziani, Amin",The Life and Afterlife of Gay Neighborhoods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978650/,427

Acute respiratory infections (ARI) in infant, children, and adolescent age group are common incidence in India and worldwide. ARI need special care and knowledge from physicians to diagnose the exact pathology. It is sometimes very challenging to cure. In the intrauterine (fetal) life, gaseous exchange of oxygen and carbon-di-oxide does not occur in lungs as the placenta helps in exchange process. After birth hypoxia, temperature fluctuations, hypercapnia, and sensitivities of chemoreceptor play important role in breathing. With increasing age, there is expansion in lung volume, multiplication of alveoli and vessels for better and improved lung ventilation. The patients can be presented with cough (irritation of pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and pleura), rattling (due to excessive secretion in trachea-bronchial pathway), wheezing (audible whistling sound), stridor (upper respiratory obstruction by hoarseness, retraction of chest), tachypnea (abnormally rapid respiration), and dyspnea (difficult breathing). As the children cannot expectorate smoothly, there are always higher chances of lower respiratory tract infections like bronchiolitis, pneumonia, lung abscess, etc. These infections have to be diagnosed properly with blood investigations: pulmonary functions test (PFT), bronchoscopy, and imaging (X-ray or CT scan) techniques. Arterial blood gas analysis with supportive and definitive line of management is always crucial. Serial estimation of C-reactive protein (CRP) can guide the true recovery or deteriorating phases of infections in cumulative disease conditions apart from viable signs and symptoms.","Das, Chandra Shekhar",Clinical Significance of C-reactive Protein,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978724/,427

It argues, among others, that China’s comparative strength does not simply lie in its importance in world trade of manufacturing produce and the surplus it generates. The crucial strategic substratum of China’s ascendance has been the role of the Chinese state in guiding the country’s development inside and outside China proper. Further, the Chinese state controls the production of rare earth elements (europium, gadolinium, dysprosium, terbium etc.), which allow China to bid for a monopolistic position in global political economy undermining head-on America’s primacy in digitisation, nanotechnology, biotechnology, electronics and cyber-security.","Fouskas, Vassilis K.; Roy-Mukherjee, Shampa; Huang, Qingan; Udeogu, Ejike",China & the USA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978862/,427

However, the analysis of contact points across sectors shows that they are intertwined in a variety of ways. The co-existence of these sectors is often taken for granted in host communities, until new oil exploration or extraction infringes on established tourism economies. This provokes conflict between different ways of valuing non-human nature and integrating it into social-ecological relationships and political economies. Furthermore, climate change transforms the social-ecological context of the North Atlantic. This has significant implications for the oil-tourism interface because it raises issues about decoupling eco-tourism from fossil fuel resource extraction and highlights the need for decarbonization in both sectors.","Stoddart, Mark C.

However, this represents a challenge after the first consultation because many parents present problems of time to attend the controls in the office, in addition to lack of tools to support monitoring from home, thus causing a high rate of dropout. There are telemonitoring applications for people with obesity that send data in real time, but they are focused on adults; they do not consider pediatric patients or their parents as agents of change. For this reason, TCO is presented as a mobile application for telemonitoring and control of overweight and obesity in pediatric patients, which facilitates the specialist in the communication, follow-up, and orientation of their patients through family members or caregivers, considering anthropometric indicators, automatic monitoring through rules, prescription of the food plan, and recommendation of foods and dishes of the season and region. A case study was carried out with two groups of 16 overweight and obese pediatric patients, one of them using TCO. The results show that the dropout rate was reduced by 38%, and both body mass index and average waist circumference improved by 4% and 3%, respectively. In addition, family members who did not dropout were surveyed, and satisfaction was obtained between “High” and “Very High” in the use of the application as an aid to monitoring and compliance with treatment.","Huapaya, Diana; Marin, Diego; Mauricio, David","Advances and Applications in Computer Science, Electronics and Industrial Engineering",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978932/,427

Effective targeting of tumor cells without accompanying toxicity has started to be realized with the introduction of signal transduction therapies and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Small molecule examples of the former drugs include imatinib (which inhibits both the ABL and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinases); gefitinib and erlotinib; mTOR inhibitors; histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs); all-trans retinoic acid (tRA) and arsenic trioxide that target PML; the synthetic retinoic X receptor agonist bexarotene for T cell lymphoma; some hormone therapies; and proteosome inhibitors including bortezomib and carfilzomib. For most of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting EGFRs, papulopustular rash, hand-foot skin reaction, mucositis, and nail abnormalities are the main adverse events. Retinoic acid syndrome occurs in some patients treated with tRA and/or arsenic trioxide. mTOR inhibitors are associated with a considerable number of adverse events including interstitial lung disease. Myelosuppression is a frequent event with HDACIs, and bortezomib, a proteosome inhibitor, may cause gastrointestinal symptoms, thrombocytopenia, peripheral neuropathy, and adverse cutaneous reactions including Sweet’s syndrome. Of the 85 currently approved mAbs, 34 recognizing 21 different targets are indicated for the treatment of cancers. Seven mAbs are antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) which effect cell killing by an attached bioactive payload of a potentially lethal toxin, drug, cytokine, or radionuclide. Immune checkpoint inhibitors target inhibitory pathways regulating signaling between T cells and antigen-presenting cells. mAbs may provoke type I immediate hypersensitivities (anaphylaxis, urticaria), types II (rituximab-induced neutropenia) and III hypersensitivities (serum sickness), delayed type IV cutaneous reactions, pulmonary toxicities, and cardiac adverse events. Skin reactions after cetuximab and panitumumab often appear as papulopustular eruptions. Severe infusion reactions provoked by mAbs can resemble anaphylaxis, cytokine-release syndrome (CRS), infusion, and type I allergic reactions, while tumor lysis syndrome, unlike CRS, is easy to distinguish from type I immediate reactions.","Baldo, Brian A.; Pham, Nghia H.",Drug Allergy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979054/,427

The majority of police forces find it difficult to fulfil their responsibilities in this regard in the face of constrained funding, a lack of awareness and training amongst law enforcement staff, the growing number of cybercrime incidences, and outdated or insufficient technology and infrastructure. Even if police forces are able to install technical controls to counter cyber threats, their staff members’ cyber behaviour may be a weak link in the cybersecurity chain and will probably not have sufficient training. The cultivation of a cybersecurity culture has been shown to be the best approach to address human behaviour in the cyber domain. There are several frameworks and other resources available for an organisation to cultivate a cybersecurity culture but the organisational culture in law enforcement agencies is different than that in other organisations. The cyber behaviour, cybercrime investigation skills, training and education of police force members require customised strategies and research. African police forces find it particularly difficult to deal with these challenges due to a lack of funding and a shortage of cybersecurity capability and capacity. This paper presents guidelines for African police forces to formulate strategies and plans to train and educate their members and to foster an organisational cybersecurity and cybercrime combatting culture.","Leenen, Louise; Jansen van Vuuren, Joey; Jansen van Vuuren, Anna-Marie",Human-Centric Computing in a Data-Driven Society,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979057/,427

However, a fundamental algorithmic question underlying such mechanisms is hardly understood: how to verify whether a given network reroutes flows along feasible paths, without violating capacity constraints, for up to k link failures? We chart the algorithmic complexity landscape of resilient routing under link failures, considering shortest path routing based on link weights as e.g. deployed in the ECMP protocol. We study two models: a pessimistic model where flows interfere in a worst-case manner along equal-cost shortest paths, and an optimistic model where flows are routed in a best-case manner, and we present a complete picture of the algorithmic complexities. We further propose a strategic search algorithm that checks only the critical failure scenarios while still providing correctness guarantees. Our experimental evaluation on a benchmark of Internet and datacenter topologies confirms an improved performance of our strategic search by several orders of magnitude.","Schmid, Stefan; Schnepf, Nicolas; Srba, Jiří",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979162/,427

49247,The European Union and North-East Asia: Recent Historical Context,2021-01-10,"Software developers frequently check their code changes by running a set of tests against their code. Tests that can nondeterministically pass or fail when run on the same code version are called flaky tests. These tests are a major problem because they can mislead developers to debug their recent code changes when the failures are unrelated to these changes. One prominent category of flaky tests is order-dependent (OD) tests, which can deterministically pass or fail depending on the order in which the set of tests are run. By detecting OD tests in advance, developers can fix these tests before they change their code. Due to the high cost required to explore all possible orders (n! permutations for n tests), prior work has developed tools that randomize orders to detect OD tests. Experiments have shown that randomization can detect many OD tests, and that most OD tests depend on just one other test to fail. However, there was no analysis of the probability that randomized orders detect OD tests. In this paper, we present the first such analysis and also present a simple change for sampling random test orders to increase the probability. We finally present a novel algorithm to systematically explore all consecutive pairs of tests, guaranteeing to detect all OD tests that depend on one other test, while running substantially fewer orders and tests than simply running all test pairs.","Wei, Anjiang; Yi, Pu; Xie, Tao; Marinov, Darko; Lam, Wing",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979169/,427

Depending upon the amount required by the plants for their growth, they can be broadly divided into macro- and microelement. Plants generally absorb these elements through the root system from the soil. Humans have been dependent on plants since the advent of civilization for food and medicine. With the increase in population there has been an increase in demand for the food and which resulted in the intensification of agriculture. Needless to mention, this often results in scarcity of available nutrients from the soil, thereby stressing the necessity adding excess nutrients from outside. Thus the relevance of fertilization comes into the picture and its importance has been gradually felt by the scientists since the last 200 years. Various types of fertilizers containing essential elements are now being added to agricultural lands for betterment of yield. This chapter is an attempt to highlight the various aspects of three essential macroelements required by the plants, namely nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K).

They are a convenient operational model to treat robustness against uncertainties. A typical objective is to find the parameter values that maximize the reachability of some target states. In this paper, we consider automatically proving robustness, that is, an [Formula: see text] -close upper bound on the maximal reachability probability. The result of our procedure actually provides an almost-optimal parameter valuation along with this upper bound. We propose to tackle these ETR-hard problems by a tight combination of two significantly different techniques: monotonicity checking and parameter lifting. The former builds a partial order on states to check whether a pMC is (local or global) monotonic in a certain parameter, whereas parameter lifting is an abstraction technique based on the iterative evaluation of pMCs without parameter dependencies. We explain our novel algorithmic approach and experimentally show that we significantly improve the time to determine almost-optimal synthesis.","Spel, Jip; Junges, Sebastian; Katoen, Joost-Pieter",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979194/,427

Our method starts with applying the DeepPoly abstract domain to analyze the network. If the robustness property cannot be verified, the result is inconclusive. Due to the over-approximation, the computed region in the abstraction may be spurious in the sense that it does not contain any true counterexample. Our goal is to identify such spurious regions and use them to guide the abstraction refinement. The core idea is to make use of the obtained constraints of the abstraction to infer new bounds for the neurons. This is achieved by linear programming techniques. With the new bounds, we iteratively apply DeepPoly, aiming to eliminate spurious regions. We have implemented our approach in a prototypical tool DeepSRGR. Experimental results show that a large amount of regions can be identified as spurious, and as a result, the precision of DeepPoly can be significantly improved. As a side contribution, we show that our approach can be applied to verify quantitative robustness properties.","Yang, Pengfei; Li, Renjue; Li, Jianlin; Huang, Cheng-Chao; Wang, Jingyi; Sun, Jun; Xue, Bai; Zhang, Lijun",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979199/,427

The Court refuses to check the President because of institutional competence constraints, believing that the only issues that can be resolved by the judiciary are those that can be done on the basis of reasoned argument. When courts go beyond this role, they endanger their legitimacy as legal institutions because they act beyond their area of competence.

50217,Secure Communication,2020-09-12,"[Image: see text] Ultraviolet (UV) devices emitting UVC irradiation (200–280 nm) have proven to be effective for virus disinfection, especially on surfaces and in air, due to their rapid effectiveness and limited to no material corrosion. Numerous studies of UV-induced inactivation focused on nonenveloped viruses. Little is known about UVC action on enveloped viruses across UVC wavelengths. In this study, we determined inactivation efficiencies of two coronaviruses (ssRNA) and an enveloped dsRNA bacteriophage surrogate in buffered aqueous solution (pH 7.4) using five commonly available UVC devices that uniquely emit light at different wavelengths spanning 222 nm emitting krypton chloride (KrCl*) excimers to 282 nm emitting UVC LEDs. Our results show that enveloped viruses can be effectively inactivated using UVC devices, among which the KrCl* excimer had the best disinfection performance (i.e., highest inactivation rate) for all three enveloped viruses. The coronaviruses exhibited similar sensitivities to UV irradiation across the UVC range, whereas the bacteriophage surrogate was much more resistant and exhibited significantly higher sensitivity to the Far UVC (<230 nm) irradiation. This study provides necessary information and guidance for using UVC devices for enveloped virus disinfection, which may help control virus transmission in public spaces during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Ma, Ben; Linden, Yarrow S.; Gundy, Patricia M.; Gerba, Charles P.; Sobsey, Mark D.; Linden, Karl G.",Environ Sci Technol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7986976/,427

In this study, the seasonal polysaccharide yield and respective quality were evaluated in three selected seaweeds, namely the agarophyte Gracilaria gracilis, the carrageenophyte Calliblepharis jubata (both red seaweeds) and the alginophyte Sargassum muticum (brown seaweed). It was found that the agar synthesis of G. gracilis did not significantly differ with the seasons (27.04% seaweed dry weight (DW)). In contrast, the carrageenan content in C. jubata varied seasonally, being synthesized in higher concentrations during the summer (18.73% DW). Meanwhile, the alginate synthesis of S. muticum exhibited a higher concentration (36.88% DW) during the winter. Therefore, there is a need to assess the threshold at which seaweed-derived polymers may have positive effects or negative impacts on human nutrition. Furthermore, this study highlights the three polymers, along with their known thresholds, at which they can have positive and/or negative health impacts. Such knowledge is key to recognizing the paradigm governing their successful deployment and related beneficial applications in humans.","Cotas, João; Pacheco, Diana; Araujo, Glacio Souza; Valado, Ana; Critchley, Alan T.; Pereira, Leonel",Mar Drugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8003528/,427

Recently, nonthermal plasma-based technology has been applied to bioscience, medicine, agriculture, food processing, and safety. Various plasma device configurations and electrode layouts has fast-tracked plasma applications in the treatment of biological and material surfaces. The NBP action mechanism may be related to the synergy of plasma constituents, such as ultraviolet radiation or a reactive species. Recently, plasma has been used in the inactivation of viruses and resistant microbes, such as fungal cells, bacteria, spores, and biofilms made by microbes. It has also been used to heal wounds, coagulate blood, degrade pollutants, functionalize material surfaces, kill cancers, and for dental applications. This review provides an outline of NBP devices and their applications in bioscience and medicine. We also discuss the role of plasma-activated liquids in biological applications, such as cancer treatments and agriculture. The individual adaptation of plasma to meet specific medical requirements necessitates real-time monitoring of both the plasma performance and the target that is treated and will provide a new paradigm of plasma-based therapeutic clinical systems.","Choi, Eun H.; Uhm, Han S.; Kaushik, Nagendra K.",AAPPS Bull.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8024039/,427

Despite its importance, it is often considered too complex and confusing. Although most people dealing with arterial blood gases (ABGs) do not usually have problems with acid-base disorder assessment, such an analysis is also carried out by other healthcare workers for whom this can be a challenging task. Many aspects may be problematic, partly due to multiple data analysis methods and no definitive statement on which one is better. According to our survey, the correctness of arterial blood gas analysis is unsatisfactory, especially in mixed disorders, which do not always manifest an obvious set of symptoms. Therefore, ABG parameters can be used as an established biomarker panel, which is considered to be a powerful tool for personalized medicine. Moreover, using different approaches to analyze acid-base disorders can lead to varying diagnoses in some cases. Because of these problems, we developed a mobile application that can spot diagnostic differences by taking into account physiological and chemical approaches, including their variants, with a corrected anion gap. The proposed application is characterized by a high percentage of correct analyses and can be an essential aid for diagnosing acid-base disturbances.","Gutowski, Łukasz; Gutowska, Kaja; Brożek, Alicja; Nowicki, Marcin; Formanowicz, Dorota",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8038584/,427

Using the bivariate VARX model, our forecasting exercise shows that the Islamic banks’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic is not uniform across jurisdictions. While the Islamic banks’ dynamics in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Kuwait are less likely to be impaired, Bahrain, Brunei, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Turkey are expected to be relatively more affected especially in terms of their size growth. Saudi Arabia will continue leading the growth momentum of the global Islamic banking sector, and its Islamic banks’ assets are expected to reach at least $185.4 billion by the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.

Simple, cost effective measures such as mask wearing and hand hygiene have been shown to reduce the spread of droplet borne viruses. Compliance with these measures is variable and when performed improperly, reduce efficacy. OBJECTIVE: In this paper we aim to determine whether the provision of masks at hospital entrances and the use of volunteers to ensure correct mask wearing and hand hygiene can improve compliance with infection prevention measures for COVID-19. METHOD: Visitor and staff compliance with mask wearing and hand hygiene measures were observed with and without the presence of masks and volunteers at hospital entrances at a District General Hospital. RESULTS: A total of 519 people were observed entering the hospital. Mask wearing went from 71% to 99% (P = <0.001) with the addition of volunteers. Provision of masks increased mask wearing from 56% to 97% (P = <0.001). Hand hygiene was improved from 9% to 84% (P = <0.001) with the presence of volunteers. DISCUSSION: A statistically significant improvement in hand hygiene and correct mask wearing was seen with both the presence of volunteers at hospital entrances and with the provision of masks. This is a relatively small study with heterogenous cohorts of staff and visitors. However, these results appear to indicate that use of volunteers and provision of masks at entrances may improve the compliance with the measures that been shown to reduce the in-hospital transmission of COVID-19.","Stanier, Paul B; Lochab, Savneet K; Grice, John E; Stanier, Paul B; Lochab, Savneet K",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030220/,427

Research Design and Methods: The study population comprised 133 patients with COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) at an academic, urban, quaternary-care center between March 10(th) and April 8(th), 2020. Patients were categorized based on the presence of DM and early-onset hyperglycemia (EHG), defined as a blood glucose >180 mg/dL during the first two days of ICU admission. The primary outcome was 14-day in-hospital mortality; also examined were 60-day in-hospital mortality and the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6, procalcitonin, and lactate. Results: Compared to non-DM patients without EHG, non-DM patients with EHG exhibited higher adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for in-hospital mortality at 14 days (HR 5.76, p=0.008) and 60 days (HR 7.28, p=0.004). Non-DM patients with EHG also featured higher levels of mean CRP (322.3±177.7 mg/L, p=0.036), procalcitonin (34.75±69.33 ng/mL, p=0.028), and lactate (2.7±2.1 mmol/L, p=0.023). Conclusions: In patients with critical illness from COVID-19, those without DM with EHG were at greatest risk of 14-day and 60-day in-hospital mortality. The limitations of our study include its retrospective design, and relatively small cohort. However, our results raise the possibility that the combination of elevated glucose and lactate may identify a specific cohort of individuals at high mortality risk from COVID-19, and suggest that glucose testing and control are important in individuals with COVID-19, even in those without pre-existing diabetes.","Bass*, Ilana R; Mazori*, Alon; Chan, Lili; Mathews, Kusum; Altman, Deena; Saha, Aparna; Soh, Howard; Wen, Huei Hsun; Bose, Sonali; Leven, Emily; Wang, Jing Gennie; Mosoyan, Gohar; Pattharanitima, Pattharawin; Greco, Giampolo; Gallagher, Emily Jane",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090102/,427

RECENT FINDINGS: The timing of presentation and features of diagnosis are described. Cardiac involvement is common and is the focus of this review. Arrhythmias, heart block, acute heart failure, shock, cardiac dysfunction, and coronary dilation have all been reported. Therapies used to treat children with this hyperinflammation syndrome include supportive care and agents that modulate the immune system. Therapies commonly described include intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, and cytokine-directed agents, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockade and interleukin receptor blockade. The threshold for diagnosing coronary involvement in MIS-C is coronary artery dimensions indexed to body surface that exceed the normative values (Z score >2). Those hospitalized with MIS-C are evaluated by electrocardiogram and echocardiogram; outpatient assessment by a cardiologist is indicated prior to sports clearance. SUMMARY: The prognosis of treated MIS-C patients is good. Future work is needed to understand the scope of cardiac involvement associated with acute COVID-19 and MIS-C in children and to define the optimal therapeutic targets for these distinct entities.","Jone, Pei-Ni; Everitt, Melanie D.",Curr Treat Options Peds,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8100365/,427

BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a class I treatment for cardiovascular disease, still, underutilization of these services remains. During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, an even greater gap in CR care has been present. PURPOSE AND METHODS: We aimed to present the cardiac rehabilitation during COVID 19 times in Belgrade. At the beginning of epidemic in Serbia the number of patients in in-house city program was 70 out of 70 beds, with 200 patients who were scheduled (on the waiting list). Similarly to the other countries, we continued to admit only urgent patients with acute coronary settings. RESULTS: Only one PPCI center in Belgrade (2 million inhabitants plus surrounding area; out of five centers) continue to admit COVID-negative patients with STEMI from 13of March to 11 of May, during the first pick of COVID-19 epidemic in Serbia. Out -patients cardiac rehabilitation programs were stopped. The totals of 80 patients (PCR negative) were transferred to exercised based cardiac rehabilitation secondary prevention program during the first pick of epidemic directly from acute hospital. The majority of patients were males in their 50s. All risk factors were noted and patients were with much less risk factors compared to non- epidemic era. Lipid profile was measured. Six minutes walking test was performed at the beginning and exercise plan was made. Unfortunately, exercise based three weeks in- house cardiac rehabilitation was completed in only 1% of patients while others quite the program.

This is likely due to a combination of immune dysfunction, immunosuppressive therapy and excess co-morbidities. The aim of this study is to describe clinical characteristics of patients with lupus nephritis (LN) and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to identify baseline variables associated with a severe infection requiring hospitalization. METHOD: A telephone survey investigating the impact of COVID-19 on patients with biopsy - proven LN was administered. Data extraction included diagnosis, disease activity status, demographics, occupational exposure, adherence to social distancing advise, therapy, comorbidities, and laboratory tests. Covid-19 was classified as definite diagnosis of Covid-19 disease (presence of symptomatic Covid-19 infection, confirmed by a nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test). Comparisons between patients with or without hospitalization were performed. RESULTS: 114 patients (median age 34,9 ± 12,4 years) with LN were included in the study. All were on different doses glucocorticoids, 82 were taking hydroxychloroquine and 30 took immunosuppressants. 31 patients (26 women, 5 men) developed symptomatic COVID-19 infection - they have at least one symptom (chest pain, fever, asthenia, chills, cough, sore throat, dyspnea, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, odynophagia, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, hypo-, ageusia, hypo-, anosmia) of COVID-19 and were PCR test positive. These 31 patients prior to their COVID-19 illness were treated with methylprednisolone, 16 - with cyclophosphamide, 8 - with azathioprine, 3 – with hydroxychloroquine. Six patients (4 men, 2 women) required hospitalization - these were more frequently older and with comorbidities (cardio-respiratory illness, hypertension and other) and active LN (3 –class IV LN, 2-class V LN, 1 class III LN and 1 Class II LN, according the 2003 ISN/RPS classification). Adherence to therapy and to social distancing advise was high. The median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 6 (3-11) days. The median length of stay was 12 days (8-20) days. No deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 is more frequent in the subgroup of LN patients without therapy with hydroxychloroquine, which might play some protective role against the most harmful manifestations of Covid-19. Male sex, previous lung disease, serum creatinine level, proteinuria, glucocorticoids use > 5 mg/day, were associated to hospitalization of patients with LN.","Valentinova Monova, Daniela; Monov, Simeon",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8195109/,427

The present study suggests that plasma IL-6, reflecting the inflammatory state of the patient, is predictive for postoperative overall survival (OS). ABSTRACT: Background: Plasma IL-6 and YKL-40 are prognostic biomarkers for OS in patients with different types of solid tumors, but they have not been studied in patients before surgery of metastatic bone disease (MBD) of the extremities. The aim was to evaluate the prognostic value of plasma IL-6 and YKL-40 in patients undergoing surgery for MBD of the extremities. Patients and Methods: A prospective study included all patients undergoing surgery for MBD in the extremities at a tertiary referral center during the period 2014–2018. Preoperative blood samples from index surgery were included. IL-6 and YKL-40 concentrations in plasma were determined by commercial ELISA. A total of 232 patients (median age 66 years, IQR 58–74; female 51%) were included. Results: Cox regression analysis was performed to identify independent prognostic factors for OS. IL-6 correlated with YKL-40 (rho = 0.46, p < 0.01). In univariate analysis (log(2) continuous variable) IL-6 (HR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.16–1.37), CRP (HR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.12–1.29) and YKL-40 (HR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.15–1.37) were associated with short OS. In multivariable analysis, adjusted for known risk factors for survival, only log(2)(IL-6) was independently associated with OS (HR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.08–1.43), whereas CRP and YKL-40 were not. Conclusion: High preoperative plasma IL-6 is an independent biomarker of short OS in patients undergoing surgery for MBD.","Sørensen, Michala Skovlund; Colding-Rasmussen, Thomas; Horstmann, Peter Frederik; Hindsø, Klaus; Dehlendorff, Christian; Johansen, Julia Sidenius; Petersen, Michael Mørk",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8201042/,427

Intriguingly, miR-181a is implicated in defective antiviral and vaccine responses in older individuals, as its expression declines in naïve T cells with increasing age. Here, we review the pathways that are regulated by miR-181a and that explain the unique role of miR-181a in T cell development, T cell activation and antiviral T cell responses. These studies provide a framework for understanding how a decline in miR-181a expression in T cells could contribute to age-related defects in adaptive immunity. We furthermore review the mechanisms that cause the age-related decline in miR-181a expression and discuss the potential of restoring miR-181a expression or targeting miR-181a-regulated pathways to improve impaired T cell responses in older individuals.","Kim, Chulwoo; Ye, Zhongde; Weyand, Cornelia M.; Goronzy, Jörg J.",Immun Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8203492/,427

Using critical discourse analysis, this paper analyses and evaluates policy rhetoric to explore how the NEET ‘problem’, agenda and population are constituted by the UK and Scottish governments. In doing so, numerous unifying and problematic NEET policy tropes are identified, challenging the popular notion of significant policy divergence between the punitive reputation of Westminster and the image of Scottish governance as more socially democratic. Moreover, this paper differs from traditional policy analysis by also evaluating policy from the perspective of young people, drawing on empirical data from a qualitative study of the school-to-work transitions of NEET and marginally employed young people in Scotland.","McPherson, Charlotte",JAYS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8220365/,427
54953,Waiting for Recovery: The Canadian Labour Market in June 2020,2020-08-01,"[Image: see text] Owing to their potential applicability against multidrug-resistant bacteria, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) or host defense peptides (HDPs) gain increased attention. Besides diverse immunomodulatory roles, their classical mechanism of action mostly involves membrane disruption of microbes. Notably, their unbalanced overexpression has also been associated with host cell cytotoxicity in various diseases. Relatedly, AMPs can be subject to aggregate formation, either via self-assembly or together with other compounds, which has demonstrated a modulation effect on their biological functions, thus highly relevant both for drug targeting projects and understanding their in vivo actions. However, the molecular aspects of the related assembly formation are not understood. Here, we focused in detail on an experimentally studied AMP–drug system, i.e., CM15–suramin, and performed all-atom and coarse-grain (CG) simulations. Results obtained for all systems were in close line with experimental observations and indicate that the CM15–suramin aggregation is an energetically favorable and dynamic process. In the presence of bilayers, the peptide–drug assembly formation was highly dependent on lipid composition, and peptide aggregates themselves were also capable of binding to the membranes. Interestingly, longer CG simulations with zwitterionic membranes indicated an intermediate state in the presence of both AMP–drug assemblies and monomeric peptides located on the membrane surface. In sharp contrast, larger AMP–drug aggregates could not be detected with a negatively charged membrane, rather the AMPs penetrated its surface in a monomeric form, in line with previous in vitro observations. Considering experimental and theoretical results, it is promoted that in biological systems, cationic AMPs may often form associates with anionic compounds in a reversible manner, resulting in lower bioactivity. This is only mildly affected by zwitterionic membranes; however, membranes with a negative charge strongly alter the energetic preference of AMP assemblies, resulting in the dissolution of the complexes into the membrane. The phenomenon observed here at a molecular level can be followed in several experimental systems studied recently, where peptides interact with food colors, drug molecules, or endogenous compounds, which strongly indicates that reversible associate formation is a general phenomenon for these complexes. These results are hoped to be exploited in novel therapeutic strategies aiming to use peptides as drug targets and control AMP bioactivity by directed assembly formation.","Kohut, Gergely; Juhász, Tünde; Quemé-Peña, Mayra; Bősze, Szilvia Erika; Beke-Somfai, Tamás",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8223213/,427

Since then, there has been a reorganization of health services, changing the normal approach for the different cases of public health. Excess deaths recorded without a COVID-19 diagnosis are called excess mortality without COVID-19 (EM non-COVID-19). This study aims to estimate the EM non-COVID in the 7-month period after the first registered Covid-19 death. METHODS: The following 2 methods were used to estimate the excess mortality in this period: the daily historical average of reported deaths and an adapted auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, considering the previous 5 years of records until October 16. For this model, after March 16, data was replaced with the daily historical average deaths from the previous 5 years, simulating the closest scenario possible as there was no pandemic. Only deaths from natural causes were selected for these estimations. For EM non-COVID-19 estimation, we subtracted the COVID-19 deaths from the overall excess mortality. RESULTS: Between March 16, 2020, and October 16, 2020, there was an excess of 6,330 deaths from natural causes, i.e., nearly 12% more than expected. Both methods estimated an EM non-COVID-19 of around 66–67% in this period, with a greater relevance in mid-July and mid-September. CONCLUSIONS: Excess mortality was present almost every day during the study period. EM non-COVID-19 seemed to vary over time, showing some inadequacy of healthcare services in management of other patients free of COVID-19 in Portugal during periods with a greater patient volume. It is necessary to take care and monitor COVID-19 cases but also non-COVID-19 cases.","Vieira, André; Ricoca Peixoto, Vasco; Aguiar, Pedro; Sousa, Paulo; Abrantes, Alexandre",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8247835/,427
55576,Post-normal: Crisis and the End of the Ordinary,2020-11-11,"Just after a decade of its existence, the BRICS group and the rising powers narrative have lost some of their appeal. The economic growth story has stalled, and domestic political challenges curb the group’s foreign policy potency. In the context of the presumed decline of relevance, the article asks what foreign policy value is BRICS providing for its members? An inner-group perspective is applied. The article argues that BRICS is offering a number of benefits. Namely: indirectly supporting domestic regime stability, protection from unwanted external interferences, flexible alignment in foreign policies and boosting of regional authority. The article goes through the rhetorical codification of BRICS summit documents, traces the uncodified principles of cooperation among its members and illustrates its argument with selected empirical examples. Far from being in decline, BRICS delivers important value added for the group which often goes missing in the literature on regional powers.","Brosig, Malte",Int Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8253684/,427

In this article, we examine ‘foundational legitimacy,’ or a hegemonic narrative about the way in which a new state was created, and the role particular groups played in its creation. We argue that the way in which victory is institutionalized can pose a grave threat to the democratic project. If reconciliation and democratization depend of integrating losers into the new order and recognizing plural narratives of state formation, then exclusivist narratives based on foundational legitimacy pose a direct challenge to both. We focus on two Yugoslav successor states, Kosovo and Croatia. For both cases, we trace how appeals to ‘foundational legitimacy’ by groups that claim a leading role in the struggle for independence fostered a politics of exclusion, which ran counter to both the spirit of democracy. In Croatia, foundational legitimacy was partly challenged after 2000 by reformist political forces, though more recently it has re-appeared in political life. In Kosovo, foundational legitimacy was never successfully challenged and continues to shape political dynamics to the present day.","Boduszyński, Mieczysław P.; Pavlaković, Vjeran",J Contemp Hist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8280552/,427

This study was designed to focus light on non-cutaneous lesions (prevalence, intensity, and impacts) among necropsied LSD infected cattle. We selected some dairy and beef flocks (Frisian breed) located in 3 governorates (Sharkia, Dakahlia, and Kaloubia) in Nile delta, Egypt, in the period from January 2019 to January 2020 for our survey study. The case history of farms declared no previous vaccination of examined farms. The clinical signs, morbidity, and mortality rates were recorded. Average morbidity and mortality percentage were 22.28% and 6.59%, respectively. PCR for specimens from liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, testis, udder, trachea, and lymph node indicates presence of amplicon capripoxvirus gene product at molecular weight size 192 bp. Postmortem lesions of necropsied and emergency slaughtered were recorded. The main detectable histopathology lesions among the infected animals were orchitis (75%), mastitis in immature and lactating udder (66.66%), and necrotic hepatitis (77.77%), disseminated vasculitis (61.11), glomerulonephritis (55.55), myocardial degeneration (50%), and serous atrophy of coronary fats (38.88%), lymphadenitis (88.88%), necrosis and depleted lymphoid tissue of spleen (38.88%), necrotic myositis (77.77%), tracheitis (16.66%), and pneumonia (interstitial bronchopneumonia) (44.44%) besides intra-cytoplasmic inclusions bodies in skin (33.33%). It could be concluded that higher mortalities of LSD may be due to systemic infection of infected animals which had great impact on economic losses among breeding flocks.","Ali, Abdelmoneim A.; Neamat-Allah, Ahmed N.

56366,"Dynamic spillovers between the term structure of interest rates, bitcoin, and safe-haven currencies",2021-08-02,"China and Vietnam have experienced waves of labour and welfare reform since both countries shifted to market socialism, pursuing a development model that depends on the labour of millions of rural–urban migrants in global factories. Their similar development trajectories are productive for theorizing the relationship between labour and welfare. This article conceptualises the two countries’ distinctive regime of migrant labour welfare as integral to a cycle of commodification that encompasses the overlapping processes of commodification, de-commodification and re-commodification of labour. After decades of collectivized labour under state socialism, the cycle begins with the commodification of labour through market reforms that led to mass rural–urban migration and the rise of the global factory alongside the dismantling of the former socialist welfare system. It was then followed by de-commodification attempts aimed at providing forms of social protection that offset the labour precarity caused by decades of labour market liberalisation. Despite the emergence of new universal welfare programs, the market has increasingly intruded into social protection, especially through financialized products targeted at the labouring masses who must compensate for the failings of public welfare programs. As such, these welfare regimes are undergoing a process of re-commodification in which the protection of labour is re-embedded into the market as a commodity to be consumed by the migrant workers with their meagre wages. The “cycle of commodification” offers an analytical framework to understand welfare regimes as a social and political field that keeps evolving in response to the changing global valuation of labour.","Lin, Jake; Nguyen, Minh T.

56632,Exploring usage of mobile banking apps in the UAE: a categorical regression analysis,2021-08-09,"Monitoring the immune system’s status has emerged as an urgent demand in critical health conditions. The circulating cytokine levels in the blood reflect a thorough insight into the immune system status. Indeed, measuring one cytokine may deliver more information equivalent to detecting multiple diseases at a time. However, if the reported cytokine levels are interpreted with considering lifestyle and any comorbid health conditions for the individual, this will promote a more precise assessment of the immune status. Therefore, this study addresses the most recent advanced assays that deliver rapid, accurate measuring of the cytokine levels in human blood, focusing on add-on potentials for point-of-care (PoC) or personal at-home usage, and investigates existing health questionnaires as supportive assessment tools that collect all necessary information for the concrete analysis of the measured cytokine levels. We introduced a ten-dimensional featuring of cytokine measurement assays. We found 15 rapid cytokine assays with assay time less than 1 h; some could operate on unprocessed blood samples, while others are mature commercial products available in the market. In addition, we retrieved several health questionnaires that addressed various health conditions such as chronic diseases and psychological issues. Then, we present a machine learning-based solution to determine what makes the immune system fit. To this end, we discuss how to employ topic modeling for deriving the definition of immune fitness automatically from literature. Finally, we propose a prototype model to assess the fitness of the immune system through leveraging the derived definition of the immune fitness, the cytokine measurements delivered by a rapid PoC immunoassay, and the complementary information collected by the health questionnaire about other health factors. In conclusion, we discovered various advanced rapid cytokine detection technologies that are promising candidates for point-of-care or at-home usage; if paired with a health status questionnaire, the assessment of the immune system status becomes solid and we demonstrated potentials for promoting the assessment tool with data mining techniques.","Jamaludeen, Noor; Beyer, Christian; Billing, Ulrike; Vogel, Katrin; Brunner-Weinzierl, Monika; Spiliopoulou, Myra",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8348245/,427

57293,Macroeconomic determinants of remittances to India,2021-09-01,"STUDY QUESTION: How have the coronavirus 2019 (COVID–19)-driven changes in semen collection protocols, from on-site to at-home collection, impacted intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycle outcomes? SUMMARY ANSWER: Our data suggest that at-home semen collection within 2 hours of processing does not negatively impact semen parameters and IUI pregnancy outcomes. What is known already: There are mixed reports regarding the effect of at-home semen collection on IUI outcomes. In a study of 633 cycles, no differences in semen parameters or pregnancy rates were observed between home and clinic collections(1). Conversely, in a smaller cohort, at-home collection was associated with worse pregnancy outcomes when IUI was coupled with gonadotropin stimulation, but not when coupled with clomiphene(2). We previously reported no differences in semen parameters and in-vitro fertilization (IVF) embryo transfer outcomes, when cycles using semen collected at-home were compared to cycles with on-site collection(3). However, such findings cannot necessarily be extended to the IUI setting. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This is a retrospective cohort study of all 529 IUI cycles that took place in 2020 at an academic fertility center. Semen collected at the “clinic” was used for 143 cycles before the COVID–19 pandemic, and “at-home” collected specimens were used for the 386 cycles following the revised semen collection protocol. Participants/materials, setting, methods: Prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, semen was collected at our “clinic” and processed within ∼30 minutes. Post-COVID, in order to maintain social distancing, semen was collected “at-home”, at an IUI-approved cup, and transported to our center within 2 hours, while maintained to room temperature. Logistic regression models were performed to evaluate the effect of “at-home” collection on achieving pregnancy (positive pregnancy test-PPT) and clinical pregnancy (sonographic confirmation-CP), adjusting for age and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The mean age (SD) (years) of the female partner was 35.4 (4.2) vs. 35.4 (4.4) (p = 0.978) and of the male partner 36.6 (4.4) vs. 37.1 (p = 0.328) for the “clinic” vs. “at-home” groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in day–3 follicle stimulating hormone and AMH. In both groups the most common diagnoses were idiopathic and combined factors infertility (27.3% and 18.9% & 24.1% and 25.1%, respectively for the “clinic” & “at-home” groups, p = 0.376). Similarly, there were no differences regarding ovarian stimulation, and gonadotropins were the most common medication used in both groups (“clinic”: 44.1% vs. “at-home”: 39.4%, p = 0.775). Semen analysis parameters (volume, motility, forward progression, total motile count) were comparable between the 2 groups, with the exception of concentration (mil/ml) which was higher with “at-home” collection [66.1 (45.0) vs. 81.1 (63.0), p = 0.009]. In unadjusted models, “at-home” collection had no significant effect on the odds for a PPT [OR (95%CI): 0.691 (0.427–1.119), p = 0.133] or CP [0.751 (0.447–1.263), p = 0.281]. These results persisted even when adjusting for maternal age and AMH: PPT [0.708 (0.435–1.153), p = 0.165] and CP [0.773 (0.455–1.312), p = 0.340]. When sub-analysis was performed within the different medication groups, the above findings persisted for both gonadotropin and oral medication cycles. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The limitations of the study include its retrospective design and the absence of livebirth data, given the limited follow up period. However, regarding the latter, one can use the ongoing clinical pregnancy rate as an accurate estimate of livebirth. Wider implications of the findings: At-home semen collection within 2 hours of processing did not negatively impact semen analysis parameters or pregnancy outcomes following IUI. These data constitute an important addition to the current limited literature on the subject and provides an additional level of safety for our patients and staff during the COVID–19 crisis.

This situation accentuated the inequality in accessing quality education and generated high rates of stress, anxiety, and general discomfort in teachers. This study aimed to explore the mental health of teachers who were forced to telework because of COVID-19, and to analyze the association with sociodemographic, teacher-related, and working conditions. The sample was 278 classroom teachers in Chile who teleworked more than 50% during the 2020 academic year. The participants were mostly women (82%) who entered the teaching profession at age 30 or younger (87%) and worked two or more unpaid overtime hours per day (67%). The dependent variable was mental health measured through the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). The independent variables were sociodemographic, teacher-related, and work conditions. The internal structure of the mental health construct was evaluated using the Rasch model. Crude odds ratios (cORs) and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were estimated using logistic regression models. A high rate of poor mental health was identified in teachers (58%). The variables associated with poor mental health were working in a private–subsidized school (aOR = 2.89; 95% CI: 1.16–7.22), working two or more unpaid overtime hours (aOR = 2.25; 95% CI: 1.11–4.59), and being absent due to sickness (aOR = 3.82; 95% CI: 1.53–9.58). These results provide evidence suggesting the need for actions to improve the working conditions of teachers who telework in order to improve their mental health, and thus have a positive impact on the entire educational community.","Palma-Vasquez, Claudia; Carrasco, Diego; Hernando-Rodriguez, Julio C.",Eur J Investig Health Psychol Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8314372/,427

Following the risk-based approach, we described the proportion of eligible people receiving antihypertensive medication in Peru. METHODS: Analysis of six (2015-2020) national health surveys. Absolute cardiovascular risk was computed with the 2019 WHO cardiovascular risk charts and based on local guidelines. Antihypertensive treatment allocation based on the absolute cardiovascular risk was defined using the Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settings and the HEARTS guidelines by the WHO; we also followed the recommendations by local guidelines. RESULTS: There were 120,059 people. Overall, according to the local guidelines the 17.9% of the population would be eligible for antihypertensive medication while this estimate was 8.1% based on the WHO guidelines. At the national level, depending on the guidelines, we observed a steady trend of eligible people receiving antihypertension medication (e.g., men, local guidelines), a decreasing trend (e.g., men, <60, local guidelines) or an increasing trend (e.g., men, ≥60, local guidelines). At the sub-national level, seventeen regions showed an increasing antihypertensive treatment rate based on the local guidelines; when based on the WHO guidelines, eleven regions showed a decreasing rate. CONCLUSIONS: Peru needs to define a tool for surveillance of absolute cardiovascular risk and to monitor antihypertensive treatment allocation among high-risk people.

Mariotti (2021) also points out that a real transdisciplinary integration (i.e., à la Prigogine) implies a mutual nurturing, where one discipline´s conceptual apparatus is incorporated into the other. A fine-grained view of the epistemological differences of the two disciplines reveals that an integration might be more likely along some, but not all directions. I explain these differences based on different connotations of the concept of design. Particularly, when referring to design aspects of social systems, I also argue that systems approaches may serve as a bridge to integrate economics and engineering. Finally, I offer alternatives to explore how this integration might be undertaken.","García-Díaz, César",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8475842/,427

Pollution greatly reduced with an enhancement of air quality in this year. Lightning data for the analysis is derived from the ground based lightning Network -Earth Networks Global Lightning Network (ENGLN). Among the mega cities, Kolkata faces most lightning whereas Mumbai receives the least. CG lightning flash counts significantly decrease in 2020 for Kolkata, Bengaluru, New Delhi and increase for Chennai, Hyderabad and Mumbai though the increase for the last two cities are very insignificant. This increase may be due to greater impact of meteorological factors on lightning than the pollutant concentrations. The lightning activity averaged over all the mega cities follows the trend of pollutant concentrations and average CG lightning flash counts go to minimum in the COVID-19 lockdown year 2020. Analysis also reveals that average seasonal CG lightning flash counts, average positive CG lightning flash counts and maximum peak CG currents show positive correlations with the concentration of all the four pollutants.

We aim to determine the prevalence and characteristics of headache in COVID-19-infected individuals and make a comparison with those without headaches. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional observational study was conducted from 1 October to 31 October 2020. Data were collected using a detailed questionnaire. We compared the data of those with and without headaches to identify the differences between the groups. RESULTS: During the study period of 1 month, among 225 COVID-19-infected patients, 33.8% patients had headaches. The mean age of patients with headache was 48.89 ± 15.19 years. In all, 53.9% were females. In 65.8%, headache occurred at the onset of viral illness; 44.7% described the headache as dull aching; 39.5% had bifrontal headache; and 32.9% had holocranial headache. In total, 78.9% had complete resolution of headache within 5 days. A comparison between those with and without headaches showed that those with headaches were more younger (48.89 ± 15.19 vs 54.61 ± 14.57 years, p = 0.007) and of female gender (41/76(53.9%) vs 41/149 (27.5%), p = 0.001). Primary headache disorders were more common in the headache group. Levels of inflammatory markers such as leukocyte count (7234.17 ± 3054.96 vs 8773.35 ± 5103.65, p = 0.017), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (39.28 ± 23.29 vs 50.41 ± 27.61, p = 0.02) and ferritin (381.06 ± 485.2 vs 657.10 ± 863.80, p = 0.014) were lower in those with headaches. CONCLUSIONS: Headaches are a common and early symptom of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection more frequently seen in young females and in those with a history of primary headache disorders. The lower level of inflammatory markers in those with headaches suggests that these headaches are probably due to the local spread of virus through the trigeminal nerve endings, resulting in activation of the trigeminovascular system.","Souza, Delon D; Shivde, Sonia; Awatare, Poonam; Avati, Amrutha; John, Saji K; Badachi, Sagar; Nadig, Raghunandan; Sarma, GRK; Mathew, Thomas",SAGE Open Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511910/,427

Synthetic siRNA duplexes can induce high levels of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons, in particular interferon-alpha, after systemic administration in mammals and in primary human blood cell cultures. These responses are greatly potentiated by the use of delivery vehicles that facilitate cellular uptake of the siRNA. Although the immunomodulatory effects of nucleic acids may be harnessed therapeutically, for example, in oncology and allergy applications, in many cases immune activation represents a significant undesirable side effect due to the toxicities associated with excessive cytokine release and associated inflammatory syndromes. The potential for siRNA-based drugs to be rendered immunogenic is also a cause for concern because the establishment of an antibody response may severely compromise both safety and efficacy. Clearly, there are significant implications both for the development of siRNA-based drugs and in the interpretation of gene-silencing effects elicited by siRNA.

The objective of our study was to determine the agreement in the diagnosis reached solely using hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained, full-thickness sections versus using a combination of HE and IHC. Enteric sections from 44 ferrets previously diagnosed with IBD or intestinal lymphoma and 3 control ferrets were analyzed by pathologists with expertise in ferrets. A pathologist blinded to the original diagnosis assessed the same HE-stained sections. Analysis was then repeated using HE sections in parallel with sections stained using antibodies against CD3 and CD79a. No significant difference was found between the original HE diagnosis and the HE diagnosis reached by the blinded pathologist (p = 0.91) or between the blinded pathologist's HE versus HE with IHC diagnosis (p = 0.16). In the 2 cases where disagreement was present, IHC was pivotal in reaching a final diagnosis. There was no significant age (p = 0.29) difference between diagnoses; however, significantly more male ferrets were affected with IBD than females (p = 0.004). Immunophenotype of the lymphoma was not correlated with predilection for location in the intestinal wall (p = 0.44). Results suggest that although IHC is not necessary to distinguish IBD from intestinal lymphoma in ferrets, it can be useful a definitive diagnosis in cases of severe IBD.","Watson, Megan K; Cazzini, Paola; Mayer, Joerg; Gottdenker, Nicole; Reavill, Drury; Parry, Nicola; Fox, James G; Sakamoto, Kaori","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638716641156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27026106/,427

66015,Offline: Thinking the pandemic.,2021-02-27,"PURPOSE Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is an independent predictor of mortality, and females typically achieve smaller improvements in CRF than males following exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR). High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to produce superior improvements in CRF than traditional CR, but the sex-differences are unknown. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate sex-differences for changes in CRF and cardiometabolic health indicators following HIIT in adults with coronary artery disease (CAD).Methods and ResultsA systemic search of 5 electronic databases for studies examining the effect of HIIT on measured CRF and cardiometabolic health indicators in adults with CAD was performed. Data (published and unpublished) from 14 studies were included in the meta-analyses with ~8-fold greater male than female participation (n=836 vs. n=103). Males with CAD achieved a near significant absolute improvement in CRF (mean difference [MD]: 1.07, 95% CI: -0.08 to 2.23 mL/kg/min, p=0.07) following HIIT when compared to control; there were insufficient data to conduct such an analysis in females. Significantly smaller improvements in CRF were experienced by females than males (MD: -1.10, 95% CI: -2.08 to -0.12 mL/kg/min; p=0.03); there was no sex-difference for the relative (percentage) change in CRF following HIIT. Females achieved significantly smaller reductions in body mass index (MD: -0.25, 95% CI: -0.03 to -0.47 kg/m2; p=0.02) and fasting blood glucose (MD: -0.38, 95% CI: -0.05 to -0.72; p=0.03); no sex-differences were observed for other cardiometabolic health indicators. CONCLUSION There are no sex-differences for relative improvements in CRF following HIIT; however, females are greatly underrepresented in trials. Future studies should increase female participation and perform sex-based analyses to determine sex-specific outcomes with HIIT.","Way, Kimberley L; Vidal-Almela, Sol; Moholdt, Trine; Currie, Katharine D; Aksetøy, Inger-Lise Aamot; Boidin, Maxime; Cornelissen, Veronique A; Joa, Kyung-Lim; Keech, Andrew; Jayo-Montoya, Jon Ander; Taylor, Jenna L; Fouriner, Karine; Reed, Jennifer L",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000002596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33449604/,427

Accordingly, we defined a transformation factor to convert level of tobacco smoke exposure and impact biomarkers from different biometrics. METHODS We examined smoking topography of recruited volunteers using a self-reporting survey. The level of tobacco smoke exposure and impact biomarkers in subjects' urine and blood were analysed. Results were used to assess the correlations between the topography survey items with biomarkers in biological matrices. The relationship between the biomarkers in urine and blood was analysed. Accordingly, we defined a transformation factor as the ratio of different biomarkers in urine and blood matrices. RESULTS Significant correlations among smoking topography variables and biomarkers were found. Besides, a strong significant association was found among urine and blood cotinine (ρ = 0.817) and NMR (ρ = 0.905). Urine vs blood cotinine and NMR transformation factors were calculated to be 6.17 L-Blood/g-Creatinine and 10.2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The validated transformation factor connects epidemiological cohort studies with tobacco smoking exposure risk assessment. Hence, this study might be beneficial for further habit-based smoking risk assessments to obtain successful regional cession policies.","Yang, Jiyeon; Hashemi, Shervin; Han, Wonseok; Lee, Chaelin; Kang, Younseok; Lim, Youngwook","Biomarkers : biochemical indicators of exposure, response, and susceptibility to chemicals",https://doi.org/10.1080/1354750x.2020.1797879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912026/,427

We conducted an observational epidemiological study of the outbreak, focusing on a total of 403 individuals who developed a fever of ≥ 37.5°C from 20 January to 22 February 2020. Quarantine measures are also discussed with a descriptive method. Of a total of 3,711 individuals (2,031 males) from 57 countries, 2,666 (71.8%) and 1,045 (28.2%) were passengers and crew with mean age of 66.0 (range: 2-98) and 36.6 (range: 19-64), respectively. Among 403 febrile individuals, 165 passengers and 58 crew members were diagnosed as laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases. Until 6 February, the number of confirmed cases was three or less per day. However, distribution of thermometers on 7 February revealed 43 confirmed cases, and it then started decreasing. The outbreak was initiated from decks for passengers and expanded to areas for crew. As of 17 March, when more than14 days had passed after disembarkation of all passengers and crew, there was no report of forming a cluster of infections in Japan from them. At the time of the initiation of quarantine, the outbreak had already expanded to most of the decks from those for passengers, and the results might suggest the contribution of the set of quarantine measures in unprecedented challenges of the control operation.","Tsuboi, Motoyuki; Hachiya, Masahiko; Noda, Shinichiro; Iso, Hiroyasu; Umeda, Tamami",Global health & medicine,https://doi.org/10.35772/ghm.2020.01037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330785/,427

AIM OF THE STUDY In the present study, meta-analysis has been performed in determining the efficacy and safety of DZHS combined with conventional treatment (CT) for ACI and GRADE assessment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing the use of DZHS for treating ACI were screened by searching the databases of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science as well as four Chinese databases. Meta-analysis was carried out with RevMan 5.3 and Stata 16.0 software. The quality of research evidence was assessed by the GRADEprofiler (GRADEpro version: 3.6). RESULTS Forty-three studies (n = 4618) were included. When compared to the control groups, the total effective rate of the national institutes of health stroke scale (NIHSS) was higher in the experimental group with DZHS (RR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.19 to 1.28, P < 0.001; RR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.21 to 1.38, P < 0.001); clinical symptoms and signs were improved in the experimental group with DZHS (RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.24, P < 0.001; RR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.42, P < 0.001); the incidence of adverse reactions was reduced in the experimental group with DZHS (RR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.26 to 0.98, P = 0.044); and the NIHSS score was decreased in the experimental group with DZHS (WMD = -3.30, 95% CI = -3.86 to -2.73, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS DZHS combined with CT is conditionally recommended to improve the total effective rate of the NIHSS, clinical symptoms, and neurological deficits and reduce the incidence of adverse reactions, and no serious adverse reactions were noted. The GRADE assessment indicates that the overall certainty quality of evidence is low. Further large-scale, well-designed and high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm the positive results.

68104,Global supply-chain effects of COVID-19 control measures.,2020-06-03,"In a previous study, the sequential optimization and regulation of environmental parameters using the PhotoBiobox was demonstrated with high throughput screening tests. In this study, we estimated changes in the biovolume-based composition of a polyculture built in vitro and composed of three algal strains: Chlorella sp., Scenedesmus sp., and Parachlorella sp. This study was performed using the PhotoBiobox under different temperatures (10-36°C) and light intensities (50-700 μmol m-2 s-1) in air and in 5% CO2. In 5% CO2, Chlorella sp. exhibited better adaptation to high temperatures than in air conditions. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the composition of Parachlorella sp. was highly related to temperature whereas Chlorella sp. and Scenedesmus sp. showed negative correlations in both air and 5% CO2. Furthermore, light intensity slightly affected the composition of Scenedesmus sp., whereas no significant effect was observed in other species. Based on these results, it is speculated that temperature is an important factor in influencing changes in algal polyculture community structure (PCS). These results further confirm that the PhotoBiobox is a convenient and available tool of performing lab-scale experiments on PCS changes. The application of the PhotoBiobox to the study of PCS will provide new insight into polyculture-based ecology.","Cho, Dae-Hyun; Cho, Kichul; Heo, Jina; Kim, Urim; Lee, Yong Jae; Choi, Dong-Yun; Yoo, Chan; Kim, Hee-Sik; Bae, Seunghee",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2006.06027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830191/,427

Generally, diagnosis is made in school-aged children but multiple cases have been diagnosed in adulthood. This study examines phenotypic differences between genetically confirmed cases and mutation-negative cases in adults. A comprehensive screening of 168 genes, including GS-related genes, was performed for 84 independent individuals who were referred to our institute with a clinical diagnosis of GS. The cases of pseudo Bartter syndrome (BS)/GS because of diuretic abuse or other causes, which was determined based on patients' medical records, were excluded during registration. Of these 70 eligible cases for analysis, 27 (38.6%) had genetic confirmation of GS, while 37 (52.8%) had no known variants associated with GS and were considered to be unsolved cases. Note that unsolved cases comprised older, mostly female, individuals with decreased kidney function and multiple basic features of GS. The phenotype of unsolved cases is similar to that of pseudo BS/GS cases, although these cases were excluded in advance. However, the genetic and autoimmune profiles of these unsolved cases have not yet been investigated to date. Therefore, these cases may be categorized into new disease groups.

72178,Nurses' role in curbing the pandemic affirms their wider remit in disease prevention and promoting vaccination.,2021-03-25,"INTRODUCTION Although antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance in the Netherlands is comparatively low, inappropriate prescription of antibiotics is substantial, mainly for respiratory tract infections (RTIs). General practitioners (GPs) experience pressure from patients with an immigration background to prescribe antibiotics and have difficulty communicating in a culturally sensitive way. Multifaceted interventions including communication skills training for GPs are shown to be most effective in reducing antibiotic prescription. The PARCA study aims to reduce the number of antibiotic prescriptions for RTIs through implementing a culturally sensitive communication intervention for GPs and evaluate it in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). METHODS AND ANALYSIS A non-blinded RCT including 58 GPs (29 for each arm). The intervention consists of: (1) An E-learning with 4 modules of 10-15 min each; (2) A face-to-face training session in (intercultural) communication skills including role plays with a training actor and (3) Availability of informative patient-facing materials that use simple words (A2/B1 level) in multiple languages. The primary outcome measure is the number of dispensed antibiotic courses qualifying for RTIs in primary care, per 1000 registered patients. The secondary outcome measure is the number of all dispensed antibiotic courses, per 1000 registered patients. The intervention arm will receive the training in Autumn 2021, followed by an observation period of 6 winter months for which numbers of antibiotics will be collected for both trial arms. The GPs/practices in the control arm can attend the training after the observation period. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Review Committee of Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam (MEC-2020-0142). The results of the trial will be published in international peer-reviewed scientific journals and will be disseminated through national and international congresses.

This study aimed to compare the characteristics and outcomes of patients who presented or were treated during off-hour versus on-hour in a multi-center registry. METHODS AC-LVO patients from 21 centres were categorised into the off-hour group and the on-hour group. Off-hour (weekends, holidays, and 18:00-7:59 on weekdays) and on-hour (8:00-17:59 on weekdays except for holidays) were defined according to arrival and groin-puncture time points, respectively. Subgroup comparisons between patients both arrived and treated during off-hour (true off-hour) and on-hour (true on-hour) were performed. The primary outcome was the 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Secondary outcomes included favourable outcome (mRS 0-2 at 90 days), EVT-related time metrics, and other clinical outcomes. Ordinary and binary logistic regression and linear regression were taken to adjust for confounding factors. RESULTS Of all 698 patients enrolled, 435 (62.3%) and 456 (65.3%) patients were categorised into the off-hour arrival and off-hour puncture group, respectively. Shorter onset to door time (adjusted ß coefficient: -21.56; 95% CI -39.96 to -3.16; p=0.022) was noted in the off-hour arrival group. Ordinal and dichotomous mRS scores at 90 days were comparable between the off-hour group and the on-hour group regardless of off-hour definitions. Other time metrics and outcomes were comparable between the two groups. Of 595 patients both presented and were treated during off-hour or on-hour, 394 patients were categorised into the true off-hour group and 201 into the true on-hour group. Time metrics and clinical outcomes were similar between the true off-hour and the true on-hour group. CONCLUSIONS The off-hour effect was not significant regarding clinical outcomes and in-hospital workflow in AC-LVO patients receiving EVT in this Chinese multicentre registry.","Zha, Mingming; Yang, Qingwen; Liu, Shuo; Huang, Kangmo; Zhang, Xiaohao; Wu, Min; Cai, Haodi; Lv, Qiushi; Liu, Rui; Yang, Dong; Liu, Xinfeng",Stroke and vascular neurology,https://doi.org/10.1136/svn-2021-000949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34244447/,427

78221,PCNP: A new era in shaping health policy.,2020-12-01,"OBJECTIVES Cirrhosis is often a consequence of substance use disorders (SUD) and can lead to significant morbidity, mortality, and hospitalizations. We aimed to determine presence and impact of SUD in recently hospitalized patients with cirrhosis, which has not been previously described. METHODS This is a retrospective study of consecutive patients with cirrhosis seen at a post-discharge hepatology clinic. The presence of clinically-recognized SUD and documented establishment of addiction treatment, as noted in routine clinical care, was determined through medical record review. Number of hospitalizations, 30-day readmissions, and all-cause mortality at 1 year were also examined. RESULTS Among 99 patients, 72% were male and the median age was 55 years. The most common etiologies of cirrhosis were alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C infection. Alcohol use disorder was documented in 71%. Nearly all patients with clinically-recognized SUD underwent social work evaluation during hospitalization and 65% were referred to addiction treatment. Establishment of addiction care at follow up was documented in 35%. Documented SUD was associated with greater odds of hospitalization over 1 year (adjusted odds ratio 5.77, 95% confidence interval [1.36, 24.49], P = 0.017), but not with 30-day readmissions or mortality. CONCLUSIONS Clinically-recognized SUD was common in recently hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and associated with at least 1 other hospitalization within a year. Establishment of addiction treatment was documented in only a minority of patients. Further research is needed to determine whether patients with cirrhosis and SUD experience unique barriers to addiction treatment and if integration of SUD care in hepatology settings may be beneficial.","Haque, Lamia Y; Jakab, Simona; Deng, Yanhong; Ciarleglio, Maria M; Tetrault, Jeanette M",Journal of addiction medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530887/,427
78292,"Why should nurses care if Heidegger was a Nazi? Pragmatics, politics and philosophy in nursing.",2021-05-05,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a global shift toward online distance learning due to travel limitations and physical distancing requirements as well as medical school and university closures. In low- and middle-income countries like Nepal, where medical education faces a range of challenges-such as lack of infrastructure, well-trained educators, and advanced technologies-the abrupt changes in methodologies without adequate preparation are more challenging than in higher income countries. In this article, the authors discuss the COVID-19-related changes and challenges in Nepal that may have a drastic impact on the career progression of current medical students. Outside the major cities, Nepal lacks dependable internet services to support medical education, which frequently requires access to and transmission of large files and audiovisual material. Thus, students who are poor, physically disadvantaged, and who do not have a home situation conducive to online study may be affected disproportionately. Further, the majority of teachers and students do not have sufficient logistical experience and knowledge to conduct or participate in online classes. Moreover, students and teachers are unsatisfied with the digital methodologies, which will ultimately hamper the quality of education. Students' clinical skills development, research activities, and live and intimate interactions with other individuals are being affected. Even though Nepal's medical education system is struggling to adapt to the transformation of teaching methodologies in the wake of the pandemic, it is important not to postpone the education of current medical students and future physicians during this crisis. Looking ahead, medical schools in Nepal should ensure that mechanisms are proactively put into place to embrace new educational opportunities and technologies to guarantee a regular supply of high-quality physicians capable of both responding effectively to any future pandemic and satisfying the nation's future health care needs.","Sigdel, Shailendra; Ozaki, Akihiko; Dhakal, Rachana; Pradhan, Bishwas; Tanimoto, Tetsuya",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003888; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33332910/,427

To investigate the contribution of furin-mediated gB cleavage to EHV-1 growth, canonical furin cleavage sites were mutated. Western blot analysis of mutated EHV-1 gB showed that it was cleaved at two positions, 518RRRR521 and 544RLHK547, and that the 28 aa between the two sites were removed after cleavage. Treating infected cells with either convertase or furin inhibitors reduced gB cleavage efficiency. Further, removal of the first furin recognition motif did not affect in vitro growth of EHV-1, while mutation of the second motif greatly affected virus growth. In addition, a second possible signal peptide cleavage site was identified for EHV-1 gB between residues 98 and 99, which was 13 aa downstream of that previously identified.","Spiesschaert, Bart; Stephanowitz, Heike; Krause, Eberhard; Osterrieder, Nikolaus; Azab, Walid",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000418; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26843465/,427
79412,Estimating the time interval between transmission generations when negative values occur in the serial interval data: using COVID-19 as an example.,2020-05-11,"The widespread use of remifentanil during total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) has raised concerns about the risk of postoperative remifentanil-associated pain. Although a recent meta-analysis suggests that remifentanil-associated pain is unlikely to occur in patients with TIVA because of the protective effect of co-administered propofol, the evidence is not conclusive. We retrospectively assessed 635 patients who received robotic thyroid surgery under TIVA to evaluate the risk of remifentanil-associated pain. Postoperative pain was evaluated using 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS). Time dependent Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors of treatment-requiring pain (NRS > 4) during the first 48 postoperative hours. Postoperative pain rapidly decreased, and treatment-requiring pain remained in 12.8% (81 out of 635) of patients at 48 hours postoperatively. After adjusting for the time-dependent analgesic consumption, intraoperative use of remifentanil > 0.2 mcg/kg/min was a positive predictor of postoperative pain with a hazard ratio of 1.296 (95% C.I., 1.014-1.656, P = 0.039) during 48 hours after surgery. In conclusion, excessive use of remifentanil during TIVA was associated with increased risk of pain after robotic thyroid surgery. Prospective trials are required to confirm these results and determine whether decreasing remifentanil consumption below the threshold can reduce postoperative pain.","Lee, Hyung-Chul; Ryu, Ho-Geol; Kim, Hyung-Jun; Park, Yoonsang; Yoon, Soo Bin; Yang, Seong Mi; Oh, Hye-Won; Jung, Chul-Woo",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30550587/,427

As diabetes and obesity are the major causes of graft failure and post-transplant complication, it is important to manage obesity in patients with renal transplant. Herein, we report a case of a morbidly obese renal-transplant patient with poorly controlled diabetes who received bariatric surgery. A 34-year-old obese Taiwanese man with type 2 diabetes had end-stage renal disease that had progressed since 2008, when he had commenced hemodialysis (January 2008) and had a renal transplant (July 2008). Because of persistent obesity and poorly controlled diabetes, he received LRYGB at Chiayi Christian hospital on 18 August 2010. In the month that followed, he lost 10 kg. His serum creatinine decreased to 1.11 mg/dL (1.4 mg/dL, preoperative) and his hemoglobin A1c decreased to 8.5% (10.4%, preoperative). These results indicate that, in obese renal transplant patients, LRYGB may be employed to treat obesity, control diabetes and stabilize or improve the renal function.","Sung, T C; Lee, W J; Yu, H I; Tu, C W; Chiang, C C; Liao, C S",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1758-5910.2011.00095.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22776307/,427

84612,Interval exercise induces milder respiratory responses compared to continuous exercise.,2020-01-29,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to describe the presentation and outcomes of horses with signs of colic (abdominal pain) seen 'out-of-hours' in equine practice. METHODS This was a retrospective study of horses seen 'out-of-hours' with colic by two equine veterinary practices between 2011 and 2013. Case outcomes were categorised as 'critical' or 'not critical'. A critical outcome was defined as requiring medical or surgical hospital treatment, or resulting in euthanasia or death. A non-critical outcome was defined as resolving with simple medical treatment. A hierarchical generalised linear model was used to identify 'red flag' parameters (aspects of signalment, history and presenting clinical signs) associated with critical outcomes. RESULTS Data were retrieved from 941 cases that presented with colic; 23.9 per cent (n=225/941) were critical. Variables significantly associated with the likelihood of a critical outcome in the final multivariable model were increased heart rate (P<0.001), age of the horse (P=0.013) and abnormal mucous membrane colour (P<0.001). Overall 18 per cent (n=168/941) of cases were euthanased. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the mortality associated with colic.

This clinical trial sought to determine if a multicomponent intervention protocol, including manual tooth/gum brushing plus 0.12% chlorhexidine oral rinse, twice per day, plus upright positioning during feeding, could reduce the incidence of radiographically documented pneumonia among nursing home residents, compared with usual care. METHODS This cluster-randomized clinical trial was conducted in 36 nursing homes in Connecticut. Eligible residents >65 years with at least 1 of 2 modifiable risk factors for pneumonia (ie, impaired oral hygiene, swallowing difficulty) were enrolled. Nursing homes were randomized to the multicomponent intervention protocol or usual care. Participants were followed for up to 2.5 years for development of the primary outcome, a radiographically documented pneumonia, and secondary outcome, a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) without radiographic documentation. RESULTS A total of 834 participants were enrolled: 434 to intervention and 400 to usual care. The trial was terminated for futility. The number of participants in the intervention vs control arms with first pneumonia was 119 (27.4%) vs 94 (23.5%), respectively, and with first LRTI, 125 (28.8%) vs 100 (25.0%), respectively. In a multivariable Cox regression model, the hazard ratio in the intervention vs control arms, respectively, was 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI], .84-1.50; P = .44) for first pneumonia and 1.07 (95% CI, .79-1.46, P = .65) for first LRTI.

86494,Disinfecting Gamma Gantry during the Coronavirus Pandemic: Another Area 51.,2020-08-04,"PURPOSE Incidental solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) have become an increasingly common CT finding worldwide. Although there are currently many imaging strategies for evaluating SPNs, the differential diagnosis and management of SPNs remains complex because of overlap between benign and malignant processes. Moreover, transbronchial or percutaneous CT-guided biopsies do not always allow definitive diagnoses. In such cases, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has become the preferred surgical procedure for diagnosis and, in selected cases, for treatment of indeterminate SPNs. The difficulties in localizing smaller, deeper, and ground-glass nodules have been approached with different techniques. The aim of this study was to report 20 years of experience with radioguided thoracoscopic resection of SPNs at the Regional Centre of Nuclear Medicine of Pisa. METHODS Three hundred ninety-five patients with SPNs less than 2 cm and deeper than 5 mm below the visceral pleura underwent CT-guided injection of a suspension composed of 0.1 to 0.2 mL Tc-labeled human albumin macroaggregates (Tc-MAA) and of 0.2 to 0.3 mL of nonionic contrast medium into or adjacent to the SPN. During VATS, the pulmonary area with the highest target/background ratio identified by an 11-mm-diameter collimated thoracoscopic gamma probe was resected. RESULTS From 1997 to 2016, approximately 395 patients with SPN underwent VATS wedge resection using the radioguided technique. Mean SPN size was 13 mm (range, 5-20 mm) with mean distance of 15 mm (range, 6-39 mm) from the visceral pleura. Mean VATS procedural time was 40 minutes (range, 20-90 minutes), with an average time of 3 minutes (range, 1-5 minutes) to localize the nodule. Neither mortality nor major perioperative complication was reported. The success rate of VATS with radioguidance in our series was 99%. Histological examination revealed 206 benign lesions (52%), 59 primary lung tumors (15%), and 130 metastatic nodules (33%). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that radioguided SPN localization by VATS is a feasible, safe, and rapid procedure with highly successful rate of SPN resection.","Manca, Gianpiero; Davini, Federico; Tardelli, Elisa; De Liperi, Annalisa; Falaschi, Fabio; Melfi, Franca; Colletti, Patrick M; Rubello, Domenico; Volterrani, Duccio; Boni, Giuseppe",Clinical nuclear medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/rlu.0000000000001997; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29432343/,427

We used stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy to study the organization of actin, spectrin, and associated proteins in neurons. Actin formed ringlike structures that wrapped around the circumference of axons and were evenly spaced along axonal shafts with a periodicity of ~180 to 190 nanometers. This periodic structure was not observed in dendrites, which instead contained long actin filaments running along dendritic shafts. Adducin, an actin-capping protein, colocalized with the actin rings. Spectrin exhibited periodic structures alternating with those of actin and adducin, and the distance between adjacent actin-adducin rings was comparable to the length of a spectrin tetramer. Sodium channels in axons were distributed in a periodic pattern coordinated with the underlying actin-spectrin-based cytoskeleton.","Xu, Ke; Zhong, Guisheng; Zhuang, Xiaowei",Science,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1232251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23239625/,427
86838,Genomic Insights into waste valorized extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by Bacillus sp. ISTL8.,2020-10-15,"BACKGROUND/AIMS We recently described a novel regulatory role for histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) in protecting endothelial cells from oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL)-induced injury. In this study, we examined the effects of endothelial-specific HDAC2 overexpression on endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation and atherogenesis in vivo. METHODS Endothelial-specific HDAC2-overexpressing transgenic mice (HDAC2-Tg) were generated under control of the Tie2 promoter. An atherosclerosis model was produced by injecting HDAC2-Tg and wild-type (WT) mice with adeno-associated virus encoding a PCSK9 gain-of-function mutant under control of a liver-specific promoter and feeding them a high-fat diet for 12 weeks. Aortic stiffness in vivo was determined by measuring pulse wave velocity. Wire myography was used to measure endothelium dependent (acetylcholine) and independent (sodium nitroprusside) relaxation in isolated mice aortas. Atherosclerotic plaque burden in aortas was determined by Oil Red O staining and protein expression was determined by western blotting. RESULTS At baseline, HDAC2-Tg mice had normal mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and body weight, but pulse wave velocity (PWV), an inverse measure of vascular health and stiffness, was decreased, suggesting that their vessels were more compliant. Moreover, basal nitric oxide production was enhanced in the vessels of HDAC2-Tg mice as compared to that in WT controls, although no significant differences in acetylcholine (endothelial component)- or sodium nitroprusside (non-endothelial component)-mediated relaxation were observed. However, after exposure to OxLDL, aortas from HDAC2-Tg mice exhibited greater acetylcholine-induced relaxation than did those from WT mice. Thus, endothelial-specific vasodilator production was enhanced despite oxidative injury. Atherosclerosis induction in WT mice led to a significant increase in PWV, but in HDAC2-Tg mice, PWV and MAP remained unchanged. Further, aortic rings from HDAC2-Tg exhibited better endothelial-dependent vascular relaxation than did those from WT mice, but not when treated with nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME. Finally, plaque burden, determined by Oil red O staining, was significantly increased in WT, but not HDAC2-Tg mice, subjected to the atherogenic model. Deletion of endothelial HDAC2 led to impaired endothelial cell-dependent vascular relaxation and increased PWV, compared with those in littermate controls. CONCLUSION HDAC2 protects against endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis induced by oxidized lipids. Hence, overexpression or activation of HDAC2 represents a novel therapy for endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. HDAC2-Tg mice provide an opportunity to determine the role of endothelial HDAC2 in vascular endothelial homeostasis.","Hori, Daijiro; Nomura, Yohei; Nakano, Mitsunori; Han, Mingming; Bhatta, Anil; Chen, Ke; Akiyoshi, Kei; Pandey, Deepesh","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",https://doi.org/10.33594/000000280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975918/,427

In viral diseases, an ambiguous function of regulatory T cells (Treg), with both beneficial effects by reducing immunopathology and detrimental effects by inhibiting antiviral immunity, has been described. However, the role of Treg in the pathogenesis of canine distemper remains unknown. In order to determine the effect of CDV upon immune homeostasis, the amount of Foxp3(+) Treg in spleen and brain of naturally infected dogs has been determined by immunohistochemistry. In addition, splenic cytokine expression has been quantified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Splenic depletion of Foxp3(+) Treg was associated with an increased mRNA-expression of tumor necrosis factor and decreased transcription of interleukin-2 in the acute disease phase, indicative of disturbed immunological counter regulation in peripheral lymphoid organs. In the brain, a lack of Foxp3(+) Treg in predemyelinating and early demyelinating lesions and significantly increased infiltrations of Foxp3(+) Treg in chronic demyelinating lesions were observed. In conclusion, disturbed peripheral and CNS immune regulation associated with a reduction of Treg represents a potential prerequisite for excessive neuroinflammation and early lesion development in canine distemper leukoencephalitis.","Qeska, V; Barthel, Y; Iseringhausen, M; Tipold, A; Stein, V M; Khan, M A; Baumgärtner, W; Beineke, A",Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.10.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24210687/,427

Cases of infection due to the measles virus are rapidly increasing and yet current diagnostic tools used to monitor for the virus rely on slow (>1 hour) technologies. Here, we demonstrate the first biosensor capable of detecting the measles virus in minutes with no preprocessing steps. The key sensing element is an electrode coated with a self-assembled monolayer containing the measles antibody, immobilized through an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC). The intact virus is detected by changes in resistance, giving a linear response to 10-100 µg/mL of the intact measles virus without the need to label or process the sample. The limit of detection is 6 µg/mL, which is at the lower limit of concentrations that can cause infections in primates. The NHC-based biosensors are shown to be superior to thiol-based systems, producing an approximately 10x larger response and significantly greater stability towards repeated measurements and long-term storage. This NHC-based biosensor thus represents an important development for both the rapid detection of the measles virus and as a platform technology for the detection of other biological targets of interest.","Mayall, Robert M; Smith, Christene; Hyla, Alexander S; Lee, Dianne S; Crudden, Cathleen M; Birss, Viola Ingrid",ACS sensors,https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.0c01250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32820626/,427

On each trial a single numeral (the probe) was presented and the instructions were to respond as to whether it signified a quantity less than or greater than five (the standard). In separate blocks of trials, the numerals were presented either in Mandarin or in Arabic number formats. In addition to the standard influence of numerical distance, a significant predictor of performance was the degree of physical similarity between the probe and the standard as depicted in Mandarin. Additionally, competing effects of physical similarity, defined in terms of the Arabic number format, were also found. Critically the size of these different effects of physical similarity varied systematically across individuals such that larger effects of one compensated for smaller effects of the other. It is argued that the data favor accounts of processing that assume that different number formats access different format-specific representations of quantities. Moreover, for Chinese participants the default is to translate numerals into a Mandarin format prior to accessing quantity information. The efficacy of this translation process is itself influenced by a competing tendency to carry out a translation into Arabic format.","Quinlan, Philip T; Cohen, Dale J; Liu, Xingyu",Memory & cognition,https://doi.org/10.3758/s13421-020-01065-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648174/,427

We explored the emotions, perceived stressors, and coping strategies of healthcare workers who worked during a MERS-CoV outbreak in our hospital. DESIGN A cross-sectional descriptive survey design. SETTING A tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS HCWs (150) who worked in high risk areas during the April-May 2014 MERS-CoV outbreak that occurred in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS We developed and administered a ""MERS-CoV staff questionnaire"" to study participants. The questionnaire consisted of 5 sections with 72 questions. The sections evaluated hospital staffs emotions, perceived stressors, factors that reduced their stress, coping strategies, and motivators to work during future outbreaks. Responses were scored on a scale from 0-3. The varying levels of stress or effectiveness of measures were reported as mean and standard deviation, as appropriate. RESULTS Completed questionnaires were returned by 117 (78%) of the participants. The results had many unique elements. HCWs ethical obligation to their profession pushed them to continue with their jobs. The main sentiments centered upon fear of personal safety and well-being of colleagues and family. Positive attitudes in the workplace, clinical improvement of infected colleagues, and stoppage of disease transmission among HCWs after adopting strict protective measures alleviated their fear and drove them through the epidemic. They appreciated recognition of their efforts by hospital management and expected similar acknowledgment, infection control guidance, and equipment would entice them to work during future epidemics. CONCLUSION The MERS-CoV outbreak was a distressing time for our staff.

RECENT FINDINGS Recent guidelines on the use of CT scans in COVID-19 vary between countries. However, the consensus is that it should not be used as the first line; a notion supported by the WHO. Currently, several investigations are being used including reverse transcription PCR testing, chest radiographs, and ultrasound scans, and CT scans. They are ideally performed later during the disease process as the sensitivity and specificity are highest by that time. Typical COVID-19 features on CT scans vary but include vascular enlargement, ground-glass opacities, and ground glass opacification together with consolidation. SUMMARY Since COVID-19 was declared as a global pandemic, there was a push towards identifying appropriate diagnostic tests that are both reliable and effective. There is a general agreement that CT scans have a high sensitivity but low specificity in diagnosing COVID-19. However, the quality of available studies is not optimal, so this must always be interpreted with the clinical context in mind.

93512,Ethics in Surgical Innovations from the Patient Perspective.,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND Home-based cardiac telerehabilitation (HBCT) is a feasible and effective alternative to traditional center-based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR). Currently, there are only limited studies focusing on a long-term effect of HBCT, which means it is essential to do more research in this study field. AIM This study aimed at investigating a 1-year effect of a randomized controlled study using Cardiac Rehabilitation through the Global Position System (CR-GPS) compared to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. Study focused on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with coronary heart disease (CAD). DESIGN A long-term follow-up of a randomized study. SETTING Patients were enrolled, and the intervention was performed in an outpatient or homebased model. The results were obtained and evaluated in a hospital. POPULATION Patients who participated in the CR-GPS study were diagnosed with CAD with low to moderate cardiovascular risk. METHODS Patients enrolled in the study were eligible participants who had previously completed a 12-week HBCT program using a wrist heart rate (HR) monitor or attended a traditional CBCR. Primary outcome was the change in CRF expressed in peak oxygen uptake (pVO2), and the secondary outcomes were self-reported HRQL, objectively measured anthropometric characteristics, and mortality and hospitalization rates. RESULTS 44 patients (76%) completed the long-term follow-up. The average peak of pVO2 was higher after 1-year follow-up in the telerehabilitation group (HBCT 25.5 ml / kg / min compared to the active control group CBCR 23.6 ml / kg / min p = 0.047). No statistically significant difference between the two groups was found after long-term follow-up for the parameter HRQL. For both groups, there was a significant improvement in the range of perceptions of general health. There was no death case and no difference in hospitalization rate between the groups. CONCLUSIONS This study supports the HBCT model. It has been demonstrated that it induces satisfactory long-term effects in pVO2, exercise performance, and perceived general health in CAD patients with low to moderate cardiovascular risk. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT Cardiovascular telerehabilitation using wrist HR monitors is a feasible and effective rehabilitation method that can help patients eliminate barriers that prevent them from using CBCR programs. Especially in the current global situation with the COVID-19 pandemic, this topic is becoming increasingly important.","Batalik, Ladislav; Dosbaba, Filip; Hartman, Martin; Konecny, Vladimir; Batalikova, Katerina; Spinar, Jindrich",European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,https://doi.org/10.23736/s1973-9087.21.06653-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619944/,427

Despite evidence for sex differences in the development and maintenance of stimulant use disorder, few studies have focused on mechanisms underpinning distinct trajectories in females versus males, including the effect of the ovarian sex hormones estrogen and progesterone. This review aimed to identify and synthesise the existing preclinical and clinical literature on the effect of ovarian sex hormones on stimulant consumption in females. A systematic search of peer-reviewed literature identified 1593 articles, screened using the following inclusion criteria: (1) adult female humans or animals, (2) using stimulant drugs, (3) ovarian sex hormones were administered exogenously OR were measured in a validated manner and (4) with stimulant consumption as an outcome measure. A total of 50 studies (3 clinical and 47 preclinical) met inclusion criteria. High-estrogen (low progesterone) phases of the menstrual/estrus cycle were associated with increased stimulant use in preclinical studies, while there were no clinical studies examining estrogen and stimulant consumption. Consistent preclinical evidence supported progesterone use reducing stimulant consumption, which was also identified in one clinical study. The review was limited by inconsistent data reporting across studies and different protocols across preclinical laboratory paradigms. Importantly, almost all studies examined cocaine use, with impact on methamphetamine use a significant gap in the existing evidence. Given the safety and tolerability profile of progesterone, further research is urgently needed to address this gap, to explore the potential therapeutic utility of progesterone as a treatment for stimulant use disorder.","Arunogiri, Shalini; Crossin, Rose; Rizzo, Davinia; Walker, Leigh; Ridley, Kelly; Gurvich, Caroline",Addiction biology,https://doi.org/10.1111/adb.13079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34374475/,427

We reveal that, in normoxia, enzymatic action of cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) produces H2S, which persulfidates prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) at residues Cys21 and Cys33 (zinc finger motif), augmenting prolyl hydroxylase activity. Depleting endogenous H2S either by hypoxia or by inhibiting CBS via chemical or genetic means reduces persulfidation of PHD2 and inhibits activity, preventing hydroxylation of HIF-1α, resulting in stabilization. Our in vitro findings are further supported by the depletion of CBS in the zebrafish model that exhibits axis defects and abnormal intersegmental vessels. Exogenous H2S supplementation rescues both in vitro and in vivo phenotypes. We have identified the persulfidated residues and defined their functional significance in regulating the activity of PHD2 via point mutations. Thus, the CBS/H2S/PHD2 axis may provide therapeutic opportunities for pathologies associated with HIF-1α dysregulation in chronic diseases.","Dey, Anindya; Prabhudesai, Shubhangi; Zhang, Yushan; Rao, Geeta; Thirugnanam, Karthikeyan; Hossen, Md Nazir; Dwivedi, Shailendra Kumar Dhar; Ramchandran, Ramani; Mukherjee, Priyabrata; Bhattacharya, Resham",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz8534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937467/,427

BACKGROUND Health inequity is a systemic and longstanding concern with dire consequences that can have marked effects on the lives of minority patients. As a result of the unequal consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the magnitude of the outcomes from health inequity in all spheres of American health care is being brought to the fore. The discourse within athletic training practice and policy must shift to intentionally creating strategies that acknowledge and account for systemic health inequities in order to facilitate an informed, evidence-based, and safe return to sport within the new normal. CONCLUSIONS To continue to evolve the profession and solidify athletic trainers' role in public health spaces post-COVID-19, professionals at all levels of athletic training practice and policy must intentionally create strategies that acknowledge and account for not only the social determinants of health but also the effects of racism and childhood trauma on overall health and well-being.","Noel-London, Kemba Ceronne; Grimsley, Crystal; Porter, Jessie; Breitbach, Anthony P",Journal of athletic training,https://doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-0350.20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33290542/,427

According to the WHO, there is an increased risk of dementia or other cognitive disorders as the population ages, which have a major impact on public health. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is described as a greater than expected cognitive decline for an individual's age and level of education, but that does not significantly interfere with activities of daily living. Patients with MCI exhibit a higher risk of dementia compared with others in the same age group, but without a cognitive decline, have impaired walking and a 50% greater risk of falling.The urban lifestyle and advent of smartphones, mobility and immediate access to all information via the internet, including health information, has led to a totally disruptive change in most general aspects.This systematic review protocol is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of technology-based interventions in the detection, prevention, monitoring and treatment of patients at risk or diagnosed with MCI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This review protocol follows the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols reporting guidelines. The search will be performed on MEDLINE (PubMed), CENTRAL, CINAHL Plus, ISI Web of Science and Scopus databases from 2010 to 2020. Studies of interventions either randomised clinical trials or pre-post non-randomised quasi-experimental designs, published in English and Spanish will be included. Articles that provide relevant information on the use of technology and its effectiveness in interventions that assess improvements in early detection, prevention, follow-up and treatment of the patients at risk or diagnosed with MCI will be included.

97135,Covid-19: Three tier alert system takes effect across England.,2020-10-13,"In response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the Hospital Pharmacy Services have quickly adapted to respond to a critical situation characterized by the constant and continuous admission of patients with severe pneumonia who needed treatment, requiring a transformation of the hospital in order to increase the number of hospital and critical beds. Moreover, other out-ofhospital spaces have been transformed into hospitalization units to absorb the large number of patients that had to be treated and isolated. To guarantee the distribution of medicines and the quality of the pharmaceutical care, drug distribution systems, such as unit dose and automated dispensing systems, have undergone transformations. Standard stocks were assigned for COVID units, and different dispensing circuits to avoid the risk of cross-contamination between COVID and non-COVID units were created, as well as disinfection protocols for medication transport systems and medication return protocols. All this without forgetting COVID treatment protocol's changes that were affected by the availability of the drugs. The increase in the number of beds in out-of-hospital spaces, such as field hospitals, hotels, socio-medical centers and nursing homes, has challenged Pharmacy Services, since new medication dispensing and conciliation circuits have been created forcing the increase of pharmacy staff's presence and modifying work shifts, to afford all the new tasks successfully. Development of contingency plans for the different Pharmacy Service activities and providing fluent communication channels are key elements for crisis situations or health emergencies such as the current pandemic.","Cabañas, Maria Josep; Queralt Gorgas, Maria",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,https://doi.org/10.7399/fh.11495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32533672/,427
97307,The Coronavirus Pandemic 1 Year On-What Went Wrong?,2021-03-23,"BACKGROUND The impacts of COVID-19 on lung allograft function, rejection, secondary infection, and clinical outcomes in lung transplant recipients (LTRs) remain unknown. METHODS A 1:2 matched case-control study was performed to evaluate re-hospitalization, lung allograft function, and secondary infections up to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis (or index dates for controls). RESULTS Twenty-four LTRs with COVID-19 (cases) and 48 controls were identified. Cases and controls had similar baseline characteristics and lung allograft function. LTRs with COVID-19 had higher incidence of secondary bacterial infection (29.2% vs 6.3%, p = 0.008), readmission (29.2% vs 10.4%, p = 0.04), and for-cause bronchoscopy (33.3% vs 12.5%, p = 0.04) compared to controls. At day 90, mortality in cases vs controls was 8.3 vs 2.1% (p = 0.21), incidence of invasive fungal infections in cases vs controls was 20.8% vs 8.3% (p = 0.13) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) decline ≥ 10% from baseline occurred in 19% of cases vs 12.2% of controls (p= 0.46). No acute cellular rejection, acute antibody mediated rejection, or new donor specific anti-HLA antibodies were observed among cases or controls within 90 days post index date. CONCLUSIONS We found LTRs with COVID-19 were at risk to develop secondary infections and re-hospitalization post COVID-19, compared to controls. While we did not observe post -viral ACR or AMR, further studies are needed to understand if LTRs with COVID-19 who did not recover baseline lung function within 90 days have developed chronic lung allograft dysfunction stage progression.","Permpalung, Nitipong; Bazemore, Katrina; Chiang, Teresa Po-Yu; Mathew, Joby; Barker, Lindsay; Nematollahi, Saman; Cochran, Willa; Sait, Afrah S; Avery, Robin K; Shah, Pali D",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075005/,427

Observations and inflammatory markers were normal, and an ultrasound scan was inconclusive. A provisional diagnosis of non-specific abdominal pain or early appendicitis was made, and she was discharged with safety netting advice. She presented again 6 days later with ongoing abdominal pain now associated with multiple episodes of vomiting; hence, the decision was made to proceed to diagnostic laparoscopy rather than a magnetic resonance scan for further assessment. Intraoperative findings revealed 200 mL of serous fluid in the pelvis, normal-looking appendix, dilated stomach and a tangle of small bowel loops. Blunt and careful dissection revealed fistulous tracts that magnetised the laparoscopic instruments. A minilaparotomy was performed with the extraction of 14 magnetic beads and the repair of nine enterotomies.

OBJECTIVES The purpose of the study was to determine biologic variation, index of individuality, and reference change values (RCV) for specific feline pancreatic lipase concentrations (Spec fPL) in apparently healthy cats. METHODS Four blood samples were collected prospectively from 12 apparently healthy cats at 2-week intervals. The Spec fPL was measured in all serum samples by a reference laboratory. RESULTS Intra-individual variation for Spec fPL was 33.5% (95% CI 27.1-43.8%); inter-individual variation was 99.9% (69.2-169.9%) and analytic variation was 7.3% (6.1-9.2%). Reciprocal index of individuality for Spec fPL was 2.9 (2.5-3.8), the 2-sided RCV was 95.1% (77.0-123.9%). CONCLUSIONS Due to high individuality, use of a population-based RI for Spec fPL may fail to detect clinically significant elevations in individual cats. The use of subject-based RIs for Spec fPL may have greater sensitivity for the detection of a change in pancreatic physiology in cats; however, this would require serial assessment of apparently healthy cats.","Cohn-Urbach, Margaret; Ruaux, Craig G; Nemanic, Sarah",Veterinary clinical pathology,https://doi.org/10.1111/vcp.12528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28741302/,427

Having proven its effectiveness in cholecystectomy and appendectomy, the feasibility of SILS in more advanced surgery, such as hemicolectomy and low anterior resection, is now a point of discussion. METHODS This study reports on the results of the first 50 SILS colorectal operations at our institution. Twenty right hemicolectomies, 16 sigmoid resections, 9 low anterior resections, and 5 total colectomies were performed. Nineteen patients were operated for benign colonic diseases, 31 for malignant disease. RESULTS Mean operative time was 130 min, and the median duration of postoperative hospital stay was 6 days. None of the procedures needed conversion to a laparotomy, but four patients were converted to a multiport laparoscopy. In one case, an anastomotic leakage occurred, which was treated by creating a diverting ileostomy laparoscopically. Minor complications were four wound infections and two incisional hernias. CONCLUSION SILS colectomy is a safe and feasible procedure even in more complex cases. Comparative studies are needed to demonstrate advantages over traditional laparoscopic surgery.","van den Boezem, Peter B; Sietses, Colin",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-011-1626-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21796459/,427
103300,Are there predictors of flexible ureteroscopic aptitude among novice trainees? objective assessment using simulation-based trainer.,2021-10-04,"Introduction Recent data suggest that statin use after intracerebral haemorrhage might be beneficial. However, data on the effects of early in-hospital statin exposure are lacking. Therefore, we sought to assess whether (1) early statin exposure during the acute phase after intracerebral haemorrhage and (2) early continuation of prevalent statin use are associated with favourable functional outcome. Patients and methods Data were obtained from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive. Patients were categorised according to use patterns of statins during this early in-hospital phase (continuation, discontinuation or new initiation of statins). Univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted to explore the association between early statin exposure and functional outcome. Results A total of 919 patients were included in the analysis. Early in-hospital statin exposure (n = 89, 9.7%) was associated with better functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤ 3) compared with 790 patients without statin exposure before or early after the event (66% versus 47%, adjusted OR 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.3-3.6). Compared with patients without exposure to statins before and early after the event, early continuation of statin therapy (n = 57) was associated with favourable functional outcome (adjusted odds ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-5.2). The association between early continuation of statins and outcome remained robust in sensitivity analyses restricted to patients able to take oral medication within 72 h and one-week survivors. Discussion It is possible that part of the observed associations are not due to a protective effect of statins but are confounded by indication bias. Conclusion Statin exposure and continuation of prevalent statin therapy early after intracerebral haemorrhage are associated with favourable functional outcome after 90 days.","Doerrfuss, Jakob I; Abdul-Rahim, Azmil H; Siegerink, Bob; Nolte, Christian H; Lees, Kennedy R; Endres, Matthias; Kasner, Scott E; Scheitz, Jan F",European stroke journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2396987319889258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32232174/,427
103586,Flipped learning: A shift in graduate nursing education.,2021-03-12,"OBJECTIVELiquid embolic agents have revolutionized endovascular management of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). Nonetheless, since 2005, the US FDA has received more than 100 reports of microcatheter breakage or entrapment related to Onyx embolization, including 9 deaths. In 2014, the Apollo detachable-tip microcatheter became the first of its kind available in the US. Since then, few reports on its safety have been published.METHODSThe authors conducted a retrospective review of endovascular cases by searching the patient databases at 2 tertiary cerebrovascular centers (Barrow Neurological Institute and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center). Patients who underwent endovascular embolization of an AVM or AVF using the Apollo microcatheter were identified. Patient demographics and lesion characteristics were collected. The authors analyzed Apollo-specific endovascular variables, such as number of microcatheterizations, sessions, and pedicles embolized; microcatheter tip detachment status; obliteration rate; and endovascular- and microcatheter-related morbidity and mortality.RESULTSFrom July 2014 to October 2016, a total of 177 embolizations using the Apollo microcatheter were performed in 61 patients (mean age 40.3 years). The most frequent presentation was hemorrhage (22/61, 36.1%). Most lesions were AVMs (51/61, 83.6%; mean diameter 30.6 mm). The mean Spetzler-Martin grade was 2.4. Thirty-nine (76.5%) of 51 patients with AVMs underwent resection. Microcatheterization was successful in 172 pedicles. Most patients (50/61, 82%) underwent a single embolization session. The mean number of pedicles per session was 2.5 (range 1-7). Onyx-18 was used in 103 (59.9%), N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) in 44 (25.6%), and Onyx-34 in 25 (14.5%) of the 172 embolizations. In 45.9% (28/61) of the patients, lesion obliteration of 75% or greater was achieved. Tip detachment occurred in 19.2% (33/172) of microcatheters. Fifty-three (86.9%) of the 61 patients who underwent embolization with the Apollo microcatheter had good functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2). No unintended microcatheter fractures or related morbidity was observed. One patient died of intraprocedural complications unrelated to microcatheter selection. In the univariate analysis, microcatheter tip detachment (p = 0.12), single embolized pedicles (p = 0.12), and smaller AVM nidus diameter (p = 0.17) correlated positively with high obliteration rates (> 90%). In the multivariate analysis, microcatheter tip detachment was the only independent variable associated with high obliteration rates (OR 9.5; p = 0.03).CONCLUSIONSThe use of the Apollo detachable-tip microcatheter for embolization of AVMs and AVFs is associated with high rates of successful catheterization and obliteration and low rates of morbidity and mortality. The microcatheter was retrieved in all cases, even after prolonged injections in distal branch pedicles, often with significant reflux. This study represents the largest case series on the application of the Apollo microcatheter for neurointerventional procedures.","Flores, Bruno C; See, Alfred P; Weiner, Gregory M; Jankowitz, Brian T; Ducruet, Andrew F; Albuquerque, Felipe C",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2017.9.jns17397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29570006/,427

The coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein initiates infection by promoting fusion of the viral and cellular membranes through conformational changes that remain largely uncharacterized. Here we report the cryoEM structure of a coronavirus S glycoprotein in the postfusion state, showing large-scale secondary, tertiary, and quaternary rearrangements compared with the prefusion trimer and rationalizing the free-energy landscape of this conformational machine. We also biochemically characterized the molecular events associated with refolding of the metastable prefusion S glycoprotein to the postfusion conformation using limited proteolysis, mass spectrometry, and single-particle EM. The observed similarity between postfusion coronavirus S and paramyxovirus F structures demonstrates that a conserved refolding trajectory mediates entry of these viruses and supports the evolutionary relatedness of their fusion subunits. Finally, our data provide a structural framework for understanding the mode of neutralization of antibodies targeting the fusion machinery and for engineering next-generation subunit vaccines or inhibitors against this medically important virus family.","Walls, Alexandra C; Tortorici, M Alejandra; Snijder, Joost; Xiong, Xiaoli; Bosch, Berend-Jan; Rey, Felix A; Veesler, David",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1708727114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29073020/,427

METHODS COVID-19 patients admitted in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 22, 2020 to April 11, 2020 were retrospectively scrolled. The enrolled patients were those with confirmed diagnosis of severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia, who received HDIVC within 24 hours after disease aggravation. Main clinical outcomes obtained from 3-5 days (day 3) and 7-10 days (day 7) after HDIVC were compared to the ones just before (day 0) HDIVC. RESULTS Totally, twelve patients were enrolled including six severe [age of mean, 56; interquartile range (IQR), 32-65 years, 3 men] and six critical (age of mean, 63; IQR, 60-82 years, 4 men) patients. The dosage of vitamin C [median (IQR), mg/kg (body weight)/day] were [162.7 (71.1-328.6)] for severe and [178.6 (133.3-350.6)] for critical patients. By Generalized estimating equation (GEE) model, C-reactive protein (CRP) was found to decrease significantly from day 0 to 3 and 7 (severe: 59.01±37.9, 12.36±22.12, 8.95±20.4; critical: 92.5±41.21, 33.9±30.2, 59.56±41.4 mg/L). Lymphocyte and CD4+ T cell counts in severe patients reached to normal level since day 3. Similar improving trends were observed for PaO2/FiO2 (severe: 209.3±111.7, 313.4±146, 423.3±140.8; critical: 119.9±52.7, 201.8±86.64, 190.5±51.99) and sequential organ failure assessment score (severe: 2.83±1.72, 1.33±1.63, 0.67±1.03; critical: 6.67±2.34, 4.17±2.32, 3.83±2.56). Better improving effect was observed in severe than critical patients after HDIVC. CONCLUSIONS HDIVC might be beneficial in aspects of inflammatory response, immune and organ function for aggravation of COVID-19 patients. Further clinical trials are in warrant.

108586,Considerations for Artificial Intelligence Real-World Implementation in Ophthalmology: Providers' and Patients' Perspectives.,2021,"INTRODUCTION COVID-19 remains pandemic with countries scrambling to mass vaccinate populations, prioritising health-care workers, the elderly and the vulnerable. Malta is a small Mediterranean country with a population of circa half a million with free healthcare at point-of-care. This paper reviews the adaptations made to cope with mass vaccination. METHODS Permission was obtained to tour hospital facilities. Photographs were taken with and edited on a mobile phone, a previously utilised methodology. RESULTS Vaccination commenced on 27/12/20 with priorities as above. Malta Medical School lecture halls were initially used, followed by outpatients at the country's regional hospital, as well as other lecture halls, and National Health Service clinics. Virtually all medically vulnerable individuals have had their first doses as well as most individuals ≥60 years of age, with the 55-60 year age group currently targeted. Malta is well ahead of the European Union average. DISCUSSION Exacting logistics and cooperation by all local authorities (such as the University of Malta) has resulted in a highly successful vaccine rollout. The eventual licencing of vaccination for children and the availability of booster dose/s will further facilitate the eventual attainment of herd immunity. This must be a global effort lest escape variants render these efforts futile.","Grech, Victor; Souness, Jorgen; Agius, Steve",Journal of visual communication in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17453054.2021.1920829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973833/,427
109917,"Response to COVID-19 in Taiwan: Big Data Analytics, New Technology, and Proactive Testing.",2020-03-03,"For decades, several animal models of locomotion have allowed a better understanding of the basic physiological mechanisms of gait. However, unlike most of the mammals, the Order Primates is characterized by fundamental changes in locomotor behaviour. In particular, some primates use a specific pattern of locomotion and are able to naturally walk bipedally due possibly to a specific supra-spinal control of locomotion. These features must be taken into account when one considers to study the intrinsic properties of human gait. Thus, an experimental model of bipedal locomotion allowing precise and reproducible analysis of gait in non-human primate is still lacking. This study describes a non-human primate model of bipedal locomotion under restrained condition. We undertook a kinematic and biomechanic study in three Macaca fascicularis trained to walk bipedally on a treadmill. One of the primate was evaluated in complete head fixation. Gait visual analysis and electromyographic recordings provided pertinent description of the gait pattern. Step frequencies, step lengths, cycle and stance phase durations were correlated with Froude number (dimensionless velocity), whereas swing phase durations remained non-correlated. Gait patterns observed in our model were similar to those obtained in freely bipedal Macaca fuscata and to a lesser extend to Humans. Gait pattern was not modified by head fixation thereby allowing us to perform precise and repetitive micro electrode recordings of deep cerebral structures. Thus, the present model could provide a pertinent pre-clinical tool to study gait parameters and their neuronal control but also could be helpful to validate new therapeutics interventions.","Goetz, L; Piallat, B; Thibaudier, Y; Montigon, O; David, O; Chabardès, S",Journal of neuroscience methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2011.11.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22155386/,427

We reviewed research on health promotion interventions and policies to address excessive drinking and to guide health-care reform. METHODS We searched Chinese- and English-language databases and included 21 studies in China published between 1980 and 2013 that covered each policy area from the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Strategy to Reduce the Harmful Use of Alcohol. We evaluated and compared preventive interventions to the global alcohol literature for cross-national applicability. RESULTS In contrast with hundreds of studies in the global literature, 11 of 12 studies from mainland China were published in Chinese; six of 10 in English were on taxation from Taiwan or Hong Kong. Most studies demonstrated effectiveness in reducing excessive drinking, and some reported the reduction of health problems. Seven were randomized controlled trials. Studies targeted schools, drink-driving, work-places, the health sector and taxation. CONCLUSIONS China is the world's largest alcohol market, yet there has been little growth in alcohol policy research related to health promotion interventions over the past decade. Guided by a public health approach, the WHO Global Strategy and health reform experience in Russia, Australia, Mexico and the United States, China could improve its public health response through better coordination and implementation of surveillance and evidence-based research, and through programmatic and legal responses such as public health law research, screening and early intervention within health systems and the implementation of effective alcohol control strategies.","Li, Qing; Babor, Thomas F; Zeigler, Donald; Xuan, Ziming; Morisky, Donald; Hovell, Melbourne F; Nelson, Toben F; Shen, Weixing; Li, Bing",Addiction,https://doi.org/10.1111/add.12784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25533866/,427

110566,"Zing-Yang Kuo and ""Giving up instincts in psychology"", 100 years later.",2021-05-01,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an invasive breast cancer with the characteristics of easy to develop distant metastasis. Immune escape is one of the main reasons for TNBC growth and metastasis. Enhancement of T cell-mediated anti-tumor activity may benefit to inhibit tumor metastasis and improve the efficacy of cancer therapy. As a natural bioactive substance, resveratrol shows potential capability to prevent or suppress the development of a variety of cancers through direct or indirect effects, including immunoregulatory effect. However, whether resveratrol might affect lung metastasis of TNBC, and whether the effect of resveratrol might be associated with resveratrol-regulated immune responses in tumor microenvironment is still unknown. In this study, by using an experimental metastatic mouse 4 T1 tumor model, we identified that resveratrol may suppress TNBC lung metastasis by elevating local anti-tumor immunity. Indeed, an increase in the cytotoxic activity of CD8+T cells as well as the levels of type 1 cytokine IFN-γ and IL-2 in the lungs of resveratrol-treated tumor bearing mice were observed. The enhanced CD8+T cell activity and Th1 immune responses by resveratrol administration might be related to the down-regulated PD-1 expression on pulmonary CD8+T cells and CD4+T cells. Resveratrol may also convert macrophages to M1 phenotype in the lungs of tumor bearing mice. However, it seems likely resveratrol has no effect on pulmonary myeloid-derived suppressor cell activation. Our results provide an evidence that resveratrol might be a promising candidate agent for adjuvant therapy in the process of TNBC metastasis.","Han, Xu; Zhao, Na; Zhu, Wenwen; Wang, Jia; Liu, Beixing; Teng, Yuee",Cellular immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2021.104423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399171/,427

METHODS We conducted a multi-center, retrospective, observational cohort study among all French expert centers for neuromyelitis optica and related disorders. Patients with NMOSD or MOGAD included in the study received a confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and June 30th , 2020. Main outcome was COVID-19 severity score assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 (not hospitalized with no limitations on activities) to 7 (death). RESULTS Fifteen cases (mean [SD] age: 39.3 [14.3] years, 11 female) were included. Five patients (33.3%) were hospitalized, all receiving rituximab. A 24-year-old patient with positive aquaporine-4 antibody, with obesity as comorbidity, needed mechanical ventilation. Outpatients were receiving anti-CD20 (5), mycophenolate mofetil (3) or azathioprine (3). They were younger (mean [SD] age: 37.0 [13.4] years), with a longer disease duration (mean [SD]: 8.3 [6.3] years) and had a lower EDSS score (median [range] EDSS: 2.5 [0-4]) relative to patients requiring hospitalization (mean [SD] age: 44.0 [16.4] years, mean [SD] disease duration: 5.8 [5.5] years, median [range] EDSS: 4 [0-6.5]).

We present the first reported case of an intraprocedural direct CCF that developed immediately after flow diversion for treatment of a symptomatic paraclinoid right internal carotid artery aneurysm with a neck involving the cavernous segment. Endovascular treatment of such direct fistulas typically involves either transarterial obliteration of the fistulous site or transvenous embolization of the cavernous sinus. Our case was successfully treated with further immediate flow diversion without additional transvenous intervention. There are few reports on the use of flow diversion for treatment of such direct CCFs, and in all but one of these cases, flow diversion was combined with concomitant transvenous embolization. Thus, the presented case is not only the first reported case of an immediate CCF after flow diversion, but it is also only the second reported case of a direct fistula to be successfully treated using solely flow diversion, without additional transvenous intervention.

OBJECTIVES The authors analyzed the incidence of bleeding and ischemic events occurring before angiography and assessed their association with antithrombotic drugs and mortality risk. METHODS All patients from the ACUITY (Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy) trial with planned angiography after enrollment were included. Bleeding events were classified according to the ACUITY scale as major or nonmajor bleeding. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed. RESULTS Of 13,726 patients, 275 (2.0%) bled before angiography, including 52 (0.4%) with major bleeding. Forty-four (0.3%) experienced myocardial infarction. The median time from randomization to coronary angiography was 4.5 h (interquartile ratio [IQR]: 1.7 to 19.7 h) for patients who did not bleed while waiting for angiography and 27.9 h (IQR: 21.9 to 65.6 h) for patients who bled while waiting for angiography (p < 0.001). Bleeding events accrued linearly over time, reaching 10.4% at 96 h post-randomization. Independent predictors of bleeding before angiography included age (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.03 per year of age; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01 to 1.04; p < 0.001), renal insufficiency (adjusted HR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.07 to 2.04; p = 0.02), and use of multiple antithrombotic drugs (adjusted HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.56; p < 0.001). Bleeding before coronary angiography was associated with longer hospitalization (4.8 days [IQR: 3.0 to 8.9 days] vs. 3.0 days [IQR: 1.9 to 5.9 days]; p < 0.001). Patients who bled before angiography were more likely to die within 1 year than patients who did not bleed (8.5% vs. 4.1%; p < 0.001; adjusted HR: 1.89 (95% CI: 1.23 to 2.90; p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS Upstream antithrombotic treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes awaiting coronary angiography is associated with excess bleeding with mortality implications. Bleeding avoidance strategies before angiogram, including early angiography, may negate the need to prolong upstream antithrombotic treatment and improve the overall risk-benefit balance for these patients.

We investigate, evaluate, and quantify such bias for these trials at our institution. METHODS Demographic, clinical, imaging, and angiographic data were prospectively collected on a consecutive cohort of patients with acute ischemic stroke who were enrolled in formal trials of endovascular stroke therapy (EST) or received EST in clinical practice outside of a randomized trial for acute cerebral ischemia at a single tertiary referral center from September 2004 to December 2012. RESULTS Among patients considered appropriate for EST in practice, 47% were eligible for trials, with rates for individual trials ranging from 17% to 70%. Compared with trial ineligible patients treated with EST, trial eligible patients were younger (67 vs. 74 years; p<0.05), more often treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (53% vs. 34%; p<0.01), and had shorter last known well to puncture times (328 vs. 367 min; p<0.05). Focusing on the largest trial with a non-interventional control arm, compared with trial eligible patients treated with EST outside the trial, enrolled patients presented later (274 vs. 163 min; p<0.001), had higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (20 vs. 17; p<0.05), and larger strokes (diffusion weighted imaging volumes 49 vs. 18; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The majority of patients felt suitable for EST at our institution were excluded from recent trials. Formal entry criteria succeeded in selecting patients with better prognostic features, although many of these patients were treated outside of trials.

The primary aim of this study was to identify risks for breastfeeding/pumping cessation with neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) infants' mothers who smoke or live with individuals who smoke, using a novel survival-analytic approach. METHODS/DESIGN Mothers (N = 360) were recruited for a secondhand smoke prevention intervention during infants' NICU hospitalizations and followed for ~6 months after infant discharge. Data were obtained from medical records and participant self-report/interviews. RESULTS The sample was predominantly ethnic/racial minorities; mean age was 26.8 (SD = 5.9) years. One-fifth never initiated breastfeeding/pumping (n = 67; 18.9%) and mean time-to-breastfeeding cessation was 48.1 days (SD = 57.2; median = 30.4 [interquartile range: 6.0-60.9]). Education, length of stay, employment, race/ethnicity, number of household members who smoke, and readiness-to-protect infants from tobacco smoke were significantly associated with breastfeeding cessation. Further, infants fed breast milk for ≥4 months had 42.7% more well-child visits (p < 0.001) and 50.0% fewer respiratory-related clinic visits (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION One-quarter of infants admitted to NICUs will be discharged to households where individuals who smoke live; we demonstrated that smoking-related factors were associated with mothers' breastfeeding practices.

In the porcine nephrectomy model, the operative times in the RoboHand group (28.8±6.6 min) were shorter than those in the LaparoAngle group (39.7±5.4 min), although not significant (P=0.146). The RoboHand prototype seems to be superior to other articulating laparoscopic instruments in its mechanical properties, such as joint force, and not to be clinically inferior to LaparoAngle for LESS. We describe the techniques for using this innovative instrument and discuss its advantages.","Jung, Jin-Woo; Cha, Woo Heon; Lee, Byung Ki; Lee, Sangchul; Lee, Seung Bae; Lee, Sang Eun; Jeong, Chang Wook",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2013.0510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24090367/,427
116832,Re: Are you coming to work during pandemic flu?,2009,"BACKGROUND AND AIM Endoscopic evaluation of disease activity, including mucosal healing, is poorly established in Crohn's disease. We previously reported that patients with a Lewis score (LS) on capsule endoscopy <270 had a lower risk of exacerbation without additional treatment. This study investigated prognostic predictors in patients undergoing capsule endoscopy and determined the optimal LS cut-off value. METHODS In a retrospective single-center study, 102 patients with Crohn's disease who underwent capsule endoscopy were reviewed. We reviewed the clinical course and the patients' characteristics, Crohn's Disease Activity Index, laboratory findings, LS, and Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) for factors potentially associated with Crohn's disease-related emergency hospitalization. Subsequently, we prospectively enrolled 66 patients with Crohn's disease and analyzed clinical outcomes according to these factors. RESULTS In the retrospective study, LS ≥270 and PNI <45 were identified as independent predictors of Crohn's disease-related emergency hospitalization with hazard ratios of 9.48 and 3.01, respectively. Even in patients with LS ≥270, cumulative hospitalization rates decreased after intervention based on capsule endoscopy findings. The prospective study confirmed that patients with LS ≥270 or PNI <45 had a significantly higher risk of Crohn's disease-related emergency hospitalization and that additional treatment reduced the risk of relapse. CONCLUSIONS LS and PNI are the best available prognostic predictors in patients with Crohn's disease without gastrointestinal stenosis and can guide decisions on treatment escalation. Patients with LS ≥270 and PNI <45 were at increased risk for exacerbation, and additional treatments should be considered for this group.","Nishikawa, Takahiro; Nakamura, Masanao; Yamamura, Takeshi; Maeda, Keiko; Sawada, Tsunaki; Mizutani, Yasuyuki; Ishikawa, Eri; Ishikawa, Takuya; Kakushima, Naomi; Furukawa, Kazuhiro; Ohno, Eizaburo; Honda, Takashi; Kawashima, Hiroki; Ishigami, Masatoshi; Fujishiro, Mitsuhiro",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.15366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33283324/,427

On the other hand, combined adult cases are uncommon. Here we report two adult cases of inguinal hernia combined with intra-canalicular cryptorchidism who underwent totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair with orchiectomy under the same operative view. PRESENTATION OF CASES We treated two patients (49- and 38-year-old men) with right indirect inguinal hernias and cryptorchidism. Both patients underwent TEP repair with orchiectomy. In operative findings, an atrophic testis was drawn out with a hernia sac from the internal inguinal ring. After the testis was separated from the sac and cord structure was sheared, it was removed. The procedure did not require special techniques and devices. In both patients, the postoperative courses were satisfactory. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, there has been only one such reported case till date which demonstrated the feasibility of TEP repair accompanied by orchiectomy. CONCLUSIONS TEP repair with orchiectomy under the same operative view could be safely performed in adults with an inguinal hernia combined with extra-abdominal cryptorchidism. This procedure could be an option for the treatment of such adult patients.","Fujishima, Hajime; Sasaki, Atsushi; Takeuchi, Yu; Morimoto, Akio; Inomata, Masafumi",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2015.10.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26581081/,427

Several companies have developed devices which fuse blood vessels, but little is known about the tissue's response to the stimuli. The need for accurate measurements of tissue behavior during tissue fusion is essential for the continued development and improvement of energy delivery devices. An experimental study was performed to measure the temperatures experienced during tissue fusion and the resulting burst pressure of the fused arteries. An array of thermocouples was placed in the lumen of a porcine splenic artery segment and sealed using a ConMed Altrus thermal fusion device. The temperatures within the tissue, in the device, and at the tissue-device interface were recorded. These measurements were then analyzed to calculate the temperature profile in the lumen of the artery. The temperature in the artery at the site of tissue fusion was measured to range from 142 to 163 °C using the ConMed Altrus. The corresponding burst pressure for arteries fused at this temperature was measured as 416 ± 79 mmHg. This study represents the first known experimental measurement of temperature at the site of vessel sealing found in the literature.","Cezo, James D; Kramer, Eric; Taylor, Kenneth D; Ferguson, Virginia; Rentschler, Mark E",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2013.2260542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23649130/,427

However, there is a paucity of data concerning the performance of this modality at ≥5 years. This study evaluated the long-term clinical and radiologic outcomes of primary stent therapy in patients with femoropopliteal arterial disease. METHODS A prospective data collection and analysis was conducted in patients undergoing primary stent placement in femoropopliteal lesions between September 2006 and September 2007. The EverFlex (Medtronic/Covidien, Plymouth, Minn) bare-metal stent was used. The primary outcome of this study was the primary patency rate. Secondary outcomes were secondary patency rate, amputation-free-survival (AFS), and freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR). A Cox regression analysis identified risk factors for the primary and the secondary measure outcomes. RESULTS Included were 89 patients (102 stents). The prevalence of critical limb ischemia was 34% (n = 30). The initial angiography revealed a TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease C/D lesion in 31 patients (35%). Occlusions were present in 49 patients (55%), and the mean lesion length was 116 ± 33 mm. Popliteal artery disease was present in 39 treated limbs (35%). The primary patency rate at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years was 73%, 64%, 47%, and 33% respectively. At 7 years, secondary patency rate was 67%, freedom from TLR was 47%, and the AFS was 73%. Cox regression analysis revealed a decreased AFS among diabetic patients (hazard ratio [HR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-6.28; P = .03), whereas secondary endovascular interventions showed a protective effect for AFS (HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.03-0.65; P = .01). Popliteal artery disease was identified as independent risk factor for secondary interventions (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.05-4.06; P = .04) and TLR (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.03-3.83; P = .04). Critical limb ischemia was associated with an increased incidence of surgical conversion owing to endovascular treatment failure (HR, 5.46; 95% CI, 2.44-12.17; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS This study found primary stenting was associated with acceptable clinical and radiologic long-term outcomes. Diabetes was associated with poor AFS, and popliteal artery involvement correlated with an increased need for reinterventions. AFS was better among patients undergoing secondary procedures.","Stavroulakis, Konstantinos; Torsello, Giovanni; Manal, Ayad; Schwindt, Arne; Hericks, Christiane; Stachmann, Arne; Schönefeld, Eva; Bisdas, Theodosios",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2016.05.073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27575816/,427

Methods: Coronavirus and heart failure were searched in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and omics data were selected to meet experimental requirements. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed using the Limma package in R language to screen for differentially expressed genes. The two sets of differential genes were introduced into the R language cluster Profiler package for gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto gene and genome encyclopedia (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Two sets of intersections were taken. A protein interaction network was constructed for all differentially expressed genes using STRING database and core genes were screened. Finally, the apparently accurate treatment prediction platform (EpiMed) independently developed by the team was used to predict the therapeutic drug. Results: The GSE59185 coronavirus data set was searched and screened in the GEO database, and divided into wt group, ΔE group, Δ3 group, Δ5 group according to different subtypes, and compared with control group. After the difference analysis, 191 up-regulated genes and 18 down-regulated genes were defined. The GEO126062 heart failure data set was retrieved and screened from the GEO database. A total of 495 differentially expressed genes were screened, of which 165 were up-regulated and 330 were down-regulated. Correlation analysis of differentially expressed genes between coronavirus and heart failure was performed. After cross processing, there were 20 GO entries, which were mainly enriched in virus response, virus defense response, type Ⅰ interferon response, γ interferon regulation, innate immune response regulation, negative regulation of virus life cycle, replication regulation of viral genome, etc . There are 5 KEGG pathways, mainly interacting with tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, cytokine and receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, human giant cells viral infection related. All differentially expressed genes were introduced into the SREING online analysis website for protein interaction network analysis, and core genes such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, IL-10, IL17, TNF, interferon regulatory factor 9, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 3, radical s-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2, c-x-c motif chemokine ligand 10, caspase 3 and other genes were screened. The drugs predicted by EpiMed's apparent precision treatment prediction platform for disease-drug association analysis are mainly TNF-α inhibitors, resveratrol, ritonavir, paeony, retinoic acid, forsythia, and houttuynia cordata. Conclusions: The abnormal activation of multiple inflammatory pathways may be the cause of heart failure in patients after coronavirus infection. Resveratrol, ritonavir, retinoic acid, amaranth, forsythia, houttuynia may have therapeutic effects. Future basic and clinical research is warranted to validate present results and hypothesis.","Chen, X M; Cao, F; Zhang, H M; Chen, H R; Zhang, J D; Zhi, P; Li, Z Y; Wang, Y X; Lu, X C",Zhonghua xin xue guan bing za zhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112148-20200308-00172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32228827/,427

Their definition of PHC was comprehensive, extending beyond medical care to include social determinants of health and public policy. However, they limited their operational definition for purposes of the study to general practice, community health and allied health. Applying a narrower definition risks lost opportunities to identify policy implications for equity beyond financial accessibility. The populations most at risk of non-communicable diseases also face significant language, culture, and individual and systemic discrimination barriers to access.

122577,Communication during crisis.,2020-07-13,"Mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59), is a coronavirus that triggers in susceptible mice a wide variety of pathologies, including hepatitis, thymus involution, B lymphocyte polyclonal activation and, after intra-cerebral inoculation, transient demyelination. One receptor that mediates entry of the virus into target cells has been identified: it is a glycoprotein of the carcinoembryonic antigen family, called Bgp1a. The availability of antibodies recognizing this molecule permits the analysis of its cellular expression and of the relationship between receptor expression and pathology induced by the virus. Bgp1a is found on epithelial and endothelial cells as well as on B lymphocytes and macrophages. In the liver, Bgp1a expression correlates well with infection of hepatocytes and endothelial cells, leading to the development of hepatitis. However, other cells expressing this molecule, such as central nervous system endothelial cells, are not infected by the virus. This observation may explain how the blood-brain barrier prevents dissemination of MHV-A59 from the general circulation into the brain. Thymic atrophy results from apoptosis of immature double-positive T lymphocytes which might be caused indirectly by infection of a small proportion of thymus epithelial cells that express Bgp1a rather than by infection of T cells that do not express the receptor. Finally, polyclonal activation of B lymphocytes, leading to increased secretion of antibodies of the IgG2a isotype, involves a cascade of events, including cytokine secretion, that may result from the interaction of MHV-A59 with B cells and macrophages that express Bgp1a. Therefore, after viral infection, cellular expression of Bgp1a may have different results: cell lysis; alteration of cellular functions that may lead to indirect death of other cell types, or resistance to infection.","Godfraind, C; Coutelier, J P",Histology and histopathology,https://doi.org/10.14670/hh-13.181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9476648/,427

Methods The medical records of 50 patients who underwent elective surgery for Crohn's disease were reviewed retrospectively. Propofol and remifentanil were administered using target effect-site concentration (Ce)-controlled infusion with the modified Marsh and Minto models. Target Ce values of propofol were adjusted within a range of 2.5-3 µg/ml to maintain a bispectral index (BIS) value of less than 60 during anesthesia maintenance. Dosages of anesthetic agents administered during surgery were compared between underweight and normal-weight patients. The infusion profiles of patients were applied as inputs to calculate the Ce values in the Schnider model. Results The total midazolam and remifentanil dosages required for underweight patients were higher than those required for normal-weight patients to maintain BIS values at less than 60 within a target propofol Ce range of 2.5-3 µg/ml. Simulation results suggested that the Schnider model may be an appropriate pharmacokinetic model for target-controlled infusion in underweight patients, as the clearance was consistently higher in the Schnider model than the modified Marsh model, particularly in underweight patients. Conclusions The modified Marsh model might cause inadvertent propofol underdosing in underweight patients. Future studies are necessary to compare the predictive performance of the modified Marsh and Schnider pharmacokinetic models in underweight patients.","Park, Soo-Kyung; Park, Ji Hyun; Kang, Hyun Uk; Choi, Byung-Moon; Noh, Gyu-Jeong",Korean journal of anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.4097/kjae.2017.70.6.606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29225743/,427
124876,Covid-19: UK government is urged to publish daily care home deaths as it promises more testing.,2020-04-15,"BACKGROUND Although AKI lacks effective therapeutic approaches, preventive strategies using preconditioning protocols, including caloric restriction and hypoxic preconditioning, have been shown to prevent injury in animal models. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the enhanced resistance to AKI conferred by such approaches is needed to facilitate clinical use. We hypothesized that these preconditioning strategies use similar pathways to augment cellular stress resistance. METHODS To identify genes and pathways shared by caloric restriction and hypoxic preconditioning, we used RNA-sequencing transcriptome profiling to compare the transcriptional response with both modes of preconditioning in mice before and after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. RESULTS The gene expression signatures induced by both preconditioning strategies involve distinct common genes and pathways that overlap significantly with the transcriptional changes observed after ischemia-reperfusion injury. These changes primarily affect oxidation-reduction processes and have a major effect on mitochondrial processes. We found that 16 of the genes differentially regulated by both modes of preconditioning were strongly correlated with clinical outcome; most of these genes had not previously been directly linked to AKI. CONCLUSIONS This comparative analysis of the gene expression signatures in preconditioning strategies shows overlapping patterns in caloric restriction and hypoxic preconditioning, pointing toward common molecular mechanisms. Our analysis identified a limited set of target genes not previously known to be associated with AKI; further study of their potential to provide the basis for novel preventive strategies is warranted.

Because most cases of mucormycosis are associated with contiguous rhinocerebral infection, only 5 cases of isolated musculoskeletal Rhizopus infection have been reported in the literature. One patient underwent hematopoietic cell transplant, which resulted in a fatal outcome.This article describes the successful treatment of isolated Rhizopus osteomyelitis in a patient who underwent hematopoietic cell transplant using a combined surgical and medical approach. A 33-year-old woman with pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia underwent hematopoietic cell transplant with few complications but developed chronic graft-versus-host disease 8 months posttransplant. She was treated with high-dose steroids for 6 weeks before she was admitted for severe right tibial pain in the absence of trauma. Early detection, aggressive therapies, and a multidisciplinary surgical and medical team allowed for the microbiologically confirmed resolution of the infection. Treatment included multiagent antimicrobial therapy with amphotericin B, daptomycin, and ertapenem. Several surgical irrigation and debridement procedures were also performed, with the eventual placement of amphotericin-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate cement beads and small fragment titanium screws.

METHODS AND RESULTS This single-centre real-world registry included 93 patients who underwent renal denervation employing the Symplicity system. Patients were followed for six months. The patient cohort was divided into early responders with a reduction of office systolic blood pressure >10 mmHg three months after the procedure (n=53, 57%), late responders (six months after the procedure, n=16, 17%) and non-responders (n=24, 26%). After six months, systolic blood pressure was lowered by 46±2.9 mmHg (mean±SEM, p<0.001), 31±3.4 mmHg (p<0.001) and 7.1±3.3 mmHg (p=0.79, ns), respectively. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring also showed a significant reduction in the early responder group (20±5.7 mmHg, p=0.002). We subjected eight patients to a re-do procedure which led to a significant reduction of blood pressure in another five patients after six months (63%). One patient in this cohort developed a one-sided renal artery stenosis associated with an increase in blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS This real-world analysis of renal sympathetic denervation confirms the procedure to be safe and efficient in the majority of patients. Non-responders may profit from a second ablation, arguing in favour of the hypothesis that the procedure did not destroy sufficient amounts of sympathetic innervation in these patients.

Uveitis patients require particular attention because of their theoretical risk of viral infection, in the context of therapeutic immunosuppression. AREAS COVERED This collaborative work proposes practical management and follow-up criteria for uveitis patients in the context of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. EXPERT OPINION Management should proceed as usual when access to healthcare is possible in patients who do not belong to a group at high risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection; and in uncontrolled uveitis cases. In case of reduced access to eye clinics or high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients' management should be stratified based on their clinical presentation. In non-severe uveitis cases, the use of systemic steroids should be avoided, and local steroids preferred whenever possible. In uncontrolled situations where there is real risk of permanent visual loss, high-dose intravenous steroids and/or systemic immunosuppressants and/or biotherapies can be administered depending on the severity of eye disease.

However, in gynecology as well as in other surgical specialties, preliminary results seem to be controversial. Its feasibility and interest by comparison with conventional laparoscopy (CL) have not been confirmed by randomized multicenter studies. OBJECTIVES Compare in gynecological surgery, feasibility and surgical outcomes (conversion rate and complications, postoperative pain, duration of surgery, length of hospital stay, appearance and cost) between SILS and CL. PATIENTS AND METHODS For this, a review of the literature from a PUBMED and Medline databases was conducted. The clinical cases and series with fewer than 10 patients were excluded. Eligible data were compared and analyzed. RESULTS A total of 46 studies including five prospective randomized were studied in gynecology. Conversion rates and complications appear identical to those of the CL. The learning curve is also comparable. The technique is not standardized and some ergonomic problems are described. Operating time and duration of hospitalization seems to be comparable. The postoperative pain assessment found conflicting results. The cosmetic results are in favor of the single incision laparoscopy. Finally, the cost is higher. CONCLUSIONS According to the literature, the single incision laparoscopy seems feasible and safe, with better cosmetic results. But the cost is increased and associated with no benefit in terms of pain, operating time and duration of hospitalization. Beyond cosmetics results, further randomized studies are needed to identify a possible benefit.","Rabischong, B; Compan, C; Savary, D; Bourdel, N; Canis, M; Mage, G; Botchorishvili, R","Journal de gynecologie, obstetrique et biologie de la reproduction",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgyn.2013.03.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23764230/,427

Understanding how and when SARS-CoV-2 spreads is critical to the development of effective infection prevention within clinical practices. Method We established an evidence-based clinical practice guide for clinicians working with voice and upper airway through a comprehensive evaluation of peer-reviewed journals, non-peer-reviewed manuscripts on preprint servers, national health guidelines, and published and online consensus statements and emerging data. Emphasis was placed on risk mitigation for viral transmission via safe clinical practices, including evaluative procedures, therapy including telehealth, personal protective equipment, room, staffing, and distancing considerations. Results/Conclusions While knowledge relevant to viral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly evolving, there is a paucity of literature specific to the evaluation and treatment of voice and upper airway disorders. Within these confines and given the potentially significant high risk of infection secondary to the nature of COVID-19, we summarize current considerations and recommend best practices that maximize risk mitigation whereby ensuring patient and provider safety.","Doll, Emerald J; Braden, Maia N; Thibeault, Susan L",American journal of speech-language pathology,https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_ajslp-20-00228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33332145/,427
131875,Quickest Detection of COVID-19 Pandemic Onset.,2021,"OBJECTIVE This study examined cognitive, affective, and medical impairments and their impact on rehabilitation approaches for improving functional outcome after hospitalization in older adults. DESIGN A secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial in 229 adults 65 yrs or older admitted to two skilled nursing facilities undergoing rehabilitation services was conducted. Patients were randomized to receive physical and occupational therapy by therapists trained in systematic approaches to engage patients, called Enhanced Medical Rehabilitation, or standard of care. The outcome of interest was functional improvement, defined as Barthel Index at discharge (controlling for Barthel Index upon admission). This study analyzed the relationship of measures of cognition, depression, and medical comorbidities as predictors of functional outcome and as moderators interacting with treatment group. RESULTS Clock drawing score moderated treatment effect size; the functional improvement of Enhanced Medical Rehabilitation over standard of care therapy reduced with increasing executive impairment. In contrast, general cognitive abilities, depression, medical comorbidities, and readiness for rehabilitation were neither predictors nor moderators of functional improvement. CONCLUSIONS For older adults undergoing rehabilitation, greater functional improvement with the motivational techniques of Enhanced Medical Rehabilitation was contingent on patients having intact executive function. Given that executive function impairments are common in rehabilitation populations, new strategies are needed to improve treatment outcomes in physical/occupational therapy.

132852,Access to firearms and adolescent suicide.,2020-07-22,"A coronavirus (CoV) previously shown to be associated with catarrhal gastroenteritis in mink (Mustela vison) was identified by electron microscopy in mink faeces from two fur farms in Wisconsin and Minnesota in 1998. A pan-coronavirus and a genus-specific RT-PCR assay were used initially to demonstrate that the newly discovered mink CoVs (MCoVs) were members of the genus Alphacoronavirus. Subsequently, using a random RT-PCR approach, full-genomic sequences were generated that further confirmed that, phylogenetically, the MCoVs belonged to the genus Alphacoronavirus, with closest relatedness to the recently identified but only partially sequenced (fragments of the polymerase, and full-length spike, 3c, envelope, nucleoprotein, membrane, 3x and 7b genes) ferret enteric coronavirus (FRECV) and ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV). The molecular data presented in this study provide the first genetic evidence for a new coronavirus associated with epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis outbreaks in mink and demonstrate that MCoVs possess high genomic variability and relatively low overall nucleotide sequence identities (91.7 %) between contemporary strains. Additionally, the new MCoVs appeared to be phylogenetically distant from human (229E and NL63) and other alphacoronaviruses and did not belong to the species Alphacoronavirus 1. It is proposed that, together with the partially sequenced FRECV and FRSCV, they comprise a new species within the genus Alphacoronavirus.","Vlasova, Anastasia N; Halpin, Rebecca; Wang, Shiliang; Ghedin, Elodie; Spiro, David J; Saif, Linda J",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.025353-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21346029/,427

Application of a recognized value framework to published studies could objectively compare the potential benefit across available therapies. MATERIALS AND METHODS An umbrella review of phase III trials for HCC therapies was performed. ASCO Value Framework Net Health Benefit Score version 2 (ASCO-NHB v2) scores, the primary analysis, and European Society of Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale version 1.1 scores, the secondary analysis, were computed using selected drug registration trials. Both scores were compared between drugs that were Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved by 2020 and those that were not. RESULTS Of the 22 studies identified, nine were FDA-approved and 13 were not. Across 22 trials, the median overall survival (OS) was 9.2 months (range, 1.9-16.4 months), with a median gain of 0.35 month (range, 2.3-3.3 months). HCC therapies that were FDA-approved showed longer OS (median 10.7 v 7.9 months, P < .01) and higher ASCO NHB scores (+18.4 v -5.7 scores, P < .01). The median gain in OS was 2.2 months in the approved treatments compared with -0.3 months in the unapproved group, with no difference in progression-free survival between the two groups. CONCLUSION The nine FDA-approved therapies for HCC have higher mean NHB score than those that were not FDA-approved. The application of ASCO-NHB v2 and other proposed value frameworks could examine data of future therapies for HCC through a patient-oriented approach.","Chen, Emerson Y; Cook, Madeline; Deig, Christopher; Arastu, Asad; Prasad, Vinay; Nabavizadeh, Nima; Lopez, Charles D; Kardosh, Adel",JCO oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/op.20.00558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411593/,427

Nonadherence to treatment is related to several factors and may lead to persistence of symptoms and relapse. Worldwide, the rate of nonadherence to treatment in individuals with schizophrenia is around 50%. OBJECTIVES To compare the clinical profile of nonadherent and adherent patients among individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia receiving treatment at psychosocial care centers in a city in southern Brazil. METHOD The clinical-epidemiological profile of patients with schizophrenia was retrospectively analyzed based on medical records entered into the system between January and December 2016, evaluating data at one-year follow-up. RESULTS 112 patients were included. The disease was more prevalent in men; mean age was 40.5 years, being lower among men. Most of the sample had a low level of education, was unemployed/retired, did not have children and resided with relatives. The highest rate of diagnosis was among young adults. Psychotic symptoms were most frequently described, and the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic was haloperidol. The nonadherence rate was 15.2%; only one patient required admission to a psychiatric hospital. Among nonadherent patients, the mean time of attendance was 6 months; there were more nonadherent women than men. The most prevalent age range of nonadherence was 41-64 years. Psychosocial and clinical data were similar across the whole sample. CONCLUSION A nonadherence rate of 15.2% was found among individuals receiving treatment for schizophrenia, suggesting that psychosocial care centers were effective in treating and monitoring these patients.","Viveiros, Camila Poletto; Tatar, Camila Rodrigues; Dos Santos, Deivisson Vianna Dantas; Stefanello, Sabrina; Nisihara, Renato",Trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1590/2237-6089-2019-0072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084799/,427

134799,Fallout of Lead Over Paris From the 2019 Notre-Dame Cathedral Fire.,2020-08-01,"OBJECTIVES To identify the adherence interventions used with people receiving treatments to prevent or manage scarring, the effectiveness of these interventions, and the theoretical frameworks on which these interventions were based. DATA SOURCES Databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsychINFO and OTseeker) were searched (09.10.2020) with no date or language restrictions. Grey literature databases, clinical trial registries and references lists of key papers were also searched. REVIEW METHODS Eligible randomised controlled trials included people using treatments for scarring following skin wounds, interventions that may improve adherence, and outcomes measuring adherence. Risk of bias (selection, performance, detection, attrition, reporting) and certainty of evidence (inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, publication bias) were assessed. RESULTS Four randomised trials were included with 224 participants (17 children) with burn scars. Interventions involved educational (three trials) or technology-based components (four trials) and ranged in length from two weeks to six months. All four trials reported greater adherence rates in the intervention group compared with standard practice [standardised mean difference = 1.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.91-2.08); 2.01 (95% CI 1.05-2.98); odds ratio = 0.28 (95% CI = 0.11-0.69)]. One trial did not report original data. The certainty of evidence was very low. CONCLUSION Adherence interventions using education or technology for people receiving burn scar treatment may improve adherence. Further studies are needed particularly in children, with a focus on including outcomes of importance to patients (e.g. quality of life) and identifying core components of effective adherence interventions using theoretical frameworks.","Killey, Jessica; Simons, Megan; Tyack, Zephanie",Clinical rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1177/0269215520978528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305622/,427

135631,Ticking the ICE box: the future of doctor-patient communication in a post-covid world.,2021-04-23,"BACKGROUND Liver fibrosis is a chronic pathological condition with a leading cause of liver-related mortality worldwide. In the present study, we have evaluated the antifibrotic effect of crocin, a carotenoid present in the stigma of Crocus sativus, and also explored its putative mechanism of action. METHODS Liver fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal administration of 30% carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). The crocin was administered orally at 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg body weight along with CCl4 up to 8 weeks. RESULTS Chronic exposure to CCl4 resulted in elevated levels of liver enzymes and reduced cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) activity in the liver. The liver tissue showed cellular swelling, vacuolization, necrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells and fibrotic changes. The crocin treatment significantly lowered the levels of liver enzymes in serum and improved the liver CYP2E1 mRNA levels. The pathological changes in the liver were also lowered by crocin treatment. The level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor-kappa B, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α and fibrogenic factor, transforming growth factor β, and α-smooth muscle actin were elevated by the CCl4 in the liver tissue. However, crocin treatment at different doses significantly reduced the expression of these factors. The increased caspase 3/7 activity was also lowered by crocin. CCl4 administration decreased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) in liver tissue. The improved PPAR-γ expression in the liver by crocin treatment indicates its role in the therapeutic effect of crocin. CONCLUSIONS Crocin attenuated the various events in the progression of liver fibrosis via PPAR-γ mediated modulation of inflammatory and fibrogenic pathways.","Chhimwal, J; Sharma, S; Kulurkar, P; Patial, V",Human & experimental toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0960327120937048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633567/,427

There is also a critical need to develop interventions to prevent the complications of COVID-19, which occur with an alarming frequency in older adults. Since severe pathologic effects of infection occur with increasing age, COVID-19 falls under the geroscience concept that all diseases in older adults have a common and major underlying cause of declining function and resilience. Geroscience posits that manipulation of aging will simultaneously delay the appearance or severity of major diseases because they share the same risk factor: aging and the multiple processes involved in aging. Drug combinations that target multiple aging processes and the cytokine networks associated with them would not necessarily limit SARS-CoV-2 infection rates but would prevent severe pathologic consequences of the disease in older adults by maintaining a more youthful-like resilience to infection-related complications. A drug cocktail aimed at controlling cytokine actions would complement current clinical treatments and vaccine effectiveness for COVID-19 and serve as a prototype for future age-related infectious disease pandemics wherein the elderly population is especially vulnerable.","Dou, Yan; Fatemi, Soroosh; Darvas, Martin; Gale, Michael; Ladiges, Warren",Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,https://doi.org/10.1089/jir.2020.29018.dou; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32790488/,427

This prospective, randomized study was undertaken to evaluate epidural anesthesia for patients undergoing LESS cholecystectomy, to assess the feasibility, and to analyze all intraoperative and postoperative complications. The secondary objectives were to determine differences in postoperative pain and time until PACU discharge-to-home readiness between patients. METHODS With institutional review board approval, 20 patients with chronic cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and/or biliary dyskinesia were randomized to receive spinal epidural anesthesia (n = 10) or general anesthesia (n = 10). Postoperative pain at rest was recorded in the PACU every 10 min, and at rest and walking at discharge using the visual analog scale (VAS). Operative time and time until PACU discharge-to-home readiness were recorded. Results are expressed as mean ± SD. RESULTS Patient age, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, and body mass index were similar. There were no additional ports/incisions, conversions to ""open"" operations, or conversions to general anesthesia. There were no differences in operative duration. Time until postanesthesia care unit discharge-to-home ready was not significantly different. The most common postoperative adverse event was urinary retention (1 epidural and 3 general anesthesia patients). Resting postoperative VAS pain score at discharge was 4.7 ± 2.5 vs. 2.2 ± 1.6 (p = 0.02, general versus epidural anesthesia respectively); the stressed VAS pain score at discharge was 6.1 ± 2.3 vs. 3.1 ± 2.8 (p = 0.02, general versus epidural anesthesia respectively). CONCLUSIONS LESS cholecystectomy with epidural anesthesia was completed with no operative or anesthetic conversions, and less postoperative pain at discharge. Epidural anesthesia appears to be a preferable alternative to general anesthesia for patients undergoing LESS cholecystectomy.","Ross, Sharona B; Mangar, Devanand; Karlnoski, Rachel; Camporesi, Enrico; Downes, Katheryne; Luberice, Kenneth; Haines, Krista; Rosemurgy, Alexander S",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2667-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23242490/,427
138791,CONTROLS TO MINIMIZE DISRUPTION OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLY CHAIN DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.,2020-05-28,"INTRODUCTION Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is a commonly encountered peripheral vestibular disorder. People exposed to massive earthquakes experience intense and long-term problem associated with dizziness. The purpose of our study is to investigate this relationship and to demonstrate the efficacy of the treatment modalities used in the management of patients with post-earthquake dizziness. METHODOLOGY The study was carried out by examining the retrospective records of patients who presented with dizziness to the otorhinolaryngological outpatient unit before and after the Elazig earthquake that occurred on 24th Jan 2020. Parameters evaluated include patients' age and gender, onset of dizziness, accompanying symptoms and comorbidities, videonystagmography (VNG) findings, pre- and post-treatment Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS The number of patients who presented with dizziness to our outpatient clinic after the earthquake and were included in our study totaled 84. The number of patients who visited the outpatient clinic before the earthquake was identified to be 75. In the earthquake related group, while there was a statistically significant difference between residual symptoms (RS) and the need for repetitive repositioning maneuvers, there was no statistically significant difference detected for age, gender, and comorbidities. Also, no statistically significant difference was found in the pre- and post-treatment assessments of VAS, DHI, and HADS median values in the earthquake group. CONCLUSION There was a remarkable increase in the number of patients presenting with dizziness in the early post-earthquake period. Management of these patients may differ from the classic BPPV. Residual symptoms appearing after performing repositioning maneuvers can be more commonly seen among these patients.","Yildiz, Muhammed Gazi; Bilal, Nagihan; Kara, Irfan; Sagiroglu, Saime; Orhan, Israfil; Doganer, Adem","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",https://doi.org/10.1177/0003489421996914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33715462/,427
139926,A nurse staffing model for an unprecedented event.,2021-03-01,"PURPOSE Reports have been issued recently on single incision laparoscopic hernioplasty, but no large-scale study has been conducted as yet. This study aimed to assess the safety and feasibility of the single incision laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal hernioplasty (SIL-TEP) on a large number of cases. METHODS 512 SIL-TEPs in 471 patients were performed from June 2010 to January 2014 at Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea. SIL-TEP was performed using a glove single port device and standard laparoscopic instruments. Short-term outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Of the 512 hernias, 329 (64.3 %) were indirect, 144 (28.1 %) were direct, 9 (1.8 %) were femoral, and 30 (5.9 %) were combined. There were 3 (0.6 %) conversions to single or three-port laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernioplasty. Mean operative time was 41.6 min for unilateral hernias and 65.3 min for bilateral hernias. Postoperative complications occurred in 45 cases (9.6 %); 21 were wound seromas, 5 were hematomas, and 18 were urinary retentions. All were successfully treated conservatively. Mean hospital stay was 1.8 days. CONCLUSION The SIL-TEP is safe and technically feasible.

141989,"Endovascular removal of a permanent ""TrapEase"" inferior vena cava filter.",2013,"BACKGROUND Low-velocity motor vehicle crashes often lead to severe and chronic neck disorders also referred to as whiplash-associated disorders (WAD). The etiology of WAD is still not fully understood. Many studies using a real or simulated collision scenario have focused on rear-end collisions, whereas the kinematics and muscular responses during frontal-oblique collisions have hardly been investigated. In particular for rear-end collisions, drivers were shown to have a higher WAD risk than front seat passengers. Yet, independently from the impact direction, neither the muscular nor the kinematic responses of drivers and front seat passengers have been compared to date, although some findings indicate that the neck muscles have the potential to alter the head and neck kinematics, and that the level of neck muscle activity during impact may be relevant for the emergence of WAD. OBJECTIVE In this study, we quantitatively examined the subjects' neck muscle activity during low-velocity left-frontal-oblique impacts to gain further insights into the neuromuscular mechanism underlying whiplash-like perturbations that may lead to WAD. METHODS In a within-subject study design, we varied several impact parameters to investigate their effect on neck muscle response amplitude and delay. Fifty-two subjects experienced at least ten collisions while controlling for the following parameters: change in velocity Δv (3 / 6 km/h), seating position (driver / front seat passenger), and deliberate pre-tension of the musculature (tense / relaxed) to account for a potential difference between an expected and an unexpected crash. Ten of the 52 subjects additionally ran the same experimental conditions as above, but without wearing a safety belt. FINDINGS There were significant main effects of Δv and muscle pre-tension on the reflex amplitude but not of seating position. As for the reflex delay, there was a significant main effect of muscle pre-tension, but neither of Δv nor of seating position. Moreover, neither the safety belt nor its asymmetrical orientation had an influence on the reflexive responses of the occupants. CONCLUSION In summary, we did not find any significant differences in the reflex amplitude and delay of the neck musculature between drivers and front seat passengers. We therefore concluded that an increased risk of the driver sustaining WAD in frontal-oblique collisions, if it exists, cannot be due to differences in the reflexive responses.","Mühlbeier, Andreas; Boström, Kim Joris; Kalthoff, Wolfram; de Lussanet, Marc H E; Kraaijenbrink, Cassandra; Hagenfeld, Lena; Castro, William H M; Wagner, Heiko",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30596721/,427

However, the uptake rate of genetic testing services for breast cancer risk remains low in many countries. Interventions targeting the uptake of these services among individuals potentially at risk for inherited breast cancer are often complex and have multiple components, and are therefore difficult to implement, replicate and disseminate to new contexts. Our aim is to systematically review studies targeting the uptake of genetic testing services for breast cancer risk and critically assess the quality of implementation outcomes and the reporting of intervention descriptions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Library and all Campbell Coordinating Group databases will be searched for intervention studies that target individuals' participation in breast cancer genetic testing programmes. Papers published in English within the time period from January 2005 until October 2019 will be considered for inclusion. Titles, abstracts and full papers will be screened for eligibility by two pairs of reviewers independently. For data analysis and synthesis, study-level and intervention-level characteristics will be abstracted. We will present all implementation outcomes that are mentioned in each of the studies and register the number of studies that do not at all look at or report implementation outcomes. The quality of implementation will be checked using a 5-point rubric item, and the quality and completeness of reporting of intervention description will be evaluated using the 12-item Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required to conduct this review. Review findings will be disseminated to academic and non-specialist audiences via peer-reviewed academic journals and presented at appropriate conferences, workshops and meetings to policymakers, practitioners and organisations that work with our population of interest.

Due to a lack of existing vaccines or specific therapeutics, little other than supportive care and attempts to interrupt transmission can be provided during initial outbreaks. This has prompted a shift in vaccine design and development to identify novel epitopes and mechanisms of protection that may offer a broader range of protection against groups or whole families of viruses. Receptor-binding domains and other motifs within viral envelope proteins represent one excellent opportunity to target communal epitopes shared by related viruses. Similarly, for viruses where envelope participates in driving viral egress from infected cells, shared epitopes need to be identified to guide the development of broadly protective antibodies and vaccines. Here, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of broadly protective humoral responses for emerging viruses.","Jin, Jing; Simmons, Graham",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,https://doi.org/10.1128/cvi.00136-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27226280/,427

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of early upper gastrointestinal (UGI) contrast studies in the detection of postoperative complications. METHODS Radiographic reports were reviewed from April 2006 to January 2013. During that time, 161 patients underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. All patients were submitted to UGI examination on postoperative day (POD) 1. RESULTS Among the 161 patients who underwent UGI, no contrast leaks were found on POD 1. Three patients (1.9%) developed stapler line leaks near the gastroesophageal junction, which were diagnosed on PODs 3, 4, and 10. Gastroesophageal reflux in 5 patients (3.1%) and delayed gastroesophageal transit in 10 patients (6.2%) were detected. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study show that UGI series on POD 1 cannot assess the integrity of the gastric remnant. Early UGI series are not required as routine procedures in all operated patients. Computed tomographic swallow studies should be performed in patients who postoperatively develop clinical signs and symptoms of complications such as tachycardia, pain, or fever.","Mittermair, Reinhard; Sucher, Robert; Perathoner, Alexander; Wykypiel, Heinz",American journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2013.06.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24119721/,427
146783,Advancing the health of homeless populations through vaccinations.,2020-10-07,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) has not gained widespread acceptance because of technical difficulties, especially esophagojejunal anastomosis. Various modified procedures for reconstruction have been reported, but an optimal method has not been established. The authors report a circular-stapled anastomosis using hand-sewn purse-string sutures, which is a simple and classic method. However, no previous study has assessed its reliability. METHODS From September 2008 to May 2009, 10 consecutive patients (9 men and 1 woman) with gastric cancer underwent LTG at the authors' institution. These patients had a median age of 63.7 years (range, 45-80 years) and a body mass index of 22.4 kg/m(2) (range, 18-26 kg/m(2)). After transection of the abdominal esophagus, a hand-sewn purse-string suture along the cut end of the esophagus was performed using 3-0 monofilament thread. An anvil head then was inserted into the esophagus, and the thread was tied. A monofilament pretied loop suture was added to reinforce the ligation. After the creation of an Roux-en-Y jejunal limb, laparoscopic esophagojejunal anastomosis was performed using a circular stapler inserted via a surgical glove attached to a wound retractor at the incision point at the umbilicus. The jejunal stump was closed with an endoscopic linear stapler. RESULTS Laparoscopic esophagojejunostomy was performed successfully for all the patients. No postoperative complications related to anastomosis occurred. In one patient, an intraabdominal abscess developed postoperatively and was treated conservatively. The mean operation time was 257 min, and the estimated blood loss was 69 ml. CONCLUSIONS With the described method, esophagojejunostomy can be performed as in conventional open surgery. Hand-sewn purse-string suturing is demanding technically, but it can be performed safely by experienced laparoscopic surgeons. This technique is feasible and can lower the cost of the laparoscopic procedure. It may be considered in countries with limited access to other special devices.","Kinoshita, Takahiro; Oshiro, Takashi; Ito, Katsuhiko; Shibasaki, Hidehito; Okazumi, Shinichi; Katoh, Ryoji",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1041-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20383532/,427

The data on cases and deaths due to COVID-19 were drawn from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The data on age- and sex-wise cases, deaths and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and public health interventions in the Nordic region through November 10, 2020, were obtained from respective countries' health ministries. Sweden accounted for 60.59% of cases (162 240 of 267 768 cases) and 81% of deaths (6057 of 7477 cases) in the Nordic region. The incidence rate for the Nordic region was 989.59 per 100 000, varying from 327.30 per 100 000 in Finland to 1616.51 per 100 000 in Sweden, and the mortality rate for the region was 27.63 per 100 000, ranging from 5.3 per 100 000 in Norway to 60.35 per 100 000 in Sweden. The case-fatality ratio of the Nordic region was 2.79%. Females were more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than males (52.30% vs 47.66%), while males had a greater proportion of deaths (54.7%) and ICU need (71.99%) than females. It is imperative to continue with social distancing, mandatory masks, testing, prohibition of mass gatherings, isolation of confirmed cases, and preventing the importation of cases from other countries to avoid the further resurgence of cases.","Nanda, Mehak; Sharma, Rajesh","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",https://doi.org/10.1177/0020731421994840; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33656388/,427

Researchers of various fields are trying to put forth a noninvasive approach to forecast the disease-related genes. As diseased genes are more random than the healthy ones, in this work, a comparison of the diseased gene is made against the healthy ones. An adaptive signal processing method like functional link artificial neural network-based Levenberg-Marquardt filter has been proposed in this regard. For parameter upgradation, the algorithm is modified using particle swarm optimization. Here, disease genes are discriminated from healthy ones based on the magnitude of mean square error (MSE), which is calculated through the adaptive filter. The performance of the algorithm is inspected by computing some evaluation parameters. Since accuracy is the prime concern, authors in this work have taken an attempt to improve the accuracy level compared to the existing methods. Taking the reference gene as healthy, the overall process is accomplished by categorizing the diseased and healthy targets with MSE value at a threshold of 0.012. The proposed technique predicts the test gene sets successfully.","Das, Lopamudra; Nanda, Sarita; Das, J K","Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",https://doi.org/10.1080/15257770.2020.1780440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32571139/,427

Therefore, psychiatrists and GPs are key populations where it is crucial to examine stigma, improve attitudes and reduce discrimination towards psychiatric patients. AIMS This study is the first to explore mental health-related stigma among Portuguese psychiatrists and GPs, examining the differences between these two specialities and assessing whether sociodemographic and professional variables are associated with stigma. METHOD A cross-sectional study was performed between June 2018 and August 2019. A consecutive sample of 55 Psychiatrists and 67 GPs working in Porto (Portugal) filled a 25-item self-report questionnaire to assess their attitudes towards PDMDs in clinical practice. The instrument was designed by the authors, based on previous mental health-related stigma studies and validated scales. The questionnaire includes 12 stigma dimensions (Autonomy, Coercion, Incompetence, Dangerousness, Permanence, Pity, Responsibility, Segregation, Labelling, Diagnostic Overshadowing, Shame and Parental Incompetence), and its total score was used to measure Overall Stigma (OS). Sample characteristics were examined using descriptive statistics, and the factors affecting stigma were assessed through regression analysis. RESULTS GPs exhibit significantly higher OS levels than psychiatrists, and present higher scores in the dimensions of dangerousness, parental incompetence, diagnostic overshadowing and responsibility. Besides medical speciality, several other sociodemographic variables were associated with sigma, including age, gender, having a friend with a mental disorder, professional category, agreement that Psychiatry diverges from core medicine and physician's interest in mental health topics. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that both psychiatrists and GPs hold some degree of stigmatizing attitudes towards PDMDs. Overall, these results bring new light to stigma research, and provide information to tailor anti-stigma interventions to Portuguese psychiatrists and GPs.","Almeida, Bárbara; Samouco, Ana; Grilo, Filipe; Pimenta, Sónia; Moreira, Ana Maria",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640211002558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730898/,427

149872,Pivoting During a Pandemic.,2020-10-01,"Aims: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused strain on hospital systems and potential delay in diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Outpatient diagnosis and treatment of metabolically stable young persons with new-onset T1D have been shown to be equivalent to inpatient. We describe an approach to outpatient management of newly diagnosed T1D during the COVID-19 pandemic using an interdisciplinary team, telemedicine, and diabetes technologies including rapid implementation of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Methods: Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, new-onset cases of T1D were tracked. After laboratory confirmation of diagnosis and metabolic stability, patients and families were referred for ambulatory initiation of insulin therapy and diabetes education. These cases were reviewed using data extracted from the electronic health record, comments from multidisciplinary team members, and cloud-based glucose data. Results: We report on seven young people with new-onset T1D without diabetic ketoacidosis from April to June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ages ranged 9-23 years with presenting hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values 10-14.5%. Initial evaluation was generally face-to-face, followed by frequent telemedicine visits. Five patients had a family history of T1D. Two patients had access to at-home HbA1c kits prompting evaluation in the absence of symptoms. Four patients required emergency department evaluation. Five patients presented with ketosis. All patients were prescribed CGM at the first visit, most starting within 1 month. Conclusions: Technology is extraordinarily useful for the care of young persons with new-onset T1D in the ambulatory setting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Large observational studies are needed to better understand outcomes of an outpatient, technology-focused approach.","Kaushal, Tara; Ambler-Osborn, Louise; Turcotte, Christine; Quinn, Heidi; Laffel, Lori",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33857385/,427
149892,Publishing in a pandemic.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND The Chicago Classification (CC) uses high-resolution manometry (HRM) software tools to designate esophageal motor diagnoses. We evaluated changes in diagnostic designations between two CC versions, and determined motor patterns not identified by either version. METHODS In this observational cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing esophageal HRM over a 6-year period, proportions meeting CC 2.0 and 3.0 criteria were segregated into esophageal outflow obstruction, hypermotility, and hypomotility disorders. Contraction wave abnormalities (CWA), and 'normal' cohorts were recorded. Symptom burden was characterized using dominant symptom intensity and global symptom severity. Motor diagnoses, presenting symptoms, and symptom burden were compared between CC 2.0 and 3.0, and in cohorts not meeting CC diagnoses. KEY RESULTS Of 2569 eligible studies, 49.9% met CC 2.0 criteria, but only 40.3% met CC 3.0 criteria (P<.0001). Between CC 2.0 and 3.0, 82.8% of diagnoses were concordant. Discordance resulted from decreasing proportions of hypermotility (4.4%) and hypomotility (9.0%) disorders, and increase in 'normal' designations (13.0%); esophageal outflow obstruction showed the least variation between CC versions. Symptom burden was higher with CC 3.0 diagnoses (P≤.005) but not with CC 2.0 diagnoses (P≥.1). Within 'normal' cohorts for both CC versions, CWA were associated with higher likelihood of esophageal symptoms, especially dysphagia, regurgitation, and heartburn, compared to truly normal studies (P≤.02 for each comparison). CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES Despite lower sensitivity, CC 3.0 identifies esophageal motor disorders with higher symptom burden compared to CC 2.0. CWA, which are associated with both transit and perceptive symptoms, are not well identified by either version.","Patel, A; Cassell, B; Sainani, N; Wang, D; Shahid, B; Bennett, M; Mirza, F A; Munigala, S; Gyawali, C P",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.13042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28229560/,427
150167,Exercise Trials in Pediatric Brain Tumor: A Systematic Review of Randomized Studies.,2020-06-26,"Aim of the study Probiotic administration to preterm infants has the potential to prevent necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). Data from randomised controlled trials (RCT) are conflicting but meta-analyses seem to support this intervention. To date, these analyses have not focused on surgical NEC. We aimed to determine the effect of probiotic administration to preterm infants on prevention of surgical NEC. Methods A systematic review of RCTs of probiotic administration to preterm infants was performed. Studies were included if RCT outcomes included any of (1) Bell's stage 3 NEC; (2) surgery for NEC; and (3) deaths attributable to NEC. Article selection and data extraction were performed independently by two authors; conflicts were adjudicated by a third author. Data were meta-analysed using Review Manager V.5.3. A random effects model was decided on a priori because of the heterogeneity of study design; data are risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. Main results Thirty-five RCTs reported NEC as an outcome. Seventeen reported surgical NEC; all RCTs were included. A variety of probiotic products was administered across studies. Description of surgical NEC in most studies was poor. Only 6/16 specifically reported incidence of surgery for NEC, 12/17 Bell's stage 3 and 13/17 NEC-associated mortality. Although there was a trend towards probiotic administration reducing stage 3 NEC, this was not significant (RR 0.74 (0.52-1.05), p=0.09). There was no effect of probiotics on the RR of surgery for NEC (RR 0.84 (0.56-1.25), p=0.38). Probiotics did, however, reduce the risk of NEC-associated mortality (RR 0.56 (0.34-0.93), p=0.03). Conclusion Despite 35 RCTs on probiotic prevention of NEC, evidence for prevention of surgical NEC is not strong, partly due to poor reporting. In studies included in this meta-analysis, probiotic administration was associated with a reduction in NEC-related mortality.","Rees, Clare M; Hall, Nigel J; Fleming, Paul; Eaton, Simon",BMJ paediatrics open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2017-000066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29637113/,427

Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a serious threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates, but knowledge of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. To investigate the diversity of infectious agents causing strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan, a disease survey was conducted from 2010 to 2018, and Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis with internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms/nurseries in Taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), a species not previously known to be associated with strawberry, Colletotrichum karstii (6%), and three known species, Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%), were identified. The predominant species C. siamense and C. fructicola exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on wounded and non-wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves.

At 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after administration, analysis of bosutinib C0 and creatinine was performed at the same time of day. Significant correlations were observed between bosutinib C0 and the change rate of serum creatinine or the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; r = 0.328, P < 0.001 and r = - 0.315, P < 0.001, respectively). These correlations were particularly high in patients having the SLC22A2 808G/G genotype (r = 0.345 and r = - 0.329, respectively); however, in patients having the 808T allele, there were no significant differences. In multivariate analyses, the SLC22A2 808G/G genotype, patient age, bosutinib C0 and second-line or later bosutinib were independent factors influencing the change rate of creatinine. Bosutinib elevated serum creatinine through organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2). We observed a 20% increase in serum creatinine with a median bosutinib C0 of 63.4-73.2 ng/mL. Periodic measurement of serum creatinine after bosutinib therapy is necessary to avoid progression to severe renal dysfunction from simple elevation of creatinine mediated by OCT2 following bosutinib treatment.","Abumiya, Maiko; Takahashi, Naoto; Takahashi, Saori; Yoshioka, Tomoko; Kameoka, Yoshihiro; Miura, Masatomo",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85757-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737618/,427

METHODS The presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive antibodies in the sera of 673 blood donors residing in south-western Germany before and 3,880 donors after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic was determined and confirmed using two highly sensitive serological tests. RESULTS Approximately 0.40% of the donors assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic possessed SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive antibodies, decidedly fewer than the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals determined by real-time RT-PCR nationwide.

However, whether ZNF367 plays a role in colorectal cancer has not been fully understood. Our data showed that ZNF367 expression was higher in colorectal cancer. Depletion of ZNF367 weakened the proliferative and invasive capabilities of colorectal cancer cells. Up-regulation of ZNF367 enhanced the in vitro malignant features of colorectal cancer cells. Knockdown of ZNF367 impeded the activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP1). Reactivation of YAP1 reversed the ZNF367-knockdown-mediated anticancer effects. Suppression of YAP1 significantly abolished ZNF367-overexpression-induced tumor-promotion effects. Depletion of ZNF367 repressed the tumorigenicity of colorectal cancer cells in vivo. These findings demonstrate that ZNF367 is overexpressed in colorectal cancer and acts as a potential tumor-promoter that contributes to the proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer by enhancing the activation of YAP1 signaling.","Lei, Ting; Gao, Ya; Duan, Yuhong; Cui, Chunli; Zhang, Li; Si, Mingming",Environmental toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1002/tox.23341; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34351699/,427
153235,Responding to the need to curate global informatics definitions.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Healthcare workers perform clinical behaviours which impact on patient diagnoses, care, treatment and recovery. Some methods of supporting healthcare workers in changing their behaviour make use of social norms by exposing healthcare workers to the beliefs, values, attitudes or behaviours of a reference group or person. This review aimed to evaluate evidence on (i) the effect of social norms interventions on healthcare worker clinical behaviour change and (ii) the contexts, modes of delivery and behaviour change techniques (BCTs) associated with effectiveness. METHODS Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Searches were undertaken in seven databases. The primary outcome was compliance with a desired healthcare worker clinical behaviour and the secondary outcome was patient health outcomes. Outcomes were converted into standardised mean differences (SMDs). We performed meta-analyses and presented forest plots, stratified by five social norms BCTs (social comparison, credible source, social reward, social incentive and information about others' approval). Sources of variation in social norms BCTs, context and mode of delivery were explored using forest plots, meta-regression and network meta-analysis. RESULTS Combined data from 116 trials suggested that social norms interventions were associated with an improvement in healthcare worker clinical behaviour outcomes of 0.08 SMDs (95%CI 0.07 to 0.10) (n = 100 comparisons), and an improvement in patient health outcomes of 0.17 SMDs (95%CI 0.14 to 0.20) (n = 14), on average. Heterogeneity was high, with an overall I2 of 85.4% (healthcare worker clinical behaviour) and 91.5% (patient health outcomes). Credible source was more effective on average, compared to control conditions (SMD 0.30, 95%CI 0.13 to 0.47, n = 7). Social comparison also appeared effective, both on its own (SMD 0.05, 95%CI 0.03 to 0.08, n = 33) and with other BCTs, and seemed particularly effective when combined with prompts/cues (0.33, 95%CI 0.22 to 0.44, n = 5). CONCLUSIONS Social norms interventions appeared to be an effective method of changing the clinical behaviour of healthcare workers and have a positive effect on patient health outcomes in a variety of health service contexts. Although the overall result is modest and variable, there is the potential for social norms interventions to be applied at large scale.

OBJECTIVE To study the clinical outcomes of patients with a stroke transferred directly to ECCs compared with those transferred to ECCs from non-endovascular capable centers (nECCs). METHODS Data from the STRATIS registry were analyzed to evaluate process and clinical outcomes under five routing policies: (1) transport to nearest nECC; (2) transport to STRATIS ECC over any distance or (3) within 20 miles; (4) transport to ideal ECC (iECC), over any distance or (5) within 20 miles. RESULTS Among 236 patients, 117 (49.6%) were transferred by ground, of whom 62 (53%) were transferred within 20 miles. Median MT start time was accelerated in all direct transport models. IVT start was prolonged with direct transport across all distances, but accelerated with direct transport to iECC ≤20 miles. With bypass limited to ≤20 miles, the median modeled EMS arrival to IVT interval decreased for both iECCs and ECCs (by 12 min and 6 min, respectively), and median EMS arrival to puncture time decreased by up to 94 min. In this cohort, no patient would have become ineligible for IVT. Bypass to iECC modeling under 20 miles showed a significant reduction in the level of disability at 3 months, with freedom from disability (modified Rankin Scale score 0-1) at 3 months increased by 12%. CONCLUSIONS Direct routing of patients with a large vessel occlusion to ECCs, especially when within 20 miles, may lead to better clinical outcomes by accelerating the start of MT without any delay of IVT.

155339,Transience and hope: A return to Freud in a time of pandemic.,2021-02-01,"Purpose: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is an acute respiratory illness. Although most infected persons are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms, some patients progress to devastating disease; such progression is difficult to predict or identify in a timely manner. COVID-19 patients who do not require hospitalization can self-isolate at home. Calls from one disease epicenter identify the need for homebased isolation with telemedicine surveillance to monitor for impending deterioration. Methodology: Although the dominant approach for these asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic patients is to monitor oxygen saturation, we suggest additionally considering the potential merits and utility of home-based imaging. Chest computed tomography is clearly impractical, but ultrasound has shown comparable sensitivity for lung involvement, with major advantages of short and simple procedures, low cost, and excellent repeatability. Thoracic ultrasound may thus allow remotely identifying the development of pneumonitis at an early stage of illness and potentially averting the risk of insidious deterioration to severe pneumonia and critical illness while in home isolation. Conclusions: Lung sonography can be easily performed by motivated nonmedical caregivers when directed and supervised in real time by experts. Remote mentors could thus efficiently monitor, counsel, and triage multiple home-based patients from their ""control center."" Authors believe that this approach deserves further attention and study to reduce delays and failures in timely hospitalization of home-isolated patients.","Kirkpatrick, Andrew W; McKee, Jessica L; Volpicelli, Giovanni; Ma, Irene W Y",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32654656/,427

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed our stroke database and included all patients treated with the Baby Trevo for distal LVOs in AIS. Patient gender, mean age, vascular risk factors, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at presentation, and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at baseline and 90-day follow-up were documented. Reperfusion rates for the vessels treated were recorded using the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) classification. Occurrence of vasospasm and new or evolving infarcts in the treated vascular territory was documented. RESULTS Thirty-five subjects with a mean NIHSS score of 18 were included. The Baby Trevo device was used in 38 branches of the anterior and posterior circulations. TICI 2b/3 blood flow was restored after one single pass in 20/38 (52.6%) and after two or three passes in 11 vessels. The remaining vessels required either more than three passes, showed less than a TICI 2b/3 reperfusion (n=3), or demonstrated failure to retrieve the clot (n=4). TICI 2b/3 reperfusion was achieved in 30 patients (85.7%). No vessel injuries, rupture, or significant vasospasm were seen. Overall, a mRS score of ≤2 was seen in 56.5% of the subjects successfully treated with the Baby Trevo at 90 days and in 81.3% of surviving patients; seven patients died (20%). CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary data suggest that the 'Baby Trevo' achieves a high recanalization rate without any significant risk.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of extended delay to surgery for stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA. During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with NSCLC may experience delays in care, and some national guidelines recommend delays in surgery by >3 months for early NSCLC. METHODS. Using data from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a multi-center randomized trial, and the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB), a multi-institutional oncology registry, the impact of ""early"" versus ""delayed"" surgery (surgery received 0-30 versus 90-120 days following diagnosis) for stage I lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma was assessed using multivariable Cox regression analysis with penalized smoothing spline functions and propensity score-matched analyses. RESULTS. In Cox regression analysis of the NLST (n = 452) and NCDB (n = 80,086) cohorts, an increase in the hazard ratio (HR) was seen the longer surgery was delayed. In propensity score-matched analysis, no differences in survival were found between early and delayed surgery for stage IA1 adenocarcinoma and IA1-IA3 squamous cell carcinoma (all P > 0.13). For stage IA2-IB adenocarcinoma and IB squamous cell carcinoma, delayed surgery was associated with worse survival (all P < 0.004). CONCLUSIONS. The mortality risk associated with an extended delay to surgery differs across patient subgroups, and decisions to delay care during the COVID pandemic should take substage and histologic subtype into consideration. For stage IA1 adenocarcinoma and IA squamous cell carcinoma, delaying surgery may be considered; however, for IA2-IB adenocarcinoma and IB squamous cell carcinoma, early surgery-when feasible-should be encouraged.","Mayne, Nicholas R; Elser, Holly; Darling, Alice J; Raman, Vignesh; Liou, Douglas; Colson, Yolonda; D'Amico, Thomas A; Yang, Chi-Fu Jeffrey",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33630435/,427

CBD's reputation as a cure-all puts it in the same class as other ""natural"" panaceas, where valid ethnobotanicals are reduced to single, purportedly active ingredients. Such reductionist approaches oversimplify useful, chemically complex mixtures in an attempt to rationalize the commercial utility of natural compounds and exploit the ""natural"" label. Literature evidence associates CBD with certain semi-ubiquitous, broadly-screened, primarily plant-based substances of undocumented purity that interfere with bioassays and have a low likelihood of becoming therapeutic agents. Widespread health challenges and pandemic crises such as SARS-CoV-2 create circumstances under which scientists must be particularly vigilant about healing claims that lack solid foundational data.

METHODS A literature review of PubMed, ResearchGate, ScienceDirect, the Cochrane Library, and TCM monographs was conducted and the effects of the plants on the cardiovascular system and the mechanisms of action in COVID-19 treatment were evaluated. RESULTS The mechanism of action, cardiovascular effects, and possible toxicity of 10 plants frequently found in TCM formulations that were used in the clinical treatment of COVID-19 were examined. CONCLUSION TCM formulations that had been originally developed for earlier viral diseases have been used in COVID-19 treatment. Despite the effectiveness seen in laboratory and animal studies with the most commonly used plants in these formulations, the clinical studies are currently insufficient according to standard operating procedures. More clinical studies are needed to understand the safe clinical use of traditional plants.","Akalın, Emine; Ekici, Miraç; Alan, Zinar; Özbir Elevli, Elif; Yaman Bucak, Aysenur; Aobuliaikemu, Nuerbiye; Üresin, Ali Yağız",Turk Kardiyoloji Dernegi arsivi : Turk Kardiyoloji Derneginin yayin organidir,https://doi.org/10.5543/tkda.2020.03374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32519978/,427
160972,COVID-19 Pandemic Response Simulation in a Large City: Impact of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions on Reopening Society.,2021-03-18,"BACKGROUND The superficial runoff veins anatomically run alongside the cutaneous nerves in the volar forearm. Consequently, the surgical repair of vascular access (VA)-associated venous aneurysms attached to the cutaneous nerves could cause intraoperative nerve injury. Therefore, we proposed a cutaneous nerve-conscious VA-related aneurysmal repair assisted by nerve ultrasonography. This ultrasonography aids in the preoperative examination of the courses of the nerves neighboring the aneurysm. METHODS Sixteen consecutive patients who underwent surgical revisions of VA-related aneurysms (14 venous aneurysms and two arterial pseudoaneurysms) were enrolled. The locations of aneurysms derived from preexisting arteriovenous fistulas included 11 radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas in the wrist or distally, three radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas at the antecubital fossa, and two brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas at the antecubital fossa or in the distal upper arm. A preoperative ultrasonographic scan of the cutaneous nerve trunks that ran peripherally toward and along the aneurysms was attempted to avoid nerve injuries during operations. Basically, the aneurysms were resected from the proximal to the distal ends after being separated from the preserved adjacent nerves. RESULTS The cutaneous nerve trunks that coursed toward and along the aneurysm could be identified by preoperative ultrasonography and could be preserved intraoperatively based on ultrasonographic findings in all patients. In four patients, the cutaneous nerve branch was unexpectedly or intentionally severed for a seamless surgical process because the nerve branch that divided from the cutaneous nerve trunk was strongly attached to the aneurysm. They subsequently suffered from hypoesthesia, but did not experience neuropathic pain. CONCLUSION Preoperative ultrasonographic examination of the cutaneous nerve facilitated the intraoperative prevention of cutaneous nerve injury in VA-related aneurysmectomy. Nerve-sparing VA surgery assisted by preoperative nerve ultrasonography based on the understanding of topological anatomy might contribute to the reduction in postoperative neuropathy and enhance comfort in the daily life of hemodialysis patients.","Matsuda, Hiroaki; Oka, Yoshinari; Yoshida, Ryuichi; Takatsu, Shigeko; Miyazaki, Masashi",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.1177/1129729820959927; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985325/,427

To discover therapeutic strategies reducing the spread of α-synuclein aggregation, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR interference screen in a human cell-based model. We discovered that inhibiting PIKfyve dramatically reduced α-synuclein aggregation induced with both recombinant α-synuclein fibrils and fibrils isolated from MSA patient brain. While PIKfyve inhibition did not affect fibril uptake or α-synuclein clearance or secretion, it reduced α-synuclein trafficking from the early endosome to the lysosome, thereby limiting fibril escape from the lysosome and reducing the amount of fibrils that reach cytosolic α-synuclein to induce aggregation. These findings point to the endolysosomal transport of fibrils as a critical step in the propagation of α-synuclein aggregation and a potential therapeutic target.","See, Stephanie K.; Chen, Merissa; Bax, Sophie; Tian, Ruilin; Woerman, Amanda; Tse, Eric; Johnson, Isabel E.; Nowotny, Carlos; Muñoz, Elise N.; Sengstack, Janine; Southworth, Daniel R.; Gestwicki, Jason E.; Leonetti, Manuel D.; Kampmann, Martin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.21.427704,427

The SDSS focuses on the management of public spaces as a resource to increase a vulnerable population’s accessibility to essential goods and services. Using a web-based platform, the SDSS would support data-driven decisions, especially for cases such as the COVID-19 pandemic which requires special care in quarantine situations (which imply walking access instead of by other means of transport). Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes a methodology to create a web-SDSS to manage public spaces in the planning and response phase of a disaster to increase the access to essential goods and services. Using a regular polygon grid, a city is partitioned into spatial units that aggregate spatial data from open and proprietary sources. The polygon grid is then used to compute accessibility, vulnerability and population density indicators using spatial analysis. Finally, a facility location problem is formulated and solved to provide decision-makers with an adaptive selection of public spaces given their indicators of choice. Findings: The design and implementation of the methodology resulted in a granular representation of the city of Lima, Peru, in terms of population density, accessibility and vulnerability. Using these indicators, the SDSS was deployed as a web application that allowed decision-makers to explore different solutions to a facility location model within their districts, as well as visualizing the indicators computed for the hexagons that covered the district’s area. By performing tests with different local authorities, improvements were suggested to support a more general set of decisions and the key indicators to use in the SDSS were determined. Originality/value: This paper, following the literature gap, is the first of its kind that presents an SDSS focused on increasing access to essential goods and services using public spaces and has had a successful response from local authorities with different backgrounds regarding the integration into their decision-making process. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Regal Ludowieg, A.; Ortega, C.; Bronfman, A.; Rodriguez Serra, M.; Chong, M.",Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/jhlscm-02-2021-0012,427

Objective: To develop a decision support tool that assists college administrators in designing and evaluating customized COVID vaccination, screening, and prevention plans. Design: Decision analysis linked to a compartmental epidemic model, quantifying the interaction of policy instruments (e.g., vaccination promotion, asymptomatic testing, physical distancing, and other non-pharmaceutical interventions), institutional priorities (e.g., risk tolerance, desire to resume activities), and assumptions about vaccine performance and background epidemic severity. Participants: Hypothetical cohort of 5000 individuals (students, faculty, and staff) living and working in the close environs of a residential college campus. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Cumulative infections over a 120-day semester. Results: Under Base Case assumptions, if 90% coverage with an 85%-effective vaccine can be attained, the model finds that campus activities can be fully resumed while holding cumulative cases below 5% of the population without the need for routine, asymptomatic testing. With 50% population coverage using such a vaccine, a similar return to normalcy would require daily asymptomatic testing of unvaccinated individuals. The effectiveness of vaccination in reducing susceptibility to infection is a critical uncertainty. Conclusions & Relevance: Vaccination coverage is the most powerful tool available to college administrators to achieve a safe return to pre-pandemic operations this fall. Given the breadth of potential outcomes in the face of uncontrollable and uncertain factors, even colleges that achieve high vaccination coverage should be prepared to reinstitute testing and distancing policies on short notice.","Paltiel, A.

BRII-196 and BRII-198 are two anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal neutralizing antibodies with modified Fc region that extends half-life and are being developed as cocktail therapy for the treatment of COVID-19. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of BRII-196 and BRII-198 were investigated in healthy adults. Methods. Single ascending doses of BRII-196 and BRII-198 were evaluated in parallel in the first-in-human, placebo-controlled phase 1 studies. A total of 32 healthy adults were randomized and received a single intravenous infusion of 750, 1500, and 3000 mg of BRII-196 (n=12), BRII-198 (n=12), or placebo (n=8) and were followed for 180 days. Results. All infusions were well tolerated at infusion rates between 0.5 mL/min to 4 mL/min with no dose-limiting adverse events, deaths, serious adverse events, or any systemic or local infusion reactions.

163403,IoMT: Rinku's Clinical Kit Applied to Collect Information Related to COVID-19 Through Medical Sensors,2021,"In response to the COVID‐19 crisis, numerous academic conferences and seminars were moved online. Some remote (online) seminars have the aim to be maintained permanently after the pandemic, offering weekly opportunities for scientists, postdocs, and students to learn about research and to improve global networking. Remote seminars are a good option to promote inclusion and diversity, allowing students worldwide to participate and to interact with researchers from a broad cultural and ethnic background. Capitalizing on our experience with the ongoing International Remote Seminar on Frontiers in Social Evolution (FINE), we propose four teaching tools that can be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses and that can be adapted for use with most remote seminar series. We make recommendations for the use of: (i) Certified remote seminar attendance. (ii) Relevant articles from the primary literature. (iii) Teaching slides, and (iv) Recorded seminars. Our aims are to promote and facilitate the use of the proposed teaching tools in Animal Behavior and related courses, and to encourage other remote seminar organizers to make teaching tools available.

163480,A Structured Professional Development Curriculum for Postdoctoral Fellows Leads to Recognized Knowledge Growth,2021-03-04,"The phenomenon of geo-blocking is one of the new challenges of the digital era. Geo-blocking is a modern form of discrimination that differentiates between consumers on the basis of their geographical location. The phenomenon ultimately affects the situation of the citizen concerned and may also constitute an obstacle to the single market. Digital time has put a number of issues to be resolved on the legislator’s table in recent years, one of which is the phenomenon of geo-blocking. Already in 2015, the European Commission led by Juncker (2014–2019) adopted the Digital Single Market (DSM) strategy, which marked the European Union’s (EU) path towards innovation by creating a new digital dimension of the Single Market. In order to achieve the DSM strategy and the digital objectives, a number of legislative acts have been put in place to address the elements of the DSM and exploit the benefits of technological modernisation. The geo-blocking phenomenon is presented in this study, partly in terms of practical aspects and partly with regard to the geo-blocking regulation. The Ursula von der Leyen-led Commission (2019–2024) identifies “a Europe fit for the digital age” among its six priorities. Among the priorities, the “promotion of a European way of life”, must be linked to the digital priorities, as our smart tools and our digital presence are becoming an integral part of our lives – and our common way of life – especially at this time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Innovation has also been accelerated by the current exceptional situation, the health emergency caused by COVID-19, forcing us to work remotely, remote contacts and the constant use of our smart tools. The realisation of digital well-being is therefore also an integral part of our lifestyle. In the intersection of digitalisation and development and the promotion of a common European way of life, we can find a single market in which we can experience a significant aspect of our European way of life – the free movements and cross-border transactions – even through our online presence. The internal market is the dimension for the proper functioning of which the Union institutions can adopt a legislative act. In addition, measures taken to remove barriers and remove obstacles are essential for the functioning of the internal market. Joint action against geo-blocking as an internal market barrier will also play a role in creating digital prosperity by promoting the proper functioning of the internal market by promoting e-commerce and electronic content access. The aim of the study on the one hand is to present issues related to geo-blocking in a brief and descriptive manner from the perspective of the social, economic and legal environment linked to the internal market. On the other hand, the study briefly presents the legal environment of geo-blocking in the USA, Russia, China and Japan. © 2021 Sciendo. All rights reserved.","Hamuľák, O.; Kiss, L.

Therefore, advanced calculation techniques are needed to obtain accurate results of the consumption prediction, taking into account the numerous exogenous factors that influence the results’ precision. The purpose of this study is to integrate, additionally to the conventional factors (weather, holidays, etc.), the current aspects regarding the global COVID-19 pandemic in solving the STLF problem, using a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model. To evaluate and validate the impact of the new variables considered in the model, the simulations are conducted using publicly available data from the Romanian power system. A comparison study is further carried out to assess the performance of the proposed model, using the multiple linear regression method and load forecasting results provided by the Romanian Transmission System Operator (TSO). In this regard, the Mean Squared Error (MSE), the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are used as evaluation indexes. The proposed methodology shows great potential, as the results reveal better error values compared to the TSO results, despite the limited historical data.","Tudose, Andrei M.; Picioroaga, Irina I.; Sidea, Dorian O.; Bulac, Constantin Boicea Valentin A.",Energies,https://doi.org/10.3390/en14134046,427
163863,"10 minutes with Sanjay Saint, Chief of Medicine, Veterans Administration Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Michigan, USA",2020,"Background The second wave of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in England has been characterized by high growth and prevalence in the North with lower prevalence in the South. High prevalence was first observed at younger adult ages before spreading out to school-aged children and older adults. Local tiered interventions were in place up to 5th November 2020 at which time a second national lockdown was implemented. Methods REACT-1 is a repeated cross-sectional survey of SARS-CoV-2 swab-positivity in random samples of the population of England. The current period of data collection (round 7) commenced on 13th November 2020 and we report interim results here for swabs collected up to and including 24th November 2020. Because there were two distinct periods of growth during the previous round 6, here we compare results from round 7 (mainly) with the second half of round 6, which obtained swabs between 26th October and 2nd November 2020. We report prevalence both unweighted and reweighted to be representative of the population of England. We describe trends in unweighted prevalence with daily growth rates, doubling times, reproduction numbers (R) and splines. We estimated odds ratios for swab-positivity using mutually-adjusted multivariable logistic regression models. Results We found 821 positives from 105,123 swabs giving an unweighted prevalence of 0.78% (95% CI, 0.73%, 0.84%) and a weighted prevalence of 0.96% (0.87%, 1.05%).The weighted prevalence estimate was ~30% lower than that of 1.32% (1.20%, 1.45%) obtained in the second half of round 6. This decrease corresponds to a halving time of 37 (30, 47) days and an R number of 0.88 (0.86, 0.91). Using only data from the most recent period, we estimate an R number of 0.71 (0.54, 0.90). A spline fit to prevalence showed a rise shortly after the previous period of data collection followed by a fall coinciding with the start of lockdown. The national trends were driven mainly by reductions in higher-prevalence northern regions, with prevalence approximately unchanged in the Midlands and London, and smaller reductions in southern lower-prevalence regions. Sub-regional analyses showed variable changes in prevalence at the local level including marked declines in the North, but also local areas of growth in East and West Midlands. Mutually adjusted models in the most recent period indicated: people of Asian ethnicity, those living in the most deprived neighbourhoods, and those living inthe largest households, had higher odds of swab-positivity. Conclusion Three weeks into the second national lockdown in England there has been a ~30% proportionate reduction in prevalence overall, with greater reductions in the North. As a result, inter-regional heterogeneity has reduced, although average absolute prevalence remains high at ~1%. Continued monitoring of the epidemic in the community remains essential until prevalence is reliably suppressed to much lower levels, for example, through widespread vaccination.","Riley, S.; Eales, O.; Walters, C.

Many other phytochemicals are also present in dry fruits and shows significant antioxidant activity that further correlated to get rid of many health complications. These fruits are commonly known as dry fruits or super foods with the rich content of proteins, vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. They are well known for their immuno modulatory activities with various medicinal applications, especially as antiviral activity. The ongoing COVID outbreak has posed a serious threat to global health sector. At present, the second wave of coronavirus is already has started and gradually increasing day by day in worldwide which arestronger and much more detrimental for the people including in India. In connection with the previous history, it is obvious to increase immunity to fight against the pandemic virus. In the present manuscript, some important dry fruits and seeds are selected which have dual characters, i.e., potent immune boosting property along with antiviral efficacy. Various phytochemicals like flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, sesquiterpenes, benzoic compounds were reportedly isolated from these plant extracts those are having strong antiviral as well as immune boosting properties. Therefore, the detail study of these dry fruits and seeds with their sources, chemicals responsible for the therapeutic efficacy, their structural nature, and potent uses along with their combined preparations as home as remedies in boosting immunity and also to resist the viral infection are discussed. The article will focus to the researchers for detailed ethnopharmacological and phytochemical studies on these dry fruit and seed plants used to treat as immuno modulators as well as in the development of novel antiviral drugs.","Singirikonda, S.; Khan, M.

163923,Museums and Heritage in the Digital Age. the Challenge of Cultural Change and Technological Innovation,2021,"Sharp-wave/ripples are brief, high-frequency events in hippocampal subregions CA3 and CA1 that occur during rest or pauses in behavior. Ripples detected in CA1 have lower frequency in aged compared to young rats. Although CA1 ripples are theorized to manifest from CA3, ripple dynamics in CA3 have not been examined in aged animals. The current study obtained simultaneous recordings between CA1 and CA3 in young and aged rats to examine sharp-wave/ripple characteristics in both regions in relation to age. While CA1 ripple frequency was reduced with age, there were no age differences in CA3 ripples. In aged, but not young, rats there was also a significant increase in the probability of CA3 and CA1 ripples co-occurring between the pre- and post-behavior rest epochs. Moreover, in both age groups, CA1 ripples that co-occurred with a CA3 ripple had increased frequency, power, and duration. These findings suggest age differences in CA1 are not due to altered afferent input from CA3, but instead reflect distinct mechanisms of ripple generation with age. HIGHLIGHTS CA1 ripple frequency is reduced with age. CA3 ripple characteristics do not change with age. In aged rats only, CA3-CA1 ripple co-occurrence increased following behavior. CA1 ripples that co-occurred with CA3 had greater frequency, power, and duration.","DiCola, Nicholas M.; Lacy, Alexa L.; Bishr, Omar J.; Kimsey, Kathryn M.; Whitney, Jenna L.; Lovett, Sarah D.; Burke, Sara N.; Maurer, Andrew P.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.27.457373,427

164273,Introduction to the Special Issue on Covid-19,2021,"Two different sarbecoviruses have caused major human outbreaks in the last two decades1,2. Both these sarbecoviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, engage ACE2 via the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD)2–6. However, binding to ACE2 orthologs from humans, bats, and other species has been observed only sporadically among the broader diversity of bat sarbecoviruses7–11. Here, we use high-throughput assays12 to trace the evolutionary history of ACE2 binding across a diverse range of sarbecoviruses and ACE2 orthologs. We find that ACE2 binding is an ancestral trait of sarbecovirus RBDs that has subsequently been lost in some clades. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that bat sarbecoviruses from outside Asia can bind ACE2. In addition, ACE2 binding is highly evolvable: for many sarbecovirus RBDs there are single amino-acid mutations that enable binding to new ACE2 orthologs. However, the effects of individual mutations can differ markedly between viruses, as illustrated by the N501Y mutation which enhances human ACE2 binding affinity within several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern12 but severely dampens it for SARS-CoV-1. Our results point to the deep ancestral origin and evolutionary plasticity of ACE2 binding, broadening consideration of the range of sarbecoviruses with spillover potential.","Starr, Tyler N.; Zepeda, Samantha K.; Walls, Alexandra C.; Greaney, Allison J.; Veesler, David; Bloom, Jesse D.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.17.452804,427

Cluster-based designs can be less costly but also less efficient than individual-based designs due to correlation between individuals within the same cluster. Their design typically relies on \textit{ad hoc} choices of correlation parameters, and is insensitive to variations in cluster design. This article examines how to efficiently design clusters where they are geographically defined by demarcating areas incorporating individuals and households or other units. Using geostatistical models for spatial autocorrelation we generate approximations to within cluster average covariance in order to estimate the effective sample size given particular cluster design parameters. We show how the number of enumerated locations, cluster area, proportion sampled, and sampling method affect the efficiency of the design and consider the optimization problem of choosing the most efficient design subject to budgetary constraints. We also consider how the parameters from these approximations can be interpreted simply in terms of `real-world' quantities and used in design analysis.","Watson, Samuel I.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11850v1.pdf,427

As we are now well aware, wearing a mask while stepping out in public places is imperative. In this context, our current work aims to build an end-to-end application-based system that scans people's faces to determine whether they are wearing a face mask or not, or if they are wearing it improperly. It is a real-time system that provides feedback instantly. At the same time, different types of data obtained from the triple classification system are stored in a simple database to further visualize the same. The system we have created utilizes Single Shot Detector (SSD), a deep learning architecture, to extract a face from a given video frame, and MobileNetV2, another deep learning architecture, to classify it into one of the three categories mentioned above. Those without or improperly wearing a mask, are warned by the system. This work also makes use of QR (Quick Response) codes to identify the people in the video feed. Dataframes from Pandas in Python are used to organize the acquired data into a structured format which is then exported to Tableau.

164503,"Mass Hysteria, Manufacturing Crisis and the Legal Reconstruction of Acceptable Exercise during a Pandemic",2020,"PurposeThe coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic mobilized the international scientific community in the search for its cure and containment. The purpose of this paper is to examine the nature of the rapid response to the COVID-19 of the scientific community in selected Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico) in the period running from January to August 2020. Rapid response is reconceptualized from its original meaning in health policy, as the swift mobilization of existing scientific resources to address an emergency (DeVita et al., 2017).Design/methodology/approachThe paper explores the rapid response of the Argentinian, Brazilian, Chilean, Colombian and Mexican scientific communities from the perspective of bibliometric and altmetric data. The authors will examine scientific publications indexed to the Web of Science (WoS) dealing with COVID-19. Besides patterns of scientific output and impact as measured by citations, the authors complement the analysis with altmetric analysis. The aim is to verify whether or not factors that explain the extent of scientific impact can also be identified with respect to the wider impact made evident by altmetric indicators (Haustein, 2016).FindingsThe authors identified a somewhat limited response of the Argentinian, Brazilian, Chilean, Colombian and Mexican scientific communities to COVID-19 in terms of quantity of publications. The authorship of publications in the topic of COVID-19 was associated with authorship of publications dealing with locally relevant diseases. Some factors appear to contribute to visibility of scientific outputs. Papers that involved wider international collaborations and authors with previous publications in arboviruses were associated with higher levels of citations. Previous work on arbovirus was also associated with higher altmetric attention. The country of origin of authors exerted a positive effect on altmetric indicators.Research limitations/implicationsA limitation in the analysis is that, due to the nature of the data source (WoS), the authors were unable to verify the career status and the productivity of the authors in the sample. Nonetheless, the results appear to suggest that there is some overlapping in authors conducting research in Arboviruses and COVID-19. Career status and productivity should be the focus of future research.Practical implicationsIn the context of countries with limited scientific resources, like the ones investigated in our Latin American sample, previous efforts in the study of locally relevant diseases may contribute to the creation of an expertise that can be applied when a health emergency brings about a novel disease.Originality/valueThe originality of the paper rests on the fact that the authors identified that previous work on arbovirus contributed to the scientific visibility of publications on COVID-19.","Janaina Pamplona da, Costa André Luiz Sica de Campos Cintra Paulo Roberto Liz Felix Greco Poker Johan Hendrik",Online Information Review,https://doi.org/10.1108/oir-09-2020-0391,427

In particular, increased use of computer simulations can help us identify underlying mechanisms for pathologies and which treatments may be best suited for them when in-person appointments are not feasible. For example, long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiac condition that can lead to potentially fatal arrhythmias. One of the most common long QT syndromes, LQT1, causes structural abnormalities of potassium ion channels that in turn reduce certain potassium currents at the cellular level in the heart. In this paper, we use the extracellular-membrane-intracellular (EMI) model to simulate the effects of LQTS. The EMI model resolves the detailed characteristics of individual cell membranes, which is where the affected ion channels are localized, thus making it uniquely suitable for studying such effects. We compare simulations from data from healthy cells, cells that exhibit LQT1 syndrome, and cells that have been treated with a drug to restore healthy heart function. These simulations demonstrate that advances in biomedical engineering combined with computer simulation can enhance the power and applicability of telemedicine well beyond the current state. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Domínguez, S.; Reimer, J.; Green, K.

Early planning and preparedness are vital in mitigation of the impact of the ongoing pandemic. The lessons from previous public health emergencies of the 21st century such as Influenza A (H1N1), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Ebola elucidate that the risks assessment associated with disease outbreaks remains integral for the successful response curbing health disasters. Every pandemic or public health emergency poses new challenges. Alike, the SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19 will continue to challenge public health systems and their ability to effectively communicate with the public. Till date, no vaccines and specific antiviral drugs are available moreover there is little evidence on the effectiveness of potential therapeutic agents. Many countries have practiced 'stay-at-home', social distancing, avoided mass gathering, closure of education in institutions, strict public health measures like compulsory wearing of masks, entertainment and public spaces. For effective prevention and control of any infectious diseases the risk assessment and communication are of prime importance. Hence, there is an urgent need to commence SARS-CoV-2 risk assessment for assisting decision-making bodies working on SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Methods We measured IgA, IgG and IgM levels against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens from the wild-type and S from the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants of concern, after BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccination in a cohort of health care workers (N=578). Neutralizing capacity and antibody avidity were evaluated. Data were analyzed in relation to COVID-19 history, comorbidities, vaccine doses, brand and adverse events. Findings Vaccination induced robust IgA and IgG levels against all S antigens. Neutralization capacity and S IgA and IgG levels were higher in mRNA-1273 vaccinees, previously SARS-CoV-2 exposed, particularly if symptomatic, and in those experiencing systemic adverse effects. A second dose in pre-exposed did not increase antibody levels. Smoking and comorbidities were associated with lower neutralization and antibody levels. Among fully vaccinated, 6.3% breakthroughs were detected up to 189 days post-vaccination. Among pre-exposed non-vaccinated, 90% were IgG seropositive more than 300 days post-infection. Interpretation Our data support administering a single-dose in pre-exposed healthy individuals. However, heterogeneity of responses suggests that personalized recommendations may be necessary depending on COVID-19 history and life-style. Higher mRNA-1273 immunogenicity would be beneficial for those expected to respond worse to vaccination. Persistence of antibody levels in pre-exposed unvaccinated indicates maintenance of immunity up to one year.","Moncunill, G.; Aguilar, R.; Ribes, M.; Ortega, N.; Rubio, R.; Salmeron, G.; Molina, M.

165341,Fiscal policy effectiveness and risks in the development of Azerbaijan’s economy during economic shock,2021,"A significant cause of morbidity in COVID-19 infected patients admitted to the hospital is a severe dysregulated inflammatory response characterized as a cytokine storm, a key component of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we have assembled a basic immune regulatory model from a list of 19 immune mediators with reported involvement in cytokine storm. Automated text-mining of over 2,500 full text journal publications using the MedScan natural language processing (NLP) engine identified 112 documented regulatory interactions coordinating the dynamic response of this network. This same text mining highlighted reported bi-directional associations between Coronavirus infection and a broad set of immune mediators producing a complex feedback pattern of host- pathogen interaction. Decisional logic parameters supporting the network's dynamic response were identified such that observed responses to SARS-CoV infection in an in vitro system of Calu3 human lung adenocarcinoma cells could be accurately predicted. Of the 19 competing models, 2 supported a dominant inactive immune resting state, with a predicted onset of cytokine storm in 63% and 26% of simulated infections respectively. Discrete event simulation based on the latter suggest that some repurposing strategies might outperform popular use of hydroxychloroquine as a companion to anti-viral therapy.","Morris, M.

Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2020",2021,"The Trinity River Authority (TRA) Construction Services group oversees $550 million in active construction projects. These projects are needed for a variety of critical reasons that include increase treatment capacity, improve energy efficiency, replace aging infrastructure, and increase pipeline capacity. None of these projects can be delayed by any significant length of time, as they are all needed to be in service to prevent future failures and minimize down time to TRA customers. Failure of service is not an option, 100% service and 100% of the time is essential. TRA, like the rest of the world, had to learn of the threats that the COVID-19 pandemic presented to TRA staff and the potential impacts the threats posed to completing construction projects. TRA had to react to the threats based on information that was available early on in March 2020 and prepare plans for staff and construction contractors based on the best available information. Plans are only as good as the people who execute them, and fortunately TRA staff along with the support of the engineering consulting and construction contractor communities worked together to adhere to the plans that TRA developed for our projects. The response plans were put in place early in the pandemic and updated frequently as more information was made available. Key takeaways from this experience are TRA continued to move forward with all construction projects using a modified routine for additional safety requirements;communicate frequently, with everyone on the project team both internal to the organization and with external contractors and consultants;be prepared to evolve work plans with changing national and local guidelines;and above all, do not panic, do not shutdown, do not hide in the office or at home;instead, get out in front of the unknowns and create a safe environment with a clear set of guidelines for staff to follow. Getting through a major event whether it is extreme flooding or a global pandemic requires leading from the front and relying on input from the team.

166210,Pandemic Policy in the Vaccine Era: The Long Haul Approach,2021,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are currently being tested in numerous clinical trials as potential cell therapies for the treatment of various diseases and due to their potential immunomodulatory, pro-angiogenic, and regenerative properties. However, variabilities in tissue sources, donors, and manufacturing processes and the lack of defined critical quality attributes (CQAs) and clinically relevant mechanism of action (MoA) pose significant challenges to identify MSC cell therapy products with a predictable therapeutic outcome. This also hinders regulatory considerations and broad clinical translation of MSCs. MSC products are often administered to the patient immediately after thawing from cryopreserved vials (out-of-thaw). However, the qualifying quality-control assays are either performed before cryopreservation, or after culturing the post-thaw cells for 24-48 hours (culture-rescued), none of which represent the out-of-thaw product administered to patients. In this study, we performed a broad functional characterization of out-of-thaw and culture-rescue MSCs from bone marrow (BM-MSCs) and cord tissue (CT-MSCs) using macrophage activation and T cell proliferation-based in vitro potency assays and deep phenotypic characterization using single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using this data, we developed unbiased computational models, specifically symbolic regression (SR) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) models to predict the immunomodulatory potency of MSCs. Overall, our results suggest that manufacturing conditions (OOT vs. CR) have a strong effect on MSC-function on MSC interactions with macrophages and T cells. Furthermore, single-cell RNA-seq analyses of out-of-thaw BM and CT-MSCs indicate a tissue of origin-dependent variability and heterogeneity in the transcriptome profile. Using symbolic regression modeling we identified specific single-cell transcriptomic attributes of MSCs that predict their immunomodulatory potency. In addition, CCA modeling predicted MSC donors with high or low immunomodulatory potency from their transcriptome profiles. Taken together, our results provide a broad framework for identifying predictive CQAs of MSCs that could ultimately help in better understanding of their MOAs and improved reproducibility and manufacturing control of MSCs.","Pradhan, Pallab; Chatterjee, Paramita; Stevens, Hazel Y.; Glen, Chad; Medrano-Trochez, Camila; Jimenez, Angela; Kippner, Linda; Seeto, Wen Jun; Li, Ye; Gibson, Greg; Kurtzberg, Joanne; Kontanchek, Theresa; Yeago, Carolyn; Roy, Krishnendu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.12.294850,427

Apps with security provisions are able to provide confidentiality through end-to-end encryption. Ill-intentioned individuals and groups use these security services to their advantage by using the apps for criminal, illicit, or fraudulent activities. During an investigation, the provision of end-to-end encryption in apps increases the complexity for digital forensics investigators. This study aims to provide a network forensic strategy to identify the potential artifacts from the encrypted network traffic of the prominent social messenger app Signal (on Android version 9). The analysis of the installed app was conducted over fully encrypted network traffic. By adopting the proposed strategy, the forensic investigator can easily detect encrypted traffic activities such as chatting, media messages, audio, and video calls by looking at the payload patterns. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the trace files can help to create a list of chat servers and IP addresses of involved parties in the events. As a result, the proposed strategy significantly facilitates extraction of the app’s behavior from encrypted network traffic which can then be used as supportive evidence for forensic investigation. © 2021 by the authors.

Previous reviews have not clearly distinguished the context of mask use. Methods The review was completed within two weeks, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines where possible. The review looks at the effect of face coverings (surgical masks or cloth coverings, excluding FFP2 and FFP3 masks) in protecting against the transmission in droplet-mediated respiratory tract infections. Our review includes controlled trials or previous systematic reviews of mask use by the general public in public spaces, outside homes and healthcare facilities. Results The systematic literature search identified five randomized trials. Use of masks prevented infections in one subgroup of one pilot study, so the effect of face masks on the transmission of infections outside the home appears small or nonexistent. Five of the eight systematic reviews showed no evidence of face masks being helpful in controlling the spread of respiratory infection or preventing exposure in healthy individuals. Meta-analyses often combined very heterogeneous studies and costs were not reported in any studies. Conclusions Randomized studies on the effect of face coverings in the general population are few. The reported effect of masks used outside the home on transmission of droplet-mediated respiratory infections in the population is minimal or non-existent. It is difficult to distinguish the potential effect of masks from the effects of other protective measures.","Saijonkari, M.; Booth, N.; Isojarvi, J.; Finnila, J.; Makela, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248316v1?rss=1,427

However, extracting structure information from such data presents unique challenges. Here we introduce a set of computational tools for the systematic analysis of data from a wide variety of cross-link-ligation methods, specifically focusing on read mapping, alignment classification and clustering. We design a new strategy to map short reads with irregular gaps at high sensitivity and specificity. Analysis of previously published data reveals distinct properties and bias caused by the crosslinking reactions. We perform rigorous and exhaustive classification of alignments and discover 8 types of arrangements that provide distinct information on RNA structures and interactions. To deconvolve the dense and inter-twined gapped alignments, we develop a network/graph-based tool CRSSANT (Crosslinked RNA Secondary Structure Analysis using Network Techniques), which enables clustering of gapped alignments and discovery of new alternative and dynamic conformations. We discover that multiple crosslinking and ligation events can occur on the same RNA, generating multi-segment alignments to report complex high level RNA structures and multi-RNA interactions. We find that alignments with overlapped segments are produced from potential homodimers and develop a new method for their de novo identification. Analysis of overlapping alignments revealed potential new homodimers in cellular noncoding RNAs and RNA virus genomes in the Picornaviridae family. Together, this suite of computational tools enables rapid and efficient analysis of RNA structure and interaction data in living cells.","Zhang, Minjie; Fischer-Hwang, Irena T.; Li, Kongpan; Bai, Jianhui; Chen, Jian-Fu; Weissman, Tsachy; Zou, James Y.; Lu, Zhipeng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.01.454689,427

We sought to investigate the human atherosclerotic cellular environment using scRNA-seq to uncover potential therapeutic approaches. We aimed to make our workflow user-friendly, reproducible, and applicable to other disease-specific scRNA-seq datasets. Methods Here we incorporate automated cell labeling, pseudotemporal ordering, ligand-receptor evaluation, and drug-gene interaction analysis into an enhanced and reproducible scRNA-seq analysis workflow. Notably, we also developed an R Shiny based interactive web application to enable further exploration and analysis of the scRNA dataset. Results We applied this analysis workflow to a human coronary artery scRNA dataset and revealed distinct derivations of chondrocyte-like and fibroblast-like cells from smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and show the key changes in gene expression along their de-differentiation path. We highlighted several key ligand-receptor interactions within the atherosclerotic environment through functional expression profiling and revealed several attractive avenues for future pharmacological repurposing in precision medicine. Further, our interactive web application, PlaqView (www.plaqview.com), allows other researchers to easily explore this dataset and benchmark applicable scRNA-seq analysis tools without prior coding knowledge. Conclusions These results suggest novel effects of chemotherapeutics on the atherosclerotic cellular environment and provide future avenues of studies in precision medicine. This publicly available workflow will also allow for more systematic and user-friendly analysis of scRNA datasets in other disease and developmental systems.

Problematic media representations of racial and religious minorities persist in Australia and continue to shape public perceptions and political discourses on issues of migration and intercultural relations. This paper examines how Muslims and Africans are contemporary scapegoats of Australian anxieties. These fears continue to be present in racialized rhetoric and attacks on Chinese Australians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Applying discourse analysis on two recent case studies as illustrative examples – the 2018 Bourke Street attack and the so-called ‘African gangs’ – this paper argues that despite substantial research and critique, mainstream media continue to rely on familiar and problematic tropes for framing racial and religious minorities that dehumanize them based on essentialized characteristics of crime, violence and anti-social behaviour. These characteristics tend to be exploited for political gain, with Muslims and Africans portrayed as a disruption to social cohesion and national security. A critique of the role of media and political discourses is presented, as they remain critical instruments in the pursuit of a new ethics of openness, respect and mutual understanding, which are fundamental to living well with difference.","Weng, Enqi Mansouri Professor Fethi",Continuum,https://doi.org/10.1080/10304312.2021.1888881,427

Objectives: To analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the overall health and functioning in patients with axSpA. Methods: Data from axSpA patients participating in the first phase of the REUMAVID study were analysed. REUMAVID is a cross-sectional, observational study collecting data through an online questionnaire of unselected patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), recruited by patient organizations. The survey was disseminated during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (April-July 2020) in seven European countries (Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom). Patients with axSpA who completed the ASAS health index (ASAS-HI) questionnaire were included in this analysis. Descriptive analyses were used to present socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as daily habits. Overall health and functioning were defined according to the ASAS-HI (0-17), as follows: good health (ASAS-HI ≤5), acceptable health (ASAS-HI 6-11), and poor health (ASAS-HI ≥12). As secondary outcomes, well-being (WHO-5), self-perceived health status, and HADS for anxiety and depression were assessed. Results: Out of 670 axSpA patients, 587 (87.6%) completed ASAS-HI. Of these, 70.4% were female, 72.6% were married or in a relationship, 46.7% had university studies and 37.6% were currently employed. Mean age was 49.9±12.8 years and mean BMI was 26.7±5.5. Regarding extraarticular manifestations, 13.6% had psoriasis, 12.1% inflammatory bowel disease and 18.7% uveitis. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, 50.9% were receiving biological drugs, 46.3% NSAIDs, 26.4% painkillers, 24.7% conventional DMARDs, and 11.9% oral corticosteroids.

167850,Parting Thoughts III,2021,"Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, technology enthusiasts have pushed for digital contact tracing as a critical tool for breaking the COVID-19 transmission chains. Motivated by this push, many countries and companies have created apps that enable digital contact tracing with the goal to identify the chain of transmission from an infected individual to others and enable early quarantine. Digital contact tracing applications like AarogyaSetu in India, TraceTogether in Singapore, SwissCovid in Switzerland, and others have been downloaded hundreds of millions of times. Yet, this technology hasn't seen the impact that we envisioned at the start of the pandemic. Some countries have rolled back their apps, while others have seen low adoption. Therefore, it is prudent to ask what the technology landscape of contact-tracing looks like and what are the missing pieces. We attempt to undertake this task in this paper. We present a high-level review of technologies underlying digital contact tracing, a set of metrics that are important while evaluating different contact tracing technologies, and evaluate where the different technologies stand today on this set of metrics. Our hope is two-fold: (a) Future designers of contact tracing applications can use this review paper to understand the technology landscape, and (b) Researchers can identify and solve the missing pieces of this puzzle so that we are ready to face the rest of the COVID-19 pandemic and any future pandemics.

Less is known about the efficacy of other corticosteroids in severe COVID-19 patients. This study was designed to determine if longer and earlier corticoid therapy in severe COVID-19 patients is associated with reduced mortality and/or reduced rate of ICU admission for worsening of respiratory state. Methods: We performed a retrospective study with patients aged [≥] 18 years, with epidemiological and/or radiological suspected COVID-19, hospitalized in a regional hospital GHRMSA Mulhouse, France. Twenty-three patients received methylprednisolone (MP) as compassionate use, 1 mg/kg/day for seven days followed by prednisolone at a gradually reduced dosage, for 4 to 6 weeks. MP was started one week after COVID-19 symptoms first appeared. The primary composite outcome was mortality and/or ICU admission during hospitalisation. Results: Between March 14th to June 5th 2020, 255 patients were screened, 181 were included, and 92 were analysed, 23 patients treated with MP and 69 received standard care. SARS-CoV2 infection was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 82.3%. The overall composite outcome was higher in the control group: 42/69 patients (60.9%) versus 8/23 (34.8%) in the interventional group (p= 0.018). The correction of lymphopenia between days 1 to 7 was associated with better outcome (p=0.006).

Taquet, et al report that Fuhrer and Hanley are correct that the timing of COVID-19 and the control events differ and that, in turn, the duration of available follow-up differs between cohorts. They are also right that, as a result, there is a possible risk that the matching between cohorts might be partly lost at followup.

168133,Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Infection Control System for Covid-19-Like Pandemics using Blockchain,2021,"Background: Influenza virus and other respiratory viruses have been identified as an essential cause of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in children worldwide. However, there are few data on its frequency and clinical presentation in Jordan. Objectives: We aimed to identify the viral etiology of acute respiratory infections and the various clinical presentations in hospitalized children, especially those with influenza viruses compared to other respiratory viruses. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted at the Jordan University Hospital. All the positive nasopharyngeal aspirates that were collected from hospitalized children aged 0-19 years from January 2017 to January 2019 were reviewed. Results: A total of 338 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) with positive viral serology results were reviewed. Among the patients younger than four years, the RSV virus was the most frequently detected. However, the Influenza B virus was the most commonly seen in patients older than 5 years, H1N1 was more frequent in autumn (29.5%), and RSV was the most frequent virus in winter. Bronchopneumonia was the most frequent diagnosis among all hospitalized patients, followed by bronchiolitis. Out of 338 patients, 50.3% had tachypnea, 70.7% of patients were admitted to the pediatric floor, while 18.6% presented with a severe illness and required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Infants under the age of one were more likely to have higher co-infection rates with other viruses compared to children over five years that had influenza. Conclusion: Presentations of influenza and other respiratory viruses vary between different age groups, such as sepsis in children younger than one year.","Al-Iede, M.; Sarhan, L.; Abushanab, L.; Baniahmad, T.; Almiani, R.; Alyasi, A.; Khader, S.; Aleidi, S.

168219,Inequalities in air pollution exposure are increasing in the United States,2020-07-15,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has created pressure on the education system to find alternatives to face-to-face education. Consequently, teachers and students have used online teaching and learning on an unparalleled scale. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the Bahauddin Zakariy University (BZU) students' attitude toward learning and mainly examine the problems associated with taking online classes during COVID-19 in a developing country like Pakistan. The cross-sectional design was used to fulfill the study requirements. For the data collection, an online Google form was designed and circulated via a link to students enrolled in different programs at BZU. The result revealed that students have an enthusiastic attitude to using the online medium and would like to use online learning in the future or after the pandemic goes away. The highlighted issues include an inappropriate study environment, a disparity of gadget availability, inadequate online study content, no access or slow internet speed, and electricity load shedding. The above problems negatively affect students' studies in terms of minimum or no students' involvement and proxy attendance in the online class. In addition, the health of students is also reported as being seriously affected by attending online classes. Students had weak eyesight, increased weight, sleep deprivation, and behavioral problems. Overall, students showed a positive attitude and generous support from their teachers in the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, teachers play a fundamental role in helping students to make digital learning more valuable.","Mushtaque, Iqra Rizwan Muhammad Dasti Riaz Khan Ahmad Rashid Mushtaq Misbah",Performance Improvement,https://doi.org/10.1002/pfi.21982,427

In both models the infectivity of the asymptomatic period during the exposed stage of the disease will be taken into account. The different transmission rates of the SEIR models are calculated by considering the different locations and, more importantly, the lockdown measures implemented in each region. A new classification of these intervention measures will be set and their influence on the values of the transmission rates will be estimated through regression analysis.","Nistal, Raúl de la Sen Manuel Gabirondo Jon Alonso-Quesada Santiago Garrido Aitor J.; Garrido, Izaskun",Applied Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/app11146266,427
168441,Carry on remotely,2020,"The rise of fake news in the past decade has brought with it a host of consequences, from swaying opinions on elections to generating uncertainty during a pandemic. A majority of methods developed to combat disinformation either focus on fake news content or malicious actors who generate it. However, the virality of fake news is largely dependent upon the users who propagate it. A deeper understanding of these users can contribute to the development of a framework for identifying users who are likely to spread fake news. In this work, we study the characteristics and motivational factors of fake news spreaders on social media with input from psychological theories and behavioral studies. We then perform a series of experiments to determine if fake news spreaders can be found to exhibit different characteristics than other users. Further, we investigate our findings by testing whether the characteristics we observe amongst fake news spreaders in our experiments can be applied to the detection of fake news spreaders in a real social media environment.","Karami, Mansooreh; Nazer, Tahora H.; Liu, Huan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10942v1.pdf,427

Analog Gaming Communities in Lockdown,2020,"This chapter aims to know the psychosocial impact and social behaviours and related to the perception of technological needs in adults and older persons with diseases, health problems and/or sensory or motor disabilities. This work delves into this reality from a gender, inclusive and, at the same time, technological, biotechnological and/or virtual device approach. This goal includes two secondary objectives: 1) To know the health conditions that affect the adult and older people, whether they suffer from chronic diseases and health problems. In this way, it will be possible to understand if there are specific conditions in which the adult and older persons have felt especially sensitive during the pandemic outbreak in Spain. 2) To understand the needs of older people with sensory or motor disabilities before the pandemic and how this connects with the looking forward to an activity after COVID-19. One conclusion is that new emerging technologies are essential in aspects such as safety, hygiene and other social factors that help to improve autonomy and independence - such as canes and support devices in functional disability type EGARA - of older persons during and after the pandemic times. In addition to the needs of adults and the older persons prior to the pandemic, especially in older women, there are others that require research from a more inclusive and gender perspective. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Zorrilla-Muñoz, V.; Agulló-Tomás, M.

168738,Is Health Consciousness Important at the Time of Coronavirus? the Case of Slovakia and Hungary,2021,"IntroductionRisk perception of COVID-19 is potentially a significant determinant of the pandemic evolution and the public’s response to it. Acceptable levels of risk perception can be considered good for people to effectively fight the pandemic and adopt preventive health behaviors while high levels of risk perception may be damaging. Recently, Yıldırım&Güler (2020) developed the Covid-19 Perceived Risk Scale (C19PRS) to measure this construct.ObjectivesTo analyze the psychometric properties of the C19PRS Portuguese version, namely construct validity, internal consistency and convergent validity.MethodsA community sample of 234 adults (75.6% women;mean age= 29.53±12.51;range:16-71) completed an on-line survey with the Portuguese versions of the CPRS and the Fear of Covid-19 Scale (FCV-19S;Cabaços et al. 2020). The total sample was randomly divided in two sub-samples: sample A (n=117) was used to perform an exploratory factor analysis/EFA;sample B (n=117) to make a confirmatory factor analysis/CFA.ResultsEFA resulted in three components. CFA revealed that the second-order model with three factors presented good fit indexes (X2/df=1.471;CFI=.959;GFI=.948;TLI=.932;p[RMSEA≤.01]=.065). CPRS Cronbach alphas was α=.687;for F1 Worry, F2 Susceptibility to Covid-19 and F3 Susceptibility to Overall Morbimortality were α=.747, α=.813 and α=.543, respectively. The total and dimensional scores significantly correlated with FCV-19S (r>.30, p<.01).ConclusionsThis study provides evidence for the validity and reliability of the Portuguese version of CPRS, which will be used in an ongoing research project on the relationship between Covid-19 perceived risk, perfectionism, cognitive processes and adherence to public health measures to contain the pandemic.","Pereira, A.

168833,Threshold condition and non pharmaceutical interventions’s control strategies for elimination of COVID-19,2021-01-31,"According to a recent Deloitte study, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to place a huge strain on the global health care sector. Covid-19 has also catalysed digital transformation across the sector for improving operational efficiencies. As a result, the amount of digitally stored patient data such as discharge letters, scan images, test results or free text entries by doctors has grown significantly. In 2020, 2314 exabytes of medical data was generated globally. This medical data does not conform to a generic structure and is mostly in the form of unstructured digitally generated or scanned paper documents stored as part of a patient’s medical reports. This unstructured data is digitised using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process. A key challenge here is that the accuracy of the OCR process varies due to the inability of current OCR engines to correctly transcribe scanned or handwritten documents in which text may be skewed, obscured or illegible. This is compounded by the fact that processed text is comprised of specific medical terminologies that do not necessarily form part of general language lexicons. The proposed work uses a deep neural network based self-supervised pre-training technique: Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (RoBERTa) that can learn to predict hidden (masked) sections of text to fill in the gaps of non-transcribable parts of the documents being processed. Evaluating the proposed method on domain-specific datasets which include real medical documents, shows a significantly reduced word error rate demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.

168862,The global pandemic is accelerating housing crises,2021,"Tocilizumab is one of few treatments that have been shown to improve mortality in patients with COVID-19, but increased demand has led to relative global shortages. Recently, it has been suggested that lower doses, or fixed doses, of tocilizumab could be a potential solution to conserve the limited global supply while conferring equivalent therapeutic benefit to the dosing regimens studied in major trials. The relationship between tocilizumab dose, exposure, and response in COVID-19 has not been adequately characterized. There are a number of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters which likely differ between patients with severe COVID-19 and patients in whom tocilizumab was studied during the FDA approval process. Likewise, it is unclear whether a threshold exposure is necessary for tocilizumab efficacy. The safety and efficacy of fixed versus weight-based dosing of tocilizumab has been evaluated outside of COVID-19, but it is uncertain if these observations are generalizable to severe or critical COVID-19. In the current review, we consider the potential advantages and limitations of alternative tocilizumab dosing strategies. Leveraging PK models and simulation analyses, we demonstrate that a fixed single dose of tocilizumab 400 mg is unlikely to produce PK exposures equivalent to those achieved in the REMAP-CAP trial, though weight-stratified dosing appears to produce more uniform exposure distribution. Data from current and future trials could provide PK/PD insight to better inform dosing strategies at the bedside. Ultimately, rational dosing strategies that balance available limited supply with patient needs are required.","Leung, E.; Jorgensen, S. C. J.; Crass, R. L.; Raybardhan, S.; Langford, B.; Moore, W.

A rapid screening tool using this mutation is important for surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed and validated a single nucleotide polymorphism real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay using allelic discrimination of the spike gene N501Ymutation to screen for potential variants of concern and differentiate them from wild-type SARS-CoV-2. A total of 160 clinical specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 were characterized as mutant (N501Y) or wild-type by Sanger sequencing and were subsequently tested with the N501Y single nucleotide polymorphism real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. Our assay compared to sequencing, the gold standard for SNP detection and lineage identification, demonstrated clinical sensitivity of 100% for all 57 specimens displaying N501Y mutant, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing to be typed as A23063T, including one specimen with mixed signal for wildtype and mutant. Clinical specificity was 100% in all 103 specimens typed as wild-type, with A23063 identified as wild-type by Sanger sequencing. The identification of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages carrying an N501Y mutation is critical for surveillance purposes. Current identification methods rely primarily on Sanger sequencing or whole genome sequencing which are time-consuming, labor-intensive and costly. The assay described herein is an efficient tool for high-volume specimen screening for SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and for selecting specimens for confirmatory Sanger or whole genome sequencing.","Abdulnoor, M.; Eshaghi, A.; Perusini, S.

Because the virus behaves in ways that are novel, its current, short-term, and long-term health effects are only beginning to be discovered. This is also true of the social impact of the virus. Measures taken and measures not taken to restrict the spread of the virus have disparate effects on lower socioeconomic groups. Not only is the current pandemic highlighting stark social inequalities, it is also illuminating numerous problems in social infrastructure. Galtung’s notion of structural violence (1969) provides an ideal framework for which to examine the global pandemic, its politicization, and the social impact of each on citizens.

In collaboration with GDPH and the Georgia Center for Oncology Research and Education (Georgia CORE), the goal of the program has been to reduce disparities among high-risk minority and underserved women. The objective of this study is to report the 8-year surveillance data for women at increased risk for HBOC in statewide public health centers. The effect of the COVID pandemic on the program and sustainability is also reported. Methods: From 11/1/2012- 12/31/2020, the program provided education, outreach and collected surveillance data using an online genetics referral screening tool as recommended by USPSTF. Providers in 159 counties and health centers across Georgia were educated in cancer family history collection and appropriate referral to genetics. When an individual was found to be at high risk, she was referred to the Georgia CORE Genetics Advanced Practice Nurse for additional education, genetic testing and follow-up. Results: Online screenings attributable to GDPH totaled 29,087 with 1,656 positive screens. 28 % of clients were less than 25 years of age and 56 % ranged from 25-54. Race: 33 % white, 41 % black, 15 % Hispanic and 11 % other or N/A. 92 % of referrals were uninsured. Genetic testing was started or completed on 430 clients. 36 individuals declined testing after counseling (reconsideration, insurance, unknown reasons) and were provided with contact information. 47 (11%) pathogenic, clinically significant mutations were identified including 37 (79 %) HBOC related mutations and 10 (21 %) Lynch related mutations. Variants of uncertain significance were identified in 90 (21 %) clients, with multiple variants in 40 of those. 27 clients have been served through GDPH for physician consultation and surveillance. 13 were referred to area resources: one diagnosed with cancer, and 7 chose referral to other health care providers. Because of the pandemic, the program transitioned to telecommunications and remote access to testing in 5/2020. From 5/2020-12/2020, 34 clients completed testing (41% minority, all uninsured). 10 (29%) clinically significant mutations were identified and heightened surveillance initiated. Conclusions: The GDPH and Georgia CORE collaborative genomics program has served clients over the past 8 years, adjusting to changing resources while reaching a significant number of minority and underserved women.

169840,Are COVID-19 Data Reliable? A Quantitative Analysis of Pandemic Data from 182 Countries,2021,"The Association of Community Cancer Centers (ACCC) launched an initiative to improve care for patients with ovarian cancer (OVCA) in the United States. The project was designed to identify areas of greatest need for quality improvement (QI) initiatives aimed at improving OVCA care. A needs assessment survey and workshop application was designed by a multidisciplinary committee and was administered online using Qualtrics. A full day onsite workshop was conducted with the care teams at each site which included a lecture by an OVCA expert, a guided discussion to identify problems and barriers to optimal care delivery, and development of a problem statement for the resulting project. A 6-month QI project utilizing Plan-Do-Study-Act Cycles was developed by each site with data benchmarks. Project specific data was collected and analyzed. 26 programs submitted workshop applications. Program types varied, with the majority being Comprehensive Community Cancer Programs (n=6, 26.1%);Academic Comprehensive Cancer Programs (n=5, 21.7%);or NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Programs (n=5, 21.7%). The median number of annual OVCA patients diagnosed per site was 50.5 (range 22-190). The median numbers of clinical trials per site were 0 Phase I, 1.5 Phase II, and 2 Phase III. Eighty-five percent of sites reported having OVCA multidisciplinary care teams. Genetic testing and counseling (GTC) was the most frequently requested topic for QI (see Table). Three sites were chosen for QI projects. Site 1 chose to improve GTC rates for patients with newly diagnosed OVCA by implementing an electronic medical record (EMR) notification. During the 6-month project, receipt of any genetic testing within 60 days of an initial encounter improved from 68% to 77% of patients. Site 2 also chose to improve the receipt and efficiency of GTC through the development and application of an EMR smartset. During the QI period, GTC improved from 4/27 (15%) retrospectively to 14/14 (100%) with time from diagnosis to GTC decreasing from 1-8 months to 0.5-2 months. The QI project at Site 3 was to improve enrollment onto clinical trials though insertion of an EMR phrase in the template relating to clinical trial eligibility. No change in clinical trials enrollment was identified during the QI period which spanned the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. [Display omitted] Significant needs for the improvement of quality care delivery for patients with OVCA were identified across varied cancer care programs. Improved access to genetic testing and counseling was the most commonly identified need, followed by enhanced clinical trial enrollment. Using EMR tools, sites were able to rapidly increase rates of GTC. Increasing clinical trial enrollment using an EMR trigger was unsuccessful, largely due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing work to improve the implementation of best practices in OVCA treatment is needed.

It remains unclear whether these patients are at increased risk of developing more severe cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or not. Objectives: The objective of this descriptive study is to report the characteristics and outcomes of rheumatic patients that had a history of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Findings have also been compared to some of the existing publications on COVID-19 in these patients. Methods: Between November 17, 2020 and January 18, 2021, a single-centre observational study was conducted in the rheumatology department of the Emergency Clinical County Hospital and the University of Medicine and Pharmacy Iuliu Hatieganu in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The sample consisted of 62 rheumatic patients with a positive polymerase chain reaction test from nasopharyngeal/oral swab. Data on both systemic autoimmune disease and COVID-19 was collected using a survey, by means of telephone or in the outpatient clinic setting. Data on the patient rheumatologic condition was also collected from the electronic health records available within our department Results: 62 patients were included, with 85.48% females and 14.51% males, and a median age of 52 years (SD +/-14). The most frequent comorbidities were high blood pressure (HBP) 46.77%, dyslipidaemia 19.35%, liver disease 17.74%, and interstitial lung disease (ILD) 12.90%. Recurrent COVID-19 symptoms included: cough (62%), fever (46,77%), anosmia (46.77%), ageusia (30.64%), headache (29.03%), gastrointestinal symptoms (27.41%) and myalgia (25.80%). Out of the entire 62 sample, 41 patients had an inflammatory arthritis (IA) diagnosis, with the most frequent being rheumatoid arthritis (RA) -68.29%, followed by ankylosing spondylitis -21.95%, psoriatic arthritis -7.31% and 2.43% with Still disease. Only 10 patients suffered from connective tissue disease (CTD): 3 systemic lupus erythematosus, 2 poli/dermatomyositis, 2 Sjogren syndrome (SjS), 2 mixed connective tissue disease, 1 systemic sclerosis (SSc). Another 10 patients had overlapping syndromes with the most frequent (40%) overlap between RA and SSc. One patient had osteoarthritis. 49 patients followed a treatment with conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs with 51.2% of them being treated with Methotrexate. 14 of our patients received glucocorticoids (GC), but no relation between the GC dose and COVID-19 severity could be observed. Only 3 patients with doses greater than 10mg/day were present in the cohort and 2 developed mild while 1 developed an asymptomatic COVID-19 course. 22 patients had received biological treatment. Anti TNF alpha medication was administered to 13 of these, and mostly consisted of Adalimumab, Etanercept and Golimumab. The anti TNF alpha patients were asymptomatic or had mild forms of COVID-19 (93.30%). 8 cases had ILD: 3 RA patients, 3 overlapping syndromes, 1 SSc and 1 SjS. The median age was 59,5 years (SD +/-10). 25% exhibited severe, 37,5% moderate, 25% mild and 12.5% asymptomatic COVID-19. The COVID-19 severity in our sample was as follows: 12.90% of the patients were asymptomatic, 59.67% exhibited a mild form, 19.35% a moderate one, and out of the 8.06% with a severe case of COVID-19, 1 patient died. The median age in the severe cases of COVID-19 was 66 years (SD +/-12) and HBP was the most common comorbidity. Conclusion: Most patients in this sample were either asymptomatic or had a mild COVID-19 evolution. Although the research design has multiple limitations, rheumatic pathology does not seem to be a higher risk factor for severe COVID-19 than other associated comorbidities. With that in mind, ILD patients should be closely monitored as even in on our limited sample size a worse evolution of COVID-19 has been observed. Biological treatments, especially anti TNF alpha might help in reducing the severity of COVID-19, but this outcome could have been associated in our sample with other factors like lower media age and less comorbidities.","Halbac, A.; Balan, B.; Tamas, C.; Tamas, M.

170516,International marketing studies in banking and finance: a comprehensive review and integrative framework,2021,"More than 2 million SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been generated and shared since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and constitute a vital information source that informs outbreak control, disease surveillance, and public health policy. The Pango dynamic nomenclature is a popular system for classifying and naming genetically-distinct lineages of SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern, and is based on the analysis of complete or near-complete virus genomes. However, for several reasons, nucleotide sequences may be generated that cover only the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2. It is therefore important to understand how much information about Pango lineage status is contained in spike-only nucleotide sequences. Here we explore how Pango lineages might be reliably designated and assigned to spike-only nucleotide sequences. We survey the genetic diversity of such sequences, and investigate the information they contain about Pango lineage status. Although many lineages, including the main variants of concern, can be identified clearly using spike-only sequences, some spike-only sequences are shared among tens or hundreds of Pango lineages. To facilitate the classification of SARS-CoV-2 lineages using subgenomic sequences we introduce the notion of designating such sequences to a “lineage set”, which represents the range of Pango lineages that are consistent with the observed mutations in a given spike sequence. These data provide a foundation for the development of software tools that can assign newly-generated spike nucleotide sequences to Pango lineage sets.","O’Toole, Áine; Pybus, Oliver G.; Abram, Michael E.; Kelly, Elizabeth J.; Rambaut, Andrew",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.10.455799,427

A major limitation in defining mechanisms of disease has been the availability of tissue samples collected in early life, as well as technologies that permit deep immune analysis from limited sample volumes. In this work, we developed new experimental methods and applied unsupervised analytical tools to profile the local (bronchoalveolar lavage) and systemic (whole blood) immune response in childhood respiratory disease. We quantified and comprehensively phenotyped immune cell populations across blood and lung compartments in young children (under 6 years of age), showed that inflammatory cells in the BAL express higher levels of activation and migration markers relative to their systemic counterparts, and applied new analytical tools to reveal novel tissue-resident macrophage and infiltrating monocyte populations in the paediatric lung. To our knowledge, this is the first description of the use of these methods for paediatric respiratory samples. Combined with matched analysis of the systemic immune cell profile, the application of these pipelines will increase our understanding of childhood lung disease with potential to identify clinically relevant disease biomarkers.","Shanthikumar, Shivanthan; Ranganathan, Sarath C.; Saffery, Richard; Neeland, Melanie R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.21.436363,427

It helps mitigate liquidity problems but on the other hand, acts as a curse in propagating systemic risk at times of distress. Thus, as banks cannot function in isolation, this study uses the Contemporary Theory of Networks to examine banking competition in India for five distinct economic phases, emphasizing upon the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This paper proposes a Market Power Network Index (MPNI), which uses network parameters to measure banks' market power. This network structure shows a formation of bank clusters that are involved in competition. Specifically, network properties, such as centroid, average path length, the distance of a node from the centroid, the total number of connections in the inter-bank market, and network density, do go on to explain banking competition. It is interesting to note that crisis periods witness a lower level of competition, with GFC bearing the least competition. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic shows a lower trend, but it is of a higher magnitude than GFC. It was also found that big-sized, profitable, capital adequate, and public banks dominate the banking system. Notably, this study was conducted on a sample of 33 listed Indian banks from April 2008 to December 2020.","Rahman, M. R.; Misra, A. K.",J. Risk Financ.

Product impact may fall under the categories of economic, environmental or social impact, with the last category defined as the effect of a product on the day-to-day life of people. Design teams lack sufficient tools to estimate the social impact of products, and the combined impacts of economic, environmental and social impacts for the products they are designing. This paper aims to provide a framework for the estimation of product impact during product design. To estimate product impact, models of both the product and society are required. This framework integrates models of the product, scenario, society and impact into an agent-based model to estimate product impact. Although this paper demonstrates the framework using only social impact, the framework can also be applied to economic or environmental impacts individually or all three concurrently. Agent-based modelling has been used previously for product adoption models, but it has not been extended to estimate product impact. Having tools for impact estimation allows for optimising the product design parameters to increase the potential positive impact and reduce potential negative impact.","Mabey, Christopher S.; Armstrong, Andrew G.; Mattson, Christopher A.; Salmon, John L.; Hatch, Nile W.; Dahlin, Eric C.",Design Science,https://doi.org/10.1017/dsj.2021.16,427

This has led to social media becoming a significant source of new information for many people and unfortunately this phenomenon has given birth to a lot of misinformation, chaos and fear in people’s minds. This fear is often due to the inadequate and wrong information. Therefore, there is a important need to understand this crisis. Patterns need to be established between popular tweets and its effect on the public’s sentiments, especially their fear. So, tweets of three different countries namely United States of America, Federative Republic of Brazil and Republic of India. Sentiment analysis reveals that fear of this unknown and mysterious nature of the coronavirus is dominant among the public. Predominant analysis of tweets within past two months will be done and then a model will be built to predict future reaction of the general public based on the crisis level in the country. Machine Learning algorithms such as ‘Logistic Regression (LR)’, ‘Multinomial Naïve Bayes’ and ‘Support Vector Machine (SVM)’are used for classification purpose preceded by the pre-processing steps of raw data from each country. 90% of accuracy has been achieved from sentiment classification result.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided a powerful means to identify loci and genes contributing to disease risk, but in many cases the related cell types/states through which genes confer disease risk remain unknown. Deciphering such relationships is important both for our understanding of disease, and for developing therapeutic interventions. Here, we introduce a framework for integrating single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), epigenomic maps and GWAS summary statistics to infer the underlying cell types and processes by which genetic variants influence disease. We analyzed 1.6 million scRNA-seq profiles from 209 individuals spanning 11 tissue types and 6 disease conditions, and constructed gene programs capturing cell types, disease progression in cell types, and cellular processes both within and across cell types. We evaluated these gene programs for disease enrichment by transforming them to SNP annotations with tissue-specific epigenomic maps and computing enrichment scores across 60 diseases and complex traits (average N=297K). The inferred disease enrichments recapitulated known biology and highlighted novel relationships for different conditions, including GABAergic neurons in major depressive disorder (MDD), disease progression programs in M cells in ulcerative colitis, and a disease-specific complement cascade process in multiple sclerosis. Our framework provides a powerful approach for identifying the cell types and cellular processes by which genetic variants influence disease.","Jagadeesh, Karthik A.; Dey, Kushal K.; Montoro, Daniel T.; Gazal, Steven; Engreitz, Jesse M.; Xavier, Ramnik J.; Price, Alkes L.; Regev, Aviv",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.19.436212,427

Human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) are highly permissive to ZIKV infection, causing inhibition of cell proliferation concomitant with an induction of cell death. We previously demonstrated that pharmaceutical-grade heparin inhibited virus-induced cell death with minor effects on in vitro virus replication in ZIKV-infected hNPCs. Here we show that heparin prevented ZIKV-induced intracellular vacuoles, a signature characteristic of paraptosis, but also inhibited necrosis and apoptosis of hNPCs when grown as neurospheres (NS). Furthermore, heparin preserved the differentiation of both ZIKV-infected human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) derived-NPCs and fetus-derived NPCs into neural-glial cells.

If studies face delays or barriers to being published, the useful information they contain may not reach decision-makers in a timely manner. This represents a potential problem for mission-oriented disciplines where access to the latest data is paramount to ensure effective actions are deployed. We sought to analyse the severity of publication delay in conservation science — a field that requires urgent action to prevent the loss of biodiversity. We used the Conservation Evidence database to assess the length of publication delay (time from finishing data collection to publication) in the literature that tests the effectiveness of conservation interventions. From 7,415 peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed studies of conservation interventions published over eleven decades, we find that the mean publication delay (time from completing data collection to publication) was 3.6 years and varied by conservation subject — a smaller delay was observed for studies focussed on the management of captive animals. Publication delay was significantly smaller for studies in the non-journal literature (typically non-peer-reviewed) compared to studies published in scientific journals. Although we found publication delay has marginally increased over time (1912-2020), this change was weak post-1980s. Publication delay also varied inconsistently between studies on species with different IUCN Red List statuses and there was little evidence that studies on more threatened species were subject to a smaller delay. We discuss the possible drivers of publication delay and present suggestions for scientists, funders, publishers, and practitioners to reduce the time taken to publish studies. Although our recommendations are aimed at conservation science, they are highly relevant to other mission-driven disciplines where the rapid dissemination of scientific findings is important.","Christie, Alec P.; White, Thomas B.; Martin, Philip; Petrovan, Silviu O.; Bladon, Andrew J.; Bowkett, Andrew E.; Littlewood, Nick A.; Mupepele, Anne-Christine; Rocha, Ricardo; Sainsbury, Katherine A.; Smith, Rebecca K.; Taylor, Nigel G.; Sutherland, William J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.30.437223,427
172425,The Future of Nursing 2020-2030 Report:: Next Steps for Nurse Leaders,2021,"Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health departments have issued guidelines to limit viral transmission. In this environment, people will feel urges to engage in activities that violate these guidelines, but research on guideline adherence has been reliant on surveys asking people to self-report their typical behaviour, which may fail to capture these urges as they unfold. Guideline adherence could be improved through behaviour change interventions, but considering the wide range of behaviours that COVID-19 guidelines prescribe, few methods allow observing changes of aggregate guideline adherence in the wild. Methods To administer interventions and to obtain contemporaneous data on a wide range of behaviours, we use ecological momentary assessment. In this preregistered parallel randomised trial, 95 participants aged 18-65 from the UK were assigned to three conditions using blinded block randomisation, and engage in episodic future thinking (n = 33), compassion exercises (n = 31), or a sham procedure (n = 31) and report regularly on the intensity of their occurrent urges (min. 1, max. 10) and their ability to control them. We investigate whether state impulsivity and vaccine attitudes predict guideline adherence while assessing through which mechanism these predictors affect behaviour. Results We found that episodic future thinking (b = -1.60) and compassion exercises (b = -1.40) reduce the intensity of urges. State impulsivity is associated with stronger urges, but we found no evidence that vaccine hesitancy predicts lesser self-control. Conclusions We conclude that episodic future thinking exercises and compassion training may be used to stimulate compliance of individuals who are a risk for the community, such as those in voluntary self-isolation.","van Baal, S.

To provide an answer, the present Article discusses and categorizes the individual elements of territoriality in the EU’s architecture. The influence of EU law on national territorial rule on the one hand and the emergence of territorial governance elements at the European level on the other provide the main pillars of the inquiry. Once combined, these features not only help to improve our understanding of the EU’s distinctly supranational conception of territoriality. What is more, the discussion raises several important legitimacy questions.

However, there are multiple, alternative ways to conceptualize NbS across those three spheres.To inform the NbS discourses in research, policy and practice, we critically reflect on the prevailing framing of NbS. Although the concept links environmental health to human well‐being, we argue that its current dominant framing reinforces a dichotomy between people and nature by highlighting one, external nature working for the benefit of society. For the NbS concept to support transformation, we believe it must embody a reframing of human–nature relationships towards regenerative relationships between humans and nature.To support the transformative aspirations of NbS, we propose a novel core framing of NbS making explicit the co‐dependence of people and nature, which underpins human well‐being and environmental health. We highlight how such a framing can support a transformation through influencing beliefs and normative values, and second, through the communication and application of the NbS concept in research, policy and practice.We then elaborate on how such a framing is key to support inclusivity and collaboration between diverse research perspectives, policy objectives across scales and implementation practices to deliver just and successful NbS.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.","Welden, E.

Three independent GPs interpreted the vignettes to arrive at a Gold Standard consisting of 3 dispositions and divided into one of three categories of triage urgency: (1) emergency care required, (2) primary care required and (3) self-care. Main outcome measures Six professional non-medical and lay inputters simulated 2774 standardized patient evaluations using 3 online symptom checkers (OSC). We recorded when OSC provided a triage recommendation and whether it correctly recommended the appropriate triage recommendation across three categories of triage urgency (emergency care, primary care or self-care). We collected data on whether the solution appeared within the first 3 dispositions in each of the standards across 2774 standardized patient evaluations. Results When benchmarked against the Gold Standard, Healthily provided an appropriate triage recommendation 61.9% of the time compared to 45.3% and 42.4% of the time for Babylon and Ada respectively. There was poor agreement between OSC consultation outcome and Gold Standard dispositions. When compared to the Gold Standard, Healthily gave an unsafe under-triage recommendation 28.6% of the time overall across the three categories compared to 43.3% for Ada and 47.5% for Babylon (P<0.001). Conclusions OSCs recommended very unsafe triages only <4% of the time suggesting that the online consultation tools are generally working at a safe level of risk. Primary care vignettes are a helpful tool to support development of OSC, but not ideally suited to benchmark the performance of different OSC.

The Desirability of Insect Nutrition for Food Security of a World Heritage Site and Biosphere Reserve,2021,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is endemic in developed countries and is one of the most common causes of cardiometabolic diseases in overweight/obese individuals. While liver biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the current gold standard to diagnose NAFLD, the former is prone to bleeding and the latter is costly. We hereby demonstrated liver electrical impedance tomography (EIT) as a non-invasive and portable detection method for fatty infiltrate. We enrolled 19 subjects (15 females and 4 males; 27 to 74 years old) to undergo liver MRI scans, followed by EIT measurements via a multi-electrode array. The liver MRI scans provided subject-specific a priori knowledge of the liver boundary conditions for segmentation and EIT reconstruction, and the 3-D multi-echo MRI data quantified liver proton-density fat fraction (PDFF%) as a recognized reference standard for validating liver fat infiltrate. Using acquired voltage data and the reconstruction algorithm for the EIT imaging, we computed the absolute conductivity distribution of abdomen in 2-D. Correlation analyses were performed to compare the individual EIT conductivity vs. MRI PDFF with their demographics in terms of gender, BMI (kg·m−2), age (years), waist circumference (cm), height (cm), and weight (kg). Our results indicate that EIT conductivity (S·m−1) and liver MRI for PDFF were not correlated with the demographics, whereas the decrease in EIT conductivity was correlated with the increase in MRI PDFF (R = − 0.69, p= 0.003).

174476,Challenges and opportunities in accessing mobile phone data for COVID-19 response in developing countries,2021,"With sequencing as a standard frontline protocol to identify emerging viruses such zika virus and SARS-CoV2, direct utilization of sequence data to program antivirals against the viruses could accelerate drug development to treat their infections. CRISPR-Cas effectors are promising candidates that could be programmed to inactivate viral genetic material based on sequence data but several challenges such as delivery and design of effective crRNA need to be addressed to realize practical use. Here, we showed that virus-like particle (VLP) could deliver PspCas13b-crRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) in nanomolar range to efficiently suppress dengue virus infection in primary human target cells. Shortening spacer length could significantly enhance RNA-targeting efficiency of PspCas13b in mammalian cells compared to the natural length of 30 nucleotides without compromising multiplex targeting by a crRNA array. Our results demonstrate the potentials of applying PspCas13b RNP to suppress RNA virus infection, with implications in targeting host RNA as well.","Singsuksawat, Ekapot; Onnome, Suppachoke; Posiri, Pratsaneeyaporn; Suphatrakul, Amporn; Srisuk, Nittaya; Nantachokchawapan, Rapirat; Praneechit, Hansa; Sae-kow, Chutimon; Chidpratum, Pala; Hongeng, Suradej; Avirutnan, Panisadee; Duangjinda, Thaneeya; Siridechadilok, Bunpote",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.17.100388,427

This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted between 18 and 29 May 2020, with the participation of 506 students. The data were collected using a Personal Information Form, the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). It was found that the participants had a mean total IUS-12 score of 37.18±10.10. When the subscales of DASS-21 were examined, the participants’ mean scores were found to be 13.20±5.87 for the ‘depression’ sub-scale, 10.76±3.94 for the ‘anxiety’ sub-scale and 14.21±5.90 for the ‘stress’ sub-scale. It was ascertained that there were statistically significant differences in the mean scores obtained by the participants in the overall IUS-12 and DASS-21 sub-scales on the basis of the variables of ‘the nursing students’ academic achievements’ and ‘how the nursing students felt during the COVID-19 pandemic’ (p<0.05). It was discerned that there was a weak positive statistically significant relationship between the mean scores obtained in the overall IUS-12 and those obtained in the DASS-21 sub-scales (p<0.01). As the nursing students’ intolerance of uncertainty increased, their depression, anxiety and stress levels also went up.

174617,Interval temporal random forests with an application to COVID-19 diagnosis,2021,"Objective: We conducted a survey to understand the challenges faced by the staff of residential aged care facilities (RACF), during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background: In the current pandemic, the RACF workforce has been required to work under stressful conditions, with immense mental and physical pressures, resulting in anxiety and stress felt towards their jobs. Study design and methods: We electronically surveyed both clinical and non-clinical staff at public and private RACFs in Australia in June and August 2020. The survey asked a mix of openended and closed questions about preparedness for the pandemic, information flow, experience with personal protective equipment (PPE), management of suspected COVID cases, restrictions on visitors, and impact on RACF staff personal and home life. Quantitative data were analysed in SPSS;qualitative data using content analysis. Results: We received 371 responses: 198 from clinical staff and 168 from non-clinical staff. Respondents were between 20-71 years old, and 87% were female most commonly from Victoria (28%) or New South Wales (28%). The majority (80%) felt that Australian RACFs were well-prepared for the pandemic and 87% agreed that relevant healthcare authorities were contactable for information needed. A total of 37% reported challenges in estimating and ordering appropriate quantities of protective equipment. Ninety percent of facilities reported screening residents for possible symptoms and 77% introduced precautions or quarantine measures to protect residents. Most participants (98%) reported their RACF implemented restrictions on visitor access and 43% reported unfair or abusive treatment by family or friends of the residents. Commonly reported personal impacts included: workload increase, stress, emotional toll, family issues and fatigue. Support from colleagues as well as training, de-brief sessions and frequent meetings were identified as helpful facilitators during this time. Conclusion: We identified a wide range of practices and coping strategies among Australian RACFs. Whilst a majority of respondents reported coping well, a large proportion reported struggling both mentally and physically. Factors reported as helpful by the respondents may assist RACFs in planning for future pandemics. Implications for research, policy and practice: Understanding the challenges faced by all levels of staff within RACFs may aid decision-makers on a range of different levels - researchers, aged care providers, local/regional/state health departments and national leaders within government to help inform the development of interventions that may help the sector to recover, as well as prepare for potential future outbreaks. Of particular importance, are interventions or initiatives that focus on supporting the physical and mental health of staff i.e. those that prevent or minimise worker fatigue, emotional burnout and stress. What is already known about the topic? Nursing staff in Australian RACFs did not feel prepared for the COVID outbreak in their workplace. Early in 2020, RACF nurses experienced a greater overall workload and some had their staff hours reduced by their employers due to financial constraints caused by the outbreak. What this paper adds This paper offers a comprehensive insight into how RACF staff coped both individually and as part of the facility overall during the COVID crisis. It identified that a commonly reported source of stress was first-hand verbal abuse from family or friends of residents in response to visitor and lockdown restrictions implemented by the authorities. The paper highlighted that whilst the majority of respondents felt that RACFs were well prepared for managing residents during the pandemic, some facilities experienced significant problems with workloads, PPE and human resourcing. Furthermore, the survey showed that on an individual level, some staff experienced significant mental and physical stress during the outbreak.","Krzyzaniak, N.; Scott, A.

174716,Impact of Coronavirus Pandemic on Financial Market Stability in Africa,2021,"Pandemic and infectious disease outbreaks put pressure on health authorities and require lockdowns. These outbreaks, which strain limited healthcare resources, must be swiftly controlled and monitored. A large number of healthcare authorities are currently investigating automated systems to support outbreak monitoring and control. However, current contact tracing systems face many privacy, participation, and power constraints. Furthermore, elderly or less financially able individuals often cannot participate in automated contact tracing due to not owning a smartphone. This paper proposes a new system that enables health authorities to track exposure among individuals participating in the automated system, aid health authorities in interviewing non-participating individuals, and minimize the processing required by offloading to nearby edge computing devices. The proposed system utilizes edge servers to assist health authorities in tracking users who withdraw from or are unable to use contact tracing. Edge computing devices have access to more contextual information, resulting in minimal data collection and thus enabling businesses, houses, and offices to participate in contact tracing as locations. Edge computing devices enable location-based data collection of contact tracing data using proximity-based sensors for offices, homes, and shops, thereby assisting health authorities to notify users of exposure without disclosing the identities of businesses or individuals. Moreover, the proposed system reduces the overall power for end users up to 97% by delegating contact tracing to nearby edge computing devices. In addition, the system mitigates data poisoning attacks that target individualsx2019;smartphones, edge devices, or cloud servers by utilizing blockchain to store contacts, delegations, and identities.

174864,Simulating the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions limiting transmission in COVID-19 epidemics using a membrane computing model,2021-07-06,"This study presents a new algorithm for group decision-making solutions using Pythagorean Fuzzy Soft Matrices(PFSMs) and confident weight is given by experts. Pythagorean Fuzzy Set(PFS) is a generalization of the intuitionistic fuzzy set(IFS). Therefore, in real-life problems for uncertainty, the decision-making mechanism in PFSs outcomes better than IFS decision-making. Pythagorean Fuzzy Soft Set(PFSS) is deriving from the combination of PFS and Soft Set. PFSM is also the matrix representation of PFSSs. Based on the cardinalities of the PFSS, experts have been given a new method that assigns confident weight. Confident weight is given according to the experience and knowledge of each expert. For this process, the choice matrix and the combined choice matrix are created first. PFSMs and choice matrices given for each expert are multiplied and the matrices obtained are summed. Pythagorean distance measurements were used to check the accuracy of the results obtained by applying the algorithm. A medical case was studied to see if the proposed method for group decision-making is feasible. In the section of medical case, infectious diseases that were common before COVID-19 were selected. The newly given algorithm was applied to the opinions of physicians about these diseases. According to the Hamming Distance values, the results of three out of four physicians are the same;In the values obtained with Euclidean distance, it was seen that the opinions of all physicians were the same. It has been revealed that the newly proposed algorithm has increased the reliability of the results from the group decision analysis.","Kirisci, Murat Simsek Necip",Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksuci.2021.08.010,427

Political identity, education and other demographic variables explain only part of the differences between people in their susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation. This paper focuses on another explanation: epistemic vice. Epistemic vices are character traits that interfere with acquiring, maintaining, and transmitting knowledge. If the basic assumption of vice epistemology is right, then people with epistemic vices such as indifference to the truth or rigidity in their belief structures will tend to be more susceptible to believing COVID-19 misinformation. We carried out an observational study (US adult sample, n = 998) in which we measured the level of epistemic vice of participants using a novel Epistemic Vice Scale that captures features of the current competing analyses of epistemic vice in the literature. We also asked participants questions eliciting the extent to which they subscribe to myths and misinformation about COVID-19. We find overwhelming evidence to the effect that epistemic vice is associated with susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation. In fact, the association turns out to be stronger than with political identity, educational attainment, scores on the Cognitive Reflection Test, personality, dogmatism, and need for closure. We conclude that this offers evidence in favor of the empirical presuppositions of vice epistemology. © The Author(s), 2021.

In the Republic of Korea, the relatively successful management of the pandemic allowed borders to remain open, nor have any national lockdowns been incurred to date, making student mobility possible throughout the pandemic. This case study reports the arrival and quarantine experiences of 10 exchange students at a university in Seoul, Korea. Findings from interviews revealed eight major themes: (a) commitment to conducting the exchange, (b) re-appropriation of time and funds, (c) confusion, disorientation, and frustration, (d) inadequate preparation and misinformation, (e) mutual support and co-quarantining, (f) inaccessibility to local services, (g) dependence on local altruism, and (h) view of Korea as a responsible and safe country. Students’ views and expectations of Korea as a safe study destination amid the pandemic were juxtaposed with decidedly difficult and tumultuous arrival experiences.

Based on the digital literacy framework by Martin and Grudziecki (2006), a study was developed aiming to identify university students' digital competences, as well as the uses and effects of digital literacy in the development of personal and social skills. Data collection, using an online questionnaire, took place during the initial closing period of HEIs in Portugal. The results point to an almost widespread mastery of search and data editing skills and to a lesser ability to create and develop new digital solutions. Most students reported that digital technologies were used (before the crisis)] mainly for institutional communication and between peers, but not for the development of networking and lifelong learning skills. The lack of involvement of many teachers in the available pedagogical support is an obstacle to an adequate digital transformation in higher education, both in times of crisis and in the future. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

175919,Impacts of Lockdown Policies on International Trade,2021,"Background: Reports suggested cancer patients were at greater risk for increased morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. A process to mitigate these risks was established at Levine Cancer Institute (LCI) in partnership with Atrium Health's (AH) Hospital at Home (HAH) initiative. This virtual health navigation process employed expertise from the departments of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Oncology, and Supportive Oncology, including a specialized nurse navigation team, to rapidly identify COVID-19 positive LCI patients, monitor them under physician supervision, and escalate care as needed with AH HAH program. Methods: AH Information Services created an automated list of LCI COVID-19 positive patients with a daily database. Each patient was reviewed by a nurse navigator. Review included hematologic or oncologic diagnosis, outpatient or inpatient status, and any COVID-19 symptoms. Once a malignant diagnosis was confirmed, a diagnosis-specific navigator contacted and screened the patient with a COVID assessment tool. Documentation was forwarded to the primary oncologist/hematologist. The tool scored patients for surveillance and treatment needs. A score of 0-2 prompted phone assessment every 48-72 hours, and score of 3-5 required every 24-48 hour calls with physician involvement when appropriate. If score of ≥6, care was escalated to LCI nurse/physician for admission to AH acute care HAH or conventional inpatient admission. Results: From inception on 3/20/2020 to data review date of 12/2/2020, 974 LCI patients were identified as COVID-19 positive and reviewed for nurse navigation (Table). Of the 974, 488 were navigated. Given limited resources, patients with benign conditions were not assigned a navigator, though a similar process was created for sickle cell disease. Of the 974, 75 are now deceased. Only 25 are deceased among the 488 navigated. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented circumstances to our patients and their clinicians. LCI expeditiously put policies and procedures in place to mitigate the intersection of COVID-19 and cancer. The multidisciplinary response strategy liaising between AH HAH and LCI followed, assessed, and assisted LCI COVID19 positive patients. With our embedded nurse navigation team's specialized attention along with enhanced physician oversight and close collaboration with AH HAH, opportunities for care escalation or adjustments in cancerfocused care were promptly identified. Analysis is ongoing to elucidate the lower mortality rate observed among navigated patients.","Ragon, B. K.; Sumrall, A. L.; Blackley, K.; Osunkwo, I.; Moyo, T.

175930,"A progress report on planetary health, environmental and sustainability education in physiotherapy – Editorial",2021,"Background. COVID certification has been introduced, yet there are no empirical evaluations of its impact on vaccine uptake. Methods. Mirroring an RCT, we designed a synthetic control model comparing six countries (Denmark, Israel, Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland) that introduced certification (May-August 2021), with 20 control countries. Our estimates provide a counterfactual trend estimating what would have happened in virtually identical circumstances if certificates were not introduced. The primary outcome was daily COVID-19 vaccine doses, with supplementary analyses of COVID-19 infections. Findings. COVID-19 certification led to increased vaccinations 20 days prior to implementation, with a lasting effect up to 40 days after. Countries with lower than average pre-intervention uptake had a more pronounced increase. In France, doses exceeded 25,895 vaccines per million capita (pmc) or in absolute terms, 1,749,589 doses prior to certification and 11,434 pmc after (772,563 doses). There was no effect in countries with higher uptake (Germany) or when introduced during limited supply (Denmark). There was higher uptake for <20 years and 20-29 years. Access restrictions linked to certain settings (nightclubs, events >1,000) were associated with higher uptake <20 years. When extended to broader settings, uptake remained high in the youngest group, but also observed in older age groups. The relationship of the intervention with reported infections was difficult to assess based on available data. Interpretation. We provide the first empirical assessment of the relationship between COVID-19 certification and vaccine uptake. Interpretation should recognise additional factors, including age eligibility changes and pandemic trajectories. We provide evidence that certification could increase vaccine uptake.

175949,A New Vision for Europe’s Bioeconomy in a Post-COVID World: Research and Regulation,2021,"Background: TG-1701 is a selective, covalent BTK inhibitor administered once daily (QD). Both the 'U2' combination (anti-CD20 mAb ublituximab + the PI3Kδ-CK1ϵ inhibitor umbralisib) and BTK inhibition are highly active in treatment-naïve (TN) and relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL, each having previously demonstrated superiority over standard chemoimmunotherapy. Here we report the results of the dose escalation of TG-1701 monotherapy and TG-1701+U2. Methods: Pts with R/R CLL and lymphoma were enrolled in a Ph 1 study initially evaluating dose escalation (DE) of oral TG-1701 QD continuously administered in 28-day cycles (100, 200, 300, and 400 mg). After characterizing the safety profile of TG-1701 monotherapy, we implemented a parallel DE arm of TG-1701+U2. Select dose levels of TG-1701 monotherapy were expanded in CLL, MCL and Waldenström's (WM). All pts were treated until disease progression. The primary objectives are to characterize the safety profile and define the recommended Ph 2 doses for the drugs alone and in combination. Results: As of 03 February 2021, 123 pts were treated with TG-1701: 25 in the monotherapy DE arm, 61 in the 200 mg disease-specific cohorts (20 CLL [5 TN], 21 MCL [4 TN], 20 WM [8 TN]), 20 in the 300 mg CLL cohort (4 TN), and 17 in the 1701+U2 DE arm. The median # of prior therapies was 1 (range, 1 -10). All pts were BTKi-naïve. All 123 pts were evaluable for safety. TG-1701 was well tolerated and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for monotherapy was not reached at 400 mg (demonstrating near 100% saturation of the BTK at all dose levels studied). Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) of clinical interest included atrial fibrillation (AF 4.0% of pts, G ≥3 in 1 case), G ≥3 hypertension (2.4%), and bleeding events (18.7%, all G1-2). No cases of ventricular tachyarrhythmia were reported. TEAEs leading to TG-1701 dose reduction occurred in 6.5% of pts. TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 1.6% of pts (AF, COVID-19). At the data cut-off, 119 pts were evaluable for response, including 40 in DE (Table). The median duration of response has not been reached among responders overall. The median follow-up (mFU range) was 15.9 mos (1.3 -28.6+) in DE and 8.5 mos (1.4 -15.6+) in disease-specific cohorts. Conclusions: TG1701 exhibits an encouraging safety and efficacy profile. The combination of 1701+U2 has been well tolerated and dose escalation continues. The combination shows enhanced depth of response over TG-1701 monotherapy. Recruitment to this study continues.

This study estimates progress and gaps in reaching the UNAIDS 2020 target of 90% KOS, and the efficiency of HIV testing services (HTS) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where two thirds of all PLHIV live. Methods: We used data from 183 population-based surveys (N=2.7 million participants) and national HTS programs (N=315 country-years) from 40 countries as inputs into a mathematical model to examine trends in KOS among PLHIV, median time from HIV infection to diagnosis, HIV testing positivity, and proportion of new diagnoses among all positive tests, adjusting for retesting. Findings: Across SSA, KOS steadily increased from 6% (95% credible interval [95%CrI]: 5% to 7%) in 2000 to 84% (95%CrI: 82% to 86%) in 2020. Twelve countries and one region, Southern Africa, reached the 90% target. In 2020, KOS was lower among men (79%) than women (87%) across SSA. PLHIV aged 15-24 years were the least likely to know their status (65%), but the largest gap in terms of absolute numbers was among men aged 35-49 years, with over 700,000 left undiagnosed. As KOS increased from 2000 to 2020, the median time to diagnosis decreased from 10 to 3 years, HIV testing positivity declined from 9% to 3%, and the proportion of first-time diagnoses among all positive tests dropped from 89% to 42%. Interpretation: On the path towards the next UNAIDS target of 95% diagnostic coverage by 2030, and in a context of declining positivity and yield of first-time diagnoses, we need to focus on addressing disparities in KOS. Increasing KOS and treatment coverage among older men could be critical to reduce HIV incidence among women in SSA, and by extension, reducing mother-to-child transmission.","Giguere, K.; Eaton, J.

Methods: In this study, we propose CovRNN, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models to predict COVID-19 patients' outcomes, using their available electronic health record (EHR) data on admission, without the need for specific feature selection or missing data imputation. CovRNN is designed to predict three outcomes: in-hospital mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and long length of stay (LOS >7 days). Predictions are made for time-to-event risk scores (survival prediction) and all-time risk scores (binary prediction). Our models were trained and validated using heterogeneous and de-identified data of 247,960 COVID-19 patients from 87 healthcare systems, derived from the Cerner(R) Real-World Dataset (CRWD). External validation was performed using three test sets (approximately 53,000 patients). Further, the transferability of CovRNN was validated using 36,140 de-identified patients' data derived from the Optum(R) de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record v.1015 dataset (2007-2020). Findings: CovRNN shows higher performance than do traditional models. It achieved an area under the receiving operating characteristic (AUROC) of 93% for mortality and mechanical ventilation predictions on the CRWD test set (vs. 91.5% and 90% for light gradient boost machine (LGBM) and logistic regression (LR), respectively) and 86.5% for prediction of LOS > 7 days (vs. 81.7% and 80% for LGBM and LR, respectively). For survival prediction, CovRNN achieved a C-index of 86% for mortality and 92.6% for mechanical ventilation. External validation confirmed AUROCs in similar ranges. Interpretation: Trained on a large heterogeneous real-world dataset, our CovRNN model showed high prediction accuracy, good calibration, and transferability through consistently good performance on multiple external datasets. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a COVID-19 predictive model that delivers high accuracy without the need for complex feature engineering.","Rasmy, L.; Nigo, M.; Kannadath, B.

176568,Ordered Variables and Their Concomitants under Extropy via COVID-19 Data Application,2021,"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore the inter-linkages of mindfulness, remote engagement and employee morale as a solution to new normal, during the turbulent times of the pandemic.Design/methodology/approachRemote engagement is the biggest challenge that is faced by many organisations with their employees working remotely. This paper examines the relevance of mindfulness amidst all distractions that obstruct the employees to stay focussed in their work assignments while performing remotely. Therefore, a thorough literature survey has been made to analyse the conceptual relationship among mindfulness, remote engagement and employee morale. Based on the conceptual analysis, a set of possible frameworks linking the three constructs has been stated for future research.FindingsThis conceptual paper has come up with few possible frameworks to model the assertions by investigating and corroborating it with quantitative or qualitative studies by the future researchers.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper has tried to advocate the linkage of the three constructs, which is the need of the hour for setting the organisation to the new normal way of work.Practical implicationsThe current paper suggests that the organisations can deal with the toughest challenge of engaging people remotely by practising mindfulness technique, and thereby, it would result in high morale leading to improved performance. This approach paves the way for leading a “new normal” even post-pandemic.Originality/valueDue to the prevalence of the unforeseen situation of pandemic, organisations have no other way but to resort to remote work. Through the practice of mindfulness, the engagement of employees can be adhered to an extent, which results in enhanced employee morale, which can help the organisation to achieve its business objectives amidst this turbulent time and gradually resorts to function in the new normal.","Pattnaik, Laxmiprada Lalatendu Kesari Jena",International Journal of Organizational Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijoa-06-2020-2267,427

(Special Section: Pandemics and sustainability.),2020,"This paper aims to develop a rapid assessment of the COVID-19 impact on the Galician (NW Spain) seafood sector, one of the most important maritime regions in the world. Here, we focus not only on the immediate COVID-19 impacts on the extractive fisheries sector, but also on the capacity of the aquaculture and the canned industries to supply seafood markets before and during the pandemic. We synthesize multiple data sources from across the seafood supply chain to show the relative initial responses and variables of recovery during a pre-COVID-19 period (2015-2019) and during the pandemic (2020). Our study shows that seafood sectors and trade were disrupted by abrupt shifts in demand, supply and limitations on the movement of people and goods, with a wide range of impacts and consequences for the seafood sectors. We find that domestic landings, Galician aquaculture production and imports and exports of seafood products (fresh, live and frozen) in 2020 showed an important decrease. In contrast, the canned production and the imports and exports of prepared and preserved seafood products followed an increasing trend during the COVID-19 pandemic. We record a change in the consumption behavior of the Galician population, which significantly increased expenditure in fresh and canned seafood products during the first confinement. Overall, the Galician seafood sectors were able to ensure the supply of seafood products to the population during the period of confinement decreed as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. Proximity to markets, investment in domestic or nearby supply chains and the development of new technological innovations helped to avoid food shortages and loss of livelihoods in Galicia. Fishers and fishing enterprises have also acted collectively to reassert their rights to provide essential and high quality seafood products to the Galician population, their livelihoods and safe working conditions, and have leveraged relationships and collaborations with their government counterparts to continue fishing.","Villasante, Sebastian Tubío Ana Ainsworth Gillian Pita Pablo Antelo Manel Da-Rocha José María",Frontiers in Marine Science,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.737395,427
176798,Graph representation forecasting of patient's medical conditions: towards a digital twin,2020-09-20,"The article investigates the role of new digital technologies during a crisis period on the example of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the methods used by different states to prevent the spread of the virus and its consequences, the author analyzes the advantages of the impelled rapid digitalization, scrutinizes its negative aspects, and discusses perspectives. Although the digital transformation had already been taking place before the pandemic actually started (2019), the current crisis facilitates the unprecedented digitalization breakthrough in all life spheres, which will have delayed consequences. The short-run effects are already obvious: deepening of virtual communication;advancement of electronic document flow systems and online-services (including E-Government, public health service, etc.);virtualization of education, culture, sports, leisure activities;transformation of labour market towards distance employment, an outburst of electronic commerce and services, robot automation in economy;virtualization of political life (online-meetings, online-debates, online-summits, etc.), and, moreover, a transfer of power struggle and geopolitical struggle itself to digital platforms. Greater convenience and effectiveness are the most vivid advantages of digital technologies development, which plays the key role in crisis periods. Better access of disabled persons and people living in geographically remote places to medical aid, education, cultural objects, etc. also belongs to important achievements of the rapid digitalization. At the same time, there are significant negative aspects of this process, both general and specific. The violation of democratic rights and freedoms (primarily, of personal data security and individual privacy) is unavoidable in the light of the necessary ""digital control"" from the state to contain the spread of infection. Private IT companies participating in the process of the virus spread control due to their products (mobile applications, Internet platforms, etc.) also benefit from access to personal data. Whereas this issue is not central in authoritarian regimes like China, it becomes very challenging for democratic societies of the West. The digitalization of services gives wide room for irregularities and fraud in general. A growing ""digital exclusion"" is another concern: the greater dependency on technical means excludes certain parts of the population unable to use them for different reasons. An increasing individualization and solitude amid the lacking real-life communication gives rise to complicated psychological issues and mental disorders. Among specific negative side-effects of digitalization there are obstacles in personal electronic verification, worsening in the quality of remote medical assistance and online-education, unemployment growth and smashup of offline-businesses in economy, and some other. The most complicated question of the current crisis and the next ""post-COVID"" period is how serious the above-mentioned negative consequences of the rapid digitalization will be, to what extent they may devaluate its advantages, what sacrifice will be made by humanity to pay for comfort and effectiveness.","Rovinskaya, T.

176890,BIALL Covid-19 Industry Survey 2020: an Introduction,2021,"Purpose: To deal with the present situation and recover after the COVID-19 pandemic, construction firms are required to recognise the trends in construction supply chain management (CSCM) for the upcoming years and determine the appropriate practices towards the trends for the improvement of construction activities in terms of strategy, tactic and operations. This paper aims to recognise key trends in CSCM and uses these trends as strategic criteria for the evaluation and prioritisation of lean construction (LC) tools at different project phases including design and architectural engineering, planning and control, on-site construction and safety management. Design/methodology/approach: The integrated analytic hierarchy process–Delphi method is used to collect and analyse the data from construction experts to evaluate the importance levels of the CSCM trends and recommend the appropriate tools for LC practices to improve project performances. Findings: Seven key CSCM trends are identified: lean supply chain management (SCM), supply chain (SC) integration, SC standardisation, SC problem-solving, SC information-sharing, SC flexibility and SC sustainability. Based on these trends, a set of prioritised lean tools are suggested for LC practices, in which “virtual design construction” (VDC) and “last planner system” are considered as the central tools. These two LC practices can be integrated with other effective tools to support the strategic, tactical and operational targets in construction supply chain (CSC) projects. Research limitations/implications: This study gives the managerial implications by developing an application framework of LC practices for CSC projects. The framework promotes “VDC” as a strategic tool for the phase of design and architectural engineering and considers “last planner system” as the central LC practice for the phase of project planning and control. The framework also focuses on the improvement of efficiency in construction operations by taking into account the aspects of on-site collaboration, problem-solving, improvement and safety. Originality/value: Up to date, there is still a lack of researches in classifying and prioritising the significant LC tools for each project phase to deal with CSC issues in both breadth and depth. Thus, this study is performed to provide construction managers with the awareness of CSCM trends on which they can focus to have strategic criteria for selecting LC practices to improve CSC performances. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Le, P.

177346,United States,2021,"Saliou (Eur J Epidemiol, 1994, 10 (4), 515-517) argued that pandemics are special kinds of crises and requires the public health sector to focus on: 1) reducing uncertainty, 2) rumor mitigation, and 3) ensuring the public reduces their risk of contracting the disease. With this as a backdrop, the central aim of this research is to better understand the connections between public information seeking, evaluation, and self-protective behaviors in the COVID-19 pandemic and focuses on a comparison between the Republic of Korea and Vietnam to provide insights into the influence of the individual, institutional, and information factors influencing people's experience with COVID-19. Thus, there are two major contributions of this study. First, it provides a cross-theory evaluation of the factors that contribute to information seeking, evaluation, and self-protective behaviors. Second, the study identifies potentially critical differences in information seeking, evaluation, and self-protective behaviors based on acute disease reproduction in countries with a successful pandemic suppression history. Findings suggest that in countries where there are high levels of trust and satisfaction even small changes in the infection rates lead to different information seeking and self-protective behaviors.","Diers-Lawson, A.; Johnson, S.; Clayton, T.; Kimoto, R.; Tran, B.

In March 2020, due to the Covid-19 crisis, Hearings underwent one of the most significant changes since their inception: proceedings shifted to an online conferencing platform (“virtual hearings”), and some procedural modifications were introduced. In June 2020, we used an online survey to gather more than 270 responses from professionals, volunteers, young people, and families who had experience of virtual hearings. These responses highlight that while there are reasonable justifications for the use of virtual hearings, including the duty to ensure orders are appropriately reviewed and renewed, concerns related to children and young people’s right to participation, privacy and representation bring into question the extent to which children’s rights are realised in virtual Children’s Hearings. © Robert B.

177474,Assessing the environmental impacts of COVID-19;A review,2021,"Canada has a long history of assimilative efforts with respect to Indigenous peoples. Legal assimilation efforts occurred on two fronts: the voluntary and involuntary enfranchisement of First Nations people, and the dissolution of First Nations reserve lands. Cultural assimilation occurred through the residential school system, and the removal of Indigenous children from their homes by Canadian child welfare agencies in the “sixties scoop”. Another form of assimilation is through environmental assimilation. I define environmental assimilation as changes to the environment through development, to the extent whereby the environment can no longer support Indigenous cultural activities. Herein, I examine environmental assimilation in northern Ontario, Canada. The “taken-up” clause in Treaty No. 9, the “Exemption Orders” in the Far North Act, the “Except” stipulation in the Mining Amendment Act, and the unilateral streamlining of projects in the Green Energy Act and the COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act—these pieces of legislation pose threats to the environment and serve to facilitate the reality of contemporary environmental assimilation of First Nations.","Tsuji, Stephen R.

178039,Wenn Home-Office produktiver ist – wie wir in Zukunft arbeiten könnten,2021,"Fluorescence microscopy, which visualizes cellular components with fluorescent stains, is an invaluable method in image cytometry. From these images various cellular features can be extracted. Together these features form phenotypes that can be used to determine effective drug therapies, such as those based on nanomedicines. Unfortunately, fluorescence microscopy is time-consuming, expensive, labour intensive, and toxic to the cells. Bright-field images lack these downsides but also lack the clear contrast of the cellular components and hence are difficult to use for downstream analysis. Generating the fluorescence images directly from bright-field images would get the best of both worlds, but can be very challenging to do for poorly visible cellular structures in the bright-field images. To tackle this problem deep learning models were explored to learn the mapping between bright-field and fluorescence images to enable virtual staining for adipocyte cell images. The models were tailored for each imaging channel, paying particular attention to the various challenges in each case, and those with the highest fidelity in extracted cell-level features were selected. The solutions included utilizing privileged information for the nuclear channel, and using image gradient information and adversarial training for the lipids channel. The former resulted in better morphological and count features and the latter resulted in more faithfully captured defects in the lipids, which are key features required for downstream analysis of these channels.","Wieslander, Håkan; Gupta, Ankit; Bergman, Ebba; Hallström, Erik; Harrison, Philip J",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.18.427121,427
178251,"Ten minutes with James Mountford, Chief of Quality and Learning, NHS Nightingale Hospital London",2020,"This study investigated how Hong Kong’s community centers for older people faced challenges and delivered services amid the Covid-19 pandemic. According to experiences of 110 health and social care workers who completed an electronic questionnaire, the provision of center-based services of most respondents were severely affected. Some of them launched online services but faced various constraints such as staff members’ limited knowledge, insufficient technical support and service users’ lacking required devices and poor internet connection. Hong Kong’s experience shows that digital literacy needs to be embedded into the future health and social care training curriculum. Also, effective digital communication training packages need to be developed with the involvement of service users. Moreover, innovative approaches have become imperative for health and social care practitioners to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. Future studies can investigate the impact of Covid-19 from the perspective of older respondents and on various types of social services. Also, qualitative research methods can be adopted to collect rich data for deeper understandings on the difficulties of both service providers and users on delivering and receiving internet-based health and welfare services. In short, future studies can examine service users’ views on the impact of Covid-19 by using in-depth interviews.

Many COVID-19 vaccines have been developed with different efficacy and safety profiles. The current study aimed to investigate the short-term side effects associated with Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine among males and females who received the first dose. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at KAAUH between February 28 and March 12, 2021. The main outcomes were the reported side effects at days 1, 2, and 3 post-vaccination. The study included 528 participants, of whom 49.8% (n = 263) were males. The reported side effects among all participants during the first day included myalgia (49.8%), fever (42%), headache (40%), numbness (8.5%), eye muscle pain (6.3%), palpitations (4.7%), shortness of breath (4.4%), sore throat (4.2%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (4.2%). No anaphylaxis or thrombotic events were reported during the study period. There were statistically significant differences in the side effects reported (females vs males) during the first day, which included myalgia (63% vs 36.5%, p-value = 0.000), fever (51.7% vs 32.3%, p-value = 0.000), headache (55.5% vs 24.3%, p-value = 0.000), numbness (11.7% vs 5.3%, p-value = 0.009), sore throat (6.4% vs 1.9%, p-value = 0.009), eye muscle pain (9.4% vs 3%, p-value = 0.002), shortness of breath (7.5% vs 1.1%, p-value = 0.000), and palpitation (9.1% vs 0.4%, p-value = 0.000).

178881,A review on virtual clinical trials: The future,2021,"Background The SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 has spread worldwide and has been associated with increased risk of severe disease. Studies on patient trajectories and outcomes among hospitalised patients infected with B.1.1.7 are essential for hospital capacity planning. Methods Using linked individual-level data from national registries, we conducted a cohort study on cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Norway hospitalised between 21 December 2020 and 25 April 2021. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios using survival analysis to examine the association between B.1.1.7 and time from symptom onset to hospitalisation, and length of stay (LoS) in hospital and ICU compared to non-VOC. We calculated adjusted odds ratios using logistic regression to examine the association between B.1.1.7 and mortality (up to 30 days post discharge) compared to non-VOC. Results We included 946 B.1.1.7 patients and 157 non-VOC. The crude median time from symptom onset to hospitalisation was 8 days (IQR: 5-10) for B.1.1.7 and 8 days (IQR: 4-11) for non-VOC. The crude median LoS in hospital was 5.0 days (IQR: 2.6-10.0) for B.1.1.7 patients and 5.1 days (IQR: 2.5-9.9) for non-VOC. Fifty-four (6%) B.1.1.7 patients died, compared to 14 (9%) non-VOC. There was no difference in the unadjusted or adjusted estimates of our outcome measures for B.1.1.7 and non-VOC patients. Conclusions B.1.1.7 does not appear to influence hospitalised patient trajectories, compared to non-VOC. These findings, along with the success of ongoing vaccination programmes, are encouraging for ongoing capacity planning in the hospital sector.","Whittaker, R.; Brathen Kristofferson, A.; Seppala, E.; Valcarcel Salamanca, B.; Veneti, L.; Larsdatter Storm, M.; Boas, H.; Aasand, N.; Naseer, U.; Bragstad, K.; Hungnes, O.; Kvale, R.; Golestani, K.; Feruglio, S.; Vold, L.; Nygard, K.; Alnes Buanes, E.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.28.21259380v1?rss=1,427

179568,Forecasting COVID-19 Cases in Egypt Using ARIMA-Based Time-Series Analysis,2021,"COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV2 has spread rapidly across the world, resulting in many patients in need of intensive care support. Severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis/septic shock, and multi-organ failure may occur during the disease course among many other complications. There still is not a definite cure, but supportive care is important to minimize complications. Patients in need of respiratory support and interventions should preferably be placed in negative pressure isolation rooms, with utmost care to decrease viral spread. Points to consider during oxygen therapy, non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and shock management of COVID-19 patients are discussed. Patients with mild hypoxia may be managed with conventional oxygen therapy, while others will benefit from high flow nasal oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation. Although corticosteroids are not recommended for other viral pneumonia, there are recent reports suggesting that steroids may have a place in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with hypoxia. Shock may complicate the course of the disease and a search for the etiology of shock should be carefully planned. Thromboembolic events are common;prophylaxis and/or treatment of thromboembolic events should be managed according to the guidelines. Meanwhile, the results of ongoing randomized, controlled trials on antiviral and immunomodulatory agents are expected to offer better treatment options for COVID-19 patients in the near future.","Talan, L.; Altintaş, N.

Securities cross-holding is key for financial stability because of potential contagion arising from cyclical interdependencies in the connective architecture of financial systems. The presence of cyclical interdependencies is studied based on network analysis. The data set is a multilayer network that comprises bonds, certificates of deposit and equity issued and held by Colombian financial institutions from 2016 to 2019.FindingsResults show that the extent of securities’ cyclical interdependencies is particularly low and stable – even when cross-holding across different types of securities is considered.Research limitations/implicationsThe monetary value of exposures and their size with respect to financial institutions’ balance sheets are not considered. Studying the impact on the financial system’s solvency is a compulsory research path.Practical implicationsThe network topology suggests that increased potential contagion by cyclical interdependencies and feedback effects from securities cross-holding is rather limited.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that cyclical interdependencies arising from the securities cross-holding are studied.

In Israel, healthcare personnel (HCP) were initially prioritized for Covid-19 vaccination, creating an ideal setting to evaluate real-world VE in a closely monitored population. Methods We conducted a prospective study among HCP in 6 hospitals to estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants filled out weekly symptom questionnaires, provided weekly nasal specimens, and three serology samples - at enrollment, 30 days and 90 days. We estimated VE against PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection using the Cox Proportional Hazards model and against a combined PCR/serology endpoint using Fishers exact test. Findings Of the 1,567 HCP enrolled between December 27, 2020 and February 15, 2021, 1,250 previously uninfected participants were included in the primary analysis; 998 (79.8%) were vaccinated with their first dose prior to or at enrollment, all with Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. There were four PCR-positive events among vaccinated participants, and nine among unvaccinated participants. Adjusted two-dose VE against any PCR-confirmed infection was 94.5% (95% CI: 82.6%-98.2%); adjusted two-dose VE against a combined endpoint of PCR and seroconversion for a 60-day follow-up period was 94.5% (95% CI: 63.0%-99.0%). Five PCR-positive samples from study participants were sequenced; all were alpha variant. Interpretation Our prospective VE study of HCP in Israel with rigorous weekly surveillance found very high VE for two doses of Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 during a period of predominant alpha variant circulation.","Katz, M.

Dentistry is a profession where healthcare professionals are extremely susceptible of being infected as well as retain a high susceptibility to cross infect and transmit the contagious viral sickness among general public attending dental clinics. The grounded reality for an average dental practitioner is that walking back to operative clinical work in dentistry post-pandemic is quite tedious. Most of the safeguards and practices recommended in the current COVID-19 pandemic phase need significant alterations in the ways to practice clinical dentistry in terms of prevention and transmission of cross infection. 3D printing or additive manufacturing is the most upcoming surge of technology in the field of health care. Many novel research-driven and technology-based interventions from 3D printing technologies must be exploited and adapted to find ways and means to fight out the outburst of the pandemic.

Our aim was to elucidate the influence of non-pulmonary findings of thoracic computed tomography (CT) on unfavourable outcomes and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients based on a large patient sample. Methods : MEDLINE library, Cochrane and SCOPUS databases were screened for the associations between CT-defined features and mortality in COVID-19 patients up to June 2021. In total, 22 studies were suitable for the analysis and included into the present analysis. Overall, data regarding 4 extrapulmonary findings could be pooled: pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and coronary calcification. Results : The included studies comprised 7859 patients. The pooled odds ratios for the effect of the identified extrapulmonary findings on in-hospital mortality are as follows: pleural effusion, 4.76 [95% CI 2.97-7.62]; pericardial effusion, 1.21 [95% CI 0.74-1.98]; coronary calcification, 2.68 [95% CI 1.78-4.04]; mediastinal lymphadenopathy, 2.02 [95% CI 1.18-3.45].

181273,Cloud activation properties of aerosol particles in a continental Central European urban environment,2021,"The current study sought to measure how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the mental health and well-being of college students, particularly nontraditional students. Participants (n = 321) completed a series of surveys assessing their level of depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, insomnia, and well-being. Participants also indicated their nontraditional student characteristics, level of resilience, and additional life stressors due to the pandemic. Statistical analyses found that participants reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and insomnia, with corresponding lower levels of well-being across all students, compared with prepandemic levels. Results showed that while nontraditional students indicated an increased number of life stressors during the pandemic compared with their traditional peers, nontraditional students also demonstrated higher levels of resilience. Nontraditional students appear to be more successful at managing stressful life events due to the increased resilience that comes with age and experience, which can better prepare them to persevere and overcome challenges.

Greater engagement with race, class, ethnicity, age, and colonialism – amongst other factors – and their interactions with the politics of abortion, safety, reproduction and activism would have more fully demonstrated the potential of Reproductive Justice as both theory and praxis, lending further weight to the arguments of Bloomer etal.

The investigation is carried out using two historical datasets, namely WASK and SIX, which collect flows from edge nodes of two networks of different size. WASK is a novel dataset introduced and analyzed for the first time in this paper, while SIX is a well-known source of network flows. For the considered datasets, the paper proposes traffic modeling and prediction methods. For traffic modeling, the Fourier Transform is applied. For traffic prediction, two approaches are proposed—modeling-based (the forecasting model is generated based on historical traffic models) and machine learning-based (network traffic is handled as a data stream where chunk-based regression methods are applied for forecasting). Then, extensive simulations are performed to verify efficiency of the approaches and their comparison. The proposed modeling method revealed high efficiency especially for the SIX dataset, where the average error was lower than 0.1%. The efficiency of two forecasting approaches differs with datasets–modeling-based methods achieved lower errors for SIX while machine learning-based for WASK. The average prediction error for SIX reached 3.36% while forecasting for WASK turned out extremely challenging.","Knapińska, Aleksandra Włodarczyk Adam",Electronics,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics10141637,427
181811,Analysis of Decision Making of Energy Enterprises on Adaptive Behavior Amid COVID-19,2021,"There are two proven dietary approaches to shift type 2 diabetes (T2D) into remission: low energy diets (LED) and low carbohydrate diets (LCD). These approaches differ in their rationale and application yet both involve carbohydrate restriction, either as an explicit goal or as a consequence of reducing overall energy intake. The aims of this systematic review were to identify, characterise and compare existing clinical trials that utilised ""low carbohydrate"" interventions with differing energy intakes. Electronic databases CENTRAL, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE and Scopus were searched to identify controlled clinical trials in adults with T2D involving low carbohydrate intake (defined as <130g carbohydrate/day) and reporting weight and glycemic outcomes. The initial database search yielded 809 results, of which 18 studies met the inclusion criteria. 12/18 studies utilised low carbohydrate diets with moderate or unrestricted energy intake. Six trials utilised low energy diets (<1200kcal/day), with all except one incorporating meal-replacements as part of a commercial weight loss programme. Interventions using both restricted and unrestricted (ad libitum) energy intakes produced clinically significant weight loss and reduction in HbA1c at study end-points. Trials that restricted energy intake were not superior to those that allowed ad libitum low carbohydrate feeding at 12 and 24 months. An association was observed across studies between average weight loss and reduction in HbA1c, which strengthened with trial length, indicating that sustained weight loss is key to T2D remission. Further research is needed to specifically ascertain the weight-independent effects of carbohydrate restriction on glycemic control in T2D.","Nicholas, A.; Soto-Mota, A.; Lambert, H.; Collins, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.07.21256843v1?rss=1,427

182617,Limits of Restrictions of Human Rights and Freedoms to Ensure Security (problem Statement),2021,"Background: Antiandrogens were shown to be effective in mild-tomoderate COVID-19 male patients, supported by the SARS-CoV-2 dependency on transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which is solely modulated by androgens, for cell entry. While women with hyperandrogenism experiment more symptoms in COVID-19 compared to women without hyperandrogenism, and the chronic use of an antiandrogen seemed to mitigate these symptoms, whether the benefits would be observed in overall females is unknown. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of proxalutamide as a treatment for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in females. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm, parallel study on COVID-19 female outpatients, that compared the use of proxalutamide versus placebo. The primary outcome was hospitalization rates throughout 30 days after randomization. Patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 not hospitalized were recruited in two sites in Brasilia, Brazil, between January 4 and February 28, 2021, were randomized on a 2:3 ratio between proxalutamide and placebo, and were administered proxalutamide 200mg/day or placebo for seven days, in addition to usual care. Results: A total of 177 women were randomized, including 75 in the proxalutamide arm and 102 patients in the placebo arm. None of the patients lost follow-up or discontinued treatment. The 30-day hospitalization rate was 2.7% in the proxalutamide arm and 18.6% in the placebo arm (p<0.001), with a hospitalization risk ratio (RR) of 0.14 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.03-0.59]. Conclusions: These findings suggest that treatment of COVID-19 patients with proxalutamide in combination with standard of care was reduced hospitalization rate by 86% (p < 0.001), with no safety concerns.","Cadegiani, F.

Some of the primary symptoms are associated with acute respiratory disorders, namely, fever, cough, and shortness of breath. A person’s nutritional status affects the risk of infection and the clinical course of COVID-19. Knowledge is an important domain for the formation of a person’s behavior, because actions based on knowledge are more important than actions or behaviors that are not based on knowledge. AIM: This study aims to determine the relationship between the level of knowledge about COVID-19 and the balanced nutritional behavior of the people of Medan City. METHODS: This was a descriptive analytical study, with a cross-sectional research design. The study samples consisted of Medan City residents, who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria based on the convenient sampling method. The primary data in this study were drawn from a research questionnaire, which was filled out online. RESULTS: From 200 of the research samples analyzed, 88% had a good level of knowledge towards COVID-19, 59% had a good level of nutrition practices. There was no significant difference between mean score and results for knowledge of COVID-19 and nutritional practices based on certain demographic characteristics. The relationship analysis showed p = 0.22;prevalence ratio = 2.711;and confidence interval 95%= 1.123–6.541 with a correlation value of 0.161.

HiTs examine different approaches to the organization, financing and delivery of health services and the role of the main actors in health systems; describe the institutional framework, process, content and implementation of health and health care policies; and highlight challenges and areas that require more in-depth analysis. The Belgian population continues to enjoy good health and long life expectancy. This is partly due to good access to health services of high quality. Financing is based mostly on proportional social security contributions and progressive direct taxation. The compulsory health insurance is combined with a mostly private system of health care delivery, based on independent medical practice, free choice of physician and predominantly fee-for-service payment. This Belgian HiT profile (2010) presents the evolution of the health system since 2007, including detailed information on new policies. While no drastic reforms were undertaken during this period, policy-makers have pursued the goals of improving access to good quality of care while making the system sustainable. Reforms to increase the accessibility of the health system include measures to reduce the out-of-pocket payments of more vulnerable populations (low-income families and individuals as well as the chronically ill). Quality of care related reforms have included incentives to better integrate different levels of care and the establishment of information systems, among others. Additionally, several measures on pharmaceutical products have aimed to reduce costs for both the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (NIHDI) and patients, while maintaining the quality of care.","Gerkens, Sophie; Merkur, Sherry",Health systems in transition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21224177/,427

The ability of this family of positive strand RNA viruses to move between species and cause severe disease in humans, with the potential for pandemic spread, has been confirmed. METHODS An understanding of the disease and its pathogenesis and the genetics of coronavirus infections, as well as strategies to treat or prevent coronavirus infections, are essential. The history of coronavirus vaccines and the occurrence of laboratory-associated SARS-CoV infections underscore the need for stably attenuated strains of SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. RESULTS Rapid progress has been made in understanding the clinical disease of SARS in adults and children. In adults, systemic infection with clinical and biochemical abnormalities, as well as respiratory infection, may be the rule. SARS is much milder in children younger than 12 years old than it is in adolescents and adults. In children age 12 years and younger, symptoms are generally nonspecific and cold-like. Numerous approaches to the development of SARS-CoV vaccines have been undertaken, and there is evidence that antibodies to the spike protein may be protective from replication and pathology in animal models. CONCLUSIONS The availability of reverse genetic systems has made it possible to engineer and recover coronavirus variants that contain multiple genetically stable mutations that grow well in culture but are attenuated for replication, virulence or both. Such variants will be platforms for the safe growth of SARS-CoV and candidates for live attenuated vaccines.","Denison, Mark R",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15577575/,427

Using a fluorogenic substrate, it was found that the apical addition of I-432 could suppress trypsin-like activity in the supernatants of IPEC-J2 cells. The inhibition of TMPRSS2 did not affect physiologically produced hydrogen peroxide levels in the apical and in basolateral compartments. Loss of expression of the TMPRSS2 serine protease domain (28 kDa) was also observed when cells were pre-exposed to I-432. Partial decrease in immunofluorescent signal intensities derived from the altered distribution pattern of TMPRSS2 was detected after a 48 h long incubation of IPEC-J2 cells with the inhibitor indicating the efficacy of TMPRSS2 inhibition via I-432 administration in vitro.","Pászti-Gere, Erzsebet; Czimmermann, Eszter; Ujhelyi, Gabriella; Balla, Peter; Maiwald, Alexander; Steinmetzer, Torsten",Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27277342/,427

Serology testing seems to have a higher sensitivity than molecular diagnostics from 8 days after onset of symtoms, and should be part of risk assessment and epidemiological studies of COVID-19. The performance of commercial serological point-of-care (POC) lateral flow tests are highly manufacturer-dependant. Low sensitivity increases the risk of false negative results and could result in unnecessary quarantine of test persons with developed antibodies. Low specificity increases the risk of false positive results and could lead to false assumptions of immunity. Carefully selected serological POC tests for sars-cov-2 can be used in large scale testing but should only be used by licensed medical staff able to understand their limitations and interpret the results.","Stackelberg, Otto; Esmaeilzadeh, Mouna; Olsen, Björn; Lundkvist, Åke",Lakartidningen,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32463475/,427

Included in the talks were state-of-the-art presentations about infectious clone technology and recombinant viruses, pathogen and receptor interactions at the cellular and molecular level, genomic responses to infection, and new information on antiviral mechanisms of action. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and progress toward understanding the epidemic was addressed, and other sessions were presented concerning immune therapy and immunopotentiation of disease, siRNA and gene silencing, host responses to pathogen infections, as well as the use of genetic engineering to circumvent and direct the immune response. Many discussions were held and data were presented about possible compounds and new drugs that may have antiviral properties, yet there were few discussions of any available new drugs. This report addresses reverse genetics of SARS virus, as well as its epidemiology, and a host of different recent approaches to developing antivirals effective against SARS, including some potential vaccine candidates. Also presented are hypotheses about the human immune response to SARS infection, as well as immune therapies against botulinum and anthrax toxins. This report also addresses antiviral approaches exploiting siRNAs, and different aspects of the host immune response to many of the different dangerous pathogens discussed at this meeting. Finally, approaches to circumventing and directing the immune response using genetic engineering will be reported.","Shurtleff, Amy C",IDrugs : the investigational drugs journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15057645/,427

The transcription start site for the 1.45-kb sgRNA was previously mapped to position 2606 (J. C. Carrington, T. J. Morris, P. G. Stockley, and S. C. Harrison, (1987). J. Mol. Biol. 194, 265-276) corresponding to position 2607 in the TCVms isolate and the start site for the 1.7-kb sgRNA has now been mapped to position 2333 in TCVms. A 96-base sequence (90 bases upstream and 6 bases downstream) encompassing the transcription start site for the 1.45-kb sgRNA was sufficient for full promoter activity. Similarly, a 94-base sequence (90 bases upstream and 4 bases downstream) encompassing the start site was required for full activity of the 1.7-kb sgRNA promoter. The 1.45-kb sgRNA promoter, but not the 1.7-kb sgRNA promoter, was able to direct synthesis of a nontemplate RNA in vitro using partially purified TCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Computer generated secondary structures for the two sgRNA promoters revealed an extensive hairpin just upstream from the transcription start site. Comparisons of corresponding sequences from related viruses indicates higher sequence conservation for the 1.45-kb sgRNA promoter compared with the 1.7-kb sgRNA promoter, despite the latter's location within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase open reading frame.","Wang, J; Simon, A E",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9185601/,427

METHODS The clinical features of 35 patients with SARS in the past five months were retrospectively studied, and compared with 35 patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Consecutive blood samples from 13 patients with SARS and 10 healthy volunteers were collected. The CD+4 and CD+8 in T cell in peripheral blood were detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS The most common symptoms included fever (in 100.0 percent of the patients), cough (74.3 percent), headache (45.7 percent), myalgia (45.7 percent) and lymphopenia (20/33). Serial chest radiographs showed progressive multi-infiltration in the lung fields. The CD+4 and CD+8 in T cell in 13 patients with SARS significantly decreased [CD+4: (16.10+/-4.31) percent vs. (38.30+/-8.52) percent, t=8.174,P<0.01; CD+8: (19.90+/-5.40) percent vs. (28.38+/-4.33) percent, t=4.055, P<0.01]. The time of bringing down the fever and the time of absorption of pathological changes in SARS patients were prolonged than those of the pneumonia patients [the time of bringing down the fever (13.92+/-8.35) days vs. (3.86+/-1.42)days, t=16.490,P=0.000;the time of absorption of pathological changes: (11.97+/-4.41) days vs. (9.21+/-4.42) days, t=3.082,P=0.003]. CONCLUSION SARS is a serious respiratory illness, the most common symptoms are fever, cough, headache and myalgia, other common findings are lymphopenia, the CD+4 and CD+8 in T cell in peripheral blood decrease and multi-infiltrate through out the lung fields.","Luo, Xian-rong; Li, Zhuo-liang; Cheng, Tao; Wu, Wei-ling; Liu, Shu-ren; Xie, Qing",Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12919659/,427

200388,Probable forecasting of epidemic covid-19 in using cocude model,2021,"Murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus, initiates infection by binding to its cellular receptor (MHVR) via spike (S) proteins projecting from the virion membrane. The structures of these S proteins vary considerably among MHV strains, and this variation is generally considered to be important in determining the strain-specific pathologies of MHV infection, perhaps by affecting the interaction between MHV and the MHVR. To address the relationships between S variation and receptor binding, assays capable of measuring interactions between MHV and MHVR were developed. The assays made use of a novel soluble form of the MHVR, sMHVR-Ig, which comprised the virus-binding immunoglobulin-like domain of MHVR fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1. sMHVR-Ig was stably expressed as a disulfide-linked dimer in human 293 EBNA cells and was immobilized to Sepharose-protein G via the Fc domain. The resulting Sepharose beads were used to adsorb radiolabelled MHV particles. At 4 degrees C, the beads specifically adsorbed two prototype MHV strains, MHV JHM (strain 4) and a tissue culture-adapted mutant of MHV JHM, the JHMX strain. A shift to 37 degrees C resulted in elution of JHM but not JHMX. This in vitro observation of JHM (but not JHMX) elution from its receptor at 37 degrees C was paralleled by a corresponding 37 degrees C elution of receptor-associated JHM (but not JHMX) from tissue culture cells. The basis for this difference in maintenance of receptor association was correlated with a large deletion mutation present within the JHMX S protein, as sMHVR-Ig exhibited relatively thermostable binding to vaccinia virus-expressed S proteins containing the deletion. These results indicate that naturally occurring mutations in the coronavirus S protein affect the stability of the initial interaction with the host cell and thus contribute to the likelihood of successful infection by incoming virions. These changes in virus entry features may result in coronaviruses with novel pathogenic properties.","Gallagher, T M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9060676/,427
200389,Probable forecasting of epidemic covid-19 in using cocude model,2021,"Diarrhea is a serious problem in sheep and goat farming, causing great economic losses. Most viral and bacterial enteropathogens of diarrheic sheep and goats are considered foodborne pathogens with a potential to be zoonotic. The present study investigated the prevalence of some viral and bacterial enteropathogens in diarrheic sheep and goats between October 2015and February 2016 in Medina, Saudi Arabia. A total of 310 fecal samples were collected from diarrheic sheep (n=193) and goats (n=117). The samples were screened for the presence of rotavirus and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) using Sandwich (ELISA) technique. The bacterial enteropathogens were isolated and identified biochemically and the virulence factors of Escherichia coli were determined by using PCR. Escherichia coli was the most prevalent agent in both sheep and goats (34.7% and 30.7%, respectively). According to the expressed virulence genes, Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) was detect in 34.3% of sheep isolates and 30.6% of goats isolates. Salmonella species was isolated from 3.6% of sheep and 2.6% of goats. Klebsiella species was isolated from 1.6% of sheep but not from goats. Regarding viral agents, rotavirus was found in 31.6% of sheep and 27.4% of goats, while BCoV was detected in 19.6% of the sheep and 16.2% of the goats. The prevalence of bacterial and viral enteropathogens was significantly higher in the 0-12 months age group compared to the older age groups. Double infection was the most common (53.0%) infection pattern compared to single (37.5%) and triple (9.5%) infections. Rotavirus infection was significantly associated with ETEC infection. In conclusion, we report high prevalence of rotavirus and ETEC in sheep and goats, which are of veterinary and public health importance. This study provides valuable data on the prevalence of viral and bacterial enteropathogens in sheep and goats in Medina, Saudi Arabia that will be useful to develop control measures for these pathogens.","Shabana, I I; Bouqellah, N A; Zaraket, H",Tropical biomedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33592964/,427

Preliminary experiments suggest that fibritin is a trimer, and its predominant central part has a parallel alpha-helical coiled-coil structure. To investigate the oligomerization and function of fibritin, we have designed and studied two related deletion mutants, denoted M and E, that consist of its last 75 and 120 amino acids, respectively. Both proteins contain part of the coiled-coil region and the 29 amino acid carboxy-terminal domain essential for the trimerization of fibritin. The proteins are expressed as a soluble product in an Escherichia coli system. We have obtained crystals of fibritins M and E. Complete native X-ray diffraction data sets have been collected to 1.85 and 2.7 A resolution, respectively. The crystals have space group P3 with a=44.3 A, c=91.3 A (fibritin M) and R32 with a=41.2 A, b=358.7 A (fibritin E) in the hexagonal setting.

The intestinal contents were collected from 65 enteritis-affected flocks (cases) and tested by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Of these 65 cases, 35 (53.80%) were positive for a single virus and 26 (40.00%) for two viruses. The remaining four samples were negative for all three viruses tested. Of the 65 cases, 57 were positive for chicken astrovirus (CAstV) while 30 cases had avian nephritis virus (ANV). None of the cases were positive for orthoreovirus. Comparison of 12 CAstVs of this study with previously published CAstV sequences revealed nucleotide identities ranging from 73.20 to 98.00%. The nucleotide identities ranged between 83.10-95.50% when nine ANVs of this study were compared with previously reported ANV sequences. The amino acid sequences of CAstVs in comparison to previously published sequences revealed certain unique changes. Phylogeny based on polymerase gene revealed that CAstVs and ANVs of this study were under the same monophyletic clade. In conclusion, a large number of broiler chicken flocks experiencing enteritis were positive for CAstV and ANV by RT-PCR. The presence of more than one enteric virus in enteritis-affected flocks and changes at the genetic level in these viruses may affect the severity of disease.","Kaithal, B; Jindal, N; Kumar, P; Mor, S K",Acta virologica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27928915/,427

We describe the epidemiology and transmission characteristics of early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Bavaria, Germany. Cases were reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, reported from 20 January-19 March 2020. The incubation period was estimated using travel history and date of symptom onset. To estimate the serial interval, we identified pairs of index and secondary cases. By 19 March, 3546 cases were reported. A large proportion was exposed abroad (38%), causing further local transmission. Median incubation period of 256 cases with exposure abroad was 3.8 days (95%CI: 3.5-4.2). For 95% of infected individuals, symptom onset occurred within 10.3 days (95%CI: 9.1-11.8) after exposure. The median serial interval, using 53 pairs, was 3.5 days (95%CI: 3.0-4.2; mean: 3.9, s.d.: 2.2). Travellers returning to Germany had an important influence on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Bavaria in early 2020. Especially in times of low incidence, public health agencies should identify holiday destinations, and areas with ongoing local transmission, to monitor potential importation of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Travellers returning from areas with ongoing community transmission should be advised to quarantine to prevent re-introductions of COVID-19.","Böhm, S; Woudenberg, T; Chen, D; Marosevic, D V; Böhmer, M M; Hansen, L; Wallinga, J; Sing, A; Katz, K",Epidemiol Infect,,427

COVID-19 is most commonly transmitted through speech, coughing, sneezing, and salivary sputum. Because dental professionals work closely with the oral cavity, it is imperative that infection prevention controls are strictly adhered to. It is important that the dental profession treats patients while also limiting the possible contamination through the production of aerosol in the dental environment. Furthermore, the dental professional also has a key role in raising awareness and guidance amongst the population concerning COVID-19 related biosafety measures. This literature review aims to inform dental professionals about the COVID-19 pandemic and to present the implications of the virus to the dentist.

207937,SARS-COV-2 Presenting as New Onset Atrial Fibrillation: A Case Report,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns led to a sharp drop in socio-economic activities in China in 2020, including reductions in fossil fuel use, industry productions, and traffic volumes. The short-term impacts of lockdowns on China's air quality have been measured and reported, however, the changes in anthropogenic emissions have not yet been assessed quantitatively, which hinders our understanding of the causes of the air quality changes during COVID-19. Here, for the first time, we report the anthropogenic air pollutant emissions from mainland China by using a bottom-up approach based on the near-real-time data in 2020 and use the estimated emissions to simulate air quality changes with a chemical transport model. The COVID-19 lockdown was estimated to have reduced China's anthropogenic emissions substantially between January and March in 2020, with the largest reductions in February. Emissions of SO2, NOx, CO, non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), and primary PM2.5 were estimated to have decreased by 27ĝ€¯%, 36ĝ€¯%, 28ĝ€¯%, 31ĝ€¯%, and 24ĝ€¯%, respectively, in February 2020 compared to the same month in 2019. The reductions in anthropogenic emissions were dominated by the industry sector for SO2 and PM2.5 and were contributed to approximately equally by the industry and transportation sectors for NOx, CO, and NMVOCs. With the spread of coronavirus controlled, China's anthropogenic emissions rebounded in April and since then returned to the comparable levels of 2019 in the second half of 2020. The provinces in China have presented nearly synchronous decline and rebound in anthropogenic emissions, while Hubei and the provinces surrounding Beijing recovered more slowly due to the extension of lockdown measures. The ambient air pollution presented much lower concentrations during the first 3 months in 2020 than in 2019 while rapidly returning to comparable levels afterward, which have been reproduced by the air quality model simulation driven by our estimated emissions. China's monthly anthropogenic emissions in 2020 can be accessed from 10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5214920.v2 (Zheng et al., 2021) by species, month, sector, and province. © Copyright:","Zheng, B.; Zhang, Q.; Geng, G.; Chen, C.; Shi, Q.; Cui, M.; Lei, Y.; He, K.",Earth System Science Data,,427

METHODS: AYAs were recruited nationally, completed an online survey, and attended one of six online focus groups. We used qualitative content analysis to analyze focus group data. RESULTS: Thirty-nine AYAs completed the survey, and 24 also participated in the focus groups. In the survey, AYAs responded that COVID-19 increased anxiety about their health or their family's health, feelings of isolation, and worries about job security. Overarching focus group themes included AYA behavioral responses to the pandemic similar to their peers, the added burden of cancer, and unexpected advantages of a cancer history. When discussing the added burden of cancer, subthemes included difficulties and delays in medical care, mental health stressors, and compounding uncertainty. Unexpected advantages of a cancer history included relying on coping strategies developed during active treatment and resiliency from practicing social distancing during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: AYAs have struggled in the early pandemic in ways similar to their peers but with compounding uncertainty regarding their unknown risk due to cancer history. Healthcare providers and systems can better support AYAs by providing additional psychosocial supports, developing strategies to triage good candidates for telehealth, and providing information about cancer survivor-specific risks for COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Our findings indicate a need for psychosocial supports that address managing anxiety and uncertainty. AYAs may be able to draw on their cancer experiences to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shay, L Aubree; Allicock, Marlyn; Li, Amanda",Journal of cancer survivorship (Online),,427
210295,Fieldwork through the Zoomiverse: Sensing Uganda in a Time of Immobility,2021,"The emergence of Covid-19 in the United States has revealed a critical weakness in the health care system in the United States. The majority of people in the nation receive health care via employment-based health insurance from providers in a competitive market. However, neither employment-based health care nor a competitive health care market can adequately provide treatment during a global pandemic. Employment-based health care will fail to provide care for a large number of people in any destabilizing economic event, including a pandemic. Competitive for-profit health care systems distribute limited goods based on markets rather than health care needs. If a global pandemic results in unusually high demand for specific medical supplies, then these will be distributed suboptimally. The combined risk of suboptimal distribution of needed goods and a significant drop in health care access in a global pandemic indicates that the U.S. health care system has serious vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.","Kolmes, Sara",Hastings Cent Rep,,427

However, the subjective assessment of radiographic examination is a time-consuming task and demands expert radiologists. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have enhanced the diagnostic power of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools and assisted medical specialists in making efficient diagnostic decisions. In this work, we propose an optimal multilevel deep-aggregated boosted network to recognize COVID-19 infection from heterogeneous radiographic data, including X-ray and CT images. Our method leverages multilevel deep-aggregated features and multistage training via a mutually beneficial approach to maximize the overall CAD performance. To improve the interpretation of CAD predictions, these multilevel deep features are visualized as additional outputs that can assist radiologists in validating the CAD results. A total of six publicly available datasets were fused to build a single large-scale heterogeneous radiographic collection that was used to analyze the performance of the proposed technique and other baseline methods. To preserve generality of our method, we selected different patient data for training, validation, and testing, and consequently, the data of same patient were not included in training, validation, and testing subsets. In addition, fivefold cross-validation was performed in all the experiments for a fair evaluation. Our method exhibits promising performance values of 95.38%, 95.57%, 92.53%, 98.14%, 93.16%, and 98.55% in terms of average accuracy, F-measure, specificity, sensitivity, precision, and area under the curve, respectively and outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.","Owais, Muhammad; Lee, Young Won; Mahmood, Tahir; Haider, Adnan; Sultan, Haseeb; Park, Kang Ryoung",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,,427

Here, we investigate the cross-reactivity of antibodies raised against the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) for their reactivity toward SARS-CoV-2. We extensively characterize a selection of 10 antibodies covering all of the SARS-CoV structural proteins: spike, membrane, nucleocapsid, and envelope. Although nearly all of the examined SARS-CoV antibodies display some level of reactivity to SARS-CoV-2, we find only partial cross-neutralization for the spike antibodies. The implications of our work are two-fold. First, we establish a set of antibodies with known reactivity to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which will allow further study of both viruses. Second, we provide empirical evidence of the high propensity for antibody cross-reactivity between distinct strains of human coronaviruses, which is critical information for designing diagnostic and vaccine strategies for COVID-19.","Bates, Timothy A; Weinstein, Jules B; Farley, Scotland; Leier, Hans C; Messer, William B; Tafesse, Fikadu G",Cell Rep,,427

212457,From Covid to Career Change: Finding a New Path in the Middle of a Pandemic,2020,"The role of face masks to prevent and control COVID-19 is critical, especially since asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infected individuals can shed high loads of SARS-CoV-2 in the surrounding environment. In addition to being a two-way barrier to protect against virions droplets both in terms of ""source control"" (for the benefits of the community) and ""physical protection"" (for wearer), face masks also allow maintaining physiological temperatures and humidity of the nasal cavity and mouth, independently from the external environmental conditions. Beyond compromising the viral transmission speed, exposure to cold environments could have a detrimental effect on the host's susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. The innate human immune system becomes in fact weaker with cooler nose temperatures and thus more vulnerable to viral replication. Furthermore, there is evidence that warm, humid climates are associated with reduced spread of SARS-CoV-2, while cold dry conditions favor its stability and transmissibility. In the early stage of a viral infection, a physiological body temperature in the upper airways supports the innate immune system, endorsing the muco-ciliary clearance, inhibiting, or deactivating any first settlement of viruses. Face masks are therefore strongly recommended also outdoors, especially under cold weather conditions, not only as a physical barrier against the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but also to prevent the rapid cooling of the nasal mucosa and the inhibition of the human innate defense of the upper airways.","Bubbico, Luciano; Mastrangelo, Giuseppe; Larese-Filon, Francesca; Basso, Paolo; Rigoli, Roberto; Maurelli, Martina; Ferlito, Salvatore; Capelli, Marco; Gisabella, Claudio; Javanbakht, Mohammad; Bellizzi, Saverio; Cegolon, Luca",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,427

Since its emergence in December 2019, research has been focused on treating the infected, identifying those at risk and preventing spread. There is currently no known biological biomarker that predicts the risk of infection. Several studies emerged suggesting an association between ABO blood group and the risk of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we used retrospective observational data in Bahrain to investigate the association between ABO blood group and risk of infection, as well as susceptibility to severe ICU-requiring infection. We found a higher risk associated with blood group B, and a lower risk with blood group AB. No association was observed between blood group and the risk of a severe ICU-requiring infection. We extended the analysis to study the association by antibodies; anti-a (blood groups B and O) and anti-b (blood groups A and O). No association between antibodies and both risk of infection or susceptibility to severe infection was found. The current study, along with the variation in blood group association results, indicates that blood group may not be an ideal biomarker to predict risk of COVID-19 infection.","Almadhi, Marwa Ali; Abdulrahman, Abdulkarim; Alawadhi, Abdulla; Rabaan, Ali A; Atkin, Stephen; AlQahtani, Manaf",Sci Rep,,427
213707,Nursing in a pandemic,2020,"In the present study, we analyzed the immune response of calves to Brucella abortus strain 19 vaccine (S19) and its association with MHC class I (BoLA-A) alleles (exons 2-3 and 4-5). Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used for typing of BoLA-A exon 2-3 with DdeI and TaqI restriction enzymes; and exon 4-5 with HinfI in 45 crossbred calves. The PCR-RFLP analysis revealed five BoLA-A alleles each for exon 2-3 (A10/A19, A19, A18/19, A18 and A31) and exon 4-5 (A, B, C, D and E). Immune response against B. abortus S19 was assessed at the 4th week post vaccination; antibody response by standard tube agglutination test (STAT) and cell-mediated immunity by lymphocyte proliferation and lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity assays. Further, the macrophage function in terms of nitrite production was also analyzed. The association analysis of various BoLA-A alleles with the elicitation of immune response revealed that calves with certain defined genotypes induced significantly higher cell-mediated immune response in terms of lymphocyte proliferation with higher stimulation indices (S.I.) of 1.59 (BoLA-A19), 1.49 (A18/19) and 1.52 (HinfI-D); lymphocyte mediated cytotoxicity (55.52 % in A19) and nitrite production (43.40 µM in A31). It is assumed that allelic variants of BoLA-A (exons 2-3 and 4-5) were associated with the differential immune response of calves to B. abortus S19 vaccination. Therefore, further studies on association analysis of MHC class-I genes in large number of cattle may generate more information and might be useful for adapting the alternative approach of exploring genetic resistance in the cattle herd against bovine brucellosis.","Patra, Biswanath; Panigrahi, Manjit; Ahmad, Sheikh Firdous; Dandapat, Satyabrata; Kumar, Pushpendra; Bhushan, Bharat",Vet Microbiol,,427

Published data demonstrate the possibility of severe kidney injury in patients suffering from COVID-19. However, these data are still controversial. Methods: A total of 1,280 patients with a proven diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in our study. COVID-19 was confirmed in all patients using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test of a nasopharyngeal swab, and based on the typical computed tomography findings. Demographic data, underlying comorbidities, and laboratory blood tests were assessed. We assessed the incidence of AKI and its associated mortality defined by survival status at discharge. Results: Proteinuria was identified with 648 patients (50.6%) with COVID-19. AKI was identified in 371 patients (29.0%). Ten of these patients (2.7%) required dialysis. The risk factors for AKI included age of > 65 years, augmentation of C-reactive protein, ferritin and an increase in values of activated partial thromboplastin time. Overall, 162 of the 1,280 hospitalized patients (12.7%) and 111 of the 371 patients (29.9%) with AKI did not survive. The hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was 3.96 (95% confidence interval, 2.83-5.54) for patients with AKI vs. no AKI. Conclusion: AKI was a relatively common finding among patients with COVID-19. The risk factors for AKI in COVID-19 included old age, the inflammatory response, the severity of lung involvement, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. These same factors, in addition to arterial hypertension, were found to increase the risk of mortality.","Chebotareva, Natalia; Berns, Svetlana; Berns, Angelina; Androsova, Tatyana; Lebedeva, Marina; Moiseev, Sergey",,,427

We presented the outcomes of our patients to evaluate whether surgery could be safely performed and followed-up without delaying any stage of GIS cancer during the pandemic. METHODS: This was an observational study of 177 consecutive patients who underwent elective GIS cancer surgery between March 11 and November 1, 2020. They were assessed regarding their perioperative and 60 days follow-up results for either surgical or COVID-19 status. Morbidity was determined according to the Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC). Continuous and categorical data were presented as median ± SD and number with percentage (%), respectively. RESULTS: The study included 44 gastric, 33 pancreatic, 40 colon, and 59 rectal cancer patients. All patients underwent surgery and received neo/adjuvant treatments without delay. The overall morbidity (CDC grade II-IV) and mortality rates were 10.1% and 3.9%, respectively. None of the patients or medical staff were infected with COVID-19 during the study period. CONCLUSION: GIS cancer surgery can be safely performed even within a pandemic hospital if proper isolation measures can be achieved for both patients and health workers. Regardless of the tumor stage, surgery should not be deferred, depending on unstandardized algorithms.","Sozutek, Alper; Seker, Ahmet; Kuvvetli, Adnan; Ozer, Nazmi; Genc, Ismail Caner",J Surg Oncol,,427

Patients presented between January 25th and March 24th 2020. Information on clinical features, laboratory results, plasma cytokines/chemokines and lymphocyte subsets were analysed. Findings: Children admitted to hospital with COVID-19 were more likely to be male (67.7%) and the median age was 7.3 [IQR 4.9] years. All but one patient with severe disease was aged under 2 and the majority (5/7) had significant co-morbidities. Despite 53% having viral pneumonia on computed tomography (CT) scanning only 2 patients had low lymphocyte counts and no differences were observed in the levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- &#945; , and interferon (IFN)- Î³ between patients with mild, moderate or severe disease. Interpretations: We observed that the immune responses of children to COVID-19 infection is significantly different from that seen in adults. Our evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 does not trigger a robust inflammatory response or 'cytokine storm' in children with COVID-19, and this may underlie the generally better outcomes seen in children with this disease.","Qian, Guoqing; Zhang, Yong; Xu, Yang; Hu, Weihua; Hall, Ian P; Yue, Jiang; Lu, Hongyun; Ruan, Liemin; Ye, Maoqing; Mei, Jin",EClinicalMedicine,,427

216376,India and the pandemic: Democratic governance at crossroads,2021,"The Coronavirus pandemic created a global crisis that prompted immediate large-scale action, including economic shutdowns and mobility restrictions. These actions have had devastating effects on the economy, but some positive effects on the environment. As the world recovers from the pandemic, we ask the following question: What is the public attitude towards climate action during COVID-19 recovery and beyond? We answer this question by analyzing discussions on the Twitter social media platform. We find that most discussions support climate action and point out lessons learned during pandemic response that can shape future climate policy, although skeptics continue to have a presence. Additionally, concerns arise in the context of climate action during the pandemic, such as mitigating the risk of COVID-19 transmission on public transit.","Parsa, Mohammad S.; Golab, Lukasz; Keshav, Srinivasan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12190v1.pdf,427

The SARS-CoV-2 shares 79 and 50 per cent genome similarity with its predecessors, severe SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, all belonging to the same genus, Betacoronavirus. This relatively new virus has stymied the effective control of COVID-19 pandemic and caused huge social and economic impact worldwide. The FDA-approved drugs were re-purposed to reduce the number of fatalities caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, controversy surrounds about the efficacy of these re-purposed antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2.This necessitates the identification of new drug targets for SARS-CoV-2. Hence, the development of pre-clinical animal model is warranted. Such animal models may help us gain better understanding of the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and will be effective tools for the evaluation and licensure of therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2. This review provides a summary of the attempts made till to develop a suitable animal model to understand pathophysiology and effectiveness of therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2.","Munshi, Itti; Khandvilkar, Aditya; Chavan, Shrinivas M; Sachdeva, Geetanjali; Mahale, Smita D; Chaudhari, Uddhav K",Indian J Med Res,,427

It is unclear what future norovirus disease incidence is likely to look like upon lifting these restrictions. MethodsHere we use a mathematical model of norovirus fitted to community incidence data in England to project forward expected incidence based on contact surveys that have been collected throughout 2020-2021. ResultsWe report that susceptibility to norovirus infection has likely increased between March 2020 to mid-2021. Depending upon assumptions of future contact patterns incidence of norovirus that is similar to pre-pandemic levels or an increase beyond what has been previously reported is likely to occur once restrictions are lifted. Should adult contact patterns return to 80% of pre-pandemic levels the incidence of norovirus will be similar to previous years. If contact patterns return to pre-pandemic levels there is a potential for the expected annual incidence to be up to 2-fold larger than in a typical year. The age-specific incidence is similar across all ages. ConclusionsContinued national surveillance for endemic diseases such as norovirus will be essential after NPIs are lifted to allow healthcare services to adequately prepare for a potential increase in cases and hospital pressures beyond what is typically experienced.","O039, Kathleen M; Reilly,; Sandmann, Frank; Allen, David; Jarvis, Christopher I; Gimma, Amy; Douglas, Amy; Larkin, Lesley; Wong, Kerry LM; Baguelin, Marc; Baric, Ralph S.; Lindesmith, Lisa; Goldstein, Richard A; Breuer, Judith; Edmunds, W John",,,427
217647,Can we get back to Brexit?,2020,"Suspension of face-to-face instruction in schools during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to concerns about consequences for students' learning. So far, data to study this question have been limited. Here we evaluate the effect of school closures on primary school performance using exceptionally rich data from The Netherlands (n &#8776; 350,000). We use the fact that national examinations took place before and after lockdown and compare progress during this period to the same period in the 3 previous years. The Netherlands underwent only a relatively short lockdown (8 wk) and features an equitable system of school funding and the world's highest rate of broadband access. Still, our results reveal a learning loss of about 3 percentile points or 0.08 standard deviations. The effect is equivalent to one-fifth of a school year, the same period that schools remained closed. Losses are up to 60% larger among students from less-educated homes, confirming worries about the uneven toll of the pandemic on children and families. Investigating mechanisms, we find that most of the effect reflects the cumulative impact of knowledge learned rather than transitory influences on the day of testing. Results remain robust when balancing on the estimated propensity of treatment and using maximum-entropy weights or with fixed-effects specifications that compare students within the same school and family. The findings imply that students made little or no progress while learning from home and suggest losses even larger in countries with weaker infrastructure or longer school closures.","Engzell, Per; Frey, Arun; Verhagen, Mark D",Proc.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The number of patients diagnosed and treated within 17 of the 18 Unicancer centers was collected in 2020 and compared with that during the same periods between 2016 and 2019. Unicancer centers treat close to 20% of cancer patients in France yearly. The reduction in the number of patients attending the Unicancer centers was analyzed per regions and cancer types. The impact of delayed care on cancer-related deaths was calculated based on different hypotheses. RESULTS: A 6.8% decrease in patients managed within Unicancer in the first 7 months of 2020 versus 2019 was observed. This reduction reached 21% during April and May, and was not compensated in June and July, nor later until November 2020. This reduction was observed only for newly diagnosed patients, while the clinical activity for previously diagnosed patients increased by 4% similar to previous years. The reduction was more pronounced in women, in breast and prostate cancers, and for patients without metastasis. Using an estimated hazard ratio of 1.06 per month of delay in diagnosis and treatment of new patients, we calculated that the delays observed in the 5-month period from March to July 2020 may result in an excess mortality due to cancer of 1000-6000 patients in coming years. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the delays in cancer patient management were observed only for newly diagnosed patients, more frequently in women, for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and nonmetastatic cancers. These delays may result is an excess risk of cancer-related deaths in the coming years.","Blay, J Y; Boucher, S; Le Vu, B; Cropet, C; Chabaud, S; Perol, D; Barranger, E; Campone, M; Conroy, T; Coutant, C; De Crevoisier, R; Debreuve-Theresette, A; Delord, J P; Fumoleau, P; Gentil, J; Gomez, F; Guerin, O; Jaffré, A; Lartigau, E; Lemoine, C; Mahe, M A; Mahon, F X; Mathieu-Daude, H; Merrouche, Y; Penault-Llorca, F; Pivot, X; Soria, J C; Thomas, G; Vera, P; Vermeulin, T; Viens, P; Ychou, M; Beaupere, S",ESMO Open,,427

(Special Issue: Sport and the coronavirus crisis.),2020,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization characterizes novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a pandemic. Here, we investigated the clinical, cytokine levels; T-cell proportion; and related gene expression occurring in patients with COVID-19 on admission and after initial treatment. METHODS: Eleven patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with similar initial treatment regimens were enrolled in the hospital. Plasma cytokine, peripheral T cell proportions, and microfluidic quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses for gene expression were conducted. RESULTS: Five patients with mild and 6 with severe disease were included. Cough and fever were the primary symptoms in the 11 COVID-19 cases. Older age, higher neutrophil count, and higher C-reactive protein levels were found in severe cases. IL-10 level significantly varied with disease progression and treatment. Decreased T-cell proportions were observed in patients with COVID-19, especially in severe cases, and all were returned to normal in patients with mild disease after initial treatment, but only CD4+ T cells returned to normal in severe cases. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) increased with the disease progression, and decreased after initial treatment. All downregulated DEGs in severe cases mainly involved Th17-cell differentiation, cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, and T-cell activation. After initial treatment in severe cases, MAP2K7 and SOS1 were upregulated relative to that on admission. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that a decreased T-cell proportion with downregulated gene expression related to T-cell activation and differentiation occurred in patients with severe COVID-19, which may help to provide effective treatment strategies for COVID-19.","Ouyang, Yabo; Yin, Jiming; Wang, Wenjing; Shi, Hongbo; Shi, Ying; Xu, Bin; Qiao, Luxin; Feng, Yingmei; Pang, Lijun; Wei, Feili; Guo, Xianghua; Jin, Ronghua; Chen, Dexi",Clin Infect Dis,,427

Currently, there is no effective treatment for the infection. Areas covered: We have recently described the NZACE2-Patari project, which seeks to administer modified Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) molecules early in the infection to intercept and block SARS-CoV-2 binding to the pulmonary epithelium. Expert opinion: Since the nasopharyngeal mucosa is infected in the first asymptomatic phase of the infection, treatment of the nose is likely to be safe and potentially effective. The intercepted virus will be swallowed and destroyed in the stomach. There is however a limited window of opportunity to alter the trajectory of the infection in an individual patient, which requires access to rapid testing for SARS-CoV-2. The proposed strategy is analogous to passive immunization of viral infections such as measles and may be of particular benefit to immunodeficient and unvaccinated individuals.","Ameratunga, Rohan; Woon, See-Tarn; Steele, Richard; Snell, Russell; Medlicott, Natalie; Mears, Emily; Leung, Euphemia; Lehnert, Klaus; Jordan, Anthony; Das, Shyamal; Abbott, William; Longhurst, Hilary; Quiñones-Mateu, Miguel E",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,,427

Design: Prospective, observational cohort study. Setting: Tertiary-care, academic medical center in Nashville, TN. Patients: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure admitted to the adult ICU without venous thromboembolism at the time of ICU admission. Intervention: None. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was development of venous thromboembolism during the index hospitalization. Venous thromboembolism was defined by clinical imaging or autopsy, demonstrating deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Forty consecutive critically ill adults with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 were enrolled; 37 (92.5%) were hypercoagulable by at least one thromboelastography parameter at the time of ICU admission and 12 (30%) met the primary outcome of venous thromboembolism during the index hospitalization. Patients who developed venous thromboembolism had decreased measures of clotting (maximum amplitude, alpha angle, shear elastic modulus parameter, and clotting index) on ICU admission thromboelastography compared with patients who did not develop venous thromboembolism (p < 0.05 for all measures). For each individual thromboelastography parameter used to dichotomize patients as hypercoagulable, the rate of venous thromboembolism was not higher in those identified as hypercoagulable; in fact, the venous thromboembolism rate was higher in patients who were not hypercoagulable by thromboelastography for maximum amplitude (p = 0.04) and alpha angle (p = 0.001). Platelet count was positively correlated with maximum amplitude, alpha angle, G parameter, and clotting index, and significantly lower in patients who developed venous thromboembolism than those who did not (median 186 vs 278 103/µL, p = 0.046). Venous thromboembolism was associated with inhospital mortality (odds ratio, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.4-29; p = 0.02). Conclusions: Our data do not support the use of thromboelastography to risk stratify critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 for the development of venous thromboembolism or to guide decisions about anticoagulation. Lower platelet count on ICU admission, which may reflect platelet aggregation, was associated with venous thromboembolism.","Marvi, Tanya K; Stubblefield, William B; Tillman, Benjamin F; Tenforde, Mark W; Feldstein, Leora R; Patel, Manish M; Self, Wesley H; Grijalva, Carlos G; Rice, Todd W",Crit Care Explor,,427

Whether non-drug interventions can be alternative therapies for COVID-19 patients with anxiety, depression and sleep disorders is controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review to evaluate the effects of non-drug interventions on anxiety, depression and sleep in patients with COVID-19 to provide guidance for clinical application. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from December 2019 to July 2020: China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), Wanfang, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase. Two investigators independently screened the literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.3 software. RESULTS: A total of 5 articles with 768 subjects were included. Meta-analysis results indicated that non-drug interventions can reduce anxiety [SMD=-1.40, 95% CI (-1.62, -1.17), p<0.00001] and depression [SMD=-1.22, 95% CI (-2.01, -0.43), p=0.002] scores in patients with COVID-19. Descriptive analysis indicated that non-drug interventions can improve the sleep status of COVID-19 patients. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the meta-analysis results were stable. Egger's test and Begg's test showed no publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis found that non-drug interventions can reduce the anxiety and depression scores of patients with COVID-19. Due to the limitations of this study, more high-quality studies are needed to verify the findings, especially the effect of non-drug interventions on improving the sleep status of COVID-19 patients.","Ding, H; He, F; Lu, Y-G; Hao, S-W; Fan, X-J",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,427

The complete S-gene sequence of 7 Spanish SeCoV and 30 PEDV Spanish isolates was phylogenetically analysed including the S-gene sequences of the three SeCoV and a representative selection of the PEDV strains with complete genome sequences available in the GenBank. The tree showed a common ancestor for the S-gene of the PEDV and SeCoV, but no evolution from any known PEDV clade was shown for the SeCoV strains. Moreover, complete genome sequences were obtained from 23 PEDV strains recovered in Spanish swine farms since 2014. The phylogenetic tree showed the INDEL type genogroup of these Spanish strains, supporting the lower pathogenicity of this genogroup since no significant economic losses were reported in the affected Spanish swine farms. Four subgroups were detected among PEDV strains in Spain, closely related to the recent European strains. Moreover, eight of the most recent Spanish PEDV isolates formed a subclade together with three European strains from 2015, showing a new evolution branch with a recombinant virus.","de Nova, Pedro J G; Cortey, Martí; Díaz, Ivan; Puente, Héctor; Rubio, Pedro; Martín, Marga; Carvajal, Ana",,,427

221636,Attention-RefNet: Interactive Attention Refinement Network for Infected Area Segmentation of COVID-19,2021,"Purpose: This study aims to identify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical resident training and education at Danbury Hospital. Methods: We conducted an observational study at a Western Connecticut hospital heavily affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its effects on surgical residents, focusing on surgical education, clinical experience, and operative skills development. Objective data was available through recorded work hours, case logs, and formal didactics. In addition, we created an anonymous survey to assess resident perception of their residency experience during the pandemic. Results: There are 22 surgical residents at our institution; all were included in the study. Resident weekly duty hours decreased by 23.9 hours with the majority of clinical time redirected to caring for COVID-19 patients. Independent studying increased by 1.6 hours (26.2%) while weekly didactics decreased by 2.1 hours (35.6%). The operative volume per resident decreased by 65.7% from 35.0 to 12.0 cases for the period of interest, with a disproportionately high effect on junior residents, who experienced a 76.2% decrease. Unsurprisingly, 70% of residents reported a negative effect of the pandemic on their surgical skills. Conclusions: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical residents' usual workflows changed dramatically, as much of their time was dedicated to the critical care of patients with COVID-19. However, the consequent opportunity cost was to surgery-specific training; there was a significant decrease in operative cases and time spent in surgical didactics, along with elevated concern about overall preparedness for their intended career.","Ostapenko, Alexander; McPeck, Samantha; Liechty, Shawn; Kleiner, Daniel",J Med Educ Curric Dev,,427

The effect of glucocorticoid on imaging progress, adverse events, nucleic acid results and the outcomes were investigated. Lymphocyte count and C-reactive protein (CRP) significantly differed between the glucocorticoid therapy and non-glucocorticoid therapy groups. Compared with the non-glucocorticoid therapy group, glucocorticoid therapy did not significantly influence the clinical course of COVID-19 pneumonia, including imaging progress and the time duration for negative transformation of nucleic acid. Glucocorticoid therapy did not significantly influence the outcomes nor the adverse events of COVID-19 pneumonia. For the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, systemic and in-depth investigation is needed to determine the timing and dosage of glucocorticoids needed to inhibit overwhelming inflammatory response and not the protective immune response to COVID-19 pneumonia.","Hu, Yan; Wang, Tingping; Hu, Zhimin; Wang, Xuan; Zhang, Zhengbin; Li, Li; Peng, Peng",Biomed Pharmacother,,427

Based on the review of the literature and a variety of examples that focus on the role of information quality in policy design, and drawing on two phenomena from the field of epidemiology (namely, over-adjustment and unnecessary adjustment), the article enhances the definitional clarity of the terms under investigation and allows us to address the difficulty in reconciling technical problem solving with politics. The article proposes new definitional statements of proportionate and disproportionate policy designs that vary according to the extent to which the main design properties are adjusted to low-quality information. It also explores distinct variations in a few policy characteristics resulting from over- and under-design. The policy characteristics examined here include economic efficiency, policy effectiveness, policy robustness; the space for making significant changes at a later stage when high-quality information becomes available; the potential consequences in terms of policy over- and under-reaction; and the political ramifications of these suboptimal designs for elected executives. With regard to the interaction between technical and political logics, the article posits that deliberate policy over- and under-design can be viewed as solutions to serious political problems faced by elected executives, especially in politically sensitive times. Therefore, it facilitates a more realistic understanding of the conditions under which a policy is under- or over-designed to respond to some objectives but entirely proportionate with regard to others.","Maor, Moshe",Policy Sci,,427

222464,Pandemic's glossary: The ABC of coronavirus concepts,2020,"Compelling evidence supports the crucial role of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) axis activation in many clinical entities. Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, there is an increasing concern about the risk and handling of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, clinical data raised during pandemic suggests that IBD patients do not have an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection or develop a more severe course of infection. In the present review, we intend to highlight how two potentially important contributors to the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD patients, the RAGE axis activation as well as the cross-talk with the renin-angiotensin system, are dampened by the high expression of soluble forms of both RAGE and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2. The soluble form of RAGE functions as a decoy for its ligands, and soluble ACE2 seems to be an additionally attenuating contributor to RAGE axis activation, particularly by avoiding the transactivation of the RAGE axis that can be produced by the virus-mediated imbalance of the ACE/angiotensin II/angiotensin II receptor type 1 pathway.","Rojas, Armando; Schneider, Iván; Lindner, Cristian; Gonzàlez, Ileana; Morales, Miguel Angel",World J Gastroenterol,,427
223187,The coronavirus pandemic: How can design help?,2020,"The impacts of COVID-19 are not evenly distributed in society. Understanding demographic and occupational differences in personal experiences and information seeking and how these shape perceptions of COVID-19 related risk may help to improve the effectiveness of public health strategies in the future. We surveyed a nationally representative sample of 496 participants during the first UK lockdown, in May 2020. We recorded data to assess people’s experiences of the pandemic, examining how they varied with demographic factors such as age, gender, occupational status, and key worker status. We also recorded data on COVID-19 related information seeking, and how experiences and information seeking behaviours were related to perceptions of COVID-19 related risk. We found that key workers reported greater exposure to COVID-19 and more extensive experience of the virus within their social circles. Those key workers who perceived their personal protective equipment to be more effective felt that the virus was less of a threat to their lives. Trust in COVID-19 information was highest in information from the UK Government and NHS, and lowest in information from social media. We also found that men reported lower levels of perceived threat to life from the virus than women–a difference that mirrors the gender difference in occupational risk within our sample. Among those in employment, lower occupational class was also associated with higher levels of perceived risk of infection and perceived threat to life. Key workers who feel that they are insufficiently protected by their PPE experience increased levels of perceived threat, which may lead to negative health behaviours. This highlights the need for employers to ensure that key workers feel they are adequately protected from COVID-19. Our findings highlight some of the inequalities in the distribution of risk across society and discuss demographic differences in perceptions of risk. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Brown, R.; Coventry, L.; Pepper, G.",Journal of Risk Research,,427

226604,Mining urban sustainable performance: Spatio-temporal emission potential changes of urban transit buses in post-COVID-19 future,2020,"The global trend within medical curricula to significantly reduce anatomy teaching hours demonstrates there is a clear need for instructors to become more creative in their development of outside teaching resources. Yet, instructors must be cognizant not to overload students with extraneous work that derails a reasonable work-life balance as student wellness is a high priority. To combat these two seemingly contradictory expectations, this study explored the impact of exercise-focused anatomy review sessions on medical students. We investigated the success in which movement aided in content retention as well as its influence on wellness, and attitude toward learning. Our research was a non-blinded, randomized-controlled study with voluntary recruitment of 1st and 2nd year medical students. The experimental group attended 1 in-person (pre-COVID) and 3 video (post-COVID) anatomy led exercise review sessions. These sessions consisted of performing demonstrated exercise techniques that correlated with anatomical concepts relating to the week's topic. A control group was also recruited and received four online anatomy review packets of synonymous content to be studied for the same duration of time as the experimental group, void of physical activity. The four anatomy sessions were divided by topic, teaching abdominal, upper extremity, lower extremity, and neuroanatomy. To measure anatomical comprehension, pre- and post-session quizzes formatted into board-style clinical questions were administered and compared in both groups. Subjective data was solicited in the form of student comments and a standardized survey focusing on physical awareness, exercise practices, and perceived physical and mental wellness before and after the course. Results indicated no statistically significant difference between the pre- and post-quiz scores amongst the control and exercise groups (control: pre 19, post 23;experiment: pre 19, post 22). Both groups improved their score, demonstrating anatomical comprehension regardless of review session format. Differences were found however, between student responses in the wellness survey. 92.3% of the exercise group found the sessions to be at least somewhat enjoyable, whereas only 46.2% of the control group offered the same rating. 92.3% of the exercise group would recommend the exercise anatomy sessions to a classmate, and 84.6% of the exercise group believes exercise anatomy sessions are something that should be incorporated into medical school curricula. The experimental group's views on in-person versus video exercise sessions were also compared. 46.2% felt they got more out of the in-person session than the videos, while 30.8% found the in-person and video sessions equally beneficial. The benefit of exercise in medical students is both timely and valuable, as our society has become more conscientious of the importance of health and wellness. Our study demonstrated that both in-person and video exercise sessions led to positive attitudes toward learning anatomy. This finding is of particular interest during the time of COVID in which most live teaching events are not possible. Furthermore, incorporating movement into reviewing curricular content can be a way to promote physical wellbeing to medical students.","Guzzardo, Gabrielle Gilbert Maryssa Schaefer Maureen Nazaroff Carrie",The FASEB Journal,,427

226749,A data-driven understanding of COVID-19 dynamics using sequential genetic algorithm based probabilistic cellular automata,2020,"The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has brought into focus the key role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as a cell surface receptor required for the virus to enter cells. SARS-CoV-2 can decrease cell surface ACE2 directly by internalization of ACE2 bound to the virus and indirectly by increased ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17)-mediated shedding of ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed in the heart, lungs, vasculature, kidney and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where it counteracts the deleterious effects of angiotensin II (AngII) by catalyzing the conversion of AngII into the vasodilator peptide angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)). The down-regulation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 can be detrimental to the cardiovascular system and kidneys. Further, decreased ACE2 can cause gut dysbiosis, inflammation and potentially worsen the systemic inflammatory response and coagulopathy associated with SARS-CoV-2. This review aims to elucidate the crucial role of ACE2 both as a regulator of the renin-angiotensin system and a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as the implications for Coronavirus disease 19 and its associated cardiovascular and renal complications.","Sharma, Ravindra K; Li, Jing; Krishnan, Suraj; Richards, Elaine M; Raizada, Mohan K; Mohandas, Rajesh",Clin Sci (Lond),,427

227102,The distributive implications of welfare reform packages. The Italian case during and after the great crisis,2020,"Viral and bacterial pathogens can be transmitted through direct contact with contaminated surfaces. Efficient decontamination of contaminated surfaces could lead to decreased disease transmission, if optimized methods for detecting contaminated surfaces can be developed. Here we describe such a method whereby thermal tracking technology is utilized to detect thermal signatures incurred by surfaces through direct contact. This is applicable in public places to assist with targeted sanitation and cleaning efforts to potentially reduce chance of disease transmission. In this study, we refer to the touched region of the surface as a ""touch-point"" and examine how the touch-point regions can be automatically localized with a computer vision pipeline of a thermal image sequence. The pipeline mainly comprises two components: a single-frame and a multi-frame analysis. The single-frame analysis consists of a Background subtraction method for image pre-processing and a U-net deep learning model for segmenting the touch-point regions. The multi-frame analysis performs a summation of the outputs from the single-frame analysis and creates a cumulative map of touch-points. Results show that the touch-point detection pipeline can achieve 75.0% precision and 81.5% F1-score for the testing experiments of predicting the touch-point regions. This preliminary study shows potential applications of preventing indirect pathogen spread in public spaces and improving the efficiency of cleaning sanitation.","Ma, Guangshen; Ross, Weston; Tucker, Matthew; Hsu, Po-Chun; Buckland, Daniel M; Codd, Patrick J",IEEE J Transl Eng Health Med,,427

Methods: This comparative cross-sectional study was done at a tertiary care teaching institute. We enrolled all hospitalized children aged 1 month - 18 years and diagnosed with either MIS-C and/or dengue fever according to WHO criteria between June and December, 2020. Clinical and laboratory features and outcomes were recorded on a structured proforma. RESULTS: During the study period 34 cases of MIS-C and 83 cases of Dengue fever were enrolled. Mean age of MIS-C cases (male, 86.3%) was 7.89 (4.61) years. MIS-C with shock was seen in 15 cases (44%), MIS-C without shock in 17 cases (50%) and Kawasaki disease-like presentation in 2 cases (6%). Patients of MIS-C were younger as compared to dengue fever (P=0.002). Abdominal pain and erythematous rash were more common in dengue fever. Of the inflammatory markers, mean C reactive protein was higher in MIS-C patients [100.2 (85.1) vs 16.9 (29.3) mg/dL] (P<0.001). In contrast, serum ferritin levels were higher in dengue fever patients (P=0.03). Mean hospital stay (patient days) was longer in MIS- C compared to dengue fever (8.6 vs 6.5 days;P=0.014). CONCLUSION: Clinical and laboratory features can give important clues to differentiate dengue fever and MIS-C and help initiate specific treatment.","Dhooria, G. S.; Kakkar, S.; Pooni, P.

228205,Teaching Programming for Mathematical Scientists,2020-10-30,"Corticosteroids remain the mainstay of the treatment for various ocular conditions affecting the ocular surface, anterior and posterior segments of the eye due to their anti-inflammatory, anti-oedematous, and anti-neovascularization properties. Prednisolone, prednisolone acetate, dexamethasone, triamcinolone acetonide, fluocinolone acetonide, and loteprednol etabonate are amongst the most widely used ophthalmic corticosteroids. Corticosteroids differ in their activity and potency in the eye due to their inherent pharmacological and pharmaceutical differences. Different routes and regimens are available for ocular administration of corticosteroids. Conventional topical application to the eye is the route of choice when targeting diseases affecting the ocular surface and anterior segment, while periocular, intravitreal, and suprachoroidal injections can be potentially effective for posterior segment diseases. Corticosteroid-induced intraocular pressure elevation and cataract formation remain the most significant local risks following topical as well as systemic corticosteroid administration. Invasive drug administration via intracameral, subconjunctival, and intravitreal injection can enhance ocular bioavailability and minimize dose and dosing frequency of administration, yet may exacerbate ocular side effects of corticosteroids.

228380,A Global Pandemic Remedy to Vaccine Nationalism (preprint),2021,"Transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 from humans to animals has been reported for many domesticated species, including farmed minks. The identification of novel spike gene mutations appearing in minks has raised major concerns about potential immune evasion and challenges for the global vaccine strategy. One genetic variant, known as ""cluster five,"" arose among farmed minks in Denmark and resulted in a complete shutdown of the world's largest mink production. However, the functional properties of this new variant are not established. Here we present functional data on the cluster-five variant, which contains a mutation resulting in a Y453F residue change in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Using an ELISA-based angiotensin-converting enzyme-2/RBD inhibition assay, we show that the Y453F variant does not decrease established humoral immunity from previously infected individuals or affect the neutralizing antibody response in a vaccine mouse model based on the original Wuhan strain RBD or spike as antigens. However, biolayer interferometry analysis demonstrates that it binds the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor with a 4-fold higher affinity than the original strain, suggesting an enhanced transmission capacity and a possible challenge for viral control. These results also indicate that the rise in the frequency of the cluster-five variant in mink farms might be a result of the fitness advantage conferred by the receptor adaptation rather than evading immune responses.","Bayarri-Olmos, Rafael; Rosbjerg, Anne; Johnsen, Laust Bruun; Helgstrand, Charlotte; Bak-Thomsen, Theresa; Garred, Peter; Skjoedt, Mikkel-Ole",J Biol Chem,,427

229567,Covid-19: UK government calls on industry to help boost testing capacity to 25 000 people a day,2020,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has impacted nearly the whole world due to its high morbidity and mortality rate. Thus, scientists around the globe are working to find potent drugs and designing an effective vaccine against COVID-19. Phytochemicals from medicinal plants are known to have a long history for the treatment of various pathogens and infections; thus, keeping this in mind, this study was performed to explore the potential of different phytochemicals as candidate inhibitors of the HR1 domain in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by using computer-aided drug discovery methods. Initially, the pharmacological assessment was performed to study the drug-likeness properties of the phytochemicals for their safe human administration. Suitable compounds were subjected to molecular docking to screen strongly binding phytochemicals with HR1 while the stability of ligand binding was analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations. Quantum computation-based density functional theory (DFT) analysis was constituted to analyze the reactivity of these compounds with the receptor. Through analysis, 108 phytochemicals passed the pharmacological assessment and upon docking of these 108 phytochemicals, 36 were screened passing a threshold of -8.5 kcal/mol. After analyzing stability and reactivity, 5 phytochemicals, i.e., SilybinC, Isopomiferin, Lycopene, SilydianinB, and Silydianin are identified as novel and potent candidates for the inhibition of HR1 domain in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Based on these results, it is concluded that these compounds can play an important role in the design and development of a drug against COVID-19, after an exhaustive in vitro and in vivo examination of these compounds, in future.","Majeed, Arshia; Hussain, Waqar; Yasmin, Farkhanda; Akhtar, Ammara; Rasool, Nouman",Biomed Res Int,,427
229789,Temporary caps lack crucial information,2020,"Objectives: Working remotely comes with significant pros and cons with different demands for individuals or teams. E-working has been the object of much interest, but there has been little research on the statistical difference between its advantages and disadvantages. Research Question: Is there a significant statistical difference between them? Methods: The present research, however, goes one step further and identifies the statistical difference between them. Firstly, we evaluated the positive and negative aspects with a meta-analysis of 20 studies and, secondly, we used a non-parametric test, namely the Wilcoxon Rank Test, for further analysis across pros and cons. Findings: We found that e-working provides more positive than negative ones. A binomial test showed that most studies (more than 50%) mention flexibility, productivity and efficiency, satisfaction and WLB as benefits. Novelty/improvement: E-working is a triple win option. There are many advantages to working remotely, but this method of work does not suit everyone. Our results provide building blocks for a more complete theoretical and practical treatment of e-working for the future. But COVID-19, technology advancement and a connected global world show clearly that e-working will play a crucial role in the future of the workplace. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we evaluate how various countries have performed in sequencing from the perspectives of ""fraction"", ""timeliness"", and ""openness"". We found that high proportions of samples were sequenced in the UK, the USA, Australia, and Iceland; sequencing was performed promptly in Iceland, the Netherlands, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; and data were shared timely from the Netherlands, the USA, Iceland, and the UK. Although many developing countries have high numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infected cases but few published sequences, we observed good performance on sequencing efforts for some low- and middle-income countries. Further strengthening of the sequencing capacity at a global level would help in the fight against not only the current pandemic but also future outbreaks of viral diseases.","Furuse, Yuki",Int J Infect Dis,,427

In our serosurveillance on an industrial workforce of randomly selected 3296 subjects, COVID-19 IgG antibody positivity was reported in 7.37% (243) subjects. However, when 30 days later, eight of the 243 COVID-19 IgG antibody-positive individuals complained of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection and were confirmed as COVID-19 infection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), their COVID-19 IgG antibodies were retested. Seven of the eight previously IgG positive individuals had lost their protective antibodies. Methods Subsequently, a prospective clinical trial was planned by repeating the test for IgG antibodies on the remaining earlier positive 235 individuals at 45-65 days after their initial test. Only 201 of the 235 individuals consented and participated in the non-randomized single-arm observational trial. Results Only 28.36% (57/201) retained their IgG antibodies and 70.15% (141/201) had lost their IgG antibodies. Three cases reported equivocal results on retesting. Conclusions Our findings show that the protective COVID-19 IgG antibodies rapidly decline over one to three months. Further studies are needed with a quantitative assay over a period with neutralizing antibodies to establish if its decay can potentially lead to reinfections. Rapidly decaying protective IgG antibodies would impact herd immunity and vaccine durability. It is critical for the potential vaccines to generate both protective T- and B-cell immune responses in a sustained manner.","Nag, Deb Sanjay; Chaudhry, Rajan; Mishra, Minakshi; Rai, Sudhir; Gupta, Minakshi",Cureus,,427

However, there is a paucity of data on the efficiency of different nucleic acid extraction platforms on pooled specimens. This study compared a novel automated high-throughput liquid-based RNA extraction (LRE) platform (PHASIFY&#8482;) with a widely used magnetic bead-based total nucleic acid extraction (MBTE) platform (NucliSENS® easyMAG®). A total of 60 pools of nasopharyngeal swab and 60 pools of posterior oropharyngeal saliva specimens, each consisting of 1 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 9 SARS-CoV-2 negative specimens, were included for the comparison. Real-time RT-PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp/Hel gene was performed, and GAPDH RT-PCR was used to detect RT-PCR inhibitors. No significant differences were observed in the Ct values and overall RT-PCR positive rates between LRE and MBTE platforms (92.5% (111/120] vs. 90% (108/120]), but there was a slightly higher positive rate for LRE (88.3% (53/60]) than MBTE (81.7% (49/60]) among pooled saliva. The automated LRE method is comparable to a standard MBTE method for the detection of SAR-CoV-2 in pooled specimens, providing a suitable alternative automated extraction platform. Furthermore, LRE may be better suited for pooled saliva specimens due to more efficient removal of RT-PCR inhibitors.","Chu, Allen Wing-Ho; Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; Chan, Wan-Mui; Ng, Anthony Chin-Ki; Chan, Dream Lok-Sze; Siu, Ryan Ho-Ping; Chung, Cheuk Yiu Tenny; Ng, Jessica Pui-Ling; Kittur, Harsha; Mosley, Garrett Lee; Poon, Rosana Wing-Shan; Chiu, Ricky Yin-To; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang",Viruses,,427

However, the quality of AMV implementation has varied greatly across states, leading to mixed results in previous research. We exploit the understudied 2014 implementation of AMV in Colorado to estimate the effect on turnout for all registered voters, along with age, racial, education, income and wealth, and occupational subgroups. Using large voter file data and a difference-in-differences design within individuals, we find a positive overall turnout effect of approximately 8 percentage points—translating into an additional 900,000 ballots being cast between 2014 and 2018. Effects are significantly larger among lower-propensity voting groups, such as young people, blue-collar workers, voters with less educational attainment, and voters of color. The results suggest that researchers and policymakers should look to Colorado's AMV approach as an effective model for boosting aggregate turnout and reducing voting disparities across subgroups.","Bonica, Adam Grumbach Jacob M.; Hill, Charlotte Jefferson Hakeem",Electoral Studies,,427

Given that Indigenous pathways to homelessness can differ from non-Indigenous youth, interventions that address homelessness must also adapt to meet diverse needs. The Housing Outreach Program Collaborative (HOP-C) is a tertiary prevention intervention designed to provide congruent housing and peer and mental health supports for youth experiencing homelessness in Toronto, Ontario. Less is known regarding its adaptability to adequately serve Indigenous youth in northwestern Ontario. This study assessed the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of an adaptation of the HOP-C North program for transitional aged Indigenous youth exiting homelessness in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Participants completed premeasures (n = 15) and postmeasures (n = 8) as well as qualitative interviews regarding their experiences in the program. Qualitative interviews were also conducted with staff (n = 14) engaged in implementing the program. After completing the HOP-C North program, participants reported improvements in a number of outcomes, including increased educational enrollment, attainment of employment, reduced hospitalizations, and increased engagement in clinical mental health services. Specific program aspects that participants found helpful included increased program flexibility, accessibility, emphasis on relationships, relevance of programming, fostering participant autonomy, and an adaptive approach to program implementation. These findings suggest that the HOP-C North model, when adapted, is a helpful program for Indigenous youth.

There has been a shortage of essential supplies in the area, especially alcohol-based hand sanitizer. In this context, and in accordance with the decree dated March 6, 2020, our hospital management team asked us to start local production of alcohol-based handrub. This was a real challenge: In one week, we had to implement the production of handrub to meet the needs of a 1,400-bed hospital. The production had to comply with the French preparation guidelines and take place on specific premises, with qualified and calibrated equipment, by qualified staff, under the supervision of a pharmacist. The other big challenge we faced was the supply of pharmaceutical raw and packaging materials. During this particular critical period, all suppliers were out of stock. Here, we describe the organizational set-up and the decisions made, e. g., to use technical-grade ethanol before the publication of the decrees dated March 13 and March 23, 2020.","Di-Falco, Elodie; Bourbon, Johan; Sbaffe, Isalyne; Kaiser, Jean-Daniel",Pharm.

237005,Covid-19: Leading statistician welcomes UK government's move to improve testing data,2020,"The outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) disease is overwhelming resources, economies and countries around the world. Millions of people have been infected and hundreds of thousands have succumbed to the virus. Research regarding the coronavirus pandemic is published every day. However, there is limited discourse regarding societal perception. Thus, this paper examines blame attribution concerning the origin and propagation of the coronavirus crisis according to public perception. Specifically, data were extracted from the social media platform Twitter concerning the coronavirus during the early stages of the outbreak and further investigated using thematic analysis. The findings revealed the public predominantly blames national governments for the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, the results documented the explosion of conspiracy theories among social media users regarding the virus' origin. In the early stages of the pandemic, the blame tendency was most frequent to conspiracy theories and restriction of information from the government, whilst in the later months, responsibility had shifted to political leaders and the media. The findings indicate an emerging government mistrust that may result in disregard of preventive health behaviours and the amplification of conspiracy theories, and an evolving dynamic of blame. This study argues for a transparent, continuing dialogue between governments and the public to stop the spread of the coronavirus.","Choli, Marilena; Kuss, Daria J",Comput Human Behav,,427
237596,Antimicrobial use in the time of COVID-19-data from 84 va facilities,2020,"Healthcare-acquired infections are a tremendous challenge to the US medical system. Stethoscopes touch many patients, but current guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not support disinfection between each patient. Stethoscopes are rarely disinfected between patients by healthcare providers. When cultured, even after disinfection, stethoscopes have high rates of pathogen contamination, identical to that of unwashed hands. The consequence of these practices may bode poorly in the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Alternatively, the CDC recommends the use of disposable stethoscopes. However, these instruments have poor acoustic properties, and misdiagnoses have been documented. They may also serve as pathogen vectors among staff sharing them. Disposable aseptic stethoscope diaphragm barriers can provide increased safety without sacrificing stethoscope function. We recommend that the CDC consider the research regarding stethoscope hygiene and effective solutions to contemporize this guidance and elevate stethoscope hygiene to that of the hands, by requiring stethoscope disinfection or change of disposable barrier between every patient encounter.","Kalra, Sarathi; Amin, Alpesh; Albert, Nancy; Cadwell, Cindy; Edmonson, Cole; Gaynes, Robert; Hand, Mary; Marinella, Mark; Morely, Colleen; Sieck, Sandra; Vasudevan, Rajiv S",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,427

OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes associated with excipient skin testing after a reported allergic reaction to the first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: We identified a consecutive sample of patients with reported allergic reactions after the first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine who underwent allergy assessment with skin testing to polyethylene glycol (PEG) and, when appropriate, polysorbate 80. Skin testing results in conjunction with clinical phenotyping of the first-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine reaction guided second-dose vaccination recommendation. Second-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine reactions were assessed. RESULTS: Eighty patients with reported first-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine allergic reactions (n = 65; 81% immediate onset) underwent excipient skin testing. Of those, 14 (18%) had positive skin tests to PEG (n = 5) and/or polysorbate 80 (n = 12). Skin testing result did not affect tolerance of the second dose in patients with immediate or delayed reactions. Of the 70 patients who received the second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose (88%), 62 had either no reaction or a mild reaction managed with antihistamines (89%), but 2 patients required epinephrine treatment. Three patients with positive PEG-3350 intradermal (methylprednisolone) testing tolerated second-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Refresh Tears caused nonspecific skin irritation. CONCLUSIONS: Most individuals with a reported allergic reaction to the first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, regardless of skin test result, received the second dose safely. More data are needed on the value of skin prick testing to PEG (MiraLAX) in evaluating patients with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine anaphylaxis. Refresh Tears should not be used for skin testing.","Wolfson, Anna R; Robinson, Lacey B; Li, Lily; McMahon, Aubree E; Cogan, Amelia S; Fu, Xiaoqing; Wickner, Paige; Samarakoon, Upeka; Saff, Rebecca R; Blumenthal, Kimberly G; Banerji, Aleena",J.

239689,Achieving American Nurses Credentialing Center Magnet® Designation With a Virtual Site Visit,2020,"The acceleration of product development requires clear and systematic project management as a guideline and reference point for engineers from different backgrounds, different organizations and different cultures. Project management has therefore been part of the education of mechanical engineers for years. During the last years product development projects evolved the need for agile and lean management methods. So concepts originated from software development influence the organization of even pure mechanical engineering departments. Multidisciplinary product development projects can nowadays hardly do without scrum. Now, the COVID-19 pandemic suddenly transformed student cohorts from local classrooms into distributed teams from one day to the other. The basics of engineering project management could neither be explained nor trained in classroom teaching. Accidental discussions did not take place. Asking was difficult and feedback loops could not be closed. Exams in presence could not be carried out and has been transformed into some kind of homework assignment. The individual student got out of focus and learning success began to slip away. This contribution provides a case study how the sudden restrictions led to the implementation of a digital and virtual concept in teaching project management for mechanical engineering studies. It shows how classic project management is taught in a blended lecture set-up with asynchronous videos, synchronous web meetings and project based learning in a bachelor course. It further shows how agile project management is used to keep the close contact between student and teacher during student thesis. It also explains how scrum is applied to organize self-learning in a master course. The focus of this contribution is on the implementation of known methods with digital project management and communication tools. Finally, an attempt is made to compare the previous classroom teaching and the new digital teaching. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

241102,Introducing telehealth skills into the Doctor of Nursing Practice curriculum,2020,"AIMS: Myocardial injury is frequently observed in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Different cardiac abnormalities have been reported during the acute COVID-19 phase, ranging from infra-clinic elevations of myocardial necrosis biomarkers to acute cardiac dysfunction and myocarditis. There is limited information on late cardiac sequelae in patients who have recovered from acute COVID-19 illness. We aimed to document the presence and quantify the extent of myocardial functional alterations in patients hospitalized 6 months earlier for COVID-19 infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective echocardiographic evaluation of 48 patients (mean age 58 ± 13 years, 69% male) hospitalized 6 ± 1 month earlier for a laboratory-confirmed and symptomatic COVID-19. Thirty-two (66.6%) had pre-existing cardiovascular risks factors (systemic hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidaemia), and three patients (6.2%) had a known prior myocardial infarction. Sixteen patients (33.3%) experienced myocardial injury during the index COVID-19 hospitalization as identified by a rise in cardiac troponin levels. Six months later, 60.4% of patients still reported clinical symptoms including exercise dyspnoea for 56%. Echocardiographic measurements under resting conditions were not different between patients with versus without myocardial injury during the acute COVID-19 phase. In contrast, low-level exercise (25W for 3 min) induced a significant increase in the average E/e' ratio (10.1 ± 4.3 vs. 7.3 ± 11.5, P = 0.01) and the systolic pulmonary artery pressure (33.4 ± 7.8 vs. 25.6 ± 5.3 mmHg, P = 0.02) in patients with myocardial injury during the acute COVID-19 phase. Sensitivity analyses showed that these alterations of left ventricular diastolic markers were observed regardless of whether of cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiac diseases indicating SARS-CoV-2 infection as a primary cause. CONCLUSIONS: Six months after the acute COVID-19 phase, significant cardiac diastolic abnormalities are observed in patients who experienced myocardial injury but not in patients without cardiac involvement.","Fayol, Antoine; Livrozet, Marine; Boutouyrie, Pierre; Khettab, Hakim; Betton, Maureen; Tea, Victoria; Blanchard, Anne; Bruno, Rosa-Maria; Hulot, Jean-Sébastien",ESC Heart Fail,,427

While conventional laboratory tests such as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), serology tests, and chest computerized tomography (CT) scan allow diagnosis of COVID-19, these tests are time-consuming and laborious, and are limited in resource-limited settings or developing countries. Point-of-care (POC) biosensors such as chip-based and paper-based biosensors are typically rapid, portable, cost-effective, and user-friendly, which can be used for COVID-19 in remote settings. The escalating demand for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 presents a strong need for a timely and comprehensive review on the POC biosensors for COVID-19 that meet ASSURED criteria: Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and Robust, Equipment-free, and Deliverable to end users. In the present review, we discuss the importance of rapid and early diagnosis of COVID-19 and pathogenesis of COVID-19 along with the key diagnostic biomarkers. We critically review the most recent advances in POC biosensors which show great promise for the detection of COVID-19 based on three main categories: chip-based biosensors, paper-based biosensors, and other biosensors. We subsequently discuss the key benefits of these biosensors and their use for the detection of antigen, antibody, and viral nucleic acids. The commercial POC biosensors for COVID-19 are critically compared. Finally, we discuss the key challenges and future perspectives of developing emerging POC biosensors for COVID-19. This review would be very useful for guiding strategies for developing and commercializing rapid POC tests to manage the spread of infections.Graphical abstract.","Rasmi, Yousef; Li, Xiaokang; Khan, Johra; Ozer, Tugba; Choi, Jane Ru",Anal. bioanal. chem,,427

242861,"Introduction to the Presidential Special Issue ""Multiple Identities and Scholarship in International Studies""",2021,"The highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.351 that first emerged in South Africa with triple mutations (N501Y, K417N, and E484K) is globally worrisome. It is known that N501Y and E484K can enhance binding between the coronavirus receptor domain (RBD) and human ACE2. However, the K417N mutation appears to be unfavorable as it removes one interfacial salt bridge. Here, we show that despite the decrease in binding affinity (1.48 kcal/mol) between RBD and ACE2, the K417N mutation abolishes a buried interfacial salt bridge between the RBD and neutralizing antibody CB6. This substantially reduces their binding energy by 9.59 kcal/mol, thus facilitating the process by which the variant efficiently eludes CB6 (including many other antibodies). Our theoretical predictions agree with existing experimental findings. Harnessing the revealed molecular mechanisms makes it possible to redesign therapeutic antibodies, thus making them more efficacious.","Luan, Binquan; Huynh, Tien",J. med. chem,,427
242862,"Introduction to the Presidential Special Issue ""Multiple Identities and Scholarship in International Studies""",2021,"We translate a closed text that is known in advance and available in many languages into a new and severely low resource language. Most human translation efforts adopt a portion-based approach to translate consecutive pages/chapters in order, which may not suit machine translation. We compare the portion-based approach that optimizes coherence of the text locally with the random sampling approach that increases coverage of the text globally. Our results show that the random sampling approach performs better. When training on a seed corpus of ~1,000 lines from the Bible and testing on the rest of the Bible (~30,000 lines), random sampling gives a performance gain of +11.0 BLEU using English as a simulated low resource language, and +4.9 BLEU using Eastern Pokomchi, a Mayan language. Furthermore, we compare three ways of updating machine translation models with increasing amount of human post-edited data through iterations. We find that adding newly post-edited data to training after vocabulary update without self-supervision performs the best. We propose an algorithm for human and machine to work together seamlessly to translate a closed text into a severely low resource language.","Zhou, Zhong; Waibel, Alex",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07127v1.pdf,427

243052,Will life ever be the same again?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric events are often associated with viral pandemics. The unexpected turn of events the world over since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic may serve as stressors which can trigger or worsen mental disorders particularly psychosis. There is little or no reports about acute psychosis on the background of this current global pandemic particularly in the African context. The aim of this article describes a case series of acute schizophrenia-like disorder with COVID-19 related psychotic themes in the context of the current pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a case series of 2 patients with first episode psychotic illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both patients presented at the mental health outpatient clinic of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. RESULTS: Two patients with no previous history of mental illness presented with COVID-19 delusional themes and odd behaviours. Mental state examination revealed abnormalities in behaviour, thought system, perception and cognition. ICD10 diagnosis of Acute and Transient Psychotic disorder was made in both patients. There were no abnormal physical health findings and symptoms resolved with the use of antipsychotics. CONCLUSION: Information on the COVID-19 pandemic may influence the content of psychotic experiences among the general population. A high index of suspicion and acute services are important to ensure prompt intervention and promotion of community mental health. Clinicians need to be well informed to be able to identify what deviates from the norm, and to be able to provide prompt intervention.","Oloniniyi, I. O.; Ibigbami, O. I.; Amiola, A.; Esan, O.

244538,Urgency towards economic diversification through effective reforms in caspian basin,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Humans avoid overheating through physiological and behavioral mechanisms. However, elite athletes, industrial workers, and military personnel, driven by the tasks at hand, may choose to continue working and face an increased risk of exertional heat illness (EHI). We wanted to examine the efficacy of a new core temperature (Tcr) estimation algorithm in assessing EHI risk. APPROACH: Physiological responses of 21 male Royal Marines recruits (age 21±2 y, height 1.79±0.05 m, weight 80.5±7.2 kg) were collected during a physically-demanding criterion road march (14.5 km in 90 min with a 9.6 kg load; air temperature 16°C, relative humidity &#8805; 84%). Measured Tcr (thermometer pill) and estimated Tcr (ECTempTM Tcr-est) were compared. MAIN RESULTS: Measured Tcr either increased to an asymptote Tcr < 39.5°C (WARM; n=11), or progressively increased to Tcr > 40.0°C (HOT; n=10). In the HOT group, Tcr-est reflected measured Tcr up to Tcr = 40.0°C (Bias = -0.10 ± 0.37°C, root mean square error = 0.37 ± 0.13°C). In the WARM group, Tcr-est overestimated Tcr (Bias = 0.34 ± 0.40°C) and was higher from mid-point to end. A logistic regression (Skin temperature approximate entropy and mean heart rate) was able to predict group membership (95% accuracy) at 20 minutes, allowing a WARM group ECTemp(TM) correction factor (corrected Bias=0.00 ± 0.29°C). SIGNIFICANCE: The Tcr-est successfully tracked Tcr in the HOT group with high risk of exertional heat illness (EHI) (40% incidence). Skin temperature complexity shows promise as a non-invasive means of insight into the state of thermoregulatory control mechanisms.","Buller, Mark J; Davey, Trish; Fallowfield, Joanne; Montain, Scott; Hoyt, Reed; Delves, Simon",Physiol. meas,,427

The goal of this study was to describe stockpiling behaviour in response to COVID-19 and investigate individual predictors of stockpiling. METHODS: Workers (N = 363, 54.72% male, 44.65% female, 0.63% other; Mage = 38.41, SD = 12.48, range = 18-78) were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk and completed a survey about their stockpiling of 13 items, as well as behaviours and opinions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and their political affiliation. RESULTS: Participants stockpiled, on average, approximately 6 items, and toilet paper was the item most commonly procured. Approximately 25% of the sample acquired a gun or other weapon in response to the pandemic and approximately 20% of participants stockpiled gold or other precious metals. Stockpiling was more commonly observed among individuals who were more conservative, worried more about the pandemic, and social distanced less.

As yet there are no reports of transfusion transmission of COVID-19. Haemovigilance findings within a three-month surveillance period during the new coronavirus pandemic are presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Due to great demand and shortage, blood sessions in outpatient facilities were organized during the high prevalence period of COVID-19, alongside a national plan to monitor the evolving public health situation by random molecular screening of high-risk groups of the population. Haemovigilance protocols were implemented as well as surveillance for any COVID-19 case reported post-transfusion. A 14-day quarantine and follow-up molecular and antibody testing of any COVID-19 positive case was obligatory. RESULTS: Post-donation, post-transfusion information and molecular testing of swab samples collected from three asymptomatic donors at risk for COVID-19, revealed the case of an immunosupressed patient who had been transfused with whole blood derived platelets from a donor subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19. The recipient exhibited no symptoms of the disease. Molecular and antibody testing results were negative. CONCLUSION: Haemovigilance provided information supporting the absence of transfusion transmission of COVID-19, thus strengthening the hypothesis that, even if it cannot yet be definitively ruled out, COVID-19 is not transmitted through blood transfusion. As of early June 2020, a perfect test does not exist, therefore haemovigilance along with the implementation of strict proactive measures is crucial to identify eluding asymptomatic individuals and ensure blood safety during the pandemic.","Politis, C; Papadaki, M; Politi, L; Kourti, G; Richardson, C; Asariotou, M; Tsakris, A; Mentis, A",Transfus. clin. biol,,427

MATERIALS AND METHODS: COVID-19 death rates from 30 industrialized countries were analysed using linear regression models. Covariates modelled population density, the age structure of the population, obesity, population health, per capita gross domestic product (GDP), ethnic diversity, national temperature and the delay in the government imposing virus control measures. RESULTS: The multivariable regression model explained 63% of the inter-country variation in COVID-19 death rates. The initial model was optimized using stepwise selection. In descending order of absolute size of model coefficient, the covariates in the optimized model were the obesity rate, the hypertension rate, population density, life expectancy, the percentage of the population aged older than 65 years, the percentage of the population aged younger than 15 years, the diabetes rate, the delay in imposing national COVID-19 control measures, per capita GDP and mean temperature (with a negative coefficient indicating an association between higher national temperatures and lower death rates). CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of the inter-country variation in COVID-19 death rates can be explained by differences in obesity rates, population health, population densities, age demographics, delays in imposing national virus control measures, per capita GDP and climate. Some of the unexplained variation is probably attributable to inter-country differences in the definition of a COVID-19 death and in the completeness of the recording of COVID-19 deaths.","Gardiner, Julian; Oben, Jude; Sutcliffe, Alastair",Diabetes obes. metab,,427

Due to vindesine unavailability, we assessed the safety and efficacy of replacing vindesine with vincristine in a modified R-ACVBP protocol (mR-ACVBP). METHODS: This is a retrospective study including all consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL who received first-line mR-ACVBP. Vindesine was replaced with vincristine 1.5 mg on days 1 and 5 of each cycle. Responders continued with published R-ACVBP consolidation. Patients with inadequate response on interim imaging were offered consolidative autologous stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: We identified 56 patients with DLBCL, with a median age of 41 years (range, 21-67). Thirty-seven (66%) patients had an age-adjusted International Prognostic Index of &#8805; 2. Complete response was achieved in 41 (80%) patients and partial response in 6 (12%). The most common adverse events during induction were anemia (91%), febrile neutropenia (64%; grade 4 in 46%), thrombocytopenia (39%), and mucositis (21%). Peripheral neuropathy was encountered in 7 (12%) patients (grade 3; n = 1). Two deaths from septic shock were reported in patients with initial poor performance status. After a median follow-up of 17 months, the 2-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 86% and 87%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The replacement of vindesine with vincristine in mR-ACVBP seems feasible, with manageable adverse events and excellent 2-year progression-free survival. These data need validation in larger prospective trials.","El Sayed, Rola; El Darsa, Haidar; Kort, Jeries; Al Chami, Farouk; Ibrahim, Ali; Charafeddine, Maya; Bazarbachi, Ali; Abou Dalle, Iman; El Cheikh, Jean",Clin. lymphoma myeloma leuk.

249795,Federalism in Pandemic Prevention and Response,2020,"INTRODUCTION: We describe a new service model, the Orthopaedic Assessment Unit (OAU), designed to provide care for trauma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients without COVID-19 symptoms and isolated musculoskeletal injuries were redirected to the OAU. METHODS: We prospectively reviewed patients throughput during the peak of the global pandemic (7 May 2020 to 7 June 2020) and compared with our historic service provision (7 May 2019 to 7 June 2019). The Mann-Whitney and Fisher Exact tests were used to test the statistical significance of data. RESULTS: A total of 1,147 patients were seen, with peak attendances between 11am and 2pm; 96% of all referrals were seen within 4h. The majority of patients were seen by orthopaedic registrars (52%) and nurse practitioners (44%). The majority of patients suffered from sprains and strains (39%), followed by fractures (22%) and wounds (20%); 73% of patients were discharged on the same day, 15% given follow up, 8% underwent surgery and 3% were admitted but did not undergo surgery. Our volume of trauma admissions and theatre cases decreased by 22% and 17%, respectively (p=0.058; 0.139). There was a significant reduction of virtual fracture clinic referrals after reconfiguration of services (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rapid implementation of a specialist OAU during a pandemic can provide early definitive trauma care while exceeding national waiting time standards. The fall in trauma attendances was lower than anticipated. The retention of orthopaedic staff in the department to staff the unit and maintain a high standard of care is imperative.","Lim, J W; Rehman, H; Gaba, S; Sargeant, H; Stevenson, I M; Boddie, D E",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,,427

Whether the risk extends postdischarge has been controversial. Our prospective registry included consecutive patients with COVID-19 hospitalized within our multihospital system from 1 March to 31 May 2020. We captured demographics, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, medications, postdischarge thromboprophylaxis, and 90-day outcomes. Data from electronic health records, health informatics exchange, radiology database, and telephonic follow-up were merged. Primary outcome was a composite of adjudicated VTE, ATE, and all-cause mortality (ACM). Principal safety outcome was major bleeding (MB). Among 4906 patients (53.7% male), mean age was 61.7 years. Comorbidities included hypertension (38.6%), diabetes (25.1%), obesity (18.9%), and cancer history (13.1%). Postdischarge thromboprophylaxis was prescribed in 13.2%. VTE rate was 1.55%; ATE, 1.71%; &#913;CM, 4.83%; and MB, 1.73%.

In this work, the applications of human-robot interaction are reviewed. These applications could be industrial, medical, agricultural, servical, and educational. HRI can be found in industrial applications in picking and placing in the production lines, welding processes, parts assembly, and painting. Assistive robotics are one from the highest profile areas in HRI. For people with the physical and the mental challenges, the robots can provide the opportunity of interaction and therapy. In addition, HRI can be widely applied in hospitals. Nowadays, HRI is very important for facing the new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In agriculture, the cooperation between human and the robot helps with many tasks including harvesting, seeding, fertilizing, spraying, weed detection, hauling, and mowing. HRI can also be found in other applications such as education, mining, and home use.","Sharkawy, Abdel-Nasser",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00928v1.pdf,427

254593,A pandemic response to home delivery for ambulatory ECG monitoring: Development and validation,2020,"Researchers have begun exploring the impact of societal culture on Covid-19 outcomes (morbidity and mortality). However, emerging findings need integration with prior literature on societal culture and infectious diseases. Moreover, accumulation of knowledge warrants an update while overcoming certain limitations of samples as well as construct validity concerns. Accordingly, hypotheses are derived based on extant evidence proposing the impact of certain cultural practices on Covid-19 outcomes across countries. These hypotheses are tested using the cultural practice scores from GLOBE studies after controlling for certain covariates identified in literature. Multiple regression results reveal that societal culture significantly explains Covid-19 outcomes beyond the explanation due to control variables. Specifically, power distance and institutional collectivism show negative association with both Covid-19 morbidity and mortality. Additionally, performance orientation shows negative association with Covid-19 morbidity. It appears that power distance may ensure conformity to prescribed behaviors and features of performance orientation may facilitate swift and effective containment of Covid-19 cases. The significance of institutional collectivism?but not in-group collectivism?emerging as the form of collectivism showing negative association with Covid-19 outcomes is also discussed.","Kumar, Rajiv",Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology,,427

Psychological well-being was prospectively assessed during COVID-19 lockdown in Italy in a PCD population. METHODS: we recruited 27 PCD patients and 27 healthy controls. To assess psychological well-being, psychological general well-being index and parenting stress index-short questionnaires were administered to participants &#8805;15 years-old and to mothers of participants <15 years-old, respectively. The PCD exacerbations since outbreak onset and frequency of quarantine weekly chest physiotherapy were compared to the same period of 2019. OUTCOMES: 70% of PCD mothers and 90% of PCD patients did not show parental stress levels or distress levels, respectively, and these groups showed no significant difference in stress compared to controls. The PCD pulmonary exacerbations occurred less frequently and weekly chest physiotherapy sessions significantly increased compared to the same period during 2019 (p < 0.05). INTERPRETATION: During COVID-19 quarantine, a PCD population showed psychological well-being. Low exacerbation rate, explained by lower infectious exposure or improved compliance to chest physiotherapy, likely contributed to psychological well-being. Evaluating psychological burden and parental stress is a valuable tool for measuring the emotional impact of PCD and improving PCD medical care.","Riccio, Maria Pia; Borrelli, Melissa; Fioretti, Maria Teresa; Del Bene, Margherita; Bravaccio, Carmela; Poeta, Marco; Santamaria, Francesca",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,427

256025,Difference between binomial proportions using Newcombe’s method with multiple imputation for incomplete data,2021,"BACKGROUND: This study reports the experience of a multi-disciplinary healthcare team (PACT) in shifting rapidly from face-to-face care to using video conferencing (VC) for clinical and collaborative services during the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. PACT focuses on the transitional phase between hospital and primary care for elderly patients in Northern Norway with complex and long-term needs (CLN). PACT emphasises a person-centred care approach whereby the sharing of power and the patient's response to ""What matters to you?"" drives care decisions. However, during the Covid-19 (novel coronavirus) pandemic, VC was the only option for assessing, planning, coordinating and performing treatment and care. This study explores how PACT managed to maintain person-centred care under these conditions. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we address the following research questions: How does PACT preserve a person-centred focus on care for persons with CLN in care services when VC becomes the main mode of clinical communication due to the social distancing measures during the Covid-19 pandemic? What are the challenges and opportunities for healthcare personnel in PACT when it is necessary to make a rapid transfer from face-to-face care to video meetings? METHODS: This case study takes a qualitative approach based on four semi-structured focus group interviews carried out in May and June 2020 with 19 PACT members and leaders. RESULTS: The case study illustrates that VC is a good solution for many persons with CLN and generates new opportunities for interaction between patients and healthcare personnel. Persons with CLN are a heterogeneous group, and for many patients with reduced cognitive capacity and/or hearing and seeing disabilities, the use of VC was challenging and required support from relatives or healthcare personnel. The study shows that using VC offered an opportunity to use healthcare personnel more efficiently, reduce travelling time for patients and improve the information exchange between healthcare levels. This suggests that the integration of VC contributed to the preservation of the person-centred focus on care during the Covid-19 pandemic. There was an overall agreement in PACT that face-to-face care needed to be at the core of the person-centred care approach; the main use of VC was to support follow-up and coordination. CONCLUSIONS: The Covid-19 pandemic and the rapid adoption of digital care has generated a unique opportunity to continue developing a health service to not only preserve but also improve the person-centred care approach for persons with CLN. This creates demand for overall agreements, including guidelines and procedures for how and when VC is a useful supplement to face-to-face treatment and care. Implementing VC in clinical practice generates a need for systematic training and familiarisation with the equipment and technology, as well as for an extensive support organisation. VC can then contribute to making healthcare services better prepared for future scenarios.","Silsand, Line; Severinsen, Gro-Hilde; Berntsen, Gro",,,427

We aimed to determine the symptoms most commonly associated with a positive result for a SARS-CoV-2 swab among community-based children. METHODS: We conducted an observational study among children tested and followed for SARS-CoV-2 infection using nasal, nasopharyngeal, throat or other (e.g., nasopharyngeal aspirate or tracheal secretions, or unknown) swabs between Apr. 13 and Sept. 30, 2020, in Alberta. We calculated positive likelihood ratios (LRs) for self-reported symptoms and a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab result in the entire cohort and in 3 sensitivity analyses: all children with at least 1 symptom, all children tested because of contact tracing whether they were symptomatic or not and all children 5 years of age or older. RESULTS: We analyzed results for 2463 children who underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection; 1987 children had a positive result and 476 had a negative result. Of children with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, 714 (35.9%) reported being asymptomatic. Although cough (24.5%) and rhinorrhea (19.3%) were 2 of the most common symptoms among children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were also common among those with negative test results and were not predictive of a positive test (positive LR 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81-1.14, and 0.87, 95% CI 0.72-1.06, respectively). Anosmia/ageusia (positive LR 7.33, 95% CI 3.03-17.76), nausea/vomiting (positive LR 5.51, 95% CI 1.74-17.43), headache (positive LR 2.49, 95% CI 1.74-3.57) and fever (positive LR 1.68, 95% CI 1.34-2.11) were the symptoms most predictive of a positive result for a SARSCoV-2 swab. The positive LR for the combination of anosmia/ageusia, nausea/vomiting and headache was 65.92 (95% CI 49.48-91.92). INTERPRETATION: About two-thirds of the children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection reported symptoms. The symptoms most strongly associated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab result were anosmia/ageusia, nausea/vomiting, headache and fever.","King, James A; Whitten, Tara A; Bakal, Jeffrey A; McAlister, Finlay A",CMAJ,,427

METHODS: Weekly total screening mammograms performed throughout 2019 (baseline year) and 2020 (COVID-19-impacted year) were compared. Demographic and clinical characteristics, including age, race, ethnicity, breast density, breast cancer history, insurance status, imaging facility type used, and need for interpreter, were compared between patients imaged from March 16 to October 31 in 2019 (baseline cohort) and 2020 (COVID-19-impacted cohort). Census data and an online map service were used to impute socioeconomic variables and calculate travel times for each patient. Logistic regression was used to identify patient characteristics associated with a lower likelihood of returning for screening after COVID-19-related closures. RESULTS: The year-over-year cumulative difference in screening mammogram volumes peaked in week 21, with 2962 fewer exams in the COVID-19-impacted year. By week 47, this deficit had reduced by 49.4% to 1498. A lower likelihood of returning for screening after COVID-19-related closures was independently associated with younger age (odds ratio (OR) 0.78, p < 0.001), residence in a higher poverty area (OR 0.991, p = 0.014), lack of health insurance (OR 0.65, p = 0.007), need for an interpreter (OR 0.68, p = 0.029), longer travel time (OR 0.998, p < 0.001), and utilization of mobile mammography services (OR 0.27, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Several patient factors are associated with a lower likelihood of returning for screening mammography after COVID-19-related closures. Knowledge of these factors can guide targeted outreach to vulnerable patients to facilitate breast cancer screening.","Miller, Matthew M; Meneveau, Max O; Rochman, Carrie M; Schroen, Anneke T; Lattimore, Courtney M; Gaspard, Patricia A; Cubbage, Richard S; Showalter, Shayna L",Breast cancer res. treat,,427
257664,2020: The Year in Review,2020,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has erupted into a global pandemic that has led to tens of millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. The development of therapeutics to treat infection or as prophylactics to halt viral transmission and spread is urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 relies on structural rearrangements within a spike (S) glycoprotein to mediate fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. Here, we describe the development of a lipopeptide that is derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) domain of SARS-CoV-2 S that potently inhibits infection by SARS-CoV-2. The lipopeptide inhibits cell-cell fusion mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S and blocks infection by live SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cell monolayers more effectively than previously described lipopeptides. The SARS-CoV-2 lipopeptide exhibits broad-spectrum activity by inhibiting cell-cell fusion mediated by SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and blocking infection by live MERS-CoV in cell monolayers. We also show that the SARS-CoV-2 HRC-derived lipopeptide potently blocks the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, an ex vivo model designed to mimic respiratory viral propagation in humans. While viral spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection was widespread in untreated airways, those treated with SARS-CoV-2 HRC lipopeptide showed no detectable evidence of viral spread. These data provide a framework for the development of peptide therapeutics for the treatment of or prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 as well as other coronaviruses.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, continues to spread globally, placing strain on health care systems and resulting in rapidly increasing numbers of cases and mortalities. Despite the growing need for medical intervention, no FDA-approved vaccines are yet available, and treatment has been limited to supportive therapy for the alleviation of symptoms. Entry inhibitors could fill the important role of preventing initial infection and preventing spread. Here, we describe the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a lipopeptide that is derived from the HRC domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein that potently inhibits fusion mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein and blocks infection by live SARS-CoV-2 in both cell monolayers (in vitro) and human airway tissues (ex vivo). Our results highlight the SARS-CoV-2 HRC-derived lipopeptide as a promising therapeutic candidate for SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Outlaw, Victor K; Bovier, Francesca T; Mears, Megan C; Cajimat, Maria N; Zhu, Yun; Lin, Michelle J; Addetia, Amin; Lieberman, Nicole A P; Peddu, Vikas; Xie, Xuping; Shi, Pei-Yong; Greninger, Alexander L; Gellman, Samuel H; Bente, Dennis A; Moscona, Anne; Porotto, Matteo",mBio (Online),,427

Although recent deep learning-based approaches achieved better performance than molecular docking, existing models often neglect certain aspects of the intermolecular information, hindering the performance of prediction. We recognize this problem and propose a novel approach named Intermolecular Graph Transformer (IGT) that employs a dedicated attention mechanism to model intermolecular information with a three-way Transformer-based architecture. IGT outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 9.1% and 20.5% over the second best for binding activity and binding pose prediction respectively, and shows superior generalization ability to unseen receptor proteins. Furthermore, IGT exhibits promising drug screening ability against SARS-CoV-2 by identifying 83.1% active drugs that have been validated by wet-lab experiments with near-native predicted binding poses.","Liu, Siyuan; Wang, Yusong; Wang, Tong; Deng, Yifan; He, Liang; Shao, Bin; Yin, Jian; Zheng, Nanning; Liu, Tie-Yan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07347v2.pdf,427

260307,Studying social awareness of physical distancing in mitigating COVID-19 transmission,2020,"Facing the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing outbreaks among farmworkers and food processing workers across the nation, the Oregon Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OR OSHA) issued temporary regulations, in contrast to optional recommendations, in late spring. These regulations aimed to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission among farmworkers, but made compromises that may fail to reduce the risk of further outbreaks among Oregon's agricultural workers, particularly those living in agricultural labor housing. Instead of considering the scientific literature that called for attention to space and length of time for social distancing among unrelated persons in indoor areas, the agency accepted the 6-foot social distancing rule of thumb and allowed even shorter distances between beds with the installation of plastic or plywood barriers. The 6-foot distance (or less with a barrier) between people sleeping next to each other in poorly ventilated housing has proved disastrous. Additionally, testing for migrant and seasonal farmworkers is neither uniform nor thorough, and little data have been collected to assess the success of existing testing efforts. New regulations must be adopted for farm labor housing that limit occupancy to at most two unrelated individuals for a room of 200 square feet; include expanded specification on the provision of fresh air in shared living spaces; and support increased access to testing, surveillance testing, and alternative safe housing at labor housing sites for identified cases.","Accorsi, Emma K; Samples, Julie; McCauley, Linda A; Shadbeh, Nargess",J Agromedicine,,427

This chapter will review SARS-CoV-2 associated cutaneous findings, including incidence and relevance to the pediatric population. RECENT FINDINGS: The most commonly reported cutaneous findings described for COVID-19 in adults and children were chilblains-like lesions, followed by maculopapular eruption, urticarial lesions, vesicular lesions, and livedoid lesions. Children can also present with erythema multiforme (EM)-like lesions and skin findings associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). SUMMARY: There are numerous cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19, some of which are unique to children such as EM-like lesions and skin findings for MIS-C. Livedoid lesions do not commonly occur in the pediatric population. In mild cases, supportive care is indicated, whereas severe cases warrant intensive care and hospitalization.","Sanchez-Flores, Xavier; Huynh, Thy; Huang, Jennifer T",Curr Opin Pediatr,,427

262488,Have the Baltic Countries Run out of Labour Reserves,2020,"Uncertainty is a defining feature of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, because uncertainty is an aversive state, uncertainty reduction theory (URT) holds that employees try to manage it by obtaining information. To date, most evidence for the effectiveness of obtaining information to reduce uncertainty stems from research conducted in relatively stable contexts wherein employees can acquire consistent information. Yet, research on crises and news consumption provides reasons to believe that the potential for information to mitigate uncertainty as specified by URT may break down during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Integrating URT with research on crises and news consumption, we predict that consuming news information during crises-which tends to be distressing, constantly evolving, and inconsistent-will be positively related to uncertainty. This in turn may have negative implications for employee goal progress and creativity; two work outcomes that take on substantial significance in times of uncertainty and the pandemic. We further predict that death anxiety will moderate this relationship, such that the link between employees' news consumption and uncertainty is stronger for those with lower levels of death anxiety, compared to those with higher levels. We test our theorizing via an experience-sampling study with 180 full-time employees, with results providing support for our conceptual model. Our study reveals important theoretical and practical implications regarding information consumption during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

A spatiotemporal analysis using open big data,2021-03-11,"To describe the medium-term ophthalmological findings in patients recovering from COVID-19. Patients recovered from the acute phase of COVID-19 underwent a complete ophthalmological evaluation, including presenting and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), refractometry, biomicroscopy, tonometry, break-up time and Schirmer tests, indirect ophthalmoscopy, color fundus picture, and retinal architecture evaluation using optical coherence tomography. Socio-demographic data and personal medical history were also collected. According to the severity of systemic manifestations, patients were classified into mild-to-moderate, severe, and critical. Sixty-four patients (128 eyes) were evaluated 82 ± 36.4 days after the onset of COVID's symptoms. The mean ± SD duration of hospitalization was 15.0 ± 10.7 days. Seven patients (10.9%) had mild-to-moderate, 33 (51.5%) severe, and 24 (37.5%) critical disease. Median [interquartile ranges (IQR)] presenting visual acuity was 0.1 (0-0.2) and BCVA 0 (0-0.1). Anterior segment biomicroscopy was unremarkable, except for dry eye disease, verified in 10.9% of them. The mean ± SD intraocular pressure (IOP) in critical group (14.16 ± 1.88 mmHg) was significantly higher than in severe group (12.51 ± 2.40 mmHg), both in the right (p 0.02) and left eyes (p 0.038). Among all, 15.6% had diabetic retinopathy, and two patients presented with discrete white-yellowish dots in the posterior pole, leading to hyporreflective changes at retinal pigment epithelium level, outer segment, and ellipsoid layers. The present study identified higher IOP among critical cases, when compared to severe cases, and discrete outer retina changes 80 days after COVID-19 infection.

262812,Decreases in Near-Road NO and NO2 Concentrations during the COVID-19 Pandemic in California,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has exacerbated the longstanding racial/ethnic health disparities in the USA, with a disproportionately negative effect on children of color. This review summarizes recently published studies that describe the clinical epidemiology and racial/ethnic disparities associated with SARS-CoV-2 in children. RECENT FINDINGS: Children with SARS-CoV-2 infections manifest with a wide spectrum of disease. Most are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with fever, gastrointestinal, and/or upper respiratory disease. Some children can progress to develop severe lower respiratory disease or a hyper-inflammatory, Kawasaki-like syndrome leading to cardiovascular shock. Although SARS-CoV-2-related deaths in children are rare, more children died within the first nine months of the pandemic than have died during any influenza season over the last decade.Black and Hispanic children represent less than 41% of the US population but account for three out of every four SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations and deaths in the USA. The drivers of these disparities in children are complex and likely a combination of societal, biological, and behavioral influences. SUMMARY: This pandemic brought to light longstanding health disparities in historically marginalized populations, and minority children have suffered tremendously. It provides an opportunity to understand how a virus hijacked deep-rooted inequities, address these inequities, and work to prevent this outcome in future pandemics/epidemics.","Zirinsky, Elissa; Paintsil, Elijah; Oliveira, Carlos R",Curr Opin Pediatr,,427
263232,Effective nurse leadership in times of crisis,2020,"Objectives: To assess the influence of corticosteroid pulses on 60-day mortality in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: We designed a multicenter retrospective cohort study in three teaching hospitals of Castilla y León, Spain (865,096 people). We selected patients with confirmed COVID-19 and lung involvement with a pO2/FiO2<300, excluding those exposed to immunosuppressors before or during hospitalization, patients terminally ill at admission, or those who died in the first 24 hours. We performed a propensity score matching (PSM) adjusting covariates that modify the probability of being treated. Then, we used a Cox regression model in the PSM group to consider factors affecting mortality. Results: From 2933 patients, 257 fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 124 patients were on corticosteroid pulses (250 mg of methylprednisolone for three days), and 133 were not. 30.3% (37/122) of patients died in the corticosteroid pulse group and 42.9% (57/133) in the nonexposed cohort. These differences (12.6%, 95% CI [8·54-16.65]) were statically significant (log-rank 4.72, p = 0, 03). We performed PSM using the exact method. Mortality differences remained in the PSM group (log-rank 5.31, p = 0.021) and were still significant after a Cox regression model (HR for corticosteroid pulses 0.561; p = 0.039). Conclusions: This study provides evidence about treatment with corticosteroid pulses in severe COVID-19 that might significantly reduce mortality. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria with that selection process set a reliable frame to compare mortality in both the exposed and nonexposed groups.","Cusacovich, Ivan; Aparisi, Álvaro; Marcos, Miguel; Ybarra-Falcón, Cristina; Iglesias-Echevarria, Carolina; Lopez-Veloso, Maria; Barraza-Vengoechea, Julio; Dueñas, Carlos; Juarros Martínez, Santiago Antonio; Rodríguez-Alonso, Beatriz; Martín-Oterino, José-Ángel; Montero-Baladia, Miguel; Moralejo, Leticia; Andaluz-Ojeda, David; Gonzalez-Fuentes, Roberto",Mediators Inflamm,,427

264860,"An open-sourced, web-based application to analyze weekly excess mortality based on the Short-term Mortality Fluctuations data series",2021,"Significant evidence has accumulated to support the hypothesis that hippocampal region CA1 operates as an associative mismatch detector (e.g., Hasselmo et al., 1995; Lörincz & Buzsáki, 2000; Lisman & Otmakhova, 2001; Vinogradova, 2001; Meeter et al., 2004; Lisman & Grace, 2005; Kumaran & Maguire, 2007; Duncan et al., 2009; Schiffer et al., 2012). CA1 compares predictive synaptic signals from CA3 with synaptic signals from EC3, which reflect actual sensory inputs. The new CA1 pyramidal model presented here shows that the distal-proximal segregation of synaptic inputs from EC3 versus CA3, along with other biophysical features, enable such pyramids to serve as comparators that switch output encoding from a brief burst, for a match, to prolonged tonic spiking, for a mismatch. By including often-overlooked features of CA1 pyramidal neurons, this new model allows simulation of pharmacological effects that can eliminate either the match (phasic mode) response or the mismatch (tonic mode) response. These simulations reveal that dysfunctions can arise from either too much or too little ACh stimulation of the muscarinic receptors that control KCNQ channels. Additionally, a dysfunction caused by administration of an NMDA antagonist could be rescued by simultaneous administration of a KCNQ channel agonist, such as retigabine.","Berteau, Stefan; Bullock, Daniel",J. neurophysiol,,427

Participants (314 higher education sports and music students) answered questions about measure of flow, satisfaction with life, satisfaction with studying, positive and negative affect, and COVID-19 impact. The results revealed differences in eight flow dimensions and a global flow score in favor of sports students. Differences were also found in affect: sports students experienced more positive affect and less negative affect than musicians. However, there were no significant differences with regard to satisfaction with life or satisfaction with study, and music and sports students perceived the COVID-19 impact equally. Gender differences were found for three flow dimensions and the global flow score (female students experienced flow less frequently than males) and satisfaction with studying (higher scores for female students). However, no gender differences were detected for satisfaction with life, positive and negative affect, or COVID-19 impact. The results of regression analyses showed that satisfaction with life and studying, positive and negative affect, and COVID-19 impact could all be predicted on the basis of flow dimensions.","Habe, Katarina; Biasutti, Michele; Kajtna, Tanja",Think Skills Creat,,427
265309,The Chinese Communist Party and Politic 2019/2020,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the main public health challenges currently facing the world. Because of its high transmissibility, COVID-19 has already caused extensive morbidity and mortality in many countries throughout the world. An accurate estimation of the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 would be beneficial for prevention programs. In light of discrepancies in original research on this issue, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled R0 for COVID-19 in the current outbreak. METHODS: International databases (including Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, and Scopus) were searched to identify studies conducted regarding the R0 of COVID-19. Articles were searched using the following keywords: ""COVID-19"" and ""basic reproduction number"" or ""R0."" The heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I2 index, the Cochran Q test, and T2. A random-effects model was used to estimate R0 in this study. RESULTS: The mean reported R0 in the identified articles was 3.38±1.40, with a range of 1.90 to 6.49. According to the results of the random-effects model, the pooled R0 for COVID-19 was estimated as 3.32 (95% confidence interval, 2.81 to 3.82). According to the results of the meta-regression analysis, the type of model used to estimate R0 did not have a significant effect on heterogeneity among studies (p=0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the estimated R0 for COVID-19, reducing the number of contacts within the population is a necessary step to control the epidemic. The estimated overall R0 was higher than the World Health Organization estimate.","Alimohamadi, Yousef; Taghdir, Maryam; Sepandi, Mojtaba",J Prev Med Public Health,,427
265911,Impact of coronavirus pandemic and containment measures on HIV diagnosis,2020,"Bayesian clinical trials allow taking advantage of relevant external information through the elicitation of prior distributions, which influence Bayesian posterior parameter estimates and test decisions. However, incorporation of historical information can have harmful consequences on the trial's frequentist (conditional) operating characteristics in case of inconsistency between prior information and the newly collected data. A compromise between meaningful incorporation of historical information and strict control of frequentist error rates is therefore often sought. Our aim is thus to review and investigate the rationale and consequences of different approaches to relaxing strict frequentist control of error rates from a Bayesian decision-theoretic viewpoint. In particular, we define an integrated risk which incorporates losses arising from testing, estimation, and sampling. A weighted combination of the integrated risk addends arising from testing and estimation allows moving smoothly between these two targets. Furthermore, we explore different possible elicitations of the test error costs, leading to test decisions based either on posterior probabilities, or solely on Bayes factors. Sensitivity analyses are performed following the convention which makes a distinction between the prior of the data-generating process, and the analysis prior adopted to fit the data. Simulation in the case of normal and binomial outcomes and an application to a one-arm proof-of-concept trial, exemplify how such analysis can be conducted to explore sensitivity of the integrated risk, the operating characteristics, and the optimal sample size, to prior-data conflict. Robust analysis prior specifications, which gradually discount potentially conflicting prior information, are also included for comparison. Guidance with respect to cost elicitation, particularly in the context of a Phase II proof-of-concept trial, is provided.","Calderazzo, Silvia; Wiesenfarth, Manuel; Kopp-Schneider, Annette",Biostatistics,,427

We used a prospective Poisson space-time scan statistic (SaTScan) and a Modified Space-Time Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (MST-DBSCAN) to identify both space-time and transmission clusters, and estimated cluster duration, transmission behavior (emergence, growth, reduction, etc.) and relative risk. For each cluster, we computed the number of individuals, the median age of individuals and their viral load. Among the 1684 space-time clusters identified, 457 (27.1%) were significant (p &#8804; 0.05), such that they harbored a higher relative risk of infection within the cluster than compared to regions outside the cluster. Clusters lasted a median of 11 days (IQR 7-13) and included a median of 12 individuals per cluster (IQR 5-20). The majority of significant clusters (n = 260; 56.9%) had at least one person with an extremely high viral load (>1 billion copies/ml). Those clusters were considerably larger (median of 17 infected individuals, p < 0.001) than clusters with individuals showing a viral load below 1 million copies/ml (median of three infected individuals). The highest viral loads were found in clusters with the lowest average age group considered in the investigation, while clusters with the highest average age had low to middle viral load. In 20 significant clusters, the viral load of the three first cases was below 100,000 copies/ml, suggesting that subjects with fewer than 100,000 copies/ml may still be contagious. Notably, the dynamics of transmission clusters made it possible to identify three diffusion zones, which predominantly differentiated between rural and urban areas, the latter being more prone to persistence and expansion, which may result in the emergence of new clusters nearby. The use of geographic information is key for public health decision makers in mitigating the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study suggests that early localization of clusters may help implement targeted protective measures limiting the spread of the virus.","Ladoy, Anaïs; Opota, Onya; Carron, Pierre-Nicolas; Guessous, Idris; Vuilleumier, Séverine; Joost, Stéphane; Greub, Gilbert",Sci Total Environ,,427
267560,Plastic waste associated with the COVID-19 pandemic: Crisis or opportunity?,2021,"Is more novel research always desirable? We develop a model in which knowledge shapes society's policies and guides the search for discoveries. Researchers select a question to study and how intensely to study it. The novelty of the question determines both the value and the difficulty of discovering its answer. We show that the benefits of discoveries are nonmonotone in novelty. Because of a dynamic externality, it can be optimal to incentivize research on more distant questions than myopically optimal to improve the evolution of knowledge. One reason is that the probability of a discovery and the novelty of a question are endogenously linked. They can be complements or substitutes depending on existing knowledge. We also analyze cost reductions and research awards as instruments to incentivize research. We find that while a benefit-maximizing funder's optimal funding mix depends on her budget, distant discoveries can only be incentivized through awards.","Carnehl, Christoph; Schneider, Johannes",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.13434v4.pdf,427
267707,Healthy scepticism,2021,"Amphidiploid fungal Verticillium longisporum strains Vl43 and Vl32 colonize the plant host Brassica napus but differ in their ability to cause disease symptoms. These strains represent two V. longisporum lineages derived from different hybridization events of haploid parental Verticillium strains. Vl32 and Vl43 carry same-sex mating-type genes derived from both parental lineages. Vl32 and Vl43 similarly colonize and penetrate plant roots, but asymptomatic Vl32 proliferation in planta is lower than virulent Vl43. The highly conserved Vl43 and Vl32 genomes include less than 1% unique genes, and the karyotypes of 15 or 16 chromosomes display changed genetic synteny due to substantial genomic reshuffling. A 20 kb Vl43 lineage-specific (LS) region apparently originating from the Verticillium dahliae-related ancestor is specific for symptomatic Vl43 and encodes seven genes, including two putative transcription factors. Either partial or complete deletion of this LS region in Vl43 did not reduce virulence but led to induction of even more severe disease symptoms in rapeseed. This suggests that the LS insertion in the genome of symptomatic V. longisporum Vl43 mediates virulence-reducing functions, limits damage on the host plant, and therefore tames Vl43 from being even more virulent.","Harting, Rebekka; Starke, Jessica; Kusch, Harald; Pöggeler, Stefanie; Maurus, Isabel; Schlüter, Rabea; Landesfeind, Manuel; Bulla, Ingo; Nowrousian, Minou; de Jonge, Ronnie; Stahlhut, Gertrud; Hoff, Katharina J; Aßhauer, Kathrin P; Thürmer, Andrea; Stanke, Mario; Daniel, Rolf; Morgenstern, Burkhard; Thomma, Bart P H J; Kronstad, James W; Braus-Stromeyer, Susanna A; Braus, Gerhard H",Mol. plant pathol,,427

How might we quickly prepare a large number of ambulatory-based clinicians to care for hospitalized patients using the inpatient workflow of the electronic health record (EHR)? OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to create a successful training intervention which prepares ambulatory-based clinicians as they transition to inpatient services. METHODS: We created a training guide with embedded videos that describes the workflow of an inpatient clinician. We delivered this intervention via an e-mail hyperlink, a static hyperlink inside of the EHR, and an on-demand hyperlink within the EHR. RESULTS: In anticipation of the first peak of inpatients with COVID-19 in April 2020, the training manual was accessed 261 times by 167 unique users as clinicians anticipated being called into service. As our institution has not yet needed to deploy ambulatory-based clinicians for inpatient service, usage data of the training document is still pending. CONCLUSION: We intend that our novel implementation of a multimedia, highly accessible onboarding document with access from points inside and outside of the EHR will improve clinician performance and serve as a helpful example to other organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Altman, Richard L; Anstett, Tyler; Simpson, Jennifer R; Del Pino-Jones, Amira; Lin, Chen-Tan; Pell, Jonathan",Appl Clin Inform,,427
269306,Prediction of epidemic trends in covid-19 with mann-kendall and recurrent forecasting-singular spectrum analysis,2021,"COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by the infection of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although the main clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are respiratory, many patients also display acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. Understanding both direct and indirect damage caused to the heart and the vascular system by SARS-CoV-2 infection is necessary to identify optimal clinical care strategies. The homeostasis of the cardiovascular system requires a tight regulation of the gene expression, which is controlled by multiple types of RNA molecules, including RNA encoding proteins (messenger RNAs) (mRNAs) and those lacking protein-coding potential, the noncoding-RNAs. In the last few years, dysregulation of noncoding-RNAs has emerged as a crucial component in the pathophysiology of virtually all cardiovascular diseases. Here we will discuss the potential role of noncoding RNAs in COVID-19 disease mechanisms and their possible use as biomarkers of clinical use.","Greco, S; Madè, A; Gaetano, C; Devaux, Y; Emanueli, C; Martelli, F",J Transl Med,,427
269467,We are not in this together: Psychotherapy and pandemic emotions,2020,"Little evidence on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in people living with HIV (PLWH) is currently available. We reported clinical and viroimmunological data of all HIV-positive patients admitted to our center with COVID-19 from March 1 to May 12, 2020. Overall, five patients were included: all were virologically-suppressed on antiretroviral therapy and CD4+ count was greater than 350 cell/mm3 in all but two patients. Although all patients had evidence of pneumonia on admission, only one developed respiratory failure. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was never detected from nasopharyngeal swabs in two patients, whereas in the others, viral clearance occurred within a maximum of 43 days. Immunoglobulin G production was elicited in all patients and neutralizing antibodies in all but one patient. Specific-T-cell response developed in all patients but was stronger in those with the more severe presentations. Similarly, the highest level of proinflammatory cytokines was found in the only patient experiencing respiratory failure. Despite a mild presentation, patients with more pronounced immunosuppression showed high degrees of both cytokines production and immune activation. Our study did not find an increased risk and severity of COVID-19 in PLWH. Adaptative cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 appeared to correlate to disease severity. The mild clinical picture showed in advanced HIV patients, despite a significant T-cell activation and inflammatory profile, suggests a potential role of HIV-driven immunological dysregulation in avoiding immune-pathogenetic processes. However, other possible explanations, as a protective role of certain antiretroviral drugs, should be considered. Further larger studies are needed to better clarify the impact of HIV infection on COVID-19.","Mondi, Annalisa; Cimini, Eleonora; Colavita, Francesca; Cicalini, Stefania; Pinnetti, Carmela; Matusali, Giulia; Casetti, Rita; Maeurer, Markus; Vergori, Alessandra; Mazzotta, Valentina; Gagliardini, Roberta; De Zottis, Federico; Schininà, Vincenzo; Girardi, Enrico; Puro, Vincenzo; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Vaia, Francesco; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Castilletti, Concetta; Agrati, Chiara; Antinori, Andrea",J Med Virol,,427

269604,Business continuity management: use and approach’s effectiveness,2020,"Deep learning is gaining increasing popularity for spatiotemporal forecasting. However, prior works have mostly focused on point estimates without quantifying the uncertainty of the predictions. In high stakes domains, being able to generate probabilistic forecasts with confidence intervals is critical to risk assessment and decision making. Hence, a systematic study of uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for spatiotemporal forecasting is missing in the community. In this paper, we describe two types of spatiotemporal forecasting problems: regular grid-based and graph-based. Then we analyze UQ methods from both the Bayesian and the frequentist point of view, casting in a unified framework via statistical decision theory. Through extensive experiments on real-world road network traffic, epidemics, and air quality forecasting tasks, we reveal the statistical and computational trade-offs for different UQ methods: Bayesian methods are typically more robust in mean prediction, while confidence levels obtained from frequentist methods provide more extensive coverage over data variations. Computationally, quantile regression type methods are cheaper for a single confidence interval but require re-training for different intervals. Sampling based methods generate samples that can form multiple confidence intervals, albeit at a higher computational cost.","Wu, Dongxia; Gao, Liyao; Xiong, Xinyue; Chinazzi, Matteo; Vespignani, Alessandro; Ma, Yi-An; Yu, Rose",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11982v2.pdf,427

271552,"Adding Space to Disease Models: A Case Study with COVID-19 in Oregon, USA",2021,"BACKGROUND: The burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to characterize a large cohort of COVID-19-positive adult patients with AD and to identify predictors of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. METHODS: A population-based nested case-control study was performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of predictors for COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS: Of 78,073 adult patients with AD, 3618 (4.6%) tested positive for COVID-19. Subclinical COVID-19 infection occurred in 3368 (93.1%) of COVID-19-positive patients, whereas 123 (3.4%), 46 (1.3%), 55 (1.5%), and 26 (0.7%) patients developed a mild, moderate, severe, and critical disease, respectively. Altogether, 250 patients (6.0%) were hospitalized, and 40 patients (1.1%) died because of COVID-19 complications. Coronavirus disease 2019-associated hospitalization was independently associated with the intake of extended courses of systemic corticosteroids (adjusted odds ratio, 1.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.14; P = 0.005). None of AD-related variables independently predicted COVID-19-associated mortality. The presence of comorbid metabolic syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal failure, and depression projected both COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged systemic corticosteroids during the pandemic are associated with increased odds of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and should be avoided in patients with AD.","Kridin, Khalaf; Schonmann, Yochai; Tzur Bitan, Dana; Damiani, Giovanni; Weinstein, Orly; Cohen, Arnon D",Dermatitis,,427
271606,The Price Dynamics Of Hand Sanitizers For COVID-19 In Indonesia: Exponential And Cobweb Forms,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian government took security measures to try to limit infections. Restrictive measures included social distancing, home confinement and the closure of all public structures like gyms and swimming pools. The impact of these limitations on health and lifestyle was inevitably negative. The purpose of this study was to establish the level of physical activity (PA), expressed as energy expenditure (MET-minute/week) in a Southern Italian population before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: An adapted version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short form (IPAQ-SF) was published on the official website of the National Institute of Gastroenterology IRCCS S. de Bellis, Castellana Grotte, Bari, Italy and on several social media in May 2020. RESULTS: Three hundred ten replies (72% women) from Apulia (60%), Calabria (28%), Campania (11%) and Sicily (1%) were included in the study. The COVID-19 lockdown had a negative effect on the vigorous PA intensity level and on walking, but not on the moderate PA intensity level. Additionally, daily time spent sitting down increased by more than 12% during the COVID-19 lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation changed PA behaviors. The decreased energy expenditure (MET-minute/week) during the lockdown had a negative impact in both genders, especially on the young adults and adults' groups.","Franco, Isabella; Bianco, Antonella; Bonfiglio, Caterina; Sorino, Paolo; Mirizzi, Antonella; Campanella, Angelo; Buongiorno, Claudia; Liuzzi, Rosalba; Osella, Alberto R",J Sports Med Phys Fitness,,427

272552,COVID-19 mask waste to energy via thermochemical pathway: Effect of Co-Feeding food waste,2021,"Recently, the first laser spectroscopy measurement of the radioactive RaF molecule has been reported by Ruiz et al. [Nature 581, 396 (2020)]. This and similar molecules are considered to search for the new physics effects. The radium nucleus is of interest as it is octupole-deformed and has close levels of opposite parity. The preparation of such experiments can be simplified if there are reliable theoretical predictions. It is shown that the accurate prediction of the hyperfine structure of the RaF molecule requires to take into account the finite magnetization distribution inside the radium nucleus. For atoms, this effect is known as the Bohr-Weisskopf (BW) effect. Its magnitude depends on the model of the nuclear magnetization distribution which is usually not well known. We show that it is possible to express the nuclear magnetization distribution contribution to the hyperfine structure constant in terms of one magnetization distribution dependent parameter: BW matrix element for 1s-state of the corresponding hydrogen-like ion. This parameter can be extracted from the accurate experimental and theoretical electronic structure data for an ion, atom, or molecule without the explicit treatment of any nuclear magnetization distribution model. This approach can be applied to predict the hyperfine structure of atoms and molecules and allows one to separate the nuclear and electronic correlation problems. It is employed to calculate the finite nuclear magnetization distribution contribution to the hyperfine structure of the 225Ra+ cation and 225RaF molecule. For the ground state of the 225RaF molecule, this contribution achieves 4%.","Skripnikov, Leonid V",J Chem Phys,,427
272553,COVID-19 mask waste to energy via thermochemical pathway: Effect of Co-Feeding food waste,2021,"As climate change advances, communities across the United States are adapting to the increased threat of wildfires, drought, heatwaves, and infectious diseases. Such disasters are expected to become more frequent and severe. Now more than ever, it is crucial to understand how these events amplify existing inequalities, and how to lessen the resulting harms. Differences in human vulnerability to disaster stem from a range of social, economic, historical, and political factors. We argue that given their social status, undocumented Latino/a and Indigenous immigrants are particularly vulnerable to disasters and require special consideration in disaster planning. They are disproportionately affected by racial discrimination, exploitation, economic hardships, less English and Spanish proficiency, and fear of deportation in their everyday lives— their pre-disaster marginalized status. In the case of the Thomas Fire in California's Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, we show that emergency response and recovery efforts ignored their needs. Resources were directed toward privileged individuals, leaving local immigrant rights and environmental justice groups to provide essential services such as language access to emergency information in Spanish and Indigenous tongues; labor protections for farmworkers endangered in the fields; and a private disaster relief fund for undocumented immigrants ineligible for federal aid. The article concludes with preliminary participant observations from the COVID-19 pandemic response in the region, indicating how lessons from the fire have informed official actions. As governments grapple with the increasing severity of disasters, understanding the differential impacts on undocumented immigrants can help improve disaster planning to protect the most vulnerable and stigmatized populations.","Méndez, Michael; Flores-Haro, Genevieve; Zucker, Lucas",Geoforum,,427

While prior studies have advocated the merits of virtual conferences in terms of energy and cost savings, organizers are increasingly facing the prospect of planning and executing them systematically, in order to deliver a rich conference-attending-experience for all participants. Starting from March 2020, tens of conferences have been held virtually. Past conferences have revealed numerous challenges, from budget planning, to selecting the supporting virtual platforms. Among these, two special challenges were identified: 1) how to deliver talks to geo-distributed attendees and 2) how to stimulate social interactions among attendees. These are the two important goals of an academic conference. In this paper, we advocate a mirror program approach for academic conferences. More specifically, the conference program is executed in multiple parallel (mirrored) programs, so that each mirror program can fit a different time zone.

Lymph nodes contained two separate areas of MCL and cHL-like components. Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS)-like cells were accompanied by a prominent histiocyte background. HRS-like cells were CD5- , CD15+ , CD20- , CD30+ , PAX5+ , Bob.1- , Oct2- and EBER+ . The MCL component expressed cyclin D1 and SOX11, whereas cyclin D1 and SOX11 expressions were reduced and lost, respectively, in HRS-like cells. Polymerase chain reaction results showed a single clonal rearrangement of the IGH gene in MCL and cHL-like components. CCND1 break apart fluorescence in situ hybridization showed split signals in both MCL and HRS-like cells, suggesting that MCL and cHL-like components were clonally related. Acquisition of p53 expression and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positivity was seen in HRS-like cells. The patient died of disease progression with elevated hepatobiliary enzymes. The autopsy showed both MCL and cHL-like components around the bile ducts, splenic white pulp and bone marrow.

280161,Affordable housing policies in a post-COVID aftermath,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with severe COVID-19 can develop ventilator-dependent acute hypoxic respiratory failure (VDAHRF), which is associated with a higher mortality rate. We evaluated the clinical course of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and compared them with the patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation. Characteristics of intubated patients who were successfully weaned from the ventilator were compared with the patients who failed to be extubated or died in the hospital. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical course of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and assess the possible predictors of the disease severity leading to VDAHRF. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study. The first 129 patients (18 years or older) with COVID-19 admitted to Monmouth Medical Center from March 1st to April 25th, 2020 were included. RESULTS: Out of 129 patients, 23.25% (n = 30) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and of those, six patients were successfully weaned from the ventilator. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed increased odds of intubation associated with hypoxemia (odds ratio 17.23, 95% CI 5.206-57.088; p < 0.0001), elevated d-dimer by one unit mg/L of FEU (odds ratio 1.515, 95% CI 5.206-57.088; p = 0.0430) and elevated ferritin by one unit ng/ml (odds ratio 1.001, 95% CI 1.000-1.001, p = 0.0051) on admission, adjusted for other covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation were more likely to have older age, male gender, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and obesity. The patients who were successfully weaned from the ventilator were more likely to be younger in age, and none of them had heart failure or CAD.","Mughal, Mohsin Sheraz; Kaur, Ikwinder Preet; Jaffery, Ali R; Dalmacion, Denise L; Wang, Chang; Koyoda, Sai; Kramer, Violet E; Patton, Chandler D; Weiner, Sharon; Eng, Margaret H; Granet, Kenneth M",Respir Med,,427

We aimed to study the potential role of lung ultrasound score (LUS) in subjects with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an observational, prospective pilot study, including consecutive subjects admitted to an intermediate care unit due to COVID-19 pneumonia. LUS is a 12-zone examination method for lung parenchyma assessment. LUS was performed with a portable convex transducer, scores from 0 to 36 points. Clinical and demographic data were collected at LUS evaluation. Survival analysis was performed using a composite outcome including ICU admission or death. Subjects were followed for 30 d from LUS assessment. RESULTS: Of 36 subjects included, 69.4% were male, and mean age was 60.19 ± 12.75 y. A cutoff LUS &#8805; 24 points showed 100% sensitivity, 69.2% specificity, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 for predicting worse prognosis. The composite outcome was present in 10 subjects (55.6%) with LUS &#8805; 24 points, but not in the group with lower LUS scores (P < .001). Subjects with LUS &#8805; 24 points had a higher risk of ICU admission or death (hazard ratio 9.97 [95% CI 2.75-36.14], P < .001). Significant correlations were observed between LUS and SpO2 /FIO2 , serum D-dimer, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. CONCLUSIONS: LUS &#8805; 24 points can help identify patients with COVID-19 who are likely to require ICU admission or to die during follow-up. LUS also correlates significantly with clinical and laboratory markers of COVID-19 severity.","Trias-Sabrià, Pere; Molina-Molina, Maria; Aso, Samantha; Argudo, Marta Hernández; Diez-Ferrer, Marta; Sabater, Joan; Dorca, Jordi; Santos, Salud; Suarez-Cuartin, Guillermo",Respir. care,,427

The eight-item adult version of the ELCSA was translated from English to Sinhala and Tamil. Cognitive testing (on 10 pregnant women and five local experts) and psychometric validation of the self-administered HFI tool were conducted among pregnant women (n = 269) attending the special clinics of the Rajarata Pregnancy Cohort (RaPCo) in Anuradhapura in February 2020. We assessed the psychometric properties and fit using a one parameter logistic model (Rasch model analysis) using STATA Version 14 and WINSTEP software Version 4.3.4. Concurrent validity was tested using psychological distress. The scale was internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.79) and had a good model fit (Rasch items infit statistic range: 0.85 to 1.07). Item 8 ('did not eat for the whole day') was removed from the model fit analysis, as it was not affirmed by respondent. Item severity scores ranged from -2.15 for 'not eating a diverse diet' to 4.43 for 'not eating during the whole day'. Concurrent validity between HFI and psychological distress was confirmed (r = 0.15, p < 0.05). The self-applied version of ELCSA-pregnancy in Sri Lanka (ELCSA-P-SL) is a valid and feasible valid tool. We recommend it to track HFI among pregnant women in lower income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Agampodi, Thilini C; Hromi-Fiedler, Amber; Agampodi, Suneth B; Amarasinghe, Gayani S; Wickramasinghe, Nuwan D; Jayasinghe, Imasha U; Hettiarachchi, Ayesh U; Perez-Escamilla, Rafael",Matern Child Nutr,,427

The dynamics of the droplets is governed by the Maxey-Riley equation with the Basset-Boussinesq history term neglected. We find that, in the absence of gravity, there are two distinct behaviors for the droplets: small droplets cannot go further than a specific distance, which we determine analytically, from the source before getting pulled into the sink. Larger droplets can travel further from the source before getting pulled into the sink by virtue of their larger inertia, and their maximum traveled distance is determined analytically. We investigate the effects of gravity, and we find that there are three distinct droplet behaviors categorized by their relative sizes: small, intermediate-sized, and large. Counterintuitively, we find that the droplets with a minimum horizontal range are neither small nor large, but of intermediate size. Furthermore, we show that in conditions of regular human respiration, these intermediate-sized droplets range in size from a few µm to a few hundred µm. The result that such droplets have a very short range could have important implications for the interpretation of existing data on droplet dispersion.","Cummins, C P; Ajayi, O J; Mehendale, F V; Gabl, R; Viola, I M",Phys Fluids (1994),,427

In this manuscript we analyse the reduction of our congenital heart surgery over these 2 months of state of alarm, and we propose strategies to return to normal. Methods: From our Society congenital heart disease working group, a survey was carried out in Spanish congenital heart disease surgery hospitals, in order to find out the decrease in activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during the time period from March-13 to May-13, 2020. Results: During the pandemic, congenital heart disease surgery was partially reduced, stepping with the most urgent cases and minimizing the scheduled activity. Compared to the same period in 2019, 51% less major surgery and 54% less extracorporeal surgery were performed. Collaboration in adults COVID-19 front line care has been 15%, having 7% of our specialists on quarantine.

We report findings from a scoping review about immigration status as a social determinant of health and discuss ways that immigration status can impede access to health care across levels of the social ecology . We then explore how recent changes to federal immigration policies and current COVID-19 federal relief efforts may serve to create additional barriers to health care for immigrants and their families. Improving health care access for immigrant populations in the U.S. will require interventions at all levels of the social ecology and across vari ous social determinants of health, both in response to COVID-19 and to strengthen health systems more broadly.","Hill, Jessica; Rodriguez, Darlene Xiomara; McDaniel, Paul N",J Migr Health,,427

Yet, establishing the causal effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is difficult because they do not occur arbitrarily. We exploit a quasi-random source of variation for identification purposes -namely, regional differences in the placement on the pandemic curve following an unexpected and nationwide lockdown. Our results reveal that regions where the outbreak had just started when the lockdown was implemented had 1.62 fewer daily deaths per 100,000 inhabitants when compared to regions for which the lockdown arrived 10+ days after the pandemic's outbreak. As a result, a total of 4,642 total deaths (232 deaths/daily) could have been avoided by the end of our period of study -a figure representing 23% of registered deaths in Spain at the time. We rule out differential pre-COVID mortality trends and self-distancing behaviors across the compared regions prior to the swift lockdown, which was also uniformly observed nationwide. In addition, we provide supporting evidence for contagion deceleration as the main mechanism behind the effectiveness of the early adoption of NPIs in lowering the death rate, rather than an increased healthcare capacity.","Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina; Borra, Cristina; Rivera-Garrido, Noelia; Sevilla, Almudena",Econ Hum Biol,,427

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a compelling detection method with high specificity and sensitivity. In this work, a microwave-assisted synthesis method was used for fast and uniform in situ growth of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) onto nanocellulose (NC) membranes, through a seed-mediated process. The as-prepared membranes were fully optimized and its application as SERS platforms was demonstrated. A direct comparison with other cellulose-based substrates showed the superior characteristics of NC such as high mechanical strength, high surface area and lower porous content. An Enhancement Factor (EF) up to ~106 was obtained using rhodamine 6G (R6G) 10−6 M as probe molecule and a remarkable shelf life of at least 7 months was achieved, with no special storage requirements. Preliminary results on the label-free detection of spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 virus are shown, through direct measurements on the optimized SERS membrane.

The study found that 33,292 individuals used IVT anti-VEGF drugs in 2020 before lockdown (20,146 women [60.5%];mean [SD] age, 77.3 [11.1] years), 87,316 during lockdown (52,461 women [60.1%];mean [SD] age, 76.8 [11.0] years), and 63,020 during reopening (38,593 women [61.2%];mean [SD] age, 77.5 [11.0] years). Compared with expected numbers, observed numbers of individuals using IVT anti-VEGF markedly decreased by up to 47.1% (a decrease of 7432 patients) during the 5 first weeks of lockdown (weeks 12-16, 2020) and remained at a low level until the last week of lockdown (-24.9% [4424 fewer patients] during week 19). During the 8 weeks of lockdown, the shortfall represented a decrease of 46,381 injections. A gradual but incomplete recovery was observed in the first 4 weeks of reopening (difference of -21.9% [4247 fewer patients] in week 20 to -4.2% [723 fewer patients] and -3.5% [581 fewer patients] in weeks 22 and 23). Baseline sex and age characteristics of the patient cohort remained similar for each period. The decrease was particularly marked (-65.3%) for treatment initiations during lockdown. This decrease corresponds to a total of 8169 fewer treatment initiations during the lockdown period. A gradual recovery was observed during reopening.","Gage, S.

Chronic exposure to such drugs might lower the risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19).AimTo assess COVID-19 incidence and risk of hospitalisation in a cohort of patients chronically taking chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine.MethodsWe used linked health administration databases to follow a cohort of patients with chronic prescription of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine and a control cohort matched by age, sex and primary care service area, between 1 January and 30 April 2020. COVID-19 cases were identified using International Classification of Diseases 10 codes.ResultsWe analysed a cohort of 6,746 patients (80% female) with active prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, and 13,492 controls. During follow-up, there were 97 (1.4%) COVID-19 cases in the exposed cohort and 183 (1.4%) among controls. The incidence rate was very similar between the two groups (12.05 vs 11.35 cases/100,000 person-days). The exposed cohort was not at lower risk of infection compared with controls (hazard ratio (HR): 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83-1.44; p = 0.50). Forty cases (0.6%) were admitted to hospital in the exposed cohort and 50 (0.4%) in the control cohort, suggesting a higher hospitalisation rate in the former, though differences were not confirmed after adjustment (HR: 1·46; 95% CI: 0.91-2.34; p = 0.10).ConclusionsPatients chronically exposed to chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine did not differ in risk of COVID-19 nor hospitalisation, compared with controls. As controls were mainly female, findings might not be generalisable to a male population.","Vivanco-Hidalgo, Rosa Maria; Molina, Israel; Martinez, Elisenda; Roman-Viñas, Ramón; Sánchez-Montalvá, Adrián; Fibla, Joan; Pontes, Caridad; Velasco Muñoz, César",Euro surveill,,427

A new quantifying reagent for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigen was developed for early and accurate detection. We evaluated the novel quantitative reagent for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigen using an automated laboratory device. METHODS: One-hundred nasopharyngeal samples were collected from 47 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, and 200 samples were collected from healthy donners. We measured the SARS-CoV-2 antigen and nucleic acid using Lumipulse Presto SARS-CoV-2 Ag and the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit, respectively. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen test were 75.7% (56/74) and 96.0% (192/200), respectively. The concordance rate in the positive group between the antigen and nucleic acid tests was 66% (66/100). In addition, the correlation coefficient between the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 antigen and the level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 0.74. There were 19 discrepant samples in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected without SARS-CoV-2 antigen. There was significant difference between the discrepant and matched samples in terms of the time since symptom onset: the 19 discrepant samples were collected a median of 33 days after onset, while the 55 matched samples were collected a median of 19 days after onset. In addition, the 19 discrepant samples were collected from patients who were immune against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: This novel SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection assay is highly sensitive, rapid, accurate, easily diagnostic. It may be useful in both clinical diagnosis and in screening because it does not require special methods such as PCR.","Kobayashi, Ryo; Murai, Ryosei; Asanuma, Koichi; Fujiya, Yoshihiro; Takahashi, Satoshi",J. infect. chemother,,427

Using the SOL program more than 42000 3D molecular structures were docked into the active site of the main protease, and more than 1000 ligands with most negative values of the SOL score were selected for further processing. For all these top ligands, the protein-ligand binding enthalpy has been calculated using the PM7 semiempirical quantum-chemical method with the COSMO implicit solvent model. 20 ligands with the most negative SOL scores and the most negative binding enthalpies have been selected for further experimental testing. The latter has been made by measurements of the inhibitory activity against the main protease and suppression of SARS-CoV-2 replication in a cell culture. The inhibitory activity \of the compounds was determined using a synthetic fluorescently labeled peptide substrate including the proteolysis site of the main protease. The antiviral activity was tested against SARS-CoV-2 virus in the Vero cell culture. Eight compounds showed inhibitory activity against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 in the submicromolar and micromolar ranges of the IC50 values. Three compounds suppressed coronavirus replication in the cell culture at the micromolar range of EC50 values and had low cytotoxicity.

Specialist services, including clinical genetics, must consider methods of remote delivery including videoconferencing-termed telegenetics. This review evaluates the evidence for telegenetics and its applicability to future service development. METHODS: A systematic review of six databases was conducted to identify studies from 2005 onward using synchronous videoconferencing to deliver clinical genetics services. Included studies compared telegenetics to an alternative method or used a before and after design. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria (eight compared telegenetics to in-person consultations and three to telephone delivery). Patient satisfaction, genetic knowledge, and psychosocial outcomes were similar for in-person and telegenetic counseling. There was some evidence that telegenetics may be superior to telephone delivery for knowledge gain and reduction in anxiety and depression. There is limited evidence concerning the effect of telegenetics on provider satisfaction and behavioral outcomes. Conclusions are limited by at least moderate risk of bias in all evaluated studies and small sample sizes. CONCLUSION: Across most outcomes measured, telegenetics had equivalent outcomes to in-person appointment; however, the extent to which the available evidence is applicable to longer-term use is debatable.","Brown, Elizabeth G; Watts, Isabella; Beales, Emily R; Maudhoo, Ashwini; Hayward, Judith; Sheridan, Eamonn; Rafi, Imran",Genet. med,,427

287223,The Corona Crisis: What Can We Learn from Earlier Studies in Applied Psychology?,2020,"Considering the temporary closure of many food-away-from-home establishments, consumer expenditure on groceries during the COVID-19 pandemic has increased. While grocery shopping is an essential activity, not much is known about the dynamic relationship of the COVID-19 pandemic to the behavior of grocery shoppers. With an objective to inform variability in the behavior of grocery shoppers under various scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted an online framed choice experiment to elicit preferences for purchasing methods, time windows, minimum order requirements, and fees. The manipulating factor relates to the trend in the COVID-19 pandemic, where we consider three scenarios: an increasing, decreasing, or constant number of new cases in the past two-week period. Using 32,400 choice decisions from a representative sample of 900 grocery shoppers in the United States, we conclude that the trend in the COVID-19 pandemic causes significant differences in grocery shopping preferences. In situations where COVID-19 is spreading at an increasing rate, consumers are generally less willing to shop inside the grocery store. When COVID-19 is spreading at a decreasing rate, the relative importance of the purchasing method attribute is lower in its entirety. We use our findings to inform recommendations for practitioners and policymakers.","Grashuis, Jasper; Skevas, Theodoros; Segovia, Michelle S.",Sustainability,,427

METHODS: Individuals who visited a primary healthcare service in Sollentuna (Sweden) and agreed to participate in the programme between 1988 and 1993 were followed. They had at least one CV risk factor but no prior myocardial infarction and received support to increase physical activity using the programme Physical Activity on Prescription and to adopt health-promoting behaviours including cooking classes, weight reduction, smoking cessation and stress management. Participants (n=5761) were compared with a randomly selected, propensity score-matched reference group from the general population in Stockholm County (n=34 556). All individuals were followed in Swedish registers until December 2011. RESULTS: In the intervention group and the reference group there were 698 (12.1%) and 4647 (13.4%) first CV events, 308 (5.3%) and 2261 (6.5%) CV deaths, and 919 (16.5%) and 6405 (18.5%) all-cause deaths, respectively, during a mean follow-up of 22 years.

CONCLUSIONS: Participation in a CVD prevention programme in primary healthcare focusing on promotion of physical activity and healthy lifestyle was associated with lower risk of CV events (12%), CV deaths (21%) and all-cause deaths (17%) after two decades. Promoting physical activity and healthy living in the primary healthcare setting may prevent CVD.","Journath, Gunilla; Hammar, Niklas; Vikström, Max; Linnersjö, Anette; Walldius, Göran; Krakau, Ingvar; Lindgren, Peter; de Faire, Ulf; Hellenius, Mai-Lis",Br. j. sports med,,427

To date, many countries, including China, have adopted ECMO as a treatment for severe COVID-19. However, marked differences in patient survival rates have been reported, and the underlying reasons are unclear. This study aimed to summarize the experience of using ECMO to treat severe COVID-19 and provide suggestions for improving ECMO management. The effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and the effects of ECMO on the clinical outcomes in patients with severe cases of COVID-19 were reviewed. Recent data from frontline workers involved in the use of ECMO in Wuhan, China, and those experienced in the implementation of artificial heart and lung support strategies were analysed. There is evidence that ECMO may complicate the pathophysiological state in COVID-19 patients. However, many studies have shown that the appropriate application of ECMO improves the prognosis of such patients. To expand our understanding of the benefits of ECMO for critically ill patients with COVID-19, further prospective, multicentre clinical trials are needed.","Huang, Shiqian; Zhao, Shuai; Luo, Huilin; Wu, Zhouyang; Wu, Jing; Xia, Haifa; Chen, Xiangdong",BMC Pulm Med,,427

But no studies to date have systematically described liver test abnormalities in patients with COVID-19. We evaluated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with abnormal liver test results. METHODS: Clinical records and laboratory results were obtained from 417 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China from January 11 to February 21, 2020 and followed up to March 7, 2020. Information on clinical features of patients with abnormal liver tests were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Of 417 patients with COVID-19, 318 (76.3%) had abnormal liver test results and 90 (21.5%) had liver injury during hospitalization. The presence of abnormal liver tests became more pronounced during hospitalization within 2 weeks, with 49 (23.4%), 31 (14.8%), 24 (11.5%) and 51 (24.4%) patients having alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels elevated to more than 3× the upper limit of normal, respectively. Patients with abnormal liver tests of hepatocellular type or mixed type at admission had higher odds of progressing to severe disease (odds ratios [ORs] 2.73; 95% CI 1.19-6.3, and 4.44, 95% CI 1.93-10.23, respectively). The use of lopinavir/ritonavir was also found to lead to increased odds of liver injury (OR from 4.44 to 5.03, both p <0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with abnormal liver tests were at higher risk of progressing to severe disease. The detrimental effects on liver injury mainly related to certain medications used during hospitalization, which should be monitored and evaluated frequently. LAY SUMMARY: Data on liver tests in patients with COVID-19 are scarce. We observed a high prevalence of liver test abnormalities and liver injury in 417 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our referral center, and the prevalence increased substantially during hospitalization. The presence of abnormal liver tests and liver injury were associated with the progression to severe pneumonia. The detrimental effects on liver injury were related to certain medications used during hospitalization, which warrants frequent monitoring and evaluation for these patients.","Cai, Qingxian; Huang, Deliang; Yu, Hong; Zhu, Zhibin; Xia, Zhang; Su, Yinan; Li, Zhiwei; Zhou, Guangde; Gou, Jizhou; Qu, Jiuxin; Sun, Yan; Liu, Yingxia; He, Qing; Chen, Jun; Liu, Lei; Xu, Lin",J Hepatol,,427

Medical data of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in two university-based hospitals during an outbreak in Daegu, South Korea, were retrospectively analyzed. AKI and its severity were defined according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network. Of the 164 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 30 patients (18.3%) had AKI; 14, 4, and 12 patients had stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

There were 17 deaths (56.7%) among AKI patients; 4 (28.6%), 1 (25.0%), and 12 (100.0%), respectively. In-hospital mortality was higher in AKI patients than in non-AKI patients (56.7% vs. 20.8%, p < 0.001). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, stage 3 AKI was associated with higher mortality than either non-AKI or stage 1 AKI (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.62 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.75-7.48), p = 0.001; HR = 15.65 (95% CI = 2.43-100.64), p = 0.004). Among the AKI patients, acute respiratory distress syndrome and low serum albumin on admission were considered independent risk factors for stage 3 AKI (both p < 0.05).

New information technologies play significant roles in such critical situations to address and relieve stress during the coronavirus crisis. This article endeavours to recognize the challenges policymakers have typically experienced during pandemic diseases, including Covid-19, and, accordingly, new information technology capabilities to encounter with them. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The current study utilizes the synthesis of findings of experts' opinions within the systematic review process as the research method to recognize the best available evidence drawn from text and opinion to offer practical guidance for policymakers. RESULTS: The results illustrate that the challenges fall into two categories including; encountering the disease and reducing the results of the disease. Furthermore, Internet of things, cloud computing, machine learning and social networking play the most significant roles to address these challenges.","Mehraeen, Mohammad; Dadkhah, Mehdi; Mehraeen, AmirReza",Eur J Clin Invest,,427
290059,Patients or passports? The 'hostile environment' in the NHS,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated social distancing and lockdown restrictions are expected to have substantial and enduring mental health effects. In this study, we aimed to assess depression levels before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. METHODS: We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) brief screening instrument to detect probable depression in two nationally representative surveys of US adults. Pre-pandemic levels of depression were assessed in a sample of 5,075 adults from the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Depression was assessed in March (N = 6,819) and April 2020 (N = 5,428) in the Understanding America Study, a representative sample of the US population. RESULTS: The percentage of US adults with depression increased significantly from 8.7% (95% CI[7.6%-9.8%]) in 2017-2018 to 10.6% (95% CI[9.6%-11.6%) in March 2020 and 14.4% (95% CI[13.1%-15.7%]) in April 2020. Statistically significant increases in depression levels were observed for all population subgroups examined with the exception of those aged 65+ years and Black participants. Young adults (aged 18-34) experienced a marked increase in depression of 13.4 percentage points (95% CI [9.5%-17.2%]) that was larger than any other age group. Additional analyses of depression trends in NHANES from 2007/2008-2017/2018 showed that the substantial increase in depression in April 2020 was unlikely to be due to typical year-to-year variation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that depression levels have risen substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic and reinforce recent findings indicating that young adults may be particularly vulnerable to the mental health effects of the pandemic.","Daly, Michael; Sutin, Angelina R; Robinson, Eric",J Affect Disord,,427

Risk factors associated with the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia in intensive care unit (ICU) have not yet been well determined. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-centered, observational study, in which 47 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were consecutively enrolled from February 24 to April 5, 2020. The patients were registered from the ICU of Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were collected and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to analyze the risk factors of death in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: The study cohort included 47 adult patients with an average age of 70.55±12.52 years, and 30 (63.8%) patients were men. Totally 15 (31.9%) patients died. When compared to survivors, nonsurvivors showed a higher proportion of septic shock [6 (40%) patients vs. 3 (9.4%) patients], disseminated intravascular coagulation [3 (21.4%) vs. 0], and had higher score of APACHE II (25.07±8.03 vs. 15.56±5.95), CURB-65 {3 [2-4] vs. 2 [1-3]}, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) {7 [5-9] vs. 3 [1-6]}, higher level of D-dimer {5.74 [2.32-18] vs 2.05 [1.09-4.00]} and neutrophil count {9.4 [7.68-14.54] vs. 5.32 [3.85-9.34]}.

Patients with higher lymphocyte count (>0.63×109 /L) and lower SOFA score (&#8804;4) on admission had a significantly better prognosis than those with lower lymphocyte count (&#8804;0.63×109 /L) and higher SOFA score (>4) in overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Higher SOFA score and lower lymphocyte count at admission were connected with poor prognosis of patients with COVID-19 in ICU. Lymphocyte count may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker.","Sai, Fangfang; Liu, Xiaolei; Li, Lanyu; Ye, Yan; Zhu, Changqing; Hang, Ying; Huang, Conghua; Tian, Lei; Huang, Huan; Xu, Xinhui",Ann. palliat. med.

292626,Functional data analysis: An application to COVID-19 data in the United States,2020-09-17,"The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is related to abundant replication in the upper airways, which is not observed for the other highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We here reveal features of the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which optimize the virus towards the human respiratory tract. First, the S proteins exhibit an intrinsic temperature preference, corresponding with the temperature of the upper or lower airways. Pseudoviruses bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike (SARS-2-S) were more infectious when produced at 33°C instead of 37°C, a property shared with the S protein of HCoV-229E, a common cold coronavirus. In contrast, the S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV favored 37°C, in accordance with virus preference for the lower airways. Next, SARS-2-S-driven entry was efficiently activated by not only TMPRSS2, but also the TMPRSS13 protease, thus broadening the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2. Both proteases proved relevant in the context of authentic virus replication. TMPRSS13 appeared an effective spike activator for the virulent coronaviruses but not the low pathogenic HCoV-229E virus. Activation of SARS-2-S by these surface proteases requires processing of the S1/S2 cleavage loop, in which both the furin recognition motif and extended loop length proved critical. Conversely, entry of loop deletion mutants is significantly increased in cathepsin-rich cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the D614G mutation increases SARS-CoV-2 stability, particularly at 37°C, and, enhances its use of the cathepsin L pathway. This indicates a link between S protein stability and usage of this alternative route for virus entry. Since these spike properties may promote virus spread, they potentially explain why the spike-G614 variant has replaced the early D614 variant to become globally predominant. Collectively, our findings reveal adaptive mechanisms whereby the coronavirus spike protein is adjusted to match the temperature and protease conditions of the airways, to enhance virus transmission and pathology.","Laporte, Manon; Raeymaekers, Valerie; Van Berwaer, Ria; Vandeput, Julie; Marchand-Casas, Isabel; Thibaut, Hendrik-Jan; Van Looveren, Dominique; Martens, Katleen; Hoffmann, Markus; Maes, Piet; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Naesens, Lieve; Stevaert, Annelies",PLoS Pathog,,427

A diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (KD) should be considered in infants with exanthematous fever. More perplexing is the increasing incidence of an atypical form of KD. Pathogenesis of KD remains unclear even though an aberrant response of the immune system to an unidentified pathogen is often hypothesised. A 30-fold increase in the incidence of KD in Italy during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic suggests an immune response to a viral trigger. We report an infant clinically diagnosed with high probability as incomplete KD, who presented with reactivation of the BCG injection site even though fever with rash was only less than 3 days duration. Echocardiography confirmed coronary artery abnormalities and prompt treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin facilitated rapid recovery. Physicians should consider a diagnosis of KD if BCG site reactivation is noted in children presenting with febrile exanthema.","Lim, Kimberley Ying Ying; Chua, Mei Chien; Tan, Natalie Woon Hui; Chandran, Suresh",BMJ case reports,,427

Unfortunately, several of these high-profile publications were retracted because of concerns regarding the soundness and quality of the studies and the EHR data they purported to analyze. These retractions highlight that although a small community of EHR informatics experts can readily identify strengths and flaws in EHR-derived studies, many medical editorial teams and otherwise sophisticated medical readers lack the framework to fully critically appraise these studies. In addition, conventional statistical analyses cannot overcome the need for an understanding of the opportunities and limitations of EHR-derived studies. We distill here from the broader informatics literature six key considerations that are crucial for appraising studies utilizing EHR data: data completeness, data collection and handling (eg, transformation), data type (ie, codified, textual), robustness of methods against EHR variability (within and across institutions, countries, and time), transparency of data and analytic code, and the multidisciplinary approach. These considerations will inform researchers, clinicians, and other stakeholders as to the recommended best practices in reviewing manuscripts, grants, and other outputs from EHR-data derived studies, and thereby promote and foster rigor, quality, and reliability of this rapidly growing field.","Kohane, Isaac S; Aronow, Bruce J; Avillach, Paul; Beaulieu-Jones, Brett K; Bellazzi, Riccardo; Bradford, Robert L; Brat, Gabriel A; Cannataro, Mario; Cimino, James J; García-Barrio, Noelia; Gehlenborg, Nils; Ghassemi, Marzyeh; Gutiérrez-Sacristán, Alba; Hanauer, David A; Holmes, John H; Hong, Chuan; Klann, Jeffrey G; Loh, Ne Hooi Will; Luo, Yuan; Mandl, Kenneth D; Daniar, Mohamad; Moore, Jason H; Murphy, Shawn N; Neuraz, Antoine; Ngiam, Kee Yuan; Omenn, Gilbert S; Palmer, Nathan; Patel, Lav P; Pedrera-Jiménez, Miguel; Sliz, Piotr; South, Andrew M; Tan, Amelia Li Min; Taylor, Deanne M; Taylor, Bradley W; Torti, Carlo; Vallejos, Andrew K; Wagholikar, Kavishwar B; Weber, Griffin M; Cai, Tianxi",J Med Internet Res,,427

ELVs downregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and enhance the expression of a set of protective proteins hindering cell surface virus binding and upregulating defensive proteins against lung damage. In addition, ELVs and their precursors decreased the signal of spike (S) protein found in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, suggesting that the lipids curb viral infection.

METHODS: In September 2015, a collaborative practice agreement between pharmacists and transplant providers at an academic medical center for management of PTHG was developed. The goal of the pharmacist-run service was to reduce hospitalizations by providing care to patients in the acute phase of hyperglycemia while they transitioned back to their primary care provider or endocrinologist. For continuous quality improvement, preimplementation data were collected from August 2014 to August 2015 and compared to postimplementation data collected from August 2017 to August 2018. The primary endpoint was hospitalizations due to hyperglycemia within 90 days post transplantation. Secondary endpoints included emergency department (ED) visits due to hypoglycemia and the number of interventions performed, number of encounters completed, and number of ED visits or admissions for hypoglycemia. A Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical data, and a Student t test was used to compare continuous data. A P value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: Forty-three patients in the preimplementation group were compared to 35 patients in the postimplementation group. There was a significant reduction in hospitalizations due to hyperglycemia in the postimplementation versus the preimplementation group (9 vs 1, P < 0.05); there was a reduction in ED visits due to hyperglycemia (5 vs 0, P = 0.06). There were no ED visits or hospitalizations due to hypoglycemia in either group. Clinical transplant pharmacists performed an average of 8.3 (SD, 4.4) encounters per patient per 90 days. CONCLUSION: A collaborative practice agreement was created and successfully implemented. A pharmacist-managed PTHG program could be incorporated into the standard care of kidney transplant recipients to help minimize rehospitalizations due to hyperglycemia.","Do, Vincent; Haakinson, Danielle; Belfort-DeAguiar, Renata; Cohen, Elizabeth",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,427
295982,Comic Moments in the School Library: Reflections on an After-School Book Club,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is considerable evidence of widespread emotional distress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. A growing number of studies have assessed posttraumatic growth related to the current pandemic; but, none have considered whether reported growth is real or illusory (i.e., characterized by avoidant or defensive coping that results in higher levels of distress). The purpose of this study was to extend this literature by assessing growth specific to the pandemic in people reporting high levels of COVID-related stress and estimating the extent of real and illusory COVID-19-related growth. METHODS: Participants were 893 adults from Canada and the United States with high levels of COVID-related stress who provided complete responses on measures of posttraumatic growth, disability, and measures of general and COVID-related distress as part of a larger longitudinal survey. RESULTS: Approximately 77 % of participants reported moderate to high growth in at least one respect, the most common being developing greater appreciation for healthcare workers, for the value of one's own life, for friends and family, for each day, as well as changing priorities about what is important in life and greater feelings of self-reliance. Consistent with predictions, cluster analysis identified two clusters characterized by high growth, one comprising 32 % of the sample and reflective of real growth (i.e., reporting little disability and stable symptoms across time) and the other comprising 17 % of the sample and reflective of illusory growth (i.e., reporting high disability and worsening symptoms). These clusters did not differ in terms of socially desirable response tendencies; but, the illusory growth cluster reported greater increases in alcohol use since onset of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Consistent with research regarding personal growth in response to prior pandemics and COVID-19, we found evidence to suggest moderate to high levels of COVID-related growth with respect to appreciation for healthcare workers, life, friends and family, and self-reliance. Findings from our cluster analysis support the thesis that many reports of COVID-related personal growth reflect ineffectual pandemic-related coping as opposed to true growth. These findings have important implications for developing strategies to optimize stress resilience and posttraumatic growth during chronically stressful events such as pandemics.","Asmundson, Gordon J G; Paluszek, Michelle M; Taylor, Steven",J Anxiety Disord,,427

RECENT FINDINGS: There was a significant decrease in lung transplant volumes during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic due to a combination of reduced availability of donors and an imbalance between waitlist additions and inactivations. SARS-CoV-2 infection was subsequently associated with an exuberant immune response that can lead to the development of postinfectious fibrotic lung disease. Few lung transplants have been performed in previously infected recipients and long-term outcomes remain unknown. Although the lung transplant volume rebounded during the second wave, it is unclear what the long-term effects of healthcare resource limitation and public health measures will have on transplant volumes in the future. Outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection in previous lung transplant recipients appear to be worse than the general public, and, although an immunosuppressed state likely contributes to these outcomes, whether immunosuppression should be altered in those exposed to or infected with SARS-CoV-2 remains unanswered in the absence of unequivocal data. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a number of challenges for lung transplant programs across the globe. Multiple research questions remain to be answered in order to optimally manage lung transplant recipients in the context of this pandemic.","Bery, Amit I; Kulkarni, Hrishikesh S; Kreisel, Daniel",Curr Opin Organ Transplant,,427

OBJECTIVE: We sought to address the dynamic changes in hematologic and immunologic biomarkers and their associations with severity and outcomes of COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective study including 548 patients with COVID-19 with clarified outcome (discharged or deceased) from a national cohort in China was performed. Cross-sectional and longitudinal variations were compared and the associations with different severity and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: On admission, the counts of lymphocytes, T-cell subsets, eosinophils, and platelets decreased markedly, especially in severe/critical and fatal patients. Increased neutrophil count and neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio were predominant in severe/critical cases or nonsurvivors. During hospitalization, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and platelets showed an increasing trend in survivors, but maintained lower levels or dropped significantly afterwards in nonsurvivors. Nonsurvivors kept a high level or showed an upward trend for neutrophils, IL-6, procalcitonin, D-dimer, amyloid A protein, and C-reactive protein, which were kept stable or showed a downward trend in survivors. Positive correlation between CD8+ T-cell and lymphocytes count was found in survivors but not in nonsurvivors. A multivariate Cox regression model suggested that restored levels of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and platelets could serve as predictors for recovery, whereas progressive increases in neutrophils, basophils, and IL-6 were associated with fatal outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Hematologic and immunologic impairment showed a significantly different profile between survivors and nonsurvivors in patients with COVID-19 with different severity. The longitudinal variations in these biomarkers could serve to predict recovery or fatal outcome.","Chen, Ruchong; Sang, Ling; Jiang, Mei; Yang, Zhaowei; Jia, Nan; Fu, Wanyi; Xie, Jiaxing; Guan, Weijie; Liang, Wenhua; Ni, Zhengyi; Hu, Yu; Liu, Lei; Shan, Hong; Lei, Chunliang; Peng, Yixiang; Wei, Li; Liu, Yong; Hu, Yahua; Peng, Peng; Wang, Jianming; Liu, Jiyang; Chen, Zhong; Li, Gang; Zheng, Zhijian; Qiu, Shaoqin; Luo, Jie; Ye, Changjiang; Zhu, Shaoyong; Zheng, Jinping; Zhang, Nuofu; Li, Yimin; He, Jianxing; Li, Jing; Li, Shiyue; Zhong, Nanshan",J Allergy Clin Immunol,,427

In order to increase the capacity of laboratory-based molecular SARS-CoV-2 testing, it has been suggested to combine several samples and jointly measure them in a sample pool. While saving cost and labour at first sight, pooling efficiency depends on the pool size and the presently experienced prevalence of positive samples. Here we address the question of the optimum pool size at a given prevalence. We demonstrate the relation between analytical effort and pool size and delineate the effects of the target prevalence on the optimum pool size. Finally, we derive a simple-to-use formula and table that allow laboratories performing sample pooling to assess the optimum pool size at the currently experienced target prevalence rate.","Regen, Francesca; Eren, Neriman; Heuser, Isabella; Hellmann-Regen, Julian",Int J Infect Dis,,427

We aimed to describe the psychological impact and experiences of family members of silent mentors during the COVID-19 pandemic using qualitative interviews. Many expressed feelings of remorse and unrest about the unprecedented delay of the SMP. The delay increased negative emotions particularly among some elderly family members; however, there was no prominent negative effect on their functional health and well-being. Several participants relayed the belief that the soul cannot rest until the body receives a proper burial while some worried about the deterioration of the physical condition of the mentors. In conclusion, findings provide insights into the importance of not overlooking the mental health implications of delaying the SMP in future outbreaks or crises.","Wong, Li Ping; Tan, Sik Loo; Alias, Haridah; Sia, Thiam Eng; Saw, Aik",Omega (Westport),,427

The research goal is to give a clearer idea of the broad directions and paradigm shifts in Twitter usage discourse over the years. Its major goal is to examine thematic trends, theoretical framework and methodology that have characterized the discourse. Sixty relevant articles were identified, coded and content-analyzed. Findings revealed that dominant themes include stakeholder perceptions of communication strategies, social network sites, dynamics of global pandemic (i.e Covid-19 pandemic) and corporate reputation. Also, experiment, case study and survey are the dominant research methods that characterize research in this discourse. Findings also revealed large domination of the Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT) and the Image Repair Theory. However, research in this area lacks significant empirical evidence from Africa and Nigeria in particular, where the global pandemic seems to be a recurring phenomenon. The majority of the reviewed journal articles were conducted in the Western clime, with little attention on Africa. Scholarship needs to move beyond this point to provide a holistic and balanced view on the crisis by exploring cases in Africa and particularly, in Nigeria. This gap will provide an opportunity for understanding the global pandemic (i.e. Covid-19) dynamics in Africa and will further determine whether findings can be consistent across the world.","Adelua, M.; Oyedepo, T.; Odiboh, O.",Heliyon,,427

Ex vivo samples often display secondary dyskinesia from cell damage during sampling, infection or inflammation confounding PCD diagnostic results. ALI culture enables regeneration of healthy cilia facilitating differentiation of primary from secondary ciliary dyskinesia. We describe a revised ALI culture method adopted from April 2018 across three collaborating PCD diagnostic sites, including current University Hospital Southampton COVID-19 risk mitigation measures, and present results. Two hundred and forty nasal epithelial cell samples were seeded for ALI culture and 199 (82.9%) were ciliated. Fifty-four of 83 (63.9%) ex vivo samples which were originally equivocal or insufficient provided diagnostic information following in vitro culture. Surplus basal epithelial cells from 181 nasal brushing samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen; 39 samples were ALI-cultured after cryostorage and all ciliated. The ciliary beat patterns of ex vivo samples (by high-speed video microscopy) were recapitulated, scanning electron microscopy demonstrated excellent ciliation, and cilia could be immuno-fluorescently labelled (anti-alpha-tubulin and anti-RSPH4a) in representative cases that were ALI-cultured after cryostorage. In summary, our ALI culture protocol provides high ciliation rates across three centres, minimising patient recall for repeat brushing biopsies and improving diagnostic certainty. Cryostorage of surplus diagnostic samples was successful, facilitating PCD research.","Coles, Janice L; Thompson, James; Horton, Katie L; Hirst, Robert A; Griffin, Paul; Williams, Gwyneth M; Goggin, Patricia; Doherty, Regan; Lackie, Peter M; Harris, Amanda; Walker, Woolf T; O039,; Callaghan, Christopher; Hogg, Claire; Lucas, Jane S; Blume, Cornelia; Jackson, Claire L",,,427

302254,Changes in angler demography and angling patterns during the Covid-19 lockdown in spring 2020 measured through a citizen science platform,2021,"In this article, we share our experiences in designing and developing a suite of deep neural network-(DNN) based COVID-19 case detection and recognition framework. Existing pathological tests such as RT-PCR-based pathogen RNA detection from nasal swabbing seem to display low detection rates during the early stages of virus contraction. Moreover, the reliance on a few overburdened laboratories based around an epicenter capable of supplying large numbers of RT-PCR tests makes this testing method non-scalable when the rate of infections is high. Similarly, finding an effective drug or vaccine with which to combat COVID-19 requires a long time and many clinical trials. The development of pathological COVID-19 tests is hindered by shortages in the supply chain of chemical reagents necessary for testing on a large scale. This diminishes the speed of diagnosis and the ability to filter out COVID-19 positive patients from uninfected patients on a national level. Existing research has shown that DNN has been successful in identifying COVID-19 from radiological media such as CT scans and X-ray images, audio media such as cough sounds, optical coherence tomography to identify conjunctivitis and pink eye symptoms on the ocular surface, body temperature measurement using smartphone fingerprint sensors or thermal cameras, the use of live facial detection to identify safe social distancing practices from camera images, and face mask detection from camera images. We also investigate the utility of federated learning in diagnosis cases where private data can be trained via edge learning. These point-of-care modalities can be integrated with DNN-based RT-PCR laboratory test results to assimilate multiple modalities of COVID-19 detection and thereby provide more dimensions of diagnosis. Finally, we will present our initial test results, which are encouraging. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","Rahman, M. D. A.; Hossain, M. S.; Alrajeh, N. A.; Gupta, B.

Relief measures instituted by World Bank Group (WBG) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help in the prevention, detection and treatment of coronavirus amidst SSA non-monetary measures and business support interventions are highlighted. The underlying economic challenges likely to impede WBG and IMF relief measures in SSA such as health infrastructure and resource deficiency, unsustainable high debt levels and drought effects due to climate change are analysed. Ranking the inadequate doctor-to-population ratio from 2015 to 2017, SSA ratio stood at less than 1 per 1000 population recommended World Health Organisation standard. On the credit front, other creditors such as China have contributed to prevailing economic challenges as China Official Development Assistance (ODA) to SSA debt ratio is depicted at 55% in 2016 from a low ratio of 17% in 2009. The economic challenges are further buttressed by estimated monthly tourism sector loss of US$8.8 billion per month for SSA countries during the pandemic. SSA self-employed informal sector that accounts for 76% (International Labour Organisation 2018) is equally affected amid lockdowns, business losses, closures and job losses. Economic growth is forecasted to drop to 1.8%, from a previous estimate of 3.2% according to United Nations Economic Commission (2020) due to a trade fall with developed and emerging markets. Recovery is aligned to good resilience in inherent cyber risk, oil intensity and urbanisation rate and policies to enhance production and the agriculture sector.","Ndiili, Nchimunya",Environ Syst Decis,,427

Novel methods of N95 filtering face-piece respirator decontamination that can be scaled-up for in-hospital use can help address this concern and keep healthcare workers (HCWs) safe. METHODS: A multidisciplinary pragmatic study was conducted to evaluate the use of an ultrasonic room high-level disinfection system (HLDS) that generates aerosolized peracetic acid (PAA) and hydrogen peroxide for decontamination of large numbers of N95 respirators. A cycle duration that consistently achieved disinfection of N95 respirators (defined as &#8805;6 log10 reductions in bacteriophage MS2 and Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores inoculated onto respirators) was identified. The treated masks were assessed for changes to their hydrophobicity, material structure, strap elasticity, and filtration efficiency. PAA and hydrogen peroxide off-gassing from treated masks were also assessed. RESULTS: The PAA room HLDS was effective for disinfection of bacteriophage MS2 and G. stearothermophilus spores on respirators in a 2,447 cubic-foot (69.6 cubic-meter) room with an aerosol deployment time of 16 minutes and a dwell time of 32 minutes. The total cycle time was 1 hour and 16 minutes. After 5 treatment cycles, no adverse effects were detected on filtration efficiency, structural integrity, or strap elasticity. There was no detectable off-gassing of PAA and hydrogen peroxide from the treated masks at 20 and 60 minutes after the disinfection cycle, respectively. CONCLUSION: The PAA room disinfection system provides a rapidly scalable solution for in-hospital decontamination of large numbers of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic.","John, Amrita R; Raju, Shine; Cadnum, Jennifer L; Lee, Kipum; McClellan, Phillip; Akkus, Ozan; Miller, Sharon K; Jennings, Wayne D; Buehler, Joy A; Li, Daniel F; Redmond, Sarah N; Braskie, Melissa; Hoyen, Claudia K; Donskey, Curtis J",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,427

Our research examines the impact of COVID-19 on members of share houses in the state of Victoria, Australia. This cohort is more likely to be young, casually employed, living in informal arrangements and at risk of homelessness than the broader population. We propose a conceptual framework for investigating the factors driving vulnerability to shocks and the resources most likely to support individuals to respond to or recover from these shocks. We surveyed 1052 share house occupants in June 2020. We found dramatic results, with 74% losing their job or having their hours reduced, 47% experiencing a reduction in their financial situation and 50% reporting that their mental health had deteriorated. These outcomes were worse for young people, casual employees or immigrants. Our research highlights the positive influence of social support for low-income individuals. We find that government social welfare payments are the most impactful form of insurance, calling for a greater appreciation of the role of social welfare in supporting resilience following a disaster.","Raynor, Katrina Panza Laura",Cities,,427

The results show that the apparent LPPLS bubble patterns of the super-exponential increase, corrected by the accelerating logarithm-periodic oscillations, have indeed presented in the price trajectories of the seven indexes: S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ, DAX, CSI 300, BSESN, and BOVESPA, indicating that the large positive bubbles have formed endogenously prior to the 2020 stock market crash, and the subsequent crashes for the seven indexes are endogenous, stemming from the increasingly systemic instability of the stock markets, while the well-known external shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic etc. only acted as sparks during the 2020 global stock market crash. In contrast, the obvious signatures of the LPPLS model have not been observed in the price trajectories of the three remaining indexes: FTSE, NIKKEI, and HSI, signifying that the crashes in these three indexes are exogenous, stemming from external shocks. The novel classification method of crash types proposed in this study can also be used to analyze regime changes of any price trajectories in global financial markets.","Song, Ruiqiang; Shu, Min; Zhu, Wei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00327v1.pdf,427

Emerging in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it spread widely across the world causing panic-worst ever economic depression is visibly predictable. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged as a major public health concern having caused three zoonotic outbreaks; severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2002-2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and currently this devastating COVID-19. Research strategies focused on understanding the evolutionary origin, transmission, and molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 and its pathogenesis need to be urgently formulated to manage the current and possible future coronaviral outbreaks. Current response to the COVID-19 outbreak has been largely limited to monitoring/containment. Although frantic global efforts for developing safe and effective prophylactic and therapeutic agents are on, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists till date. In this review, research strategies for coping with COVID-19 based on evolutionary and molecular aspects of coronaviruses have been proposed.","Majid, Sabhiya; Farooq, Rabia; Khan, Mosin S; Rashid, Samia; Bhat, Showkat A; Wani, Hilal A; Qureshi, Waseem",SN Compr Clin Med,,427
309567,Taking the Pandemic by Its Horns: Using Work-Related Task Conflict to Transform Perceived Pandemic Threats Into Creativity,2020,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in many cases of morbidity and mortality across the globe, and the lack of the COVID-19 vaccine has contributed greatly to this experience. COVID-19 vaccines have currently been rolled out, and are available in some countries. However, strategies need to be put in place to prevent COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (VH) especially in Africa; a continent where VH has been previously reported following the introduction of new vaccines. For this cause, we, therefore, recommend optimal community involvement in the structure and modalities for the delivery of the prospective COVID-19 vaccine. Also, feedback mechanisms for the acknowledgement of community efforts in previous health interventions should be improved upon to encourage the acceptance of the prospective COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, improved multi-sectoral collaboration should be initiated and promoted to enhance the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines through the provision of more resources required to address COVID-19 VH. Furthermore, integration of the COVID-19 vaccine into the routine immunization schedule would strengthen the health system, improve uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine, and improve the health of all persons living on the African continent.","Afolabi, Aanuoluwapo Adeyimika; Ilesanmi, Olayinka Stephen",Pan Afr Med J,,427
309604,Do Lockdown Policies Reduce Economic and Social Activities? Evidence from NO2 Emissions,2021,"Additives are added to polymers in small concentration to achieve desired application properties widely used to tailor the properties. The rapid diversification of their molecular structures, with often only minute differences, necessitates the development of adequate chromatographic techniques. While modified silica so far is the workhorse as stationary phase we have probed the potential of porous graphitic carbon (HypercarbTM) for this purpose. The results show that the multitude of physicochemical interactions between analyte molecules and the graphitic surface enables separations of polyolefin stabilizers with unprecedented selectivity. To support the chromatographic results the adsorption capability of HypercarbTM for selected antioxidants and UV absorbers has been determined by Raman spectroscopy and argon physisorption measurements. The shift of the Graphite-band in the Raman spectra of HypercarbTM upon infusion with additives correlates with the changes in the Adsorption Potential Distributions. The results of argon physisorption measurements go hand in hand with the chronology of desorption of the additives in liquid chromatography experiments. The elution sequence can be explained by van der Waals or London forces, &#960;-&#960;-interactions and electron lone pair donor-acceptor interactions between the graphite surface and analyte functional groups.","Kot, David; Zou, Mingyi; Brunnengräber, Kai; Arndt, Jan-Hendrik; Macko, Tibor; Etzold, Bastian J M; Brüll, Robert",J Chromatogr A,,427

After tumor resection, 52 cases of intercalary and 28 cases of osteoarticular bone grafts were used. The implanted bone included devitalized recycling bone, fibular, and allograft.The average follow up period was 42.19 months for 80 patients, among whom 15 (18.75%) died. The 5-year EFS and OS were 58% and 69%, respectively. The average length of the replanted bone was 18.57âcm. The MSTS scores of intercalary and osteoarticular bone grafts were 87.24% and 64.00%, respectively. In 23 cases (44.23%) of metaphyseal and 26 cases (32.5%) of the diaphysis, bone graft union was obtained at the first stage. The factors affecting bone union were the patient's gender, age, devitalization bone methods and whether the implanted bone was completely fixed. Postoperative complications included delayed bone union in 15 patients, fractures in 25 cases, nonunion in 22 cases, bone resorption in 14 cases, and postoperative infection in 4 cases. Twenty-eight cases of bone grafting required revision surgery, including replacement of internal fixation, autologous bone graft, debridement, removal of internal fixation, and replacement with prosthetic replacement.Biological reconstructions with massive bone grafts are useful in the reconstruction of certain malignant extremity bone tumors after wide excision.","Yao, Weitao; Cai, Qiqing; Wang, Jiaqiang; Zhang, Peng; Wang, Xin; Du, Xinhui; Niu, Xiaohui",Medicine (Baltimore),,427

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: MEDLINE, Cochrane, Web of Sciences, and SCOPUS were searched for retrospective or prospective observational studies reporting data on cardiovascular risk factors and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Univariable and multivariable age-adjusted analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between cardiovascular risk factors and the occurrence of in-hospital death. RESULTS: The analysis included 45 studies enrolling 18,300 patients. The pooled estimate of in-hospital mortality was 12% (95% CI 9-15%). The univariable meta-regression analysis showed a significant association between age (coefficient: 1.06; 95% CI 1.04-1.09; p < 0.001), diabetes (coefficient: 1.04; 95% CI 1.02-1.07; p < 0.001) and hypertension (coefficient: 1.01; 95% CI 1.01-1.03; p = 0.013) with in-hospital death. Male sex and smoking did not significantly affect mortality. At multivariable age-adjusted meta-regression analysis, diabetes was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (coefficient: 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.05; p = 0.043); conversely, hypertension was no longer significant after adjustment for age (coefficient: 1.00; 95% CI 0.99-1.01; p = 0.820). A significant association between age and in-hospital mortality was confirmed in all multivariable models. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that older age and diabetes are associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, male sex, hypertension, and smoking did not independently correlate with fatal outcome.","Silverio, Angelo; Di Maio, Marco; Citro, Rodolfo; Esposito, Luca; Iuliano, Giuseppe; Bellino, Michele; Baldi, Cesare; De Luca, Giuseppe; Ciccarelli, Michele; Vecchione, Carmine; Galasso, Gennaro",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,,427

N95 masks and face shields are being used as personal protective equipment to protect from aerosol-related spread of infection. Personal protective equipment, however, hampers communication. This study aimed to assess the effect of using an N95 mask and face shield on speech perception among healthcare workers with normal hearing. METHODS: Twenty healthcare workers were recruited for the study. Pure tone audiometry was conducted to ensure normal hearing. Speech reception threshold and speech discrimination score were obtained, first without using personal protective equipment and then repeated with the audiologist wearing an N95 mask and face shield. RESULTS: A statistically significant increase in speech reception threshold (mean of 12.4 dB) and decrease in speech discrimination score (mean of 7 per cent) was found while using the personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: Use of personal protective equipment significantly impairs speech perception. Alternate communication strategies should be developed for effective communication.","Bandaru, S V; Augustine, A M; Lepcha, A; Sebastian, S; Gowri, M; Philip, A; Mammen, M D",J Laryngol Otol,,427
310571,Covid-19: The inside story of the RECOVERY trial,2020,"Objective: To compare the rate of hospitalizations for pneumonia in patients with a psychotic or bipolar disorder who were prescribed 1 of 4 second-generation antipsychotics prior to admission. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients who were medically admitted for pneumonia to a 2,059-bed academic medical center or its associated health system hospital. Medical records of 872 admissions from November 1, 2016 to December 15, 2018, were included for all adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder prescribed clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone prior to admission. Results: There was no significantly increased risk of pneumonia for patients taking olanzapine (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08, 95% CI, 0.48-2.41) or quetiapine (OR = 0.97, 95% CI, 0.42-2.25) prior to admission compared to risperidone. When controlling for various factors, treatment with a combination of antipsychotics including clozapine (OR = 2.28, 95% CI, 1.13-4.62, P = .022) and clozapine alone (OR = 2.37, 95% CI, 1.30-4.32, P = .005) was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia-related hospitalization compared to treatment with risperidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine alone. Conclusions: The findings of this study in combination with other published literature support an association of an increased risk of pneumonia with the use of clozapine, although this cannot be interpreted as causal. These data show that use of clozapine alone or in combination with other antipsychotics significantly increases risk of pneumonia, although this finding cannot be deemed causal due to study design.","Milano, Victoria R; Kayhart, Bryce M; Morgan, Robert J; DeSimone, Daniel C; Mara, Kristin C; Leung, Jonathan G",Prim. care companion CNS disord.

In addition, to estimate the frequency of these autoantibodies in COVID-19, a meta-analysis of selected articles was conducted. Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 displayed latent autoimmunity mainly mediated by a high frequency of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide third generation antibodies, antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), IgM ß2-glycoprotein I (ß2GP1) and IgM anti-cardiolipin antibodies. The meta-analysis confirmed our results, being RF and ANAs the most common autoantibodies. In addition, cluster analysis revealed that those patients with high positivity for RF, IgM ß2GP1 antibodies and ANAs had a longer hospital stay, required more vasopressors during hospitalization, and were more likely to develop critical disease. These data suggest that latent autoimmunity influences the severity of COVID-19, and support further post-COVID studies in order to evaluate the development of overt autoimmunity.","Anaya, Juan-Manuel; Monsalve, Diana M; Rojas, Manuel; Rodríguez, Yhojan; Montoya-García, Norma; Mancera-Navarro, Laura Milena; Villadiego-Santana, Ana María; Rodríguez-Leguizamón, Giovanni; Acosta-Ampudia, Yeny; Ramírez-Santana, Carolina",J Transl Autoimmun,,427

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases with the keywords ""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"" OR ""2019-nCoV"" AND ""Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion"" OR ""TAPSE"" until January 20, 2021. The main outcome was mortality. The effect estimate was reported as the hazard ratio (HR), which was pooled from the unadjusted and adjusted effect estimates retrieved from the studies included. Mean differences in TAPSE (in mm) between non-survivors and survivors were pooled. RESULTS: In total, 641 patients from seven studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. TAPSE was lower in non-survivors compared with survivors (mean difference = -3.74 [-5.22, -2.26], p < 0.001; I2: 85.5%, p < 0.001). Each 1 mm decrease in TAPSE was associated with increased mortality (HR = 1.24 [1.18, 1.31], p < 0.001; I2: 0.0%, p = 0.491). In the pooled adjusted model, each 1 mm decrease in TAPSE was associated with increased mortality (HR = 1.21 [1.11, 1.33], p < 0.001; I2: 45.1%, p = 0.156). Meta-regression indicated that the difference in TAPSE between non-survivors and survivors was affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (-0.183, p < 0.001) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (-0.344, p = 0.039), but not by age (p = 0.668), male gender (p = 0.821), hypertension (p = 0.101), diabetes (p = 0.603), coronary artery disease (p = 0.564), smoking (p = 0.140), and left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.452).

320168,Mobile Technology Solution for COVID-19: Surveillance and Prevention,2021,"The recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has now spread worldwide and caused more than 51,000 deaths, by April 2nd 2020. As predicted, there are several obstacles for medical and governmental authorities to efficiently manage this respiratory illness. In spite of appropriated supplies, most hospitals are suffering from a scarcity of free beds, protective masks, sanitizing liquids and even ECMO machines for patients with severe cases. Defeating this pandemic is impossible without united and coordinated international attempts shaped by all countries of the world. We believe that an international scaled-determination is required to diminish the complex impacts of pandemic. The most important priorities are supposed to be i) The development of potential vaccine candidates to provide protection and interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, ii) To ensure enough supplies for hospitals and their homogeneous distribution among the countries with the worst number of severe cases, iii) There is a need for more studies to identify potential treatments that are effective for the control of this viral infection and iv) It is imperative to provide easy access to diagnostic kits for all countries affected by this pandemic. In the light of these suggestions, it would be recommendable to at least temporarily abandon the political checkouts in both national and international levels; therefore, all partners will be potentially able to efficiently enforce their strategies for the elimination of this unique threat to the human populations.","Perez Perez, Guillermo I; Talebi Bezmin Abadi, Amin",Arch. med. res,,427
320207,The COVID-19 Infodemic: Twitter versus Facebook,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to find an association between exposure of a population to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and mortality rate due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) across different countries worldwide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To find the relationship between exposure to MERS-CoV and mortality rate due to SARS-CoV-2, we collected and analyzed data of three possible factors that may have resulted in an exposure of a population to MERS-CoV: (1) the number of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) cases reported among 16 countries since 2012; (2) data of MERS-CoV seroprevalence in camels across 23 countries, as working with camels increase risk of exposure to MERS-CoV; (3) data of travel history of people from 51 countries to Saudi Arabia was collected on the assumption that travel to a country where MERS is endemic, such as, Saudi Arabia, could also lead to exposure to MERS-CoV. RESULTS: We found a significantly lower number of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths per million (deaths/M) of a population in countries that are likely to be exposed to MERS-CoV than otherwise (t-stat=3.686, p<0.01). In addition, the number of COVID-19 deaths/M of a population was significantly lower in countries that reported a higher seroprevalence of MERS-CoV in camels than otherwise (t-stat=4.5077, p<0.01). Regression analysis showed that increased travelling history to Saudi Arabia is likely to be associated with a lower mortality rate due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical evidence that a population that was at an increased risk of exposure to MERS-CoV had a significantly lower mortality rate due to SARS-CoV-2, which might be due to cross-protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in that population because of an earlier exposure to MERS-CoV.","Naeem, U; Naeem, A; Naeem, M A; Naeem, K; Mujtaba, B; Mujtaba, A; Khurshid, A",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,427

In earlier self-report studies, increased gambling has been reported by a limited proportion of respondents characterized with a high degree of problem gambling. The present study, carried out with the same methodology and in the same geographical setting, around seven months later in the pandemic, aimed to repeat and to extend the understanding of potential gambling changes in the population during COVID-19. An anonymous sample of web panel members was assessed, altogether 2029 individuals (52% women, 10% moderate-risk or problem gamblers). Results indicated that 6% reported increased gambling, and 4% reported decreased gambling during the pandemic. Having increased gambling was associated with more severe gambling problems (OR 2.78, 95% confidence interval 2.27-3.40), increased alcohol consumption (OR 2.92, 1.71-4.98), and psychological distress (OR 3.38, 1.83-6.23). In the group reporting increased gambling during COVID-19, moderate-risk/problem gambling was very common (62%). Recent governmental policy interventions in the area were known to a minority (30%) of respondents, but awareness of the regulations was markedly more common in individuals with at least moderate-risk gambling (56%) and in self-excluders (78%). Reporting of any perceived influence from policy changes was low (3%), and divided between those reporting an increasing and decreasing effect, respectively. Increased gambling may be a consequence of COVID-19-related changes in everyday lives of individuals with problematic gambling patterns. Thus, a vulnerable group demonstrates higher rates of gambling migration and psychosocial problems, and may require particular attention in screening and treatment contexts, and further scientific evaluations.","Håkansson, Anders; Widinghoff, Carolina",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,427

321724,Reaping the Informational Surplus in Bayesian Persuasion,2020-06-03,"The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has quickly become a worldwide pandemic and generated panic threats for both the human population and the global economy. The unavailability of effective vaccines or drugs has enforced researchers to hunt for a potential drug to combat this virus. Plant-derived phytocompounds are of applicable interest in the search for novel drugs. Bioflavonoids from Rhus succedanea are already reported to exert antiviral activity against RNA viruses. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease plays a vital role in viral replication and therefore can be considered as a promising target for drug development. A computational approach has been employed to search for promising potent bioflavonoids from Rhus succedanea against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease. Binding affinities and binding modes between the biflavonoids and Mpro enzyme suggest that all six biflavonoids exhibit possible interaction with the Mpro catalytic site (-19.47 to -27.04 kcal/mol). However, Amentoflavone (-27.04 kcal/mol) and Agathisflavone (-25.87 kcal/mol) interact strongly with the catalytic residues. Molecular dynamic simulations (100 ns) further revealed that these two biflavonoids complexes with the Mpro enzyme are highly stable and are of less conformational fluctuations. Also, the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface mapping on the Mpro structure as well as biflavonoids were utilized for the further lead optimization process. Altogether, our findings showed that these natural biflavonoids can be utilized as promising SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors and thus, the computational approach provides an initial footstep towards experimental studies in in vitro and in vivo, which is necessary for the therapeutic development of novel and safe drugs to control SARS-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma Research highlights Rhus succedanea biflavonoids have antiviral activity. The molecular interactions and molecular dynamics displayed that all six biflavonoids bound with a good affinity to the same catalytic site of Mpro. The compound Amentoflavone has a strong binding affinity (-27.0441 kcal/mol) towards Mpro. The binding site properties of SARS-CoV-2-Mpro can be utilized in a novel discovery and lead optimization of the SARS-CoV-2-Mpro inhibitor.","Lokhande, Kiran; Nawani, Neelu; K Venkateswara, Swamy; Pawar, Sarika",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,427

To reveal the effects of light on the laying performance of ducks and its possible regulatory mechanisms, Shanma ducks at 52 weeks age were divided into three group treated with different photoperiods of 16 hr (control group), 24 hr (long-photoperiod group, LP), and 8 hr (short-photoperiod group, SP). Laying performance, endocrine-related hormones and gene expression of three groups were compared. The results showed that laying performance was greatest in the LP group; including laying rate, average egg weight and feed-egg ratio. Compared to the SP group, GnIH plasma concentration was decreased in the LP group, whilst FSH was increased in the LP group. GnIHR gene expression in the pituitary and large yellow follicles were downregulated in the LP group. The expression of Mel-a in large white follicles, and Mel-b and Mel-c in the hypothalamus were also downregulated in the LP group. Altogether these results suggest that extended photoperiods may promote the laying performance of ducks by inhibiting the secretion of GnIH and the expression of GnIHR and melatonin receptor genes.","Ouyang, Hongjia; Yang, Bo; Lao, Yongcong; Tang, Jun; Tian, Yunbo; Huang, Yunmao",Vet. med. sci,,427

However, it is not clear how SARS-CoV-2 can cause neurological dysfunctions and which molecular processes are affected in the brain. In this work, we examined the frontal cortex tissue of patients who died of COVID-19 for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, comparing qRT-PCR with ddPCR. We also investigated the transcriptomic profile of frontal cortex from COVID-19 patients and matched controls by RNA-seq analysis to characterize the transcriptional signature. Our data showed that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected by ddPCR in 8 (88%) of 9 examined samples while by qRT-PCR in one case only (11%). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that 11 genes (10 mRNAs and 1 lncRNA) were differential expressed when frontal cortex of COVID-19 patients were compared to controls. These genes fall into categories including hypoxia, hemoglobin-stabilizing protein, hydrogen peroxide processes. This work demonstrated that the quantity of viral RNA in frontal cortex is minimal and it can be detected only with a very sensitive method (ddPCR). Thus, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 does not actively infect and replicate in the brain; its topography within encephalic structures remains uncertain. Moreover, COVID-19 may have a role on brain gene expression, since we observed an important downregulation of genes associated to hypoxia inducting factor system (HIF) that may inhibit the capacity of defense system during infection and oxigen deprivation, showing that hypoxia, well known multi organ condition associated to COVID-19, also marked the brain.","Gagliardi, Stella; Poloni, Emanuele Tino; Pandini, Cecilia; Garofalo, Maria; Dragoni, Francesca; Medici, Valentina; Davin, Annalisa; Visonà, Silvia Damiana; Moretti, Matteo; Sproviero, Daisy; Pansarasa, Orietta; Guaita, Antonio; Ceroni, Mauro; Tronconi, Livio; Cereda, Cristina",Brain behav. immun,,427

326337,Extending the Heston Model to Forecast Motor Vehicle Collision Rates,2021-04-23,"BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, shortages of ventilators and intensive care unit (ICU) beds overwhelmed healthcare systems. Whether early tracheostomy reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay is controversial. RESEARCH QUESTION: Can ""failure-free days"" outcomes focused on ICU resources could help decide the optimal timing of tracheostomy in overburdened healthcare systems during viral epidemics? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia tracheostomized in 15 Spanish ICUs during the surge, when ICU occupancy modified clinicians criteria to perform tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. We compared ventilator-free days at 28 and 60 days and ICU- and hospital bed-free days at 28 and 60-days in propensity-score-matched cohorts tracheostomized at different timings (&#8804;7 days, 8-10 days, 11-14 days after intubation). RESULTS: Of 1939 patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia, 682 (35.2%) were tracheostomized, 382 (56%) within 14 days. Earlier tracheostomy was associated with more ventilator-free days at 28 days [&#8804;7 vs. >7d (116 patients included in the analysis): median 9 days (IQR 0-15) vs. 3 (0-7), difference between groups 4.5 days, 95%CI (2.3 to 6.7); 8-10 vs. >10d (222 patients analysed): 6 (0-10) vs. 0 (0-6), difference 3.1 days, 95%CI (1.7 to 4.5); 11-14 vs. >14d (318 patients analysed): 4 (0-9) vs. 0 (0-2), difference 3 days, 95%CI (2.1 to 3.9)]. Except hospital bed-free days at 28 days, all other endpoints were better in early tracheostomy. INTERPRETATION: Optimal timing of tracheostomy may improve patient outcomes and alleviate ICU capacity strain during the COVID-19 pandemic without increasing mortality. Tracheostomy within the first work on ventilator may particularly improve ICU availability.","Hernandez, G; Ramos, F J; Añon, J M; Ortiz, R; Colinas, L; Masclans, J R; De Haro, C; Ortega, A; Peñuelas, O; Cruz-Delgado, M M; Canabal, A; Plans, O; Vaquero, C; Rialp, G; Gordo, F; Lesmes, A; Martinez, M; Figueira, J C; Gomez-Carranza, A; Corrales, R; Castellvi, A; Castiñeiras, B; Frutos-Vivar, F; Prada, J; De Pablo, R; Naharro, A; Montejo, J C; Diaz, C; Santos-Peral, A; Padilla, R; Marin-Corral, J; Rodriguez-Solis, C; Sanchez-Giralt, J A; Jimenez, J; Cuena, R; Perez-Hoyos, S; Roca, O",Chest,,427

326556,"Inference, prediction and optimization of non-pharmaceutical interventions using compartment models: the PyRoss library",2020-05-19,"Background: Infectious outbreaks, most recently coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have required pervasive public health strategies, termed lockdown measures, including quarantine, social distancing, and closure of workplaces and educational establishments. Although evidence analysing immediate effects is expanding, repercussions following lockdown measures remain poorly understood. This systematic review aims to analyse biopsychosocial consequences after lockdown measures end according to short, medium, and long-term impacts. Methods: PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched from inception to January 12, 2021. Reference lists were manually reviewed. Eligible studies analysed biopsychosocial functioning after lockdown measures secondary to recent infectious outbreaks ended. Lockdown measures were defined as quarantine, isolation, workplace or educational closures, social or physical distancing, and national or local closure of public institutions deemed non-essential. Studies exclusively researching outcomes during lockdown measures, examined infectious participants, or analysed lockdown measures not pertaining to an infectious outbreak were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed bias with a third resolving discrepancies. Data was extracted from published reports with further information requested from authors where necessary. The mixed methods appraisal tool assessed study quality, languages were restricted to English, German, Italian, and French and narrative synthesis was applied. Results: Of 5149 identified studies, 40 were eligible for inclusion. Psychological distress, economic repercussions, social, biological, and behavioural ramifications were observed. Short to medium-term effects comprised reactions relating to early trauma processing whereas medium to long-term repercussions manifested in maladaptive behaviours and mental health deterioration. Increased alcohol intake, stigmatisation, and economic effects were also identified consequences. High-risk groups included health care workers, children, elderly, inpatients, those with pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses, and socially isolated individuals. Conclusions: Supporting vulnerable groups and offering education, workplace modifications, financial, and social assistance may mitigate negative repercussions. Establishing a rapid and comprehensive evidence base appraising the efficacy of such interventions and identifying areas for development is essential. This review was limited by study heterogeneity and lack of randomisation in available literature. Given the unprecedented nature and progression of COVID-19, the relevance of previous outcomes remains uncertain.

This is a cross-sectional studied nested within a child oral health cohort study which collected data regarding children born in 2013 and monitored in Porto Alegre for two years. We applied a questionnaire on maternal variables and frequency of pediatric appointments, weight and height measurements, and children's food intake. To that end, a score was generated based on the points assigned according to SISVAN (meaning 'food and nutrition monitoring system,' run by the Brazilian Ministry of Health). A multivariate model was calculated using Poisson regression with robust variance. The sample comprised 249 children. We found 30.5% (76) of poor/regular dietary quality, which in the multivariate model was associated to the guardian's educational background, considering up to incomplete high school (PR = 2.14, CI95% = 1.03-4.44) and complete high school (PR = 1.70, CI95% = 0.81-3.54), as well as their failure to see a dentist (PR = 2.54, CI95% = 1.33-4.84) or having seen one before the age of four months (PR = 1.94, CI95% = 1.01-3.72). It is our conclusion that failing to see a dentist within the first year of life and lower maternal schooling negatively impact on children's dietary quality.","Freitas, Laura Garcia de; Cortés, Margarita Alexandra Pena; Stein, Caroline; Cousin, Ewerton; Faustino-Silva, Daniel Demétrio; Hilgert, Juliana Balbinot",Cien Saude Colet,,427

327531,Technical Perspectives of Contact-Tracing Applications on Wearables for COVID-19 Control,2020,"The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for the infectious disease caused by coronavirus 19 (COVID-19). The current pandemic is growing worldwide and could affect 50-60% of the world population in the months to come. The most severe disease manifestations are atypical pneumonia and sepsis, but the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the liver, has recently been reported to be affected by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to review the literature available on the topic and provide information about COVID-19, in both healthy and diseased livers, and issue recommendations. The incidence of liver injury specifically associated with COVID-19 varies from 14.8-53%. The majority of case series have reported altered ALT and AST, elevated total bilirubin, and low serum albumin and liver compromise has been associated with the most severe cases of COVID-19. Cirrhosis of the liver has a recognized immune dysfunction status that includes immunodeficiency and systemic inflammation, making it reasonable for those patients to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The recommendations for those patients, in addition to the general measures of physical distancing and handwashing for all persons, include social, medical, and psychologic support during the period of home quarantine to prevent lapses in treatment. Patients should be made aware that they need to keep abreast of changes in recommendations and social policies.","Velarde-Ruiz Velasco, J A; García-Jiménez, E S; Remes-Troche, J M",Rev Gastroenterol Mex,,427

METHODS: Prostatic aspirated cells were obtained immediately after transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided needle biopsy. Cellular RNA such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA, prostate specific antigen (PSA) mRNA and prostate-specific RNA (PCA3) mRNA were analyzed by using Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). PCA3 score was calculated as the ratio of PCA3 mRNA to PSA mRNA expression. Diagnostic performance of the fast-aspirated cellular RNA analysis technique for determining prostate cancer and metastatic status were evaluated by developing receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), and the correlation between aspirated cellular RNA mRNA expressions and risk grouping was calculated, to investigate the underlying potential for PCa staging. RESULTS: PCA3 score was significantly higher in prostatic aspirated cells obtained from cancerous tissues than noncancerous tissues. The median aspirated cellular PCA3 score was higher in patients with PCa compared to BPH, and presenting an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.87 (95%CI: 0.79-0.94) for PCa diagnosis. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that baseline median aspirated cellular PCA3 score (OR=9.316, 95%CI: 1.045-83.033, P<0.05) was an independent predictive factor for metastatic status in PCa patients. CONCLUSION: The ease of use and minimal complexity of fast prostatic aspirated cellular RNA analysis may be a valuable diagnostic technique, providing urgent diagnostic information for accurate PCa diagnosing and staging.","Sang, Yiwen; Wang, Xuchu; Yu, Pan; Zhang, Luyan; Dai, Yibei; Zhang, Lingyu; Wang, Danhua; Liu, Zhenping; Wang, Yao; Tao, Zhihua",Transl Oncol,,427

METHODS: We studied 94 non-obese, non-diabetic, Japanese men. Using a two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, we evaluated insulin sensitivity in muscle and liver. Intrahepatic lipid and fat distribution were measured using 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. We divided the subjects into risk carrying group with ALDH2 rs671 G/G (n=53) and non-risk carrying group with ALDH2 rs671 G/A or A/A (n=41). RESULTS: The risk carrying group had significantly higher levels of alcohol consumption (18.4 (IQR, 10.4-48.9) vs. 12.1(IQR, 1.3-29.0) g/day; P=0.003), elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (97.5±7.9 vs. 93.5±6.2 mg/dL; P=0.010), lower hepatic insulin sensitivity (61.7±20.5% vs.73.1±15.9%; P=0.003) and lower fasting glucose clearance (0.84±0.8 dL·m -2·min -1 vs. 0.87±0.09 dL·m -2·min -1; P=0.047) than the non-risk carrying group, while insulin resistance in muscle and body fat distribution were similar. The single linear correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between alcohol consumption and hepatic insulin sensitivity (r=-0.262, P=0.011), fasting glucose clearance (r=-0.370, P<0.001) or FPG (r=0.489, P<0.001). The multiple regression analysis revealed that both ALDH2 rs671 G/G genotype and alcohol consumption were significant independent correlates for hepatic insulin sensitivity, while only alcohol consumption was a significant independent correlate for fasting glucose clearance. CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that high-alcohol-intake dependent and independent hepatic insulin resistance and reduced fasting glucose clearance due to high alcohol intake could be a relatively upstream metabolic abnormality in ALDH2 rs671 G/G carriers.","Takeno, Kageumi; Tamura, Yoshifumi; Kakehi, Saori; Kaga, Hideyoshi; Kawamori, Ryuzo; Watada, Hirotaka",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,427
329169,Harboring hope: sustaining resilience in a post-COVID world,2021,"We argue that frequent sampling of the fraction of a priori non-symptomatic but infectious humans (either by random or cohort testing) significantly improves the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, when compared to intervention strategies relying on data from symptomatic cases only. This is because such sampling measures the incidence of the disease, the key variable controlled by restrictive measures, and thus anticipates the load on the healthcare system due to progression of the disease. The frequent testing of non-symptomatic infectiousness will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates. These advantages are quantified by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where the feed-back is derived from the evolution of the daily measured prevalence. While the basic model we propose aggregates data for the entire population of a country such as Switzerland, we point out generalizations which account for hot spots which are analogous to (Anderson) localized regions in the theory of diffusion in random media.","Müller, Markus; Derlet, Peter M; Mudry, Christopher; Aeppli, Gabriel",Phys. biol,,427

331057,No peace from corona: defining EU strategy for the 2020s,2020,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for health systems around the world. We describe our approach to adapting the pharmacy leadership structure to address critical medication shortages through innovative data analysis, procurement strategies, and rapid implementation of medication policy. SUMMARY: Yale New Haven Health deployed a system incident management command structure to effectively respond to the COVID-19 crisis. System pharmacy services adopted a similar framework to enable efficient communication and quick decision-making in key domains, including drug procurement and policy. By refining a model to project health-system medication needs, we were able to anticipate challenges and devise alternative treatment algorithms. By leveraging big data and creating a system knowledge base, we were able to consolidate reporting and coordinate efforts to ensure system success. Various procurement strategies were employed to ensure adequate supply, including frequent communication with our wholesaler, sourcing direct from suppliers, outsourcing of sterile products compounding to registered 503B outsourcing facilities, and acquisition of active pharmaceutical ingredients for compounding of essential medications. Strategic positioning of pharmacists within the health system's incident command response teams and rapid adaption of drug use policy governance fueled accelerated response and nimble implementation. Communication was streamlined and executed via multiple outlets to reach a broad audience across the health system. CONCLUSION: With medication shortages posing a threat to patient care, dynamic pharmacy leadership proved essential to providing patient care at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. System alignment and the rapid adaption of the existing framework for drug shortage management and medication use policy were crucial to success in crisis response.","Pulk, Rebecca Ann; Leber, Molly; Tran, Lydia; Ammar, Mahmoud; Amin, Nilesh; Miller, LeeAnn; Yazdi, Marina",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,427

Chronic absenteeism due to health concerns was identified as a barrier to academic success. METHODS: The DOE and a public university created Hawaii Keiki: Healthy and Ready to Learn (HK), a program to provide school-based services for 170 Title 1 schools in urban and rural settings and build momentum for statewide collective action. HK has maintained support from public and private entities to address student health. RESULTS: This paper describes 5 years of program development, implementation, and continuing challenges. Most recently in 2020-2021, HK pivoted in the face of school campus closings due to COVID-19 with strategic plans, including telehealth, to move forward in this changed school environment. CONCLUSIONS: The HK program has increased awareness of students' needs and is addressing the imperative to build health services within public schools. The multipronged approach of building awareness of need, providing direct services, educating future care providers, and supporting sound policy development, has an impact that goes beyond any one individual area.","Davis, Katherine Finn; Loos, Joanne R; Boland, Mary G",J Sch Health,,427

The influences of indoor air velocity, the type, size distribution, residence time in air, and trajectory of the droplets, were all considered while interrogating the effectiveness of physical distancing measures, the use of face covers, cautionary activities of the general public, and the plausibility of community spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through airborne transmission. Series of 3-D, coupled, discrete phase models (DPM) were implemented in the numerical studies. Based on DPM concentration maps as function of particle positions and particle residence times that were observed under different droplets release conditions, the virus-laden droplets could travel several meters away from the source of release (index patient), with smaller-sized particles staying longer in the air. The behavior of indoor air was also found to indicate complex dynamics as particle transports showed no linear dependence on air velocity.

Although the current focus is on the management of acute COVID-19, there is growing concern about long-term effects of COVID-19 (Long Covid), such as fibroproliferative changes in the lung, heart and kidney. Therefore, the identification of therapeutic targets not only for the management of acute COVID-19 but also for preventing Long Covid are needed, and would mitigate against long-lasting health burden and economic costs, in addition to saving lives. COVID-19 induces pathological changes via multiple pathways, which could be targeted simultaneously for optimal effect.

332370,Scalable Telehealth Services to Combat Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,2021,"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated drastic and rapid changes throughout the field of radiation oncology, some of which were unique to the discipline of radiosurgery. Guidelines called for reduced frame use and reducing the number of fractions. Our institution implemented these guidelines, and herein we show the resultant effect on patient treatments on our Gamma Knife Icon program. Methods: In early March 2020 we rapidly implemented suggested changes according to ASTRO and other consensus guidelines as they relate to stereotactic radiosurgery in the COVID-19 era. We reviewed the GK Icon schedule at our institution between January 01 and April 30, 2020. We documented age, condition treated, technique (frame vs. mask), and number of fractions. We then tabulated and graphed the number of patients, framed cases, and fractions delivered. Results: Seventy-seven patients were treated on the GK Icon over that period, for a total of 231 fractions. The number of unique patients varied from 18 (April) to 22 (January). Of the 77 patients only 5 were treated using a frame. The number of fractions per month decreased significantly over time, from 70 in January to 36 in April. Likewise, the percentage of single fraction cases increased from 4.5% per month in January to 67% in April. Conclusions: The results presented here show that it is possible to quickly and efficiently change work flows to allow for reduced fractionation and frame use in the time of a global pandemic. Multidisciplinary cooperation and ongoing communication are integral to the success of such programs.","Wegner, Rodney E; Horne, Zachary D; Xu, Linda; Yu, Alexander; Goss, Matthew; Liang, Yun; Sohn, Jason; Colonias, Athanasios; Fuhrer, Russell; Karlovits, Stephen M",J Radiosurg SBRT,,427

Evidence-based immunization policies and practices are responsible for this success and are supported by epidemiology that has generated scientific evidence for informing policy and practice. The purpose of this report is to highlight the role of epidemiology in the development of immunization policy and successful intervention in public health practice that has resulted in a measurable public health impact: the control and elimination of VPDs in the United States. Examples in which epidemiology informed immunization policy were collected from a literature review and consultation with experts who have been working in this field for the past 30 years. Epidemiologic examples (e.g., thimerosal-containing vaccines and the alleged association between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism) are presented to describe challenges that epidemiologists have addressed. Finally, we describe ongoing challenges to the nation's ability to sustain high vaccination coverage, particularly with concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness, increasing use of religious and philosophical belief exemptions to vaccination, and vaccine hesitancy. Learning from past and current experiences may help epidemiologists anticipate and address current and future challenges to respond to emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, with new vaccines and enhance public health impact of immunization programs for years to come.","Carter-Pokras, O; Hutchins, S; Gaudino, J A; Veeranki, S P; Lurie, P; Weiser, T; DeMarco, M; Khan, N F; Cordero, J F",Ann. epidemiol,,427

335112,Looking Beyond the Walls for Clinical Experiences,2020,"The number of COVID-19 patients is still growing exponentially worldwide due to the high transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therapeutic agents currently under investigation are antiviral drugs, vaccines, and other adjuvants that could relieve symptoms or improve the healing process. In this review, twelve therapeutic agents that could play a role in prophylaxis or improvement of the COVID-19-associated symptoms (as add-on substances) are discussed. Agents were identified based on their known pharmacologic mechanism of action in viral and/or nonviral fields and are postulated to interact with one or more of the seven known mechanisms associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus: (i) regulation of the immune system; (ii) virus entrance in the cell; (iii) virus replication; (iv) hyperinflammation; (v) oxidative stress; (vi) thrombosis; and (vii) endotheliitis. Selected agents were immune transfer factor (oligo- and polypeptides from porcine spleen, ultrafiltered at <10 kDa; Imuno TF®), anti-inflammatory natural blend (Uncaria tomentosa, Endopleura uchi and Haematoccocus pluvialis; Miodesin®), zinc, selenium, ascorbic acid, cholecalciferol, ferulic acid, spirulina, N-acetylcysteine, glucosamine sulfate potassium hydrochloride, trans-resveratrol, and maltodextrin-stabilized orthosilicic acid (SiliciuMax®).

335247,Leadership During Crisis: An Examination of Supervisory Leadership Behavior and Gender During COVID-19,2021,"Shared resource extraction among profit-seeking individuals involves a tension between individual benefit and the collective well-being represented by the persistence of the resource. Many game theoretic models explore this scenario, but these models tend to assume either best response dynamics (where individuals instantly switch to better paying strategies) or imitation dynamics (where individuals copy successful strategies from neighbours), and do not systematically compare predictions under the two assumptions. Here we propose an iterated game on a social network with payoff functions that depend on the state of the resource. Agents harvest the resource, and the strategy composition of the population evolves until an equilibrium is reached. The system is then repeatedly perturbed and allowed to re-equilibrate. We compare model predictions under best response and imitation dynamics. Compared to imitation dynamics, best response dynamics increase sustainability of the system, the persistence of cooperation while decreasing inequality and debt corresponding to the Gini index in the agents' cumulative payoffs. Additionally, for best response dynamics, the number of strategy switches before equilibrium fits a power-law distribution under a subset of the parameter space, suggesting the system is in a state of self-organized criticality. We find little variation in most mean results over different network topologies; however, there is significant variation in the distributions of the raw data, equality of payoff, clustering of like strategies and power-law fit. We suggest the primary mechanisms driving the difference in sustainability between the two strategy update rules to be the clustering of like strategies as well as the time delay imposed by an imitation processes. Given the strikingly different outcomes for best response versus imitation dynamics for common-pool resource systems, our results suggest that modellers should choose strategy update rules that best represent decision-making in their study systems.","Farahbakhsh, Isaiah; Bauch, Chris T; Anand, Madhur",J Theor Biol,,427

Passive antibody administration by transfusion of convalescent plasma is currently in clinical evaluations to treat COVID-19 patients. The level of neutralizing antibodies vary among convalescent patients and fast and simple methods to identify suitable plasma donations are needed. We compared three methods to determine the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity of human convalescent plasma: life virus neutralization by plaque reduction assay, a lentiviral vector based pseudotype neutralization assay and a competition ELISA-based surrogate virus neutralization assay (sVNT). Neutralization activity correlated among the different assays; however the sVNT assay was overvaluing the low neutralizing plasma. On the other hand, the sVNT assay required the lowest biosafety level, is fast and is sufficient to identify highly neutralizing plasma samples. Though weakly neutralizing samples were more reliable detected by the more challenging lentiviral vector based assays or virus neutralization assays. Spike receptor binding competition assays are suitable to identify highly neutralizing plasma samples under low biosafety requirements. Detailed analysis of in vitro neutralization activity requires more sophisticated methods that have to be performed under higher biosafety levels.","von Rhein, Christine; Scholz, Tatjana; Henss, Lisa; Kronstein-Wiedemann, Romy; Schwarz, Tatjana; Rodionov, Roman N; Corman, Victor M; Tonn, Torsten; Schnierle, Barbara S",J Virol Methods,,427

Nevertheless, However, the changes of gaseous pollutant concentrations and health effects across China during the COVID-19 lockdown period remained poorly understood. Here, a random forest (RF) model was applied to assess the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on pollutant concentrations and potential health effects. The results suggested that estimated NO2, SO2, and CO concentrations in China during January 23-March 31, 2020 decreased by 13.68%, 25.71%, and 7.42%, respectively compared with the same periods in 2018-2019. Nonetheless, the predicted 8-h O3 concentrations across China suffered from 1.29% increases during this period. The avoided premature all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), respiratory disease (RD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortalities induced by NO2 decrease during COVID-19 lockdown period reached 3954 (3076 - 4832), 635 (468 - 801), 612 (459 - 765), and 920 (653 - 1186) cases. However, the increases of all-cause, CVD, RD, and COPD mortalities due to O3 increase during COVID-19 lockdown period achieved 462 (250 - 674), 79 (29 - 129), 40 (-25 - 105), and 52 (-34 - 138) cases. The natural experiment demonstrated the drastic emission reduction measures could significantly decrease the NO2, SO2, and CO concentrations, while they significantly elevated the O3 concentration.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 at a referral centre in Madrid, Spain, during March-May 2020 was performed. Recorded variables (age, gender, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, outcome), and geographical area of origin were compared for Europeans and non-Europeans (Latin Americans, Asians and Africans). RESULTS: In total, 2345 patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized during the study period were included in the study. Of these, 1956 (83.4%) were European and 389 (16.6%) were non-European (of whom over 90%, 354/389, were Latin American). Non-Europeans were significantly younger than Europeans (mean 54 (SD 13.5) versus 70.4 (SD 15.1) years, p < 0.001); the majority were male (1420/2345, 60.6%), with no significant differences in gender between Europeans and non-Europeans (1197/1956 (61.2%) male in the European group versus 223/389 (57.3%) male in the non-European group, p 0.15). In-hospital mortality overall was higher in Europeans (443/1956, 22.7%) than in non-Europeans (40/389, 10.3%) (p < 0.001), but there were no significant differences when adjusted for age/gender (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.86-1.88).

Scholarship of public transit has largely explored outcome-based research while paying less attention to how decisions are made. Despite some transport scholarship that shows how institutional characteristics influence financing, power arrangements and public discourse, there has been little recent analysis of governance within public transit systems beyond the regional role of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs). Using data from multiple sources, we assembled a database of governance structure of transit systems in the largest 40 cities in the United States. We show that the structure of transit decision making has substantial variance across and within cities, and is far from limited to MPOs. The variety of governance models and growth of local and sub-local models suggest that local context is critical for better understanding transit priorities and decision-making processes.","Lauren Ames, Fischer Rosalie Singerman Ray King David A.",Urban Science,,427
341242,Ethical decision making during a healthcare crisis: a resource allocation framework and tool,2021,"The latest global outbreak of 2019 respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is triggered by the inception of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2. If recent events are of any indicators of the epidemics of past, it is undeniable to state a fact that the SARS-CoV2 viral infection is highly transmissible with respect to its previously related SARS-CoV's. Papain-like protease (PLpro) is an enzyme that is required by the virus itself for replicating into the host system; and it does so by processing its polyproteins into a functional replicase complex. PLpro is also known for downregulating the genes responsible for producing interferons, an essential family of molecules produced in response to viral infection, thus making this protein an indispensable drug target. In this study, PLpro inhibitors were identified through high throughput structure-based virtual screening approach from NPASS natural product library possessing ~ 35,000 compounds. Top five hits were scrutinised based on structural aromaticity and ability to interact with a key active site residue of PLpro, Tyr268. For second level of screening, the MM-GBSA End-Point Binding Free Energy Calculation of the docked complexes was performed, which identified Caesalpiniaphenol A as the best hit. Caesalpiniaphenol A not only possess a double ring aromatic moiety but also has lowest minimum binding energy, which is at par with the control GRL0617, the only known inhibitor of SARS-CoV2 PLpro. Details of the Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation and ADMET analysis helped to conclusively determine Caesalpiniaphenol A as potentially an inhibitor of SARS-CoV2 PLpro.","Parmar, Paritosh; Rao, Priyashi; Sharma, Abhilasha; Shukla, Arpit; Rawal, Rakesh M; Saraf, Meenu; Patel, Baldev V; Goswami, Dweipayan",Mol. divers,,427

344192,Transmission and control pressure analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic situation using multisource spatio-temporal big data,2021,"After decades of notoriety for its adverse cardiovascular, proinflammatory and profibrotic actions, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) began to be cast in a more favorable light with the discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in 2000. This monocarboxypeptidase, best known for its ability to metabolize angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang 1-7, counteracts the adverse effects of Ang II mediated by the AT1 Ang II receptor. Ang peptides are classically considered to be metabolized by aminopeptidases, by which the nomenclature Ang III (des-Asp1Ang II, 2-8 heptapeptide) and Ang IV (des-Asp1des-Arg2Ang II, 3-8 hexapeptide) are derived. This report compares the ability of recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) to metabolize Ang III, Ang IV and Ang V, (4-8 pentapeptide) relative to Ang II to form corresponding des-omega-Phe metabolites. rhACE2 has highest affinity (lowest Km) for Ang III, followed by Ang II â¼ Ang V, followed by Ang IV. However, rhACE2 has the highest Kcat for metabolising Ang IV followed by Ang V, Ang III and Ang II. The enzymatic efficiency (Kcat/Km) is highest for Ang V and Ang III followed by Ang IV and is lowest for Ang II. As a gluzincin metallopeptidase, ACE2 requires a zinc molecule at its active site for catalysis. This report also documents inhibition of ACE2 activity by concentrations of zinc exceeding 10 µM. These observations extend the functional significance of ACE2 to include the metabolic inactivation of Ang III, Ang IV and Ang V, reemphasizing the importance of monitoring zinc intake to maintain metabolic homeostasis.","Polak, Yasmin; Speth, Robert C",Peptides,,427

345234,"The socio-economic impacts of Covid-19 restrictions: Data from the coastal city of Mombasa, Kenya",2020,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus, now termed SARS-CoV-2, has had a significant impact on cardiac surgical services globally. Although drastically reduced, our institution has maintained a significant level of cardiac surgical activity during the pandemic. Rigorous COVID-19 guidelines have been instituted to mitigate the risk of viral transmission. We observed a reduction in sternal wound infections since the institution of new perioperative surgical guidelines. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution since a national lockdown was declared in March 2020. A retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent cardiac surgery in the 12 months preceding the national lockdown, as a baseline cohort group, was also performed. RESULTS: A total of 2600 patients (493 during the COVID-19 pandemic) were included in this study. Urgent/emergency procedures accounted for more than 60% of procedures performed during the lockdown compared to 39% previously. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were 4 sternal wound infections with an overall incidence of 0.8%. In comparison, the incidence of sternal wound infections was significantly higher at 3.0% in the 12-month period prior to lockdown with 63 sternal wound infections (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: This report suggests a significant role of iatrogenic causes in sternal wound infections prior to the pandemic. The strict implementation of guidelines in the perioperative period suggests that sternal wound infections can be prevented. We propose that the now widespread COVID-19 guidelines to reduce transmission risk be adapted to help reduce the incidence of sternal wound infections.","Hussain, Azhar; Ike, David I; Durand-Hill, Matthieu; Ibrahim, Sammra; Roberts, Neil",Asian Cardiovasc Thorac Ann,,427

The Seattle Washington metropolitan area was one of the first in the United States affected by the pandemic. As a result, the anatomic pathology services at the University of Washington experienced significant changes in operational volumes early in the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of COVID-19 and both state and institutional policies implemented to mitigate viral transmission (including institutional policies on non-urgent procedures) on anatomic pathology volumes. DESIGN: Accessioned specimens from January 2020 to June 2020 was evaluated as COVID-19 and institutional policies changed. The data were considered in these contexts: subspecialty, billable CPT codes, and intraoperative consultation. Comparable data were retrieved from 2019 as a historical control. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in overall accessioned volume (up to 79%) from pre-pandemic levels, during bans on non-urgent procedures when compared to 2020 pre- COVID-19 volumes and historical controls. The gastrointestinal and dermatopathology services were most impacted, while breast and combined head&neck/pulmonary services were least impacted. CPT code 88305, for smaller/biopsy specimens, had a 63% reduction during non-urgent procedure bans. After all bans on procedures were lifted, the overall volume plateaued at 89% of pre-pandemic levels. CONCLUSIONS: A significant decrease in specimen volume was most strongly associated with bans on non-urgent procedures. While all departmental areas had a decrease in volume, the extent of change varied across subspecialty and specimen types. Even with removing all bans, service volume did not reach pre-pandemic levels.","Miller, Timothy Isaac; Smith, Kelly D; Gonzalez-Cuyar, Luis Francisco; Swanson, Paul E",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

345738,Measuring an adaptive change in human decision-making from AI: Application to evaluate changes after AlphaGo,2020-12-30,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic influences health care facilities world-wide. The flow rate, type, and severity of cases presented to emergency departments varied during the pandemic in comparison to the past years. However, this change has not been well-described among the cases of hospital admission due to toxic exposure. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Recognition of the pattern of toxic exposure among the cases refereed to Tanta Poison Control Center (TPCC; Tanta, Egypt) during the past five years, and furthermore, exploration of the impact of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the pattern of presented cases. METHODS: The current study is a five-year retrospective, comparative cross-sectional study carried out among acutely intoxicated patients admitted to TPCC during the spring months (March through May) of 2016-2020. A total of 1,916 patients with complete medical records were recruited. The type and manner of toxic exposure, demographic, clinical data, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The current study noted that there were delays in time from toxic exposure to emergency services during the lockdown period. This was reflected in significant lower recovery rates (884.8/1,000 population; z = -3.0) and higher death rates (49.4/1,000 population; z = 2.1) despite the marked decrease in the total number of hospital admissions in comparison to the past four years. The lockdown period showed significantly higher phosphides (z = 3.5; &#967;2 = 34.295; P <.001) and antipsychotics exposure (z = 3.6; &#967;2 = 21.494; P <.001) than the previous years. However, predominance of female exposure and intentional self-poisoning was maintained over the past five years, including the lockdown. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-associated lockdown greatly reformed the usual intoxication pattern of the cases admitted to emergency room. Also, it played a role in delaying time of hospital arrival, which was reflected as lower recovery rates and higher death rates.","Fayed, Manar M; Sharif, Asmaa F",Prehosp Disaster Med,,427
345882,Australian debate of the China question: the COVID-19 case,2021,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the clinical features, laboratory findings and primary outcomes of the neonates with RSV and neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This nested case-control study included the neonates who were administered in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the University of Health Sciences, Dr Behçet Uz Children's Hospital during the period of 01 March-30 April 2020. Respiratory PCR samples and COVID-19 samples were taken simultaneously. Only RSV positive and COVID-19 positive infants were compared. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical data were obtained from hospital electronic information system medical records. The chest radiographs at the admission were evaluated by using standard definitions for normal chest X-ray, atelectasis, bronchopenumonia, peribronchial thickening and hyperinflation in various lung volumes. RESULTS: A total of 30 infants were enrolled in the study and RSV was identified in 20/30 infants (66%). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of general characteristics. Comparing to the infants with Covid-19 infections, infants with RSV infections had significantly higher rates of having oxygen support (p = .03). Total NICU duration time was 6.7 ± 1.6 days in COVID positive group and 11.1 ± 5.1 days in the RSV group (p = .01). Infants with COVID-19 had more normal chest X-rays. Infants with RSV-positive had a significantly higher proportion of atelectasis than those with COVID-19 infants (p = .04). DISCUSSION: This is the first study that compares RSV infection and COVID-19 infection. RSV infection can be more serious in the neonatal period. In cases with suspected COVID-19 infection, it should be kept in mind if atelectasis is seen on chest radiography. Respiratory failure may be more serious in RSV positive infants and RSV infection may be more dangerous for the neonatal period.","Alkan Ozdemir, Senem; Soysal, Buse; Calkavur, Sebnem; Gökmen Yildirim, Tülin; Kiymet, Elif; Kalkanli, Oguzhan; Çolak, Rüya; Devrim, Ilker",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,427

However, studies on the infection status of medical personnel are still lacking. It is imperative to ensure the safety of health-care workers (HCWs) not only to safeguard continuous patient care but also to ensure they do not transmit the virus, therefore evaluation of infection rates in these groups are indicated. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data regarding infected cases among HCWs of Fars, Iran with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were obtained from 10th March to 17th May 2020. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated a rate of 5.62% (273 out of 4854 cases) infection among HCW, with a mean age of 35 years and a dominance of female cases (146 cases: 53.5%). The majority of infected cases were among nurses (51.3%), while the most case infection rate (CIR) was among physicians (27 positive cases out of 842 performed test (3.2%)). Also, the highest rate of infection was in the emergency rooms (30.6%). Also, 35.5% of the patients were asymptomatic and the most frequent clinical features among symptomatic patients were myalgia (46%) and cough (45.5%). Although 5.5% were admitted to hospitals, there were no reports of ICU admission. Furthermore, 10.3% of the cases reported transmitting the infection to family and friends. Regarding safety precautions, 1.6% didn't wear masks and 18.7% didn't use gloves in work environments. CONCLUSION: HCWs are among the highest groups at risk of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic; therefore, evaluating infection rates and associated features is necessary to improve and adjust protective measures of these vulnerable, yet highly essential group.","Sabetian, Golnar; Moghadami, Mohsen; Hashemizadeh Fard Haghighi, Leila; Shahriarirad, Reza; Fallahi, Mohammad Javad; Asmarian, Naeimehossadat; Moeini, Yalda Sadat",Virol J,,427

Global efforts have been exerted to prevent the spreading of the disease through political decisions together with personal behaviors, which depend on awareness of the public. The goal of this study is to assess the knowledge, perceptions and attitude of the Egyptian public towards the COVID-19 disease. We conducted a cross-sectional survey about these points, which was distributed among adult Egyptians. Five hundred and fifty nine persons completed the survey. The mean knowledge score was 16.39 out of 23, gained mainly though social media (66.9%), and the internet (58.3%). Knowledge was significantly lower among older, less educated, lower income participants, and rural residents. Most participants (86.9%) were concerned about the risk of infection. While 37.6% thought that their salary will be continued if they become isolated, 68.5% believed that it should be continued during this period. About 73.0% were looking forward to get the vaccine when available. In general, participants had a good knowledge about the disease and a positive attitude towards protective measures. This knowledge is gained mainly through novel media channels, which have pros and cons. Although the government has taken major steps to educate the public and limit the spread of the disease, more effort is needed to educate and support the lower economic strata. If a vaccine or a treatment is approved, we recommend a government control over its use to preserve the rights of the vulnerable and needy groups.","Abdelhafiz, Ahmed Samir; Mohammed, Zeinab; Ibrahim, Maha Emad; Ziady, Hany H; Alorabi, Mohamed; Ayyad, Mohamed; Sultan, Eman A",J Community Health,,427

348719,What is the right price of a European option in an incomplete market?,2020-12-17,"Activated neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in response to a variety of stimuli. NETosis is driven by protein-arginine deiminase type 4, with the release of intracellular granule components that function by capturing and destroying microbes, including viral, fungal, bacterial, and protozoal pathogens. The positive effects of pathogen control are countered by pro-inflammatory effects as demonstrated in a variety of diseases. Components of NETS are non-specific, and other than controlling microbes, they cause injury to surrounding tissue by themselves or by increasing the pro-inflammatory response. NETs can play a role in enhancement of the inflammation seen in autoimmune diseases including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosis. In addition, autoinflammatory diseases such as gout have been associated with NETosis. Inhibition of NETs may decrease the severity of many diseases improving survival. Herein, we describe NETosis in different diseases focusing on the detrimental effect of NETs and outline possible therapeutics that can be used to mitigate netosis. There is a need for more studies and clinical trials on these and other compounds that could prevent or destroy NETs, thereby decreasing damage to patients.","Mutua, Victoria; Gershwin, Laurel J",Clin. rev. allergy immunol,,427

Male and female patients had a high percentage of prostate (39.3%) and breast (32%) cancer respectively. Prostate cancer (18.9%) and myeloma (11.3%) were common among solid and hematological cancers respectively. Hypertension and smoking were prevalent among cancer (83% and 41.5%) compared to non-cancer (67.4% and 9.6%) patients. The common symptoms in cancer patients were dyspnea (64.2%) followed by fever and cough (50.9%) compared to fever (68.1%) and cough (66.7%) in non-cancer patients. Cancer patients had higher levels of lactic acidosis, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase than non-cancer patients (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Rapid clinical deterioration was seen in cancer patients who were aged 60 years and above. Higher mortality was seen in this subgroup, especially when they had associated hypertension and elevated levels of CRP and LDH.","Ramachandran, Preethi; Kathirvelu, Balachandar; Chakraborti, Abhishek; Gajendran, Mahesh; Zhahid, Umar; Ghanta, Snigdha; Onukogu, Ifeanyichkwu; Narh, Joshua Tetteh; Wang, Jen C; Anwer, Faiz",Cancer Control,,427

349098,Academia in a Time of Pandemic: An Australian Perspective,2020,"INTRODUCTION: residual lung injury in patients recovering from COVID-19 information is scarce. Herein, we present a previous confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection case series including five patients, who underwent either open or transbronchial lung biopsy due to no clinical improvement. DESCRIPTION: Case 1: a 73-year-old male patient initially asymptomatic, with positive RT-PCR after transurethral resection of the prostate. Consulted for dyspnea and room air desaturation after 24 days during postoperative. Chest computed tomography reported findings compatible with organizing pneumonia, then a transbronchial biopsy was performed confirming diagnosis. Case 2: a 48-year-old male patient with COVID-19 pneumonia who required 14 days hospitalization. He was readmitted after 25 days since initial symptoms due to dyspnea and room air desaturation with a chest CT that revealed findings suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, an open lung biopsy was performed with a probable usual interstitial pneumonia pattern report. Case 3: a 86-year-old male patient, with initial mild COVID-19 infection who later progressed to severe pneumonia requiring high levels of supplemental oxygen. At 18 days of admission, due to persistent clinical compromise, a chest CT was performed with findings of organizing pneumonia. Therefore, he was taken to transbronchial lung biopsy that revealed non-specific interstitial pneumonia in the fibrosing phase. Case 4: a 61-year-old male patient with HIV/AIDS infection presented acute respiratory distress syndrome due to severe COVID-19 pneumonia with inability to withdraw invasive mechanical ventilation after one month. An open lung biopsy was performed with histopathology diagnosis of diffuse alveolar damage in the proliferative phase.Case 5: 41-year-old male patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, with persistent use of high levels of supplemental oxygen after 30 days since symptomatic. The chest CT suggested pulmonary fibrosis;therefore, an open lung biopsy was performed and confirmed Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia. DISCUSSION: to date, reports of interstitial lung disease due to COVID-19 refer to imaging findings or post-mortem histopathological studies which have been relatively limited given the strict guidelines and restrictions for performing bronchoscopies and lung surgery during the pandemic. The foregoing highlights the importance of tissue analysis under rigorous safety protocols in order to provide an early detection of interstitial lung involvement secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection and then evaluate a prolonged steroid treatment recommendation.","Espinal Martínez, A.; Enciso, L.

349347,Drug repositioning based on similarity constrained probabilistic matrix factorization: COVID-19 as a case study,2021,"While digital divide studies primarily focused on access to information and communications technology (ICT) in the past, its influence on other associated dimensions such as privacy is becoming critical with a far-reaching impact on the people and society. For example, the various levels of government legislation and compliance on information privacy worldwide have created a new era of digital divide in the privacy preservation domain. In this article, the concept""digital privacy divide (DPD)""is introduced to describe the perceived gap in the privacy preservation of individuals based on the geopolitical location of different countries. To better understand the DPD phenomenon, we created an online questionnaire and collected answers from more than 700 respondents from four different countries (the United States, Germany, Bangladesh, and India) who come from two distinct cultural orientations as per Hofstede's individualist vs. collectivist society. However, our results revealed some interesting findings. DPD does not depend on Hofstede's cultural orientation of the countries. For example, individuals residing in Germany and Bangladesh share similar privacy concerns, while there is a significant similarity among individuals residing in the United States and India. Moreover, while most respondents acknowledge the importance of privacy legislation to protect their digital privacy, they do not mind their governments to allow domestic companies and organizations collecting personal data on individuals residing outside their countries, if there are economic, employment, and crime prevention benefits. These results suggest a social dilemma in the perceived privacy preservation, which could be dependent on many other contextual factors beyond government legislation and countries' cultural orientation.","Alhazmi, Hamoud; Imran, Ahmed; Alsheikh, Mohammad Abu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02669v1.pdf,427

METHODS: In March 2020, we searched 5 databases for literature exploring the psychological consequences of the crisis. Main findings were extracted. RESULTS: 32 citations were screened and 11 included in the review. Results suggest a negative psychological effect caused by the water crisis, including anxiety and health worries, exacerbated by lowered trust in public health officials, uncertainty about the long-term impacts of the crisis, financial hardships, stigma, and difficulties seeking help. There was evidence that concerns about tap water continued even after the state of emergency was lifted. CONCLUSIONS: With a possible compound effect to residents of Flint with the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the results highlight the need for more resources for psychological health interventions in Flint as well as a need for local governments and health authorities to regain the trust of those affected by the Flint Water Crisis.","Brooks, Samantha K; Patel, Sonny S",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,427

Concebendo-a em sentido amplo, a vulnerabilidade se relaciona à suscetibilidade social e econômica a riscos ou perdas potenciais, causados por eventos extremos. Nesse contexto, este artigo objetiva identificar a vulnerabilidade socioeconômica dos municípios do Ceará, epicentro da região Nordeste, quanto à pandemia da COVID-19. Para tal, realizou-se um estudo exploratório-quantitativo, utilizando-se informações secundárias obtidas em bases de dados públicas governamentais. A vulnerabilidade socioeconômica dos municípios foi avaliada de forma dinâmica, baseando-se em modelo matemático de previsão do número de casos da COVID-19 aplicado à cidade de Wuhan, na China. Os indicadores de vulnerabilidade foram calculados sob duas trajetórias: valor de produção e número de pessoal ocupado, considerando-se características municipais como densidade demográfica, mobilidade interurbana e índice de desenvolvimento humano (IDH). No caso do estado do Ceará, os achados evidenciaram uma série de determinantes demográficos, sociais e econômicos locais que agravam os impactos da crise. Os indicadores de vulnerabilidade construídos na pesquisa podem servir de base para as decisões de governos municipais e estadual na cronologia da abertura econômica do estado por setores, municípios e regiões.","Câmara, Samuel Façanha; Pinto, Francisco Roberto; Silva, Felipe Roberto da; Gerhard, Felipe",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,427

(Special Issue: Sport and the coronavirus crisis.),2020,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to improve the accuracy of CT for detection of COVID-19-associated pneumonia and to identify patient subgroups who might benefit most from CT imaging. METHODS: A total of 269 patients who underwent CT for suspected COVID-19 were included in this retrospective analysis. COVID-19 was confirmed by reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction. Basic demographics (age and sex) and initial vital parameters (O2-saturation, respiratory rate, and body temperature) were recorded. Generalized mixed models were used to calculate the accuracy of vital parameters for detection of COVID-19 and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of CT. A clinical score based on vital parameters, age, and sex was established to estimate the pretest probability of COVID-19 and used to define low, intermediate, and high risk groups. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The sole use of vital parameters for the prediction of COVID-19 was inferior to CT. After correction for confounders, such as age and sex, CT showed a sensitivity of 0.86, specificity of 0.78, and positive predictive value of 0.36. In the subgroup analysis based on pretest probability, positive predictive value and sensitivity increased to 0.53 and 0.89 in the high-risk group, while specificity was reduced to 0.68. In the low-risk group, sensitivity and positive predictive value decreased to 0.76 and 0.33 with a specificity of 0.83. The negative predictive value remained high (0.94 and 0.97) in both groups.

Data were collected in the latter half of 2020 from 904 nurses across Japan, Republic of Korea, Republic of Turkey, and the United States. The questionnaire included the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 10, plus demographics and 20 questions about practice environment, workplace safety concerning infection control, COVID-related experience, and organizational support. Fear of becoming infected, intention to leave nursing, and having had a positive COVID-19 test were inversely associated with resilience (p < 0.05). Regression analysis indicated that U.S. nurses had significantly greater resilience than nurses in the other countries examined (p < 0.001). Nurses reporting organization support and those who participated in policy and procedure development had higher resilience scores (p < 0.01). Organizational support, involving nurses in policy development, and country of practice were found to be important resilience factors in our research, which aligns with other findings. Further research is recommended to determine the optimal practice environment to support nurse resilience.","Jo, Soojung; Kurt, Sule; Bennett, Jo Anne; Mayer, Kala; Pituch, Keenan A; Simpson, Vicki; Skibiski, Jeanie; Takagi, Etsuko; Karaaslan, Mehtap Metin; Ozluk, Bilgen; Reifsnider, Elizabeth",Nurs. health sci,,427

The study aimed to examine the role of resilience and coping strategies in the secondary stress for the Greek healthcare workers (HCWs) and in the posttraumatic growth following the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece. A sample of 673 HCWs coming from Greece were recruited. A convenience and snowball mixed sampling procedure were used. A questionnaire was distributed through social networking sites, webpages, and personal contacts of the author. Participants were asked to distribute it to their own contacts. Recruitment occurred during April 5 - 30, 2000, amid the lockdown (March 23-May 03), when people were asked to follow the stringent lockdown constraint enforced by the Greek government. Sociodemographic data were collected. The Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale measured secondary traumatic stress (STS) for the HCWs. The Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory, the Brief Resilience Scale, and the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory measured posttraumatic growth, resilience, and coping strategies, respectively. Regression analyses demonstrated that resilience and coping strategies were differentially associated with positive and negative (stress/growth) lockdown outcomes. Resilience and mostly maladaptive coping strategies predicted STS. A mixture of adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies predicted PTG. The so-called ""second wave"" of the outbreak that started in August 2020 indicates that the study of the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown and of the internal resources (resilience and coping) to deal with, is necessary. The findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the coping strategies used by population subgroups (e.g., HCWs) in dealing with the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece.

A considerable variety of viruses ranging from small picornaviruses to large poxviruses are currently being investigated as potential candidates. In the early days of virotherapy, non-engineered wild-type or vaccine-strain viruses were employed. However, these viruses often did not fully satisfy the major criteria of safety and efficacy. Since the advent of reverse genetics systems for manipulating various classes of viruses, the field has shifted to developing genetically engineered viruses with an improved therapeutic index. In this review, we will summarize the concepts and strategies of multi-level genetic engineering of oncolytic measles virus, a prime candidate for cancer immunovirotherapy.

353691,Subsidising Inclusive Insurance to Reduce Poverty,2021-03-10,"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Beijing before May, 2020 resulted from transmission following both domestic and global importation of cases. Here we present genomic surveillance data on 102 imported cases, which account for 17.2% of the total cases in Beijing. Our data suggest that all of the cases in Beijing can be broadly classified into one of three groups: Wuhan exposure, local transmission and overseas imports. We classify all sequenced genomes into seven clusters based on representative high-frequency single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genomic comparisons reveal higher genomic diversity in the imported group compared to both the Wuhan exposure and local transmission groups, indicating continuous genomic evolution during global transmission. The imported group show region-specific SNPs, while the intra-host single nucleotide variations present as random features, and show no significant differences among groups.

354578,Quality improvement at times of crisis,2021,"Social distancing is one of the non-pharmacological measures to contain the infection of COVID-19. At this point in time, no vaccine is available to prevent the infection, no effective drugs are available to prevent and treat the disease, and none of the communities have acquired herd immunity. Various models have shown positive impact of social distancing, provided its implementation on vast majority of the population over a long period of time. Its effect is manifold. Besides flattening the curve, it impacts the political, fiscal, social, economic aspects of the society, along with socially vulnerable and economically underprivileged population. It becomes obsolete after the population develops herd immunity subsequent to widespread infection in the community, or after effective mass immunisation or specific drugs for its control, cure and prevention are available widely.","Mal, Piryani Rano; Suneel, Piryani; Shomeeta, Piryani",J Pak Med Assoc,,427

The current situation has led many countries to implement drastic rules to stop the spread of the virus. According to the Spanish health authority decisions need to be made in the context of uncertainty and lack of knowledgeable experiences through a gradual and asymmetric de-escalation process planned in four phases. Although the vast majority of studies refer to economic risks and impacts on tourist flows and economic income, few of them explicitly investigates safety and health measures that hotel managers should implement to their customers. Over a population of 12,740 hotels, 823 Spanish hotel managers have been involved in a participatory study. With the aim of assessing the actions taken to stop the spread of the virus, empirical research was implemented. A model presented four variables and 13 indicators which have been previously tested among hotel managers in the tourism sector. Five conclusions are drawn from the hypotheses: (1) Mass testing surveillance in customers and employees should be quick, affordable, and homogeneous throughout the European Union. (2) Training measures need to be taken by both public authorities and the private sector to reach a knowledgeable crisis management team with high commitment to the customer's health and safety. (3) Protocols established by public authorities should be observed and adjusted gradually not only in hotels but also in tourist arrivals. (4) Healthy measures need to be periodically updated. (5) Each hotel should set up a surveillance process to guarantee the safety to their customers.","Robina-Ramírez, Rafael; Medina-Merodio, Jose-Amelio; Moreno-Luna, Libertad; Jiménez-Naranjo, Héctor V; Sánchez-Oro, Marcelo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,427

We evaluated incidence and clinical features of GBS in a cohort of patients from two regions of northern Italy with the highest number of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: GBS cases diagnosed in 12 referral hospitals from Lombardy and Veneto in March and April 2020 were retrospectively collected. As a control population, GBS diagnosed in March and April 2019 in the same hospitals were considered. RESULTS: Incidence of GBS in March and April 2020 was 0.202/100 000/month (estimated rate 2.43/100 000/year) vs 0.077/100 000/month (estimated rate 0.93/100 000/year) in the same months of 2019 with a 2.6-fold increase. Estimated incidence of GBS in COVID-19-positive patients was 47.9/100 000 and in the COVID-19-positive hospitalised patients was 236/100 000. COVID-19-positive patients with GBS, when compared with COVID-19-negative subjects, showed lower MRC sum score (26.3±18.3 vs 41.4±14.8, p=0.006), higher frequency of demyelinating subtype (76.6% vs 35.3%, p=0.011), more frequent low blood pressure (50% vs 11.8%, p=0.017) and higher rate of admission to intensive care unit (66.6% vs 17.6%, p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows an increased incidence of GBS during the COVID-19 outbreak in northern Italy, supporting a pathogenic link. COVID-19-associated GBS is predominantly demyelinating and seems to be more severe than non-COVID-19 GBS, although it is likely that in some patients the systemic impairment due to COVID-19 might have contributed to the severity of the whole clinical picture.","Filosto, Massimiliano; Cotti Piccinelli, Stefano; Gazzina, Stefano; Foresti, Camillo; Frigeni, Barbara; Servalli, Maria Cristina; Sessa, Maria; Cosentino, Giuseppe; Marchioni, Enrico; Ravaglia, Sabrina; Briani, Chiara; Castellani, Francesca; Zara, Gabriella; Bianchi, Francesca; Del Carro, Ubaldo; Fazio, Raffaella; Filippi, Massimo; Magni, Eugenio; Natalini, Giuseppe; Palmerini, Francesco; Perotti, Anna Maria; Bellomo, Andrea; Osio, Maurizio; Scopelliti, Giuseppe; Carpo, Marinella; Rasera, Andrea; Squintani, Giovanna; Doneddu, Pietro Emiliano; Bertasi, Valeria; Cotelli, Maria Sofia; Bertolasi, Laura; Fabrizi, Gian Maria; Ferrari, Sergio; Ranieri, Federico; Caprioli, Francesca; Grappa, Elena; Broglio, Laura; De Maria, Giovanni; Leggio, Ugo; Poli, Loris; Rasulo, Frank; Latronico, Nicola; Nobile-Orazio, Eduardo; Padovani, Alessandro; Uncini, Antonino",J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,,427

Boswellia sacra oleoresin (frankincense) was used to treat bacterial infections in traditional Arabian and Asian healing systems for at least 1000 years. Despite this, B. sacra extracts have not been rigorously tested for inhibitory activity against gastrointestinal pathogens or bacterial triggers of autoimmune diseases. Solvent extracts were prepared from Boswellia sacra oleoresins obtained from three regions near Salalah, Oman. MIC values were quantified against gastrointestinal pathogens and bacterial triggers of selected autoimmune diseases by disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. The antibacterial activity was also evaluated in combination with conventional antibiotics, and the class of interaction was determined by ΣFIC analysis. Isobolograms were used to determine the optimal ratios for synergistic combinations. Toxicity was evaluated by ALA and HDF cell viability bioassays. The phytochemical composition of the volatile components of all extracts was identified by nontargeted GC-MS headspace analysis. All methanolic extracts inhibited the growth of all of the bacteria tested, although the extracts prepared using Najdi oleoresin were generally more potent than the Sahli and Houjari extracts. Combinations of the methanolic B. sacra extracts and conventional antibiotics were significantly more effective in inhibiting the growth of several bacterial pathogens. In total, there were 38 synergistic and 166 additive combinations. Approximately half of the synergistic combinations contained tetracycline. All B. sacra extracts were nontoxic in the ALA and HDF cell viability assays. Nonbiased GC-MS headspace analysis of the methanolic extracts putatively identified a high diversity of monoterpenoids, with particularly high abundances of α-pinene. The antibacterial activity and lack of toxicity of the B. sacra extracts indicate their potential in the treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, the extracts potentiated the activity of several conventional antibiotics, indicating that they may contain resistance-modifying compounds.","Rashan, Luay White Alan Haulet Manon Favelin Nicolas Das Parag Cock Ian Edwin",Evidence - Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine,,427
359187,Blockchain-Empowered Multi-Robot Collaboration to Fight COVID-19 and Future Pandemics,2021,"Neuropsychiatric disorders are closely associated with a persistent low-grade inflammatory state. This suggests that the development of psychopathology is not only limited to the brain, but rather involves an additional systemic aspect, accounting for the large body of evidence demonstrating co-presentation of mental illness with chronic inflammatory conditions and metabolic syndromes. Studies have shown that inflammatory processes underlie the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms, with recent studies revealing not only correlative, but causative relationships between the immune system and psychopathology. Lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise may influence psychopathology, and this may occur via a bidirectional relationship. Mental illness may prevent health-seeking behaviours such as failing to maintain a balanced diet, whilst adopting a 'healthy' diet rich in fruits, vegetables and fish alongside nutritional supplementation correlates with a reduction in psychiatric symptoms in patients. Obesity and the gut microbiome have proven to be further factors which play an important role in inflammatory signalling and the development of psychiatric symptoms. In a related paper we focus on the role of exercise (another significant lifestyle factor) on mental health (Venkatesh et al. 2020). Lifestyle modifications which target diet and nutrition may prove therapeutically beneficial for many patients, especially in treatment-resistant subgroups. The current evidence base provides equivocal evidence, however future studies will prove significant, as this is a highly attractive therapeutic avenue, due to its cost efficacy, low side effect profile and preventative potential. By promoting lifestyle changes and addressing the limitations and barriers to adoption, these therapies may prove revolutionary for mental health conditions.","Edirappuli, Shantal D; Venkatesh, Ashwin; Zaman, Rashid",Psychiatr Danub,,427

These include dengue, Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, yellow fever and influenza viruses, cytomegalovirus and coronaviruses. There are currently seven human endemic coronaviruses, all of which cause respiratory diseases and bind to receptors found within the endothelium. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly infectious. Like its predecessor, SARS-CoV, it binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which is expressed in many cell types, particularly in the lung, including endothelial cells. The initiation of a cytokine storm by the virus along with infection of endothelial cells leads to apoptosis and structural and functional changes that attenuate vascular integrity in many organs including the lungs, heart, liver and kidney. Endothelial damage also enhances the coagulation pathway leading to thrombus formation in major vessels and capillaries. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has an adverse outcome for individuals with particular comorbid diseases, e.g. hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It is possible that this is due to the presence of pre-existing endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation in subjects with these diseases. Therapies for COVID-19 that target the endothelium, the inflammatory response and the coagulation pathway are currently under trial.","Mezoh, Genevieve; Crowther, Nigel J",Adv Exp Med Biol,,427

This event has caused disruptions to many aspects of normal life. An important aspect in reducing the impact of the pandemic is to control its spread. Studies have shown that one effective method in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 is to wear masks. Strict mask-wearing policies have been met with not only public sensation but also practical difficulty. We cannot hope to manually check if everyone on a street is wearing a mask properly. Existing technology to help automate mask checking uses deep learning models on real-time surveillance camera footages. The current dominant method to perform real-time mask detection uses Mask-RCNN with ResNet as the backbone. While giving good detection results, this method is computationally intensive and its efficiency in real-time face mask detection is not ideal. Our research proposes a new approach to mask detection by replacing Mask-R-CNN with a more efficient model""YOLO""to increase the processing speed of real-time mask detection and not compromise on accuracy. Besides, given the small volume as well as extreme imbalance of the mask detection datasets, we adopt a latest progress made in few-shot visual classification, simple CNAPs, to improve the classification performance.","Liu, Ren; Ren, Ziang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05402v1.pdf,427

This recommendation involves not only healthcare workers but other category of workers and the general population as well, in public places, especially where social distancing is difficult to maintain. The use of facemasks should not cause physical impairment to individuals, especially for people suffering from lung and heart diseases. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of RPDs on the respiratory function in healthy and asthmatic subjects, in order to identify the fitness for use mainly, but not only for, occupational purposes during COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Ten individuals were included, three of which affected by asthma and three current smokers. A Respiratory Functional Test (RFT) was performed at three times: at the beginning of the work shift 1) without wearing and 2) wearing surgical masks, and 3) after 4 hours of usual working activities wearing the masks. Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) samples were also tested before the first test and the third test. RESULTS: Observed RFTs and ABG parameters did not suffer significant variations, but for Maximal Voluntary Ventilation (P=0.002). Data on asthmatic subjects and smokers were comparable to healthy subjects. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that wearing a surgical mask does not produce significant respiratory impairment in healthy subjects nor in subjects with asthma. Four hours of continuing mask-wearing do not cause a reduction in breathing parameters. Fitness for use in subjects with more severe conditions has to be evaluated individually. Our adapted technique for RFTs could be adopted for the individual RPDs fitness evaluation.","Ciocan, Catalina; Clari, Marco; Fabbro, Donatella; De Piano, Maria Luigia; Garzaro, Giacomo; Godono, Alessandro; Gullino, Attilia; Romano, Canzio",Med Lav,,427

We analyzed the correlation between UCa/Cr in various spot samples and 24hUCa among healthy children. A 24-h urine specimen and three spot urine samples (evening, first, and second morning) were collected in a convenience sample of children aged 6 to 16 years (n = 101). Measured 24hUCa was compared with UCa/Cr in each of the three spot samples. The ability of UCa/Cr to discriminate between children with and without hypercalciuria (calciuria > 4 mg/kg/24 h, 1 mmol/kg/24 h) and optimal timing of the spot sample were determined. Eighty-five children completed an adequate 24-h urine collection. Pearson correlation coefficients between the UCa/Cr on the spot sample and 24hUCa were 0.64, 0.71, and 0.52 for the evening, first, and second morning spot samples, respectively. Areas under the ROC curve were 0.90, 0.82, and 0.75, respectively, for the corresponding spot samples.Conclusion: The relatively strong correlation between 24hUCa and UCa/Cr in evening and first morning spot urine samples suggests that these spots could be preferred in clinical practice.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02900261, date of trial registration 14 September 2016.What is Known:â¢Urinary calcium/creatinine ratio on a single spot urine sample is frequently used as a proxy for 24-h urinary calcium excretion.â¢Correlation of these indicators, including the best timing for spot urine sampling, has not been properly assessed.What is New:â¢Relatively strong correlations were found between the calcium/creatinine ratio on a single spot urine sample and 24-h urinary calcium excretion in healthy children.â¢Evening and first morning spot samples had the highest correlation.","Paccaud, Yan; Rios-Leyvraz, Magali; Bochud, Murielle; Tabin, René; Genin, Bernard; Russo, Michel; Rossier, Michel F; Bovet, Pascal; Chiolero, Arnaud; Parvex, Paloma",Eur. j. pediatr,,427

These universities rely heavily on fee-paying onshore overseas students. Analysing these risk disclosures is essential to understanding the COVID-19 crisis and the implications for organisational change. Design/methodology/approach Document analysis and content analysis of the 2019 annual reports of all Victorian public universities were undertaken to identify the disclosure of COVID-19 risk impacts. Applying Laughlin's Habermasian insights of change, the study explores the pathways of change adopted by universities to overcome the risk impacts. However, financial risk disclosures about income from this source were virtually non-existent. Findings Any risk associated with COVID-19 disclosed was minimal in a qualitative, neutral and constant format. The quality of disclosures was low. Media statements, however, pointed to significant income loss and suggested a strategy of substantial cost-cutting, including employee redundancies, which we identified as morphostatic changes of universities to overcome the risk impacts. Research limitations/implications The study reveals the risk associated with sector's aggressive growth strategy, jeopardising their financial viability and quality of teaching and research. Practical implications The findings provide insights to the Australian higher education sector. The low quality of external risk disclosures of these universities suggests an urgent need for transformation. Originality/value Australian public universities play a crucial role in society. This role will be diminished by a failure to disclose and manage significant risks adequately.","Carnegie, G.

Heightened public stress and anxiety levels, increasing isolation and the physical consequences of addiction play a large role in the proliferation and ongoing relapse of substance misuse and behavioural addiction. Service provision is an ongoing challenge not only due to the increasing need for services given the increased mental health burden of COVID-19 but also the restrictions in place in clinical areas to achieve social distancing. The necessary adaptations to service provision provide opportunities for the analysis of current processes used in our addiction unit and the introduction of new processes to our service. The current crisis tests the sustainability of the service to provide the high standard of care required for these patients.","Columb, D; Hussain, R; O039,; Gara, C",Ir J Psychol Med,,427

364350,New spatialities of work in the city,2021,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed serious threats to global health and economy, thus calling for the development of safe and effective vaccines. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for its binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. It contains multiple dominant neutralizing epitopes and serves as an important antigen for the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Here, we showed that immunization of mice with a candidate subunit vaccine consisting of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and Fc fragment of human IgG, as an immunopotentiator, elicited high titer of RBD-specific antibodies with robust neutralizing activity against both pseudotyped and live SARS-CoV-2 infections. The mouse antisera could also effectively neutralize infection by pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 with several natural mutations in RBD and the IgG extracted from the mouse antisera could also show neutralization against pseudotyped SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). Vaccination of human ACE2 transgenic mice with RBD-Fc could effectively protect mice from the SARS-CoV-2 challenge. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc has good potential to be further developed as an effective and broad-spectrum vaccine to prevent infection of the current SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants, as well as future emerging SARSr-CoVs and re-emerging SARS-CoV.","Liu, Zezhong; Xu, Wei; Xia, Shuai; Gu, Chenjian; Wang, Xinling; Wang, Qian; Zhou, Jie; Wu, Yanling; Cai, Xia; Qu, Di; Ying, Tianlei; Xie, Youhua; Lu, Lu; Yuan, Zhenghong; Jiang, Shibo",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,427

Analyzing the Reconfiguration of Displacement Dynamics in Los Cristianos/Las Américas (Tenerife),2021,"In view of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patient care, including that of psychiatric patients, is facing unprecedented challenges. Treatment strategies for mental illness include psychotherapy and psychopharmacological interventions. The latter are associated with a multitude of adverse drug reactions (ADR); however, they may currently represent the preferred treatment due to restrictions regarding patient care (i.e. social distancing). Direct contact to patients may have to be reduced in favor of telephone calls or video conferences, so that new techniques in diagnosing and treating patients have to be established to guarantee patient safety. Patients should be extensively informed about relevant ADRs and physicians should actively ask patients about the timely recognition of ADRs. The use of psychotropic drugs may lead to an increased risk of developing ADRs, which are considered to be particularly unfavorable if they occur simultaneously with an acute infection or may even lead to an increased risk of infection. These include respiratory depression, agranulocytosis, intoxication by inhibition of metabolizing enzymes and venous thromboembolism, each of which may be associated with potentially fatal consequences; however, physicians should simultaneously ensure adequate efficacy of treatment, since the ongoing crisis may lead to a worsening of preexisting mental illnesses and to a surge in first onset of psychiatric disorders.","Seifert, J; Heck, J; Eckermann, G; Singer, M; Bleich, S; Grohmann, R; Toto, S",Nervenarzt,,427

The infection causes COVID-19, a disease of the respiratory system of divergent severity. Here, the humoral immune response of a cohort of 143 COVID-19 patients from the University Hospital Frankfurt/Main, Germany was characterized. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SARS-CoV-2 and hCoV NL63 neutralization activity was analyzed with pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. RESULTS: COVID-19 severity increased with age and male patients encountered more serious symptoms than females. Disease severity correlated with the amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA and the neutralization activity of the antibodies. The amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies decreased with time after PCR conformation of the infection and antibodies directed against the nucleoprotein waned faster than spike directed antibodies. In contrast, for the common flu coronavirus NL63, COVID19 disease severity seemed to correlate with low NL63-neutralizing activities, suggesting the possibility of cross-reactive protection. CONCLUSION: The results describe the humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and might aid the identification of correlates of protection needed for vaccine development.","Henss, Lisa; Scholz, Tatjana; von Rhein, Christine; Wieters, Imke; Borgans, Frauke; Eberhardt, Fabian J; Zacharowski, Kai; Ciesek, Sandra; Rohde, Gernot; Vehreschild, Maria; Stephan, Christoph; Wolf, Timo; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Scheiblauer, Heinrich; Schnierle, Barbara S",J. infect. dis,,427
365112,Nurses step up to the challenge of working during the pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Epistaxis is frequently managed with intra-nasal packing devices, traditionally requiring patient admission. Current COVID-19 guidelines encourage ambulatory care where possible in this patient cohort. This paper aims to establish the impact of the Clinical Frailty Scale, anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapeutics and season variation on pre-pandemic admissions to help identify patients suitable for ambulatory epistaxis management. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Scottish Regional Health Board PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients attending secondary care with epistaxis between March 2019 and March 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Likelihood of epistaxis hospital admission based on Clinical Frailty Scale. RESULTS: 299 epistaxis presentations were identified, of which 122 (40.8%) required admission. Clinical Frailty Scale of &#8805;4 had an increased likelihood of admission (OR 3.15 (95% CI:1.94-5.16), P < .05). In the majority of presentations (66.2%), patients were taking either an antiplatelet or anticoagulant. Of these presentations, the use of an anticoagulant (OR: 2.00 (95% CI: 1.20-3.33), P < .05 and dual antiplatelet (OR: 2.82 (95% CI: 1.02-7.86), P < .05) demonstrated increased likelihood of admission. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that frailty increases the risk of admission in adult patients presenting with epistaxis. Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) could be utilised in risk stratification to identify suitable patients for outpatient management. Patients with CFS &#8804; 3 could be considered for outpatient management of their epistaxis. It is likely that patients with CFS &#8805;4 on anticoagulant or dual antiplatelet will require admission.","Davies, Timothy; Alatsatianos, Anton; Slim, Mohd Afiq Mohd; Royce, William; Whymark, Andrew",Clin. otolaryngol,,427

Participants in the comparison and TIMB video conditions experienced greater reductions in social distance than the control group. Contrary to our hypothesis, participants in the TIMB video condition did not endorse improved beliefs about recovery and empowerment as compared to the comparison and control groups. These findings provide evidence for TIMB as an effective program for stigma reduction, particularly reducing perceived difference from people with mental illnesses and decreasing desired social distance.","Kosyluk, Kristin; Marshall, Jennifer; Conner, Kyaien; Macias, Diana Rivera; Macias, Sofia; Michelle Beekman, B; Her, Jonathan",Community ment. health j,,427

373264,Being in a good place to die?,2021,"AIMS: Increasing evidence suggests that poor glycemic control in diabetic individuals is associated with poor coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia outcomes and influences chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations. This study aimed to explore the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) and glycemic control on chest CT manifestations, acquired using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based quantitative evaluation system, and COVID-19 disease severity and to investigate the association between CT lesions and clinical outcome. METHODS: A total of 126 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this retrospective study. According to their clinical history of DM and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level, the patients were divided into 3 groups: the non-DM group (Group 1); the well-controlled blood glucose (BG) group, with HbA1c < 7% (Group 2); and the poorly controlled BG group, with HbA1c &#8805; 7% (Group 3). The chest CT images were analyzed with an AI-based quantitative evaluation system. Three main quantitative CT features representing the percentage of total lung lesion volume (PLV), percentage of ground-glass opacity volume (PGV) and percentage of consolidation volume (PCV) in bilateral lung fields were used to evaluate the severity of pneumonia lesions. RESULTS: Patients in Group 3 had the highest percentage of severe or critical illness, with 12 (32%) cases, followed by 6 (11%) and 7 (23%) cases in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.042). The composite endpoints, including death or using mechanical ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), were 3 (5%), 5 (16%) and 10 (26%) in Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively (p = 0.013). The PLV, PGV and PCV in bilateral lung fields were significantly different among the three groups (all p < 0.001): the median PLVs were 12.5% (Group 3), 3.8% (Group 2) and 2.4% (Group 1); the median PGVs were 10.2% (Group 3), 3.6% (Group 2) and 1.9% (Group 1); and the median PCVs were 1.8% (Group 3), 0.3% (Group 2) and 0.1% (Group 1). In the linear regression analyses, which were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and comorbidities, HbA1c remained positively associated with PLV (ß = 0.401, p < 0.001), PGV (ß = 0.364, p = 0.001) and PCV (ß = 0.472, p < 0.001); this relationship was also observed between fasting blood glucose (FBG) and the three CT quantitative parameters. In the logistic regression analyses, PLV [OR 1.067 (1.032, 1.103)], PGV [OR 1.076 (1.034, 1.120)] and PCV [OR 1.280 (1.110, 1.476)] levels were independent predictors of the composite endpoints, as well as the areas under the ROC (AUCs) for PLV [AUC 0.796 (0.691, 0.900)], PGV [AUC 0.783 (0.678, 0.889)] and PCV [AUC 0.816 (0.722, 0.911)]; the ORs were still significant for CT lesions after adjusting for age, sex and poorly controlled diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Increased blood glucose level was correlated with the severity of lung involvement, as evidenced by certain chest CT parameters, and clinical prognosis in diabetic COVID-19 patients. There was a positive correlation between blood glucose level (both HbA1c and FBG) on admission and lung lesions. Moreover, the CT lesion severity by AI quantitative analysis was correlated with clinical outcomes.","Lu, Xiaoting; Cui, Zhenhai; Pan, Feng; Li, Lingli; Li, Lin; Liang, Bo; Yang, Lian; Zheng, Chuansheng",Acta diabetol,,427

The reproductive number (R) is a metric to estimate the transmission of a pathogen during an outbreak. Preliminary published estimates were based on the initial outbreak in China. Whole genome sequences (WGS) analysis found mutational variations in the viral genome; however, previous comparisons failed to show a direct relationship between viral genome diversity, transmission, and the epidemic severity. COVID-19 incidences from different countries were modeled over the epidemic curve. Estimates of the instantaneous R (Wallinga and Teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval were done. WGS were used to determine the populations genomic variation and that underpinned creation of the pathogen genome identity (GENI) score, which was merged with the outbreak curve in four distinct phases. Inference of transmission time was based on a mutation rate of 2 mutations/month. R estimates revealed differences in the transmission and variable infection dynamics between and within outbreak progression for each country examined. Outside China, our R estimates observed propagating dynamics indicating that other countries were poised to move to the takeoff and exponential stages. Population density and local temperatures had no clear relationship to the outbreak progression. Integration of incidence data with the GENI score directly predicted increases in cases as the genome variation increased that led to new variants. Integrating the outbreak curve, dynamic R, and SNP variation found a direct association between increasing cases and transmission genome evolution. By defining the epidemic curve into four stages and integrating the instantaneous country-specific R with the GENI score, we directly connected changes in individual outbreaks based on changes in the virus genome via SNPs. This resulted in the ability to forecast potential increases in cases as well as mutations that may defeat PCR screening and the infection process. By using instantaneous R estimations and WGS, outbreak dynamics were defined to be linked to viral mutations, indicating that WGS, as a surveillance tool, is required to predict shifts in each outbreak that will provide actionable decision making information. Integrating epidemiology with genome sequencing and modeling allows for evidence-based disease outbreak tracking with predictive therapeutically valuable insights in near real time.","Bandoy, D J Darwin R; Weimer, Bart C",Sci Rep,,427

The pandemic-related impacts on the health outcomes of people with dermatological conditions are unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to study the association of COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts with health-related quality of life in patients with skin diseases. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study among Chinese patients with skin diseases. A self-administered web-based questionnaire was distributed through social media. Demographic and clinical data and pandemic-related impacts (isolation status, income changes, and employment status) were collected. The main outcomes included perceived stress (Visual Analog Scale), symptoms of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) and depression (9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire), quality of life (Dermatology Life Quality Index), and health utility mapping based on the EQ-5D-3L descriptive system. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the associations. RESULTS: A total of 506 patients with skin diseases completed the survey. The mean age of the patients was 33.5 years (SD 14.0), and 217/506 patients (42.9%) were male. Among the 506 respondents, 128 (25.3%) were quarantined, 102 (20.2%) reported unemployment, and 317 (62.6%) reported decrease or loss of income since the pandemic. The pandemic-related impacts were significantly associated with impaired mental well-being and quality of life with different effects. Unemployment and complete loss of income were associated with the highest risks of adverse outcomes, with increases of 110% to 162% in the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and impaired quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation, income loss, and unemployment are associated with impaired health-related quality of life in patients with skin diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Guo, Yeye; Shen, Minxue; Zhang, Xu; Xiao, Yi; Zhao, Shuang; Yin, Mingzhu; Bu, Wenbo; Wang, Yan; Chen, Xiang; Su, Juan",J Med Internet Res,,427
377046,Farm Producers' Household Consumption and Individual Risk Behavior after Natural Disasters,2021,"BACKGROUND: Research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on behaviors of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is lacking. AIMS: This study investigates the relationship between COVID-19 and behaviors of children with ASD living in the United States. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Parents and caregivers (nâ¯=â¯200) across the United States, as proxies for children 2-17 years of age with ASD, participated in an online survey querying changes in overall behavior and 15 specific behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of a moderate-to-large impact on the child's overall behavior with household income level and food security status. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: A majority of respondents reported a moderate-to-large impact on the child's overall behavior (74 %) due to COVID-19. Several specific behaviors were also affected. Stratifying by income level and food security status revealed disparities in the impact on overall behavior and most specific behaviors. Compared to a household income &#8805;$100â¯K, an income <$50â¯K was associated with an increased risk of moderate-to-large impact on the child's overall behavior (odds ratio (OR): 4.07, 95 % CI: 1.60, 10.38). Food insecurity also significantly impacted this risk, even after adjusting for potential confounding factors (OR: 3.31, 95 % CI: 1.13, 9.66). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings show a large proportion of caregivers reporting moderate-to-large changes post-COVID-19 in the behaviors of U.S. children with ASD, particularly in families with low income and/or food insecurity. This study highlights the effects of existing disparities on children with ASD and their families during this unprecedented time.","Panjwani, Anita A; Bailey, Regan L; Kelleher, Bridgette L",Res Dev Disabil,,427
377137,Grow Local Manufacturing along US/Mexico Border Region for an Integrated Supply Chain in the Post-COVID-19 Era,2020,"We propose a ""backtracking"" mechanism within Tully's fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) algorithm, whereby whenever one detects consecutive (double) hops during a short period of time, one simply rewinds the dynamics backward in time. In doing so, one reduces the number of hopping events and comes closer to a truly fewest switches surface hopping approach with independent trajectories. With this algorithmic change, we demonstrate that surface hopping can be reasonably accurate for nuclear dynamics in a multidimensional configuration space with a complex-valued (i.e., not real-valued) electronic Hamiltonian; without this adjustment, surface hopping often fails. The added computational cost is marginal. Future research will be needed to assess whether or not this backtracking correction can improve the accuracy of a typical FSSH calculation with a real-valued electronic Hamiltonian (that ignores spin).","Miao, Gaohan; Bian, Xuezhi; Zhou, Zeyu; Subotnik, Joseph",J Chem Phys,,427

Herein, we introduce a new-type of polymersomes featuring reactive oxygen species singlet oxygen (1O2)-labile membrane by employing a versatile stereoregular amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(ß-aminoacrylate)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymers, which are synthesized through a facile one pot modular amino-alkynoate click polymerization between secondary amines and activated alkynes. These polymersomes readily co-encapsulate an anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) and a near infrared (NIR) photosensitizer IR-780 with hydrophobic characteristics in the membrane, and the resulting polymersomes show efficient uptake by the tumor cells. NIR light irradiation on the tumors, following intraperitoneal injection of the IR-780/DOX co-encapsulated polymersomes, facilitates tumor-specific release of DOX through disassembly of the polymersome nanostructure via 1O2-mediated photocleavage of the membrane. Moreover, IR-780 dye can convert NIR light energy into heat in addition to the generation of 1O2, thus allows to realize both photothermal and photodynamic therapy. Accordingly, the NIR light-mediated on demand chemotherapy, in combination with appreciable phototherapy, of IR-780/DOX co-loaded polymersomes demonstrate an efficient tumor suppression in vivo.","Saravanakumar, Gurusamy; Park, Hyeongmok; Kim, Jinhwan; Park, Dongsik; Lim, Junha; Lee, Junseok; Kim, Won Jong",J. control. release,,427

Surveying our center's heart failure (HF) clinic population, we aimed to understand our patients' perception of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and care delivery preferences. Methods: Patients with chronic HF presenting either in-person or virtually were approached to complete a ten question, anonymous, voluntary survey. Acutely decompensated patients and heart transplant recipients were excluded. Results: 109 patients completed the survey. Average age was 62 ± 14 years, 67% were male, and 59% had HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Overall, patients were worried about contracting COVID-19 and believed they were prone to more severe infection given their underlying HF. However, they were not hesitant to initiate healthcare contact for symptoms and preferred in-person appointments over virtual visits. Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, female patients and those with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) were more concerned. Conclusions: Patients with HF are concerned about their increased risk of contracting COVID-19. However, they are actively seeking healthcare contact and prefer in-person over virtual visits.","Fraser, Meg; Mutschler, Melinda; Newman, Christie; Sackman, Kerry; Mehdi, Batul; Wick, Linda; Duval, Sue; Francis, Gary S; Alexy, Tamas",,,427
381605,Information systems in the age of pandemics: COVID-19 and beyond,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Comorbidity of acute ischaemic stroke with Covid-19 is a challenging condition, potentially influencing the decision of whether to administer intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). We aimed to assess the 1-month outcome in ischaemic stroke patients with Covid-19 infection who received IVT alone or before thrombectomy (bridging therapy). METHODS: As a collaboration initiative promoted by the Italian Stroke Organization, all Italian stroke units (n = 190) were contacted and invited to participate in data collection on stroke patients with Covid-19 who received IVT. RESULTS: Seventy-five invited centers agreed to participate. Thirty patients received IVT alone and 17 received bridging therapy between 21 February 2020 and 30 April 2020 in 20 centers (n = 18, Northern Italy; n = 2, Central Italy). At 1 month, 14 (30.4%) patients died and 20 (62.5%) survivors had a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 3 to 5. At 24 to 36 hours, asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) was reported in eight (17.4%) patients and symptomatic ICH (sICH) in two (4.3%) patients. Causes of death were severe ischaemic stroke (n = 8), a new ischaemic stroke (n = 2), acute respiratory failure (n = 1), acute renal failure (n = 1), acute myocardial infarction (n = 1), and endocarditis (n = 1). In survivors with a 1-month mRS score of 3 to 5, baseline glucose level was higher, whereas endovascular procedure time in cases of bridging therapy was longer. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale glucose and creatinine levels were higher in patients who died. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous thrombolysis for patients with stroke and Covid-19 was not a rare event in the most affected areas by pandemic, and rates of 1-month unfavorable outcomes were high compared to previous data from the pre-Covid-19 literature. However, risk of sICH was not increased.","Cappellari, M; Zini, A; Sangalli, D; Cavallini, A; Reggiani, M; Sepe, F N; Rifino, N; Giussani, G; Guidetti, D; Zedde, M; Marcheselli, S; Longoni, M; Beretta, S; Sidoti, V; Papurello, D M; Giossi, A; Nencini, P; Plocco, M; Balestrino, M; Rota, E; Toni, D",Eur. j. neurol,,427

382380,Machine learning using intrinsic genomic signatures for rapid classification of novel pathogens: COVID-19 case study,2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide public health pandemic with a high mortality rate, among severe cases. The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. It is important to ensure early detection of the virus to curb disease progression to severe COVID-19. This study aims to establish a clinical-nomogram model to predict the progression to severe COVID-19 in a timely and efficient manner. Methods: This retrospective study included 202 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and Shiyan Taihe Hospital from January 17 to April 30, 2020. The patients were randomly assigned to the training dataset (n = 163, with 43 progressing to severe COVID-19) or the validation dataset (n = 39, with 10 progressing to severe COVID-19) at a ratio of 8:2. The optimal subset algorithm was applied to filter for the clinical factors most relevant to the disease progression. Based on these factors, the logistic regression model was fit to distinguish severe (including severe and critical cases) from non-severe (including mild and moderate cases) COVID-19. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated using the R software package to evaluate prediction performance. A clinical nomogram was established and performance assessed using the discrimination curve. Results: Risk factors, including demographic data, symptoms, laboratory and image findings, were recorded for the 202 patients. Eight of the 53 variables that were entered into the selection process were selected via the best subset algorithm to establish the predictive model;they included gender, age, BMI, CRP, D-dimer, TP, ALB, and involved-lobe. AUC, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.91, 0.84 and 0.86 for the training dataset, and 0.87, 0.66, and 0.80 for the validation dataset. Conclusion: We established an efficient and reliable clinical nomogram model which showed that gender, age, and initial indexes including BMI, CRP, D-dimer, involved-lobe, TP, and ALB could predict the risk of progression to severe COVID-19.","Tu, C.; Wang, G.; Geng, Y.; Guo, N.; Cui, N.; Liu, J.",Therapeutics &amp; Clinical Risk Management,,427

384610,Preaching in the time of COVID: finding the words to speak of God,2021,"Spermatogenesis is a complex process of sperm generation, including mitosis, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, histones in post-meiotic spermatids are removed from chromatin and replaced by protamines. Although histone-to-protamine exchange is important for sperm nuclear condensation, the underlying regulatory mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we identify PHD finger protein 7 (PHF7) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for histone H3K14 in post-meiotic spermatids. Generation of Phf7-deficient mice and Phf7 C160A knockin mice with impaired E3 ubiquitin ligase activity reveals defects in histone-to-protamine exchange caused by dysregulation of histone removal factor Bromodomain, testis-specific (BRDT) in early condensing spermatids. Surprisingly, E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of PHF7 on histone ubiquitination leads to stabilization of BRDT by attenuating ubiquitination of BRDT. Collectively, our findings identify PHF7 as a critical factor for sperm chromatin condensation and contribute to mechanistic understanding of fundamental phenomenon of histone-to-protamine exchange and potential for drug development for the male reproduction system.","Kim, Chang Rok; Noda, Taichi; Kim, Hyunkyung; Kim, Gibeom; Park, Seongwan; Na, Yongwoo; Oura, Seiya; Shimada, Keisuke; Bang, Injin; Ahn, Jun-Yeong; Kim, Yong Ryoul; Oh, Se Kyu; Choi, Hee-Jung; Kim, Jong-Seo; Jung, Inkyung; Lee, Ho; Okada, Yuki; Ikawa, Masahito; Baek, Sung Hee",Cell Rep,,427
384668,Online Business English Examinations – Challenges and Solutions,2020,"MOTIVATION: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant mammalian mRNA methylation with versatile functions. To date, although a number of bioinformatics tools have been developed for location discovery of m6A modification, functional understanding is still quite limited. As the focus of RNA epigenetics gradually shifts from site discovery to functional studies, there is an urgent need for user-friendly tools to identify and explore the functional relevance of context-specific m6A methylation to gain insights into the epitranscriptome layer of gene expression regulation. RESULTS: We introduced here Funm6AViewer, a novel platform to identify, prioritize, and visualize the functional gene interaction networks mediated by dynamic m6A RNA methylation unveiled from a case control study. By taking the differential RNA methylation (DM) data and differential gene expression (DE) data, both of which can be inferred from the widely used MeRIP-seq data, as the inputs, Funm6AViewer enables a series of analysis, including: (1) examining the distribution of differential m6A sites, (2) prioritizing the genes mediated by dynamic m6A methylation, and (3) characterizing functionally the gene regulatory networks mediated by condition-specific m6A RNA methylation. Funm6AViewer should effectively facilitate the understanding of the epitranscriptome circuitry mediated by this reversible RNA modification.

386597,Analysing Recovery from Pandemics by Learning Theory: The Case of CoVid-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Community pharmacists and their teams have remained accessible to the public providing essential services despite immense pressures during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have successfully expanded the influenza vaccination programme and are now supporting the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out. AIM: This rapid realist review aims to understand how community pharmacy can most effectively deliver essential and advanced services, with a focus on vaccination, during the pandemic and in the future. METHOD: An embryonic programme theory was generated using four diverse and complementary documents along with the expertise of the project team. Academic databases, preprint services and grey literature were searched and screened for documents meeting our inclusion criteria. The data were extracted from 103 documents to develop and refine a programme theory using a realist logic of analysis. Our analysis generated 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations explaining when, why and how community pharmacy can support public health vaccination campaigns, maintain essential services during pandemics and capitalise on opportunities for expanded, sustainable public health service roles. The views of stakeholders including pharmacy users, pharmacists, pharmacy teams and other healthcare professionals were sought throughout to refine the 13 explanatory configurations. RESULTS: The 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations are organised according to decision makers, community pharmacy teams and community pharmacy users as key actors. Review findings include: supporting a clear role for community pharmacies in public health; clarifying pharmacists' legal and professional liabilities; involving pharmacy teams in service specification design; providing suitable guidance, adequate compensation and resources; and leveraging accessible, convenient locations of community pharmacy. DISCUSSION: Community pharmacy has been able to offer key services during the pandemic. Decision makers must endorse, articulate and support a clear public health role for community pharmacy. We provide key recommendations for decision makers to optimise such a role during these unprecedented times and in the future.","Maidment, Ian; Young, Emma; MacPhee, Maura; Booth, Andrew; Zaman, Hadar; Breen, Juanita; Hilton, Andrea; Kelly, Tony; Wong, Geoff",BMJ Open,,427

The most common clinical symptoms were fever (40,6%) and cough (33,3%). When the laboratory findings of patients were examined, the median WBC count was 5.8/mm3 [4.8-8.05/mm3 ], median lymphocyte count was 2.3/mm3 [1.7-3.55/mm3 ], and median C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 2.3/mm3 [1-2.1/mm3 ]. All patients had chest radiographs (CRXs), while only 44.9% of the patients underwent a chest CT. The 8.7% of CXRs and 12.8% of chest CT findings were found as pathological. Ground-glass opacity was the most frequent finding. In the tomography group, the count of lymphocytes was lower, and creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were significantly higher. The patients with pathological tomography findings demonstrated no statistically significant difference in lymphocyte count, and CK and LDH levels; however, their CRP value was significantly higher. CONCLUSION: In this study, it is emphasized that chest CT should be requested by considering the underlying diseases and severity of clinical findings in pediatric patients. In this way, unnecessary chest CT could be prevented in the pediatric population.","Erat, Tugba; Güler, Sükran",Int J Clin Pract,,427

388284,The Inflection Point: Increased Urgency for High Impact Gerontological Nursing Research,2021,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 which causes Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of acute infection relies on RT-PCR based viral detection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the optimal serological testing strategy for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies which provides an important indicator of prior infection and potential short-term immunity. METHODS: The sensitivity and specificity of four different ELISA assays (Euroimmun IgG, Euroimmun NCP-IgG, Fortress and DIAsource) and one CLIA assay (Roche ELECSYS) were evaluated in 423 samples; 137 patients with confirmed RT-PCR COVID-19 infection (true positives), and 100 pre-pandemic samples collected prior to October 2019 (true negatives). A further 186 samples were collected from healthcare staff and analysed by all five assays. RESULTS: The Fortress ELISA assay demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity followed by the Roche ECLIA assay. The highest overall sensitivity came from the assays that measured total antibody (IgM-IgG combined) and the three assays that performed the best (Fortress, Roche, Euroimmun IgG) all have different antigens as their target proteins which suggests that antigen target does not affect assay performance. In mildly symptomatic participants with either a negative RT-PCR or no RT-PCR performed, 16.76% had detectable antibodies suggesting previous infection. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend a combined testing strategy utilising assays with different antigenic targets using the fully automated Roche ECLIA assay and confirming discordant samples with the Fortress Total Antibody ELISA assay. This study provides an important indicator of prior infection in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.","Heffernan, Emma; Kennedy, Lisa; Hannan, Margaret; Ramlaul, Navneet; Denieffe, Stephanie; Courtney, Garry; Watt, Alison; Hurley, John; Lynch, Maureen; Fitzgibbon, Maria C",Ann Clin Biochem,,427

Among these sectors, healthcare providers and medical workers have been impacted prominently due to the massive increase in demand for medical services under unprecedented circumstances. Hence, any tool that can help the compliance with social guidelines for COVID-19 spread prevention will have a positive impact on managing and controlling the virus outbreak and reducing the excessive burden on the healthcare system. This perspective article disseminates the perspectives of the authors regarding the use of novel biosensors and intelligent algorithms embodied in wearable IoMT frameworks for tackling this issue. We discuss how with the use of smart IoMT wearables certain biomarkers can be tracked for detection of COVID-19 in exposed individuals. We enumerate several machine learning algorithms which can be used to process a wide range of collected biomarkers for detecting (a) multiple symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and (b) the dynamical likelihood of contracting the virus through interpersonal interaction. Eventually, we enunciate how a systematic use of smart wearable IoMT devices in various social sectors can intelligently help controlling the spread of COVID-19 in communities as they enter the reopening phase. We explain how this framework can benefit individuals and their medical correspondents by introducing Systems for Symptom Decoding (SSD), and how the use of this technology can be generalized on a societal level for the control of spread by introducing Systems for Spread Tracing (SST).","Mehrdad, S.; Wang, Y.; Atashzar, S.

We found that sera from Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine remain high reactivity toward the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Delta variant while it drops dramatically toward that of Lambda variant. Interestingly, the overall titer of antibodies of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinated individuals drops 3-fold after 6 months, which could be one of major reasons for breakthrough infections, emphasizing the importance of potential third boost shot. While a therapeutic antibody, Bamlanivimab, decreases binding affinity to Delta variant by ~20 fold, it fully lost binding to Lambda variant. Structural modeling of complexes of RBD with human receptor, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), and Bamlanivimab suggest the potential basis of the change of binding.

In detail, a differential equation containing a power-law time dependent growth rate is proposed, whose solution, named Stretched Logistic Function, provides a modified version of the usual logistic function. The model equation is inspired by and applied to the recent spreading on COVID-19 disease in Italy, showing how the real dynamics of infection spreading is characterized by a time dependent dynamics. A speculative discussion of the Stretched Logistic Function in relation to diffusion processes is attempted.","Consolini, Giuseppe; Materassi, Massimo",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,427
390551,How Has COVID-19 Affected Our Orthopedic Implant Industry Partners? Implications for the Surgeon-Industry Relationship in 2020 and Beyond,2020,"At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, designated as SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China and was identified as the causal pathogen of COVID-19. The epidemic scale of COVID-19 has increased dramatically, with confirmed cases increasing across China and globally. Understanding the potential affecting factors involved in COVID-19 transmission will be of great significance in containing the spread of the epidemic. Environmental and meteorological factors might impact the occurrence of COVID-19, as these have been linked to various diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), whose causative pathogens belong to the same virus family as SARS-CoV-2. We collected daily data of COVID-19 confirmed cases, air quality and meteorological variables of 33 locations in China for the outbreak period of 29 January 2020 to 15 February 2020. The association between air quality index (AQI) and confirmed cases was estimated through a Poisson regression model, and the effects of temperature and humidity on the AQI-confirmed cases association were analyzed. The results show that the effect of AQI on confirmed cases associated with an increase in each unit of AQI was statistically significant in several cities. The lag effect of AQI on the confirmed cases was statistically significant on lag day 1 (relative risk (RR) = 1.0009, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0004, 1.0013), day 2 (RR = 1.0007, 95% CI: 1.0003, 1.0012) and day 3 (RR = 1.0008, 95% CI: 1.0003, 1.0012). The AQI effect on the confirmed cases might be stronger in the temperature range of 10 °C &#8804; T < 20 °C than in other temperature ranges, while the RR of COVID-19 transmission associated with AQI was higher in the relative humidity (RH) range of 10% &#8804; RH < 20%. Results may suggest an enhanced impact of AQI on the COVID-19 spread under low RH.","Xu, Hao; Yan, Chonghuai; Fu, Qingyan; Xiao, Kai; Yu, Yamei; Han, Deming; Wang, Wenhua; Cheng, Jinping",Sci Total Environ,,427
391566,"Covid-19: Science, politics, media, and the public—a systemic view",2020,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the putative functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Current literature on the abundance and distribution of ACE2 protein in the human respiratory tract is controversial. We examined the effect of age and lung injury on ACE2 protein expression in rodent and non-human primate (NHP) models. We also examined ACE2 expression in human tissues with and without coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). ACE2 expression was detected at very low levels in preterm, but was absent in full-term and adult NHP lung homogenates. This pattern of ACE2 expression contrasted with that of transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), which was significantly increased in full-term newborn and adult NHP lungs compared to preterm NHP lungs. ACE2 expression was not detected in NHP lungs with cigarette smoke-induced airway disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Murine lungs lacked basal ACE2 immunoreactivity, but responded to hyperoxia, bacterial infection, and allergen exposure with new ACE2 expression in bronchial epithelial cells. In human specimens, robust ACE2 immunoreactivity was detected in ciliated epithelial cells in paranasal sinus specimens, while ACE2 expression was detected only in rare type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in control lungs. In autopsy specimens from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, ACE2 was detected in rare ciliated epithelial and endothelial cells in the trachea, but not in the lung. There was robust expression of ACE2 expression in F344/N rat nasal mucosa and lung specimens, which authentically recapitulated the ACE2 expression pattern in human paranasal sinus specimens. Thus, ACE2 protein expression demonstrates a significant gradient between upper and lower respiratory tract in humans and is scarce in the lung. This pattern of ACE2 expression supports the notion of sinonasal epithelium being the main entry site for SARS-CoV-2 but raises further questions on the pathogenesis and cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 pneumonia.","Soni, Sourabh; Jiang, Yujie; Tesfaigzi, Yohannes; Hornick, Jason L; Çataltepe, Sule",PLoS One,,427
391665,Explaining Caste-based Digital Divide in India,2021-06-30,"MOTIVATION: Human microbes play critical roles in drug development and precision medicine. How to systematically understand the complex interaction mechanism between human microbes and drugs remains a challenge nowadays. Identifying microbe-drug associations can not only provide great insights into understanding the mechanism, but also boost the development of drug discovery and repurposing. Considering the high cost and risk of biological experiments, the computational approach is an alternative choice. However, at present, few computational approaches have been developed to tackle this task. RESULTS: In this work, we leveraged rich biological information to construct a heterogeneous network for drugs and microbes, including a microbe similarity network, a drug similarity network and a microbe-drug interaction network. We then proposed a novel graph convolutional network (GCN)-based framework for predicting human Microbe-Drug Associations, named GCNMDA. In the hidden layer of GCN, we further exploited the Conditional Random Field (CRF), which can ensure that similar nodes (i.e. microbes or drugs) have similar representations. To more accurately aggregate representations of neighborhoods, an attention mechanism was designed in the CRF layer. Moreover, we performed a random walk with restart-based scheme on both drug and microbe similarity networks to learn valuable features for drugs and microbes, respectively. Experimental results on three different datasets showed that our GCNMDA model consistently achieved better performance than seven state-of-the-art methods. Case studies for three microbes including SARS-CoV-2 and two antimicrobial drugs (i.e. Ciprofloxacin and Moxifloxacin) further confirmed the effectiveness of GCNMDA in identifying potential microbe-drug associations.

Targeted measures such as case isolation and contact tracing can alleviate the societal cost of lock-downs by containing the spread where and when it occurs. To assess the relative and combined impact of manual contact tracing (MCT) and digital (app-based) contact tracing, we feed a compartmental model for COVID-19 with high-resolution datasets describing contacts between individuals in several contexts. We show that the benefit (epidemic size reduction) is generically linear in the fraction of contacts recalled during MCT and quadratic in the app adoption, with no threshold effect. The cost (number of quarantines) versus benefit curve has a characteristic parabolic shape, independent of the type of tracing, with a potentially high benefit and low cost if app adoption and MCT efficiency are high enough. Benefits are higher and the cost lower if the epidemic reproductive number is lower, showing the importance of combining tracing with additional mitigation measures. The observed phenomenology is qualitatively robust across datasets and parameters. We moreover obtain analytically similar results on simplified models.","Barrat, A; Cattuto, C; Kivelä, M; Lehmann, S; Saramäki, J",J R Soc Interface,,427

393052,Meaningful life in the time of Corona-economics,2020,"RATIONALE During the COVID-19 pandemic, creating tools to assess disease severity is one of the most important aspects of reducing the burden on emergency departments. Lung ultrasound has a high accuracy for the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases;however, there are few prospective studies demonstrating that lung ultrasound can predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients. We hypothesized that lung ultrasound score (LUS) at hospital admission could predict outcomes of COVID-19 patients. METHODS This is a prospective cohort study conducted from 14 March through 6 May 2020 in the emergency department (ED) of an urban, academic, level I trauma center. Patients aged 18 years and older and admitted to the ED with confirmed COVID-19 were considered eligible. Emergency physicians performed lung ultrasounds and calculated LUS, which was tested for correlation with outcomes. This protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee number 3.990.817 (CAAE: 30417520.0.0000.0068). RESULTS The primary endpoint was death from any cause. The secondary endpoints were ICU admission and endotracheal intubation for respiratory failure. Among 180 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were enrolled (mean age, 60 years;105 male), the average LUS was 18.7 ± 6.8. LUS correlated with findings from chest CT and could predict the estimated extent of parenchymal involvement (mean LUS with &lt; 50% involvement on chest CT, 15±6.7 vs. 21±6.0 with &gt;50% involvement, p&lt;0.001), death (AUC 0.72, OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.21;p &lt; 0.001), endotracheal intubation (AUC 0.76, OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.26;p &lt; 0.001), and ICU admission (AUC: 0.71, OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.21;p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION In this study, LUS was a good predictor of death, ICU admission, and endotracheal intubation in patients with COVID-19 admitted in ED. The study provides support for further research, ideally combining clinical, laboratory, and imaging parameters, to estimate the risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19 infection.","Alencar, J.

We describe five monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cross-reacting with the stem helix of multiple betacoronavirus spike glycoproteins isolated from COVID-19 convalescent individuals. Using structural and functional studies, we show that the mAb with the greatest breadth (S2P6) neutralizes pseudotyped viruses from three different subgenera through the inhibition of membrane fusion, and we delineate the molecular basis for its cross-reactivity. S2P6 reduces viral burden in hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 through viral neutralization and Fc-mediated effector functions. Stem helix antibodies are rare, oftentimes of narrow specificity, and can acquire neutralization breadth through somatic mutations. These data provide a framework for structure-guided design of pan-betacoronavirus vaccines eliciting broad protection.

With the ongoing media coverage and spread of misinformation, public health authorities need to identify effective strategies and create culturally appropriate and evidence-based messaging that best encourage preventive health behaviors to control the spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between COVID-19 sources of information and knowledge, and how US adults' knowledge may be associated with preventive health behaviors to help mitigate COVID-19 cases and deaths. DESIGN AND SETTING: For this cross-sectional study, survey data pertaining to COVID-19 were collected via online platform, Qualtrics, in February and May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Data responses included 718 US adults from the February survey and 672 US adults from the May survey-both representative of the US adult population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 knowledge score, COVID-19 reliable sources of information, and adherence to COVID-19 preventive health behaviors. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The main findings showed that disseminating COVID-19 information across various sources, particularly television, health care providers, and health officials, to increase people's COVID-19 knowledge contributes to greater adherence to infection prevention behaviors. Across February and May 2020 survey data, participants 55 years and older and those with higher educational background reported a higher average COVID-19 knowledge score. In addition, among the racial and ethnic categories, Black/African American and Native American/Alaska Native participants reported a lower average COVID-19 knowledge score than white participants-signaling the need to establish COVID-19 communication that is culturally-tailored and community-based. Overall, health care authorities must deliver clear and concise messaging about the importance of adhering to preventive health behaviors, even as COVID-19 vaccines become widely available to the general public. Health officials must also focus on increasing COVID-19 knowledge and dispelling misinformation.","Shafiq, Mehr; Elharake, Jad A; Malik, Amyn A; McFadden, SarahAnn M; Aguolu, Obianuju Genevieve; Omer, Saad B",J Public Health Manag Pract,,427

395949,Risk management: Are there parallels between COVID19 and floods?,2020,"Chest CT has a potential role in the diagnosis, detection of complications, and prognostication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Implementation of appropriate precautionary safety measures, chest CT protocol optimization, and a standardized reporting system based on the pulmonary findings in this disease will enhance the clinical utility of chest CT. However, chest CT examinations may lead to both false-negative and false-positive results. Furthermore, the added value of chest CT in diagnostic decision making is dependent on several dynamic variables, most notably available resources (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] tests, personal protective equipment, CT scanners, hospital and radiology personnel availability, and isolation room capacity) and the prevalence of both COVID-19 and other diseases with overlapping manifestations at chest CT. Chest CT is valuable to detect both alternative diagnoses and complications of COVID-19 (acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and heart failure), while its role for prognostication requires further investigation. The authors describe imaging and managing care of patients with COVID-19, with topics including (a) chest CT protocol, (b) chest CT findings of COVID-19 and its complications, (c) the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT and its role in diagnostic decision making and prognostication, and (d) reporting and communicating chest CT findings. The authors also review other specific topics, including the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, the World Health Organization case definition, the value of performing RT-PCR tests, and the radiology department and personnel impact related to performing chest CT in COVID-19. ©RSNA, 2020.","Kwee, Thomas C; Kwee, Robert M",Radiographics,,427

Beginning in July, the number of confirmed cases began to increase rapidly, first peaking during July-August, and then declining in September and October (Figure). After 3 months of relatively low case counts, COVID-19 cases began rapidly rising throughout the country in mid-December. On December 18, 2020, South Africa published the genome of a SARS-CoV-2 variant strain with several mutations that affect the spike protein (2). The variant included a mutation (N501Y) associated with increased transmissibility.,§ SARS-CoV-2 lineages with this mutation have rapidly expanded geographically.¶,** The variant strain (PANGO [Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak] lineage B.1.351) was first detected in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa from specimens collected in early August, spread within South Africa, and appears to have displaced the majority of other SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in that country (2). As of January 10, 2021, eight countries had reported cases with the B.1.351 variant. In Zambia, the average number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases increased 16-fold, from 44 cases during December 1-10 to 700 during January 1-10, after detection of the B.1.351 variant in specimens collected during December 16-23. Zambia is a southern African country that shares substantial commerce and tourism linkages with South Africa, which might have contributed to the transmission of the B.1.351 variant between the two countries.","Mwenda, Mulenga; Saasa, Ngonda; Sinyange, Nyambe; Busby, George; Chipimo, Peter J; Hendry, Jason; Kapona, Otridah; Yingst, Samuel; Hines, Jonas Z; Minchella, Peter; Simulundu, Edgar; Changula, Katendi; Nalubamba, King Shimumbo; Sawa, Hirofumi; Kajihara, Masahiro; Yamagishi, Junya; Kapin039,; a, Muzala; Kapata, Nathan; Fwoloshi, Sombo; Zulu, Paul; Mulenga, Lloyd B; Agolory, Simon; Mukonka, Victor; Bridges, Daniel J",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,427

396469,The Impact of Coronavirus on the Current Situation on the Labour Market in Poland,2020,"BACKGROUND: Intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia (IR-AML) without FLT3-ITD, NPM1 and biallelic CEBPA mutations (here referred to as NPM1mut-negCEBPAdm-negFLT3-ITDneg AML) is a clinically heterogeneous disease. The optimal post-remission therapy (PRT) is unclear for patients with NPM1mut-negCEBPAdm-negFLT3-ITDneg AML who achieved first complete response (CR1). This study aims to explore clinical and molecular factors that can help determine the prognosis of those patients and their choice of PRT. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 28 patients with NPM1mut-negCEBPAdm-negFLT3-ITDneg AML who received induction chemotherapy and achieved CR1. For PRT, 17 patients received post-remission chemotherapy (PR-CT) and 11 patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). RESULTS: For patients with NPM1mut-negCEBPAdm-negFLT3-ITDneg AML, multivariate analysis indicated that allo-HSCT and negative minimal residual disease (MRDneg) before PRT were favorable prognostic factors of overall survival (OS) (allo-HSCT, P = 0.002; MRDneg, P = 0.018); whereas relapse was an adverse prognostic factor of OS (P = 0.003). Log-rank analysis showed that allo-HSCT significantly improved their OS and RFS compared with PR-CT (OS, P < 0.001; RFS, P = 001). Otherwise, allo-HSCT improved the OS and RFS of patients with NPM1mut-negCEBPAdm-negFLT3-ITDneg AML, whether they obtained MRDpos or MRDneg before PRT (OS: MRDneg, P = 0.036; MRDpos, P = 0.012; RFS: MRDneg, P = 0.047; MRDpos, P = 0.030). CONCLUSION: For patients with NPM1mut-negCEBPAdm-negFLT3-ITDneg AML, MRDneg before PRT and allo-HSCT were favorable prognostic factors of OS. Whether they obtain MRDneg or not, allo-HSCT is the preferred PRT.","Zheng, Wen-Shuai; Hu, Ya-Lei; Guan, Li-Xun; Peng, Bo; Wang, Shen-Yu",Hematology,,427

We hereby report on a questionnaire-based study performed to assess severity of COVID-19 in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis (n=10), Parkinson's disease (n=5) or cognitive impairment (n=7). In all patients infection with SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by rtPCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. They were receiving treatment with either amantadine (n=15) or memantine (n=7) in stable registered doses. All of them had two-week quarantine since documented exposure and none of them developed clinical manifestations of infectious disease.

Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms, physical signs, and laboratory tests for suspected GCA. Data Sources: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from November 1940 through April 5, 2020. Study Selection: Trials and observational studies describing patients with suspected GCA, using an appropriate reference standard for GCA (temporal artery biopsy, imaging test, or clinical diagnosis), and with available data for at least 1 symptom, physical sign, or laboratory test. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Screening, full text review, quality assessment, and data extraction by 2 investigators. Diagnostic test meta-analysis used a bivariate model. Main Outcome(s) and Measures: Diagnostic accuracy parameters, including positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs). Results: In 68 unique studies (14â¯037 unique patients with suspected GCA; of 7798 patients with sex reported, 5193 were women [66.6%]), findings associated with a diagnosis of GCA included limb claudication (positive LR, 6.01; 95% CI, 1.38-26.16), jaw claudication (positive LR, 4.90; 95% CI, 3.74-6.41), temporal artery thickening (positive LR, 4.70; 95% CI, 2.65-8.33), temporal artery loss of pulse (positive LR, 3.25; 95% CI, 2.49-4.23), platelet count of greater than 400 × 103/µL (positive LR, 3.75; 95% CI, 2.12-6.64), temporal tenderness (positive LR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.14-8.65), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 100 mm/h (positive LR, 3.11; 95% CI, 1.43-6.78). Findings that were associated with absence of GCA included the absence of erythrocyte sedimentation rate of greater than 40 mm/h (negative LR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.08-0.44), absence of C-reactive protein level of 2.5 mg/dL or more (negative LR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.25-0.59), and absence of age over 70 years (negative LR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.27-0.86). Conclusions and Relevance: This study identifies the clinical and laboratory features that are most informative for a diagnosis of GCA, although no single feature was strong enough to confirm or refute the diagnosis if taken alone. Combinations of these symptoms might help direct further investigation, such as vascular imaging, temporal artery biopsy, or seeking evaluation for alternative diagnoses.","van der Geest, Kornelis S M; Sandovici, Maria; Brouwer, Elisabeth; Mackie, Sarah L",JAMA intern. med.

SARS-CoV-2 is highly pathogenic in human, having posed immeasurable public health challenges to the world. Innate immune response is critical for the host defense against viral infection and the dysregulation of the host innate immune responses probably aggravates SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the high morbidity and lethality of COVID-19. It has been reported that some coronavirus proteins play an important role in modulating innate immunity of the host, but few studies have been conducted on SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we screened the viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and found that the viral ORF6, ORF8 and nucleocapsid proteins were potential inhibitors of type I interferon signaling pathway, a key component for antiviral response of host innate immune. All the three proteins showed strong inhibition on type I interferon (IFN-ß) and NF-&#954;B-responsive promoter, further examination revealed that these proteins were able to inhibit the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) after infection with Sendai virus, while only ORF6 and ORF8 proteins were able to inhibit the ISRE after treatment with interferon beta. These findings would be helpful for the further study of the detailed signaling pathway and unveil the key molecular player that may be targeted.","Li, Jin-Yan; Liao, Ce-Heng; Wang, Qiong; Tan, Yong-Jun; Luo, Rui; Qiu, Ye; Ge, Xing-Yi",Virus Res,,427
400988,Lockdown policy effects on invasive species: a perspective,2021,"Scholars such as Carol Johnson and Blair Williams have argued that COVID-19 has led to more favorable coverage of female political leaders than was previously the case. This is attributed to a traditional perception of the motherly role associated with the political response. They laud New Zealand as an exemplary feminist political response in this crisis. Yet Queensland, an Australian state, is also headed by a female politician, with an equivalent population of just over five million, just over 1,300 COVID-19 cases, and only seven deaths. Like Jacinda Ardern, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk won an election in October 2020, in what was perceived as a referendum on her government’s approach to COVID-19 response and recovery. Instead of invoking maternal images, she instead exercised what we term “feminist stewardship” by transferring her legal power over to apolitical medical experts. She was seen to display feminine protectionism by closing internal borders and resisting pressure to re-open borders from male elites who labelled her “heartless.” Even so, her party’s economic recovery package remained resolutely focused on traditional male-dominated areas of mining and construction. This paper extends our understanding of gender and political leadership during COVID-19 by drawing on extensive gender-disaggregated health, economic, and electoral data.","Susan Harris, Rimmer Stephenson Elise Verhelst Tom",The SAIS Review of International Affairs,,427

We show that, in these models, although such a lockdown may delay deaths, it eventually does not avert a significant number of fatalities. Therefore, in these models, the efficacy of a lockdown cannot be gauged by simply comparing figures for the deaths at the end of the lockdown with the projected figure for deaths by the same date without the lockdown. We provide a simple but robust heuristic argument to explain why this conclusion should generalize to more elaborate compartmental models. We qualitatively discuss some conditions, beyond the scope of simple models, under which a lockdown might increase or decrease the epidemic's final toll in the real world. We conclude that SEIR models and their generalizations provide no reliable quantitative evidence that the Indian lockdown has averted any deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Raju, Suvrat",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04219v1.pdf,427

402170,Internal GIG Ecosystem in IT/ITeS Organisations for Non-linear Growth,2021,"BACKGROUND: Smoking is the leading cause of premature death, and low-income adults suffer disproportionate burden from tobacco. Mindfulness interventions show promise for improving smoking cessation. A text messaging program, iQuit Mindfully, was created to deliver just-in-time support for quitting smoking among low-income adults. A pilot study of iQuit Mindfully was conducted in spring 2020, right in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic among low-income and predominantly African American smokers. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study examined the acceptability and feasibility of delivering Mindfulness-Based Addiction Treatment via mHealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were adult cigarette smokers (N=23, 35% [8 of 23] female, 83% African American, 78% [18 of 23] annual income <$24,000). They were randomly assigned to either 8 weeks of iQuit Mindfully as a fully automated standalone intervention or iQuit Mindfully in combination with therapist-led in-person group treatment. For participant safety, in-person mindfulness groups were transitioned online and assessments took place online. Survey questions asked participants about changes in their stress, smoking habits and quit attempts, as well as their perceptions of the mindfulness and text messaging intervention in the context of the pandemic. RESULTS: Most participants (71%, 15 of 21) indicated a change in stress due to the pandemic, with 93% (14 of 15) of those indicating higher stress. Participants shared concerns about finances, homelessness, health and social isolation. Most (81%, 17 of 21) believed that smoking increases risk for contracting COVID-19, and although that was motivating for some, others expressed lower motivation to quit because of higher stress. Most (86%, 18 of 21) said that practicing mindfulness was helpful during the pandemic. Mean ratings of the helpfulness of text messages and the extent they would recommend the program to others were 7.1 (median 8 on 10-point scale, SD=2.9) and 8.2 (median 9, SD=2.5), respectively. Through open-ended program evaluations, participants shared details about how mindfulness practice and the text messages helped them to manage stress and feel a sense of social support during the pandemic. Moreover, 53% (10 of 19) of participants achieved 7-day abstinence from smoking, with no differences between conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the promise of text messaging and use of teleconferencing to provide mindfulness and smoking cessation services to underserved populations during a global pandemic.","Mhende, Josephine; Bell, Sharrill A; Cottrell-Daniels, Cherell; Luong, Jackie; Streiff, Micah; Dannenfelser, Mark; Hayat, Matthew J; Spears, Claire Adams",,,427

402519,Optimisation of non-pharmaceutical measures in COVID-19 growth via neural networks,2020-06-16,"Australia and with that Queensland have been extremely fortunate with the impact of COVID-19. Queensland has only had 1,067 cases as of June 30, 2020, of which 78% have been overseas acquired. Australia and Queensland acted early to address COVID-19 by putting in place a range of strategies including travel bans (international and domestic), isolation measures, testing regimes, advice to business, economic support, and research funding. Agriculture was designated an essential business and as such has continued operating throughout the pandemic. They have however had to develop and implement COVID plans to keep workers safe. To help agricultural business establish plans information was developed by Safe Work Australia, National Farmers Federation and the Queensland Department of Workplace Health and Safety. Workforce issues were identified early, particularly seasonal workers (those who travel from their usual place of residence to another place to work). The Queensland Government enacted a directive about how seasonal workers were to be managed and also developed a guide specifically for horticulture to help manage their COVID-19 response. We provide two case studies demonstrating how agriculture has responded to COVID-19. Agriculture has successfully, in Queensland, adapted quickly to the changing work conditions due to COVID-19. This is due to all levels of government coming together with industry to find solutions. Some changes have had wider benefits such as improved sanitation, better communication and a greater recognition of seasonal worker needs. Being prepared and resilient has enabled agriculture to alleviate the impact on their businesses ensuring the health of all.","Franklin, Richard C; O039,; Sullivan, Fiona",J Agromedicine,,427

The mechanisms through which the virus leads to anosmia/hyposmia is still not fully understood. However, olfaction changes could be used as an indication for testing or quarantine. Screening for infections and other diseases by recognizing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) has been previously conducted. Hence, if the coronavirus infection also results in VOCs excretion, physicians could ""smell"" the virus by using electronic noses. We conducted a literature review on olfaction changes and the COVID-19. Our results suggest that these changes could be used an indication for early testing, even as an isolated symptom. We propose that the electronic nose be used as a future screening tool, especially in agglomeration spaces such as airports, for screening for the COVID-19 infection.","David, Paula; Shoenfeld, Yehuda",Isr Med Assoc J,,427
403327,Influence of Service Levels and COVID-19 on Water Supply Inequalities of Community-Managed Service Providers in Nepal,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The health status of adults with disabilities is recognized as a formal health disparity. Due to COVID-19, participation in wellness programs for this population has been restricted. To provide program participants with continued accessibility, one regional wellness program for adults with disabilities adopted a virtual format. The purpose of this research is to determine the effectiveness of a virtual wellness program for this population. METHODS: Study subjects consisted of adults with disabilities who participated in a regional virtual wellness program. A survey was developed and disseminated electronically to study participants through Qualtrics software. Part 1 of the survey included demographic information, while Part 2 surveyed participants' perceptions and satisfaction with the virtual program using a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS: 10 out of 14 participants responded to the survey. Results indicated that the majority (80%) of participants utilized the program at least 1-2 times/week. All participants reported that, despite preferring in-person wellness classes, they were satisfied with the virtual format of the program. Positive responses were also reported for survey items related to self-perceived health and functional benefits from participation, degree of staff and peer support offered through virtual means, ease of technology use, and the degree of safety within the virtual environment. DISCUSSION: Given the health status of adults with disabilities during an ongoing global pandemic, continued restrictions limiting participation with in-person wellness programs is anticipated. Virtual formats may offer an advantageous solution to provide adults with disabilities with continued access to this essential programming. While the current study showed positive self-perceived health and functional benefits from participation, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of this format through expanded and standardized objective outcome measures and to better understand factors that may impact participation.","Roca, C.",J Allied Health,,427

405078,Introduction: sport and COVID-19: impacts and challenges for the future (Volume 1),2021,"PURPOSE: In some countries, telephone-based support is one of the key services used for supporting patients with cancer. However, there is a lack of research on the efficacy of this method in Iran. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of tele-nursing on supportive care needs (SCNs) of patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 60 patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy who were randomly assigned and allocated to two groups, an intervention group and a control group. Patients' SCNs were assessed in the baseline, and 1 and 2 months after commencement of the intervention using the SCNs Survey -Short Form 34. The data were analyzed through descriptive statistics, t-test, and repeated measure test, by SPSS version 16. RESULTS: There were no significant statistical differences in the mean score of dimensions and total SCNs between the two groups in baseline (pË0.05). However, the results showed that the mean score of dimensions and total SCNs in the intervention group were significantly less than the control group, after the intervention (pË0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Telephone-based support is an effective method to address and reduce SCNs of patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy through increasing access to support for this population especially who may be in rural and remote settings. During the COVID_19 pandemic and given the vulnerability of patients with cancer, telephone support can be used to avoid unnecessary visits to hospitals and reduced the risk of transmitting the virus to the patients.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of a pediatric kidney transplant population at a New York transplant center. Baseline characteristics and clinical course of patients with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (Ab or PCR) were described, and comparison between COVID-positive and COVID-negative transplant patients was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients had COVID-19 IgG testing performed, eight of whom also had PCR testing. 23% of our cohort had evidence of COVID-19 infection. Four patients had positive IgG only, and one patient had a positive PCR. All five patients with a positive COVID test were female. Two patients had COVID-19 symptoms, which were mild. Of the symptomatic patients, one had a positive PCR at time of symptoms, while the other had a negative PCR during symptoms but subsequently had positive IgG. As compared to patients with COVID-19 negative results, those with COVID-19 positivity were significantly more likely to have a known COVID-19 exposure, and were also more likely to be female. There was no significant difference in time from transplant between the groups. Those in the COVID-positive group had higher baseline antimetabolite dose and CNI troughs, although these did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric kidney transplant recipients are at risk for development of COVID-19 infection. While this population may be more at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their immunosuppressed status, their clinical course appears mild and similar to a healthy pediatric population.","Singer, Pamela S; Sethna, Christine; Molmenti, Ernesto; Fahmy, Ahmed; Grodstein, Elliot; Castellanos-Reyes, Laura; Fassano, Jessica; Teperman, Lewis",Pediatr Transplant,,427

Healthcare professionals are tasked with the challenge of managing diverse multisystem clinical manifestations of this infection. Although acute hypoxic respiratory failure is the hallmark of severe COVID-19 disease, there have been diverse manifestations within the cardiovascular (CV) system that each pose unique therapeutic challenges. Of these manifestations, myocardial injury and right ventricular dysfunction are the most common, however, heart failure, circulatory shock, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, and vascular thrombosis have been noted as well. Furthermore, these CV related manifestations portend greater morbidity and mortality, which requires clinicians to be familiar with the most recent information to provide informed patient care. Although there are limited treatment options available for COVID-19, it is imperative that the potential cardiovascular implications of these therapies are considered in these patients. This review highlights the pathophysiological mechanisms of and therapeutics for CV manifestations of COVID-19 as well as the CV implications of proposed COVID-19 therapies.

We collected data from 183 employees with 3 daily measurement occasions over 2 consecutive workweeks. We analyzed the data using multilevel path modeling with latent variance decomposition into within- and between-person variance parts. Results showed that psychological detachment predicted a decrease in hindrance and threat appraisal but no change in challenge appraisal from afternoon to morning. State of being recovered mediated the relationship between psychological detachment and threat appraisal but not hindrance appraisal. Psychological detachment was indirectly related to an increase in challenge appraisal via state of being recovered in the morning.

METHODS: A survey of 788 U.S. adults was conducted to explore the relationships between demographics and psychosocial predictors of intent to get a future COVID-19 vaccine as well as willingness to get such a vaccine under EUA. RESULTS: Significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake intentions were education, having insurance, scoring high on subjective norms, a positive attitude toward the vaccine, as well as high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, high perceived benefits of the vaccine, scoring low on barriers to the vaccine, and scoring high on self-efficacy. Predictors of willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine under EUA were age, race/ethnicity, positive subjective norms, high perceived behavioral control, positive attitudes toward the vaccine, as well as high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, high perceived benefits of the vaccine, low barriers to the vaccine, and scoring high on self-efficacy for getting the vaccine. Concerns about rushed vaccine development appear to reduce vaccine uptake intent, as well as willingness to get the vaccine under EUA. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine-related messages should both address concerns about the vaccine and its development and reinforce benefits of the vaccine (both factors significant in both models).

412065,Reduction of Low-Frequency Vessel Noise in Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"We study the escape fraction of ionizing photons (f_esc) in two cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxies in the reionization era with halo mass M_halo~10^10 and 10^11 M_sun (stellar mass M*~10^7 and 10^9 M_sun) at z=5 from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project. These simulations explicitly resolve the formation of proto-globular clusters (GCs) self-consistently, where 17-39% of stars form in bound clusters during starbursts. Using post-processing Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations of ionizing radiation, we compute f_esc from cluster stars and non-cluster stars formed during a starburst over ~100 Myr in each galaxy. We find that the averaged f_esc over the lifetime of a star particle follows a similar distribution for cluster stars and non-cluster stars. Clusters tend to have low f_esc in the first few Myrs, presumably because they form preferentially in more extreme environments with high optical depths; the f_esc increases later as feedback starts to disrupt the natal cloud. On the other hand, non-cluster stars formed between cluster complexes or in the compressed shell at the front of a superbubble can also have high f_esc. We find that cluster stars on average have comparable f_esc to non-cluster stars. This result is robust across several star formation models in our simulations. Our results suggest that the fraction of ionizing photons from proto-GCs to cosmic reionization is comparable to the cluster formation efficiency in high-redshift galaxies and hence proto-GCs likely contribute an appreciable fraction of photons but are not the dominant sources for reionization.","Ma, Xiangcheng; Quataert, Eliot; Wetzel, Andrew; Faucher-Giguere, Claude-Andr'e; Boylan-Kolchin, Michael",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10065v1.pdf,427

413853,Introduction to the COVID-19 Series,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of total splenectomy and proximal gastric vagotomy (PGV) isolated or associated to the vascularization of the stomach. METHODS: Twenty-eight dogs were distributed in: group A - animals undergoing laparotomy and gastric manipulation; group B - animals undergoing PGV; group C - animals undergoing PGV and splenectomy; and group D - animals undergoing splenectomy alone. All animals were sacrificed on the 7th postoperative day, and immediately followed by infusion of xanthene dye into the thoracic aorta. On the gastric mucous surface, the formation of stained areas and other areas lacking staining was measured by millimeter squares, planimetry and the computerized morphometry method. RESULTS: The formation of an area lacking in staining along the lesser gastric curvature was seen in all animals of groups B and C, which was significantly increased in group C, although in groups A and D such areas were not observed. CONCLUSION: These results showed that, in animals with splenectomy, the vascularization of the stomach was capable of perfusing the whole organ surface, but in animals with PGV alone or associated with splenectomy there was a notable decrease in blood supply throughout the area of the lesser gastric curvature, which suggests the ischemic impairment of this region.","Augusto Real Martinez, Carlos; Waisberg, Jaques; Tadeu Palma, Rogério; Zangiácomo da Silva, Fabiana; Cimerman, Gustavo; Schmidt Goffi, Fabio",Acta cir. bras.,,427

414175,"Unrealistic Optimism in the Time of Coronavirus Pandemic: May It Help to Kill, If So-Whom: Disease or the Person?",2020,"Background: Surgical specialties face unique challenges caused by SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19). These disruptions will call on clinicians to have greater consideration for non-operative treatment options to help manage patient symptoms and provide therapeutic care in lieu of the traditional surgical management course of action. This study aimed to summarize the current guidance on elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, assess how this guidance may impact orthopaedic care, and review any recommendations for non-operative management in light of elective surgery disruptions. Methods: A systematic search was conducted, and included guidance were categorized as either “Selective Postponement” or “Complete Postponement” of elective surgery. Selective postponement was considered as guidance that suggested elective cases should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, whereas complete postponement suggested that all elective procedures be postponed until after the pandemic, with no case-by-case consideration. In addition, any statements regarding conservative/non-operative management were summarized when provided by included reports. Results: A total of 11 reports from nine different health organizations were included in this review. There were seven (63.6%) guidance reports that suggested a complete postponement of non-elective surgical procedures, whereas four (36.4%) reports suggested the use of selective postponement of these procedures. The guidance trends shifted from selective to complete elective surgery postponement occurred throughout the month of March. The general guidance provided by these reports was to have an increased consideration for non-operative treatment options whenever possible and safe. As elective surgery begins to re-open, non-operative management will play a key role in managing the surgical backlog caused by the elective surgery shutdown. Conclusion: Global guidance from major medical associations are in agreement that elective surgical procedures require postponement in order to minimize the risk of COVID-19 spread, as well as increase available hospital resources for managing the influx of COVID-19 patients. It is imperative that clinicians and patients consider non-operative, conservative treatment options in order to manage conditions and symptoms until surgical management options become available again, and to manage the increased surgical waitlists caused by the elective surgery shutdowns.","Phillips, Mark R.; Chang, Yaping; Zura, Robert D.; Mehta, Samir; Giannoudis, Peter V.; Nolte, Peter A.; Bhandari, Mohit",Ther.

414511,Reflection: (Not) feeding the bereaved in the time of coronavirus,2021,"Previous research in the social sciences has shown that haptic interaction rituals are critical for maintaining social relationships. However, during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, ‘social distancing’ was encouraged in order to avoid the spread of disease. Drawing on data from self-ethnography as well as publicly available resources, in this study we explore some new, locally negotiated haptic trajectories to accomplish interaction rituals in the time of coronavirus. First, we present self-ethnographic observations of distancing in face-to-face encounters from our everyday lives. Second, utilizing methods of microanalysis of naturally occurring interaction, we investigate video recordings of the embodied negotiation of space and touch among politicians. We analyze three different ways in which politicians negotiate transitional moves in this haptic ritual when one party initiates a handshake: repairing, declining and apologizing. Our analysis shows that politicians adapt their entire bodies in conjunction with talk, gestures and laughter not only to accomplish the greeting but also to remedy the potentially face-threatening situation of not getting the greeting right. This research has implications for better understanding the spontaneous ability of human beings to invent new ways of engaging with each other. Moreover, it adds to our knowledge of how the materiality of human bodies can impact forms of sociality.","Katila, Julia; Gan, Yumei; Goodwin, Marjorie H",Discourse Stud.,,427

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 16416 people covering three risk groups was done between 3-16 September 2020 using the state of Karnataka's infrastructure of 290 healthcare facilities across all 30 districts. Participants were further classified into risk subgroups and were sampled using stratified sampling. All participants were subjected to simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using a commercial ELISA kit, SARS-CoV-2 antigen using a rapid antigen detection test (RAT), and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for RNA detection. Maximum-likelihood estimation was used for joint estimation of the adjusted IgG, active, and total prevalence (either IgG or active or both), while multinomial regression identified predictors. RESULTS: Overall adjusted total prevalence of COVID-19 in Karnataka was 27.7% (95% CI: 26.1 to 29.3), IgG 16.8% (15.5 to 18.1) and active infection fraction 12.6% (11.5 to 13.8). Case-to-infection ratio 1:40, and infection fatality rate 0.05%. Influenza-like-symptoms or contact with COVID-19 positive patient are good predictors of active infection. RAT kits had higher sensitivity (68%) in symptomatics compared to 47% asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Our sentinel-based population survey is the first comprehensive survey to provide accurate estimates of the COVID-19 burden. Our findings provide a reasonable approximation of the population immunity threshold levels. Leveraging existing surveillance platforms, coupled with syndromic approach and sampling framework, renders our model replicable.","Babu, Giridhara R; Sundaresan, Rajesh; Athreya, Siva; Akhtar, Jawaid; Pandey, Pankaj Kumar; Maroor, Parimala S; Padma, M Rajagopal; Lalitha, R; Krishnappa, Lalitha; Shariff, Mohammed; Manjunath, C N; Sudarshan, Mysore Kalappa; Gururaj, Gopalkrishna; Ranganath, Timmanahalli Sobagaiah; Vasanth, Kumar DE; Banandur, Pradeep; Ravi, Deepa; Shiju, Shilpa; Lobo, Eunice; Satapathy, Asish; Alahari, Lokesh; Dinesh, Prameela; Thakar, Vinitha; Desai, Anita; Rangaiah, Ambica; Munivenkatappa, Ashok; S, Krishna; Basawarajappa, Shantala Gowdara; Sreedhara, H G; Kc, Siddesh; B, Amrutha Kumari; Umar, Nawaz; Ba, Mythri; Vasanthapuram, Ravi",Int. j. infect. dis,,427

It is unclear whether this applies to patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In this case series, 74 patients from a single institution with genitourinary (GU) cancer on ICI were followed up during a 12-wk period. During this period, 11 patients (15%) developed symptoms consistent with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and four (5%) tested positive. Two patients had metastatic urothelial cancer (treated with atezolizumab) and two had metastatic renal cancer (treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab). All had additional risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality and two received steroids within 1 mo of infection. Two patients developed symptoms requiring hospitalisation. All four are alive 32-45 d after their first symptoms and 28-38 d after testing positive. These patients all had multiple risk factors associated with severe COVID-19. These data suggest that the higher risk of COVID-19 death associated with systemic therapy in cancer may not apply to patients on ICIs. Assessment of COVID-19 severity in these patients can be complicated by the underlying cancer and its treatment.","Szabados, Bernadett; Abu-Ghanem, Yasmin; Grant, Michael; Choy, Julia; Bex, Axel; Powles, Thomas",Eur. urol,,427

One of these strains is the B.1.1.7 variant that has initially been described in the United Kingdom and has subsequently spread to several countries. Monitoring the amplification of the S gene-a major hotspot for molecular evolution-by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) allows rapidly screening for such variants. This report describes the detection of sequence variants in Romania by using this strategy followed by next-generation sequencing of the entire genome for confirmation and further characterization. One B.1.1.7 and three B.1.258 sequences were confirmed. Each of these strains presented additional mutations with possible impact on the replicative capacity.

416318,Scenario analysis of non-pharmaceutical interventions on global COVID-19 transmissions,2020-04-07,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was previously known as 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The disease evolved into a serious global emergency, leading to its declaration as a pandemic. DISCUSSION: On the African continent, Nigeria is just experiencing the direct effects of this pandemic, having recorded her index case in February 2020, with an increasing number of cases every day and a current case fatality ratio of 0.03 as at 13 April 2020. Although the recorded cases may seem low, it has been forecast that Africa will have some of the worst effects of this disease by the end of the pandemic. Generally, African countries have fragile health systems and this remains a source of concern, especially in the event of increased outbreaks. Nigeria's current national health systems cannot effectively respond to the growing needs of already infected patients requiring admission into intensive care units for acute respiratory diseases and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS COV-2) pneumonia. This has grim implications for Nigeria, especially as increased cases loom that may require critical care. Provision of quarantine or isolation facilities and availability of rapid diagnostic kits for fast and reliable testing and diagnosis of the disease can also be a challenge in Africa. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need to put into perspective these realities peculiar to Africa including Nigeria and explore available collective measures and interventions to address the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ohia, Chinenyenwa; Bakarey, Adeleye S; Ahmad, Tauseef",Int J Infect Dis,,427

METHODS: In this nationwide retrospective observational study, patients in Tunisia diagnosed with COVID-19 between the 2nd of March and the 16th of May 2020 were contacted by telephone. We collected demographic and clinical data and specified characteristics and evolution of main neurological symptoms. RESULTS: Of 1034 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 646 were included (mean age 42.17 years old) and 466 (72.1%) had neurological symptoms. Neurological symptoms were isolated 22.7% (n = 106). Headache was the most frequent neurological symptom (n = 279, 41.1%): mainly frontotemporal (n = 143, 51.1%) and mild or moderate (n = 165, 59.1%). When associated with fever (n = 143, 51.3%), headache was more likely to be severe and present at onset. Recovery was reported in 83.2%. Smell and taste impairment were found in 37.9% (n = 245) and 36.8% (n = 238) respectively. Among them, 65.3% (156/239) were anosmic and 63.2% (146/231) were ageusic. A complete improvement was found in 72.1% (174/240) of smell impairment and in 76.8% (179/233) of taste impairment. Myalgia (n = 241, 37.3%) and sleep disturbances (n = 241, 37.3%) were also frequent. Imported cases had more neurological symptoms (p = 0.001). In 14.5%, neurological symptoms preceded the respiratory signs (RS). RS were associated with more frequent (p = 0.006) and numerous (p < 0.001) neurological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological symptoms in COVID-19 are frequent, can be isolated and present at onset. A total recovery is the most recorded outcome. RS are predictive of neurological symptoms.

Objetivo: Reflejar la relevancia potencial de la tecnología de ARN de interferencia (ARNi), como alternativa terapéutica contra la COVID-19. Material y métodos: Se consultaron las bases de datos especializadas en busca de artículos publicados hasta abril de 2020. Se emplearon descriptores específicos y operadores booleanos. Se empleó la estrategia de búsqueda avanzada para la selección de los artículos, teniendo en cuenta la calidad metodológica o validez de los estudios. Desarrollo: Fueron identificadas evidencias de aplicación a nivel experimental de la tecnología de ARNi contra el SARS-CoV. Se han diseñado y evaluado varios ARNs pequeños interferentes y ARNs pequeños con estructura en lazo, orientados al silenciamiento de genes esenciales del SARS-CoV, incluyendo aquellos que codifican las proteínas S, RdRp, M, E, N, 3a/3b y 7a/7b. Se comprobó la efectividad de los ARNi en el silenciamiento de sus genes diana. Aunque la mayoría de estas investigaciones se han realizado en sistemas in vitro, también se ha comprobado la utilidad terapéutica de la administración intranasal de ARNi en un modelo de SARS-CoV in vivo. Conclusiones: La tecnología de ARNi ha mostrado potencialidades como estrategia terapéutica contra el SARS-CoV en modelos celulares y animales. Dadas las similitudes a nivel genómico y en cuanto al proceso patogénico entre SARS-CoV y SARS-CoV-2, esta tecnología es potencialmente aplicable el tratamiento de la COVID-19.","Cuello Almarales, Dany A.; Almaguer Mederos, Luis E.; Almaguer Gotay, Dennis",Rev. habanera cienc. méd,,427

Therefore we aimed to explore the severity and atypical manifestations of COVID-19 among children. METHODS: This is an observational cohort study conducted on 398 children with confirmed COVID-19 by using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for detection of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid during the period from March to November 2020. Patients were subdivided regarding the severity of COVID-19 presentation into Group I (Non-severe COVID-19) was admitted into wards and Group II (Severe COVID-19) admitted into the PICU. RESULTS: Non- severe cases were 295cases (74.1%) and 103cases (25.9%) of severe cases. There was a significant difference between age groups of the affected children (P < 0.001) with a median (0-15 years). Boys (52%) are more affected than girls (48%) with significant differences (P < 0.001). 68.6%of confirmed cases had contact history to family members infected with COVID-19. 41.7% of severe patients needed mechanical ventilation. Death of 20.4% of severe cases. In COVID-19 patients, fever, headache, fatigue and shock were the most prominent presentations (95, 60.3, 57.8, and 21.8% respectively). 3.5% of children were manifested with atypical presentations; 1.25% manifested by pictures of acute pancreatitis, 1.25% presented by manifestations of deep venous thrombosis and 1.0% had multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Multivariate regression analysis showed that COVID-19 severity in children was significantly higher among children with higher levels of D-dimer, hypoxia, shock and mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Most children had a non-severe type of COVID-19 and children with severe type had higher levels of D-dimer, hypoxia, shock and mechanical ventilation.","Saleh, Nagwan Y; Aboelghar, Hesham M; Salem, Sherif S; Ibrahem, Reda A; Khalil, Fatma O; Abdelgawad, Ahmed S; Mahmoud, Asmaa A",BMC Pediatr,,427

420335,Covid-19: UK government is urged to publish daily care home deaths as it promises more testing,2020,"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was isolated from the respiratory epithelium of patients with unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan, China. This pathogen, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes a pathogenic condition that has been termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has reached pandemic proportions. As of 17 September 2020, more than 30 million confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in 204 different countries, claiming more than 1 million lives worldwide. Accumulating evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a variety of clinical conditions, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening cases. In the early stages of the disease, most patients experience mild clinical symptoms, including a high fever and dry cough. However, 20% of patients rapidly progress to severe illness characterized by atypical interstitial bilateral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction. Almost 10% of these critically ill patients subsequently die. Insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 progression are emerging and highlight the critical role of the immunological hyper-response - characterized by widespread endothelial damage, complement-induced blood clotting and systemic microangiopathy - in disease exacerbation. These insights may aid the identification of new or existing therapeutic interventions to limit the progression of early disease and treat severe cases.","Perico, Luca; Benigni, Ariela; Casiraghi, Federica; Ng, Lisa F P; Renia, Laurent; Remuzzi, Giuseppe",Nat Rev Nephrol,,427

These economical compounds have been used as antimalarial agents for many years. Currently, they are used as monotherapy or in conjunction with other therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjögren's syndrome (SS) and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). Based on its effects on the modulation of the autophagy process, various clinical studies suggest that CQ and HCQ could be used in combination with other chemotherapeutics for the treatment of various types of cancer. Furthermore, the antiviral effects showed against Zika, Chikungunya, and HIV are due to the annulation of endosomal/lysosomal acidification. Recently, CQ and HCQ were approved for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of infected patients with the coronavirus SARSCoV- 2, causing the disease originated in December 2019, namely COVID-2019. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pharmacological effects of these drugs: 1) disruption of lysosomal and endosomal pH, 2) inhibition of protein secretion/expression, 3) inhibition of antigen presentation, 4) decrease of proinflammatory cytokines, 5) inhibition of autophagy, 6) induction of apoptosis and 7) inhibition of ion channels activation. Thus, evidence has shown that these structures are leading molecules that can be modified or combined with other therapeutic agents. In this review, we will discuss the most recent findings in the mechanisms of action of CQ and HCQ in the immune system, and the use of these antimalarial drugs on diseases.","Martinez, Gricelis P; Zabaleta, Mercedes E; Di Giulio, Camilo; Charris, Jaime E; Mijares, Michael R",Curr Pharm Des,,427

Design: Retrospective cohort. Setting: Two emergency departments in Detroit, Michigan, United States, during a local coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak (March 2020 to April 2020). Patients: Emergency department patients receiving lung ultrasound for clinical suspicion of coronavirus disease 2019 during the study period. Interventions: None, observational analysis only. Measurements and Main Results: By a reference standard of serial reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions, 42 patients were coronavirus disease 2019 positive, 16 negative, and eight untested (test results lost, died prior to testing, and/or did not meet hospital guidelines for rationing of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests). Thirty-three percent, 44%, 38%, and 17% had mortality, ICU admission, intubation, and venous or arterial thromboembolism, respectively. Receiver operating characteristics, area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity with 95% CIs were calculated for five lung ultrasound patterns coded by a blinded reviewer and chest radiograph. Chest radiograph had area under the curve = 0.66 (95% CI, 0.54-0.79), 74% sensitivity (95% CI, 48-93%), and 53% specificity (95% CI, 32-75%). Two lung ultrasound patterns had a statistically significant area under the curve: symmetric bilateral pulmonary edema (area under the curve, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.50-0.64), and a nondependent bilateral pulmonary edema pattern (edema in superior lung &#8805; inferior lung and no pleural effusion; area under the curve, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.68-0.90). Chest radiograph plus the nondependent bilateral pulmonary edema pattern showed a statistically improved area under the curve (0.80; 95% CI, 0.68-0.90) compared to either alone, but at the ideal cutoff had sensitivity and specificity equivalent to nondependent bilateral pulmonary edema only (69% and 77%, respectively). The strongest combination of clinical, chest radiograph, and lung ultrasound factors for diagnosis was nondependent bilateral pulmonary edema pattern with temperature and oxygen saturation (area under the curve, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.94; sensitivity = 77% [58-93%]; specificity = 76% [53-94%] at the ideal cutoff), which was superior to chest radiograph alone. Conclusions: Lung ultrasound diagnosed severe presentations of coronavirus disease 2019 with similar sensitivity to chest radiograph, CT, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (on first testing) and improved specificity compared to chest radiograph. Diagnostically useful lung ultrasound patterns differed from those hypothesized by previous, nonanalytical, reports (case series and expert opinion), and should be evaluated in a rigorous prospective study.","Favot, Mark; Malik, Adrienne; Rowland, Jonathan; Haber, Brian; Ehrman, Robert; Harrison, Nicholas",Crit Care Explor,,427

The podcast was initially used to highlight the scholarship and humanity of fellow human biologists through interviews about ""how the sausage is made"" in research-that is, the nuts and bolts that go into our publications. However, we soon realized there is much more a weekly podcast can do to help colleagues in our interrelated fields. METHODS: Here we introduce the different contributions to this #Hackdemics special issue. Through #Hackademics, we address under-discussed topics in academia such as work-life integration, hostile academic environments, decolonization of research and teaching, and science communication, among others. RESULTS: The feedback received from listeners for the #Hackademics series reinforced a need for more tools for navigating the academic side of our disciplines. Furthermore, there was a need to decentralize what is often termed ""institutional knowledge"" by sharing it in a more authoritative medium-a special issue of peer-reviewed articles in our Association's esteemed journal. This special issue's contributions also elevate diverse voices with multiple authors at different career stages. CONCLUSIONS: Using the institutional credibility of peer-review to legitimize these topics, this issue's articles can be a resource for those looking to initiate conversations or change within their departments or institutions with the hope of creating a kinder, more respectful, collaborative, equitable, and accessible academic environment.","Ocobock, Cara; Owens, Caroline; Holdsworth, Elizabeth; Gildner, Theresa; Lynn, Christopher",Am J Hum Biol,,427

Abundant scientific evidence the wild animals are believed to be the primary hosts of the virus. Majority of such cases are considered to be human-to-human transmission, while a few are due to wild animals-to-human transmission and substantial burdens on healthcare system following this spread. To understand the dynamical behavior such diseases, we fitted a susceptible-infectious-quarantined model for human cases with constant proportions. We proposed a model that provide better constraints on understanding the climaxes of such unseen disastrous spread, relevant consequences, and suggesting future imperative strategies need to be adopted. The main features of the work include the positivity, boundedness, existence and uniqueness of solution of the model. The conditions were derived under which the COVID-19 may extinct or persist in the population. Sensitivity and estimation of those important parameters have been carried out that plays key role in the transmission mechanism. To optimize the spread of such disease, we present a control problem for further analysis using two control measures. The necessary conditions have been derived using the Pontryagin's maximum principle. Parameter values have been estimated from the real data and experimental numerical simulations are presented for comparison as well as verification of theoretical results. The obtained numerical results also present the verification, accuracy, validation, and robustness of the proposed scheme.","Din, Anwarud; Li, Yongjin; Khan, Tahir; Zaman, Gul",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,427

The epidemic accelerated in Philadelphia, PA, in the spring of 2020, with the city experiencing a first peak of infections on 15 April, followed by a decline through midsummer. Here, we investigate spread of the epidemic in the first wave in Philadelphia using full-genome sequencing of 52 SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from 27 hospitalized patients collected between 30 March and 17 July 2020. Sequences most commonly resembled lineages circulating at earlier times in New York, suggesting transmission primarily from this location, though a minority of Philadelphia genomes matched sequences from other sites, suggesting additional introductions. Multiple genomes showed even closer matches to other Philadelphia isolates, suggestive of ongoing transmission within Philadelphia. We found that all of our isolates contained the D614G substitution in the viral spike and belong to lineages variously designated B.1, Nextstrain clade 20A or 20C, and GISAID clade G or GH. There were no viral sequence polymorphisms detectably associated with disease outcome. For some patients, genome sequences were determined longitudinally or concurrently from multiple body sites. In both cases, some comparisons showed reproducible polymorphisms, suggesting initial seeding with multiple variants and/or accumulation of polymorphisms after infection. These results thus provide data on the sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Philadelphia and begin to explore the dynamics within hospitalized patients.IMPORTANCE Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 spreads globally and within infected individuals is critical to the development of mitigation strategies. We found that most lineages in Philadelphia had resembled sequences from New York, suggesting infection primarily but not exclusively from this location. Many genomes had even nearer neighbors within Philadelphia, indicating local spread. Multiple genome sequences were available for some subjects and in a subset of cases could be shown to differ between time points and body sites within an individual, indicating heterogeneous viral populations within individuals and raising questions on the mechanisms responsible. There was no evidence that different lineages were associated with different outcomes in patients, emphasizing the importance of individual-specific vulnerability.","Everett, John; Hokama, Pascha; Roche, Aoife M; Reddy, Shantan; Hwang, Young; Kessler, Lyanna; Glascock, Abigail; Li, Yize; Whelan, Jillian N; Weiss, Susan R; Sherrill-Mix, Scott; McCormick, Kevin; Whiteside, Samantha A; Graham-Wooten, Jevon; Khatib, Layla A; Fitzgerald, Ayannah S; Collman, Ronald G; Bushman, Frederic",mBio (Online),,427

The ongoing pandemic demonstrates the importance of having an emergency response plan that accounts for the safety of frontline healthcare workers, including those working in critical care settings. Objectives To explore Australian critical care nurses’ knowledge, preparedness and experiences of managing patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Methods An exploratory cross-sectional study of Australian critical care nurses was conducted between June and September 2020. An anonymous online survey was sent to Australian College of Critical Care Nurses (ACCCN) members to collect information about their knowledge, preparedness and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise and report data. Results A total of 157 critical care nurses participated, with 138 fully complete surveys analysed. Most respondents reported ‘good’ to ‘very good’ level of knowledge about COVID-19, and obtained up-to-date COVID-19 information from international and local sources. To manage patients with COVID-19, 82.3% felt sufficiently prepared at the time of data collection, and 93.4% had received specific education, training or instruction. Most participants were involved in assessing (89.3%) and treating (92.4%) COVID-19 patients. Varying levels of concerns about contracting SARS-CoV-2 were expressed by respondents, and 55.7% thought the pandemic had increased their workload. The most frequent concerns expressed by participants were a lack of appropriate PPE and fear of the PPE shortage. Conclusions While most nurses expressed sufficient preparedness for managing COVID-19 patients, specific education had been undertaken and experiential learning was evident. Fears of insufficient or appropriate PPE made the response more difficult for nurses and the community. Preparedness and responsiveness are critical to successful management of the COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases.","Nahidi, Shizar Sotomayor-Castillo Cristina Li Cecilia Currey Judy Elliott Rosalind Shaban Ramon Z.",Australian Critical Care,,427

Foram utilizadas imagens do satélite Landsat-5, sensor TM, órbitas 218 e 219, ponto 76, bandas 3 e 4 na obtenção do índice de vegetação com diferença normalizada (NDVI). Foi feita a subtração de NDVI para obtenção da alteração de cobertura vegetal ou vigor de biomassa em intervalos de um ano, e dados de ocorrência de focos de raiva agregados por município corrigidos pelo efetivo herbívoro no respectivo ano. Diferenças significativas foram obtidas na comparação das médias de alteração de NDVI para ganho, perda e alteração geral em todo período pelo teste de Wilcoxon, exceto de 1996 a 1997 e seqüência de somatória de rankings negativos de 1998 a 2002. A análise de correlação entre diminuição de NDVI e focos de raiva corrigidos foi significativa em 2002 e 2003. Para ganho de NDVI, foi significativo em 1998 e 2003. Para alteração geral foi significativa em 2002. Houve correlação significativa de aumento de NDVI e focos de raiva corrigidos em 2000, 2002 e 2004, com r > 0 em todo período, exceto 2002 e observadas correlações entre alteração, geral e de perda, e tamanho de rebanho significativas em 2000, 2002, 2004 e 2006. A correlação positiva entre alteração de NDVI e rebanho herbívoro sugere a alteração do tamanho do rebanho como um fator de alteração da cobertura vegetal e conseqüente aumento da ocorrência de raiva pela alteração do habitat do morcego hematófago, principal hospedeiro do vírus rábico na América do Sul. A implantação da Coordenadoria de Defesa Agropecuária (CDA) da Secretaria de Agricultura e Abastecimento de São Paulo, em 1999 e a obrigatoriedade da vacinação contra a raiva, a partir de 2002, podem ter encoberto a correlação positiva encontrada no período anterior, de 1996 a 1999. Após o controle da raiva ter se consolidado, a alteração de NDVI voltou a apresentar correlação positiva, devendo ser considerada de fato fator de risco para a ocorrência de raiva nos herbívoros. A metodologia proposta no estudo pode ser uma alternativa no estudo de alteração ambiental como fator de risco na epidemiologia de doenças infecciosas, porém refinamento da técnica pode ser considerado a fim de controlar influências de condições atmosféricas e época do ano nas imagens utilizadas","Ywasaki, Fernanda",,,427

426096,“Homemade”: The Vicious Circle of Household Pharmaceutical Waste,2020,"The rapid dynamics of COVID-19 calls for quick and effective tracking of virus transmission chains and early detection of outbreaks, especially in the ""phase 2"" of the pandemic, when lockdown and other restriction measures are progressively withdrawn, in order to avoid or minimize contagion resurgence. For this purpose, contact-tracing apps are being proposed for large scale adoption by many countries. A centralized approach, where data sensed by the app are all sent to a nation-wide server, raises concerns about citizens' privacy and needlessly strong digital surveillance, thus alerting us to the need to minimize personal data collection and avoiding location tracking. We advocate the conceptual advantage of a decentralized approach, where both contact and location data are collected exclusively in individual citizens' ""personal data stores"", to be shared separately and selectively (e.g., with a backend system, but possibly also with other citizens), voluntarily, only when the citizen has tested positive for COVID-19, and with a privacy preserving level of granularity. This approach better protects the personal sphere of citizens and affords multiple benefits: it allows for detailed information gathering for infected people in a privacy-preserving fashion; and, in turn this enables both contact tracing, and, the early detection of outbreak hotspots on more finely-granulated geographic scale. The decentralized approach is also scalable to large populations, in that only the data of positive patients need be handled at a central level. Our recommendation is two-fold. First to extend existing decentralized architectures with a light touch, in order to manage the collection of location data locally on the device, and allow the user to share spatio-temporal aggregates-if and when they want and for specific aims-with health authorities, for instance. Second, we favour a longer-term pursuit of realizing a Personal Data Store vision, giving users the opportunity to contribute to collective good in the measure they want, enhancing self-awareness, and cultivating collective efforts for rebuilding society.","Nanni, Mirco; Andrienko, Gennady; Barabási, Albert-László; Boldrini, Chiara; Bonchi, Francesco; Cattuto, Ciro; Chiaromonte, Francesca; Comandé, Giovanni; Conti, Marco; Coté, Mark; Dignum, Frank; Dignum, Virginia; Domingo-Ferrer, Josep; Ferragina, Paolo; Giannotti, Fosca; Guidotti, Riccardo; Helbing, Dirk; Kaski, Kimmo; Kertesz, Janos; Lehmann, Sune; Lepri, Bruno; Lukowicz, Paul; Matwin, Stan; Jiménez, David Megías; Monreale, Anna; Morik, Katharina; Oliver, Nuria; Passarella, Andrea; Passerini, Andrea; Pedreschi, Dino; Pentland, Alex; Pianesi, Fabio; Pratesi, Francesca; Rinzivillo, Salvatore; Ruggieri, Salvatore; Siebes, Arno; Torra, Vicenc; Trasarti, Roberto; Hoven, Jeroen van den; Vespignani, Alessandro",Ethics Inf Technol,,427
426225,A Tale of Two Bailouts: Effects of TARP and PPP on Subprime Consumer Debt (preprint),2021,"OBJECTIVE: A higher body mass index (BMI) has become acknowledged as one of the important risk factors for developing critical condition in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition to BMI, body composition, particularly visceral adiposity, might be an even more accurate measure to stratify patients. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association between the distributions of CT-quantified fat mass and critical condition of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in five databases for studies published until 17th November 2020. In the meta-analysis, we calculated pooled mean difference (standardized mean difference; SMD) of visceral fat area (VFA; cm2 ) between patients in intensive care unit (ICU) and general ward, and between patients with and without IMV requirement. RESULTS: Our quantitative synthesis revealed that patients requiring intensive care had higher VFA values (SMD=0.46, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.71, p<0.001) compared to patients on the general ward. Similarly, patients requiring IMV had higher VFA values (SMD=0.38, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.71, p=0.026) compared to patients without IMV requirement. CONCLUSIONS: We found that VFA values were significantly higher in patients with critical condition. Therefore, abdominal adiposity seems to be a risk factor in COVID-19, and patients with central obesity might need special attention.","Földi, Mária; Farkas, Nelli; Kiss, Szabolcs; Dembrovszky, Fanni; Szakács, Zsolt; Balaskó, Márta; Eross, Bálint; Hegyi, Péter; Szentesi, Andrea",Obesity (Silver Spring),,427

However, this technique raises concerns about data privacy and its overall effectiveness. This paper contributes to this debate as it provides a systematic review of digital contact tracing studies between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021. Following the PRISMA protocol for systematic reviews and the CHEERS statement for quality assessment, 580 papers were initially screened, and 19 papers were included in a qualitative synthesis. We add to the current literature in three ways. First, we evaluate whether digital contact tracing can mitigate COVID-19 by either reducing the effective reproductive number or the infected cases. Second, we study whether digital is more effective than manual contact tracing. Third, we analyze how proximity/location awareness technologies affect data privacy and population participation. We also discuss proximity/location accuracy problems arising when these technologies are applied in different built environments (i.e., home, transport, mall, park). This review provides a strong rationale for using digital contact tracing under specific requirements. Outcomes may inform current digital contact tracing implementation efforts worldwide regarding the potential benefits, technical limitations, and trade-offs between effectiveness and privacy.","Grekousis, George Liu Ye",Sustainable Cities and Society,,427

428976,Flexible global working arrangements: An integrative review and future research agenda,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is causing a pandemic of COVID-19, with high infectivity and significant mortality1. Currently, therapeutic options for COVID-19 are limited. Historically, metal compounds have found use as antimicrobial agents, but their antiviral activities have rarely been explored. Here, we test a set of metallodrugs and related compounds, and identify ranitidine bismuth citrate, a commonly used drug for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, as a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent, both in vitro and in vivo. Ranitidine bismuth citrate exhibited low cytotoxicity and protected SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with a high selectivity index of 975. Importantly, ranitidine bismuth citrate suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication, leading to decreased viral loads in both upper and lower respiratory tracts, and relieved virus-associated pneumonia in a golden Syrian hamster model. In vitro studies showed that ranitidine bismuth citrate and its related compounds exhibited inhibition towards both the ATPase (IC50 = 0.69 µM) and DNA-unwinding (IC50 = 0.70 µM) activities of the SARS-CoV-2 helicase via an irreversible displacement of zinc(II) ions from the enzyme by bismuth(III) ions. Our findings highlight viral helicase as a druggable target and the clinical potential of bismuth(III) drugs or other metallodrugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Yuan, Shuofeng; Wang, Runming; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Cheng, Tianfan; Chik, Kenn Ka-Heng; Ye, Zi-Wei; Wang, Suyu; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Jin, Lijian; Li, Hongyan; Jin, Dong-Yan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Sun, Hongzhe",Nat Microbiol,,427

Consequently, multiple federal and state governments have placed restrictions on hospitals such as limiting ""elective surgery"" and recommending social or physical distancing. We review the literature on several areas that have been affected including surgical selection, inpatient care, and physician well-being. These areas affecting inpatient paradigms include surgical priority, physical or social distancing, file sharing for online clinical communications, and physician wellness. During this crisis, it is important that orthopaedic departments place an emphasis on personnel safety and slowing the spread of the virus so that the department can still maintain vital functions. Physical distancing and emerging technologies such as inpatient telemedicine and online file sharing applications can enable orthopaedic programs to still function while attempting to protect medical staff and patients from the novel coronavirus spread. This literature review sought to provide evidence-based guidance to orthopaedic departments during an unprecedented time. Orthopaedic surgeons should follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when appropriate, have teams created using physical distancing, understand the department's policy on elective surgery, and engage in routines which enhance physician wellness.","Massey, Patrick A; McClary, Kaylan; Zhang, Andrew S; Savoie, Felix H; Barton, R Shane",J Am Acad Orthop Surg,,427

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the morphology and timing of cutaneous reactions after mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: A provider-facing registry-based study collected cases of cutaneous manifestations after COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: From December 2020 to February 2021, we recorded 414 cutaneous reactions to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna (83%) and Pfizer (17%). Delayed large local reactions were most common, followed by local injection site reactions, urticarial eruptions, and morbilliform eruptions. Forty-three percent of patients with first-dose reactions experienced second-dose recurrence. Additional less common reactions included pernio/chilblains, cosmetic filler reactions, zoster, herpes simplex flares, and pityriasis rosea-like reactions. LIMITATIONS: Registry analysis does not measure incidence. Morphologic misclassification is possible. CONCLUSIONS: We report a spectrum of cutaneous reactions after mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We observed some dermatologic reactions to Moderna and Pfizer vaccines that mimicked SARS-CoV-2 infection itself, such as pernio/chilblains. Most patients with first-dose reactions did not have a second-dose reaction and serious adverse events did not develop in any of the patients in the registry after the first or second dose.

432510,Transport and mobility justice: Evolving discussions,2020,"Molecular diagnosis and surveillance of pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 depend on nucleic acid isolation. Pandemics at the scale of COVID-19 can cause a global shortage of proprietary commercial reagents and BSL-2 laboratories to safely perform testing. Therefore, alternative solutions are urgently needed to address these challenges. An open-source method, magnetic-nanoparticle-aided viral RNA isolation from contagious samples (MAVRICS), built upon readily available reagents, and easily assembled in any basically equipped laboratory, is thus developed. The performance of MAVRICS is evaluated using validated pathogen detection assays and real-world and contrived samples. Unlike conventional methods, MAVRICS works directly in samples inactivated in phenol-chloroform (e.g., TRIzol), thus allowing infectious samples to be handled safely without biocontainment facilities. MAVRICS allows wastewater biomass immobilized on membranes to be directly inactivated and lysed in TRIzol followed by RNA extraction by magnetic nanoparticles, thereby greatly reducing biohazard risk and simplifying processing procedures. Using 39 COVID-19 patient samples and two wastewater samples, it is shown that MAVRICS rivals commercial kits in detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus. Therefore, MAVRICS is safe, fast, and scalable. It is field-deployable with minimal equipment requirements and could become an enabling technology for widespread testing and wastewater monitoring of diverse pathogens.","Ramos-Mandujano, Gerardo; Salunke, Rahul; Mfarrej, Sara; Rachmadi, Andri Taruna; Hala, Sharif; Xu, Jinna; Alofi, Fadwa S; Khogeer, Asim; Hashem, Anwar M; Almontashiri, Naif A M; Alsomali, Afrah; Shinde, Digambar B; Hamdan, Samir; Hong, Pei-Ying; Pain, Arnab; Li, Mo",Glob Chall,,427
432589,Network model and analysis of the spread of Covid-19 with social distancing,2020,"Background: Novel coronavirus disease has spread rapidly worldwide. As recent radiological literatures on Covid-19 related pneumonia is primarily focused on CT findings, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends using portable chest X-radiograph (CXR). A tool to assist for detection and monitoring of Covid-19 cases from CXR is highly required. Purpose: To develop a fully automatic framework to detect Covid-19 related pneumonia using CXR images and evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods: In this study, a novel deep learning model, named CovIDNet (Covid-19 Indonesia Neural-Network), was developed to extract visual features from chest x-ray images for the detection of Covid-19 related pneumonia. The model was trained and validated by chest x-rays datasets collected from several open source provided by GitHub and Kaggle. Results and Discussion: In the validation stage using open-source data, the accuracy to recognize Covid-19 and others classes reaches 98.44%, that is, 100% Covid-19 precision and 97% others precision. Discussion: The use of the model to classify Covid-19 and other pathologies might slightly decrease the accuracy. Although SoftMax was used to handle classification bias, this indicates the benefit of additional training upon the introduction of new set of data. Conclusion: The model has been tested and get 98.4% accuracy for open source datasets, the sensitivity and specificity are 100% and 96.97%, respectively.","Ramadhan, M. M.; Faza, A.; Lubis, L.

We evaluated three commercial serologic assays as stand-alone tests and as components of two-test algorithms. Two nucleocapsid antibody tests (Abbott IgG and Roche total antibody) and one spike protein antibody test (DiaSorin IgG) were included. We assessed sensitivity using 128 serum samples from symptomatic PCR-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-infected patients and specificity using 1,204 samples submitted for routine serology prior to COVID-19's emergence, plus 64 pandemic-era samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative patients with respiratory symptoms. Assays were evaluated as stand-alone tests and as components of a two-test algorithm in which positive results obtained using one assay were verified using a second assay. The two nucleocapsid antibody tests were more sensitive than the spike protein antibody test overall (70% and 70% versus 57%; P &#8804; 0.003), with pronounced differences observed using samples collected 7 to 14 days after symptom onset. All three assays were comparably sensitive (&#8805;89%; P &#8805; 0.13) using samples collected >14 days after symptom onset. Specificity was higher using the nucleocapsid antibody tests (99.3% and 99.7%) than using the spike protein antibody test (97.8%; P &#8804; 0.002). When any two assays were paired in a two-test algorithm, the specificity was 99.9% (P < 0.0001 to 0.25 compared with the individual assays), and the positive predictive value (PPV) improved substantially, with a minimal effect on the negative predictive value (NPV). In conclusion, two nucleocapsid antibody tests outperformed a spike protein antibody test. Pairing two different serologic tests in a two-test algorithm improves the PPV, compared with the individual assays alone, while maintaining the NPV.","Turbett, Sarah E; Anahtar, Melis; Dighe, Anand S; Garcia Beltran, Wilfredo; Miller, Tyler; Scott, Hannah; Durbin, Sienna Marie; Bharadwaj, Maheetha; Thomas, Jason; Gogakos, Tasos S; Astudillo, Michael; Lennerz, Jochen; Rosenberg, Eric S; Branda, John A",J. clin. microbiol,,427

435636,Planning for a world beyond COVID-19: Five pillars for post-neoliberal development,2021,"Masks, now recommended and worn by a growing proportion of the world's population, have reflected various perceived meaning across time. This paper provides a brief history of the socio-cultural perceptions attached to wearing a mask by surveying how masks were perceived in ancient Greece and Rome, the origins of medical masks, and the ascribed socio-cultural meaning of masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of a mask has historically diverse perceived meanings; currently, wearing a mask communicates a bipolar socio-cultural meaning and a nuanced, divisive symbology. To some, masks communicate a belief in medical science and a desire to protect one's neighbor from contagion. To others, a mask communicates oppression, government overreach, and a skepticism toward established scientific principles. It is the mask's ability to signal a deception, or extrapolated more broadly, a value system, that is highly relevant to current public health guidelines encouraging mask use to decrease the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health officials and providers should utilize evidence-based health communication strategies when findings warrant a reversed recommendation of a symbol (such as masks) with a legacy of socio-cultural underpinnings that are deep-seated, complex, and emotional.","Ike, John David; Bayerle, Henry; Logan, Robert A; Parker, Ruth M",J Health Commun,,427

At Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), we have integrated and systematized health-related values discussions led by oncology nurses for newly diagnosed cancer patients as part of routine comprehensive cancer care. Such conversations include not only the patient's wishes for care at the end of life but also more holistic personal values, including sources of strength, concerns, hopes, and their definition of an acceptable quality of life. In addition, health care providers use a structured template to document their discussions of patient goals of care. OBJECTIVE: To provide ready access to key information about the patient as a person with individual values, goals, and preferences, we undertook the creation of the Patient Values Tab in our center's EHR to display this information in a single, central location. Here, we describe the interprofessional, interdisciplinary, iterative process and user-centered design methodology that we applied to build this novel functionality as well as our initial implementation experience and plans for evaluation. METHODS: We first convened a working group of experts from multiple departments, including medical oncology, health informatics, information systems, nursing informatics, nursing education, and supportive care, and a user experience designer. We conducted in-depth, semistructured, audiorecorded interviews of over 100 key stakeholders. The working group sought consensus on the tab's main content, homing in on high-priority areas identified by the stakeholders. The core content was mapped to various EHR data sources. We established a set of high-level design principles to guide our process. Our user experience designer then created wireframes of the tab design. The designer conducted usability testing with physicians, nurses, and other health professionals. Data validation testing was conducted. RESULTS: We have already deployed the Patient Values Tab to a pilot sample of users in the MSK Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology Service, including physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, and administrative staff. We have early evidence of the positive impact of this EHR innovation. Audit logs show increasing use. Many of the initial user comments have been enthusiastically positive, while others have provided constructive suggestions for additional tab refinements with respect to format and content. CONCLUSIONS: It is our challenge and obligation to enrich the EHR with information about the patient as a person. Realization of this capability is a pressing public health need requiring the collaboration of technological experts with a broad range of clinical leaders, users, patients, and families to achieve solutions that are both principled and practical. Our new Patient Values Tab represents a step forward in this important direction.","Desai, Anjali Varma; Michael, Chelsea L; Kuperman, Gilad J; Jordan, Gregory; Mittelstaedt, Haley; Epstein, Andrew S; Connor, MaryAnn; B Villar, Rika Paula; Bernal, Camila; Kramer, Dana; Davis, Mary Elizabeth; Chen, Yuxiao; Malisse, Catherine; Markose, Gigi; Nelson, Judith E",J Med Internet Res,,427

436139,The impact of wasted products during lockdown on medical aesthetic clinics,2021,"BACKGROUND: To investigate intention rates to get vaccinated against COVID-19 among healthcare personnel (HCP) in Greece. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey. RESULTS: The response rate was 14.5%. Of 1521 HCP with a known profession, 607 (39.9%) were nursing personnel, 480 (31.6%) physicians, 171 (11.2%) paramedical personnel, 72 (4.7%) supportive personnel, and 191 (12.6%) administrative personnel. Overall, 803 of 1571 HCP (51.1%) stated their intention to get vaccinated while 768 (48.9%) stated their intention to decline vaccination. Most HCP (71.3%) who reported intent to get vaccinated noted contributing to the control of the pandemic and protecting their families and themselves as their reasons, while the most common reason for reporting intent to decline vaccination was inadequate information about the vaccines (74.9%), followed by concerns about vaccine safety (36.2%). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the probability of intending to get vaccinated increased with male gender, being a physician, history of complete vaccination against hepatitis B, history of vaccination against pandemic A (H1N1) in 2009-2010, belief that COVID-19 vaccination should be mandatory for HCP, and increased confidence in vaccines in general during the COVID-19 pandemic. The following factors were associated with a lower intention to get vaccinated: no vaccination against influenza the past season, no intention to get vaccinated against influenza in 2020-2021, and no intention to recommend COVID-19 vaccination to high-risk patients. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need to built safety perception towards COVID-19 vaccines and raise vaccine uptake rates by HCP, and thus to protect the healthcare workforce and the healthcare services.","Maltezou, Helena C; Pavli, Androula; Dedoukou, Xanthi; Georgakopoulou, Theano; Raftopoulos, Vasilios; Drositis, Ioannis; Bolikas, Emmanouil; Ledda, Caterina; Adamis, Georgios; Spyrou, Andronikos; Karantoni, Eleni; Gamaletsou, Maria N; Koukou, Dimitra Maria; Lourida, Athanasia; Moussas, Nikolaos; Petrakis, Vasilios; Panagopoulos, Periklis; Hatzigeorgiou, Dimitrios; Theodoridou, Maria; Lazanas, Marios; Gargalianos, Panagiotis; Sipsas, Nikolaos V",Infect.

As of 12.44 GMT on 15 January 2021, it has produced 93,640,296 cases and 2,004,984 deaths. The use of mathematical modelling was applied in Italy, Spain, and UK to help in the prediction of this pandemic. We used equations from general and reduced logistic models to describe the epidemic development phenomenon and the trend over time. We extracted this information from the Italian Ministry of Health, the Spanish Ministry of Health, Consumer Affairs, and Social Welfare, and the UK Statistics Authority from 3 February to 30 April 2020. We estimated that, from the seriousness of the phenomenon, the consequent pathology, and the lethal outcomes, the COVID-19 trend relate to the same classic laws that govern epidemics and their evolution. The curve d(t) helps to obtain information on the duration of the epidemic phenomenon, as its evolution is related to the efficiency and timeliness of the system, control, diagnosis, and treatment. In fact, the analysis of this curve, after acquiring the data of the first three weeks, also favors the advantage to formulate forecast hypotheses on the progress of the epidemic.","Boselli, Pietro M; Basagni, Massimo; Soriano, Jose M",,,427

Our study aims to assess the early impact of COVID-19 lockdown on violent and accidental deaths in Peru. Based on data from the Peruvian National Death Information System, an interrupted time series analysis was performed to assess the immediate impact and change in the trend of COVID-19 lockdown on external causes of death including homicide, suicide, and traffic accidents. The analysis was stratified by sex and the time unit was every 15 days. All forms of deaths examined presented a sudden drop after the lockdown. The biggest drop was in deaths related to traffic accidents, with a reduction of 12.22 deaths per million men per month (95% CI: -14.45, -9.98) and 3.55 deaths per million women per month (95% CI:-4.81, -2.30). Homicide and suicide presented similar level drop in women, while the homicide reduction was 2.5 the size of the suicide reduction in men. The slope in homicide in men during the lock-down period increased by 6.66 deaths per million men per year (95% CI:3.18, 10.15). External deaths presented a sudden drop after the lockdown was implemented and an increase in homicide in men was observed. Falls in mobility have a natural impact on traffic accidents, however, the patterns for suicide and homicide are less intuitive and reveal important characteristics of these events, although we expect all of these changes to be transient.","Calderon-Anyosa, Renzo J C; Kaufman, Jay S",Prev Med,,427

Nonetheless, data are lacking regarding the management of EES during the pandemic. The object of this study was to understand current worldwide practices pertaining to EES for skull base/pituitary tumors during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and provide a basis for the formulation of guidelines. METHODS: The authors conducted a web-based survey of skull base surgeons worldwide. Different practices by geographic region and COVID-19 prevalence were analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-five unique responses were collected. Regarding the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), North America reported using more powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), and Asia and Europe reported using more standard precautions. North America and Europe resorted more to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for screening asymptomatic patients. High-prevalence countries showed a higher use of PAPRs. The medium-prevalence group reported lower RT-PCR testing for symptomatic cases, and the high-prevalence group used it significantly more in asymptomatic cases.Nineteen respondents reported transmission of COVID-19 to healthcare personnel during EES, with a higher rate of transmission among countries classified as having a medium prevalence of COVID-19. These specific respondents (medium prevalence) also reported a lower use of airborne PPE. In the cases of healthcare transmission, the patient was reportedly asymptomatic 32% of the time. CONCLUSIONS: This survey gives an overview of EES practices during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Intensified preoperative screening, even in asymptomatic patients, RT-PCR for all symptomatic cases, and an increased use of airborne PPE is associated with decreased reports of COVID-19 transmission during EES.","Champagne, Pierre-Olivier; McDowell, Michael M; Wang, Eric W; Snyderman, Carl H; Zenonos, Georgios A; Gardner, Paul A",Neurosurg Focus,,427

Susceptibility has been associated with age, biological sex, and other prior existing health conditions. However, host genes are involved in viral infectivity and pathogenicity, and polymorphisms in these could be responsible for the interethnic/interindividual variability observed in infection and progression of COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Clinical exome data of 103 individuals was analyzed to identify sequence variants in five selected candidate genes: ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD209, IFITM3, and MUC5B to assess their prevalence and role to understand the COVID-19 infectivity and progression in our population. Results: A total of 497 polymorphisms were identified in the five selected genes in the exomes analyzed. Thirty-eight polymorphisms identified in our cohort have been reported earlier in literature and have functional significance or association with health conditions. These variants were classified into three groups: protective, susceptible, and responsible for comorbidities. Discussion and Conclusion: The two polymorphisms described in literature as risk inducing are rs35705950 in MUC5B gene and TMPRSS2 haplotype (rs463727, rs34624090, rs55964536, rs734056, rs4290734, rs34783969, rs11702475, rs35899679, and rs35041537) were absent in our cohort explaining the slower infectivity of the disease in this part of India. The 38 functional variants identified can be used as a predisposition panel for the COVID-19 infectivity and progression and stratify individuals as “high or low risk,” which would help in planning appropriate surveillance and management protocols. A larger study from different regions of India is warranted to validate these results.","Iyer, Gayatri R.; Samajder, Sayani; Zubeda, Syeda; Devi Soorya Narayana, S.; Mali, Vishakha; PV, Sharath Krishnan; Sharma, Anuradha; Abbas, Neyha Zainab; Bora, Nandini Shyamali; Narravula, Amulya; Hasan, Qurratulain",Front.

438934,"Facing the current challenges of global geopolitics, how is the strategic autonomy of the European Union articulated in the framework of its foreign and security policy?",2020,"A concurrent infection of chicken anemia virus (CAV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was detected in Japanese native chicks in 2017, in which a high mortality rate (97.7%) was recorded in a small flock of 130 chicks exhibiting poor growth. Histological examination revealed that the affected chicks exhibited two different pathological entities: one was severe hematopoietic and lymphocytic depletion with abnormally large cells containing intranuclear inclusion bodies of CAV, whereas the other was renal tubular necrosis due to IBV infection. Immunohistochemistry detected CAV antigens in the bone marrow, liver, and spleen as well as IBV antigens in the kidneys, trachea, and air sacs. CAV was isolated from the liver sample of the chicks, and the isolated strain was designated as CAV/Japan/HS1/17. A phylogenetic analysis of the CAV VP1 gene revealed that CAV/Japan/HS1/17 is genetically similar to Chinese strains collected from 2014 to 2016. An experimental infection was performed using CAV/Japan/HS1/17 and specific-pathogen-free chicks to determine the pathogenicity of CAV/Japan/HS1/17. The isolate caused 100% anemia and 70% mortality to chicks inoculated at one day old, 80% of chicks inoculated at seven days old also developed anemia, and 10% died from CAV infection. These results suggest that the unusually high mortality in Japanese native chicks can be attributed to dual infection with both CAV and IBV. The results of the experimental infection suggest that CAV/Japan/HS1/17 has a pathogenic potential to specific-pathogen-free chicks and a relatively higher pathogenicity than previous Japanese CAV strains.","Hosokawa, Kumiko; Imai, Kunitoshi; Dong, Hieu Van; Ogawa, Haruko; Suzutou, Madoka; Linn, Sandi Htein; Kurokawa, Aoi; Yamamoto, Yu",J Vet Med Sci,,427

As a result of social distancing policies, the risk for loneliness and associated decline in quality of life has increased. The current study examined factors associated with loneliness and quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic cross-sectionally (n = 797) and longitudinally (n = 395). Older age and larger social network size were associated with less loneliness, whereas having multiple physical or mental health diagnoses was associated with greater loneliness. Greater virtual social contact was also associated with increased loneliness. Greater loneliness was associated with all domains of quality of life both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Understanding factors associated with loneliness is critical to developing effective strategies at reducing loneliness and improving quality of life during the pandemic. Contrary to popular perceptions, older age was associated with less loneliness and more virtual social contact was associated with more loneliness. Thus, it may be prudent to deemphasize virtual social contact in public campaigns and to emphasize safe methods of interacting in person.","Rumas, Rachel; Shamblaw, Amanda L; Jagtap, Shreya; Best, Michael W",Psychiatry Res,,427

443009,Criminal Justice in the Time of a Pandemic,2020,"The emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 as a global pandemic has increased popular concerns about diseases caused by viruses. Fermented foods containing high loads of viable fungi and bacteria are potential sources for virus contamination. The most common include viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophage) and yeasts reported in fermented milks, sausages, vegetables, wine, sourdough, and cocoa beans. Recent molecular studies have also associated fermented foods as vehicles for pathogenic human viruses. Human noroviruses, rotavirus, and hepatitis virus have been identified in different fermented foods through multiple routes. No severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus or close members were found in fermented foods to date. However, the occurrence/persistence of other pathogenic viruses reveals a potential vulnerability of fermented foods to SARS-CoV-2 contamination. On the other side of the coin, some bacteriophages are being suggested for improving the fermentation process and food safety, as well as owing potential probiotic properties in modern fermented foods. This review will address the diversity and characteristics of viruses associated with fermented foods and what has been changed after a short introduction to the most common next-generation sequencing platforms. Also, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via fermented foods and preventive measures will be discussed.","Maske, Bruna Leal; de Melo Pereira, Gilberto Vinícius; da Silva Vale, Alexander; Marques Souza, Doris Sobral; De Dea Lindner, Juliano; Soccol, Carlos Ricardo",Food Microbiol,,427

A debate on the nursing professional identity and its need for change,2021,"Today, reverse logistics (RL) is one of the main activities of supply chain management that covers all physical activities associated with return products (such as collection, recovery, recycling and destruction). In this regard, the designing and proper implementation of RL, in addition to increasing the level of customer satisfaction, reduces inventory and transportation costs. In this paper, in order to minimize the costs associated with fixed costs, material flow costs, and the costs of building potential centres, a complex integer linear programming model for an integrated direct logistics and RL network design is presented. Due to the outbreak of the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) at the beginning of 2020 and the consequent increase in medical waste, the need for an inverse logistics system to manage waste is strongly felt. Also, due to the worldwide vaccination in the near future, this waste will increase even more and careful management must be done in this regard. For this purpose, the proposed RL model in the field of COVID-19 waste management and especially vaccine waste has been designed. The network consists of three parts - factory, consumers' and recycling centres - each of which has different sub-parts. Finally, the proposed model is solved using the cuckoo optimization algorithm, which is one of the newest and most powerful meta-heuristic algorithms, and the computational results are presented along with its sensitivity analysis.","Shadkam, Elham",Waste Manag Res,,427

However, data on IPC compliance among healthcare workers in COVID-19 treatment centers are unknown in Ghana. This study aims to assess IPC compliance among healthcare workers in Ghana's COVID-19 treatment centers. The study was a secondary analysis of data, which was initially collected to determine the level of risk of COVID-19 virus infection among healthcare workers in Ghana. Quantitative data were conveniently collected using the WHO COVID-19 risk assessment tool. We analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses. We observed that IPC compliance during healthcare interactions was 88.4% for hand hygiene and 90.6% for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) usage; IPC compliance while performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), was 97.5% for hand hygiene and 97.5% for PPE usage. For hand hygiene during healthcare interactions, lower compliance was seen among nonclinical staff [OR (odds ratio): 0.43; 95% CI (Confidence interval): 0.21-0.89], and healthcare workers with secondary level qualification (OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.08-0.71). Midwives (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.09-0.93) and Pharmacists (OR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.02-0.92) compliance with hand hygiene was significantly lower than registered nurses. For PPE usage during healthcare interactions, lower compliance was seen among healthcare workers who were separated/divorced/widowed (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01-0.43), those with secondary level qualifications (OR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01-0.43), non-clinical staff (OR 0.16 95% CI 0.07-0.35), cleaners (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.05-0.52), pharmacists (OR: 0.07; 95% CI: 0.01-0.49) and among healthcare workers who reported of insufficiency of PPEs (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.14-0.77). Generally, healthcare workers' infection prevention and control compliance were high, but this compliance differs across the different groups of health professionals in the treatment centers. Ensuring an adequate supply of IPC logistics coupled with behavior change interventions and paying particular attention to nonclinical staff is critical in minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the treatment centers.","Ashinyo, Mary Eyram; Dubik, Stephen Dajaan; Duti, Vida; Amegah, Kingsley Ebenezer; Ashinyo, Anthony; Asare, Brian Adu; Ackon, Angela Ama; Akoriyea, Samuel Kaba; Kuma-Aboagye, Patrick",PLoS One,,427

To assess the effects of COVID-19 on the outdoor recreation participation and subjective well-being of adolescents, as well as how participation in outdoor activities may mitigate declines in subjective well-being, we used a Qualtrics XM panel to conduct a nationally representative survey of youth ages 10-18 across the United States (n = 624) between 30 April and 15 June 2020. Survey questions focused on frequency of participation in outdoor activities before and during the pandemic, as well as changes in subjective well-being. Paired t-tests revealed decreases in both outdoor recreation participation (64% reported declines) and subjective well-being (52% reported declines). A regression model examining correlates of changes in subjective well-being (R2 = 0.42) revealed strong associations with changes in outdoor play (B = 0.44, p < 0.001) and nature-based (B = 0.21, p = 0.016) activities. Adolescents' from all backgrounds who participated in these activities during the pandemic reported smaller declines in subjective well-being. Results highlight the critical role that time outdoors and time in nature play in bolstering adolescents' resilience to stressors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and underscore the need to facilitate outdoor recreation opportunities for youth during times of crisis.","Jackson, S Brent; Stevenson, Kathryn T; Larson, Lincoln R; Peterson, M Nils; Seekamp, Erin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,427

The “Same line Same standard Same quality” (Santong) program has been implemented to improve food quality in the Chinese domestic market. The Santong program means that exporters are encouraged to produce goods on the same production line, following the same standards and the same quality requirements for both the export target market and the domestic market. Using data collected from an online choice experiment on tomatoes, we examine Chinese consumer preferences and their willingness to pay (WTP) for the Santong claim, export target market quality and organic certification. Three types of export target market, indicating different technical regulations and standards, are considered. Our results show that consumers are willing to pay for the Santong quality claim and for export goods with a target market of “EU”. Furthermore, we also identify the substitution effects between the Santong claim and organic certification. The results of our study provide solutions for both Chinese exporters and the Chinese government to meet the need for a high level of food quality accompanied by domestic consumption upgrade and achieve the transformation from export to domestic sales. Our results may also provide solutions for other emerging economies, where governments raise the level of food quality in domestic markets and support the domestic sales of exporters after the shock of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in 2019.","Bai, Lin Zhu Zhanguo Zhang Tong",Sustainability,,427

In this context, it is becoming insufficient to apply classical principles of economic security, which is characterized by the ability to pursue a company's own economic policy thus responding to abrupt geopolitical changes in the form of measures to localize and neutralize threats. A mathematical model is proposed for evaluating pseudo-security, which can be applied when assessment of the generally accepted indicators does not contribute to maintaining sustainability. It is proposed to consider the mutual influence of various indicators and their latent behaviour to avoid ineffective spending on the preservation/strengthening of a particular developmental path.

For this reason, it is necessary to analyze the knowledge and the different actions in the management of thromboprophylaxis in work environments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, descriptive and cross-sectional study with data collection through a Google® form with 19 questions for professionals involved in the care of COVID-19. 414 surveys were received. The quantitative variables were represented with means and standard deviation and the qualitative variables with percentages and confidence intervals. RESULTS: 414 surveys analyzed. 58.2% were women. The most participatory age group was 56-65 years. 95.2% stated that COVID-19 patients had a higher risk of VTE and peripheral arterial microthrombosis. 93.6% considered that outpatient COVID-19 patients should receive thromboprophylaxis. 60.5% of the physicians did not know any protocol for the evaluation of thrombotic risk in these patients. Low molecular weight heparin was considered the main treatment for thromboprophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of doctors consider that COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of suffering VTE and peripheral arterial microthrombosis than the general population, however more than a third do not assess the thrombotic risk and a significant percentage claim not to know protocols to evaluate said risk. The survey highlights the training needs of our professionals in thromboprophylaxis so that our patients receive healthcare with the highest possible quality.","García Vallejo, O; Frías Vargas, M; Gil Gil, I; Vázquez Gómez, N; Piera Carbonell, A; Peiró Morant, J","SEMERGEN, Soc.

We analyzed plasma samples from 471 hospitalized patients recruited through the prospective multicenter ISARIC4C study and 39 outpatients with mild disease, enabling extensive characterization of responses across a full spectrum of COVID-19 severity. Progressive elevation of levels of numerous inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (including IL-6, CXCL10, and GM-CSF) were associated with severity and accompanied by elevated markers of endothelial injury and thrombosis. Principal component and network analyses demonstrated central roles for IL-6 and GM-CSF in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Comparing these profiles to archived samples from patients with fatal influenza, IL-6 was equally elevated in both conditions whereas GM-CSF was prominent only in COVID-19.

This article presents the rationale for potentially using old drugs (emetine, other ipecac alkaloids or analogues) that have been used to treat amoebiasis in the treatment of COVID-19. Emetine had amongst the lowest reported half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) from over 290 agents screened for the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses. While EC50 concentrations of emetine are achievable in the blood, studies show that concentrations of emetine can be almost 300 times higher in the lungs. Furthermore, based on the relative EC50s of emetine towards the coronaviruses compared with Entamoeba histolytica, emetine could be much more effective as an anti-coronavirus agent than it is against amoebiasis. This paper also discusses the known side effects of emetine and related compounds, how those side effects can be managed, and the optimal method of administration for the potential treatment of COVID-19. Given the serious and immediate threat that the COVID-19 coronavirus poses, our long history with emetine and the likely ability of emetine to reach therapeutic concentrations within the lungs, ipecac, emetine, and other analogues should be considered as potential treatment options, especially if in vitro studies confirm viral sensitivity.","Bleasel, Martin D; Peterson, Gregory M",,,427
451668,Facts Upon Delivery: What Is Rhetorical About Visualized Models?,2020,"BACKGROUND: It has been observed that subjects with comorbidities related to metabolic syndrome (MetS) as hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diabetes mellitus (DM2) show severe cases and a higher mortality by COVID-19. To date, there is little information available on the impact of the interaction between these comorbidities in the risk of death by COVID-19. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the impact of the combinations of MetS components in overall survival (OS) and risk of death among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Using public data of the Ministry of Health, suspected, and confirmed COVID-19 cases from February 25-June 6, 2020 was analyzed. Mortality odds ratio (OR) was calculated with a univariate analysis (95% CI) and attributable risk. Interactions between components and survival curves were analyzed and a multivariate logistics regression analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The analysis included 528,651 cases out of which 202,951 were confirmed for COVID-19. Probabilities of OS among confirmed patients were 0.93, 0.89, 0.87, 0.86, and 0.83 while the OR of multivariate analysis was 1.83 (1.77-1.89), 2.58 (2.48-2.69), 2.83 (2.66-3.01), and 3.36 (2.83-3.99) for zero, one, two, three, and four MetS components, respectively. The combination with the highest risk was DM2â¯+â¯hypertension at 2.22 (2.15-2.28), and the attributable risk for any component was 9.35% (9.21-9.49). Only the combination obesityâ¯+â¯CVD showed no significant interaction. CONCLUSION: The presence of one MetS component doubles the risk of death by COVID-19, which was higher among patients with DM2â¯+â¯hypertension. Only obesity and CVD do not interact significantly.","León-Pedroza, José Israel; Rodríguez-Cortés, Octavio; Flores-Mejía, Raúl; Gaona-Aguas, Cinthia Vianney; González-Chávez, Antonio",Arch. med. res,,427
451717,Covid-19: UK government writes off £13.4bn of hospital debts to ease pressures,2020,"Despite the importance of having robust estimates of the time-asymptotic total number of infections, early estimates of COVID-19 show enormous fluctuations. Using COVID-19 data from different countries, we show that predictions are extremely sensitive to the reporting protocol and crucially depend on the last available data point before the maximum number of daily infections is reached. We propose a physical explanation for this sensitivity, using a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model, where the parameters are stochastically perturbed to simulate the difficulty in detecting patients, different confinement measures taken by different countries, as well as changes in the virus characteristics. Our results suggest that there are physical and statistical reasons to assign low confidence to statistical and dynamical fits, despite their apparently good statistical scores. These considerations are general and can be applied to other epidemics.","Faranda, Davide; Castillo, Isaac Pérez; Hulme, Oliver; Jezequel, Aglaé; Lamb, Jeroen S W; Sato, Yuzuru; Thompson, Erica L",Chaos,,427

452155,"Ambient temperature, air pollution and childhood bronchiolitis",2021,"Adolescents often suffer from short and mistimed sleep. To counteract the resulting daytime sleepiness they frequently consume caffeine. However, caffeine intake may exaggerate sleep problems by disturbing sleep and circadian timing. In a 28-hour double-blind randomized crossover study, we investigated to what extent caffeine disturbs slow-wave sleep (SWS) and delays circadian timing in teenagers. Following a 6-day ambulatory phase of caffeine abstinence and fixed sleep-wake-cycles, 18 male teenagers (14-17 years old) ingested 80 mg caffeine vs. placebo in the laboratory four hours prior to an electro-encephalographically (EEG) monitored nighttime sleep episode. Data were analyzed using both frequentist and Bayesian statistics. The analyses suggest that subjective sleepiness is reduced after caffeine compared to placebo. However, we did not observe a substantial influence of the given dose neither on subjective sleep quality nor on SWS, but rather a high inter-individual variability in caffeine-induced SWS changes. Exploratory analyses suggest that particularly those individuals with a higher level of SWS during placebo reduced SWS in response to caffeine. Regarding salivary melatonin onsets, caffeine-induced delays were not evident at group level, and only observed in participants exposed to a higher caffeine dose relative to individual bodyweight (i.e., a dose >1.3mg/kg). Together, the results suggest that 80 mg caffeine are sufficient to induce alertness at a subjective level. However, particularly teenagers with a strong need for deep sleep might pay for these subjective benefits by a loss of SWS during the night. Thus, caffeine-induced sleep-disruptions might change along with the maturation of sleep need.","Reichert, Carolin F; Veitz, Simon; Bühler, Miriam; Gruber, Georg; Deuring, Gunnar; Rehm, Sophia S; Rentsch, Katharina; Garbazza, Corrado; Meyer, Martin; Slawik, Helen; Lin, Yu-Shiuan; Weibel, Janine",Biochem Pharmacol,,427

452497,Stewardship as process: A paradox perspective,2020,"Traditional data systems require specialized technical skills where users need to understand the data organization and write precise queries to access data. Therefore, novice users who lack technical expertise face hurdles in perusing and analyzing data. Existing tools assist in formulating queries through keyword search, query recommendation, and query auto-completion, but still require some technical expertise. An alternative method for accessing data is Query by Example (QBE), where users express their data exploration intent simply by providing examples of their intended data. We study a state-of-the-art QBE system called SQuID, and contrast it with traditional SQL querying. Our comparative user studies demonstrate that users with varying expertise are significantly more effective and efficient with SQuID than SQL. We find that SQuID eliminates the barriers in studying the database schema, formalizing task semantics, and writing syntactically correct SQL queries, and thus, substantially alleviates the need for technical expertise in data exploration.","Fariha, Anna; Cousins, Lucy; Mahyar, Narges; Meliou, Alexandra",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14800v2.pdf,427

Mobility data represent an important proxy measure of social distancing, and here, we characterise the relationship between transmission and mobility for 52 countries around the world. Transmission significantly decreased with the initial reduction in mobility in 73% of the countries analysed, but we found evidence of decoupling of transmission and mobility following the relaxation of strict control measures for 80% of countries. For the majority of countries, mobility explained a substantial proportion of the variation in transmissibility (median adjusted R-squared: 48%, interquartile range - IQR - across countries [27-77%]). Where a change in the relationship occurred, predictive ability decreased after the relaxation; from a median adjusted R-squared of 74% (IQR across countries [49-91%]) pre-relaxation, to a median adjusted R-squared of 30% (IQR across countries [12-48%]) post-relaxation. In countries with a clear relationship between mobility and transmission both before and after strict control measures were relaxed, mobility was associated with lower transmission rates after control measures were relaxed indicating that the beneficial effects of ongoing social distancing behaviours were substantial.","Nouvellet, Pierre; Bhatia, Sangeeta; Cori, Anne; Ainslie, Kylie E C; Baguelin, Marc; Bhatt, Samir; Boonyasiri, Adhiratha; Brazeau, Nicholas F; Cattarino, Lorenzo; Cooper, Laura V; Coupland, Helen; Cucunuba, Zulma M; Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina; Dighe, Amy; Djaafara, Bimandra A; Dorigatti, Ilaria; Eales, Oliver D; van Elsland, Sabine L; Nascimento, Fabricia F; FitzJohn, Richard G; Gaythorpe, Katy A M; Geidelberg, Lily; Green, William D; Hamlet, Arran; Hauck, Katharina; Hinsley, Wes; Imai, Natsuko; Jeffrey, Benjamin; Knock, Edward; Laydon, Daniel J; Lees, John A; Mangal, Tara; Mellan, Thomas A; Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma; Parag, Kris V; Pons-Salort, Margarita; Ragonnet-Cronin, Manon; Riley, Steven; Unwin, H Juliette T; Verity, Robert; Vollmer, Michaela A C; Volz, Erik; Walker, Patrick G T; Walters, Caroline E; Wang, Haowei; Watson, Oliver J; Whittaker, Charles; Whittles, Lilith K; Xi, Xiaoyue; Ferguson, Neil M",Nat Commun,,427

The aim of paper is to present the incidence of skin tumors in a single center from 2017 to 2019, describe trends in its frequency and find relations between neoplasms and sex, type of cancer, and its size. An analysis of histopathological files from the surgical department between 2017 and 2019 was calculated. These items were selected: sex, age, type of skin cancer, subtype of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), grading of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), localization and dimensions of the tumor. The study sample consisted of 387 cases. BCC was the most common cancer and its nodular type was the most frequent. In older patients, the vertical dimension of excised carcinoma was significantly larger. Moreover, this connection was detected only in women compared to men. There were statistically significant differences between dimensions of the skin cancer and sex. In men group, skin cancers had statistically higher vertical dimensions and larger surface areas. On the face and head, BCC more often localizes in the nasal area, while SCC on the auricle. It has been demonstrated that the older the patient, the larger the vertical dimension of the tumor. As such, tumor size is larger in men than in women, as women usually see their physicians sooner than men: cosmetic concerns are more important to them.","Fijalkowska, Marta; Koziej, Mateusz; Antoszewski, Boguslaw",Sci Rep,,427

However, research on DT as a profound organizational change process, as well as salespeople's individual psychological reactions to such initiatives, is still limited. Although DT offers salespeople more and better resources for work-related goal attainment, it increases job demands and typically generates high uncertainty, which companies must then manage. We draw on job demands-resources (JD-R) theory to account for these bright and dark side effects simultaneously. We analyze the direct, mediated, and moderated effects of uncertainty reduction initiatives (resources) and excessive workload (demands) on the perceived usefulness of DT (i.e. salespeople's motivation to embrace it), the stress it generates, and the ultimate success of DT integration. In doing so, we shed light on the complex pattern of relationships that characterizes salespeople's psychological reactions to DT. Using DT context-specific constructs, we test our model and hypotheses on a sample of 144 salespeople of a firm engaged in DT. Our results fill several gaps in the technology in sales, DT, and JD-R literatures, and we provide managers with several guidelines to better manage DT in sales.","Guenzi, P.; Nijssen, E.

454364,Smart City Data Sensing during COVID-19: Public Reaction to Accelerating Digital Transformation,2021,"Rationale: Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) are key regulators of sodium channel inactivation. Mutations in these critical proteins have been implicated in human diseases including Brugada syndrome, idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias, and epileptic encephalopathy. The underlying ionic mechanisms by which reduced sodium channel availability in Fhf2 knockout mice predisposes to abnormal excitability at the tissue level are not well defined. Objective: Using animal models and theoretical multicellular linear strands, we examined how FHF2 orchestrates the interdependency of sodium, calcium, and gap junctional conductances to safeguard cardiac conduction. Methods and Results: Fhf2KO mice were challenged by reducing calcium conductance using verapamil or by reducing gap junctional conductance using carbenoxolone or by backcrossing into a connexin 43 heterozygous (Cx43+/-) background. All conditions produced conduction block in Fhf2KO mice, with Fhf2WT showing normal impulse propagation. To explore the ionic mechanisms of block in Fhf2KO hearts, multicellular linear strand models incorporating FHF2-deficient sodium channel inactivation properties were constructed and faithfully recapitulated conduction abnormalities seen in mutant hearts. The mechanisms of conduction block in mutant strands with reduced calcium conductance or gap junction uncoupling are very different. Enhanced sodium channel inactivation due to FHF2 deficiency shifts dependence onto calcium current to sustain electrotonic driving force, axial current flow, and action potential generation from cell-to-cell. In the setting of gap junction uncoupling, slower charging time from upstream cells conspires with accelerated sodium channel inactivation in mutant strands to prevent sufficient downstream cell charging for action potential propagation. Conclusions: FHF2-dependent effects on sodium channel inactivation ensure adequate sodium current reserve to safeguard against numerous threats to reliable cardiac impulse propagation.","Park, David S; Shekhar, Akshay; Santucci Iii, John; Redel-Traub, Gabriel; Solinas, Sergio Mg; Mintz, Shana; Lin, Xianming; Chang, Ernest W; Narke, Deven; Xia, Yuhe; Goldfarb, Mitchell; Fishman, Glenn I",Circ. res,,427

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since July 2020 and promoted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented the use of DSCT after cerebrovascular CT angiography (CTA) among patients with AIS using a dual-layer spectral CT. We explored the presence of CE sources, as well as late myocardium iodine enhancement (LIE) and pulmonary thromboembolism. Among patients further undergoing transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) or cardiac CTA, we explored the diagnostic performance. RESULTS: Fifty consecutive patients with AIS who underwent DSCT after cerebrovascular CTA comprised the patient population. The confidence degree for excluding cardiac thrombi was significantly higher than for LIE (4.4±0.8 vs. 3.4±1.3, p<0.0001). DSCT identified a CE source in 4 (8%) and LIE in 24 (48%) patients. The iodine ratio of CE sources was significantly lower compared to the left atrial appendage of patients with no CE sources (0.25±0.1 mg/mL vs. 0.91±0.2 mg/mL, p<0.0001). TEE/cardiac CT, performed in 20 (40%) patients, identified a CE source in 5 (25%) cases, whereas DSCT identified 4 (20%), leading to a sensitivity and specificity of 80% (95% CI 28-99%) and 100% (95% CI 78-100%) respectively (kappa 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, we identified DSCT as a potential unsophisticated approach for the early triage of CE sources among patients with AIS undergoing CTA upon admission.","Rodríguez-Granillo, Gaston A; Cirio, Juan J; Ciardi, Celina; Caballero, Maria Laura; Ceron, Marcos; Bleise, Carlos; Diluca, Pablo; Lylyk, Pedro",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,427

Missense variants were found in 3 cytokine genes and 10 cytokine receptor genes. Computational analyses were conducted to detect the effects of these missense SNPs via cloud-based software tools. Also, the miRSNP database was used to explore whether SNPs in the 3'-UTR altered the miRNA binding efficiency for genes of cytokines and their receptors. Our in silico studies revealed that one SNP in the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) gene was predicted as deleterious using sorting intolerant from tolerant.

Here, we argue that biochemical reactions performed by two specific protein products of ISGs modulate central carbon metabolism to support a broad-spectrum antiviral response. We demonstrate that the metabolites generated by metalloenzymes nitric oxide synthase and the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme RSAD2 inhibit the activity of the housekeeping and glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). We discuss that this inhibition is likely to stimulate a range of metabolic and signalling processes to support a broad-spectrum immune response. Based on these analyses, we propose that inhibiting GAPDH in individuals with deteriorated cellular innate immune response like elderly might help in treating viral diseases such as COVID-19.","Ebrahimi, Kourosh H; Gilbert-Jaramillo, Javier; James, William S; McCullagh, James S O",FEBS j,,427

We present the clinical outcomes of HIV patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in a matched comparison with historical controls. METHODS: We conducted retrospective cohort study of HIV patients who were admitted for COVID-19 between March 2020 and April 2020 to Newark Beth Israel Medical Center. Data on baseline clinical characteristics and hospital course was documented and compared with that of a matched control group of COVID-19 patients who had no history of HIV. Kaplan Meier Survival curves and the log-rank tests were used to estimate and compare in-hospital survival between both unmatched and matched groups. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with HIV were hospitalized with COVID-19. Median age was 59 years. The rates of in-hospital death, the need for mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit admission were 13% (n=3), 9% (n=2) and 9% (n=2) respectively. The HIV infection was well controlled in all patients except for 3 patients who had presented with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). All AIDS patients were discharged home uneventfully. A one-to-one propensity matching identified 23 COVID-19 patients who served as a control group. In both pre- and post-match cohorts, survival between HIV and control groups were comparable.

456274,"Social distancing, politics and wealth",2021,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide public health crisis. At present, there are no effective antiviral drugs to treat COVID-19. Although some vaccines have been developed, late-stage clinical trials that allow licensure by regulatory agencies are still needed. Previous reports have indicated that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV are highly homologous and both use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to enter cells, and SARS-CoV infection reduces the ACE2 expression in the lung. Therefore, the analysis of genes co-expressed with ACE2 in the lung may uncover the underlying mechanism of COVID-19. Finally, we used the Connectivity map (Cmap) database to search for candidate drugs using transcriptome profiles of patients with COVID-19. Method: Based on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), indicated by the expression of RNAs isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells of patients with COVID-19, we performed functional enrichment analysis and hub gene cluster analysis. Furthermore, we identified genes co-expressed with ACE2 in healthy lung samples and analyzed the significant genes. Additionally, to identify several candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, we queried Cmap using DEGs and genes co-expressed with ACE2. Results and Conclusion: The up-regulated genes in the BALF cells of patients with COVID-19 are related to viral mRNA translation. The down-regulated genes are related to immune response functions. Genes positively correlated with ACE2 are related to immune defense and those negatively correlated are enriched in synaptic transmission functions. The results reflected prosperous viral proliferation and immune dysfunction in patients. Furthermore, ACE2 may not only mediate viral entrance, but also play an important role in immune defense. By using Cmap with transcriptome profiles of patients with COVID-19, we identified candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, such as amantadine and acyclovir.","Li, Zhonglin; Yang, Ling",Front Genet,,427

Understanding the mechanisms by which some individuals are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and why a subgroup of them are prone to experience severe pneumonia, and death should lead to a better approach and more effective treatments for COVID-19. Here, we focus our attention on ACE2, a primary receptor of SARS-CoV-2. We will discuss its biology, tissue expression, and post-translational regulation that determine its potential to be employed by SARS-CoV-2 for cell entry. Particular attention will be given to how the ACE2 soluble form can have a great impact on disease progression and thus be used in a potential therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, we will discuss repercussions that SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 binding has on the renin-angiotensin system and beyond. Indeed, although mostly neglected, ACE2 can also act on [des-Arg 937]-bradykinin of the kinin-kallikrein system regulating coagulation and inflammation. Thorough comprehension of the role that ACE2 plays in different pathways will be the key to assess the impact that SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 binding has on organismal physiology and will help us to find better therapies and diagnostic tools.","Scialo, Filippo; Daniele, Aurora; Amato, Felice; Pastore, Lucio; Matera, Maria Gabriella; Cazzola, Mario; Castaldo, Giuseppe; Bianco, Andrea",Lung,,427
457415,Pandemic economics: optimal dynamic confinement under uncertainty and learning,2020,"This article examines briefly why the Indian economy was slowing pre-pandemic. It further argues that India?s lockdown caused an unprecedented economic crisis;worse, India?s economic policy response was poor in its overall architecture in terms of the balance between fiscal and monetary policy measures. It does this not only for India but compares it to the international evidence on peer country government response, with superior consequences in the latter. It argues that had the fiscal response been more commensurate with the depth of the crisis and at least somewhat comparable to that of emerging market economies, the extremely adverse impact on employment, earnings and wages could have been mitigated. It closes by offering what could have been an alternative fiscal package for India. An adequate fiscal response, it argues, would have revived aggregate demand in the product market, and through it revived the labour market?in a classic Keynesian manner.JEL Codes: H3, H41, H51, H54, H62, I15, J6, J30","Mehrotra, Santosh",The Indian Economic Journal,,427
457535,Corporate expertise can help nonprofits weather pandemic,2020,"AbstractThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to more than 159 million confirmed cases with over 3.3 million deaths worldwide, but it remains mystery why most infected individuals (â¼98%) were asymptomatic or only experienced mild illness. The same mystery applies to the deadly 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which has puzzled the field for a century. Here we discuss dual potential properties of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic viruses that led to the high fatality rate in the small number (â¼2%) of severe cases, while most infected persons (probably &#8805;98% in the United States) were self-limited with mild symptoms, or even asymptomatic. These variations now have been postulated to have been impacted by polymorphisms of the sialic acid receptors in the general population. Since coronaviruses (CoVs) also recognize sialic acid receptors and cause severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemics and pandemics, similar principles of influenza virus evolution and pandemicity may also apply to CoVs. A potential common principle of pathogen/host co-evolution of influenza and CoVs under selection of host sialic acids in parallel with different epidemic and pandemic influenza and coronaviruses is discussed.","Jiang, Xi; Tan, Ming; Xia, Ming; Huang, Pengwei; Kennedy, Michael A",Emerg Microbes Infect,,427

The immunological changes associated with this infection are largely unknown. Methods: We evaluated the peripheral blood mononuclear cells profile of 63 patients with COVID-19 at diagnosis. We also assessed the presence of association with inflammatory biomarkers and the 28-day mortality. Results: Lymphocytopenia was present in 51 of 63 (80.9%) patients, with a median value of 720 lymphocytes/µl (IQR 520-1,135). This reduction was mirrored also on CD8+ (128 cells/µl, IQR 55-215), natural killer (67 cells/µl, IQR 35-158) and natural killer T (31 cells/µl, IQR 11-78) cells. Monocytes were preserved in total number but displayed among them a subpopulation with a higher forward and side scatter properties, composed mainly of cells with a reduced expression of both CD14 and HLA-DR. Patients who died in the 28 days from admission (N=10, 15.9%), when compared to those who did not, displayed lower mean values of CD3+ (337.4 cells/µl vs 585.9 cells/µl; p=0.028) and CD4+ cells (232.2 cells/µl vs 381.1 cells/µl; p=0.042) and an higher percentage of CD8+/CD38+/HLA-DR+ lymphocytes (13.5% vs 7.6%; p=0.026). Discussion: The early phases of COVID-19 are characterized by lymphocytopenia, predominance of Th2-like lymphocytes and monocytes with altered immune profile, which include atypical mononuclear cells.","Lombardi, Andrea; Trombetta, Elena; Cattaneo, Alessandra; Castelli, Valeria; Palomba, Emanuele; Tirone, Mario; Mangioni, Davide; Lamorte, Giuseppe; Manunta, Maria; Prati, Daniele; Ceriotti, Ferruccio; Gualtierotti, Roberta; Costantino, Giorgio; Aliberti, Stefano; Scaravilli, Vittorio; Grasselli, Giacomo; Gori, Andrea; Porretti, Laura; Bandera, Alessandra",Front Immunol,,427

Herein, we demonstrate that Rhodamine 6G (Rh-6G) dye conjugated DNA aptamer-attached gold nanostar (GNS)-based distance-dependent nanoparticle surface energy transfer (NSET) spectroscopy has the capability of rapid diagnosis of specific SARS-CoV-2 spike recombinant antigen or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus within 10 min. Because Rh-6G-attached single-stand DNA aptamer wrapped the GNS, 99% dye fluorescence was quenched because of the NSET process. In the presence of spike antigen or virus, the fluorescence signal persists because of the aptamer-spike protein binding. Specifically, the limit of detection for the NSET assay has been determined to be 130 fg/mL for antigen and 8 particles/mL for virus. Finally, we have demonstrated that DNA aptamer-attached GNSs can stop virus infection by blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding capability and destroying the lipid membrane of the virus.","Pramanik, Avijit; Gao, Ye; Patibandla, Shamily; Mitra, Dipanwita; McCandless, Martin G; Fassero, Lauren A; Gates, Kalein; Tandon, Ritesh; Ray, Paresh Chandra",J Phys Chem Lett,,427

458123,When international academic conferences go virtual,2021,"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified to cause acute respiratory disease in humans. An outbreak of this disease has been reported in mainland China with the city of Wuhan as the recognized epicenter. The disease has also been exported to other countries, including the Philippines, but the level of spread is still under control (as of 08 February 2020). To describe and predict the dynamics of the disease, several preliminary mathematical models are formulated by various international study groups. Here, the insights that can be drawn from these models are discussed, especially as inputs for designing strategies to control the epidemics. Proposed model-based strategies on how to prevent the spread of the disease in local setting, such as during social gatherings, are also presented. The model shows that the exposure time is a significant factor in spreading the disease. As crowd density increases, the higher the chance an infected person could infect other people. The attendees of the social gathering should have effective protection or preventive measures (e.g., administrative and engineering controls) to minimize further disease transmission.","Rabajante, J.

A total of 10,202 inpatients were diagnosed with COVID-19, of which 99 were PLWH. PLWH were younger (58.3 years (SD = 12.42) versus 64.32 years (SD = 16.77), p < 0.001) and had a higher prevalence of men (73.7% versus 57.9%, p = 0.002) and Blacks (43.4% versus 21.7%, p < 0.001) than the HIV-negative population. PLWH had a higher prevalence of malignancies (18% versus 7%, p = < 0.001), chronic liver disease (12% versus 3%, p < 0.001), and end-stage renal disease (11% versus 4%, p = 0.007). Use of a ventilator, admission to the ICU, and in-hospital mortality were not different. Of the 99 PLWH, 12 were virally unsuppressed and 9 had CD4% < 14. Two of the 12 virally unsuppressed patients and 4/9 patients with CD4% < 14 died. Ninety-one of the 99 PLWH were on treatment for HIV, and 5 of the 8 not on treatment died. Among PLWH with prior values, absolute CD4 count decreased an average of 192 cells/mm3 at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis (p < 0.001). Hospitalized patients with HIV and COVID-19 coinfection did not have worse outcomes than the general population. Among PLWH, those with CD4%<14 or not on treatment for HIV had higher mortality rates. Those PLWH who received IL-6 inhibitors had lower mortality rates. PLWH given antifungal medications, hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics (including azithromycin), steroids, and vasopressors had higher mortality rates.","Flannery, Sarah; Schwartz, Rebecca; Rasul, Rehana; Hirschwerk, David A; Wallach, Frances; Hirsch, Bruce; McGowan, Joseph",Int J STD AIDS,,427

This leads to a higher risk of more adverse effects occurring, which can lead to greater toxicity and therapeutic failures, among others. In the last decade more and more pharmacokinetic studies of antibiotics have been carried out in neonates, this recent evidence has led to new dosage recommendations taking into account the weight and gestational age of the newborn, among other variables, in agreement to the antibiotic studied.

465014,Touch: knowledge and considerations for nursing practice,2021,"Background: Varicocele is abnormal dilation of testis veins. The precise mechanism of varicocele is not fully understood despite some hypothesis were suggested in the literature. Disequilibrium between constrictor and dilatator mechanism of the veins have been shown to cause varicocele. High-grade varicoceles have been also linked to endothelial dysfunction and increased vasoconstriction. Objectives: We hypothesized that epicardial fat thickness (EFT), flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and aortic stiffness (AS) could be associated with varicocele. In the present study, we aimed to compare vascular parameters such as FMD, EFT and AS in healthy subjects and high-grade varicocele patients. Methods: The study population consisted of 35 men with high-grade varicocele and 32 age- and sex-matched control subjects younger than 45 years old. This is a cross-sectional study conducted at Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University Hospital between May to October 2018. Results: EFT, aortic diastolic diameters (AoDD) and EFT/BMI ratio were significantly higher in control group than in patients with high-grade (p=0.012, p=0.044, p=0.026, respectively). EFT and EFT /BMI ratio were significantly and inversely correlated with presence of varicocele (r=-0.422, p=0.009; r=-0.38, p=0.026, respectively). Conclusion: The present study suggests that high-grade varicocele may be associated with decreased echocardiographic EFT but not with aortic stiffness and FMD.","Sincer, Isa; Erdal, Emrah; Gucuk, Adnan; Bostanci, Emre; Gunes, Yilmaz",Afr Health Sci,,427

466395,"Training, assessments and examinations in the “new normal” era",2020,"BACKGROUND: Consumption patterns of people around the world have been tremendously affected due to the COVID-19 outbreak since December 2019. Previous studies validated the influence of both internal and external factors on consumer behaviour. However, due to the lack of empirical research, this study explored the influence of external factor such as COVID-19 on consumer purchase behaviour, economic and financial situation. In addition, the study investigated how crisis perception and consumption pattern vary due to demographic variables. METHODS: A convenience sampling technique was used and a total of 340 responses were collected from three countries, e.g., Bangladesh (n = 129), India (n = 122), and Pakistan (n = 89) using a structured questionnaire. The respondents rated the items, collected from relevant past studies, on a 5 point Likert scale ranging from highly disagree to highly agree. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis summarized all the measurement items into seven main factors from which two factors were removed due to low reliability. Except for the individual's financial situation, the overall mean values of the remaining factors were above 3.50 indicating a higher level of crisis perception and greater change in consumption patterns. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated that the factor scores were significantly different across countries, gender, education and income groups. In addition, Indian consumers were highly concerned and affected by COVID-19 followed by Pakistani and Bangladeshi consumers. In only one factor (e.g., an individual's financial situation), country and age had a significant interaction effect. Finally, the factors had significant difference among three categories of consumers (e.g., low, medium and high crisis perception). It indicates that consumers with higher crisis perception reported more behavioural changes due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, more COVID-19 crisis perception leads to significant changes in consumption pattern and the financial situation of the consumers. This study will enable academicians, marketers and decision-makers to understand different facets of consumer behaviour in three contagious countries namely Bangladesh, India and Pakistan in South Asia.","Hasan, S.; Islam, M.

466396,Attitudes of Suburban Kansan Parents Regarding School-Required Immunizations and the Influences of the Coronavirus Pandemic,2021,"Redox modulators have been developed as an attractive approach to treat cancer. Herein, we report the synthesis, identification, and biological evaluation of a quinazolinedione reactive oxygen species (ROS) inducer, QD394, with significant cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer cells. QD394 shows a transcriptomic profile remarkably similar to napabucasin, a cancer stemness inhibitor. Both small molecules inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation, increase cellular ROS, and decrease the GSH/GSSG ratio. Moreover, QD394 causes an iron- and ROS-dependent, GPX4 mediated cell death, suggesting ferroptosis as a major mechanism. Importantly, QD394 decreases the expression of LRPPRC and PNPT1, two proteins involved in mitochondrial RNA catabolic processes and both negatively correlated with the overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Pharmacokinetics-guided lead optimization resulted in the derivative QD394-Me, which showed improved plasma stability and reduced toxicity in mice compared to QD394. Overall, QD394 and QD394-Me represent novel ROS-inducing drug-like compounds warranting further development for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","Hu, Shuai; Sechi, Mario; Singh, Pankaj Kumar; Dai, Lipeng; McCann, Sean; Sun, Duxin; Ljungman, Mats; Neamati, Nouri",J. med. chem,,427
466647,Spread of Svalbard glacier mass loss to Barents Sea margins revealed by CryoSat-2,2020,"Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is an immune-mediated disease characterized by a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome in association with an antibody-mediated decrease of NMDAR. About 85% of patients respond to immunotherapy (and removal of an associated tumour if it applies), but it often takes several months or more than 1 year for patients to recover. There are no complementary treatments, beyond immunotherapy, to accelerate this recovery. Previous studies showed that SGE-301, a synthetic analogue of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, which is a potent and selective positive allosteric modulator of NMDAR, reverted the memory deficit caused by phencyclidine (a non-competitive antagonist of NMDAR), and prevented the NMDAR dysfunction caused by patients' NMDAR antibodies in cultured neurons. An advantage of SGE-301 is that it is optimized for systemic delivery such that plasma and brain exposures are sufficient to modulate NMDAR activity. Here, we used SGE-301 to confirm that in cultured neurons it prevented the antibody-mediated reduction of receptors, and then we applied it to a previously reported mouse model of passive cerebroventricular transfer of patient's CSF antibodies. Four groups were established: mice receiving continuous (14-day) infusion of patients' or controls' CSF, treated with daily subcutaneous administration of SGE-301 or vehicle (no drug). The effects on memory were examined with the novel object location test at different time points, and the effects on synaptic levels of NMDAR (assessed with confocal microscopy) and plasticity (long-term potentiation) were examined in the hippocampus on Day 18, which in this model corresponds to the last day of maximal clinical and synaptic alterations. As expected, mice infused with patient's CSF antibodies, but not those infused with controls' CSF, and treated with vehicle developed severe memory deficit without locomotor alteration, accompanied by a decrease of NMDAR clusters and impairment of long-term potentiation. All antibody-mediated pathogenic effects (memory, synaptic NMDAR, long-term potentiation) were prevented in the animals treated with SGE-301, despite this compound not antagonizing antibody binding. Additional investigations on the potential mechanisms related to these SGE-301 effects showed that (i) in cultured neurons SGE-301 prolonged the decay time of NMDAR-dependent spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents suggesting a prolonged open time of the channel; and (ii) it significantly decreased, without fully preventing, the internalization of antibody-bound receptors suggesting that additional, yet unclear mechanisms, contribute in keeping unchanged the surface NMDAR density. Overall, these findings suggest that SGE-301, or similar NMDAR modulators, could potentially serve as complementary treatment for anti-NMDAR encephalitis and deserve future investigations.","Mannara, Francesco; Radosevic, Marija; Planagumà, Jesús; Soto, David; Aguilar, Esther; García-Serra, Anna; Maudes, Estibaliz; Pedreño, Marta; Paul, Steven; Doherty, James; Quirk, Michael; Dai, Jing; Gasull, Xavier; Lewis, Mike; Dalmau, Josep",Brain,,427

467323,Room to Grieve,2020,"BACKGROUND: Testing is a key measure to control the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we empirically compared two SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies. METHODS: We used data from a Swiss single-centre, outpatient cohort study (n = 6,331 test results). A ""restricted"" strategy was applied to individuals with respiratory symptoms and/or fever and selected risk factors, or an epidemiological link and an ""extended"" strategy included any clinical symptoms without restriction, irrespective of risk factors and exposure. Data on infection, symptoms, viral load were collected during the first wave (March 11-April 21, 2020) and patients were followed up for clinical complications and hospitalisations until August 31, 2020. FINDINGS: Infection, clinical complications, and hospitalisation rates were lower for those in the extended strategy compared with the restricted strategy (17.2% vs. 25.0%, 12.3% vs. 20.8%, and 0.7% vs. 2.3%). In the whole cohort, participants included in the extended strategy had a lower number of symptoms (3.51 vs. 4.57; p < .001) and visits occurred earlier after symptom onset (0-3 days: 59.2% vs. 44.2%; p < .001). Among positive cases, the viral load was higher for the extended strategy (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlighted the crucial importance to implement a widespread testing strategy to achieve a better understanding of the infection, to mount an effective control response, by capturing people when their viral load is highest. A widespread test strategy should be available without barriers to help break the chains of transmission.","Baggio, Stéphanie; Spechbach, Hervé; Vernaz, Nathalie; Guessous, Idris; Gétaz, Laurent; Kaiser, Laurent; Chappuis, François; Salamun, Julien; Jacquerioz, Frédérique",PLoS One,,427

In this study, we sought to evaluate the dynamic changes of immunological and radiographic features, and the association with the outcome of pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Peripheral blood samples and radiographic data were collected longitudinally for up to 8 weeks from 158 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. The chest computed tomography (CT) scans were scored based on a semi-quantification assessment according to the extent of pulmonary abnormalities; the temporal change of the immunological and radiographic features was analyzed. Results: Compared with mild and moderate patients, severe patients had significantly decreased counts of lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD19+ B cells but dramatically elevated counts of neutrophils and levels of interleukin (IL)-6. Sequential monitoring showed a sustained increase in lymphocytes counts and significantly decreased levels of IL-6 in severe patients during the disease course. Notably, patients with persistent pulmonary lesions (CT score &#8805; 5 in week 8) showed high levels of IL-6 during the follow-up period, compared with those with recovery lesions (CT score < 5 in week 8). More importantly, the peak expression of IL-6 prior to the aggravated lung injury was mainly found in patients with persistent lesions, and multivariate analysis showed that IL-6 level upon admission was an independent factor associated with the persistent pulmonary injury.

467623,Opportunities and challenges for radar sensing for pandemics: COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Serologic testing for antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in potential donors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) may not be performed until after blood donation. A hospital-based recruitment program for CCP may be an efficient way to identify potential donors prospectively. METHODS: Patients who recovered from known or suspected COVID-19 were identified and recruited through medical record searches and public appeals in March and April 2020. Participants were screened with a modified donor history questionnaire and, if eligible, were asked for consent and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and IgM). Participants positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG were referred for CCP collection. RESULTS: Of 179 patients screened, 128 completed serologic testing and 89 were referred for CCP donation. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 23 of 51 participants with suspected COVID-19 and 66 of 77 participants with self-reported COVID-19 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG level met the US Food and Drug Administration criteria for ""high-titer"" CCP in 39% of participants confirmed by PCR, as measured by the Ortho VITROS IgG assay. A wide range of SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A hospital-based CCP donor recruitment program can prospectively identify potential CCP donors. Variability in SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels has implications for the selection of CCP units for transfusion.","Balcerek, Joanna; Trejo, Evelin; Levine, Kendall; Couey, Paul; Kornberg, Zoe V; Rogine, Camille; Young, Charlotte; Li, P Jonathan; Shy, Brian R; Taylor, Jordan E; Bakhtary, Sara; Friedlander, Terence; Lynch, Kara L; Bern, Caryn; Esensten, Jonathan H",Am. j. clin. pathol,,427

470299,Adjusting to life during a pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the majority of cases, the cause of stillbirth remains unknown despite detailed clinical and laboratory evaluation. Approximately 10 to 20% of stillbirths are attributed to chromosomal abnormalities. However, the causal nature of single-nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions in exomes has been understudied. METHODS: We generated exome sequencing data for 246 stillborn cases and followed established guidelines to identify causal variants in disease-associated genes. These genes included those that have been associated with stillbirth and strong candidate genes. We also evaluated the contribution of 18,653 genes in case-control analyses stratified according to the degree of depletion of functional variation (described here as ""intolerance"" to variation). RESULTS: We identified molecular diagnoses in 15 of 246 cases of stillbirth (6.1%) involving seven genes that have been implicated in stillbirth and in six disease genes that are good candidates for phenotypic expansion. Among the cases we evaluated, we also found an enrichment of loss-of-function variants in genes that are intolerant to such variation in the human population (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46 to 3.06). Loss-of-function variants in intolerant genes were concentrated in genes that have not been associated with human disease (odds ratio, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.41 to 3.34), findings that differ from those in two postnatal clinical populations that were also evaluated in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings establish the diagnostic utility of clinical exome sequencing to evaluate the role of small genomic changes in stillbirth. The strength of the novel risk signal (as generated through the stratified analysis) was similar to that in known disease genes, which indicates that the genetic cause of stillbirth remains largely unknown.

471019,The Agreement on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU and Euratom and its impact on the future application of state aid rules in the UK,2020,"The panic surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic has collapsed world economic systems. Thailand is no exception. Evidently, domestic-industrial activities in many countries have nearly stopped, and international sectors have abruptly disintegrated. Unemployment has become critical, and business viability has run into trouble. This article illustrates the potential solutions to these issues linked to Thailand’s domestic and international-trade economies by econometrically applying sectoral forecasting analyses and simulations because the pandemic has not only caused physical damage, but also a negative chain in worldwide economic systems. Methodologically, dynamic input-output (I-O) analysis is circumspectly employed to obtain foresight on some predominantly industrial sectors that could potentially rescue the Thai domestic economy from the depression of 2020–2022. The I-O tables are sourced from official data of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). For the international-trade scenario, the agent-based model and simulations are used to forecast the future trends of macroeconomic responses. The two methods, dynamic I-O models and agent-based simulations, are the current means capable of sensibly predicting macroeconomic responses for monitoring the upcoming years. The empirical outcomes can clearly predict upcoming events that will be beneficial for policy implementations. © The Author(s) 2021.","Chen, R.; Chaiboonsri, C.; Wannapan, S.",SAGE Open,,427

Data related to the applicability of the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) for risk stratification in patients with COVID-19 are currently lacking. We investigated the ability of CFS to predict need for mechanical ventilation and the duration of hospital stays in European patients with COVID-19. In total, 42 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to the University Medical Center Mainz between March 3 and April 15 2020 were included into this validation study and data were retrospectively analyzed. CFS was assessed at admission in all patients. Patients were followed for need for mechanical ventilation and time to hospital discharge. At admission, the median CFS was 3 (range: 1-7) and 14 (33.3%) patients were considered as at least pre-frail (CFS >3). 24 (57.1%) patients were discharged from hospital after a median time of 7 days (IQR 4-8). 12 (28.6%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required mechanical ventilation. In multivariable Cox regression analyses, higher CFS scores (HR 1.659, 95% CI 1.090 to 2.525, p=0.018) were an independent predictor for a higher risk of mechanical ventilation after adjusting for age, Charlson Comorbidity Index and quick sepsis-related organ failure score. Additionally, lower CFS scores (HR 0.554, 95% CI 0.312 to 0.983, p=0.043) were associated with earlier discharge from hospital.

Data were collected approximately five weeks after the World Health Organization declared that the Coronavirus was a pandemic. Participants (N = 405) were adults recruited throughout the U.S. This study examines data from parents (69% mothers and 31% fathers) with at least one child 0-12 years of age. The majority were White (71%) and 41% had at least a bachelor's degree. 78% of parents said they were educating their child at home due to COVID-19. Most (77.1%) reported use of online tools for at-home education, including educational apps, social media, and school-provided electronic resources. More than one-third (34.7%) of parents said their child's behavior had changed since the pandemic, including being sad, depressed, and lonely. Most parents were spending more time involved in daily caregiving of their children since COVID-19. Two out of every five parents met the PHQ-8 criteria for major depression or severe major depression (40.0%) and the GAD-7 criteria for moderate or severe anxiety (39.9%). Multivariate analyses indicated that, compared to non-depressed parents, parents who met criteria for probable major or severe depression (B = -.16, 95% CI = [-.29, -.02], p = .021) and parenting stress (B = -.37, 95% CI = [-.47, -.27], p < .001) were negatively associated with parents' perceived preparation to educate at home. Compared to parents with minimal or mild anxiety, parents with moderate or severe anxiety reported higher child anxiety scores (B = .17, 95% CI = [.06, .28], p = .002). Parenting stress was also positively associated with higher child anxiety scores (B = .40, 95% CI = [.32, .48], p < .001). Content analyses of open-ended questions indicated that school closures were a significant disruption, followed by lack of physical activity, and social isolation. Overall, study results suggested that parents' mental health may be an important factor linked to at-home education and child wellbeing during the pandemic.","Lee, Shawna J; Ward, Kaitlin P; Chang, Olivia D; Downing, Kasey M",Child Youth Serv Rev,,427

Neurological symptoms are more common with severe form of the disease. Through neuro-invasion, the virus can affect both neurons and glial cells and induce wide range of neurological pathologies. OBJECTIVES: To systematically assess the neurological manifestations in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases was performed. Randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, observational studies of neurological manifestations in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. RESULTS: All three-database search identified 89 publications. A total of 22 full-text articles assessed for eligibility with 12 articles excluded. Altogether, the included studies reported 290 patients with neurological manifestations. Neurological manifestations were subdivided into central causes (CNS) and peripheral causes (PNS). CNS symptoms is commoner representing 91% of all neurological patients with 9% only with PNS. Headache represented the commonest neurological symptoms in regard to number of patients, meanwhile dizziness has the highest incidence with 11.9%. Neurological manifestations were divided according to COVID-19 severity into: (1) nonsevere and (2) severe; with all CNS manifestations were more in severe patients except headache were more in nonsevere patients. All included studies were on adult patients except one study in pediatric patients with limited number of participants. CONCLUSIONS: From the descriptive analyses and available data of relatively small sample-sized studies, it can be concluded that in spite of the aforementioned limitations, that a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations including CNS and PNS can occur in COVID-19 patients.","Ibrahim, Wael",CNS Spectr,,427

Although preventive measures such as masking, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and improved ventilation are commonly used in schools to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and support in-person instruction (3-6), routine school-based COVID-19 testing has not been as widely implemented. In addition to these types of standard preventive measures, Utah health and school partners implemented two high school testing programs to sustain extracurricular activities and in-person instruction and help identify SARS-CoV-2 infections: 1) Test to Play,* in which testing every 14 days was mandated for participation in extracurricular activities; and 2) Test to Stay, which involved school-wide testing to continue in-person instruction as an alternative to transitioning to remote instruction if a school crossed a defined outbreak threshold (3).

However, efforts to provide a range of other social services must follow close behind. As a start, superintendents can look to their data systems to help them identify those students and families that are most likely to need social services to make it through this phase and beyond. But even while racing to ensure students’ health and safety, they cannot afford to ignore the longer-term challenges that their districts will face, given not just the need to move instruction online but also given that COVID-19 is all but guaranteed to do serious damage to state and local economies.","Starr, Joshua P.",Phi Delta Kappan,,427
476871,Mobility Based SIR Model For Pandemics -- With Case Study Of COVID-19,2020-04-26,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a problem worldwide, particularly due to the high rate of transmission and wide range of clinical manifestations. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure are the most common events observed in severe cases and can be fatal. Cytokine storm syndrome emerges as one of the possibilities for the development of ARDS and multiorgan failure in severe cases of COVID-19. This case report describes a case of a 53-year-old male patient who has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Further evaluation in this patient showed that there was a marked increase in IL-6 level in blood accompanied with hyperferritinemia, which was in accordance with the characteristic of cytokine storm syndrome. Patient was treated with tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody and is an antagonist to IL-6 receptor. The binding between tocilizumab and IL-6 receptors effectively inhibit and manage cytokine storm syndrome. Although this case report reported the efficacy of tocilizumab in managing cytokine storm syndrome, tocilizumab has several adverse effects requiring close monitoring. Further clinical randomized control trial is required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab administration in participants with various clinical characteristics and greater number of subjects.","Syam, A.

476991,A city of cities: Measuring how 15-minutes urban accessibility shapes human mobility in Barcelona,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health problem that causes millions of deaths worldwide. The clinical manifestation of COVID-19 widely varies from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and systemic inflammatory disease. It is thought that host genetic variability may affect the host's response to the virus infection and thus cause severity of the disease. The SARS-CoV-2 virus requires interaction with its receptor complex in the host cells before infection. The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been identified as one of the key molecules involved in SARS-CoV-2 virus receptor binding and cell invasion. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the correlation between a genetic variant within the human TMPRSS2 gene and COVID-19 severity and viral load. RESULTS: We genotyped 95 patients with COVID-19 hospitalised in Dr Soetomo General Hospital and Indrapura Field Hospital (Surabaya, Indonesia) for the TMPRSS2 p.Val160Met polymorphism. Polymorphism was detected using a TaqMan assay. We then analysed the association between the presence of the genetic variant and disease severity and viral load. We did not observe any correlation between the presence of TMPRSS2 genetic variant and the severity of the disease. However, we identified a significant association between the p.Val160Met polymorphism and the SARS-CoV-2 viral load, as estimated by the Ct value of the diagnostic nucleic acid amplification test. Furthermore, we observed a trend of association between the presence of the C allele and the mortality rate in patients with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate a possible association between TMPRSS2 p.Val160Met polymorphism and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and the outcome of COVID-19.","Wulandari, Laksmi; Hamidah, Berliana; Pakpahan, Cennikon; Damayanti, Nevy Shinta; Kurniati, Neneng Dewi; Adiatmaja, Christophorus Oetama; Wigianita, Monica Rizky; Husada, Dominicus; Tinduh, Damayanti; Prakoeswa, Cita Rosita Sigit; Endaryanto, Anang; Puspaningsih, Ni Nyoman Tri; Mori, Yasuko; Lusida, Maria Inge; Shimizu, Kazufumi; Oceandy, Delvac",Hum Genomics,,427

Moreover, the moderating effects of employees’ resilience and employment status are also examined. Analyzing the responses of 609 restaurant employees using structural equation modeling (SEM), findings revealed that all direct effects were supported, except for the effect of anticipated life satisfaction on intention to leave the restaurant industry. Lastly, the moderating role of resilience in the relationships between current life satisfaction and restaurant employees’ loyalty OCB and intentions to leave the industry was confirmed.

477444,COVID-19 as a Driver for Digital Transformation in Healthcare,2021,"Being a small island and low-middle income country (LMIC) heavily dependent on global markets for sustaining its basic needs and health system, Maldives faced specific challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was reinforced through tensions between the heavily centralized healthcare delivery and a partially decentralized public health system. Using the pillars of pandemic response proposed by the World Health Organisation, this article explores the planning assumptions, resource estimations and strategies adopted to equip the health system with resources for the pandemic response. The resource need estimates based on projections for COVID-19 identified a shortfall of medical professionals to care for patients while maintaining 55% of the workforce for regular healthcare across the atolls. The findings show that while the policy of lockdown bought time to increase hospital beds and devices, the country was unable to increase the healthcare workforce. Furthermore, as the lockdown eased, the exponential increase of cases took Maldives to the global one per capita incidence. Despite this, with cautious planning and use of resources, the country has so far managed to maintain low mortality from COVID-19. The lessons from this experience are paramount in future pandemic response planning, not only for Maldives, but other small island LMICs.","Usman, Sofoora Kawsar; Moosa, Sheena; Abdullah, Aminath Shaina",Int. j. health plann. manage,,427
477792,Probabilistic forecast reconciliation under the Gaussian framework,2021-03-20,"Decision-making using machine learning requires a deep understanding of the model under analysis. Variable importance analysis provides the tools to assess the importance of input variables when dealing with complex interactions, making the machine learning model more interpretable and computationally more efficient. In classification problems with imbalanced datasets, this task is even more challenging. In this article, we present two variable importance techniques, a nonparametric solution, called mh - χ2, and a parametric method based on Global Sensitivity Analysis. The mh - χ2 employs a multivariate continuous response framework to deal with the multiclass classification problem. Based on the permutation importance framework, the proposed mh - χ2 algorithm captures the dissimilarities between the distribution of misclassification errors generated by the base learner, Conditional Inference Tree, before and after permuting the values of the input variable under analysis. The GSA solution is based on the Covariance decomposition methodology for multivariate output models. Both solutions will be assessed in a comparative study of several Random Forest-based techniques with emphasis in the multiclass classification problem with different imbalanced scenarios. We apply the proposed techniques in two real application cases in order first, to quantify the importance of the 35 companies listed in the Spanish market index IBEX35 on the economic, political and social uncertainties reflected in economic newspapers in Spain during the first quadrimester of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and second, to assess the impact of energy factors on the occurrence of spike prices on the Spanish electricity market.","Ahrazem Dfuf, Ismael; Forte Perez-Minayo, Joaquin; Mira McWilliams, Jose Manuel; Gonzalez Fernandez, Camino",IEEE Access,,427

The findings suggest that there were gains and losses in terms of the pre-service teachers' ability to develop essential skills;classroom management skills suffered while formative assessment practices, innovative lesson delivery, and reflection on instruction were enhanced. The transition to remote learning also caused the way student teachers' skills were valued, as well as the effectiveness of their teaching, to change. How future teachers are prepared will need to be altered.

479808,Exploring student perceptions of virtual simulation versus traditional clinical and manikin-based simulation,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading all over the world. Health systems around the globe have to deal with decreased capabilities and exhausted resources because of the surge of patients. The need to identify COVID-19 patients to achieve a timely opportunity to treat and isolate them is an ongoing challenge for health care professionals everywhere. A lack of testing capabilities forces clinicians to make the crucial initial decision on the basis of clinical findings and routine diagnostic laboratory test. This article reviews the current literature and presents a new adapted protocol for diagnosing and triaging COVID-19 patients. A special emphasis lies on the stepwise approach guiding the medical provider to a triage decision that is suitable for the individual patient and the situation of the local medical treatment facility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: On March 30, 2020, a PubMed based literature research on COVID-19 following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines was performed. A diagnostic and triage tool for COVID-19 was designed based on the major findings in the reviewed literature. RESULTS: After a selection process, focusing on the topics ""epidemiology,"" ""clinical characteristics,"" and ""diagnostic tools,"" 119 out of a total amount of 1,241 publications were selected to get an overview of the growing evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The designed Early Recognition and Triage Tool enables the medical provider to use the applicable modules of the protocol for capabilities of the local setting to get the most appropriate diagnostic and triage done. The tool should give guidance for the initial approach until specific testing for the COVID-19 virus is available.","Jänig, Christoph; Gurney, Jennifer M; Froklage, Roger; Groth, Robin; Wirth, Christine; van de Krol, Hendrik; Schmidbauer, Willi; Güsgen, Christoph",Mil. med,,427

A rationalisation of resources and a specific treatment path were necessary. The study suggests a predictive model drawing on clinical data gathered by 119 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted in Busto Arsizio hospital. We derived a score that identifies the risk of clinical evolution and in-hospital mortality clustering patients into four groups. The study outcomes have been compared across the derivation and validation samples. The prediction rule is based on eight simple patient characteristics that were independently associated with study outcomes. It is able to stratify COVID-19 patients into four severity classes, with in-hospital mortality rates of 0% in group 1, 6-12.5% in group 2, 7-20% in group 3 and 60-86% in group 4 across the derivation and validation sample. The prediction model derived in this study identifies COVID-19 patients with low risk of in-hospital mortality and ICU admission. The prediction model that the study presents identifies COVID-19 patients with low risk of in-hospital mortality and admission to ICU. Moreover, it establishes an intermediate portion of patients that should be treated accurately in order to avoid an unfavourable clinical evolution. A further validation of the model is important before its implementation as a decision-making tool to guide the initial management of patients.","Foieni, Fabrizio; Sala, Girolamo; Mognarelli, Jason Giuseppe; Suigo, Giulia; Zampini, Davide; Pistoia, Matteo; Ciola, Mariella; Ciampani, Tommaso; Ultori, Carolina; Ghiringhelli, Paolo",Intern Emerg Med,,427

Therefore, assessment of depression in members of the general public and their psychological and behavioral responses is essential for the maintenance of health. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression and the associated factors among the general public during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey with convenience sampling was conducted from February 11 to 16, 2020, in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. A self-administrated smartphone questionnaire based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and psychological and behavioral responses was distributed to the general public. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were conducted to explore the associated factors of depression.aA cross-sectional survey with convenience sampling was conducted from February 11 to 16, 2020, in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. A self-administrated smartphone questionnaire based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and psychological and behavioral responses was distributed to the general public. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were conducted to explore the associated factors of depression. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression (PHQ-9 score &#8805;10) among the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic was 182/1342 (13.6%). Regression analysis indicated that feeling stressed, feeling helpless, persistently being worried even with support, never feeling clean after disinfecting, scrubbing hands and items repeatedly, hoarding food, medicine, or daily supplies, and being distracted from work or study were positively associated with depression, while social support and being calm were negatively associated with depression. CONCLUSIONS: The general public suffered from high levels of depression during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, COVID-19-related mood management and social support should be provided to attenuate depression in the general public.","Zhang, Weiyu; Yang, Xiaoting; Zhao, Jinfeng; Yang, Fengzhi; Jia, Yajing; Cui, Can; Yang, Xiaoshi",J Med Internet Res,,427

Evidence regarding the effects of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy is conflicting. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated in biological samples during pregnancy (placenta, umbilical cord or amniotic fluid); however, maternal and fetal effects of the virus are not well known. METHODS: Descriptive, multicentre, longitudinal, observational study in eight tertiary care hospitals throughout Spain, that are referral centres for pregnant women with COVID-19. All pregnant women with positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction during their pregnancy or 14 days preconception and newborns born to mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 will be included. They will continue to be followed up until 4 weeks after delivery. The aim of the study is to investigate both the effect of COVID-19 on the pregnancy, and the effect of the pregnancy status with the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 disease. Other samples (faeces, urine, serum, amniotic fluid, cord and peripheral blood, placenta and breastmilk) will be collected in order to analyse whether or not there is a risk of vertical transmission and to describe the behaviour of the virus in other fluids. Neonates will be followed until 6 months after delivery to establish the rate of neonatal transmission. We aim to include 150 pregnant women and their babies. Ethics approval will be obtained from all the participating centres. DISCUSSION: There is little information known about COVID-19 and its unknown effects on pregnancy. This study will collect a large number of samples in pregnant women which will allow us to demonstrate the behaviour of the virus in pregnancy and postpartum in a representative cohort of the Spanish population.","Suy, Anna; Garcia-Ruiz, Itziar; Carbonell, Melchor; Garcia-Manau, Pablo; Rodo, Carlota; Maiz, Nerea; Sulleiro, Elena; Anton, Andres; Esperalba, Juliana; Fernández-Hidalgo, Nuria; Frick, Marie Antoinette; Camba, Fatima; Pumarola, Tomas; Carreras, Elena",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,427

To what extent the pre-existing clinical condition and genetic background have implications for COVID-19 still needs to be explored. METHODS: Our study included 389,620 participants of European descent from the UK Biobank, of whom 3,884 received the COVID-19 test and 1,091 were tested positive for COVID-19. We examined the association of COVID-19 status with an extensive list of 974 medical conditions and 30 blood biomarkers. Additionally, we tested the association of genetic variants in two key genes related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), with COVID-19 or any other phenotypes. RESULTS: The most significant risk factors for COVID-19 include Alzheimer's disease (OR = 2.29, 95% CI: 1.25-4.16), dementia (OR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.36-3.42), and the overall category of delirium, dementia, amnestic and other cognitive disorders (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.24-2.90). Evidence suggesting associations of genetic variants in SARS-CoV-2 infection-related genes with COVID-19 (rs7282236, OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.14-1.54, p = 2.31 × 10-4) and other phenotypes, such as an immune deficiency (p = 5.65 × 10-5) and prostate cancer (p = 1.1 × 10-5), was obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Our unbiased and extensive search identified pre-existing Alzheimer's disease and dementia as top risk factors for hospital admission due to COVID-19, highlighting the importance of providing special protective care for patients with cognitive disorders during this pandemic.

The authors use the analogy of a hiker to illustrate how different researchers studying a similar phenomenon can choose among different research directions, which lead down different paths and offer different perspectives on a problem. Following the hiker analogy, the authors use the ""Research Compass"" to categorize the 15 research papers included in the 2020 Research in Medical Education supplement according to their research aim and corresponding methodological approach. The authors then discuss implications of the relative balance of these study types within this supplement and within health professions education research at large, emphasizing the critical importance of studying a topic from multiple vantage points to construct a richer and more nuanced understanding of health professions education challenges. The authors conclude by recognizing the challenges we face in the current era of COVID-19 and by calling health professions education researchers and practitioners to continue our collective efforts to improve learner education and patient care, as we together navigate the unfamiliar terrain of the present day.","Sewell, Justin L; Leep Hunderfund, Andrea N; Schumacher, Daniel J; Zaidi, Zareen",Acad Med,,427
484299,Positive impact of measures against COVID-19 on reducing influenza in the Northern Hemisphere,2020,"2019 novel coronaviruses (2019-nCoV) swept the world and are still at a high incidence stage. Highly sensitive and accurate nucleic acid molecular diagnostic techniques and methods have become a hot spot of global concern. 2019-nCoV is a kind of RNA virus. At present. there are many methods to detect virus RNA, including real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR), colloidal gold detection. chemiluminescence detection, and so on. Colloidal gold detection and chemiluminescence detection need to use monoclonal antibodies against 2019-nCoV, but there are some problems in the preparation of 2019-nCoV monoclonal antibodies, such as long cycle, complex preparation and easy pollution. So the above two methods are not easy to be established for the detection of 2019-nCoV. The superiority of PCR technology is widely used in auxiliary medical clinical diagnosis, customs inspection and quarantine, the development of new agriculture, national defense military defense, and basic research of bioscience, and so on. However, the quantification of the target DNA fragment in RT-PCR is still relatively quantitative. Because this technique mainly depends on CT value and standard curve to quantify the target DNA in the experiment which affects the amplification efficiency of the whole system, and the sensitivity and accuracy of the reaction system are greatly affected. Because the 2019-nCoV virus is highly contagious, the detection methodology is required to be highly sensitive, which is in line with the characteristics of digital PCR (droplet digital PCR system, referred to as ddPCR). ddPCR has the advantages of absolute quantification, high specificity, high sensitivity and strong interference ability, which can better combine molecular biology and medicine closely, and has a great advantage in the detection of 2019-nCoV. In this study, based on droplet digital PCR detection technology. the detection reagent and method were established using the principle of nested PCR. The Saliva of 333 2019-nCoV patients and their environmental samples were detected and compared with real-time PCR (RT-PCR). The linear range of the droplet digital PCR method established in this study was between 25-5 copies/A, and minimum detection limit was 0.5 copies/A. which was 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the commercial real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR detection technology. In 333 samples, 7 were positive in 197 environmental samples, and 9 were positive in 136 human samples. The detection accuracy was 100%, and the environmental micro-virus residues that could not be detected by RT-PCR were detected. The digital PCR detection method established in this study was highly specific, and the minimum detection limit was far lower than that of RT-PCR. It is of great significance for sensitive and accurate detection of 2019-nCoV infection. early infection and environmental microvirus.","Sun, T. T.; Jiang, Y. F.; Gong, P.; Yu, Y.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many trainings planned face-to-face were carried out remotely. In this study, our aim is to evaluate students' views on the efficiency of DAE, and to increase the efficiency of DAE in the future. METHODS: The questionnaire used in the study was applied to the first grade students in the Faculty of Medicine, at the Eskisehir Osmangazi University, in 2019-2020. 239 students completed the survey. The questionnaire consisted of the demographic information, that was obtained with voluntary consent, and sections containing suggestions on DAE, and its comparison with distance education of other basic medical science courses. The survey was prepared as a Likert scale (with 1 = totally disagree to 5 = totally agree), on Google forms and sent to the students online. RESULTS: 82.4% of the students marked ""totally disagree"" or ""disagree"" for the statement of ""DAE is more efficient than TAE"". The total percentage of students who marked ""totally disagree"" or ""disagree"" for the statement of ""I was satisfied with the theoretical education in DAE"" was 58.6%, but when it came to practical education the percentage raised to 79.9%. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results the efficiency of DAE, especially in terms of practice lessons, was found to be lower than TAE. To make DAE a powerful alternative to TAE, future studies should aim to develop a new syllabus for DAE.","Ortadeveci, Abdullah; Ermez, Merve Nur; Oz, Semih; Ozden, Hilmi",,,427

486219,Editorial: Revisiting ‘global impact’ and global social governance while worrying about WHO and other global actors struggling with COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in NHS surgical service provision, including reduced elective surgical and endoscopic activity, with only essential emergency surgery being undertaken. This, combined with the government-imposed lockdown, may have impacted on patient attendance, severity of surgical disease, and outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible 'lockdown' effect on the volume and severity of surgical admissions and their outcomes. METHODS: Two separate cohorts of adult emergency general surgery inpatient admissions 30 days immediately before (February 16, 2020 to March 15, 2020), and after UK government advice (March 16, 2020 to April 15, 2020). Data were collected relating to patient characteristics, severity of disease, clinical outcomes, and compared between these groups. RESULTS: Following lockdown, a significant reduction in median daily admissions from 7 to 3 per day (pâ¯<â¯0.001) was observed. Post-lockdown patients were significantly older, frailer with higher inflammatory indices and rates of acute kidney injury, and also were significantly more likely to present with gastrointestinal cancer, obstruction, and perforation. Patients had significantly higher rates of Clavien-Dindo Grade &#8805;3 complications (pâ¯=â¯0.001), all cause 30-day mortality (8.5% vs. 2.9%, pâ¯=â¯0.028), but no significant difference was observed in operative 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: There appears to be a ""lockdown"" effect on general surgical admissions with a profound impact; fewer surgical admissions, more acutely unwell surgical patients, and an increase in all cause 30-day mortality. Patients should be advised to present promptly with gastrointestinal symptoms, and this should be reinforced for future lockdowns during the pandemic.","McLean, Ross C; Young, John; Musbahi, Aya; Lee, Jing Xian; Hidayat, Hena; Abdalla, Nagi; Chowdhury, Sabyasachi; Baker, Elizabeth A; Etherson, Kevin Jon",Int J Surg,,427

This class of drugs has been found to be truly life-changing for many, though they are not without potential adverse effects. While JAK inhibitors have not been shown to significantly increase the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in large scale clinical trials, NMSC is one of the most concerning possible adverse events, and there have been several reported cases of aggressive squamous cell carcinomas, especially in our already immunosuppressed patient populations. In these patients, it is incredibly important that patients are on the lowest possible dosage of the JAK inhibitor. In addition, these patients must be routinely screened by a dermatologist with a comprehensive skin exam to ensure early detection if skin cancer was to develop. For those patients diagnosed with skin cancer, early intervention is key to optimize outcomes, and at times, multi-disciplinary care coordination is needed. In the future, large-scale studies with longer follow-up of patients would help determine whether JAK inhibitors significantly increase the risk of NMSC.","Greif, Charlotte S; Srivastava, Divya; Nijhawan, Rajiv I",Curr Treat Options Oncol,,427

Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), which is used effectively for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infections, was applied for COVID-19 treatment given similarities in the molecular structures of these viruses. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir antiviral treatment in patients with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. After registration with INPLASY, a search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Cochrane Library, WanFang Data, China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) and other databases for all relevant literature on lopinavir/ritonavir treatment of SARS, MERS and COVID-19. The Cochrane Collaboration's bias risk assessment tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) were used to evaluate the quality of the literature, and RevMan 5.3 software was used to evaluate the relevant outcome indicators of the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of COVID-19. A total of 18 eligible studies (including randomized controlled studies, cohort studies, and case-control studies) were retrieved and included with a total of 2273 patients. The lopinavir/ritonavir group exhibited an increased nucleic acid conversion rate (P=0.004), higher virus clearance rate (P<0.0001), lower mortality rate (P=0.002), and reduced incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (P=0.02) compared with the control group. No significant benefit in the improvement rate of chest CT (P=0.08) or incidence of adverse events (P=0.45) was noted. The lopinavir/ritonavir group had a lower incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (P=0.02). According to the clinical prognostic results, the incidence of adverse events between the two groups was not statistically significant (P<0.0001). The efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of patients with SARS, MERS and COVID-19 was significantly better than that of the control. Furthermore, the incidence of adverse events did not significantly increase. Lopinavir/ritonavir is effective in the treatment of COVID-19, and this combination should be further assessed in RCT studies. In addition, when we analyzed the differences in age and sex, we found that the differences were statistically significant in the safety and effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir in patients with COVID-19, and both of these factors played a significant role in the trial.","Wu, Liusheng; Zheng, Yuzhen; Liu, Jixian; Luo, Ruixing; Wu, Dingwang; Xu, Pengcheng; Wu, Da; Li, Xiaoqiang",Aging (Albany NY),,427

488702,Rapid Artificial Intelligence Solutions in a Pandemic - The COVID-19-20 Lung CT Lesion Segmentation Challenge,2021,"Learning and education are two of the biggest world issues of the current pandemic. Unfortunately, it is seen in this work that, due to the length of the incubation period of Covid-19, full opening of schools in the Fall of 2020 seems to be impractical unless the spread of the virus is completely under control in the surrounding region (e.g. with fewer than 5 active cases every million people). In order to support the possibility of some in-person learning, we model the diffusion of the epidemic within each single school by a SEAIR model with an external source of infection and a suitable loss function, and then evaluate sustainable opening plans. It turns out that blended models, with almost periodic alternations of in-class and remote teaching days or weeks, are generally (close to) optimal. In a prototypical example, the optimal strategy prescribes a school opening of 90 days out of 200 with the number of Covid-19 cases among the individuals related to the school increasing by about 71%, instead of the about 390% increase that would have been a consequence of full opening. As clinical fraction is low in children, these solutions could lead to very few or no symptomatic cases within the school during the whole school year. Using the density of active cases as a proxy for the number of pre- and asymptomatic, we get an indication for each country of whether either full opening, or blended opening with frequent testing, or no school opening at all, are advisable.","Gandolfi, Alberto",Physica D,,427

New York City (NYC) represents a unique opportunity to examine the epidemiologic association between the two given the variable regional distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in its highly diverse neighborhoods. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden during the first COVID-19 pandemic across the highly diverse neighborhoods of NYC. METHODS: The incidences of OHSD between March 20 and April 22, 2019, and between March 20 and April 22, 2020, as reported by the Fire Department of New York were obtained. As a surrogate for viral epidemiologic burden, we used percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests performed between March 3 and August 20, 2020. Data were reported separately for the 176 zip codes of NYC. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were performed between the 2 measures to examine association. RESULTS: Incidence of OHSD per 10,000 inhabitants and percentage of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion were highly variable across NYC neighborhoods, varying from 0.0 to 22.9 and 12.4% to 50.9%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed a moderate positive correlation between neighborhood data on OHSD and percentage of positive antibody tests to SARS-CoV-2 (Spearman &#961; 0.506; P <.001). Regression analysis showed that seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 and OHSD in 2019 were independent predictors for OHSD during the first epidemic surge in NYC (R2 = 0.645). CONCLUSION: The association in geographic distribution between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden suggests either a causality between the 2 syndromes or the presence of local determinants affecting both measures in a similar fashion.","Coleman, Kristie M; Saleh, Moussa; Mountantonakis, Stavros E",Heart Rhythm,,427

To aid in alleviating that demand, a survey of commercially available filter media was conducted to determine whether any could serve as a substitute for an N95 FFR while held in a 3D-printed mask (Stopgap Surgical Face Mask from the NIH 3D Print Exchange). Fourteen filter media types and eight combinations were evaluated for filtration efficiency, breathing resistance (pressure drop), and liquid penetration. Additional testing was conducted to evaluate two filter media disinfection methods in the event that the filters were reused in a hospital setting. Efficiency testing was conducted in accordance with the procedures established for approving an N95 FFR. One apparatus used a filter-holding device and another apparatus employed a manikin head to which the 3D-printed mask could be sealed. The filter media and combinations exhibited collection efficiencies varied between 3.9% and 98.8% when tested with a face velocity comparable to that of a standard N95 FFR at the 85 L min-1 used in the approval procedure. Breathing resistance varied between 10.8 to >637 Pa (1.1 to > 65 mm H2O). When applied to the 3D-printed mask efficiency decreased by an average of 13% and breathing resistance increased 4-fold as a result of the smaller surface area of the filter media when held in that mask compared to that of an N95 FFR. Disinfection by dry heat, even after 25 cycles, did not significantly affect filter efficiency and reduced viral infectivity by > 99.9%. However, 10 cycles of 59% vaporized H2O2 significantly (p < 0.001) reduced filter efficiency of the media tested. Several commercially available filter media were found to be potential replacements for the media used to construct the typical cup-like N95 FFR. However, their use in the 3D-printed mask demonstrated reduced efficiency and increased breathing resistance at 85 L min-1.","O039,; Shaughnessy, Patrick T; Strzelecki, Brian; Ortiz-Hernandez, Monica; Aubin, Patrick; Jing, Xuefang; Chang, Qing; Xiang, Jinhua; Thorne, Peter S; Stapleton, Jack T",J Occup Environ Hyg,,427
490062,Withdrawal,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019, causing a respiratory disease (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) of varying severity in Wuhan, China, and subsequently leading to a pandemic. The transmissibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 remain poorly understood. We evaluate its tissue and cellular tropism in human respiratory tract, conjunctiva, and innate immune responses in comparison with other coronavirus and influenza virus to provide insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis. METHODS: We isolated SARS-CoV-2 from a patient with confirmed COVID-19, and compared virus tropism and replication competence with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 (H1N1pdm) in ex-vivo cultures of human bronchus (n=5) and lung (n=4). We assessed extrapulmonary infection using ex-vivo cultures of human conjunctiva (n=3) and in-vitro cultures of human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines. Innate immune responses and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression were investigated in human alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. In-vitro studies included the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus (H5N1) and mock-infected cells as controls. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 infected ciliated, mucus-secreting, and club cells of bronchial epithelium, type 1 pneumocytes in the lung, and the conjunctival mucosa. In the bronchus, SARS-CoV-2 replication competence was similar to MERS-CoV, and higher than SARS-CoV, but lower than H1N1pdm. In the lung, SARS-CoV-2 replication was similar to SARS-CoV and H1N1pdm, but was lower than MERS-CoV. In conjunctiva, SARS-CoV-2 replication was greater than SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 was a less potent inducer of proinflammatory cytokines than H5N1, H1N1pdm, or MERS-CoV. INTERPRETATION: The conjunctival epithelium and conducting airways appear to be potential portals of infection for SARS-CoV-2.

Also, the environmental and social impacts of PSCs are undeniable due to the daily entrance of a large amount of pharmaceutical waste into the environment. However, studies on closed-loop PSCs (CLPSC) are rarely considered real-world requirements such as competition among diverse brands of manufacturers, the dependency of customers' demand on products' price and quality, and diverse reverse flows of end-of-life medicines. In this study, a scenario-based Multi-Objective Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model is developed to design a sustainable CLPSC, which investigates the reverse flows of expired medicines as three classes (must be disposed of, can be remanufactured and can be recycled). To study the competitive market and deal with demand uncertainty, a novel scenario-based game theory model is proposed. The demand function for each brand depends on the price and quality provided. Then, a hybrid solution approach is provided by combining the LP-metrics method with a heuristic algorithm. Furthermore, a real case study is investigated to evaluate the application of the model. Finally, sensitivity analysis and managerial insights are provided. The numerical results show that the proposed classification of reverse flows leads to proper waste management, making money, and reducing both disposal costs and raw material usage. Moreover, competition increases PSCs performance and improves the supply of products to pharmacies.

Rapid transmission and high mortality rates, as well as prolonged and asymptomatic communal periods, are the most important reasons for the global panic due to coronavirus. Since coronavirus treatment and specific vaccines are not yet available, early detection of the virus is critical. A rapid and accurate diagnosis can play a crucial role in the treatment and control of the COVID 19 disease. Serological, ELISA, and molecular-based tests, including PCR and RT-PCR, are among the most important routine methods for detecting coronaviruses. False-positive/negative results, low sensitivity and specificity, and the need for advanced equipment are among the disadvantages and problems of routine methods. To eliminate the drawbacks of routine methods, new technologies are being developed. Biosensors are one of the most important ones.

494387,The Risk of Being a Fallen Angel and the Corporate Dash for Cash in the Midst of COVID,2020,"BACKGROUND: On January 21, 2020, the World Health Organization reported the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which rapidly evolved to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, the virus has also rapidly spread among Latin American, Caribbean, and African countries. OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study is to identify new emerging COVID-19 clusters over time and space (from January 21 to mid-May 2020) in Latin American, Caribbean, and African regions, using a prospective space-time scan measurement approach. The second aim is to assess the impact of real-time population mobility patterns between January 21 and May 18, 2020, under the implemented government interventions, measurements, and policy restrictions on COVID-19 spread among those regions and worldwide. METHODS: We created a global COVID-19 database, of 218 countries and territories, merging the World Health Organization daily case reports with other measures such as population density and country income levels for January 21 to May 18, 2020. A score of government policy interventions was created for low, intermediate, high, and very high interventions. The population's mobility patterns at the country level were obtained from Google community mobility reports. The prospective space-time scan statistic method was applied in five time periods between January and May 2020, and a regression mixed model analysis was used. RESULTS: We found that COVID-19 emerging clusters within these five periods of time increased from 7 emerging clusters to 28 by mid-May 2020. We also detected various increasing and decreasing relative risk estimates of COVID-19 spread among Latin American, Caribbean, and African countries within the period of analysis. Globally, population mobility to parks and similar leisure areas during at least a minimum of implemented intermediate-level control policies (when compared to low-level control policies) was related to accelerated COVID-19 spread. Results were almost consistent when regional stratified analysis was applied. In addition, worldwide population mobility due to working during high implemented control policies and very high implemented control policies, when compared to low-level control policies, was related to positive COVID-19 spread. CONCLUSIONS: The prospective space-time scan is an approach that low-income and middle-income countries could use to detect emerging clusters in a timely manner and implement specific control policies and interventions to slow down COVID-19 transmission. In addition, real-time population mobility obtained from crowdsourced digital data could be useful for current and future targeted public health and mitigation policies at a global and regional level.","Tyrovolas, Stefanos; Giné-Vázquez, Iago; Fernández, Daniel; Morena, Marianthi; Koyanagi, Ai; Janko, Mark; Haro, Josep Maria; Lin, Yang; Lee, Paul; Pan, William; Panagiotakos, Demosthenes; Molassiotis, Alex",J Med Internet Res,,427

However, it is easy to confuse COVID-19 with seasonal influenza in preliminary clinical diagnosis. In this study, the differences between influenza and COVID-19 in epidemiological features, clinical manifestations, comorbidities and pathogen biology were comprehensively compared and analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 causes a higher proportion of pneumonia (90.67 vs. 17.07%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (12.00 vs. 0%) than influenza A virus. The proportion of leukopenia for influenza patients was 31.71% compared with 12.00% for COVID-19 patients (P = 0.0096). The creatinine and creatine kinase were significantly elevated when there were COVID-19 patients. The basic reproductive number (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 is 2.38 compared with 1.28 for seasonal influenza A virus. The mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 1.12 × 10-3 to 6.25 × 10-3, while seasonal influenza virus has a lower evolutionary rate (0.60-2.00 × 10-6). Overall, this study compared the clinical features and outcomes of medically attended COVID-19 and influenza patients. In addition, the S477N and N439K mutations on spike may affect the affinity with receptor ACE2.

Thus, accurate short-term forecasting of the number of new contaminated and recovered cases is crucial for optimizing the available resources and arresting or slowing down the progression of such diseases. Recently, deep learning models demonstrated important improvements when handling time-series data in different applications. This paper presents a comparative study of five deep learning methods to forecast the number of new cases and recovered cases. Specifically, simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated recurrent units (GRUs) and Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) algorithms have been applied for global forecasting of COVID-19 cases based on a small volume of data. This study is based on daily confirmed and recovered cases collected from six countries namely Italy, Spain, France, China, USA, and Australia. Results demonstrate the promising potential of the deep learning model in forecasting COVID-19 cases and highlight the superior performance of the VAE compared to the other algorithms.","Zeroual, Abdelhafid; Harrou, Fouzi; Dairi, Abdelkader; Sun, Ying",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,427

501370,As far apart as earth and sky: a survey of Chinese and Cambodian construction workers in Sihanoukville,2020,"BACKGROUND: In February 2020 Germany was also hit by the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic. Even patients infected by SARS-CoV­2 or COVID-19 may need operative procedures. Currently, no uniform recommendations exist on precautions to be taken when operating on these patients. Furthermore, they may differ from one hospital to another. METHODS: The task force COVID-19 of the emergency, intensive and severely injured section of the German Trauma Society (DGU e.â¯V.) has developed consensus-based recommendations on surgical treatment of patients with SARS-CoV­2 infections. Great importance is placed on the implementation in hospitals at all levels of care. RESULTS: The indications for surgical interventions in patients with COVID-19 infections require an extremely critical evaluation. When indicated these surgical intervention should ideally be performed in a separate operating theater. All personnel involved should wear personal protective equipment with FFP2 masks, face shields and double gloves. The emergency team in the resuscitation bay should generally wear the same personal protective equipment. Special training is mandatory and the exposure of team members should be minimized. CONCLUSION: The recommendations are principally used for all kinds of surgery and comply with the currently available knowledge. Nevertheless, all recommendations represent a compromise between maximum safety of all medical staff and practicability in the routine hospital workflow.","Mahlke, Lutz; Flohé, Sascha; Matthes, Gerrit; Paffrath, Thomas; Wagner, Frithjof; Wölfl, Christoph",Unfallchirurg,,427
502035,Information literacy education during the pandemic: The cases of academic libraries in Chinese top universities,2021,"Based on a simple analysis of the reports of Sant\'e Public France, we show that the real incidence during the second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak is around 60% of the mean positivity of virological tests realized week after week in France. The fraction of the French population infected at the beginning of September is about 3% (2 million people). Both intensive care units (ICU) admission and death rate, which dropped by more than one order of magnitude since March, are currently 0.017% and 0.015% respectively. Simulations of the outbreak evolution based on the hypothesis of negligible reinfection probability are performed for France, Ile de France, Puy de Dome and Bouches du Rhone. The incidence peak of 3.5 % is expected at week 39 for France. These values are 4.5 % at week 37 for Ile de France (for which the peak already passed), 4.2 % at weeks 41-42 for Puy de Dome, 7% at week 38 for Bouches du Rhone. The calculated total number of ICU admission and deaths during the second wave are both found around 3000. The cumulative incidence over the two waves is computed close to 50 % for France and 80 % for Ile de France. We conclude that Covid-19 is much more spread than previously thought, but its severity became very limited since the end of the first wave. The level of spreading raises doubts in the large-scale testing strategy which anyway detects only a few percents of infected people. It also raises doubts in the efficiency of the closing of school classes, where a pupil is tested Covid-positive by chance. Finally, determining the probability of reinfection by making a large-scale testing of persons already found positive several months ago would strongly help to get a better visibility of the future outbreak trajectory.","Malpuech, Guillaume",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05749v1.pdf,427

Forty-seven Wistar rats were submitted to hepatic duct obstruction (OB group) for thirty days without ligature, section or cannulization causing interruption of biliary flow. This technique was carried out by simple traction of the bile duct passing it through the xiphoid appendix. Nine rats were submitted to a sham operation for bile duct stricture and seven rats comprised the control group. Blood samples were collected for the measurement of total bilirubin (TB), alkaline phosphatase (AP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Liver fragments were removed for morphological study. Thirty days after surgery TB, AP, ALT and AST levels were significantly increased in the hepatic duct ligation group compared to the sham operated group and the presence of SBF in the OB group was confirmed by morphological study of the liver. There was technical failure in 31.92% cases. The survival was 100% at fifteen days and 82.97% at the end of the experiment. We concluded that this simple surgical technique may be used to study the consequence of bile duct obstruction which could be a reversible process depending on the obstruction time. This technique can be carried out from cholestasis to fibrosis.","De Lourdes Jorge, Gracinda; Sergio Leonardi, Luiz; de Fatima Santana Ferreira Boin, Ilka; de Castro e Silva Jr, Orlando; Amelia Fazzio Escanhoela, Cecilia",Acta cir. bras.,,427

And what of Freud? What was lost in his inability to court “Blackness”?

503406,Development Factors of Region’s Foreign Economic Activity in the Context of Global Challenges,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The SARS-Cov2 virus is protean in its manifestations, affecting nearly every organ system. However, nervous system involvement and its impact on disease outcome are poorly characterized. The objective of the study is to determine if neurological syndromes are associated with increased risk of inpatient mortality. METHODS: 581 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-Cov2 infection, neurological involvement and brain-imaging were compared to hospitalized non-neurological COVID-19 patients. Four patterns of neurological manifestations were identified -acute stroke, new or recrudescent seizures, altered mentation with normal imaging, and neuro-COVID-19 complex. Factors present on admission were analyzed as potential predictors of in-hospital mortality, including sociodemographic variables, pre-existing comorbidities, vital-signs, laboratory values, and pattern of neurological manifestations. Significant predictors were incorporated into a disease-severity score. Patients with neurological manifestations were matched with patients of the same age and disease severity to assess the risk of death. RESULTS: 4711 patients with confirmed SARS-Cov2 infection were admitted to one medical system in New York City during a 6-week period. Of these, 581 (12%) had neurological issues of sufficient concern to warrant neuro-imaging. These patients were compared to 1743 non-neurological COVID-19 patients matched for age and disease-severity admitted during the same period. Patients with altered mentation (n=258, p =0.04, OR 1.39, CI 1.04 - 1.86) or radiologically confirmed stroke (n=55, p = 0.001, OR 3.1, CI 1.65-5.92) had a higher risk of mortality than age and severity-matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of altered mentation or stroke on admission predicts a modest but significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality independent of disease severity. While other biomarker factors also predict mortality, measures to identify and treat such patients may be important in reducing overall mortality of COVID-19.","Eskandar, Emad Nader; Altschul, David J; de La Garza Ramos, Rafael; Cezayirli, Phillip; Unda, Santiago R; Benton, Joshua; Dardick, Joseph; Toma, Aureliana; Patel, Nikunj; Malaviya, Avinash; Flomenbaum, David; Fernandez-Torres, Jenelys; Lu, Jenny; Holland, Ryan; Burchi, Elisabetta; Zampolin, Richard; Hsu, Kevin; McClelland, Andrew; Burns, Judah; Erdfarb, Amichai; Malhotra, Rishi; Gong, Michelle; Semczuk, Peter; Ferastraoaru, Victor; Rosengard, Jillian; Antoniello, Daniel; Labovitz, Daniel; Esenwa, Charles; Milstein, Mark; Boro, Alexis; Mehler, Mark F",Neurology,,427
503831,The Critical Business School and the University: A Case Study of Resistance and Co-optation,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To report on efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy in a case series of patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on all patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at two Italian hospitals who developed encephalopathy during disease course and were treated with IVIg. RESULTS: Five patients (two females, mean age 66.8 years) developed encephalopathy after a mean of 12.6 days, since the onset of respiratory/constitutional symptoms related to COVID-19. Four patients suffered severe respiratory distress, three of which required invasive mechanical ventilation. Neurological manifestations included impaired consciousness, agitation, delirium, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. EEG demonstrated diffuse slowing in all patients. Brain MRI showed non-specific findings. CSF analysis revealed normal cell count and protein levels. In all subjects, RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF tested negative. IVIg at 0.4 g/kg/die was commenced 29.8 days (mean, range: 19-55 days) after encephalopathy onset, leading to complete electroclinical recovery in all patients, with an initial improvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in 3.4 days (mean, range: 1-10 days). No adverse events related to IVIg were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that IVIg may represent a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19-associated encephalopathy. Clinical efficacy may be driven by the anti-inflammatory action of IVIg, associated with its anti-cytokine qualities.","Muccioli, Lorenzo; Pensato, Umberto; Bernabè, Giorgia; Ferri, Lorenzo; Tappatà, Maria; Volpi, Lilia; Cani, Ilaria; Henry, Olivia J; Ceccaroni, Francesca; Cevoli, Sabina; Stofella, Gloria; Pasini, Elena; Fornaro, Giacomo; Tonon, Caterina; Vidale, Simone; Liguori, Rocco; Tinuper, Paolo; Michelucci, Roberto; Cortelli, Pietro; Bisulli, Francesca",J. neurol,,427
504003,Application Of Seir Model In COVID-19 And The Effect Of Lockdown On Reducing The Number Of Active Cases,2020,"BACKGROUND: The early days of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States brought uncertainty in the knowledge about COVID-19 and what to do about it. It is necessary to understand public knowledge and behaviors if we are to effectively address the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that knowledge about COVID-19 influences participation in different behaviors including self-reports of purchasing more goods than usual, attending large gatherings, and using medical masks. METHODS: This study was funded and approved by the Institutional Review Board on March 17, 2020. The cross-sectional online survey of 1034 US residents aged 18 years or older was conducted on March 17, 2020. RESULTS: For every point increase in knowledge, the odds of participation in purchasing more goods (odds ratio [OR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.95), attending large gatherings (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.93), and using medical masks (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.50-0.62) decreased by 12%, 13%, and 44%, respectively. Gen X and millennial participants had 56% and 76% higher odds, respectively, of increased purchasing behavior compared to baby boomers. The results suggest that there is a politicization of response recommendations. Democrats had 30% lower odds of attending large gatherings (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50-0.97) and 48% lower odds of using medical masks (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34-0.78) compared to Republicans. CONCLUSIONS: This survey is one of the first attempts to study determinants of knowledge and behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. A national, coordinated effort toward a pandemic response may ensure better compliance with behavioral recommendations to address this public health emergency.","Clements, John M",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,427

Asthma is a common chronic medical condition in children that is uniquely susceptible to changes brought on by COVID-19. Sudden dramatic changes in the environment, medical practice, and medication use have altered the asthma management landscape with potential impacts on asthma outcomes. In this paper, we review how changes in transportation and travel patterns, school attendance, physical activity, and time spent indoors, along with changes in health care delivery since the start of the pandemic, all play a contributing role in asthma control in children. We review potentially important influences of asthma control in children during the COVID-19 pandemic worthy of further study.","Oreskovic, Nicolas M; Kinane, T Bernard; Aryee, Emmanuel; Kuhlthau, Karen A; Perrin, James M",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,,427

SARS-CoV-2 infection can stimulate a pronounced immune response in the host, which embodies in the decrease of lymphocytes and aberrant increase of cytokines in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and proteins interact with various pattern recognition receptors that switch on antiviral immune responses to regulate viral replication and spreading within the host in vivo. However, overactive and impaired immune responses also cause immune damage and subsequent tissue inflammation. This article focuses on the dual roles of immune system during SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing a theoretical basic for identifying therapeutic targets in a situation with an unfavourable immune reaction.","Li, Keying; Hao, Zhenhua; Zhao, Xiaohui; Du, Jiying; Zhou, Yanlin",Scand J Immunol,,427

505128,What future/s for outdoor and environmental education in a world that has contended with COVID-19?,2020,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a new disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was occurred. Patients who are critically ill with COVID-19 are more likely to die, especially elderly patients. We aimed to describe the effect of age on the clinical and immune characteristics of critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively included 32 patients with COVID-19 who were confirmed to have COVID-19 by the local health authority and who were admitted to the first affiliated hospital of Zhengzhou University in Zhengzhou, China between January 3 and March 20, 2020. Clinical information and experimental test data were retrospectively collected for the patients. The 32 patients in this study were all in a critical condition and were classified as severe, according to the guidelines of 2019-nCoV infection from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Data were compared between those <60 years old and &#8805;60 years old. RESULTS: Of 32 patients, 13 were under 60 years old, and 19 patients were &#8805;60 years old. The most common symptom among all patients upon admission was fever (93.8%, 30/32). Compared to younger patients, older patients exhibited increased comorbidities. Among patients who were 60 years and older, platelet count, direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin(IBIL), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were significantly higher than in younger patients who were less than 60 years old. CD4+ T lymphocytes, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and NKT lymphocytes were decreased, CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocytes were significantly increased in all 32 patients, while there were no evident differences between younger and older patients. The CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory, rate, blood pressure plus age &#8805;65 years), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and pH value were significantly higher in older patients than in patients who were under 60 years old. However, the PaO2 and PaO2:FiO2 were lower in older patients than the younger. Compared to patients under 60 years old, patients who were 60 years and older tended to develop ARDS (15 [78.9%] vs 5 [38.5%]), septic shock (7 [36.8%] vs 0 [0.0%]) and were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (13 [68.4%] vs 3[23.1%]). Dynamic trajectories of seven laboratory parameters were tracked on days 1, 3, 5 and 7, and significant differences in lymphocyte count (P = 0.026), D-dimer (P = 0.010), lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.000) and C-reactive protein (P = 0.000) were observed between the two age groups. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of critically ill patients were 60 or older. Furthermore, rapid disease progression was noted in elderly patients. Therefore, close monitoring and timely treatment should be performed in elderly COVID-19 patients.","Hu, Chunling; Li, Junlu; Xing, Xia; Gao, Jing; Zhao, Shilong; Xing, Lihua",PLoS One,,427

506027,Outsized Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic on Minority Communities,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to the cancellation of non-essential surgical procedures in March 2020. With the resumption of surgical activity, patients undergoing surgery were one of the first population groups to be systematically tested for PCR. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers after the resumption of non-essential surgical activity. METHODS: Retrospective multicenter observational study of patients scheduled for surgery or undergoing emergency surgery in Catalonia between 20 April and 31 May 2020. The microbiological results of preoperative PCR tests and clinical records were reviewed, and an epidemiological survey was conducted on patients with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 10,838 patients scheduled for surgery or who underwent emergency surgery were screened for COVID-19. One hundred and eighteen patients (1.09%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the 72hours prior to surgery. The prevalence of asymptomatic carriers was 0.7% (95%CI: 0.6% - 0.9%). The first week of the study presented the highest prevalence of asymptomatic carriers [1.9% (95%CI: 1.1%-3.2%)]. CONCLUSIONS: The low levels of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 infection obtained in the surgical population of hospitals in Catalonia after the resumption of surgical activity, shows that most patients were able to undergo surgical procedures without the risks of COVID-19 associated complications in the perioperative period.","de Miguel Negro, Marcos; González Tallada, Anna; de Nadal, Miriam; Biarnes Suñé, Alfons; Manrique Muñoz, Susana; Campins Martí, Magda; Álvarez Pérez, Astrid; Castellnou Ferré, Jordi; Pedregosa Sanz, Ana; Rouras Hurtado, Gal la; Martínez Cabañero, Javier; Osorio Salazar, Esteban; Montero Matamala, Antonio; Saludes, Judit; Binagui Buitureira, Alessandra Verónica; Farré Tebar, Carla; Baumgartner Lucero, Maria Laura; Cadena Serramitja, Montserrat; Lacambra Basil, Marta; Faura, Ana; Ibáñez Trujillo, Néstor Fabián; Delgado García, Rocío; Santiveri Papiol, Francisco Javier; Escolano Villén, Fernando; Tejedor Navarro, Ana; Deiros García, Carme; Remartínez Fernández, Fernando; Tobito Ramírez, Javier; Moret Ferrón, María Lluisa; Salmerón Zafra, Óscar; Isern Domingo, Xènia; Villalba Blanco, Naiara",Cir.

506937,uTakeCare,2021,"BACKGROUND: Foot health problems are common in the general population, and particularly so in people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders (RMD). Several clinical guidelines state that people with RMDs should have access to foot health services, although service capacity is often limited. The current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for alternative ways to provide patient care. The aim of this clinical audit was to review a newly implemented telephone follow-up appointment service conducted within the Rheumatology Podiatry Department in Leeds, UK. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients attending the Rheumatology Podiatry Department at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust were contacted by telephone approximately 6-8 weeks following initial intervention. During the telephone consultation, all patients were asked pre-defined questions relating to their symptoms, intervention efficacy, the need for further appointments and their preference for the type of consultation. To assess the cost of the telephone consultation the number of attempts needed in order to make successful contact, the duration of the call and the number of telephone follow-up appointments completed in a working day were also recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (43%) were successfully contacted within the 6-8 weeks stipulated time frame and were included in the analysis. Of the 25 contacted, twelve (48%) patients were successfully contacted on the first attempt. Ten (40%) were successfully contacted on the second attempt. The remaining three patients (12%) required 3 or more attempts to make successful contact. Telephone consultations were estimated not to last longer than 10 min, including notes screening and documentation. Eleven patients (44%) reported an improvement in their symptoms, thirteen (52%) reported no change and one patient (4%) reported their symptoms to be worse. CONCLUSION: Telephone follow-up consultations may be a potentially cost-effective alternative to face-to-face appointments when implemented in a Rheumatology Podiatry Department, and provide an alternative way of providing care, especially when capacity for face-to-face contact is limited. The potential cost saving and efficiency benefits of this service are likely to be enhanced when telephone consultations are pre-arranged with patients.","Palmer, J L; Siddle, H J; Redmond, A C; Alcacer-Pitarch, B",J Foot Ankle Res,,427

507305,Review of Doug Selwyn (2019). All children are our children,2020,"The implementation of governmental Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) has been the primary means of controlling the spread of the COVID-19 disease. The intended effect of these NPIs has been to reduce mobility. A strong reduction in mobility is believed to have a positive effect on the reduction of COVID-19 transmission by limiting the opportunity for the virus to spread in the population. Due to the huge costs of implementing these NPIs, it is essential to have a good understanding of their efficacy. Using global mobility data, released by Apple and Google, and ACAPS NPI data, we have investigated the proportional contribution of NPIs on i) the size of the change (magnitude) of transition between pre- and post-lockdown mobility levels and ii) the rate (gradient) of this transition. Using generalized linear models to find the best fit model, we found similar results using Apple or Google data. NPIs found to have impacted the magnitude of the change in mobility were: lockdown measures (Apple, Google Retail and Recreation (RAR) and Google Transit and Stations (TS));declaring a state of emergency (Apple, Google RAR and Google TS);closure of businesses and public services (Google RAR) and school closures (Apple). Using cluster analyses and chi square tests, we found that closure of businesses and public services, school closures and limiting public gatherings, as well as border closures and international flight suspensions, were closely related. The implementation of lockdown measures and limiting public gatherings have had the greatest effect on the rate of mobility change. In conclusion, we were able to quantitatively assess the efficacy of NPIs in reducing mobility, which have enabled us to understand their fine grained effects in a timely manner, thereby facilitating well-informed and cost-effective interventions.","Snoeijer, Berber T.; Burger, Mariska Sun Shaoxiong Dobson Richard J.

Both drugs may increase risk of lethal arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation. Methods and Results We analyzed a case series of COVID-19-positive/suspected patients admitted between February 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, or a combination of both drugs. We evaluated baseline and postmedication QT interval (corrected QT interval [QTc]; Bazett) using 12-lead ECGs. Critical QTc prolongation was defined as follows: (1) maximum QTc &#8805;500 ms (if QRS <120 ms) or QTc &#8805;550 ms (if QRS &#8805;120 ms) and (2) QTc increase of &#8805;60 ms. Tisdale score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated. Of 490 COVID-19-positive/suspected patients, 314 (64%) received either/both drugs and 98 (73 COVID-19 positive and 25 suspected) met study criteria (age, 62±17 years; 61% men). Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and both in 62%. Baseline mean QTc was 448±29 ms and increased to 459±36 ms (P=0.005) with medications. Significant prolongation was observed only in men (18±43 ms versus -0.2±28 ms in women; P=0.02). A total of 12% of patients reached critical QTc prolongation. Changes in QTc were highest with the combination compared with either drug, with much greater prolongation with combination versus azithromycin (17±39 ms versus 0.5±40 ms; P=0.07). No patients manifested torsades de pointes. Conclusions Overall, 12% of patients manifested critical QTc prolongation, and the combination caused greater prolongation than either drug alone. The balance between uncertain benefit and potential risk when treating COVID-19 patients should be carefully assessed.","Ramireddy, Archana; Chugh, Harpriya; Reinier, Kyndaron; Ebinger, Joseph; Park, Eunice; Thompson, Michael; Cingolani, Eugenio; Cheng, Susan; Marban, Eduardo; Albert, Christine M; Chugh, Sumeet S",J Am Heart Assoc,,427

The results highlight unidirectional causality between economic growth and pollution. Then, a D2C algorithm on proportion-based causality is applied, implementing the Oryx 2.0.8 protocol in Apache. The underlying hypothesis is that a predetermined pollution concentration, caused by economic growth, could foster COVID-19 by making the respiratory system more susceptible to infection. We use data (from January 29 to May 18, 2020) on confirmed deaths (total and daily) and air pollution concentration levels for 25 major Indian cities.

In this case-based review, we aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, imaging findings, and in-hospital course of acute myocarditis. In addition, the limitations of the myocarditis diagnosis were discussed since only fulminant myocarditis cases have been mentioned in the current literature. METHODS We performed a review of the literature of all patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis using the databases of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane. RESULTS 16 case reports were found to be related to COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis. We observed that the ECG findings in most of the COVID-19 patients were non-specific, including diffuse ST-segment elevation, non-specific intraventricular conduction delay, sinus tachycardia, and inverted T-waves in anterior leads. Echocardiographic findings of COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis patients ranged from preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) without segmental abnormalities to reduced LVEF with global hypokinesia. Interestingly, a few patients with COVID-19-induced acute fulminant myocarditis were steroid-responsive and had an amelioration with glucocorticoid and immunoglobulin therapy. CONCLUSION Despite the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, a limited number of cases has been shared in the current literature. There are a lot of difficulties in the differential diagnosis of acute myocarditis in the context of COVID-19.","Çinar, Tufan; Hayiroglu, Mert Ilker; Çiçek, Vedat; Uzun, Mehmet; Orhan, Ahmet Lütfullah",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),,427
510535,Both Rates of Fake News and Fact-based News on Twitter Negatively Correlate with the State-level COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake,2021-06-14,"Myogenesis is a complex, regulated process that involves myoblast proliferation, migration, adhesion, and fusion into myotubes. To investigate early development of embryonic muscles and the expression of regulatory genes during myogenesis in chicken, quail and their hybrids, meat-breeding cocks and egg-breeding cocks were selected as male parents, quails were used as female parents. Their offspring were meat and egg hybrids via Artificial insemination. We measured expression of MUSTN1, IGF-1, and PDK4 using qRT-PCR. We examined muscle fiber diameter using scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that muscle development was two days slower in chicken, egg hybrid, and meat hybrid than in quail. Muscle fiber spacing was the largest in chicken, followed by meat hybrid, egg hybrid, and quail. A similar trend was obtained for muscle fiber diameter. Additionally, muscle fiber diameter increased with embryogenesis. The sarcomere was present on day 17 of incubation in quail, but not in the other species. MUSTN1 could up-regulated IGF-1 by activating PI3K/Akt. IGF-1 expression was consistent with myoblast proliferation and myotube fusion. PDK4 was expressed from E7 to E17. The first peak was reached on E10, egg hybrid and meat hybrid reached their peak at E15. PDK4 is involved in the early proliferation and differentiation of muscle, thereby affecting muscle growth and development. Our findings demonstrated that MUSTN1, IGF-1 and PDK4 genes are expressed to varying levels in breast muscle of chicken, quail, egg hybrid and meat hybrid during the embryonic period. Interestingly, with increasing embryonic age, muscle development was approximately 48 h faster in quail than in other species. We speculated that MUSTN1, IGF-1 and PDK4 genes may be the main candidate genes that cause differences in poultry muscle traits, but the molecular regulation mechanisms need to be further studied. Our findings shed some light on the avian embryo muscle formation and molecular breeding of poultry muscle traits, which provide theoretical basis for poultry breeding.","Zhu, Mengting; Wang, Mingyuan; Shao, Yanyan; Nan, Ying; Blair, Hugh T; Morris, Stephen Todd; Zhao, Zongsheng; Zhang, Hongmei",Gene,,427

We aimed to describe the rate of emergency department visits for acute stroke before and after the declaration of the pandemic, through the different phases of reopening, in the population of Ontario, Canada (14 million people). Methods: Using administrative data linkage, we will show the age- and sex-standardized rate of weekly emergency department visits for ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke between January 1 to September 30, 2020. Pandemic declaration was on March 11, 2020 (week 11) and phase 1 reopening started on May 19, 2020 (week 20) in Ontario. We will use piecewise regression analysis models to evaluate the changes in rates during the pandemic and after reopening. Results: We identified 5,617 emergency department visits for stroke (53% male, median age 74 IQR [63,83]) between January 1 to May 19, 2020 (week 20). Data beyond May 19, 2020 are not available yet, but these will be presented at the ISC 2021. The proportion of patients treated at a comprehensive stroke center was similar pre- and post-pandemic (41.7% versus 42.7%, standard difference (SD) 0.02), as was the proportion of people admitted to hospital (87.9% versus 86.7%, SD 0.03), treated with intravenous thrombolysis (11.6% versus 11.8%, SD 0.01), or underwent endovascular thrombectomy (5.1% versus 4.8%, SD 0.02). Weekly rates of stroke visits decreased after the pandemic declaration, but they seem to increase after week 16 (Figure 1). We show rates from 2019 for comparison. Conclusions: Population-based rates of emergency department visits for stroke initially decreased after the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic rates.

It often involves multiple tensor-compatible datasets with non-linear multi-way relationships, spatiotemporal structures, and different levels of sparsity. Current non-linear tensor completion algorithms tend to learn noisy embedding and incur overfitting. This paper focuses on the embedding learning aspect of the tensor completion problem and proposes a new multi-layer neural network architecture for tensor factorization and completion (MLCTR). The network architecture entails multiple advantages: a series of low-rank matrix factorizations (MF) building blocks to minimize overfitting, interleaved transfer functions in each layer for non-linearity, and by-pass connections to reduce the gradient diminishing problem and increase the depths of neural networks. Furthermore, the model employs Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) based optimization for fast convergence in training. Our algorithm is highly efficient for imputing missing values in the EPS data. Experiments confirm that our strategy of incorporating non-linearity in factor matrices demonstrates impressive performance in embedding learning and end-to-end tensor models, and outperforms approaches with non-linearity in the phase of reconstructing tensors from factor matrices.","Uddin, Ajim; Zhou, Dan; Tao, Xinyuan; Chou, Chia-Ching; Yu, Dantong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01773v1.pdf,427

The nanoprodrug inherits the features of both prodrug concept and nanomedicine know-how, attempts to solve underexploited challenge in cancer treatment cooperatively. Prodrugs can release bioactive drugs on-demand at specific sites to reduce systemic toxicity, this is done by using the special properties of the tumor microenvironment, such as pH value, glutathione concentration, and specific overexpressed enzymes; or by using exogenous stimulation, such as light, heat, and ultrasound. The nanotechnology, manipulating the matter within nanoscale, has high relevance to certain biological conditions, and has been widely utilized in cancer therapy. Together, the marriage of prodrug strategy which shield the side effects of parent drug and nanotechnology with pinpoint delivery capability has conceived highly camouflaged Trojan horse to maneuver cancerous threats.","Zhang, Yuezhou; Cui, Huaguang; Zhang, Ruiqi; Zhang, Hongbo; Huang, Wei",Adv Sci (Weinh),,427
514885,A context-driven approach on coping with COVID-19: From hiding knowledge toward citizen engagement,2021,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is causing a significant health emergency which is overturning dramatically routine activities in hospitals. The outbreak is generating the need to provide assistance to infected patients and in parallel to treat all nondeferrable oncological and urgent benign diseases. A panel of Italian urologists agreed on possible strategies for the reorganization of urological routine practices and on a set of recommendations that should facilitate a further planning of both inpatient visits and surgical activities during the COVID- 19 pandemic. According to this only urgent benign and nondeferrable oncological activities have been kept. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have considered urgent outpatient visits requested by Emergency Department (ED) or by General Practitioner (GP) and emergency surgical procedures performed in our Urology Unit from March 9th to April 14th 2020, during COVID-19 pandemic. These figures have been compared to those observed last year from March 9th to April 14th 2019. RESULTS: Our data show that urgent care visits decreased during COCID-19 pandemic (from 293 to 179). Urgent care visits of patients who accessed directly to the ED decreased (from 219 to 107) whereas the number of urgent care visits referred by GP remained unchanged (74 vs 72). Consequently, the rate of visits from ED decreased from 75% to 60% and the rate of visit requested by GP increased from 25% to 40% (p = 0.001). Particularly, the rate of visits for renal colic, LUTS and other not precisely defined disorders from ED decreased and the corresponding rates of visits of patients referred by GPs increased significantly (p = 0.0001, p = 0.0180 and p = 0.0185, respectively). The rate of visits for acute urinary retention, hematuria, sepsis, acute scrotum, cystitis, prostatitis and genito-urinary trauma from ED and GP remained unchanged. Finally, urgency endourology and surgical activities have been stable in relation to the same period last year. CONCLUSIONS: Urological emergency activities during COVID- 19 pandemic are more appropriate since urgent outpatients' visits required by ED are decreased and emergency surgical and endourological procedures are stable.","Cicerello, Elisa; Mangano, Mario S; Cova, Giandavide; Zordani, Alessio",,,427

A total of 1,680 7th to 12th grade students enrolled at a large middle-high school located in Southwest China completed an online survey measuring mood states, physical activity, screen time, conflicts with parents, and body height and weight. Physical activity, particularly of at least 150 minutes' duration each week, significantly decreased the likelihood of negative mood among adolescents during lockdown. Screen time, specifically other than that spent on online study, had a negative association with mood, after controlling for the relevant variables (i.e., physical activity and body mass index). Less screen time and accumulating 150 minutes of physical activity were associated with fewer conflicts with parents. With the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, local school districts, school leaders, and health professionals should develop greater awareness of potential problems with, and engage parents in developing specific guidance on controlling, screen time and promoting physical activity in a time-sensitive manner.

Non structural protein 1 (nsp1) is found in all beta coronavirus that cause severe respiratory disease. This protein is considered as a virulence factor and has an important role in pathogenesis. This study aims to elucidate the structural conformations of nsp1 to aid in the prediction of epitope sites and identification of important residues for targeted therapy against COVID-19. In this study, molecular modelling coupled with molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyse the conformational landscape of nsp1 homologs of SARS-CoV1, SARS-CoV2 and MERS-CoV. Principal component analysis escorted by free energy landscape revealed that SARS-CoV2 nsp1 protein shows greater flexibility compared to SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV nsp1. Sequence comparison reveals that 28 mutations are present in SARS-CoV2 nsp1 protein compared to SARS-CoV1 nsp1. Several B-cell and T-cell epitopes were identified by an immunoinformatics approach. SARS-CoV2 nsp1 protein binds with the interface region of the palm and finger domain of POLA1 via hydrogen bonding and salt bridge interactions. Taken together, these in silico findings may help in the development of therapeutics specific against COVID-19.","Chaudhuri, Ankur",J Mol Struct,,427

Because the virus testing criteria had changed significantly over this time period, we wanted to ascertain whether previous cases of COVID-19 had been missed in the province. METHODS: Our aim was to retrospectively evaluate specimens submitted for respiratory virus testing from December 1, 2019, through March 7, 2020, for undetected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) infections before the first confirmed case. RESULTS: Testing of 23,517 samples (representing 23,394 patients) identified 1 patient positive for SARS-CoV-2. This specimen was collected on February 24, 2020, from a patient with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 who had recently returned from the western United States. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed this viral isolate belonged to lineage B.1. The epidemiology of this case is consistent with those of other early cases before sustained community transmission, which included a travel history outside of Canada.

Data pertaining to cardiac sequalae is of urgent importance to define subsequent cardiac surveillance. METHODS: We performed a systematic cardiac screening for 97 consecutive COVID-19 survivors including electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, serum troponin and NT-proBNP assay 1-4 weeks after hospital discharge. Treadmill exercise test and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) were performed according to initial screening results. RESULTS: The mean age was 46.5 ± 18.6 years; 53.6% were men. All were classified with non-severe disease without overt cardiac manifestations and did not require intensive care. Median hospitalization stay was 17 days and median duration from discharge to screening was 11 days. Cardiac abnormalities were detected in 42.3% including sinus bradycardia (29.9%), newly detected T-wave abnormality (8.2%), elevated troponin level (6.2%), newly detected atrial fibrillation (1.0%), and newly detected left ventricular systolic dysfunction with elevated NT-proBNP level (1.0%). Significant sinus bradycardia with heart rate below 50 bpm was detected in 7.2% COVID-19 survivors, which appeared to be self-limiting and recovered over time. For COVID-19 survivors with persistent elevation of troponin level after discharge or newly detected T wave abnormality, echocardiography and CMR did not reveal any evidence of infarct, myocarditis, or left ventricular systolic dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Cardiac abnormality is common amongst COVID-survivors with mild disease, which is mostly self-limiting. Nonetheless, cardiac surveillance in form of ECG and/or serum biomarkers may be advisable to detect more severe cardiac involvement including atrial fibrillation and left ventricular dysfunction.","Zhou, Mi; Wong, Chun-Ka; Un, Ka-Chun; Lau, Yuk-Ming; Lee, Jeffrey Chun-Yin; Tam, Frankie Chor-Cheung; Lau, Yee-Man; Lai, Wing-Hon; Tam, Anthony Raymond; Lam, Yat-Yin; Pang, Polly; Tong, Teresa; Tang, Milky; Tse, Hung-Fat; Ho, Deborah; Ng, Ming-Yen; Chan, Esther W; Wong, Ian C K; Lau, Chu-Pak; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Siu, Chung-Wah",PLoS One,,427

The aim was to describe the obstetric-perinatal and neonatal outcome of infected pregnant women and their newborns during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) Methods: Three bibliographical databases were searched (last search: September 10, 2020). Quality assessment was performed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Primary outcomes included mode of delivery, preterm delivery/labor, premature rupture of membranes (PROM/pPROM) and abortions/miscarriages. Outcomes were mainly presented as ranges. A separate analysis, including only moderate and high-quality systematic reviews, was also conducted. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020214447); (3) Results: Thirty-nine reviews were analyzed. Reported rates, regarding both preterm and term gestations, varied between 52.3 and 95.8% for cesarean sections; 4.2-44.7% for vaginal deliveries; 14.3-63.8% specifically for preterm deliveries and 22.7-32.2% for preterm labor; 5.3-12.7% for PROM and 6.4-16.1% for pPROM. Maternal anxiety for potential fetal infection contributed to abortion decisions, while SARS-CoV-2-related miscarriages could not be excluded. Maternal ICU admission and mechanical ventilation rates were 3-28.5% and 1.4-12%, respectively. Maternal mortality rate was <2%, while stillbirth, neonatal ICU admission and mortality rates were <2.5%, 3.1-76.9% and <3%, respectively. Neonatal PCR positivity rates ranged between 1.6% and 10%. After accounting for quality of studies, ranges of our primary outcomes remained almost unchanged, while among our secondary outcomes, maternal ICU admission (3-10%) and mechanical ventilation rates (1.4-5.5%) were found to be relatively lower; (4) Conclusions: Increased rates of cesarean sections and preterm birth rates were found, with iatrogenic reasons potentially involved. In cases of symptomatic women with confirmed infection, high maternal and neonatal ICU admission rates should raise some concerns. The probability of vertical transmission cannot be excluded. Further original studies on women from all trimesters are warranted.","Papapanou, Michail; Papaioannou, Maria; Petta, Aikaterini; Routsi, Eleni; Farmaki, Maria; Vlahos, Nikolaos; Siristatidis, Charalampos",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,427

This study aimed to investigate perceived stress levels due to the COVID-19 outbreak and explore associated factors among students under lockdown. METHODS: Sociodemographic data, living and learning conditions and existing scales of perceived stress (PSS) and social support (MSPSS) were administered to French students via an online survey. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between severe perceived stress and different factors. RESULTS: Among 3764 university students, the average PSS score was 19.2 (SD=8.3), and 22% experienced high perceived stress. The presence of someone hospitalized for COVID-19 in one's household (OR=6, 95% CI: 2.4-14.6) and female gender (OR=2.3, 95% CI: 1.9-2.9) were the main risk factors for severe perceived stress. The following risk factors were also identified: enrollment in the arts, humanities and language program; postponement of a final examination; reduced learning time; conflicts at home and with neighbors; difficulties isolating; noise inside or outside one's home; a lack of direct outdoor access; increased alcohol and tobacco consumption; and the perceived ineffectiveness of the use of media entertainment to calm down. Friend support (OR=0.87, 95% CI: 0.82-0.93) and family support (OR=0.79, 95% CI: 0.74-0.84) and the perceived effectiveness of physical exercise (OR=0.5, 95% CI: 0.4-0.6) for calming down were protective factors.

STUDY DESIGN: mCMV model of infection. SETTING: University of Utah laboratory. METHODS: Three-day-old BALB/c mice were inoculated with mCMV or saline. Five days later, each mouse underwent drilling, microdebrider, coblation, and electrocautery procedures. Particle size distribution and PM2.5 (particulate matter <2.5 µm) concentration were determined with a scanning mobility particle sizer and an aerosol particle sizer in the range of 15 nm to 32 µm. Aerosolized samples from these procedures were collected with an Aerosol Devices BioSpot sampler for viral titer based on polymerase chain reaction and for viable virus through viral culture. RESULTS: As compared with the background aerosol concentrations, coblation and electrocautery showed statistically significant increases in airborne aerosols (Tukey-adjusted P value <.040), while microdebrider and drilling at 30,000 rpm did not (.870 < Tukey-adjusted P value < .930). We identified viral DNA in samples from coblation and drilling procedures, although we did not identify viable viruses in aerosol samples from any of the 4 procedures. CONCLUSION: Coblation and electrocautery procedures generate >100-fold increases in aerosol concentrations over background; only coblation and drilling produce aerosolized viral DNA. The high concentration of aerosols from coblation and electrocautery suggests the need for appropriate safeguards against particle exposure to health care workers. The presence of viral DNA from drilling and coblation procedures warrants the need for appropriate protection against droplet and aerosol exposure.","Sayahi, Tofigh; Nielson, Christopher; Yu, Yuan; Neuberger, Kaden; Seipp, Michael; Firpo, Matthew A; Kelly, Kerry; Park, Albert H",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,427

Cancer Patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated higher rates of severe complications exacerbating towards death. Possible genetic and epigenetic alterations may exist in cancer patients which have the potential to contribute towards their increased vulnerability towards COVID-19. METHOD: An exhaustive literature search using 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Cancer', 'Malignancy', 'Relationships', Interlinks', 'Genetic', 'Epigenetic', 'Epidemiological studies', 'Clinical Studies', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine scenario' were conducted in PubMed and EMBASE till 2nd June 2021. RESULT: In this narrative review, 17 epidemiological studies were listed which focused on clinical parameters of several malignancy patient cohorts who contracted COVID-19. Besides, genetic and epigenetic alterations seen among cancer patients are also discussed which may plausibly increase the vulnerability of cancer patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, global vaccination scenario among malignant patients along with the necessity to prioritize them in the vaccination campaigns are also elaborated. CONCLUSION: Genetic and epigenetic modifications present in ACE2, TMPRSS2, IL-6 and several cytokines require more in-depth research to elucidate the shared mechanisms of malignancy and SARS-CoV-2.","Sayed, Shomoita",Cancer Treat Res Commun,,427
519987,"Comprehensive, resilient disaster and pandemic prevention construction framework for urban underground spaces",2021,"The Influenza virus can be considered as one of the most severe viruses that can infect multiple species with often fatal consequences to the hosts. The Hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the virus can be a target for antiviral drug development realised through accurate identification of its sub-types and possible the targeted hosts. This paper focuses on accurately predicting if an Influenza type A virus can infect specific hosts, and more specifically, Human, Avian and Swine hosts, using only the protein sequence of the HA gene. In more detail, we propose encoding the protein sequences into numerical signals using the Hydrophobicity Index and subsequently utilising a Convolutional Neural Network-based predictive model. The Influenza HA protein sequences used in the proposed work are obtained from the Influenza Research Database (IRD). Specifically, complete and unique HA protein sequences were used for avian, human and swine hosts. The data obtained for this work was 17999 human-host proteins, 17667 avian-host proteins and 9278 swine-host proteins. Given this set of collected proteins, the proposed method yields as much as 10% higher accuracy for an individual class (namely, Avian) and 5% higher overall accuracy than in an earlier study. It is also observed that the accuracy for each class in this work is more balanced than what was presented in this earlier study. As the results show, the proposed model can distinguish HA protein sequences with high accuracy whenever the virus under investigation can infect Human, Avian or Swine hosts.","Chrysostomou, Charalambos; Alexandrou, Floris; Nicolaou, Mihalis A.; Seker, Huseyin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.04240v1.pdf,427

Researchers across the globe has been working in devising the strategies to combat this dreadful disease. Studies focused on genetic variability helps design effective drugs and vaccines. Considering this, the present study entails the information regarding the genome-wide mutations detected in the 108 SARS CoV-2 genomes worldwide. We identified a few hypervariable regions localized in orf1ab, spike, and nucleocapsid gene. These nucleotide polymorphisms demonstrated their effect on both codon usage as well as amino acid usage pattern. Altogether the present study provides valuable information that would be helpful to ongoing research on 2019-nCoV vaccine development.","Gupta, Suruchi; Paul, Prosenjit; Singh, Ravail",Gene Rep,,427

520761,Modeling of Vaccination and Contact Tracing as Tools to Control the COVID-19 Outbreak in Spain,2021,"Respiratory virus challenge studies involve administration of the challenge virus and sampling to assess for protection from the same anatomical locations. It can therefore be difficult to differentiate actively replicating virus from input challenge virus. For SARS-CoV-2, specific monitoring of actively replicating virus is critical to investigate the protective and therapeutic efficacy of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and antiviral drugs. We developed a SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) RT-PCR assay to differentiate productive infection from inactivated or neutralized virus. Subgenomic RNAs are generated after cell entry and are poorly incorporate into mature virions, and thus may provide a marker for actively replicating virus. We show envelope (E) sgRNA was degraded by RNase in infected cell lysates, while genomic RNA (gRNA) was protected, presumably due to packaging into virions. To investigate the capacity of the sgRNA assay to distinguish input challenge virus from actively replicating virus in vivo, we compared the E sgRNA assay to a standard nucleoprotein (N) or E total RNA assay in convalescent rhesus macaques and in antibody-treated rhesus macaques after experimental SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In both studies, the E sgRNA assay was negative, suggesting protective efficacy, whereas the N and E total RNA assays remained positive. These data suggest the potential utility of sgRNA to monitor actively replicating virus in prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 studies.ImportanceDeveloping therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a public health priority. During challenge studies, respiratory viruses are delivered and sampled from the same anatomical location. It is therefore important to distinguish actively replicating virus from input challenge virus. The most common assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting nucleocapsid total RNA, cannot distinguish neutralized input virus from replicating virus. In this study, we assess SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA as a potential measure of replicating virus in rhesus macaques.","Dagotto, Gabriel; Mercado, Noe B; Martinez, David R; Hou, Yixuan J; Nkolola, Joseph P; Carnahan, Robert H; Crowe, James E; Baric, Ralph S; Barouch, Dan H",J. virol,,427

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected all aspects of everyday life worldwide, including the entire working sector. This study aims to evaluate the response capacity of some Italian companies to the emergency about workers' health and safety. Methods. Data were cross-sectional, collected by a specially drafted 19-item checklist sent to 60 enterprises located in the province of L'Aquila, Abruzzo, Italy. Results. Forty-one companies (68%) responded by filling in the checklist; more than 50% have fewer than 50 employees each and most of the companies belong to the food industry and the financial services. Adherence to the containment measures for the COVID-19 emergency was analysed, especially relating to job organization, social distancing, sanitization and specific training. Large enterprises and the banking sector showed ductile work reorganization according to the containment measures compared to small companies and the food sector. Conclusions. Italian companies have shown a good response to the regulatory restrictions resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 emergency. This is a worthy premise for the imminent management of Phase 2, with the progressive reopening of Italian companies.","Garzillo, Elpidio Maria; Monaco, Maria Grazia Lourdes; Spacone, Antonio; Inglese, Enrica; Lamberti, Monica; Pompei, Domenico",Int J Occup Saf Ergon,,427

Over 23 million positive cases of COVID-19 have been reported till late August 2020. Medical images such as chest X-rays and Computed Tomography scans are becoming one of the main leading clinical diagnosis tools in fighting against COVID-19, underpinned by Artificial Intelligence based techniques, resulting in rapid decision-making in saving lives. This article provides an extensive review of AI-based methods to assist medical practitioners with comprehensive knowledge of the efficient AI-based methods for efficient COVID-19 diagnosis. Nearly all the reported methods so far along with their pros and cons as well as recommendations for improvements are discussed, including image acquisition, segmentation, classification, and follow-up diagnosis phases developed between 2019 and 2020. AI and machine learning technologies have boosted the accuracy of Covid-19 diagnosis, and most of the widely used deep learning methods have been implemented and worked well with a small amount of data for COVID-19 diagnosis. This review presents a detailed mythological analysis for the evaluation of AI-based methods used in the process of detecting COVID-19 from medical images. However, due to the quick outbreak of Covid-19, there are not many ground-truth datasets available for the communities. It is necessary to combine clinical experts' observations and information from images to have a reliable and efficient COVID-19 diagnosis. This paper suggests that future research may focus on multi-modality based models as well as how to select the best model architecture where AI can introduce more intelligence to medical systems to capture the characteristics of diseases by learning from multi-modality data to obtain reliable results for COVID-19 diagnosis for timely treatment .","Soomro, Toufique A; Zheng, Lihong; Afifi, Ahmed J; Ali, Ahmed; Yin, Ming; Gao, Junbin",Artif Intell Rev,,427

Early ground glass opacities detected by CT, which are reminiscent of lung infarcts associated with pulmonary embolism, point to a novel vascular pathology in COVID-19. Under physiological conditions, normal parenchymal oxygenation is maintained by three sources: the alveolus itself and dual oxygen supply from the pulmonary and bronchial artery circulations. We propose a model in which these three components are disrupted in COVID-19 pneumonia, with severe viral alveolitis and concomitant immunothrombotic obstruction of the pulmonary and bronchiolar circulation. Tricompartmental disruption might have two main consequences: systemic clot embolisation from pulmonary vein territory immunothrombosis, and alveolar-capillary barrier disruption with systemic access of thrombogenic viral material. Our model encompasses the known pathological and clinical features of severe COVID-19, and has implications for understanding patient responses to immunomodulatory therapies, which might exert an anti-inflammatory effect within the vascular compartments.","McGonagle, Dennis; Bridgewood, Charlie; Meaney, James F M",Lancet Respir.

Research on previous epidemics/pandemics suggest that families, particularly mothers, may be at increased risk, but this population has yet to be examined. The current study (1) described prevalence rates of maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms from an online convenience sample during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) identified risk and protective factors for elevated symptoms, and (3) described current mental health service use and barriers. METHODS: Participants (N = 641) were mothers of children age 0-8 years, including expectant mothers. Mothers completed an online survey assessing mental health, sociodemographic information, and COVID-19-related variables. RESULTS: Clinically-relevant depression was indicated in 33.16%, 42.55%, and 43.37% of mothers of children age 0-18 months, 18 months to 4 years, and 5 to 8 years, respectively. Prevalence of anxiety was 36.27%, 32.62%, and 29.59% for mothers across age groups, respectively. Binary logistic regressions indicated significant associations between risk factors and depression/anxiety across child age groups. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional data was used to describe maternal mental health problems during COVID-19 limiting the ability to make inferences about the long-term impact of maternal depression and anxiety on family well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal depression and anxiety appear to be elevated in the context of COVID-19 compared to previously reported population norms. Identified risk factors for depression and anxiety across different child age ranges can inform targeted early intervention strategies to prevent long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on family well-being and child development.","Cameron, Emily E.; Joyce, Kayla M.; Delaquis, Chantal P.; Reynolds, Kristin; Protudjer, Jennifer L.P.; Roos, Leslie E.",J Affect Disord,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016503272032526X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32736186/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016503272032526X?v=s5,427

Methods:This is a single center, retrospective, observational study. All consecutive patients admitted with primary diagnosis of ischemic/ hemorrhagic stroke between March1st -May10th 2020 were included and compared with the same time period in 2019. Results: There was a 41.9% increase in stroke admissions in 2020 (148 vs 210,P = .001). When comparing all ischemic strokes, higher rate of large vessel occlusion (LVO) (18.3% vs 33.8%,P = .008) and significant delay in initiation of mechanical thrombectomy after hospital arrival (67.75 vs 104.30 minutes,P = .001) was observed in 2020. When comparing all hemorrhagic strokes, there were no differences between the two years. Among 591 COVID-19 admissions, 31 (5.24%) patients with stroke including 19 with ischemic (3.21%) and 12 with hemorrhagic stroke (2.03%) were identified. Patients with COVID-19 and ischemic stroke were significantly younger (58.74 vs 48.11 years,P = .002), predominantly male (68.18% vs 94.74%,P = .016), had lesser vascular risk factors, had more severe clinical presentation (NIHSS 7.01 vs 17.05,P < .001), and higher rate of LVO (23.6% vs. 63.1%,P = .006). There was no difference in the rate of endovascular thrombectomy, but time to groin puncture was significantly longer in COVID-19 patients (83.41 vs 129.50 minutes,P = .003). For hemorrhagic stroke, COVID-19 patients did not differ from non-COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Stroke continues to occur during this pandemic and stroke pathways have been affected by the pandemic. Stroke occurs in approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19. COVID-19 associated ischemic stroke occurs in predominantly male patients who are younger, with fewer vascular risk factors, can be more severe, and have higher rates of LVO. Despite an increase in LVO during the pandemic, treatment with mechanical thrombectomy has not increased.

The advent of the internet and social media is no different. Social media creates public streams of communication, and scientists are starting to understand that such data can provide some level of access into the people's opinions and situations. As such, this paper aims to review and synthesize the literature on Twitter applications for public health, highlighting current research and products in practice. A scoping review methodology was employed and four leading health, computer science and cross-disciplinary databases were searched. A total of 755 articles were retreived, 92 of which met the criteria for review. From the reviewed literature, six domains for the application of Twitter to public health were identified: (i) Surveillance; (ii) Event Detection; (iii) Pharmacovigilance; (iv) Forecasting; (v) Disease Tracking; and (vi) Geographic Identification. From our review, we were able to obtain a clear picture of the use of Twitter for public health.

High-dose Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg), derived from thousands of healthy donors, contains natural IgG antibodies against various antigens which can be detected both within the IVIg preparations and in the serum of IVIg-receiving patients. Whether IVIg preparations from pre-pandemic donors also contain antibodies against pre-pandemic coronaviruses or autoreactive antibodies that cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 antigenic epitopes, is unknown. Methods: 13 samples from 5 commercial IVIg preparations from pre-pandemic donors (HyQvia (Baxalta Innovations GmbH); Privigen (CSL Behring); Intratect (Biotest AG); IgVena (Kedrion S.p.A); and Flebogamma (Grifols S.A.) were blindly screened using a semi-quantitative FDA-approved and validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany). Results: Nine of thirteen preparations (69.2%), all from two different manufactures, were antibody-positive based on the defined cut-off positivity (index of sample OD to calibrator OD > 1.1). From one manufacturer, 7/7 lots (100%) and from another 2/3 lots (67%), tested positive for cross-reacting antibodies. 7/9 of the positive preparations (77%) had titers as seen in asymptomatically infected individuals or recent COVID19-recovered patients, while 2/9 (23%) had higher titers, comparable to those seen in patients with active symptomatic COVID-19 infection (index > 2.2). Conclusion: Pre-pandemic IVIg donors have either natural autoantibodies or pre-pandemic cross-reactive antibodies against antigenic protein fragments conserved among the “common cold” - related coronaviruses. The findings are important in: (a) assessing true anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG seroprevalence avoiding false positivity in IVIg-receiving patients; (b) exploring potential protective benefits in patients with immune-mediated conditions and immunodeficiencies receiving acute or chronic maintenance IVIg therapy, and (c) validating data from a recent controlled study that showed significantly lower in-hospital mortality in the IVIg- treated group.","Dalakas, Marinos C.; Bitzogli, Kleopatra; Alexopoulos, Harry",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.627285; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33679770/,427
596634,Spread mechanism and control strategy of social network rumors under the influence of COVID-19,2020-08-10,"INTRODUCTION: Human-centered design (HCD) training offers the potential to improve both team processes and products. However, the use of HCD to improve the quality of team science is a relatively recent application, and its benefits and challenges have not been rigorously evaluated. We conducted a qualitative study with health sciences researchers trained in HCD methods. We aimed to determine how researchers applied HCD methods and perceived the benefits and barriers to using HCD on research teams. METHODS: We conducted 1-hour, semi-structured interviews with trainees from three training cohorts. Interviews focused on perceptions of the training, subsequent uses of HCD, barriers and facilitators, and perceptions of the utility of HCD to science teams. Data analysis was conducted using Braun and Clarke’s process for thematic analysis. RESULTS: We interviewed nine faculty and nine staff trained in HCD methods and identified four themes encompassing HCD use, benefits, challenges, and tensions between HCD approaches and academic culture. CONCLUSIONS: Trainees found HCD relevant to research teams for stakeholder engagement, research design, project planning, meeting facilitation, and team management. They also described benefits of HCD in five distinct areas: creativity, egalitarianism, structure, efficiency, and visibility. Our data suggest that HCD has the potential to help researchers work more inclusively and collaboratively on interdisciplinary teams and generate more innovative and impactful science. The application of HCD methods is not without challenges; however, we believe these challenges can be overcome with institutional investment.","Norman, Marie K.; Hamm, Megan E.; Schenker, Yael; Mayowski, Colleen A.; Hierholzer, William; Rubio, Doris M.; Reis, Steven E.",Journal of clinical and translational science,https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2021.794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367675/,427
597614,California oil: Bridging the gaps between local decision-making and state-level climate action,2020-08-15,"Infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has been associated with villous atrophy within 48 h, which seriously disrupts intestinal homeostasis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we found that TGEV infection severely disrupted intestinal homeostasis via inhibition of self-renewal and differentiation in Lgr5 intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Profoundly, TGEV-encoded NSP10/NSP16 protein complex-mediated the inactivation of Notch signaling provided a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon. Initial invasions by TGEV-targeted Paneth cells through aminopeptidase N (APN) receptor, then inducing mitochondrial damage and ROS generation in them, ultimately causing Paneth cell decrease and loss of Notch factors (DII4 and Hes5), which are essential for Lgr5 ISCs self-renewal and differentiation. Interestingly, loss of Notch signaling induced goblet cells differentiation at the cost of absorptive enterocytes and promoted mucins secretion, which accelerated TGEV replication. Therefore, the more differentiation of goblet cells, the greater TGEV infection in jejunum. These results provide a detailed mechanistic pathway by which villous atrophy sharply occurs in TGEV-infected jejunum within 48 h. Thus, the pathogenesis of TGEV can be described as a “bottom up scenario”, which is contrary to the traditional “top down” hypothesis. Together, our findings provide a potential link between diarrheal virus infection and crypt cells response that regulates Paneth cells function and Lgr5 ISCs fate and could be exploited for therapeutic application.","Wu, Aimin; Yu, Bing; Zhang, Keying; Xu, Zhiwen; Wu, De; He, Jun; Luo, Junqiu; Luo, Yuheng; Yu, Jie; Zheng, Ping; Che, Lianqiang; Mao, Xiangbing; Huang, Zhiqing; Wang, Lan; Zhao, Jun; Chen, Daiwen",Cell Death Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31959773/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-020-2233-6,427

The aim of this narrative review was twofold: to summarize key areas from the Canadian protocols available for the reopening and restructuring of dental services across the country and to critically review these protocols based on existing evidence. A narrative review of the existing Canadian protocols, written in English and French, was undertaken between April 15 and July 13, 2020. The protocols were obtained by searching through regulatory bodies and websites from professional organizations, and from personal contacts through academic institutions and policy leaders. The data extraction form focused only on protocols related to dentistry, and the information was compiled by a hired assistant. Content was categorized via group discussions with the research team on eight areas: office management and procedures, patient and staff screening, treatment procedures, office layout, risk reduction, personal protective equipment, supporting information, and length and readability. Thirteen protocols were identified and offered substantial variation in the level of details provided. All but two protocols specified proper donning/doffing of personal protective equipment, while all protocols recommended daily monitoring of COVID-19 related signs and symptoms in staff and patients. They varied in terms of recommended mask types, eye and face shield protection, and head coverings. While all protocols aimed at restructuring emergency dental services, their recommendations were often not based on the published evidence. This narrative review summarized key areas from 13 provincial and territorial protocols in Canada to help oral health care providers plan the reopening of their services. The information conveyed across all documents was clear, but variance highlights the need for a coordinated effort to develop an evidence-based document for dental practitioners.","Brondani, Mario; Cua, Denise; Maragha, Tala; Shayanfar, Melody; Mathu-Muju, Kavita; von Bergmann, HsingChi; Almeida, Fernanda; Villanueva, Jeannie; Alvarado, Alexis Armando Vides; Learey, Stephen; Donnelly, Leeann",BMC Oral Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-020-01340-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33267811/,427
599428,Countrywide population movement monitoring using mobile devices generated (big) data during the COVID-19 crisis,2021-03-15,"Study Objectives: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has become an important tool in the global response to COVID-19, supporting screening, diagnosis and management. Lung features described in COVID-19 include B-lines (ring-down artifacts appearing in the presence of interstitial lung fluid), thickened and irregular pleural line, subpleural consolidations and effusions. Computer-aided interpretation can be incorporated into POCUS platforms to provide objective data and improve interpretations by novices. We sought to test a commercially available B-Lines counting feature previously developed using non-COVID data, on patients suspected of COVID-19. This first step would allow expansion to automated B-line scoring and further lung feature detection, to create an intelligent POCUS system with comprehensive set of lung ultrasound features for COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This was a prospective observational study at a single academic medical center. Subjects presenting to the emergency department with shortness of breath and suspected COVID-19 were enrolled. The Philips Lumify TM ultrasound system with sector or linear transducer was used to obtain 6-second clips of 14 lung zones (upper and lower, right and left anterior, lateral and posterior). Right and left anterior upper zone clips were also obtained with a second probe type. Repeat examinations with data collection were performed on days 3, 5, 7 or 12+/- 1 day for admitted patients. All clips with 2 or more B-lines were included (N=80), as well as a random selection of 70 clips with 1 or fewer B-lines. B-line count for inclusion was based on visual rating by two researchers with POCUS training. A POCUS fellowship trained emergency physician visually assessed each clip frame and counted the maximum number of B-lines per clip. This was compared to automatic counts by the commercially available Lumify TM Lung B-lines Quantification software by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cohen’s weighted kappa. Results: Of the 899 total clips,150 clips from 30 unique subjects and 44 overall exams were used for analysis, with 100 clips from patients with confirmed COVID by PCR. The average maximum B-line count by algorithm was 1.52 +/- 1.24, and that by expert was 1.60 +/- 1.35 (ns). The ICC between algorithm and expert was 0.87 (95% CI 0.83-0.91), with a weighted kappa of 0.64 (95% CI 0.48-0.81), indicating substantial agreement. Average of maximum B-line counts, ICC and weighted kappa between algorithm and expert were comparable for COVID+ and COVID- subgroups as well as between transducer types. For COVID + subgroup, the average of maximum B-line counts was 1.73 +/- 1.28 for algorithm and 1.78 +/- 1.37 for expert, with weighted kappa 0.67 (95% CI 0.50-0.84), and ICC 0.87 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.91). Conclusion: An automated algorithm developed on non-COVID patients can accurately distinguish and quantify B-lines in clips from patients with COVID-19, with substantial agreement to expert visual rating.

600133,Grand challenges and global solutions: where does injury prevention fit in?,2021-09-20,"Because of the conflicting data concerning the SARS-CoV inhibitory efficacy of ribavirin, an inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase inhibitor, studies were done to evaluate the efficacy of ribavirin and other IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors (5-ethynyl-1-β-d-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (EICAR), mizoribine, and mycophenolic acid) in preventing viral replication in the lungs of BALB/c mice, a replication model for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections (Subbarao, K., McAuliffe, J., Vogel, L., Fahle, G., Fischer, S., Tatti, K., Packard, M., Shieh, W.J., Zaki, S., Murphy, B., 2004. Prior infection and passive transfer of neutralizing antibody prevent replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the respiratory tract of mice. J. Virol. 78, 3572–3577). Ribavirin given at 75 mg/kg 4 h prior to virus exposure and then given twice daily for 3 days beginning at day 0 was found to increase virus lung titers and extend the length of time that virus could be detected in the lungs of mice. Other IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors administered near maximum tolerated doses using the same dosing regimen as for ribavirin were found to slightly enhance virus replication in the lungs. In addition, ribavirin treatment seemed also to promote the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 4 days after cessation of treatment, although after 3 days of treatment ribavirin inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine production in infected mice, significantly reducing the levels of the cytokines IL-1α, interleukin-5 (IL-5), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). These findings suggest that ribavirin may actually contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV by prolonging and/or enhancing viral replication in the lungs. By not inhibiting viral replication in the lungs of infected mice, ribavirin treatment may have provided a continual source of stimulation for the inflammatory response thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of the infection. Our data do not support the use of ribavirin or other IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors for treating SARS infections in humans.","Barnard, Dale L.; Day, Craig W.; Bailey, Kevin; Heiner, Matthew; Montgomery, Robert; Lauridsen, Larry; Winslow, Scott; Hoopes, Justin; Li, Joseph K.-K.; Lee, Jongdae; Carson, Dennis A.; Cottam, Howard B.; Sidwell, Robert W.",Antiviral Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354206000660; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354206000660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16621037/,427

The assortment of reporting techniques alongside other issues, such as underreporting and budgetary constraints, makes predicting the spread and lethality of the virus a challenging task. This work attempts to gain a better understanding of how COVID-19 will affect one of the least studied countries, namely Brazil. Currently, several Brazilian states are in a state of lock-down. However, there is political pressure for this type of measures to be lifted. This work considers the impact that such a termination would have on how the virus evolves locally. This was done by extending the SEIR model with an on / off strategy. Given the simplicity of SEIR we also attempted to gain more insight by developing a neural regressor. We chose to employ features that current clinical studies have pinpointed has having a connection to the lethality of COVID-19.

MATERIAL: Two manuscripts were presented at the 6(th) EAO Consensus Conference. The first study compared the most recent national guidelines/recommendations of European countries. The second paper was an experts’ opinion‐based survey on application of ICP regulation during the second wave. The outcome of COVID‐19 group discussion was presented to all participants of the consensus to come to an agreement about the consensus statements and clinical recommendation. RESULTS: The dynamic of the pandemic had an impact on rapidly published and frequently updated national guidelines in Europe. As guidelines were not based on solid evidence, they were supplemented by experts’ opinion on ICP in dentistry. The dental care should be guaranteed during the pandemic, however in case of suspected or confirmed COVID‐19 disease, the treatment should be postponed if possible. Remote triage and patient‐related measures (i.e., social distancing, hand hygiene and mask wearing) were recommended to be the most efficient to reduce SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission. The type of personal protective equipment for dental staff should be adequate to the procedure and infection risk. CONCLUSIONS: Adequate infection control protocols have to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients to minimise the spreading of COVID‐19.

DESIGN: Prospective multicentre diagnostic validation study. SETTING: Royal Children’s Hospital, and two general practices (cohealth, West Melbourne; Cirqit Health, Altona North) in Melbourne, July–October 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 1050 people who provided paired saliva and oropharyngeal‐nasal swabs for SARS‐CoV‐2 testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers of cases in which SARS‐CoV‐2 was detected in either specimen type by real‐time polymerase chain reaction; concordance of results for paired specimens; positive percent agreement (PPA) for virus detection, by specimen type. RESULTS: SARS‐CoV‐2 was detected in 54 of 1050 people with assessable specimens (5%), including 19 cases (35%) in which both specimens were positive. The overall PPA was 72% (95% CI, 58–84%) for saliva and 63% (95% CI, 49–76%) for oropharyngeal‐nasal swabs. For the 35 positive specimens from people aged 10 years or more, PPA was 86% (95% CI, 70–95%) for saliva and 63% (95% CI, 45–79%) for oropharyngeal‐nasal swabs. Adding saliva testing to standard‐of‐care oropharyngeal‐nasal swab testing increased overall case detection by 59% (95% CI, 29–95%). Providing saliva was preferred to an oropharyngeal‐nasal swab by most participants (75%), including 141 of 153 children under 10 years of age (92%). CONCLUSION: In children over 10 years of age and adults, saliva testing alone may be suitable for SARS‐CoV‐2 detection, while for children under 10, saliva testing may be suitable as an adjunct to oropharyngeal‐nasal swab testing for increasing case detection.","Oliver, Jane; Tosif, Shidan; Lee, Lai‐yang; Costa, Anna‐Maria; Bartel, Chelsea; Last, Katherine; Clifford, Vanessa; Daley, Andrew; Allard, Nicole; Orr, Catherine; Nind, Ashley; Alexander, Karyn; Meagher, Niamh; Sait, Michelle; Ballard, Susan A; Williams, Eloise; Bond, Katherine; Williamson, Deborah A; Crawford, Nigel W; Gibney, Katherine B",Med J Aust,https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.51188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287935/,427

GP clusters commenced across Scotland in 2016 to improve the quality of care of local populations. AIM: To determine GPs' views on clusters, and the robustness of bespoke questions about them. DESIGN & SETTING: A cross-sectional national survey of work satisfaction of GPs in Scotland took place, which was conducted in July 2018–October 2018. METHOD: An analysis of bespoke questions on GP clusters was undertaken. The questions were completed by quality leads (QLs) and all other GPs in a nationally representative sample of GPs. RESULTS: In total, 2456 responses were received from 4371 GPs (56.4%). QLs reported that clusters were meeting regularly, and were friendly and well organised but not always productive. Support for cluster activity (data, health intelligence, analysis, quality improvement methods, advice, leadership, and evaluation) was suboptimal. Factor analysis identified two separate constructs (cluster meetings [CMs] and cluster support [CS]), which were minimally influenced (<2%) by GP and practice characteristics. Non-QLs (75% of all GPs) were generally satisfied with the two-way communication with the cluster QLs, but the great majority (>70%) reported no positive changes in various aspects of quality improvement. Factor analysis of these items indicated two constructs (cluster knowledge and engagement [CKE] and cluster quality improvement [CQI]), which were minimally affected by GP and practice characteristics. CONCLUSION: GP clusters are ‘up and running’ in Scotland but are at an early stage in terms of perceived impact and appear to be in need of more support in order to improve quality of care.

In Ireland, the power to detain and isolate probable sources of infectious disease is found in the Health Act 1947. The objective of this study was to describe the use of the power to detain, and to examine relevant legal implications. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort survey. METHODS: Respiratory and infectious disease physicians practising in the public sector were invited to complete a self-administered postal questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 44 clinicians surveyed, 33 responded, representing a total of 356 years of specialist practice (mean 10.8 years). Although 70% of respondents had made use of threats of formal detention in dealing with non-compliant patients, only one formal detention under statutory powers was identified. Infrastructural and legal concerns with the use of detention were common. There was widespread support for a broadening of the range of additional public health powers, including a power of prolonged detention in the setting of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: Detention and isolation of non-compliant tuberculosis patients remains in active use. Physicians detaining, or threatening to detain, patients continue to expose themselves to legal liability because of the outdated legal framework underlying those powers.","Duffy, S.T.",Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350608002540; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2008.09.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19091360/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350608002540,427

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This multicenter prospective study involved 174 patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomized into two groups. Group A (96 patients) received sofosbuvir (400 mg)/ daclatasvir (60 mg) for 14 days in combination with conventional therapy. Group B (78 patients) received conventional therapy alone. Clinical, laboratory and radiological data were collected at baseline, after 7, 14 and 28 days of therapy. Primary endpoint was rate of clinical/virological cure. RESULTS A lower mortality rate was observed in group (A) (14% vs 21%, P = 0.07). After one month of therapy, no differences were found in rates of ICU admission, oxygen therapy or ventilation.

However, the relationship between COVID-19 and male sexual activity did not yet get much consideration. Herein, we report the impact of COVID-19 on sexual function in 3 men who recovered from the disease. Compared with their condition before catching the infection, the men showed, in different degrees, a decline in all aspects of sexual function as assessed by the international index of erectile function. They started to develop premature ejaculation or exacerbate an already existing condition according to the premature ejaculation diagnostic tool scoring. Beck’s depression inventory revealed deterioration of the men’s moods up to severe depression. The sex-related hormones (testosterone-total and free, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and estradiol) of these men were within normal levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report documenting deleterious changes in mood and several aspects of sexual functioning in males after recovery from the COVID-19 using validated measurement tools. Follow-up and psychological support of the recovered men may help mend their moods and consequently upgrade their sexual functioning.","Salama, Nader; Blgozah, Saeed",Clin Med Insights Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1177/11795476211020593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104031/,427

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to (1) describe how food-insecure emerging adults are adapting their eating and child-feeding behaviors during COVID-19 and (2) identify barriers and opportunities to improve local food access and access to food assistance. DESIGN The COVID-19 Eating and Activity Over Time study collected survey data from emerging adults during April to October 2020 and completed interviews with a diverse subset of food-insecure respondents. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING A total of 720 emerging adults (mean age: 24.7 ± 2.0 years; 62% female; 90% living in Minnesota) completed an online survey, and a predominately female subsample (n = 33) completed an interview by telephone or videoconference. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Survey measures included the short-form of the US Household Food Security Survey Module and 2 items to assess food insufficiency. Interviews assessed eating and feeding behaviors along with barriers to healthy food access. ANALYSES PERFORMED Descriptive statistics and a hybrid deductive and inductive content analysis. RESULTS Nearly one-third of survey respondents had experienced food insecurity in the past year. Interviews with food-insecure participants identified 6 themes with regard to changes in eating and feeding behavior (eg, more processed food, sporadic eating), 5 themes regarding local food access barriers (eg, limited enforcement of COVID-19 safety practices, experiencing discrimination), and 4 themes regarding barriers to accessing food assistance (eg, lack of eligibility, difficulty in locating pantries). Identified recommendations include (1) expanding the distribution of information about food pantries and meal distribution sites, and (2) increasing fresh fruit and vegetable offerings at these sites. CONCLUSIONS Interventions of specific relevance to COVID-19 (eg, stronger implementation of safety practices) and expanded food assistance services are needed to improve the accessibility of healthy food for emerging adults.","Larson, Nicole; Alexander, Tricia; Slaughter-Acey, Jaime C; Berge, Jerica; Widome, Rachel; Neumark-Sztainer, Dianne",Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34294591/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2021.05.018,427
607726,Mobility Zones,2020-07-18,"PURPOSE: Thyroid dysfunction, including thyroiditis, is well recognized in COVID-19 patients. We evaluated thyroid ultrasonographic features among COVID-19 survivors, which are less well known. METHODS: Adult COVID-19 survivors without known thyroid disorders who attended dedicated COVID-19 clinic underwent thyroid ultrasonography and assessment of thyroid function and autoimmunity. Adults admitted for acute non-thyroidal surgical problems and negative for COVID-19 were recruited as control. SARS-CoV-2 viral load (VL) was presented as the inverse of cycle threshold values from the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of the respiratory specimen on admission. RESULTS: In total, 79 COVID-19 patients and 44 non-COVID-19 controls were included. All abnormal thyroid function tests during acute COVID-19 recovered upon follow-up. Thyroid ultrasonography was performed at a median of 67 days after acute COVID-19. The median thyroid volume was 9.73 mL (IQR: 7.87–13.70). In multivariable linear regression, SARS-CoV-2 VL on presentation (standardized beta −0.206, p = 0.042) inversely correlated with thyroid volume, in addition to body mass index at the time of ultrasonography (p < 0.001). Sex-specific analysis revealed similar results among men but not women. Eleven COVID-19 patients (13.9%) had ultrasonographic changes suggestive of thyroiditis, comparable to non-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.375). None of these 11 patients had isolated low thyroid-stimulating hormone levels suggestive of thyroiditis at initial admission or the time of ultrasonography. CONCLUSIONS: Higher SARS-CoV-2 VL on presentation were associated with smaller thyroid volumes, especially in men. Further research is suggested to investigate this possible direct viral effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the thyroid gland. There was no increased rate of ultrasonographic features suggestive of thyroiditis in COVID-19 survivors.","Lui, David Tak Wai; Fung, Matrix Man Him; Chiu, Keith Wan Hang; Lee, Chi Ho; Chow, Wing Sun; Lee, Alan Chun Hong; Tam, Anthony Raymond; Pang, Polly; Ho, Tip Yin; Fong, Carol Ho Yi; Loong, Connie Hong Nin; Wong, Wade Wei; Lee, Cassandra Yuen Yan; Law, Chun Yiu; To, Kelvin Kai Wang; Lam, Ching Wan; Tan, Kathryn Choon Beng; Woo, Yu Cho; Hung, Ivan Fan Ngai; Lam, Karen Siu Ling; Lang, Brian Hung Hin",Endocrine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12020-021-02855-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34467467/,427

We emphasize differences of the effects of each ligand, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11, on fibroblasts in different tissues of the body. We include discussions of differences in signaling pathways that may account for protective or pro-fibrotic effects of each ligand in different experimental models and ex vivo analysis of human tissues.

Although the current number of confirmed patients is tiny compared to seasonal and the recently emerged H1N1 ‘swine’ influenza, H5N1 remains a candidate for the next highly pathogenic influenza pandemic. Currently, H5N1 has very limited ability to spread from person-to-person but this may change because of mutation or reassortment with other influenza viruses leading to an influenza pandemic with high mortality. If this occurs travellers are likely to be affected and travel medicine doctors will need to consider avian influenza in returning febrile travellers. The early clinical features may be dismissed easily as ‘the flu’ resulting in delayed treatment. Treatment options are limited. Oral oseltamivir alone has been the most commonly used drug but mortality remains substantial, up to 80% in Indonesia. Intravenous peramivir has been filed for registration and IV zanamivir is being developed.

Several enteropathogens are associated with diarrhea in young calves, with Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection being the most common type of colibacillosis. The rise of antibiotic resistance in a number of medically important bacterial pathogens has revived interest in the use of bacteriophages as anti-bacterial therapeutic agents. Here we describe the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study designed to evaluate the effect of an oral bacteriophage cocktail on fecal E. coli colony-forming units (CFU). Ten calves were enrolled in the study to either the bacteriophage group or the placebo group for 22 feedings. Calves in the bacteriophage treatment group (n = 6) received a total of 10(6) plaque-forming units (PFU) (volume = 5 ml) of each of four bacteriophages while the placebo group (n = 4) received only phosphate-buffered saline (5 ml). Fresh fecal samples and blood samples were collected daily from each calf and analyzed for bacterial count and presence of bacteriophage. E. coli-infecting phages were recovered from all phage-treated calves at concentrations of 10² to 10³ PFU per gram of rectal contents, but none was detected in serum. Phage treatment caused a reduction in fecal E. coli when compared to the control group: the mean log CFU for the placebo-treated group was 9.25 (SE = 0.42) versus 9.11 (SE = 0.34) for the phage-treated group, but the difference was not statistically significant.","Bicalho, M.L.S.; Machado, V.S.; Nydam, D.V.; Santos, T.M.A.; Bicalho, R.C.",Livest Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362952/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871141311004458; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2011.12.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871141311004458,427

It shorts hospitalization time compared to placebo. Kidney transplant (KT) patients were not included in these studies, therefore, its effects in this population is limited to some published cases. METHOD: We performed a retrospective observational study that included all KT patients admitted between August 01, 2020 and November 17, 2020 with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who received treatment with remdesivir. Patients received a 200mg loading dose followed by 100 mg/day maintenance dose for 5 days. The objective of this study was to describe the experience of a cohort of KT patients treated with remdesivir. RESULTS: A total of 36 KT patients developed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 6 of them received treatment with remdesivir. The rest of the patients did not receive the drug due to either CKD-EPI less than 30 mL/min or they did not present clinical criteria. In addition to remdesivir, all pacients received dexamethasone and anticoagulation therapy. Immunosuppression was suspended in all patients, maintaining only dexamethasone. 50% were men, the median age was 58.5 (52.75–68) years. 67% had unknown underlying kidney disease, 83% were hypertensive and 33% had diabetes. All patients received KT from deceased brain donor and 50% received thymoglobulin as induction treatment. Median time from transplantation was 49 (20.5–135.5) months, with median glomerular filtration at admission of 47.5 (42.25–63.25) mL/min. The most frequent clinical manifestation was dry cough and dyspnea (83%), followed by tachypnea and fever (67%). Chest X-rays of all patients showed pulmonary infiltrates and required low oxygen flow therapy upon admission, requiring high flow nasal therapy in 33% of cases during admission. Only 17% of the cases presented deterioration of the graft function, not requiring hemodialysis in any case, and all recovered renal function at hospital discharge. No patient died or required admission to the critical care unit. Median days of admission was 12 (10–18) days. CONCLUSION: KT patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia under treatment with remdesivir have a good clinical course, with few cases of renal function deterioration and a low mortality rate. Additional studies are necessary with a larger number of patients to improve the knowledge of remdesivir in KT with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Cacho, Judit; Molina Gomez, Maria; Burgos García, Elena; Villegas, Andres; Pérez-Mir, Mónica; Cañas Sole, Laura; Taco, Omar; Juega Mariã‘o, Francisco Javier; Lauzurica, Ricardo",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab111.0015,427

Representative population-based data, including asymptomatic individuals for assessing the viral spread and immune response were, however, lacking worldwide. METHODS: Using a panel-based method, we implemented a representative sample of the Luxembourgish population based on age, gender and residency for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody status in order to define prevalence irrespective of clinical symptoms. Participants were contacted via email to fill an online questionnaire before biosampling at local laboratories. All participants provided information related to clinical symptoms, epidemiology, socioeconomic and psychological assessments and underwent biosampling, rRT-PCR testing and serology for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We included a total of 1862 individuals in our representative sample of the general Luxembourgish population. Of these, 5 individuals had a current positive result for infection with SARS-CoV-2 based on rRT-PCR. Four of these individuals were oligosymptomatic and one was asymptomatic. Overall we found a positive IgG antibody status in 35 individuals (1.97%), of which 11 reported to be tested positive by rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 previously and showed in addition their IgG positive status also a positive status for IgA. Our data indicate a prevalence of 0.3% for active SARS-CoV-2 infection and an infection rate of 2.15% in the Luxembourgish population between 18 and 79 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Luxembourgish residents show a low rate of acute infections after 7 weeks of confinement and present with an antibody profile indicative of a more recent immune response to SARS-CoV-2. All infected individuals were oligo- or asymptomatic. Bi-weekly follow-up visits over the next 2 months will inform about the viral spread by a- and oligosymptomatic carriers and the individual changes in the immune profile.","Snoeck, C.

611891,Population birth data and pandemic readiness in Europe,2021,"Driven by flexibility, precision, repeatability and eco-friendliness, laser-based technologies have attracted great interest to engineer or to analyze materials in various fields including energy, environment, biology and medicine. A major advantage of laser processing relies on the ability to directly structure matter at different scales and to prepare novel materials with unique physical and chemical properties. It is also a contact-free approach that makes it possible to work in inert or reactive liquid or gaseous environment. This leads today to a unique opportunity for designing, fabricating and even analyzing novel complex bio-systems. To illustrate this potential, in this paper, we gather our recent research on four types of laser-based methods relevant for nano-/micro-scale applications. First, we present and discuss pulsed laser ablation in liquid, exploited today for synthetizing ultraclean “bare” nanoparticles attractive for medicine and tissue engineering applications. Second, we discuss robust methods for rapid surface and bulk machining (subtractive manufacturing) at different scales by laser ablation. Among them, the microsphere-assisted laser surface engineering is detailed for its appropriateness to design structured substrates with hierarchically periodic patterns at nano-/micro-scale without chemical treatments. Third, we address the laser-induced forward transfer, a technology based on direct laser printing, to transfer and assemble a multitude of materials (additive structuring), including biological moiety without alteration of functionality. Finally, the fourth method is about chemical analysis: we present the potential of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, providing a unique tool for contact-free and space-resolved elemental analysis of organic materials. Overall, we present and discuss the prospect and complementarity of emerging reliable laser technologies, to address challenges in materials’ preparation relevant for the development of innovative multi-scale and multi-material platforms for bio-applications.","Al-Kattan, Ahmed; Grojo, David; Drouet, Christophe; Mouskeftaras, Alexandros; Delaporte, Philippe; Casanova, Adrien; Robin, Jérôme D.; Magdinier, Frédérique; Alloncle, Patricia; Constantinescu, Catalin; Motto-Ros, Vincent; Hermann, Jörg",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33809072/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11030712,427

We planned a prospective study to evaluate the immune response after the administration of Covid-19 vaccine in HSCT recipients. Fifty patients previously submitted to HSCT (38 autologous and 12 allogeneic) received the mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech). Serum samples of all patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG against the Spike glycoprotein, 30 days after the second dose of vaccine. Antibody response was compared to a control group of 45 healthy subjects. Of the 50 patients tested, 12 did not develop any antibody response, including 6 patients undergoing autologous (16%) and 6 allogeneic HSCT (50%). Cyclosporine administration in allogeneic recipients and prior administration of Rituximab in the autologous setting correlated with lower antibody titers (p < 0.0003 and p=0.000, respectively). Flow cytometry of peripheral blood samples, performed 30 days after the vaccination, showed a significant correlation between the antibody response to Sars-COV2 and an increased number in CD19+ B lymphocytes (p = 0.0003) and CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells (p = 0.00). In conclusion, prior Rituximab before autologous HSCT and cyclosporine administration after allogeneic HSCT negatively affected the antibody response to Sars-COV2 vaccine, possibly due to their immunosuppressive action on CD20 +B cells and T cells, respectively. The correlation between seroconversion to Sars-COV2 and higher number of CD19 + B cells and CD56+ NK cells, suggests a central role for B and NK cells in the development of COVID-19 immunity after vaccination with a mRNA-based platform.","Chiarucci, Martina; Paolasini, Sara; Isidori, Alessandro; Guiducci, Barbara; Loscocco, Federica; Capalbo, Maria; Visani, Giuseppe",Front Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.737300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34552880/,427

Most examinations of bullying roles have relied on self-reported data, which suffer from key limitations such as response and recall bias. Twitter data provides a way to overcome these limitations and extend our current understanding of bullying roles. The current study provides one of the first qualitative examinations of tweets to analyze the disclosure and sharing of bullying-related online and offline episodes. Through a qualitative content analysis, the study examines 780 tweets to analyze the descriptions and characteristics of three participant roles: the perpetrator, target, and helper. The results provide multidimensional insights into the context and relationships between bullying roles. The results reveal that each of the bullying role players tweet to share varying perspectives and the discussions transcend beyond just online exchanges. The results also confirm that Twitter is used not only as a channel for bullying but also as a tool for connection between the different role players. Implications of how Twitter can be leveraged to promote anti-bullying initiatives to educate and inform users about bullying, while also helping build resilience and emotional regulation, are discussed. Additionally, the study also has implications for artificial intelligence and can help to build improved classifiers to detect bullying-related discourse and content online.","Sainju, Karla Dhungana; Kuffour, Akosua; Young, Lisa; Mishra, Niti",Int J Bullying Prev,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42380-021-00098-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34124584/,427

Face mask use has been associated with discomfort due to its effects on thermoregulation, breathing and oxygenation. We evaluated the prevalence and severity of self-reported cardiovascular symptoms before and during face mask use. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 1001 participants residing in Singapore, who participated in a self-administered questionnaire between 25th April 2020 to 4th May 2020. Symptom severity before and during mask use and health-seeking behaviour information were collected. The study outcome was the self-reported worsening of cardiovascular symptoms, and its association with the type of mask worn, duration of mask worn per day, and intensity of physical activities during mask use. RESULTS: The commonest symptom reported during mask use was dyspnoea. Independent predictors for self-reported cardiovascular symptoms during mask use were moderate-high physical activity during mask use (OR 1.634, 95% CI 1.176-2.270, p=0.003), duration of mask use ≥3 hours (OR 1.672, 95% CI 1.189-2.352, p=0.003) and the type of mask used, after adjusting for age, sex, healthcare-based worker status and presence of comorbidities. N95 mask was associated with worse symptoms when compared to surgical mask. Participants with ≥3 worsening symptoms, or worsening dyspnoea, palpitations, fatigue and dizziness were more likely to seek medical help. CONCLUSION: Face mask use is proven to be an effective way in curbing COVID-19 transmission. However, participants in this study had concerns regarding its use and these concerns should be urgently addressed to enable mask-use policies to be enacted.","Chew, Nicholas Ws; Wong, Raymond Cc; Djohan, Andie Hartanto; Ngiam, Jinghao Nicholas; Chai, Ping; Yeo, Tiong-Cheng; Tan, Huay-Cheem; Sia, Ching-Hui",Singap. med. j,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34600453/; https://doi.org/10.11622/smedj.2021140,427

METHODOLOGY: In 2020, overall, 130 elderly people were selected from communities in Xiangtan City and Changsha City of Hunan Province, China and randomly divided into two groups, with 65 people in each group. One group was the experimental group that participated in the exercise intervention for 8 weeks as the objects of group reminiscence therapy intervention in combination with physical exercise. The other group was the control group that listened to 4 routine health lectures. Spirituality Index of Well-Being, ULS Loneliness Scale and Brief Resilience Scale were used to evaluate the effect of the intervention. RESULTS: Before the intervention, there was no significant difference between the experimental group and the control group, but after 8 weeks of exercise intervention, the score of loneliness was lower in the experimental group than in the control group (P<0.05), the scores of spiritual well-being and resilience were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group (P<0.05); and the differences before and after the intervention were significantly higher in the experimental group than the control group (P<0.05).

METHODS: This geo-epidemiological analysis was based on data publicly available on government and administration websites for the 96 administrative departments of metropolitan France between March 19 and May 11, 2020, including Public Health France, the Regional Health Agencies, the French national statistics institute, and the Ministry of Health. Using hierarchical ascendant classification on principal component analysis of multidimensional variables, and multivariate analyses with generalised additive models, we assessed the associations between several factors (spatiotemporal spread of the epidemic between Feb 7 and March 17, 2020, the national lockdown, demographic population structure, baseline intensive care capacities, baseline population health and health-care services, new chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine dispensations, economic indicators, degree of urbanisation, and climate profile) and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and case fatality rates. Incidence rate was defined as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, mortality rate as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths per 100 000, and case fatality rate as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths per cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 cases. FINDINGS: From March 19 to May 11, 2020, hospitals in metropolitan France notified a total of 100 988 COVID-19 cases, including 16 597 people who were admitted to intensive care and 17 062 deaths. There was an overall cumulative in-hospital incidence rate of 155·6 cases per 100 000 inhabitants (range 19·4–489·5), in-hospital mortality rate of 26·3 deaths per 100 000 (1·1–119·2), and in-hospital case fatality rate of 16·9% (4·8–26·2). We found clear spatial heterogeneity of in-hospital COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates, following the spread of the epidemic. After multivariate adjustment, the delay between the first COVID-19-associated death and the onset of the national lockdown was positively associated with in-hospital incidence (adjusted standardised incidence ratio 1·02, 95% CI 1·01–1·04), mortality (adjusted standardised mortality ratio 1·04, 1·02–1·06), and case fatality rates (adjusted standardised fatality ratio 1·01, 1·01–1·02). Mortality and case fatality rates were higher in departments with older populations (adjusted standardised ratio for populations with a high proportion older than aged >85 years 2·17 [95% CI 1·20–3·90] for mortality and 1·43 [1·08–1·88] for case fatality rate). Mortality rate was also associated with incidence rate (1·0004, 1·0002–1·001), but mortality and case fatality rates did not appear to be associated with baseline intensive care capacities. We found no association between climate and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence, or between economic indicators and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence or mortality rates. INTERPRETATION: This ecological study highlights the impact of the epidemic spread, national lockdown, and reactive adaptation of intensive care capacities on the spatial distribution of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. It provides information for future geo-epidemiological analyses and has implications for preparedness and response policies to current and future epidemic waves in France and elsewhere.

617505,Can digitization mitigate the economic damage of a pandemic? Evidence from SARS,2020-09-28,"La récente pandémie de COVID-19 a révélé la nécessité de produire en masse des ventilateurs pour les patients en syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë afin de couvrir les graves déficits de matériels liés à l’afflux anormalement élevé de patients dans les services de réanimation. MakAir est un ventilateur mécanique conçu grâce au recours à l’impression 3D et l’open-source logiciel et matériel. Facile à produire en masse, il est destiné aux pandémies de type COVID-19. Pour faciliter sa production en temps de crise, la version minimale du dispositif médical de classe IIb MakAir fonctionne uniquement en pression contrôlée avec une turbine lui permettant d’être autonome en air. Une source d’oxygène (O2) externe permet d’insuffler un mélange allant jusqu’à 0,8 d’O2 en fraction d’air inspiré. Le MakAir a fait l’objet d’une évaluation préclinique complète sur banc d’essai. Le MakAir fournit une assistance ventilatoire conforme à la consigne dans des cas simulés d’insuffisance respiratoire aiguë dans divers scénarios de résistance. Traduit en pression motrice de 10–15cmH2O, les consignes de ventilation en pression permettent une bonne approximation du volume courant. De même, le contrôle de l’apport en O2 par un débitmètre permet d’estimer la FiO2. Les performances techniques du MakAir sont conformes aux exigences appliquées aux appareils destinés à un usage commercial. Si la mise à disposition de matériel en nombre suffisant ne peut que soulager des équipes sur-sollicitées en période de crise, le MakAir peut constituer une alternative intéressante pour les pays à revenu faible ou modéré. Les caractéristiques du MakAir en open-source permettent également d’améliorer, de développer et de tester en continu, en parallèle et de manière délocalisée plusieurs améliorations technologiques et/ou algorithmiques, voire de produire une déclinaison locale. The recent COVID-19 pandemic revealed the need for mass production of ventilators for patients with severe respiratory failure. MakAir is a mechanical ventilator designed using 3D printing and open-source software and hardware. Easy to mass-produce, it is intended for use in COVID-19 like pandemics. To facilitate its production in times of crisis, the minimal version of the class IIb medical device MakAir, works only in controlled pressure with a turbine allowing it to be air autonomous. An external source of oxygen allows the insufflation of a mixture of up to 0.8 O2 as a fraction of inspired air. The MakAir has undergone a complete pre-clinical evaluation on a test bench. The MakAir provides ventilation assistance as directed in simulated cases of acute respiratory failure linked in various resistance scenarios. Translated into a motive pressure of 10–15cmH2O, the driving pressure ventilation provides a good approximation of tidal volume. In the same way, the control of the oxygen supply by a flowmeter makes it possible to estimate the FiO2 in the different scenarios tested. The technical performance of the MakAir crisis ventilator is in accordance with the requirements applied to devices intended for commercial use. If the provision of sufficient equipment can only relieve over-stressed teams in times of crisis, the MakAir can be an interesting alternative for low- and middle-income countries. The open-source features of MakAir also make it possible to improve, develop, and test several technological and/or algorithmic improvements, or even to produce a local version.","Gourraud, Pierre-Antoine; Evenas, Mickaël; Lejus-Bourdeau, Corinne; Jamin, Baptiste; Moneyron, Gabriel; Adam, Quentin; Charbon, François; Guerin, Claude; Argaud, Laurent; Huneker, Erik; Julien, Marc; Rakotoarison, Nicole; Roquilly, Antoine; L’Her, Erwan",Médecine de Catastrophe - Urgences Collectives,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1279847920301129; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1279847920301129,427

The micturition reflex is one of the autonomic reflexes mediated by the spinobulbospinal reflex pathway that passes through the pontine micturition center. This reflex pathway is in turn modulated by higher centers in the cerebral cortex that are involved in the voluntary control of micturition. Due to the complexity of the neural control of lower urinary tract, micturition is sensitive to numerous injuries, such as spinal cord injury, cerebral infarction, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and spina bifida, which result in various types of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. Studies in animals for these diseases involved in the central nervous system indicate that the lower urinary tract dysfunction is dependent in part on plasticity of the neural pathways controlling the lower urinary tract. Reflex plasticity is also associated with changes in the properties of ion channels, receptors, and numerous mediators. These animal models may help to investigate the mechanism involved in the genesis of pathological conditions as well as the plasticity in reflex pathways to the lower urinary tract after neurogenic lesions.","Miyazato, Minoru; Kadekawa, Katsumi; Kitta, Takeya; Wada, Naoki; Shimizu, Nobutaka; de Groat, William C.; Birder, Lori A.; Kanai, Anthony J.; Saito, Seiichi; Yoshimura, Naoki",Urologic Clinics of North America,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094014317300320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28716328/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0094014317300320; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ucl.2017.04.014,427

SETTING: We conducted a survey in Wuhan, China, to characterize the status of coinfected PLWH, their time to clinical improvement, and clinical prognoses. METHODS: Using a Wuhan shipping service for antiretroviral medications, the Wuhan LGBT Center screened 2900 PLWH shipping addresses and cross-referenced 36 of them to quarantine sites or hospitals, suggesting possible COVID-19 cases. Through telephone calls and WeChat (social media) messaging, we conducted a survey after obtaining online informed consent. RESULTS: We had 12 HIV-infected respondents (10 men and 2 women) who also reported COVID-19. The median age was 36 years (interquartile range: 33.0–56.3), mean age 42.4 years, and range 25–66 years of age. Nine of 10 persons on antiretroviral therapy (ART) presented with only mild COVID-19 symptoms. The 10th person on ART was a 56-year-old man who died at home early in the outbreak when health care services were overwhelmed. Two additional cases who had been in intensive care with acute COVID-19 were both men, aged 25 and 37 years; both were ART-naive until this hospitalization. Excluding the deceased man, 6 of 11 coinfected persons reported feeling depressed even after clinical improvements. CONCLUSION: Twelve coinfected persons were identified in Wuhan; 9 of 10 were on long-term ART and had favorable outcomes. Two men identified as having started ART only recently were found to have severe symptoms.

METHODS: A cross-sectional internet-based study was conducted between June 20 and July 13, 2020. The questionnaires included the demographic information, COVID-19 related questions, Kasseler-10 to assess psychological distress level and Brief Resilient Coping Scale, and Oslo-3 social support scale questionnaire were employed. RESULTS: A total of 423 participants were involved in the study with a response rate of 100%. The mean age of respondents was 34.5 years (SD = ±8.45 years). The prevalence of psychological distress among participants was 42%. Of these 18%, 11%, and 13% had mild, moderate, and severe psychological distress levels. Being married, being nurses and pharmacies, current substance users, working in emergency and outpatient departments, history of chronic medical illness, brief resilient coping level, and social support level were particularly associated with high psychological distress. CONCLUSION: Health-care professionals are experiencing a substantial level of psychological distress. In addition to other modifying factors coping level and social support was a significant predictor of psychological distress among health-care professionals.

Several genera belong to this family, including the Hepacivirus genus, of which hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the prototype member, and the Flavivirus genus, which contains both dengue virus and Zika virus. Viruses of these genera differ in many respects, such as the mode of transmission or the course of infection, which is either predominantly persistent in the case of HCV or acutely self-limiting in the case of flaviviruses. Although the fundamental replication strategy of Flaviviridae members is similar, during the past few years, important differences have been discovered, including the way in which these viruses exploit cellular resources to facilitate viral propagation. These differences might be responsible, at least in part, for the various biological properties of these viruses, thus offering the possibility to learn from comparisons. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of how Flaviviridae viruses manipulate and usurp cellular pathways in infected cells. Specifically, we focus on comparing strategies employed by flaviviruses with those employed by hepaciviruses, and we discuss the importance of these interactions in the context of viral replication and antiviral therapies.

Efficient replication of the virus relies on the activity of nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1), a major virulence factor shown to facilitate suppression of host gene expression through promotion of host mRNA degradation and interaction with the 40S ribosomal subunit. Here, we report the crystal structure of the globular domain of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1, encompassing residues 13 to 127, at a resolution of 1.65 Å. Our structure features a six-stranded, capped β-barrel motif similar to Nsp1from SARS-CoV and reveals how variations in amino acid sequence manifest as distinct structural features. Through comparative analysis of structural homologues, we identified a topological signature associated with this protein fold that facilitated modeling of Nsp1 from MERS-CoV. Combining our high-resolution crystal structure with existing data on the C-terminus of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2, we propose a model of the full-length protein.

Though many patients seem to recover their sense of smell after a few weeks, a certain proportion of them seem to develop long-lasting olfactory disorder. Yet, as of October 2020, there is no recommended standardized treatment to reduce the risk of developing long-term olfactory disorder. In this pilot study, we investigated the efficacy and the safety of oral corticosteroids and olfactory training as a treatment for patients with persistent olfactory dysfunction as a result of COVID-19. METHODS: Non-hospitalized patients with a sudden loss of smell and a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were recruited by hospital call from February to April 2020. These participants were submitted to an extensive psychophysical testing in order to identify those with persistent dysosmia. Dysosmic patients were then treated either by a 10-day course of oral corticosteroids combined with olfactory training, or by olfactory training alone. All participants were subject to a second olfactory test after a mean of 10 weeks. RESULTS: 72 subjects with documented COVID-19 infection performed the initial olfactory test, on average 5 weeks after losing their sense of smell. Amongst them, 27 (37.5%) patients showed persistent dysosmia and were all included in this study. Nine participants received oral corticosteroids and performed olfactory training (OCS + OT), while 18 performed olfactory training (OT) only. Only participants in the OCS + OT group had significantly improved their olfactory score and did so above the minimal clinically important difference for subjective improvement of smell (p = 0.007). Three of the participants who received oral corticosteroids reported minimal and transient side effects. CONCLUSION: This pilot study may suggest the combination of a short course of oral corticosteroids and olfactory training is safe and may be beneficial in helping patients with enduring dysosmia recover from olfactory loss due to COVID-19. There is a crucial need for further investigation with larger cohorts to corroborate these findings.","Le Bon, Serge-Daniel; Konopnicki, Deborah; Pisarski, Nathalie; Prunier, Léa; Lechien, Jérôme R.; Horoi, Mihaela",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423106/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-020-06520-8,427

RESULTS: There was no significant difference in pass rates for both FFRs on initial fit testing, but subjects who passed were more likely to fail the postexercise test with N95 FFRs (P = .01). Wearing FFRs increased the temperature of facial skin covered by the FFR (P = .009) and breathing discomfort (P = .002). No significant differences were noted in other measured variables (heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, transcutaneous carbon dioxide level, rectal temperature, global skin temperature, core temperature, and subjective perceptions) between controls and FFRs and between FFR models. CONCLUSION: After 1 hour of exercise in hot, humid ambient conditions, P100 FFRs retained better fit than N95 FFRs, without additional physiologic or subjective impact. Wearing FFRs under these conditions does not add to the body's thermophysiologic or perceptual burdens.","Kim, Jung-Hyun; Wu, Tianzhou; Powell, Jeffrey B.; Roberge, Raymond J.",Am J Infect Control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2015.08.027; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019665531500944X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26476496/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019665531500944X,427
624696,Smart City Data Sensing during COVID-19: Public Reaction to Accelerating Digital Transformation,2021-06-08,"BACKGROUND: A new technology in cancer treatment, the MR-linac, provides online magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) that combines real-time visualization of the tumor and surrounding tissue with radiation therapy to deliver treatment more accurately. Online MRgRT makes it possible to minimize treatment volume, potentially reducing acute treatment toxicity. Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) add the patient perspective to evaluating treatment toxicity related to new technology. The objective of this mixed-methods study was to develop and explore the content validity of a set of PRO items to evaluate acute pelvic toxicity to radiotherapy including online MRgRT. METHODS: A literature review and chart audit were conducted to identify symptomatic adverse events (AEs) to be selected from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) library and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) item library. To validate the content, the item set was applied in a prospective pilot cohort of patients referred for primary pelvic RT with curative intent. Patients reported symptoms weekly during RT (4–8 weeks) and the subsequent 4 weeks. Follow-up reports were collected at 8, 12, and 24 weeks after RT. To ensure symptom coverage clinician-reported toxicity and individual patient interviews were conducted. The symptomatic AEs were included in the final item set if ≥20% of patients reported them. RESULTS: Eighteen acute symptomatic AEs were selected for the initial item set. Forty patients (32 prostate cancer, 8 cervical cancer) were included in the pilot study. Patients with prostate cancer and those with cervical cancer both reported all 18 acute AEs. However, vomiting was not reported by > 20% of patients thus excluded from the item set. Adding a few diagnosis-specific AEs to the final item set was required for both prostate and cervical cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: A PRO item set for patients with pelvic cancer treated with radiotherapy with a curative intent was developed and content validity explored. In the pilot study, the item set captured the most common acute symptomatic AEs for patients with prostate and cervical cancer related to pelvic RT including online MRgRT. Further validation of the content in broader disease sites would be needed in future studies.

Methods This was a cross-sectional study based on data retrieved for 204 patients admitted to the ICU of Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar, Pakistan, from April to August 2020. Study variables were age, gender, co-morbid conditions, ventilatory status, and length of stay (LOS). The data were analyzed using SPSS version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The independent t-test and the chi-square test were used to compare the means and frequencies of variables. Multivariate regression analysis was used to predict the likelihood of mortality. Results The overall mortality was 77%. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was administered to 61.8% of patients. Mortality was higher for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (93.6% vs 66.7%, p<0.001) and for over 60 years (87.3% vs 72.3%, p=0.019). Mortality without co-morbidities was 75.2%. Comparative mortality rates for at least one co-morbidity (79.7%), diabetes mellitus (80.0%), hypertension (100%), diabetes mellitus and hypertension both (87.1%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (75%) were insignificant. The LOS for survivors was longer (8.9±8.9 versus 5.4±5.2 days, p=0.017). The LOS < 24h was associated with higher mortality (85.9% vs 72.9%, p=0.040). On multivariable regression, the likelihood of mortality was high for IMV (7.330, 95% CI 2.667 - 20.143, p<0.001) and elderly (>60 years) patients (2.607, 95%CI 1.063 - 6.394, p=0.036). Mortality decreased with LOS longer than 24h (0.412, 95%CI 0.173 - 0.982, p=0.045). Co-morbidities did not have any effect on mortality. Conclusions Age more than 60 years and IMV were independent risk factors for higher mortality. Longer ICU stay, specifically more than 24 hours, was associated with lower mortality but LOS less than 24 hours might not have a causal relationship with mortality. The odds of survival were not affected by co-morbidities.","Rahim, Fawad; Amin, Said; Noor, Mohammad; Bahadur, Sher; Gul, Huma; Mahmood, Afsheen; Usman, Muhammad; Khan, Muhammad Asif; Ullah, Raza; Shahab, Khalid",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194473/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10906,427

Methods: Twelve-year health trajectories were identified in subjects from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (N=3108), integrating five indicators of disease, physical and cognitive function, and disability through nominal response models. Growth mixture models were applied to explore health trajectories in terms of rate and pattern of change. Baseline information about health-related behaviors and the social context was collected through standardized questionnaires. The strength of the associations was estimated using logistic regression, and their impact through population attributable fractions (PAF). Results: Three trajectories were identified grouping 78%, 18%, and 4% of people with respectively increasing rates of health decline. Compared to the best trajectory, subjects in the middle and worst trajectories became functionally dependent 12.0 (95% CI: 11.4-12.6) and 12.1 (95% CI: 11.5-12.7) years earlier, respectively. Insufficient physical activity (OR: 3.38, 95% CI: 2.58-4.42), financial strain (OR: 2.76, 95% CI: 1.77-4.30), <12 years education (OR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.14-2.04), low social connections (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.09-1.94), low social participation (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.06-1.83) and a body mass index ≥25 (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.03-1.75) were associated with belonging to the middle/worst trajectories. The highest PAFs were observed for insufficient physical activity (27.1%), low education (19.3%) and low social participation (15.9%); a total PAF of 66.1% was obtained. Conclusions: Addressing the social determinants of health in its broadest sense, complementarily considering life-long factors belonging to the socioeconomic, psychosocial, and behavioral dimensions, should be central to any strategy aimed at fostering health in older age.","Calderón-Larrañaga, Amaia; Hu, Xiaonan; Haaksma, Miriam; Rizzuto, Debora; Fratiglioni, Laura; Vetrano, Davide L.",Aging (Albany NY),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34383709/; https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.203407,427
627020,The role of philosophy in the pandemic era,2020-09-01,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 response required the cancellation of all but the most urgent surgical procedures. The number of cancelled surgical procedures in the National Health Service (NHS) England due to COVID-19, and the reintroduction of surgical activity, was modelled. MethodsModelling study using Hospital Episode Statistics data (2014-2019). Using NHS England definitions, surgical procedures were grouped into four urgency classes. Expected numbers of surgical procedures performed between 1st March 2020 and 28th February 2021 were modelled. Procedure deficit was estimated using conservative assumptions and the gradual reintroduction of elective surgery from the 1st June 2020. Costs were calculated using NHS reference costs and are reported as millions(M) or billions(B) of Euros({euro}). Estimates are reported with 95% confidence intervals. Results4 547 534 (3 318 195 - 6 250 771) patients with pooled mean age of 53.5 years were expected to undergo surgery between 1st March 2020 and 28th February 2021. By 31st May 2020, 749 247 (513 564 - 1 077 448) surgical procedures were cancelled. Assuming elective surgery is gradually reintroduced, 2 328 193 (1 483 834 - 3 450 043) patients will be awaiting surgery by 28th February 2021. The cost of delayed procedures is {euro}5.3B ({euro}3.1B - {euro}8.0B). Safe delivery of surgery during the pandemic will require substantial extra resources costing {euro}526.8M ({euro}449.6M - {euro}633.9M). ConclusionReintroduction of elective surgery in NHS England will be associated with substantial treatment delays, and large cost increases. The challenges and costs of reintroducing surgical care in other healthcare settings may differ and further research to monitor the recovery of surgical care is urgently required.","Fowler, Alexander J; Dobbs, Tom D; Wan, Yize I; Laloo, Ryan; Hui, Sarah; Nepogodiev, Dmitri; Bhangu, Aneel; Whitaker, Iain; Pearse, Rupert M; Abbott, Tom EF",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.10.20127266v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.10.20127266,427
627250,Evidence-Based Decision-Making for Nurse Leaders,2020-07-29,"The interferon-induced transmembrane proteins 1–3 (IFITM1–3) inhibit host cell entry of several viruses. However, it is incompletely understood how IFITM1–3 exert antiviral activity. Two phenylalanine residues, F75 and F78, within the intramembrane domain 1 (IM1) were previously shown to be required for IFITM3/IFITM3 interactions and for inhibition of viral entry, suggesting that IFITM/IFITM interactions might be pivotal to antiviral activity. Here, we employed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay to analyze IFITM/IFITM interactions. For assay calibration, we equipped two cytosolic, non-interacting proteins, super yellow fluorescent protein (SYFP) and super cyan fluorescent protein (SCFP), with signals that target proteins to membrane rafts and also analyzed a SCFP-SYFP fusion protein. This strategy allowed us to discriminate background signals resulting from colocalization of proteins at membrane subdomains from signals elicited by protein–protein interactions. Coexpression of IFITM1–3 and IFITM5 fused to fluorescent proteins elicited strong FRET signals, and mutation of F75 and F78 in IFITM3 (mutant IFITM3-FF) abrogated antiviral activity, as expected, but did not alter cellular localization and FRET signals. Moreover, IFITM3-FF co-immunoprecipitated efficiently with wild type (wt) IFITM3, lending further support to the finding that lack of antiviral activity of IFITM3-FF was not due to altered membrane targeting or abrogated IFITM3-IFITM3 interactions. Collectively, we report an assay that allows quantifying IFITM/IFITM interactions. Moreover, we confirm residues F75 and F78 as critical for antiviral activity but also show that these residues are dispensable for IFITM3 membrane localization and IFITM3/IFITM3 interactions.","Winkler, Michael; Wrensch, Florian; Bosch, Pascale; Knoth, Maike; Schindler, Michael; Gärtner, Sabine; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31398796/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20163859,427

Preliminary leaching is aimed to recover copper in the leachate that would compete with gold in the successive leaching of the residue with thiourea, thus preventing the formation of the gold-thiourea complex. Two hydrometallurgical routes were tested for the recovery of copper first, and gold after. The first one was based on a two-step leaching that utilizes sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide in the preliminary leaching and then thiourea for the recovery of gold in the successive leaching: A copper and gold recovery of 81% and 79% were obtained, respectively. In the second route, nitric acid was used: 100% of copper was recovered in the leachate and 85% of gold in the thiourea successive leaching. The main operative parameters, namely thiourea and ferric sulphate concentrations, leach time, liquid-solid ratio, and temperature were studied according to a factorial plan strategy. A flowsheet of the processes was proposed, and a mass balance of both routes was obtained. Finally, qualitative considerations on the technical and economic feasibility of the different routes were made.","Ippolito, Nicolò Maria; Medici, Franco; Pietrelli, Loris; Piga, Luigi",Materials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33450981/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ma14020362,427

Because progress toward clinical competence is linked to thinking, acting and feeling like a physician, a coach’s knowledge about a learner’s development of clinical skills is essential to promoting the learner’s professional identity formation. A longitudinal coaching program provides a foundation for the formation of coach-learner relationships built on trust. Trusting relationships can moderate the risk and vulnerability inherent in a hierarchical medical education system and allow coaching conversations to focus on the promotion of self-regulated learning and fostering skills for life-long learning.

In this context, in Italy, we reorganized the National Health System and prioritized the clinical cancer care scenario, balancing risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission versus the magnitude of clinical benefit deriving from a specific therapeutic approach. As initial actions, we recommended that routine screening be suspended and that patients with early and advanced cancer be treated as outpatients as much as possible and at the nearest medical center. Patients who need to be hospitalized for cancer treatment were protected from potential SARS‐CoV‐2 infection by creating a dedicated diagnostic and therapeutic internal pathway for cancer treatment. We implemented reorganization of the hospital networks, based on a hub‐and‐spoke design. Stronger personal protection was made available for patients with cancer. Because of the extreme burden created by COVID‐19, antitumor treatment was initiated only after considering patient performance status, comorbidities, biology of disease, and the likely impact of treatment on outcome.

Therefore, finding a symptom with a high predictive value would help in diagnostic and isolation strategies. Objective To correlate the sudden loss of the sense of smell in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic with results of diagnostic tests for COVID-19. Material and methods This is a cross-sectional observational study. An online questionnaire was digitally addressed to 725 outpatients in Brazil who reported partial or total sudden loss of the sense of smell from March to April 2020. Results Total or partial sudden loss of the sense of smell showed high Positive Predictive Value (PPV) for COVID-19 diagnosis, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil (88.8%). There were no differences between groups tested positive and negative in regard to demographic and clinical characteristics such as presence of allergy, rhinitis, neither to olfactory recovery time. Conclusion The identification of sudden loss of the sense of smell during COVID-19 pandemic may serve as a sentinel symptom and may be a warning to establish measures to prevent the transmission of the disease.","Joffily, Lucia; Ungierowicz, Aluan; David, Andrea Goldwasser; Melo, Bruna; Brito, César Leandro Terra; Mello, Luciane; Santos, Priscilla de Souza Campos dos; Pezato, Rogério",Braz J Otorhinolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32561220/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1808869420300604; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjorl.2020.05.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1808869420300604?v=s5,427

Digital health deployment of psychosocial interventions to support youth with chronic illness has become increasingly popular with the advent of the technological advances in the digital age. OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to systematically review published efficacy studies of eHealth and mHealth (mobile health) psychosocial interventions for youths with chronic illnesses and review intervention theory and treatment components. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for studies published from 2008 to 2019 of eHealth and mHealth psychosocial interventions designed for children and adolescents with chronic illnesses in which efficacy outcomes were reported. We excluded studies of interventions for caregivers, healthy youth, disease and medication management, and telehealth interventions that function solely as a platform to connect patients to providers via phone, text, or videoconference. RESULTS: We screened 2551 articles and 133 relevant full-text articles. Sixteen efficacy studies with psychosocial and health outcomes representing 12 unique interventions met the inclusion criteria. Of the included studies, 12 were randomized controlled trials and 4 were prospective cohort studies with no comparison group. Most interventions were based in cognitive behavioral theory and designed as eHealth interventions; only 2 were designed as mHealth interventions. All but 2 interventions provided access to support staff via text, phone, email, or discussion forums. The significant heterogeneity in intervention content, intervention structure, medical diagnoses, and outcomes precluded meta-analysis. For example, measurement time points ranged from immediately postcompletion of the mHealth program to 18 months later, and we identified 39 unique outcomes of interest. The majority of included studies (11/16, 69%) reported significant changes in measured health and/or psychosocial posttreatment outcomes, with small to large effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Although the available literature on the efficacy of eHealth and mHealth psychosocial interventions for youth with chronic illnesses is limited, preliminary research suggests some evidence of positive treatment responses. Future studies should continue to evaluate whether digital health platforms may be a viable alternative model of delivery to traditional face-to-face approaches.","Lau, Nancy; Waldbaum, Shayna; Parigoris, Ryan; O'Daffer, Alison; Walsh, Casey; Colt, Susannah F; Yi-Frazier, Joyce P; Palermo, Tonya M; McCauley, Elizabeth; Rosenberg, Abby R",JMIR Pediatr Parent,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33075743/; https://doi.org/10.2196/22329,427

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the novel coronavirus disease-19. Downregulation of ACE2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of severe lung failure after viral or bacterial infections. The aim of the present study was to examine the anti-inflammatory mechanism through which APC alleviates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in vivo and in vitro. The present results demonstrated that LPS significantly downregulated the expression of ACE2, while APC significantly reduced LPS-induced ALI and provided beneficial effects. In addition, bioinformatics analysis indicated that microRNA (miR)-200c-3p directly targeted the 3'untranslated region of ACE2 and regulated the expression of ACE2 protein. LPS exposure inhibited the expression of ACE2 protein in A549 cells by upregulating the levels of miR-200c-3p. However, APC inhibited the upregulation of miR-200c-3p induced by LPS, as well as the downregulation of ACE2 protein, through the NF-κB pathway. In conclusion, although LPS can inhibit the expression of ACE2 by upregulating the levels of miR-200c-3p through the NF-κB pathway, APC inhibited this effect, thus reducing inflammation during LPS-induced ALI.","Yu, Guiyuan; Jiao, Yan; Huang, Jia-Jia; Fan, Ming-Da; Hao, Yu-Chen; Han, Ji-Zhong; Qu, Liangchao",Exp Ther Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33747178/; https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2021.9879,427

The design addresses potential ventilator shortages resulting from the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic, or future pandemics by converting a positive pressure source into a mechanical ventilator with a part that is (i) inexpensive, (ii) easily manufactured without the need for specialized equipment, (iii) simple to assemble and maintain, (iv) does not require any electronics, and (v) has no moving components that could be prone to failure. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is used to assess flow characteristics of the system, and a prototype is developed and tested with a commercial benchtop respiratory stimulator. The simulations show clinically relevant periodic oscillation with outlet pressures in the range of 8‐20 cmH(2)O and end‐user‐tunable frequencies in the range of 3‐6 seconds (respiratory rate (RR) of 10‐20 breaths per minute). The prototype can respond to disrupted oscillations, an analogue for patient‐initiated breaths. The fluidic oscillator presented here functions at physiologically‐relevant pressures and frequencies, demonstrating potential as a low‐cost, readily deployable means for converting CPAP machines into emergency use ventilators.

METHODS: An institutional review board–approved, cross‐sectional survey of a non‐probability sample from Amazon Mechanical Turk was administered May 24–25, 2020. Change in self‐reported willingness to use an ED before and during the pandemic (primary outcome) was assessed via McNemar's test; COVID‐19 knowledge and perceptions were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: There were 855 survey participants (466 [54.5%] male; 699 [81.8%] White; median age 39). Proportion reporting likelihood to use the ED pre‐pandemic (71% [604/855]) decreased significantly during the pandemic (49% [417/855]; P < 0.001); those unlikely to visit the ED increased significantly during the pandemic (41% [347/855] vs 22% [417/855], P < 0.001). Participants were unlikely to use the ED during the pandemic if they were unlikely to use it pre‐pandemic (adjusted odds ratio, 4.55; 95% confidence interval, 3.09–6.7) or correctly answered more COVID‐19 knowledge questions (adjusted odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–1.60). Furthermore, 23.4% (n = 200) of respondents believed the pandemic was not a serious threat to society. Respondents with higher COVID‐19 knowledge scores were more likely to view the pandemic as serious (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–1.82).

Patients with reinfection were either seronegative (2/56, n = 3.6%), seroreverted (2/137, 1.5%), or seropositive (2/353, 0.6%) (p = 0.085). All reinfections were mild (n = 5) or asymptomatic (n = 1). After reinfection, none of patients developed IgM response and only two had a transitory boosted IgG immunization response. In an unselected population after the first wave of COVID-19, after a prolonged observation period (mean 10 months), reinfection was very uncommon; occurred in patients with a previous history of mild infection, mostly with weak or absent serological response; and manifested with mild or asymptomatic clinical presentation.","Peghin, Maddalena; Bouza, Emilio; Fabris, Martina; De Martino, Maria; Palese, Alvisa; Bontempo, Giulia; Graziano, Elena; Gerussi, Valentina; Bressan, Valentina; Sartor, Assunta; Isola, Miriam; Tascini, Carlo; Curcio, Francesco",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-021-04335-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34378086/,427

This study included 104 dairy operations in 13 states that participated in the National Animal Health Monitoring System's Dairy 2014 calf component study. This 18-mo longitudinal study focused on dairy heifer calves from birth to weaning, and data were collected on 2,545 heifer calves. Descriptive statistics were generated regarding colostrum feeding, preweaning housing, milk feeding and consumption, growth, morbidity and mortality, and weaning practices. The majority of calves enrolled were Holsteins (89.4%). Over half the calves (63.2%) enrolled in the study received the majority of their colostrum via bottle; however, 22.1% of calves from 51.0% of operations received colostrum via suckling from their dams. For all calves, the mean time to the first colostrum feeding was 2.8 h, and the average amount of colostrum at the first feeding was 2.9 L, with 4.5 L provided in the first 24 h. The mean serum IgG of all calves was 21.7 g/L; however, 76.0% of operations had at least 1 calf with failure of passive transfer of immunity with a serum IgG below 10 g/L. The majority of calves in the study were housed individually (86.6%). Nonetheless, 20.2% of operations housed some calves in groups, representing 13.4% of all calves. Approximately one-half of the calves in the study (52.3%) were dehorned or disbudded during the preweaning period, with only 27.8% of these calves receiving analgesics or anesthetics during the procedure. Whole or waste milk was the liquid diet type fed to 40.1% of calves, and milk replacer was fed to 34.8% of calves. A combination of milk and milk replacer was fed to 25.1% of calves. Calves, on average, were fed 2.6 L per feeding and fed 2.6 times/d, resulting in a total of 5.6 L of liquid diet fed per day. The mean average daily gain for all calves enrolled in the study was 0.7 kg/d. Fecal samples were collected and almost all operations had at least 1 calf positive for Cryptosporidium (94.2%) or Giardia (99.0%), and 84.6% of operations had calves that tested positive for both Cryptosporidium and Giardia. Over one-third of calves (38.1%) had at least one morbidity event during the preweaning period and the mortality rate was 5.0%. The mean age at weaning was 65.7 d. This study provides an update on dairy heifer raising practices in the United States.","Urie, N.J.; Lombard, J.E.; Shivley, C.B.; Kopral, C.A.; Adams, A.E.; Earleywine, T.J.; Olson, J.D.; Garry, F.B.",J Dairy Sci,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-14010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29908815/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030218305666; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030218305666,427

Many recommendations for the composition and sequence of the 3′ end have been suggested based on theoretical considerations, but have not been verified experimentally. We analyzed 3′ end triplets of PCR primer sequences obtained from refereed journal articles, to test those recommendations and to make empirical recommendations for primer design. The frequencies of the 64 possible 3′end triplets among 2137 PCR primers from the VirOligo database were not uniformly distributed. From the analysis, we found that unfavored and preferred 3′ end triplets existed, and that the apparent preferences were not due to base compositions in viral genome sequences. Comparison of the sequences preferred by practitioners to those recommended, suggested that no single recommendation is entirely satisfactory. We suggest that recommendations be replaced with a scoring system incorporating empirical frequencies such as those reported here.","Onodera, Kenji; Melcher, Ulrich",Mol Cell Probes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890850804000520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15488375/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890850804000520,427

METHODS: Two investigators searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, MedRxiv, and ChinaXiv databases for articles published through March 30, 2020. Retrospective studies assessing the relationship between the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and levels of troponin I (TnI) and other cardiac injury biomarkers (creatine kinase [CK], CK myocardial band [CK-MB], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were included. The data were extracted independently by two investigators. RESULTS: The analysis included 23 studies with 4631 total individuals. The proportions of severe disease, ICU admission, or death among patients with non-elevated TnI (or troponin T [TnT]), and those with elevated TnI (or TnT) were 12.0% and 64.5%, 11.8% and 56.0%, and 8.2% and. 59.3%, respectively. Patients with elevated TnI levels had significantly higher risks of severe disease, ICU admission, and death (RR 5.57, 95% CI 3.04 to 10.22, P < 0.001; RR 6.20, 95% CI 2.52 to 15.29, P < 0.001; RR 5.64, 95% CI 2.69 to 11.83, P < 0.001). Patients with an elevated CK level were at significantly increased risk of severe disease or ICU admission (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.50 to 2.61, P < 0.001). Patients with elevated CK-MB levels were at a higher risk of developing severe disease or requiring ICU admission (RR 3.24, 95% CI 1.66 to 6.34, P = 0.001). Patients with newly occurring arrhythmias were at higher risk of developing severe disease or requiring ICU admission (RR 13.09, 95% CI 7.00 to 24.47, P < 0.001). An elevated IL-6 level was associated with a higher risk of developing severe disease, requiring ICU admission, or death. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with elevated TnI levels are at significantly higher risk of severe disease, ICU admission, and death. Elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and IL-6 levels and emerging arrhythmia are associated with the development of severe disease and need for ICU admission, and the mortality is significantly higher in patients with elevated LDH and IL-6 levels.

The remarkable decline in the pollution-mortality relationship in Hong Kong,2020-03-05,"INTRODUCTION: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends prompt postpartum follow-up. However, 40% of women do not attend postpartum visits. These rates are lower in populations with limited resources. In response, the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Science in the Mount Sinai Health System created a postpartum follow-up phone call project that utilized medical students and was conducted at three health system hospitals from April 6 to May 30, 2020. METHODS: The number of patients contacted by medical students within 72 hours of hospital discharge was recorded. Students at two of the three sites also recorded the number of patients who needed (1) urgent evaluation and subsequent hospital readmission, (2) medications prescribed, and (3) referral for social work services. Students completed questionnaires at the project beginning and end regarding confidence in rendering of postpartum care. Confidence level was based on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not confident at all, 5 = very confident). RESULTS: Nine students participated. Overall, confidence on providing postpartum care significantly increased from 2.2 to 3.7 (p < .001). Three hundred eighty-seven patients were contacted. Four patients were advised to return to the hospital emergently; two were readmitted. Forty-seven patients needed medication prescribed. Two patients were referred for social work services. DISCUSSION: Our medical student–driven postpartum follow-up phone call project was associated with a high number of patients called and management of significant postpartum issues. Students’ confidence in managing postpartum issues was significantly higher after versus before project participation.","Abraham, Cynthia",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,https://doi.org/10.15766/mep_2374-8265.11109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33644306/,427

One key change is media intake, as many individuals reported an increase in media consumption during the COVID-19 lockdown. Specifically, social media and television usage increased. In this regard, the present study examines social TV viewing, the simultaneous use of watching TV while communicating with others about the TV content on various communication technologies, during the COVID-19 lockdown. An online survey was conducted to collect data from college students in the United States during the COVID-19 lockdown. Primary results indicate that different motives predict different uses of communication platforms for social TV engagement, such as public platforms, text-based private platforms, and video-based private platforms. Specifically, the social motive significantly predicts social TV engagement on most of the platforms. Further, the study finds that social presence of virtual co-viewers mediates the relationship between social TV engagement and social TV enjoyment. Overall, the study's findings provide a meaningful understanding of social TV viewing when physical social gatherings are restricted.","Kim, Jihyun; Merrill Jr., Kelly; Collins, Chad; Yang, Hocheol",Technol Soc,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160791X21002086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34538985/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X21002086; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101733,427

Here, an attempt has been made through in-silico high throughput screening to explore the antiviral compounds from traditionally used plants for antiviral treatments in India namely, Tea, Neem and Turmeric, as potential inhibitors of two widely studied viral proteases, main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) of the SARS-CoV-2. Molecular docking study using BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2018 revealed, (−)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate (ECG), a tea polyphenol has a binding affinity toward both the selected receptors, with the lowest CDocker energy − 46.22 kcal mol(−1) for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and CDocker energy − 44.72 kcal mol(−1) for SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complexed with (−)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate, which had shown the best binding affinity was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to validate its binding affinity, during which, the root-mean-square-deviation values of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro–Co-crystal ligand (N3) and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro- (−)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate systems were found to be more stable than SARS-CoV-2 Mpro system.

We aimed to compare the risk of death between COVID-19-related ARDS patients with corticosteroid treatment and those without. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective observational study, patients with ARDS caused by COVID-19 between January 20, 2020, and February 24, 2020, were enrolled. The primary outcome was 60-day in-hospital death. The exposure was prescribed systemic corticosteroids or not. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 60-day in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 382 patients [60.7 ± 14.1 years old (mean ± SD), 61.3% males] were analyzed. The median of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was 2.0 (IQR 2.0–3.0). Of these cases, 94 (24.6%) patients had invasive mechanical ventilation. The number of patients received systemic corticosteroids was 226 (59.2%), and 156 (40.8%) received standard treatment. The maximum dose of corticosteroids was 80.0 (IQR 40.0–80.0) mg equivalent methylprednisolone per day, and duration of corticosteroid treatment was 7.0 (4.0–12.0) days in total. In Cox regression analysis using corticosteroid treatment as a time-varying variable, corticosteroid treatment was associated with a significant reduction in risk of in-hospital death within 60 days after adjusting for age, sex, SOFA score at hospital admission, propensity score of corticosteroid treatment, comorbidities, antiviral treatment, and respiratory supports (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.21, 0.85; p = 0.0160). Corticosteroids were not associated with delayed viral RNA clearance in our cohort. CONCLUSION: In this clinical practice setting, low-dose corticosteroid treatment was associated with reduced risk of in-hospital death within 60 days in COVID-19 patients who developed ARDS.","Wu, Chaomin; Hou, Dongni; Du, Chunling; Cai, Yanping; Zheng, Junhua; Xu, Jie; Chen, Xiaoyan; Chen, Cuicui; Hu, Xianglin; Zhang, Yuye; Song, Juan; Wang, Lu; Chao, Yen-cheng; Feng, Yun; Xiong, Weining; Chen, Dechang; Zhong, Ming; Hu, Jie; Jiang, Jinjun; Bai, Chunxue; Zhou, Xin; Xu, Jinfu; Song, Yuanlin; Gong, Fengyun",Crit Care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-020-03340-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33172477/,427

Cigarette smoking (CS) is the leading cause of pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. Chronic CS leads to upregulation of bronchial ACE2 inducing a high vulnerability in COVID-19 smoker patients. Interestingly, CS-induced dysregulation of pulmonary renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in part contributing into the potential pathogenesis COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since, CS-mediated ACE2 activations is not the main pathway for increasing the risk of COVID-19, it appeared that AngII/AT1R might induce an inflammatory-burst in COVID-19 response by up-regulating cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4), which hydrolyses specifically the second intracellular messenger 3’, 5’-cyclic AMP (cAMP). It must be pointed out that CS might induce PDE4 up-regulation similarly to the COVID-19 inflammation, and therefore could potentiate COVID-19 inflammation opening the potential therapeutic effects of PDE4 inhibitor in both COVID-19-inflammation and CS.","Lugnier, Claire; AL-Kuraishi, Hayder M.; Rousseau, Eric",Biochem Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2021.114431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33515531/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295221000277?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006295221000277,427
635993,COVID‐19 disease causes an energy supply deficit in a patient,2020-09-29,"The current situation around coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) portrays a threat to us in several ways: It imposes uncertainty and a lack of control and reminds us of our own mortality. People around the world have reacted to these threats in seemingly unrelated ways: From stockpiling yeast and toilet paper to favoring nationalist ideas or endorsing conspiratorial beliefs. According to the General Process Model of Threat and Defense, the confrontation with a threat – a discrepant experience – makes humans react with both proximal and distal threat responses. While the proximal response manifests in behavioral inhibition that leads to heightened anxious arousal and vigilance, distal responses seek to lower behavioral inhibition and the associated state of anxiety and vigilance through engaging in distal defenses. In the present research, we propose that the reactions to COVID-19 may represent distal defense strategies to the pandemic and, therefore, can be explained and forecasted by the model. Thus, we hypothesized increased perceived COVID-19 threat to lead to a proximal threat response in the form of heightened behavioral inhibition. This, in return, should enhance the use of distal defenses (i.e., several ingroup biases, system justification, and conspiratorial beliefs) overlapping with the reactions observed as a response to COVID-19. This hypothesized mediated effect of increased perceived COVID-19 threat on distal defenses was tested in two preregistered studies: In Study 1 (N = 358), results showed perceived COVID-19 threat to be related to behavioral inhibition and, in turn, to be associated with increased distal defenses (i.e., higher entitativity, control restoration motivation, passive party support). In Study 2 (N = 348), we manipulated COVID-19 threat salience and found results suggesting the distal defenses of ingroup entitativity, system justification, and conspiratorial beliefs to be mediated by the proximal threat response. The results of the present research hint toward a common mechanism through which the seemingly unrelated reactions to COVID-19 can be explained. The results might help to predict future behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic and to design measures to counteract the detrimental effects of the pandemic.","Jutzi, Chiara A.; Willardt, Robin; Schmid, Petra C.; Jonas, Eva",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33101147/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.578586,427

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic health records of patients hospitalized within a 13-hospital New Jersey USA network between March 1, 2020 and April 22, 2020 with positive polymerase chain reaction results for SARS-CoV-2, with follow-up through May 29, 2020. With death or hospital discharge by day 40 as the primary endpoint, we used univariate followed by stepwise multivariate proportional hazard models to develop a risk score on one-half the data set, validated on the remainder, and converted the risk score into a patient-level predictive probability of 40-day mortality based on the combined dataset. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 3123 hospitalized COVID-19 patients; median age 63 years; 60% were men; 42% had >3 coexisting conditions. 713 (23%) patients died within 40 days of hospitalization for COVID-19. From 22 potential candidate factors 6 were found to be independent predictors of mortality and were included in the risk score model: age, respiratory rate ≥25/minute upon hospital presentation, oxygenation <94% on hospital presentation, and pre-hospital comorbidities of hypertension, coronary artery disease, or chronic renal disease. The risk score was highly prognostic of mortality in a training set and confirmatory set yielding in the combined dataset a hazard ratio of 1.80 (95% CI, 1.72, 1.87) for one unit increases. Using observed mortality within 20 equally sized bins of risk scores, a predictive model for an individual’s 40-day risk of mortality was generated as -14.258 + 13.460*RS + 1.585*(RS–2.524)^2–0.403*(RS–2.524)^3. An online calculator of this 40-day COVID-19 mortality risk score is available at www.HackensackMeridianHealth.org/CovidRS.

Pigs in groups A and B were challenged 21 days after the second immunisation of the group A animals. Following challenge, three pigs given rGP5 exhibited more severe clinical signs than the positive controls, including respiratory distress and progressive weight-loss. Although not statistically significant, the more severe disease exhibited by group A animals may suggest previous immunisation as a contributory factor.

Here, we demonstrate subcutaneous (SC) prime and SC boost vaccination of CD-1 mice with this dual-antigen vaccine elicits T-helper cell 1 (Th1) biased T-cell and humoral responses to both S and N that are greater than those seen with hAd5 S wild type delivering only unmodified S. We then compared SC to intranasal (IN) prime vaccination with SC or IN boosts and show that an IN prime with an IN boost is as effective at generating Th1 biased humoral responses as the other combinations tested, but an SC prime with an IN or SC boost elicits greater T cell responses. Finally, we used a combined SC plus IN (SC + IN) prime with or without a boost and found the SC + IN prime alone to be as effective in generating humoral and T-cell responses as the SC + IN prime with a boost. The finding that SC + IN prime-only delivery has the potential to provide broad immunity—including mucosal immunity—against SARS-CoV-2 supports further testing of this vaccine and delivery approach in animal models of viral challenge.","Rice, Adrian; Verma, Mohit; Shin, Annie; Zakin, Lise; Sieling, Peter; Tanaka, Shiho; Balint, Joseph; Dinkins, Kyle; Adisetiyo, Helty; Morimoto, Brett; Higashide, Wendy; Anders Olson, C.; Mody, Shivani; Spilman, Patricia; Gabitzsch, Elizabeth; Safrit, Jeffrey T.; Rabizadeh, Shahrooz; Niazi, Kayvan; Soon-Shiong, Patrick",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-94364-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34290317/,427
637654,A novel hybrid fuzzy time series model for prediction of COVID-19 infected cases and deaths in India,2021-07-06,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is challenging the dental community to an unprecedented degree. Knowledge of the increased risk of infection in dental settings has been disseminated to the public and guidelines have been formulated to assist dental attendance decision-making. However, dental attendance behaviors incompatible with treatment need is not uncommon in clinical settings. Important gaps remain in the knowledge about how psychological factors are affecting dental attendance behaviors during the COVID-19 epidemic. In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire survey was performed during February and March 2020. A total of 342 and 294 dental patients who attended and avoided dental visits, respectively, were included. The participants were classified into four groups based on dental attendance behavior and emergent/urgent dental treatment need. Bivariate analysis was performed to investigate factors associated with dental attendance. Multivariable logistic regression based on principal component scores was performed to identify major psychological constructs associated with unnecessary dental avoidance and attendance. Among all the factors explored, inability to wear masks during dental treatment (P < 0.001; effect size: 0.32) was most closely associated with the overall pattern of dental attendance among participants. Multivariable regression suggested that unnecessary dental avoidance was associated with perceived risk of infection in general and in dental settings (odds ratio [95% CI]: 0.62 [0.53, 0.72]; p < 0.001), perceived impact of COVID-19 and dental problems on general health (0.79 [0.65, 0.97]; 0.021), and personal traits such as trust and anxiety (0.77 [0.61, 0.98]; 0.038). Unnecessary dental attendance was associated with optimism toward the epidemic (1.68 [1.42, 2.01]; <0.001) and trust (1.39 [1.13, 1.74]; 0.002). Multidisciplinary efforts involving dental and medical professionals as well as psychologists are warranted to promote more widespread adoption, among the general public, of dental attendance behaviors compatible with dental treatment need during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Wen, Yi Feng; Fang, Peng; Peng, Jia-xi; Wu, Shengjun; Liu, Xufeng; Dong, Qian Qian",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34122203/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.555613,427
637943,Investigation of the Plasmodium falciparum Food Vacuole through Inducible Expression of the Chloroquine Resistance Transporter (PfCRT),2012-06-13,"INTRODUCTION: The early identification and access to health care of toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) – or at risk of developing it – is a crucial public health issue, as care and intervention may be more effective in younger children in order to improve their development and prognosis. However, there are still disparities in identification and health care access for children with ASD despite better screening methods. Given that misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are often due to the cultural gap between clinician and patient in some psychiatric disorders such as depression or schizophrenia, we examined this question concerning ASD and wondered to what extent ethno-cultural or migratory status might have an impact on the age at which a child is diagnosed. The only published review looking for independent factors influencing age of diagnosis concludes that the factors that have been proved to play a role are: socioeconomic status; symptom severity; level of parental concern, and family interactions with the health and education systems prior to diagnosis. The impact of ethno-cultural or migratory status is less clear. And yet, all these factors may be interconnected: migrants have on average a lower socioeconomic status, minorities don’t have the same access to health care, and cultural background can have an influence on what is expected of a child's development and health. In order to try and clarify this issue and to analyze the way in which the international literature approaches the subject, we carried out a systematic review. METHOD: Six databases were interrogated: Pubmed, Embase, Psychinfo, WebOfScience, Cochrane and Cinahl using the key words “ASD”, “pervasive developmental disorder”, “diagnosis”, “age”, “migrant”, “ethnicity”, “cross cultural”. We narrowed neither the period of time not selected the articles by their method, as our objective was to collect the entirety of the articles written on the subject. We completed this review by including the pertinent references made in the articles. RESULTS: Twenty articles were included, all epidemiological and observational, about children diagnosed in specialized centers. Published between 2002 and 2019, they cover a 20-year research period, between 1992 and 2016. The methods are disparate: the diagnosis criteria used are from DSM IV, IV TR and ICD; data originate from medical records, phone or internet surveys, and Medicaid healthcare claims. Comparison of the age at diagnosis is the principal objective for only thirteen studies; statistical data analyses vary, especially concerning adjustments. Seventy-five percent of the articles originate from North America where the compared populations are defined by ethnic and racial categories that are not used in some other countries, notably in Europe. Only five explore the link between migratory status and age at diagnosis. The research results concerning the impact of ethnicity are contradictory, while those concerning migratory status seem to indicate that migrant children are likely to be diagnosed later. But the articles and their methods being too heterogeneous, it was difficult to make a meta-analysis and impossible to reach a scientific conclusion. CONCLUSION: Nevertheless, this review highlights the existence of a lot of confounding factors and raises many issues. It shows that the United States produces most of the studies whose conclusions cannot be generalized because of the particular history and organization of this country. In Europe, where belonging to minority groups is thought to be through migratory status, studies are rare. There is an urgent need for new research in order to clarify the connection between migratory status and socioeconomic factors, to precisely define the independent variables influencing diagnosis -such as access to healthcare- and finally to explore the possibility of different symptomatic expressions depending on cultural backgrounds. This review falls within studies currently carried out by the psychiatric service at Avicenne hospital in Bobigny, France about ASD in a transcultural context.","Martinot, M.; Giacobi, C.; De Stefano, C.; Rezzoug, D.; Baubet, T.; Klein, A.",Encephale,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620301950; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013700620301950,427

Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: All healthcare workers and administrative personnel at the seven hospitals, pre-hospital services and specialist practitioner clinics in the Central Denmark Region were invited by e-mail to be tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by a commercial SARS-CoV-2 total antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Participants: A total of 25,950 participants were invited. Of these, 17,987 (69%) showed up for blood sampling, and 17,971 had samples available for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Main outcome measures: 1) Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; 2) Risk factors for seropositivity; 3) Association of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies. Results: After adjustment for assay sensitivity and specificity, the overall seroprevalence was 3.4% (CI: 2.5%-3.8%). The seroprevalence was higher in the western part of the region than in the eastern part (11.9% vs 1.2%, difference: 10.7 percentage points, CI: 9.5-12.2). In the high prevalence area, the emergency departments had the highest seroprevalence (29.7%) while departments without patients or with limited patient contact had the lowest seroprevalence (2.2%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis with age, sex, and profession as the predictors showed that nursing staff, medical doctors, and biomedical laboratory scientists had a higher risk than medical secretaries, who served as reference (OR = 7.3, CI: 3.5-14.9; OR = 4., CI: 1.8-8.9; and OR = 5.0, CI: 2.1-11.6, respectively). Among the total 668 seropositive participants, 433 (64.8%) had previously been tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and 50.0% had a positive RT-PCR result. A total of 98% of individuals who had a previous positive viral RNA test were also found to be seropositive. Conclusions: We found large differences in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in staff working in the healthcare sector within a small geographical area of Denmark and signs of in-hospital transmission. Half of all seropositive staff had been tested positive by PCR prior to this survey. This study raises awareness of precautions which should be taken to avoid in-hospital transmission. Additionally, regular testing of healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered to identify areas with increased transmission.

(1) There are no reports of lung transplantations to receipients with positive Covid-19-PCR at the time of the operation. Methods A 42-year-old woman without comorbidities was hospitalized and diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. After being intubated and tracheotomized, VV-ecmo support had to be initiated, no tendency of improvement ensued. Lung transplantation proceedings were made despite viral RNA test results from BAL being consistently positive (while negative culture growth suggested no active viral disease) since a small intracerebral bleeding had occurred after 45 days on ECMO. An adequate donor organ was found, double lung transplantation was performed. Two experienced anesthetists, two nurse anesthetists and a runner provided anesthesia. The OR was set to positive pressure and 26 air changes h-1, the team wore full PPE (multilayer gloves, gown/overall, FFP-3 masks, glasses, faceshield). Videolaryngoscopic intubation using a ViVaSight® (Ambu, Denmark) left double lumen tube with integrated camera was performed, TEE and bronchoscopy were avoided. We used near infrared spectropscopy and total intravenous anesthesia with Propofol 5,5mg kg-1 h-1 and Sufentanil 5mcg kg-1 h-1. Being on VV-Ecmo with 4,7l of blood and 5,5l O2 flow min-1 we used a second, centrally cannulated parallel ecmo circuit with 3l of blood and 2l of oxygen flow min-1, the VV circuit was reduced. The operation was prolonged due to adhesions, coagulopathy, rupture of the dilated right atrium. Transfusion of 30 units of packed red cells, 40 units of fresh frozen plasma, 5 units of platelets, 2000IE of PPSB, 30mcg of desmopressin acetate, 5 grams of fibrinogen concentrate guided by repetitive viscoelastic testing was performed. Bilateral pulmonary edema occurred, leading to an oxygenation index of 72 on 1l min-1 VV ecmo flow. We therefore switched to a femorally cannulated VA-ecmo circuit to minimize hemodynamic stress for the newly transplanted lungs. At the end of the operation the patient was stable with oxygenation index of 76 with 2,8l min-1 blood flow of ECMO support, sedated with Propofol 5,5mg kg-1 h-1 and Sufentanil 5mcg kg-1 h-1 and received Norepinephrine 0,06 mcg kg-1 min-1. We proned the patient immediately. COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction testing was performed in all team members and was negative in all cases. Results Discussion: Double lung transplantation is possible in selective patients suffering from COVID-19 pneumonia, intraoperative care is troublesome and strains resources due to open lung surgery and airway maneuvers increasing infection risk exponentially.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: : This prospective, cross-sectional, case-control study included 19 recovered COVID-19 paediatric patients and 20 healthy children. Macular thickness, choroidal thickness, vessel density (VD), perfusion density (PD), and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) values were obtained. Central vessel and perfusion densities were measured at the central 6-mm area, and the values were compared among three subgroups according to location. RESULTS: : The mean ages of patients and controls were 12.42 ± 3.3 years and 13.35 ± 1.2 years, respectively. Significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of inner, outer, and full VD, as well as inner and full PD. No significant differences in centre VD and PD were observed between groups. Although it was not evident in analysis of choroidal values, inflammatory sites were thickened. FAZ area significantly differed between groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: : Retinal microvascularity was impaired in the acute phase of disease in recovered COVID-19 patients aged 10–15 years. However, the microvascularity impairment was subclinical. The choroid was thickened because of inflammation during the acute phase of disease. Paediatric COVID-19 patients should undergo follow up via optical coherence tomography angiography to detect subclinical retinal changes.

As reported, the virus seems to less commonly infect children and causing less severe symptoms among infected children. This narrative review provides an inclusive view of scientific hypotheses, logical derivation, and early analyses that substantiate or refute such conjectures. At the completion of a relatively less restrictive search of this evolving topic, 13 articles—all published in 2020, were included in this early narrative review. Directional themes arising from the identified literature imply the potential relationship between childhood vaccination and COVID-19—either based on the potential genomic and immunological protective effects of heterologous immunity, or based on observational associations of cross-immunity among vaccines and other prior endemic diseases. Our review suggests that immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in children is different than in adults, resulting in differences in the levels of severity of symptoms and outcomes of the disease in different age groups. Further clinical investigations are warranted of at least three childhood vaccines: BCG, MMR, and HEP-A for their potential protective role against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Beric-Stojsic, Bojana; Kalabalik-Hoganson, Julie; Rizzolo, Denise; Roy, Sanjoy",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.587007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194993/,427

The current challenges the technology has for applicability in the fabrication of solid dosage forms include the limited range of suitable pharmaceutical grade thermoplastic materials. Hence, it is important to investigate the implications of variable properties of the polymeric carrier on the preparation steps and the final output, as versatile products could be obtained by using the same material. In this study, we highlighted the influence of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particle size on the residence time of the mixtures in the extruder during the drug-loaded filament preparation step and the consequent impact on drug release from the 3D printed dosage form. We enhanced filament printability by exploiting the plasticizing potential of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and we explored a channeled tablet model as a design strategy for dissolution facilitating purposes.

This literature review explores the published pre-registration MRS education curriculum adaptations implemented in response to the pandemic and effects of the adaptations on stakeholders. Key Findings Eleven articles were identified through a systematic literature search. The included articles covered the pre-registration MRS curriculum adaptations implemented in response to the pandemic in 12 countries of five continents. Through changing content delivery and assessment modes from face-to-face to online, non-practical classes and academic assessments could continue without significant interruptions. However, cancellation/postponement of practical classes and clinical placements was common during COVID-19 lockdown. Simulated learning was used by some institutions to replace some practical classes and placements. Among the stakeholders of MRS education (students, academics and clinical educators), the students were most affected. The main impacts were negative psychological effects and learning experiences. For the academics, they had common concerns about online learning quality and assessment integrity. Conclusion This review of the early publications in the first year of the pandemic provides an illustration of the MRS curriculum adaptations implemented in five continents covering both English and non-English speaking countries and their effects on the stakeholders as yet. It is expected that more articles on this area will be published over time and hence allowing a more comprehensive review in the future. Implications for Practice The included articles show provision of wellbeing support, good planning of online content delivery based on sound pedagogical approaches, implementation of computer-based simulation tools suitable for home-based learning environment and use of authentic online assessments would address the impacts on the students and academics.","Ng, Curtise K.C.",Radiography (Lond),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078817421001061; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078817421001061?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34393067/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2021.07.026,427

643630,Count‐Valued Time Series Models for COVID‐19 Daily Death Dynamics,2021-02-22,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Higher incidence and worse outcome of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are observed in dialysis patients, mainly due to weak immune response. However, little is known about seroconversion ability and duration of antibody response after COVID-19 in this group. The aim of this study was to estimate the seroconversion rate and the persistence of IgG response to SARS-CoV2 in dialysis patients. METHOD: Four (4) dialysis patients previously infected with SARS-CoV2 were included in this study. Initially, all patients were tested for the presence of IgG antibodies 21-35 days after the onset of their symptoms. The cut-off value for positivity was a ratio of ≥ 1.4. Those patients with at least two consecutive positive samples were defined as seropositives. Seropositives were then having their antibodies tested monthly for a maximum period of six months or until the first negative result. Duration of antibody persistence was defined as the time between the day IgG were last detected and the day of onset of infection. RESULTS: All four patients were seropositives after the initial test (seroconversion rate = 100%) with a mean IgG ratio of 6.44 (±1.28). Median follow up period was 128 (range 96-193) days. Median duration of antibody persistence was 153 (range 103-193) days. By the sixth month, IgG had turned negative in two of four patients (rate = 50%). CONCLUSION: In our study, dialysis patients showed a remarkable seroconversion rate after infection with SARS-CoV2. However, a rapid decline of IgG antibodies was observed in half of them.","Tsikliras, Nikolaos; Anagnostara, Aggelina; Rekari, Vasiliki; Nikitidis, Ilias; Kyrgialanis, Apostolos",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab098.0067,427

We attempted to deduce a formula in order to model the number of the ICU patients in France from the official data and patient turnover in the ICU. METHODSThe Covid-19 ICU patient turnover was calculated using a recurrence relation from the internal data provided by Hospices Civils de Lyon. The number of new Covid-19 cases detected daily was modelized to fit with the last known data in France and extrapolated for the coming days using two scenarios following the existing data in China (best scenario) and Italy (worst scenario). The number of daily admissions in ICU was calculated as the sum of 13.7% of the new Covid-19 cases detected on a given day and 7.8% of the average of the total new Covid-19 cases recorded in the last week. Approximately 39.7% of patients admitted to the ICU were non-intubated with an average ICU length of stay of 4 days. Conversely, 60.3% of patients were intubated and for those who died among them (14.44%) the ICU length of stay was of 4 days for 78.3% of them and of 15 days for 21.7% of them. For the intubated patients that were discharged alive, the ICU length of stay was of 6 days for 44.4% of them and of 20 days for 55.6% of them.

645054,Globalization and the World Order in the New Realities of the Post-COVID World,2021-09-14,"BACKGROUND: The clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy is often limited by the lack of pre-existing CD8+ T cells infiltrating the tumor. In principle, CD8+ T-cell infiltration could be promoted by therapeutic vaccination. However, this remains challenging given the paucity of vaccine platforms able to induce the strong cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell response required to reject tumors. A therapeutic cancer vaccine that induces a robust cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell response against shared tumor antigens and can be combined with ICB could improve the outcome of cancer immunotherapy. METHODS: Here, we developed a heterologous prime-boost vaccine based on a chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1) and a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) encoding MAGE-type antigens, which are tumor-specific shared antigens expressed in different tumor types. The mouse MAGE-type antigen P1A was used as a surrogate to study the efficacy of the vaccine in combination with ICB in murine tumor models expressing the P1A antigen. To characterize the vaccine-induced immune response, we performed flow cytometry and transcriptomic analyses. RESULTS: The ChAdOx1/MVA vaccine displayed strong immunogenicity with potent induction of CD8+ T cells. When combined with anti-Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1), the vaccine induced superior tumor clearance and survival in murine tumor models expressing P1A compared with anti-PD-1 alone. Remarkably, ChAdOx1/MVA P1A vaccination promoted CD8+ T-cell infiltration in the tumors, and drove inflammation in the tumor microenvironment, turning 'cold' tumors into 'hot' tumors. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the P1A-specific CD8+ T cells revealed an expanded population of stem-like T cells in the spleen after the combination treatment as compared with vaccine alone, and a reduced PD-1 expression in the tumor CD8+ T cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the synergistic potency of ChAdOx1/MVA MAGE vaccines combined with anti-PD-1 for cancer therapy, and establish the foundation for clinical translation of this approach. A clinical trial of ChadOx1/MVA MAGE-A3/NY-ESO-1 combined with anti-PD-1 will commence shortly.","McAuliffe, James; Chan, Hok Fung; Noblecourt, Laurine; Ramirez-Valdez, Ramiro Andrei; Pereira-Almeida, Vinnycius; Zhou, Yaxuan; Pollock, Emily; Cappuccini, Federica; Redchenko, Irina; Hill, Adrian Vs; Leung, Carol Sze Ki; Van den Eynde, Benoit J",J. immunotherap. cancer,https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2021-003218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34479921/,427

In this article, we would like to present a patient who developed Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), which is a serious complication after receiving the inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac). Case report - A 76-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with nine days of progressive limb weakness. Two weeks prior to admission, he received the second dose of CoronaVac vaccine. Motor examination revealed decreased extremity strength with 3/5 in the lower extremities versus 4/5 in the upper extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were absent in all four extremities. Nerve conduction studies showed predominantly reduced amplitude in both motor and sensory nerves, consistent with AMSAN (acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy). Conclusion - Clinicians should be aware of the neuro-logical complications or other side effects associated with COVID-19 vaccination so that early treatment can be an option.","Tutar, Nurhan Kaya; Eyigürbüz, Tugba; Yildirim, Zerrin; Kale, Nilufer",Ideggyogy Sz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370408/; https://doi.org/10.18071/isz.74.0286,427

As it is not feasible to vaccinate at the same time the whole population, the states, provinces and cities had arranged – though, admittedly, taking into consideration limited numbers of criteria - homogenous groups of citizens, who, labelled as “risk groups”, have been chosen as those who will be receiving the vaccination before others, adding to the already existing feelings of chaos and shortage. We want to address the issue that despite the access to the expertise and knowledge of intradisciplinary committees, we still do not have a satisfactory answer regarding the further steps for the vaccination programs. We believe it is due to the persistence of the binary way of reasoning, with its tendency to overlook the complexity of the issue and emphasise objectivity while neglecting the subjective factors that cannot be easily quantified. For that very reason, we propose the application of the theories of uncertainty with the support of the Fuzzy Subset Theory, which will result in the creation of the humanist algorithms of clustering of populations, allotment of different kinds of vaccine for diverse persons in the groups and, finally ranking for the priority of vaccination. This approach will allow designing such a model to maintain, to the highest possible level, the principles of ethics, morale and solidarity, and efficiency and effectiveness.","Gil-Aluja, Jaime; Gil-Lafuente, Jaime; Nowak, Martyna",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444883421000322?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2444883421000322,427

Neck circumference (NC) has been shown to be strongly related to cardiometabolic and respiratory illnesses even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI). We performed a prospective study to investigate the potential of NC to predict the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in adult COVID‐19 inpatients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively and consecutively enrolled COVID‐19 adult patients admitted to dedicated medical wards of two Italian hospitals from 25 March to 7 April 2020. On admission, clinical, biochemical and anthropometric data, including BMI and NC were collected. As primary outcome measure, the maximum respiratory support received was evaluated. Follow‐up time was 30 days from hospital admission. RESULTS: We enrolled 132 subjects (55.0‐75.8 years, 32% female). During the study period, 26 (19.7%) patients underwent IMV. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension and COPD, NC resulted independently and significantly associated with IMV risk (adjusted OR 1.260—per 1 cm increase 95% CI:1.120‐1.417; P < .001), with a stronger association in the subgroup with BMI ≤30 Kg/m(2) (adjusted OR 1.526; 95% CI:1.243‐1.874; P < .001). NC showed a good discrimination power in predicting patients requiring IMV (AUC 0.783; 95% CI:0.684‐0.882; P < .001). In particular, NC > 40.5 cm (>37.5 for females and >42.5 for males) showed a higher and earlier IMV risk compared to subjects with lower NC (Log‐rank test: P < .001).

We perform its statistical analysis and study epidemic geographical patterns. We observe exponentially distributed test positivity and exponential trends in its geographical distribution, and its approximately 10 km spatial characteristic correlation length. A small correlation between positivity in two consecutive testing rounds appeared on the municipalities level but it significantly increased on the counties level. Recent 7-day PCR tests incidence per capita served as a good proxy for antigen test positivity. Positivity of non-residents was higher than of residents when mass testing was offered only in municipalities with the highest positivity in previous rounds. Reduction in positivity in repeated testing increased with the positivity in the earlier round.

The viral solutions were exposed on glass samples uniformly loaded with copper and silver compounds. Exposure to solid-state cuprous oxide (Cu(2)O) efficiently inactivated both influenza A virus and bacteriophage Qβ, whereas solid-state cupric oxide (CuO) and silver sulfide (Ag(2)S) showed little antiviral activity. Copper ions from copper chloride (CuCl(2)) had little effect on the activity of bacteriophage Qβ in spite of the fact that copper ions strongly inactivate influenza A in previous studies. Silver ions from silver nitrate (AgNO(3)) and silver(I) oxide (Ag(2)O) in solution showed strong inactivation of influenza A and weak inactivation of bacteriophage Qβ. We also investigated the influence of the compounds on the function of two influenza viral proteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Silver ions from AgNO(3) and Ag(2)O remarkably decreased enzymatic activity of neuraminidase through the breakage of disulfide (S—S) bonds, corresponding to the selective inactivation of influenza A virus. By contrast, exposure to Cu(2)O markedly reduced the activity of hemagglutinin rather than neuraminidase. These findings suggest that solid-state Cu(2)O disrupts host cell recognition by denaturing protein structures on viral surfaces, leading to the inactivation of viruses regardless of the presence of a viral envelope.","Minoshima, Masafumi; Lu, Yue; Kimura, Takuto; Nakano, Ryuichi; Ishiguro, Hitoshi; Kubota, Yoshinobu; Hashimoto, Kazuhito; Sunada, Kayano",J Hazard Mater,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27015373/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389416302382; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389416302382; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.03.023,427

Quantitative measurements of lipoprotein subfractions, α-1-acid glycoprotein, glucose, and biogenic amines were made on samples from symptomatic coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients who had tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (n = 17) and from age- and gender-matched controls (n = 25). Data were analyzed using an orthogonal-projections to latent structures (OPLS) method and used to construct an exceptionally strong (AUROC = 1) hybrid NMR-MS model that enabled detailed metabolic discrimination between the groups and their biochemical relationships. Key discriminant metabolites included markers of inflammation including elevated α-1-acid glycoprotein and an increased kynurenine/tryptophan ratio. There was also an abnormal lipoprotein, glucose, and amino acid signature consistent with diabetes and coronary artery disease (low total and HDL Apolipoprotein A1, low HDL triglycerides, high LDL and VLDL triglycerides), plus multiple highly significant amino acid markers of liver dysfunction (including the elevated glutamine/glutamate and Fischer’s ratios) that present themselves as part of a distinct SARS-CoV-2 infection pattern. A multivariate training-test set model was validated using independent samples from additional SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and controls. The predictive model showed a sensitivity of 100% for SARS-CoV-2 positivity. The breadth of the disturbed pathways indicates a systemic signature of SARS-CoV-2 positivity that includes elements of liver dysfunction, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and coronary heart disease risk that are consistent with recent reports that COVID-19 is a systemic disease affecting multiple organs and systems.

In the present study, we analyzed the key role of mindfulness dispositions in protecting the individual against psychological distress consequent to COVID-19 social distancing and quarantining. METHODS: An online survey was launched on March 13, 2020, with 6,412 responses by April 6, 2020. Socio-demographic information, exposure to the pandemic, and quarantining were assessed together with psychological distress and mindfulness disposition. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to study the influence of predictive factors on psychological distress and quality of life in Italian responders during the early days of lockdown. Pearson correlations were calculated to study the relationship between mindfulness and psychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: Multivariate linear regression run on socio-demographics, COVID-19-related variables, and mindfulness disposition as moderators of overall psychological distress showed that mindfulness was the best predictor of psychological distress (β = −0.504; p < 0.0001). High negative correlations were found between mindfulness disposition and the overall Global Severity Index (r = −0.637; p < 0.0001), while moderate to high associations were found between mindfulness and all SCL-90 sub-scales.

We collected data at admission, 3(rd), 8(th) and 14(th) day of hospitalization. We calculated the hazard ratio (HR) and compared 28-day in-hospital mortality risk factors between admission and follow-up models using a time-dependent Cox regression model. RESULTS: Of 524 patients, 50.4% needed mechanical ventilation. The 28-day mortality rate was 32.8%.

Specific treatment options for diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 are largely lacking. Herein, we used a pseudotype virus (pv) bearing the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein to screen a botanical drug library to identify an agent against SARS-CoV-2 entry. All the four hits, including angeloylgomisin O, schisandrin B, procyanidin, and oleanonic acid, were identified for effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S pv entry in the micromolar range. A mechanistic study revealed that these four agents inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S pv entry by blocking S-mediated membrane fusion. Furthermore, angeloylgomisin O, schisandrin B, and oleanonic acid inhibited authentic SARS-CoV-2 with a high selective index (SI). We also showed that all the four hits could also inhibit the entry of pv of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants (D614G, K417N/E484K/N501Y/D614G). In drug combination studies performed in cellular antiviral assays, angeloylgomisin O and schisandrin B displayed synergistic effects in combination with remdesivir.

661929,Exercise Addiction and Muscle Dysmorphia: The Role of Emotional Dependence and Attachment,2021-06-18,"BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic. To overcome the lack of human resources during this crisis, some ICUs had to mobilize staff from a reinforcement pool, with no or outdated ICU experience. This study aimed to investigate and to compare the psychological impact of the pandemic on ICU regular staff and reinforcement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Self-assessment questionnaire were completed by HCWs who worked from March the 1st to April the 30th 2020 in our 16 bed Neurological-ICU at La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, France, which was converted to a COVID-ICU. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5, McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire-Revised, and 10-item Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale were used to assess respectively anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), quality of life (QoL) and resilience. RESULTS: Sixty-nine ICU-HCWs completed the survey (37 from the regular staff, i.e from the public health service, and 32 from a reinforcement pool, either from non-ICU public health service, or from private health care interim employment agencies). Prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms were high, at 19%, 9% and 16% respectively, with limited impairment in QoL or resilience scores. Depression symptoms were more observed in the regular staff compared to welcomed reinforcement, respectively at 16% and 0%. CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that during the pandemic, HCWs from the regular staff were at greater risk of developing psychological disorder compared to reinforcement, with higher levels of depressive symptoms.","Altmayer, Victor; Weiss, Nicolas; Cao, Albert; Marois, Clémence; Demeret, Sophie; Rohaut, Benjamin; Le Guennec, Loïc",Aust Crit Care,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aucc.2020.11.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1036731420303465?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1036731420303465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33358273/,427

662531,Simulation of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions on COVID-19 with an Agent-based Model of Zonal Restraint,2020-06-16,"Airborne particles are a major route for transmission of COVID-19 and many other infectious diseases. When a person talks, sings, coughs, or sneezes, nasal and throat secretions are spewed into the air. After a short initial fragmentation stage, the expelled material is mostly composed of spherical particles of different sizes. While the dynamics of the largest droplets are dominated by gravitational effects, the smaller aerosol particles, mostly transported by means of hydrodynamic drag, form clouds that can remain afloat for long times. In subsaturated air environments, the dependence of pathogen-laden particle dispersion on their size is complicated due to evaporation of the aqueous fraction. Particle dynamics can significantly change when ambient conditions favor rapid evaporation rates that result in a transition from buoyancy-to-drag dominated dispersion regimes. To investigate the effect of particle size and evaporation on pathogen-laden cloud evolution, a direct numerical simulation of a mild cough was coupled with an evaporative Lagrangian particle advection model. The results suggest that while the dispersion of cough particles in the tails of the size distribution are unlikely to be disrupted by evaporative effects, preferential aerosol diameters (30–40 μm) may exhibit significant increases in the residence time and horizontal range under typical ambient conditions. Using estimations of the viral concentration in the spewed fluid and the number of ejected particles in a typical respiratory event, we obtained a map of viral load per volume of air at the end of the cough and the number of virus copies per inhalation in the emitter vicinity.","Fabregat, Alexandre; Gisbert, Ferran; Vernet, Anton; Ferré, Josep Anton; Mittal, Ketan; Dutta, Som; Pallarès, Jordi",Phys Fluids (1994),https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0045416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897242/,427

KANOPEE_2 is a smartphone-based application that provides interactions with a virtual agent to autonomously screen and alleviate insomnia symptoms through an intervention programme giving personalized advices regarding sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques and stimulus-control. In this proof-of-concept study, we tested the effects of KANOPEE_2 among users from all over the country (France) who downloaded the app between 1 June and 26 October 2020 (to focus on effects after the end of COVID-19 confinement). Outcome measures include insomnia severity (Insomnia Severity Index) and sleep/wake schedules measured by a sleep diary. One-thousand and thirty-four users answered the screening interview (Mage = 43.76 years; SD = 13.14), and 108 completed the two-step programme (Mage = 46.64 years; SD = 13.63). Of those who answered the screening, 42.8% did not report sleep complaints, while 57.2% presented mild-to-severe insomnia symptoms. At the end of the intervention, users reported significantly fewer sleep complaints compared with the beginning of the intervention (Insomnia Severity Indexbeginning = 13.58; Insomnia Severity Indexend = 11.30; p < 0.001), and significantly increased their sleep efficiency (sleep efficiencybeginning = 76.46%; sleep efficiencyend = 80.17%; p = 0.013). KANOPEE_2 is a promising solution both to provide autonomous evaluation of individuals' sleep hygiene and reduce insomnia symptoms over a brief and simple intervention.

In this commentary, we identify challenges and opportunities at human–primate interfaces in light of COVID‐19, focusing on examples from Asia, and make recommendations for researchers working with wild primates to reduce zoonosis risk and leverage research opportunities. First, we briefly review the evidence for zoonotic origins of SARS‐CoV‐2 and discuss risks of zoonosis at the human–primate interface. We then identify challenges that the pandemic has caused for primates, including reduced nutrition, increased intraspecific competition, and increased poaching risk, as well as challenges facing primatologists, including lost research opportunities. Subsequently, we highlight opportunities arising from pandemic‐related lockdowns and public health messaging, including opportunities to reduce the intensity of problematic human–primate interfaces, opportunities to reduce the risk of zoonosis between humans and primates, opportunities to reduce legal and illegal trade in primates, new opportunities for research on human–primate interfaces, and opportunities for community education. Finally, we recommend specific actions that primatologists should take to reduce contact and aggression between humans and primates, to reduce demand for primates as pets, to reduce risks of zoonosis in the context of field research, and to improve understanding of human–primate interfaces. Reducing the risk of zoonosis and promoting the well‐being of humans and primates at our interfaces will require substantial changes from “business as usual.” We encourage primatologists to help lead the way.","Lappan, Susan; Malaivijitnond, Suchinda; Radhakrishna, Sindhu; Riley, Erin P.; Ruppert, Nadine",Am J Primatol,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajp.23176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32686188/,427

These changes named collectively as “immunosenescence” include decreases in both the innate and adaptive immune responses in addition to the exacerbated production of inflammatory cytokines. This scenario of immunological dysfunction and its relationship with disease development in older people has been widely studied, especially in infections that can be fatal, such as influenza and, more recently, COVID-19. In the current scenario of SARS-CoV-2 infection, many mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in old individuals have been proposed. To better understand the dynamics of COVID-19 in this group, aspects related to immunological senescence must be well elucidated. In this article, we discuss the main mechanisms involved in immunosenescence and their possible correlations with the susceptibility of individuals of advanced age to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the more severe conditions of the disease.","Pietrobon, Anna Julia; Teixeira, Franciane Mouradian Emidio; Sato, Maria Notomi",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33193377/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.579220,427

We assessed the psychological impact of COVID-19 on adults and children, with special attention to health care workers (HCWs). Methods: A self-rated online survey, including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) for adults and the Children Revised Impact of Event Scale-Revised-13 items (CRIES-13) for their 8–18-year-old offspring, was conducted in Italy on March 20–26, 2020. Linear mixed-effects models were applied to the data, accounting for age, sex, education, and other demographic characteristics. Results: Data were available from 2,419 adults (78.4% females, mean age 38.1 ± SD 13.1 years; 15.7% HCW) and 786 children (50.1% male, mean age 12.3 ± 3.2 years). Median (IQR) IES-R score was 30.0 (21.0–40.0), corresponding to mild psychological impact, with 33.2% reporting severe psychological impact. IES-R was lower in HCWs (29.0) than non-HCWs (31.0), but HCWs directly involved in COVID-19 care had higher scores [33.0 (26.0–43.2)] than uninvolved HCWs [28.0 (19.0–36.0)]. Median CRIES-13 score was [21.0 (11.0–32.0)], with 30.9% of the children at high risk for post-traumatic stress disorder. Parent and child scores were correlated.

666663,"Youth in Northern Ireland: Linking Violence Exposure, Emotional Insecurity, and the Political Macrosystem",2020-11-12,"BACKGROUND: At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, several mental health care providers were obliged to shut down outpatient services, including group therapy and psychoeducational sessions. The lockdown in many countries is a serious threat to people’s mental well-being, especially for individuals with severe mental illnesses. Discontinued outpatient treatments and disruption of daily routines are considered to be risk factors for destabilization of patients with mental illness. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptability, usability, and feasibility of a group chat program to replace cancelled face-to-face group sessions in an outpatient psychiatric department. METHODS: Participants (N=33) were recruited in the outpatient department of a large university medical center in Leipzig, Germany. Former face-to-face group participants were invited to take part in a therapist-guided group-chat for 4 weeks (8 sessions) and were asked to evaluate the program via self-administered standardized questionnaires at baseline (T0, preintervention), after every chat session (T1), and posttreatment (T2, after 4-6 weeks). The chat groups were specific to the following mental disorder diagnoses and based on the same therapeutic principles and techniques as the former face-to-face groups: anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Sociodemographic measures, attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic, depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), quality of life (abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment), treatment credibility/expectancy (Credibility Expectancy Questionnaire), and participants’ satisfaction (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 [ZUF-8]) were measured. RESULTS: Participants joined an average of 5 out of 8 offered chat sessions. Participation rates in the respective groups were highest in the ADHD group (8.6/11, 78%) and lowest in the anxiety group (3.7/9, 41%). The overall preintervention level of depressive symptoms was moderate and showed a slight, nonsignificant improvement at posttreatment (T0: mean 10.7, SD 5.5; T2: mean 10.2, SD 5.5). A similar result was observed regarding quality of life (T0: median 41.7-68.8; T2: median 50-70.3). Treatment credibility and expectancy scores were medium-high (T0: mean(credibility) 18.1, SD 3.8; mean(expectancy) 11.2, SD 5.1; T2: mean(credibility) 17.1, SD 4.8; mean(expectancy) 10.3, SD 5.8). Further, significant correlations were detected between posttreatment expectancy score and posttreatment PHQ-9 score (r=–0.41, P=.02), posttreatment physical quality of life (r=0.54, P=.001), and posttreatment psychological quality of life (r=0.53, P=.002). Overall, participants’ satisfaction with the program was very high, both after chat sessions and at posttreatment (ZUF-8: mean score 20.6, SD 1.0). Of all participants, a majority (27/31, 87%) rated the program as excellent/good and indicated they would recommend the group chat program to a friend in need of similar help (23/31, 74%). CONCLUSIONS: A therapist-guided group chat program to substitute outpatient group setting treatment during the COVID-19 lockdown was shown to be feasible, usable, and highly acceptable for participants. Web-based programs such as this one provide an easy-to-implement tool to successfully stabilize participants during a difficult time, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

How do different categories of social media users’ posts affect risk perception and vice versa? We use Granger causality analysis and impulse response functions to answer the research questions. The results show that from one perspective, the government and the media on Sina Weibo play critical roles in forming and affecting risk perceptions. From another perspective, risk perception promotes the posting of the media and the public on Sina Weibo.

COVID-19 is spreading rapidly with a high mortality rate due to unavailability of effective treatment or vaccine for the disease. The high rate of mutation and recombination in SARS-CoV2 makes it difficult for scientist to develop specific anti-CoV2 drugs and vaccines. SARS-CoV-2-Mpro cleaves the viral polyprotein to produce a variety of non-structural proteins, but in human host it also cleaves the nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) essential modulator (NEMO), which suppresses the activation of the NF-κB pathway and weakens the immune response. Since the main protease (Mpro) is required for viral gene expression and replication, it is a promising target for antagonists to treat novel coronavirus disease and discovery of high resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2-Mpro provide an opportunity for in silico identification of its possible inhibitors. In this study we intend to find novel and potential Mpro inhibitors from around 1830 chemically diverse and therapeutically important secondary metabolites available in the MeFSAT database by performing molecular docking against the Mpro structure of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6LZE). After ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profile and binding energy calculation through MM-GBSA for top five hits, Sterenin M was proposed as a SARS-CoV2-Mpro inhibitor with validation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study. Sterenin M seems to have the potential to be a promising ligand against SARS-CoV-2, and thus it requires further validation by in vitro and in vivo studies.","Prajapati, Jignesh; Patel, Rohit; Goswami, Dweipayan; Saraf, Meenu; Rawal, Rakesh M.",Comput Biol Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482521003620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34174757/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521003620?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104568,427

Rats were immunized either subcutaneously or intranasally with Ad-S(N) once a week for three consecutive weeks. Our results showed that all of the immunized animals generated humoral immunity against the SARS-CoV spike protein, and the sera of immunized rats showed strong capable of protecting from SARS-CoV infection in vitro. Histopathological examination did not find evident side effects in the immunized animals.

This promoted us to study the spread of COVID-19 in athletes and formulate prevention strategies. Methodology: We collected and analyzed the demographic information, such as nationality, sex, age, name, sport played, sport level, source and cause of infection, date of symptoms onset or confirmation of positive status, date of recovery, location of infection contraction, symptoms, and the people infected by the contracted athletes, of 521 infected athletes worldwide, as of the end of July, 2020. Results: The cohort comprised 95.49% male athletes; 57.2% were aged 19–35 years, with the average age 23 years. Most of these cases emerged in March 2020 (27.3%) and June 2020 (30.1%), 90.8% of cases were active athletes and 74.2% were professional players, 45.2% of infected athletes exhibited mild symptoms and 30.6% of them were asymptomatic; however, 23.1% of the cases died, including cases aged less than 40 years. Most infected athletes represented soccer (46.6%), football (15.9%), and basketball (10.9%). Most of the infected athletes were from the United States, Western Europe, and Eastern Asia.

There has also been an upsurge in utilizing digital solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic to address the unmet mental healthcare needs, especially for those unable to afford in-person office-based therapy sessions or those living in remote rural areas with limited access to mental healthcare providers. Despite these benefits, there are significant concerns regarding the widespread use of such technologies in the healthcare system. A few of those concerns are a potential breach in the patients' privacy, confidentiality, and the agency of patients being at risk of getting used for marketing or data harnessing purposes. Digital phenotyping aims to detect and categorize an individual's behavior, activities, interests, and psychological features to properly customize future communications or mental care for that individual. Neuromarketing seeks to investigate an individual's neuronal response(s) (cortical and subcortical autonomic) characteristics and uses this data to direct the person into purchasing merchandise of interest, or shaping individual's opinion in consumer, social or political decision making, etc. This commentary's primary concern is the intersection of these two concepts that would be an inevitable threat, more so, in the post-COVID era when disparities would be exaggerated globally. We also addressed the potential “dark web” applications in this intersection, worsening the crisis.

With increase in number of cases and mortality from Covid, the primary focus is shifted to the management of the Covid crisis and other health emergencies thus affecting normal health services and routine treatment of other diseases like cancer. METHODS: This article reviews the published literature and guidelines on Covid and cancer and discusses them to optimize the care of cancer patients during Covid pandemic to improve treatment outcomes. RESULTS: The results of the review of published literature show a twofold increase in probability of getting CoV2 infection by the cancer patients and a four-fold increase in chance of death. On the other hand, if left untreated a 20% increase in cancer death is expected. Data further show that none of the medicines like remdesivir, hydroxy chloroquin, dexamethasone, or azithromycin improves survival and response to Covid in cancer patients. Surgical results too show similar outcome before and after the pandemic though most of these report on highly selected patients populations. CONCLUSIONS: The Covid 2019 pandemic places cancer patients in a very difficult situation wherein if they seek treatment, they are exposing themselves to a risk of developing CoV2 infection and if they do not, the probability of dying without treatment increases. Hence, for them it is a choice between the devil and deep sea, and it is for the healthcare providers to triage patients and treat who cannot wait even though the data from the carefully selected cohort of patients show no increase in mortality or morbidity from treatment during Covid.","Chakraborty, Mainak; Pandey, Manoj",World J Surg Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32828120/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12957-020-02002-7,427

Reflections on Life During a Pandemic.,2021-08-01,"OBJECTIVE Previous literature finds an increase in depressive symptoms, substance use, and suicidal ideation following the COVID-19 pandemic in the US - suicides do not appear to increase. We examine whether 1) state lockdown policies in the US precede an increase in mental health symptoms; and 2) the extent to which using substances amplifies or attenuates the relation. METHODS We specified, as our exposure variable, the timing of state-level lockdown orders. We used, as the outcome variable, the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) that measures anxiety and depression symptoms. We utilized the Understanding America Study (UAS), a nationally representative sample of 7,597 adults across 50 states in the US, surveyed biweekly between March 10, 2020 and November 11, 2020. Linear fixed effect analyses controlled for time-invariant individual factors, as well as employment status, household income, and previous mental health diagnosis. RESULTS Regression results indicate an increase in PHQ-4 scores of approximately 1.70 during lockdown, relative to no lockdown (p < 0.05). Relative to no lockdown, an increase in alcohol use corresponds with a 0.08 unit decrease in PHQ-4 scores during lockdown (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION State lockdown policies precede greater mental health symptoms. Increases in consuming alcohol attenuates the relation between state lockdown policies and mental health symptoms. Results may portend greater addiction following the pandemic warranting further investigation into utilization of substance use treatment.","Das, Abhery; Singh, Parvati; Bruckner, Tim A.",Addict Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34507184/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306460321002690; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.107084; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460321002690?v=s5,427

Up-to-date treatment regimens consist of prophylactic and supportive treatment of the recurrent infections. Here, we report the case of a 1-year-old boy of Moroccan consanguineous parents, who was diagnosed at 4 months of age with ICF syndrome with a homozygous missense mutation in the DNMT3B gene. He was initially admitted to the hospital with recurrent pulmonary infections from the opportunistic pathogen Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJ). Further immunological workup revealed agammaglobulinemia in the presence of B cells. After successful recovery from the PJ pneumonia, he underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from the HLA-matched healthy sister using a chemotherapeutic conditioning regimen consisting of treosulfan, fludarabine, and thiotepa. Other than acute chemotherapy-associated side effects, no serious adverse events occurred. Six months after HSCT immune-reconstitution, he had a stable chimerism with 2.9% autologous portion in the peripheral blood and a normal differential blood cell count, including all immunoglobulin subtypes. This is one of the first cases of successful HSCT in ICF syndrome. Early diagnosis and subsequent HSCT can prevent severe opportunistic infections and cure the immunodeficiency. Centromeric instability and facial anomaly remain unaffected. Although the long-term patient outcome and the neurological development remain to be seen, this curative therapy for immunodeficiency improves life expectancy and quality of life. This case is meant to raise physicians awareness for ICF syndrome and highlight the consideration for HSCT in ICF syndrome early on.","Gössling, Katharina L.; Schipp, Cyrill; Fischer, Ute; Babor, Florian; Koch, Gerhard; Schuster, Friedhelm R.; Dietzel-Dahmen, Jutta; Wieczorek, Dagmar; Borkhardt, Arndt; Meisel, Roland; Kuhlen, Michaela",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28713390/,427

The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive evolutionary analysis to describe the human outbreak and the evolutionary rate of different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular evolution in nine genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed using three different approaches: phylogenetic signal assessment, emergence of amino acid substitutions, and Bayesian evolutionary rate estimation in eight successive fortnights since the virus emergence. All observed phylogenetic signals were very low and trees topologies were in agreement with those signals. However, after four months of evolution, it was possible to identify regions revealing an incipient viral lineages formation despite the low phylogenetic signal, since fortnight 3. Finally, the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate for regions nsp3 and S, the ones presenting greater variability, was estimated to values of 1.37 × 10−3 and 2.19 × 10−3 substitution/site/year, respectively. In conclusion, results obtained in this work about the variable diversity of crucial viral regions and the determination of the evolutionary rate are consequently decisive to understand essential feature of viral emergence. In turn, findings may allow characterizing for the first time, the evolutionary rate of S protein that is crucial for vaccines development.","Pereson, Matías J.; Mojsiejczuk, Laura; Martínez, Alfredo P.; Flichman, Diego M.; Garcia, Gabriel H.; Di Lello, Federico A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.21.212860,427

Smallpox has been eradicated for 40 years, and complications that remain after smallpox has been cured have become a remarkable diagnostic challenge for contemporary physicians. In this systematic review, we searched PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science, and Google Scholar for cases on complications, diagnosis, and treatment for osteomyelitis variolosa between January 1980 and February 2021. RESULTS: Ten papers and eleven finished cases, all patients from India, were included for comparison with the present case. In total, 100% of patients presented with bilateral elbow deformities, the ankle was the second most common site of lesion in 50%, and knee lesions accounted for 25% in this study. Flexion contracture, joint instability, secondary arthritis, and fracture are common complications of osteomyelitis variolosa, and most patients receive conservative treatment, while internal fixation has good results for combined fractures. CONCLUSIONS: Although osteomyelitis variolosa is not a direct threat to the safety of patients, severe skeletal deformities can have a significant impact on quality of life. With advances in surgical techniques, clinicians are offering an increasing number of treatment options for patients with osteomyelitis variolosa. However, most importantly, smallpox has basically been removed from the historical arena, and for areas where smallpox was once endemic, physicians need to deepen the understanding of this disease again.","Tang, Jinshuo; Shao, Pu; Liu, Te; Wen, Xinggui; Wang, Yeliang; Wang, Chenyu; Peng, Yachen; Yao, Hua; Zuo, Jianlin",Orphanet J Rare Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-021-01985-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34362412/,427

Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) published strict criteria to classify the timing of mother-to-child transmission into different categories. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of vertical transmission in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive women. METHODS: We included 42 pregnant women fulfilling the inclusion criteria which presented a positive nasopharyngeal test at 24-48 hours before delivery and had obstetric indication of cesarean section at a Perinatology center in Mexico City. All women were asymptomatic at the time of the test. The newborns had both oral and rectal swabs collected at birth and at 24 hours after birth. Viral detection was carried out by RT-PCR in all samples. Relevant medical information was retrieved from clinical records. RESULTS: Initially all women were asymptomatic for COVID-19 and 25 (59%) developed mild disease after discharge. Three (7%) neonatal deaths occurred, none of them had a positive SARS-coV-2 test nor COVID-19-related symptoms. There were five cases of intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2, according to the WHO criteria. Our results also showed that performing only one neonatal swab (oral or rectal) may reduce SARS-CoV-2 detection by 40%. CONCLUSION: This study contributes with evidence to reinforce the existence of vertical transmission even in asymptomatic patients and highlights the importance of testing more than one sample in newborns to increase the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2.

675142,ASEAN and the EU amidst COVID-19: overcoming the self-fulfilling prophecy of realism,2021-03-13,"Most randomized trials are designed and analyzed using frequentist statistical approaches such as null hypothesis testing and P values. Conceptually, P values are cumbersome to understand, as they provide evidence of data incompatibility with a null hypothesis (e.g., no clinical benefit) and not direct evidence of the alternative hypothesis (e.g., clinical benefit). This counterintuitive framework may contribute to the misinterpretation that the absence of evidence is equal to evidence of absence and may cause the discounting of potentially informative data. Bayesian methods provide an alternative, probabilistic interpretation of data. The reanalysis of completed trials using Bayesian methods is becoming increasingly common, particularly for trials with effect estimates that appear clinically significant despite P values above the traditional threshold of 0.05. Statistical inference using Bayesian methods produces a distribution of effect sizes that would be compatible with observed trial data, interpreted in the context of prior assumptions about an intervention (called “priors”). These priors are chosen by investigators to reflect existing beliefs and past empirical evidence regarding the effect of an intervention. By calculating the likelihood of clinical benefit, a Bayesian reanalysis can augment the interpretation of a trial. However, if priors are not defined a priori, there is a legitimate concern that priors could be constructed in a manner that produces biased results. Therefore, some standardization of priors for Bayesian reanalysis of clinical trials may be desirable for the critical care community. In this Critical Care Perspective, we discuss both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to clinical trial analysis, introduce a framework that researchers can use to select priors for a Bayesian reanalysis, and demonstrate how to apply our proposal by conducting a novel Bayesian trial reanalysis.","Zampieri, Fernando G.; Casey, Jonathan D.; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Harrell, Frank E.; Harhay, Michael O.",Am J Respir Crit Care Med,https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202006-2381cp; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33270526/,427

675626,Complicated Grief: What to Expect After the Coronavirus Pandemic,2020-05-26,"BACKGROUND: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most prevalent congenital viral infection in the United States and Europe causing significant morbidity and mortality to both mother and child. HCMV is also an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised individuals, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)- infected patients with AIDS, and solid organ and allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients. Current treatments for HCMV-associated diseases are insufficient due to the emergence of drug-induced resistance and cytotoxicity, necessitating novel approaches to limit HCMV infection. The aim of this study was to develop therapeutic peptides targeting glycoprotein B (gB), a major glycoprotein of HCMV that is highly conserved across the Herpesviridae family, that specifically inhibit fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane preventing HCMV entry and infection. RESULTS: Using the Wimley-White Interfacial Hydrophobicity Scale (WWIHS), several regions within gB were identified that display a high potential to interact with lipid bilayers of cell membranes and hydrophobic surfaces within proteins. The ability of synthetic peptides analogous to WWIHS-positive sequences of HCMV gB to inhibit viral infectivity was evaluated. Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were infected with the Towne-GFP strain of HCMV (0.5 MOI), preincubated with peptides at a range of concentrations (78 nm to 100 μM), and GFP-positive cells were visualized 48 hours post-infection by fluorescence microscopy and analyzed quantitatively by flow cytometry. Peptides that inhibited HCMV infection demonstrated different inhibitory concentration curves indicating that each peptide possesses distinct biophysical properties. Peptide 174-200 showed 80% inhibition of viral infection at a concentration of 100 μM, and 51% and 62% inhibition at concentrations of 5 μM and 2.5 μM, respectively. Peptide 233-263 inhibited infection by 97% and 92% at concentrations of 100 μM and 50 μM, respectively, and 60% at a concentration of 2.5 μM. While peptides 264-291 and 297-315, individually failed to inhibit viral infection, when combined, they showed 67% inhibition of HCMV infection at a concentration of 0.125 μM each. CONCLUSIONS: Peptides designed to target putative fusogenic domains of gB provide a basis for the development of novel therapeutics that prevent HCMV infection.","Melnik, Lilia I; Garry, Robert F; Morris, Cindy A",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21342525/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-76,427

However it is unclear how specific factors are differentially associated with COVID-19 mortality as compared to mortality from other causes. Methods: Working on behalf of NHS England, we carried out a cohort study within the OpenSAFELY platform. Primary care data from England were linked to national death registrations. We included all adults (aged [≥]18 years) in the database on 1st February 2020 and with >1 year of continuous prior registration, the cut-off date for deaths was 9th November 2020. Associations between individual-level characteristics and COVID-19 and non-COVID deaths were estimated by fitting age- and sex-adjusted logistic models for these two outcomes. Results: 17,456,515 individuals were included. 17,063 died from COVID-19 and 134,316 from other causes. Most factors associated with COVID-19 death were similarly associated with non-COVID death, but the magnitudes of association differed. Older age was more strongly associated with COVID-19 death than non-COVID death (e.g. ORs 40.7 [95% CI 37.7-43.8] and 29.6 [28.9-30.3] respectively for [≥]80 vs 50-59 years), as was male sex, deprivation, obesity, and some comorbidities. Smoking, history of cancer and chronic liver disease had stronger associations with non-COVID than COVID-19 death. All non-white ethnic groups had higher odds than white of COVID-19 death (OR for Black: 2.20 [1.96-2.47], South Asian: 2.33 [2.16-2.52]), but lower odds than white of non-COVID death (Black: 0.88 [0.83-0.94], South Asian: 0.78 [0.75-0.81]). Interpretation: Similar associations of most individual-level factors with COVID-19 and non-COVID death suggest that COVID-19 largely multiplies existing risks faced by patients, with some notable exceptions. Identifying the unique factors contributing to the excess COVID-19 mortality risk among non-white groups is a priority to inform efforts to reduce deaths from COVID-19.","Bhaskaran, K.; Bacon, S.

Existing assays that directly measure this activity are limited mainly to measurements of up to two specificities in a single reaction. Here, we develop a multiplex cytotoxicity assay that allows direct, simultaneous measurement of up to 23 different specificities of CD8(+) T cells in a single reaction. This can greatly reduce the amount of starting clinical materials for a systematic screening of CD8(+) T cell epitopes. In addition, this greatly enhanced capacity enables the incorporation of irrelevant epitopes for determining the non-specific killing activity of CD8(+) T cells, thereby allowing to measure the actual epitope-specific cytotoxicity activities. This technique is shown to be useful to study both human and mouse CD8(+) T cells. Besides, our results from human PBMCs and three independent infectious animal models (MERS, influenza and malaria) further reveal that IFNγ expression by epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells does not always correlate with their cell-killing potential, highlighting the need for using cytotoxicity assays in specific contexts (e.g., evaluating vaccine candidates).

This is done by selecting a sample of college students in urban China, a country that has seen air quality as one of the major challenges in the last decades. While young urban college students might be expected to be receptive to standard attempts to be influenced through reason-based cognitive stimuli, it is often found that this is not the case.

Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was first used to examine the relationships among the conceptual constructs derived from the TPB conceptual model, and second Step-Wise Ordinary Least Squares Regressions (SWOLS) were employed to observe the partial effect played by each item on the decision to wear a mask. RESULTS: Results show that, while reason-based stimuli play a role, attitude, social norm, and self-efficacy were the most important predictors of the behavioural intention (p < 0.01). The role of past behaviour was also acknowledged as strongly associated with the dependent variable (p < 0.01). Overall, the likelihood of wearing a pollution mask increases with the importance of others socio-cognitive and psychological factors, which could help understand behavioural biases, and explain the relative role of several mechanisms behind the decision to wear a mask. CONCLUSIONS: While tackling pollution requires multiple and synergic approaches, encouraging self-prevention using pollution mask is a simple and effective action, implementable at negligible costs. Resistance among younger, well-educated cohorts to wear masks can be overcome by stressing the social desirability of action and the sense of empowerment derived from its usage. This study has the potential to inform policies aimed at changing suboptimal behavioural attitudes by identifying triggers for change, and it could serve in improving the tailoring of health promotion messages aimed at nudging healthy behaviour.

The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (n = 1020) expressing a willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was conducted between February and March 2021 and aimed to assess (i) the general trust in different types of vaccines, (ii) the level of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines already in use in Poland (BNT162b2 by BioNTech/Pfizer, mRNA-1273 by Moderna and AZD1222 by Oxford/AstraZeneca) as well as eight vaccines approved outside European Union (EU) or in advanced stages of clinical trials, (iii) level of fear of vaccination against COVID-19, and (iv) main sources of information on COVID-19 vaccination. Among all major vaccine technology, the highest level of trust was observed for the mRNA platform, with a considerable number of surveyed (>20%) not aware of the existence of vaccines produced using the traditional approach (inactivated and live attenuated vaccines). The age of participants was the main factor differentiating the level of trust in a particular vaccine type. Both BNT162b and mRNA-1273 received a high level of acceptance, contrary to AZD1222. From eight vaccines unauthorized in the EU at the moment of study, the CVnCoV (mRNA; CureVac) was met with the highest level of trust, followed by Ad26.COV2.S (vector; Janssen/Johnson&Johnson) and NVX-CoV2373 (protein; Novavax). Sputnik V (vector; Gamaleya Research Institute) was decidedly the least trusted vaccine. The median level of fear (measured by the 10-point Likert-type scale) in the studied group was 4.0, mostly related to the risk of serious allergic reactions, other severe adverse events and unknown long-term effects of vaccination. Female, individuals with a lower level of education and those not seeking any information on the COVID-19 vaccines revealed a higher fear of vaccination. Experts’ materials were the major source of information on COVID-19 vaccines in the studied group. The study shows the level of trust in COVID-19 vaccines can vary much across the producers while the mRNA vaccines are received with a high level of acceptance. It also emphasizes the need for effective and continuous science communication when fighting the pandemic as it may be an ideal time to increase the general awareness of vaccines.","Rzymski, Piotr; Zeyland, Joanna; Poniedziałek, Barbara; Małecka, Ilona; Wysocki, Jacek",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33919672/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9040382,427

678183,The impact of entrepreneurial leadership on SMEs’ performance: the mediating effects of organizational factors,2021-06-16,"Olfactory dysfunction is often the earliest indicator of disease in a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. One tempting working hypothesis is that pathological changes in the peripheral olfactory system where the body is exposed to many adverse environmental stressors may have a causal role for the brain alteration. Whether and how the peripheral pathology spreads to more central brain regions may be effectively studied in rodent models, and there is successful precedence in experimental models for Parkinson's disease. It is of interest to study whether a similar mechanism may underlie the pathology of psychiatric illnesses, such as schizophrenia. However, direct comparison between rodent models and humans includes challenges under light of comparative neuroanatomy and experimental methodologies used in these two distinct species. We believe that neuroimaging modality that has been the main methodology of human brain studies may be a useful viewpoint to address and fill the knowledge gap between rodents and humans in this scientific question. Accordingly, in the present review article, we focus on brain imaging studies associated with olfaction in healthy humans and patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders, and if available those in rodents. We organize this review article at three levels: 1) olfactory bulb (OB) and peripheral structures of the olfactory system, 2) primary olfactory cortical and subcortical regions, and 3) associated higher-order cortical regions. This research area is still underdeveloped, and we acknowledge that further validation with independent cohorts may be needed for many studies presented here, in particular those with human subjects. Nevertheless, whether and how peripheral olfactory disturbance impacts brain function is becoming even a hotter topic in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, given the risk of long-term changes of mental status associated with olfactory infection of SARS-CoV-2. Together, in this review article, we introduce this underdeveloped but important research area focusing on its implications in neurological and psychiatric disorders, with several pioneered publications.","Kulason, Sue; Ratnanather, J Tilak; Miller, Michael I; Kamath, Vidyulata; Hua, Jun; Yang, Kun; Ma, Minghong; Ishizuka, Koko; Sawa, Akira",Semin. cell dev. biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34462249/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2021.08.009,427

Over 42 Million people are infected, and 1.14 Million deaths are reported worldwide as on Oct 23, 2020. A deeper understanding of the epidemic suggests that a person’s negligence can cause widespread harm that would be difficult to negate. Since no vaccine is yet developed, social distancing must be practiced to detain COVID-19 spread. Therefore, we aim to develop a framework that tracks humans for monitoring the social distancing being practiced. To accomplish this objective of social distance monitoring, an algorithm is developed using object detection method. Here, CNN based object detector is explored to detect human presence. The object detector’s output is used for calculating distances between each pair of humans detected. This approach of social distancing algorithm will red mark the persons who are getting closer than a permissible limit. Experimental results prove that CNN based object detectors with our proposed social distancing algorithm exhibit promising outcomes for monitoring social distancing in public areas.","Ansari, Mohd.

In many people, the disease is mild and self-limiting, but in a considerable number of patients, the disease may present more severe or even fatal. Therefore, determining which patients are at higher risk of developing a more severe disease is critical. Some studies have been focused on serum and fecal calprotectin to evaluate COVID-19 disease progression and possible complications. Some assumptions can be made: (1) serum calprotectin may efficiently predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients; (2) fecal calprotectin may appear high in COVID-19 patients due to the double hit mechanism to the intestine (inflammatory and ischemic); (3) a relationship between the complement system and neutrophil activation contributes to the procoagulant status seen in COVID-19 patients; (4) some patients may develop severe gastro-intestinal complications and fecal calprotectin can be used to monitor intestinal disease activity levels.","Giuffrè, Mauro; Vetrugno, Luigi; Di Bella, Stefano; Moretti, Rita; Berretti, Debora; Crocè, Lory Saveria",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9080956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442092/,427

An ARD outbreak caused by HAdV-7 that involved 739 college students was reported in this article. To better understand the underlying cause of this large-scale epidemic, virus strains were isolated from infected patients and sequence variations of the whole genome sequence were detected. Evolutionary trees and alignment results indicated that the major capsid protein genes hexon and fibre were strongly conserved among serotype 7 strains in China at that time. Instead, the HAdV-7 strains presented three thymine deletions in the virus associated RNA (VA RNA) II terminal region. We also found that the mutation might lead to increased mRNA expression of an adjacent gene, L1 52/55K, and thus promoted faster growth. These findings suggest that sequence variation of VA RNA II gene was a potential cause of such a severe HAdV-7 infection and this gene should be a new-emerging factor to be monitored for better understanding of HAdV-7 infection.","Yang, Xiaoxia; Wang, Qiongshu; Liang, Beibei; Wu, Fuli; Li, Hao; Liu, Hongbo; Sheng, Chunyu; Ma, Qiuxia; Yang, Chaojie; Xie, Jing; Li, Peng; Jia, Leili; Wang, Ligui; Du, Xinying; Qiu, Shaofu; Song, Hongbin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28225804/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172519,427

An effective self-made Chinese medicine formula, Xiaoyu Xiezhuo Drink (XXD), displayed therapeutic effects on AKI. However, the compositions and underlying mechanisms of XXD remain to be elucidated. In this study, we used the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography method coupled with hybrid triple quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS) to investigate the chemical components in XXD. Then, the absorbable components of XXD were identified based on the five principles and inputted into the SwissTargetPrediction and STITCH databases to identify the drug targets. AKI-related targets were collected from the GenCLiP 3, GeneCards, and DisGeNET databases. The crossover genes of XXD and AKI were identified for functional enrichment analysis. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of crossover genes was constructed, followed by the identification of hub genes. Subsequently, the effects and potential mechanisms of XXD on AKI predicted by the network pharmacology and bioinformatics analyses were experimentally validated in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury-induced AKI aged mouse models. A total of 122 components in XXD were obtained; among them, 58 components were found that could be absorbed in the blood. There were 800 potential drug targets predicted from the 58 absorbable components in AKI which shared 36 crossover genes with AKI-related targets. The results of functional enrichment analysis indicated that crossover genes mostly associated with the response to oxidative stress and the HIF1 signaling pathway. In the PPI network analysis, 12 hub genes were identified, including ALB, IL-6, TNF, TP53, VEGFA, PTGS2, TLR4, NOS3, EGFR, PPARG, HIF1A, and HMOX1. In AKI aged mice, XXD prominently alleviated I/R injury-induced renal dysfunction, abnormal renal pathological changes, and cellular senescence, inflammation, and oxidative damage with a reduction in the expression level of the inflammatory mediator, α-SMA, collagen-1, F4/80, TP53, VEGFA, PTGS2, TLR4, NOS3, EGFR, PPARG, HIF1A, ICAM-1, TGF-β1, Smad3, and p-Smad3 and an increase of nephridial tissue p-H3, Ki67, HMOX1, MMP-9, and Smad7 levels.

This paper investigates educational differences in the changes in psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores the mechanisms of the differences. METHODS: The data were obtained from a unique two-wave panel survey conducted during the peak and waning phases of the pandemic in Hubei province, the epicenter of the pandemic in China. RESULTS: At the peak of the pandemic, individuals with different levels of education reported high and similar levels of psychological distress. As the pandemic subsided, the psychological well-being of people of all educational levels rebounded, but the recovery was greater and faster for those with tertiary education. Mediation analysis shows that neighborhood social support and evaluation of the performance of grassroots government partially explained the advantage of the more highly educated. CONCLUSION: This study reveals how social differentiation is translated into health disparities when a disaster strikes.

In this paper, we compare outcomes for two northern Italian regions which had almost simultaneous initial outbreaks: Lombardy, which had a patient-centered approach that relied on primary care physicians and hospital care, and Veneto, which focused on community-based diagnosis and care. Methods We used numerator and denominator data from public Italian government sources to calculate reported rates of COVID-19 testing/1000, COVID-19 cases/100,000 overall and for health care workers (HCWs) and non-HCWs, deaths per 100,000, and the percent of cases admitted to hospitals and ICUs for February 24-April 1, 2020. Results As of April 1, 2020, Lombardy experienced 44,733 cases and 7,539 deaths; for Veneto, the corresponding values were 9,625 and 499. The cumulative case rate was 445/100,000 for Lombardy and 196/100,000 for Veneto, a 2.3-fold difference. Mortality rates were 7.5 times higher in Lombardy than in Veneto (75/100,000 and 10/100,000, respectively). Cumulative rates of testing were nearly twice as high in Veneto and were 2.7 times higher in the first week of the epidemic. In Lombardy, 51.5% of patients were admitted, including, 5.2% to intensive care units; for Veneto, the corresponding figures were 25.1% and 4.3%, respectively. HCWs account for 14.3% of all cases in Lombardy compared with 4.4% in Veneto. In Lombardy, the rate among HCWs was 19.1 times higher than in the general population (6,924 versus 362 per 100,000), while in Veneto it was 3.9 times higher (676 versus 172/100,000). Discussion The community-based approach in Veneto appears to be associated with substantially reduced rates of cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and infection in HCWs compared with the patient-centered approach in Lombardy. Our findings suggest that the impact of COVID-19 can be reduced through strong and aggressive public health efforts to confirm and isolate cases and contacts in a timely way and to minimize unnecessary contact between HCWs and cases through home-based testing and pro-active home follow-up.","Binkin, Nancy; Salmaso, Stefania; Michieletto, Federica; Russo, Francesca",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060707,427

It is highly transmissible and represents one of the most serious pandemics in recent times, with the capacity to overwhelm any healthcare system and cause morbidity and fatality. MAIN CONTENT: The diagnosis of this disease is daunting and challenging as it is dependent on emerging clinical symptomatology that continues to increase and change very rapidly. The definitive test is the very expensive and scarce polymerase chain reaction (PCR) viral identification technique. The management has remained largely supportive and empirical, as there are no officially approved therapeutic agents, vaccines or antiviral medications for the management of the disease. Severe cases often require intensive care facilities and personnel. Yet there is paucity of facilities including the personnel required for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is against this backdrop that a review of key published reports on the pandemic in SSA and globally is made, as understanding the natural history of a disease and the documented responses to diagnosis and management is usually a key public health strategy for designing and improving as appropriate, relevant interventions. Lead findings were that responses by most nations of SSA were adhoc, paucity of public health awareness strategies and absence of legislations that would help enforce preventive measures, as well as limited facilities (including personal protective equipment) and institutional capacities to deliver needed interventions. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is real and has overwhelmed global health care system especially low-income countries of the sub-Sahara such as Nigeria.

The hypothesis is based in part on the abundant epidemiological, clinical, and experimental evidence of an association of infectious agents with autoimmune disease and observed cross‐reactivity of immune reagents with host ‘self’ antigens and microbial determinants. For our purpose, molecular mimicry is defined as similar structures shared by molecules from dissimilar genes or by their protein products. Either the molecules' linear amino acid sequences or their conformational fits may be shared, even though their origins are as separate as, for example, a virus and a normal host–self determinant. An immune response against the determinant shared by the host and virus can evoke a tissue‐specific immune response that is presumably capable of eliciting cell and tissue destruction. The probable mechanism is generation of cytotoxic cross‐reactive effector lymphocytes or antibodies that recognize specific determinants on target cells. The induction of cross‐reactivity does not require a replicating agent, and immune‐mediated injury can occur after the immunogen has been removed—a hit‐and‐run event. Hence, the viral or microbial infection that initiates the autoimmune phenomenon may not be present by the time overt disease develops. By a complementary mechanism, the microbe can induce cellular injury and release self antigens, which generate immune responses that cross‐react with additional but genetically distinct self antigens. In both scenarios, analysis of the T cells or antibodies specifically engaged in the autoimmune response and disease provides a fingerprint for uncovering the initiating infectious agent.—Oldstone, M.

The role of procalcitonin (PCT) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has not been highlighted so far. We described retrospectively eight cases of sepsis from pneumonia of various microbiological aetiologies including two due to SARS, compared their PCT concentrations and provided further descriptors of SARS as a viral pneumonia. Results. Like any viral pneumonia, patients with SARS had low PCT levels in contrast to bacterial or fungal pneumonia. Conclusions. In the setting of pneumonia with a finding of low PCT, testing for SARS should be considered, especially if there is a positive travel or contact history. During a SARS epidemic, we also strongly advocate isolating all suspected community acquired pneumonia with a low PCT level.","Chua, Ai Ping; Lee, Kang Hoe",J Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445304000180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15066330/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445304000180,427
