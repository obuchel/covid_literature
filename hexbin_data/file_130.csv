266,HIV/AIDS prevention in China: A challenge for the new millennium,2005-05-11,"China’s first HIV infection was officially reported in 1985 and by the end of 1996, there may have been up to 200,000 people affected nationwide. In 2001, this figure probably exceeded 600,000. By 2003, the predicted number of HIV cases had reached 1.5 million. At least 80,000 individuals now have fullblown AIDS. China may soon have the largest HIV-infected population in the world, possibly 6 million cases by 2005. With infection rates rising at about 30% per year, it is feared this figure might exceed 10 million by 2010. Although the Chinese government was initially slow to accept the problem, in the late 1990s definite changes began occurring. In 2003 Premier Wen Jiabao publicly shook the hand of an AIDS patient and his government promised to introduce a range of free HIV-related services. Large preventive education campaigns are now underway. Unfortunately, there will still be many obstacles in controlling the epidemic and preventing further spread of this disease. Without doubt, China faces a serious predicament in the new millennium, and one which will pose numerous challenges for preventive medicine.","Smith, Derek R.; Wei, Ning; Leggat, Peter A.; Wang, Rui-Sheng",Environ Health Prev Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2723251/,130
267,Emerging zoonotic diseases: An opportunity to apply the concepts of nidality and one-medicine,2005-09-11,"The use of animals as sentinels of human disease revolves around the concept of nidality. That is, an agent of disease occupies a particular ecologic niche and alterations in that niche will change the function of that agent relative to traditional host-agent-environment relationships. Nidality is a derivation of the root word nidus. Nidus is defined as a nest or breeding place, particularly a place where microbes such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, as well as other organisms and larger parasites, are located and multiply. Application of the concept of nidality and development of prevention strategies has most frequently been associated with military campaigns and interruption of tick-borne infections. Modern usage of the phrase “one-medicine” was popularized in the United States and Europe by Calvin Schwabe and the concept is attributed to Rudolph Virchow. It is applied today to the study of zoonotic disease and interventions in rural agricultural communities that share close living arrangements between people and their families, their pastoral work environment, and the animals for which they care. Integration of the two concepts of one-medicine and nidality provides an opportunity to apply a systems approach (i.e. general systems theory) to dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases in today’s global agricultural and industrial settings.","Herbold, John R.",Environ Health Prev Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2723409/,130
268,Disease ecology and the global emergence of zoonotic pathogens,2005-09-11,"The incidence and frequency of epidemic transmission of zoonotic diseases, both known and newly recognized, has increased dramatically in the past 30 years. It is thought that this dramatic disease emergence is primarily the result of the social, demographic, and environmental transformation that has occurred globally since World War II. However, the causal linkages have not been elucidated. Investigating emerging zoonotic pathogens as an ecological phenomenon can provide significant insights as to why some of these pathogens have jumped species and caused major epidemics in humans. A review of concepts and theory from biological ecology and of causal factors in disease emergence previously described suggests a general model of global zoonotic disease emergence. The model links demographic and societal factors to land use and land cover change whose associated ecological factors help explain disease emergence. The scale and magnitude of these changes are more significant than those associated with climate change, the effects of which are largely not yet understood. Unfortunately, the complex character and non-linear behavior of the human-natural systems in which host-pathogen systems are embedded makes specific incidences of disease emergence or epidemics inherently difficult to predict. Employing a complex systems analytical approach, however, may show how a few key ecological variables and system properties, including the adaptive capacity of institutions, explains the emergence of infectious diseases and how an integrated, multi-level approach to zoonotic disease control can reduce risk.","Wilcox, Bruce A.; Gubler, Duane J.",Environ Health Prev Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2723410/,130
269,Globalization and emerging governance modalities,2005-09-11,"This paper explores the possibilities for global governance effectively dealing with the international transmission of disease. First, zoonotic regulation and control pose a special case for public health agencies, and this paper proposes a propositional model for an effective public health stance. Second, globalization dynamics are briefly reviewed in terms of an emerging consensus on the need for global governance in public health. Third, a brief examination of global governance modalities suggests that a strong global governance case has distinct limitations (despite its possible justification); an exploration of contemporary directions in global governance follows. Finally, the paper examines the phenomenon of contemporary zoonotic control within the conditions of an effective regulatory regime.","Neubauer, Deane Edward",Environ Health Prev Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2723413/,130
2444,Experiences and Psychosocial Impact of West Africa Ebola Deployment on US Health Care Volunteers,2016-09-21,"Background: This qualitative study was designed to assess health care volunteers’ experiences and psychosocial impacts associated with deployment to the West Africa Ebola epidemic. Methods: In 2015, using snowball sampling, 16 US health care volunteers who had recently returned from West Africa were recruited for this study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect information associated with each phase of deployment (pre, peri, and post). Results: Participants reported that they were motivated to volunteer because of a sense of responsibility and feelings of empathy and altruism. Immediately prior to deployment, most reported fear of contagion and death, as well as doubts regarding the adequacy of their training. Family members and close friends expressed high levels of concern regarding participants’ decisions to volunteer. During the deployment, participants were fearful of exposure and reported feeling emotionally and physically exhausted. They also reported feeling frustrated by extreme resource limitations, poor management of the mission, lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and inability to provide high quality care. Upon return home, participants felt a sense of isolation, depression, stigmatization, interpersonal difficulties, and extreme stress. Conclusion: Preparedness of volunteers was suboptimal at each stage of deployment. All stakeholders, including volunteers, sponsoring organizations, government agencies, and professional organizations have a shared responsibility in ensuring that volunteers to medical missions are adequately prepared. This is especially critical for high risk deployments. Effective policies and practices need to be developed and implemented in order to protect the health and well-being of health care volunteers to the fullest extent possible.","Gershon, Robyn; Dernehl, Liza A.; Nwankwo, Ezinne; Zhi, Qi; Qureshi, Kristine",PLoS Curr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5074701/,130
3450,"What happened to health service utilization, health care expenditures, and quality of care in patients with acute pancreatitis after implementation of global budgeting in Taiwan?",2018-10-12,"AIM: Acute pancreatitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In the United States, more than 3,00,000 patients are admitted and about 20,000 die from acute pancreatitis per year. In Taiwan, the incidence rate of acute pancreatitis is 0.03% and the mortality rate among severe acute pancreatitis is 16.3%. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the global budgeting system on health service utilization, health care expenditures, and quality of care among patients with acute pancreatitis in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) was used for analysis. Data on patients with acute pancreatitis diagnosed during the period 2000 and 2001 were used as baseline data, and data from 2004 and 2005 were used as post-intervention data. The length of stay (LOS), diagnostic costs, drug cost, therapy costs, total costs, risk of readmission within 14 days, and risk of revisiting the emergency department (ED) within 3 days of discharge before and after implementation of the global budgeting system were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: Data on 2810 patients with acute pancreatitis were analyzed in this study. There was a significant difference in mean LOS before and after introduction of the global budget system (7.34 ± 0.22 days and 7.82 ± 0.22 days, respectively; P < .001)). The mean total costs before and after implementation of the global budget system were Taiwan dollars (NT$) 28,290.66 ± 1576.32 and NT$ 42,341.83 ± 2285.23, respectively. The mean rate of revisiting the ED within 3 days decreased from 9.9 ± 0.9% before adoption of global budgeting to 7.2 ± 0.6% after implementation of the system. The mean 14-day re-admission rates before and after introduction of global budgeting were 11.6 ± 1.0% and 7.9 ± 0.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The global budget system was associated with significantly longer length of stay, higher health care expenditures, and better quality of care in patients treated for acute pancreatitis.","Ko, Ya-Lin; Wang, Jyun-Wei; Hsu, Hui-Mei; Kao, Chia-Hung; Lin, Chun-Yi",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6203586/,130
3985,Severe odontogenic infections with septic progress – a constant and increasing challenge: a retrospective analysis,2019-08-02,"BACKGROUND: More than 90% of all infections in the head and neck region can be traced back to an odontogenic origin. In rare cases they can lead to sepsis, which may pose a vital threat to the patient. The purpose of this study was to analyse characteristics concerning etiology and progress of severe odontogenic infections with a fulminant development. METHODS: All patients with odontogenic infections requiring hospital admission were included in a retrospective analysis conducted from 02/2012 to 09/2017. Of 483 patients 16 patients (13 male, 3 female) showed severe exacerbation with septic progress. The average age was 52.8 years. All patients underwent at least one surgical procedure that involved an extraoral incision and drainage as well as high volume irrigation intraoperatively. At least one revision was required for four of the patients. Three patients showed an exceedingly severe disease progression with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and circulatory arrest. Antibiotic treatment was adjusted according to the results of an antibiogram and resistogram. Irrigation with saline was done several times a day. RESULTS: Sixteen patients showed odontogenic infections that spread over multiple maxillo-facial and cervical regions accompanied by septic laboratory signs. All these patients needed intensive care and a tracheostomy. The hospitalization period was 27.8 days on average. In 16 cases risk factors for the development of odontogenic abscesses like diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic alcohol and nicotine abuse, rheumatism and poor oral hygiene were present. Intraoperative swabs showed a typical polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic spectrum of oral bacteria, especially anaerobes and streptococci, mainly Streptocococcus viridans. CONCLUSION: Odontogenic infections with fulminant progression should be treated based on clinical and imaging data with immediate surgical incision and drainage including elimination of odontogenic foci as well as intensified intra- and postoperative irrigation. If needed, repeat imaging followed by further incisions should be performed. Immediate antibiotic treatment adapted to the antibiogram is of utmost importance. A combination of tazobactam and piperacillin has proven to be a good first choice and can be recommended for abscesses that spread over multiple levels with initial signs of severe infections.","Weise, H.; Naros, A.; Weise, C.; Reinert, S.; Hoefert, S.",BMC Oral Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6679486/,130
4597,Out of Pocket Expenditure for Sick Newborn Care in Referral Hospitals of Nepal,2020-01-24,"BACKGROUND: Hip osteoarthritis (HOA) is the most common hip disorder and a major cause of disability in the adult population, with an estimated prevalence of end-stage disease and total hip replacement. Thus, the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the early stages of the disease in young adults are crucial to reduce the incidence of end-stage HOA. The purpose of this study was to determine whether (1) a relationship among the inflammatory status of labrum and synovium collected from patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) would exist; and (2) to investigate the associations among the histopathological features of joint tissues, the pre-operative symptoms and the post-operative outcomes after arthroscopic surgery. METHODS: Joint tissues from 21 patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for FAI were collected and their histological and immunohistochemical features were correlated with clinical parameters. RESULTS: Synovial mononuclear cell infiltration was observed in 25% of FAI patients, inversely correlated with the hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS) pain and function subscales and with the absolute and relative change in total HOOS. All the labral samples showed some pattern of degeneration and 67% of the samples showed calcium deposits. The total labral score was associated with increased CD68 positive cells in the synovium. The presence of labral calcifications, along with the chondral damage worsened the HOOS post-op symptoms (adjusted R-square = 0.76 p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a relationship between the histologic labral features, the synovial inflammation, and the cartilage condition at the time of FAI. The presence of labral calcifications, along with the cartilage damage and the synovitis negatively affects the post-operative outcomes in patients with FAI.","Trisolino, Giovanni; Favero, Marta; Dallari, Dante; Tassinari, Enrico; Traina, Francesco; Otero, Miguel; Goldring, Steven R.; Goldring, Mary B.; Carubbi, Chiara; Ramonda, Roberta; Stilli, Stefano; Grigolo, Brunella; Olivotto, Eleonora",J Orthop Surg Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7049200/,130

Through the development of novel genetic methodologies, including a better understanding of pathogen biology, pathogenic mechanisms, advances in vaccine development, designing new therapeutic drugs, and optimization of diagnostic tools, significant infectious diseases are now better controlled. Here, we briefly describe recent reports in the literature concentrating on infectious disease control. The focus of this review is to describe the molecular methods widely used in the diagnosis, prevention, and control of infectious diseases with regard to the innovation of molecular techniques. Since the list of pathogenic microorganisms is extensive, we emphasize some of the major human infectious diseases (AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, rotavirus, herpes virus, viral hepatitis, and dengue fever). As a consequence of these developments, infectious diseases will be more accurately and effectively treated; safe and effective vaccines are being developed and rapid detection of infectious agents now permits countermeasures to avoid potential outbreaks and epidemics. But, despite considerable progress, infectious diseases remain a strong challenge to human survival.","França, R. F. O.; da Silva, C. C.; De Paula, S.

Influenza is an underestimated contributor to morbidity and mortality. Population knowledge regarding influenza and its vaccination has a key role in enhancing vaccination coverage. OBJECTIVES. This study aimed to identify the gaps of knowledge among Jordanian population towards influenza and its vaccine, and to identify the major determinants of accepting seasonal influenza vaccine in adults and children in Jordan. METHODS. This was a cross-sectional study that enrolled 941 randomly selected adults in Amman, Jordan. A four-section questionnaire was used which included questions about the sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge about influenza and the factors that affect seasonal influenza vaccine acceptance and refusal. RESULTS. Only 47.3% of the participants were considered knowledgeable. About half of the participants (51.9%) correctly identified the main influenza preventative measures. Lack of knowledge about the important role of seasonal influenza vaccine in disease prevention was observed. Low vaccination rate (20% of adults) was reported. The most critical barrier against vaccination in adults and children was the concern about the safety and the efficacy of the vaccine, while the most important predictors for future vaccination in adults and children were physician recommendation and government role. In children, the inclusion of the vaccine within the national immunization program was an important determinant of vaccine acceptance. CONCLUSION. Formulating new strategies to improve the population’s level of knowledge, assuring the population about the safety and the efficacy of the vaccine and the inclusion of the vaccine within the national immunization program are the essential factors to enhance vaccination coverage in Jordan.","Abu-rish, Eman Y; Elayeh, Eman R; Mousa, Lubabah A; Butanji, Yasser K; Albsoul-Younes, Abla M",Fam Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188315/,130

12960,Methylmercury toxic mechanism related to protein degradation and chemokine transcription,2020-07-17,"BACKGROUND: The Elliot wave principle commonly characterizes the impulsive and corrective wave trends for both financial market trends and electrocardiograms. The impulsive wave trends of electrocardiograms can annotate several wave components of heart-beats including pathological heartbeat waveforms. The stopping time inquires which ordinal element satisfies the assumed mathematical condition within a numerical set. The proposed work constitutes several algorithmic states in reinforcement learning from the stopping time decision, which determines the impulsive wave trends. Each proposed algorithmic state is applicable to any relevant algorithmic state in reinforcement learning with fully numerical explanations. Because commercial electrocardiographs still misinterpret myocardial infarctions from extraordinary electrocardiograms, a novel algorithm needs to be developed to evaluate myocardial infarctions. Moreover, differential diagnosis for right ventricle infarction is required to contraindicate a medication such as nitroglycerin. METHODS: The proposed work implements the stopping time theory to impulsive wave trend distribution. The searching process of the stopping time theory is equivalent to the actions toward algorithmic states in reinforcement learning. The state value from each algorithmic state represents the numerically deterministic annotated results from the impulsive wave trend distribution. The shape of the impulsive waveform is evaluated from the interoperable algorithmic states via least-first-power approximation and approximate entropy. The annotated electrocardiograms from the impulsive wave trend distribution utilize a structure of neural networks to approximate the isoelectric baseline amplitude value of the electrocardiograms, and detect the conditions of myocardial infarction. The annotated results from the impulsive wave trend distribution consist of another reinforcement learning environment for the evaluation of impulsive waveform direction. RESULTS: The accuracy to discern myocardial infarction was found to be 99.2754% for the data from the comma-separated value format files, and 99.3579% for those containing representative beats. The clinical dataset included 276 electrocardiograms from the comma-separated value files and 623 representative beats. CONCLUSIONS: Our study aims to support clinical interpretation on 12-channel electrocardiograms. The proposed work is suitable for a differential diagnosis under infarction in the right ventricle to avoid contraindicated medication during emergency. An impulsive waveform that is affected by myocardial infarction or the electrical direction of electrocardiography is represented as an inverse waveform.","Park, Jong-Rul; Chung, Sung Phil; Hwang, Sung Yeon; Shin, Tae Gun; Park, Jong Eun",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7472590/,130

It is difficult to treat, and half of patients may need artificial joint replacement, resulting in a considerable economic burden and a reduction in quality of life. Hormones are one of the major causes of osteonecrosis and high doses of corticosteroids are considered the most dangerous factor. Because of the complexity of treatment, we still need a better animal model that can be widely used in drug development and testing. Tree shrews are more closely related to primates than rodents. As such, we constructed a successful tree shrew model to establish and evaluate steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON). We found that low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) combined with high-dose methylprednisolone (MPS) over 12 weeks could be used to establish a tree shrew model with femoral head necrosis. Serum biochemical and histological analyses showed that an ideal model was obtained. Thus, this work provides a useful animal model for the study of SAON and for the optimization of treatment methods.","Chen, Qi; Ma, Zhao-Xia; Xia, Li-Bin; Ye, Zhen-Ni; Liu, Bao-Ling; Ma, Tie-Kun; Bao, Peng-Fei; Wu, Xing-Fei; Yu, Cong-Tao; Ma, Dai-Ping; Han, Yuan-Yuan; Wang, Wen-Guang; Kuang, De-Xuan; Dai, Jie-Jie; Zhang, Rong-Ping; Hu, Min; Shi, Hong; Wang, Wen-Lin; Li, Yan-Jiao",Zool Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7475020/,130

18644,20 years on: the legacy of Daksha Emson for perinatal psychiatry,2021-06-29,"Waddlia chondrophila is an emerging pathogen that has been implicated in numerous unpropitious pregnancy events in humans and ruminants. Taking into account its association with abortigenic events, possible modes of transmission, and future risk, immediate clinical measures are required to prevent widespread damage caused by this organism and hence this study. Here, a subtractive proteomics approach was employed to identify druggable proteins of W. chondrophila. Considering the essential genes, antibiotic resistance proteins, and virulence factors, 676 unique important proteins were initially identified for this bacterium. Afterward, NCBI BLASTp performed against human proteome identified 223 proteins that were further pushed into KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS) for automatic annotation. Using the information from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database 14 Waddlia specific metabolic pathways were identified with respect to humans. Analyzing the data from KAAS and KEGG databases, forty-eight metabolic pathway-dependent, and seventy metabolic pathway independent proteins were identified. Standalone BLAST search against DrugBank FDA approved drug targets revealed eight proteins that are finally considered druggable proteins. Prediction of three-dimensional structures was done for the eight proteins through homology modeling and the Ramachandran plot model showed six models as a valid prediction. Finally, virtual screening against MurB protein was performed using FDA approved drugs to employ the drug repositioning strategy. Three drugs showed promising docking results that can be used for therapeutic purposes against W. chondrophila following the clinical validation of the study.","Chowdhury, Umar Faruq; Saba, Abdullah Al; Sufi, Abu Sufian; Khan, Akib Mahmud; Sharmin, Ishrat; Sultana, Aziza; Islam, Md Ohedul",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239728/,130

19951,Exploring the barriers to Pap smear test in Iranian women: a qualitative study,2021-08-06,"BACKGROUND: The obesity paradox has been recently demonstrated in trauma patients, where improved survival was associated with overweight and obese patients compared to patients with normal weight, despite increased morbidity. Little is known whether this effect is mediated by lower injury severity. We aim to explore the association between body mass index (BMI) and renal trauma injury grade, morbidity, and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of adults with renal trauma was conducted using 2013–2016 National Trauma Data Bank. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess outcomes of interest across BMI categories with normal weight as reference, while adjusting for relevant covariates including kidney injury grade. RESULTS: We analyzed 15181 renal injuries. Increasing BMI above normal progressively decreased the risk of high-grade renal trauma (HGRT). Subgroup analysis showed that this relationship was maintained in blunt injury, but there was no association in penetrating injury. Overweight (OR 1.02, CI 0.83–1.25, p = 0.841), class I (OR 0.92, CI 0.71–1.19, p = 0.524), and class II (OR 1.38, CI 0.99–1.91, p = 0.053) obesity were not protective against mortality, whereas class III obesity (OR 1.46, CI 1.03–2.06, p = 0.034) increased mortality odds. Increasing BMI by category was associated with a stepwise increase in odds of acute kidney injury, cardiovascular events, total hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit LOS, and ventilator days. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing BMI was associated with decreased risk of HGRT in blunt trauma. Overweight and obesity were associated with increased morbidity but not with a protective effect on mortality. The obesity paradox does not exist in kidney trauma when injury grade is accounted for.","Hakam, Nizar; Nabavizadeh, Behnam; Sadighian, Michael J.; Holler, Jordan; Shibley, Patrick; Li, Kevin D.; Low, Patrick; Amend, Gregory; Stein, Deborah M.; Breyer, Benjamin N.",World J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8351221/,130
20939,Income and conversion handicaps: estimating the impact of child chronic illness/disability on family income and the extra cost of child chronic illness/child disability in Ireland using a standard of living approach,2021-09-09,"BACKGROUND: Personalizing mechanical ventilation requires the development of reliable bedside monitoring techniques. The multiple-breaths nitrogen washin–washout (MBNW) technique is currently available to measure end-expiratory lung volume (EELV(MBNW)), but the precision of the technique may be poor, with percentage errors ranging from 28 to 57%. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the reliability of a novel MBNW bedside system using fast mainstream sensors to assess EELV in an experimental acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) model, using computed tomography (CT) as the gold standard. The secondary aims of the study were: (1) to evaluate trending ability of the novel system to assess EELV; (2) to evaluate the reliability of estimated alveolar recruitment induced by positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) changes computed from EELV(MBNW), using CT as the gold standard. RESULTS: Seven pigs were studied in 6 experimental conditions: at baseline, after experimental ARDS and during a decremental PEEP trial at PEEP 16, 12, 6 and 2 cmH(2)O. EELV was computed at each PEEP step by both the MBNW technique (EELV(MBNW)) and CT (EELV(CT)). Repeatability was assessed by performing replicate measurements. Alveolar recruitment between two consecutive PEEP levels after lung injury was measured with CT (Vrec(CT)), and computed from EELV measurements (Vrec(MBNW)) as ΔEELV minus the product of ΔPEEP by static compliance. EELV(MBNW) and EELV(CT) were significantly correlated (R(2) = 0.97). An acceptable non-constant bias between methods was identified, slightly decreasing toward more negative values as EELV increased. The conversion equation between EELV(MBNW) and EELV(CT) was: EELV(MBNW) = 0.92 × EELV(CT) + 36. The 95% prediction interval of the bias amounted to ± 86 mL and the percentage error between both methods amounted to 13.7%. The median least significant change between repeated measurements amounted to 8% [CI(95%): 4–10%]. EELV(MBNW) adequately tracked EELV(CT) changes over time (concordance rate amounting to 100% [CI(95%): 87%–100%] and angular bias amounting to − 2° ± 10°). Vrec(MBNW) and Vrec(CT) were significantly correlated (R(2) = 0.92). A non-constant bias between methods was identified, slightly increasing toward more positive values as Vrec increased.

METHODS: Within the context of the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health case-control study of under 5 pneumonia, we investigated the etiology of World Health Organization-defined severe/very severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization in South African HIV-infected children. Nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs and blood, collected from cases and age- and season-matched HIV-infected controls attending outpatient antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics, were analyzed using molecular diagnostic methods. Cases were also investigated for tuberculosis. Etiologic fractions among cases with radiologically confirmed pneumonia were derived using Bayesian analytic techniques. RESULTS: Of 115 HIV-infected cases, 89 (77.4%) had radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Severe immunosuppression (adjusted odds ratio, 32.60; 95% confidence interval, 7.25–146.64) was significantly associated with radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (46.4% vs. 77.4%) and ART (28.2% vs. 83.1%) coverage were significantly lower in cases compared with ART-clinic controls. An etiologic agent was identified in 99.0% of the radiologically confirmed cases. The ‘top 4’ pathogens associated with radiologically confirmed pneumonia were Pneumocystis jirovecii [23.0%; 95% credible interval (CrI), 12.4%–31.5%], Staphylococcus aureus (10.6%; 95% CrI, 2.2%–20.2%), pneumococcus (9.5%; 95% CrI, 2.2%–18.0%) and respiratory syncytial virus (9.3%; 95% CrI, 2.2%–14.6%). Bacteremia (6.7%) and in-hospital death (10.1%) were frequent among those with radiologically confirmed disease. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumocystis jirovecii, S. aureus, pneumococcus and respiratory syncytial virus contribute a considerable burden of radiologically confirmed pneumonia in South African HIV-infected children under 5 years. Expediting access to ART and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis would decrease the burden of pneumonia in these children.","Moore, David P.; Baillie, Vicky L.; Mudau, Azwifarwi; Wadula, Jeannette; Adams, Tanja; Mangera, Shafeeka; Verwey, Charl; Sipambo, Nosisa; Liberty, Afaaf; Prosperi, Christine; Higdon, Melissa M.; Haddix, Meredith; Hammitt, Laura L.; Feikin, Daniel R.; O’Brien, Katherine L.; Deloria Knoll, Maria; Murdoch, David R.; Simões, Eric A.

Formally, an input sequence x is hopeful if there exists some output sequence y such that the induced computation [Formula: see text] satisfies [Formula: see text], and a system ge-realizes [Formula: see text] if it generates a computation that satisfies [Formula: see text] on all hopeful input sequences. ge-synthesis is particularly relevant when the notion of correctness is multi-valued (rather than Boolean), and thus we seek systems of the highest possible quality, and when synthesizing autonomous systems, which interact with unexpected environments and are often only expected to do their best. We study ge-synthesis in Boolean and multi-valued settings. In both, we suggest and solve various definitions of ge-synthesis, corresponding to different ways a designer may want to take hopefulness into account. We show that in all variants, ge-synthesis is not computationally harder than traditional synthesis, and can be implemented on top of existing tools. Our algorithms are based on careful combinations of nondeterministic and universal automata. We augment systems that ge-realize their specifications by monitors that provide satisfaction information. In the multi-valued setting, we provide both a worst-case analysis and an expectation-based one, the latter corresponding to an interaction with a stochastic environment.","Almagor, Shaull; Kupferman, Orna",Computer Aided Verification,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363190/,130

This study presents a statistical model looking at the impacts of COVID-19 on household waste and waste collection services and the prevalence of self-disposing in response to these impacts. Qualitative household data were collected from Guyana and Nigeria looking at household perspectives on their waste management issues since the emergence of COVID-19. Statistical models were developed using limited-dependent binary logistic regression. The models showed for each country, different factors contributing to the likelihood of self-disposing. For Guyana, the change in waste collection schedule and the household proximity to landfills increases the likelihood of self-disposing while in Nigeria, the increase in household waste increases the likelihood of self-disposing. The results also showed that households who regularly engage in recycling activities are less likely to self-dispose. The study concludes that COVID-19 has disrupted household waste disposal and had contributed to increasing instances in self-dumping. COVID-19 seems to be fostering the informal waste sector which may require a shift in the current operation and policies for the solid waste management sector.","Moonsammy, Stephan; Oyedotun, Temitope D.

Under the Act, mortgage borrowers are allowed to cease making payments if their income was negatively impacted by Covid-19. Importantly, borrowers were not required to demonstrate proof of impaction, either currently or retrospectively. Exploring the economic implications of this policy, this study uses an experimental design to first identify strategic forbearance incidence, and then to quantify where the forborne mortgage payment dollars were spent. Our results suggest strategic mortgage forbearance can be significantly reduced, saving taxpayers billions of dollars in potential losses, simply by requiring a 1-page attestation with lender recourse for borrowers wishing to engage in COVID-19 related mortgage payment cessation programs. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of these forborne mortgage payments range from enhancing the financial safety net for distressed borrowers by increasing precautionary savings, to buying necessities, to equity investing and debt consolidation.","Anderson, Jackson T.; Harrison, David M.; Seiler, Michael J.",J Real Estate Finan Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8120016/,130

Here, we present the case of a 45‐year‐old male patient with severe multiple sclerosis without disease‐modifying therapy who was admitted for COVID‐19 pneumonia, treated with dexamethasone and Remdesivir, and then discharged. Subsequently, the patient was readmitted twice in the next month for complications arising from worsening dysphagia, musculoskeletal weakness, and neurogenic bladder. On the first of these re‐admissions, the patient presented with altered mental status, secondary to uremic encephalopathy due to acute kidney injury precipitated by lack of adequate PO hydration. This admission was complicated by multiple pulmonary emboli necessitating transfer from the floor to the ICU, in addition to central line placement, candidemia, Pseudomonas urinary tract infection, and hemorrhagic cystitis. Despite this protracted course, the patient's mental function and orientation slowly improved as his renal function improved secondary to intravenous fluid administration. Because the patient's worsening dysphagia and weakness made adequate hydration by mouth untenable, the possibility of PEG tube placement was broached with the patient and his family. After consent was obtained, a PEG tube was placed, and the patient was subsequently discharged home under the care of his family. Two days after discharge, however, the patient presented to the Emergency Department, again with altered mental status due to uremic encephalopathy secondary to dehydration. During this admission, blood cultures also revealed Pseudomonal sepsis, likely secondary to recurrent UTI ultimately caused by neurogenic bladder. Accordingly, a suprapubic catheter was placed, and the care team worked with the patient's family to develop an adequate hydration regime before discharge. This case study suggests that COVID‐19 may exacerbate ongoing neuropathological processes in patients with chronic neurological disease, and illustrates strategies clinicians and patients use to grapple with these changes.","Jaisankar, Prashanth; Kucera, Aurelia; Chin, Justin; Lomiguen, Christine",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239935/,130

The corpus is drawn from four popular social media platforms and examined through a multimodal discourse analytic lens. The dominant memetic trends are elucidated and shown to rely programmatically on nested (multimodal) voices, whether compatible or divergent, as is the case with the dissociative echoing of individuals wearing peculiar masks or the dissociative parodic echoing of their collective voice. The theoretical thrust of this analysis is that, as some memes are (re)posted across social media (sometimes going viral), the previous voice(s) – of the meme subject/author/poster – can be re-purposed (e.g. ridiculed) or unwittingly distorted. Overall, this investigation offers new theoretical and methodological implications for the study of memes: it indicates the usefulness of the notions of multimodal voicing, intertextuality and echoing as research apparatus; and it brings to light the epistemological ambiguity in lay and academic understandings of memes, the voices behind which cannot always be categorically known.","Dynel, Marta",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8280556/,130

METHODS: A digital questionnaire with both closed and open questions was distributed via various online platforms and the newsletter of the Diabetes Association in the Netherlands. Information was collected on: 1) willingness to participate; 2) preferences about the method of participation; 3) influencing factors on participation, including motivation, competence, resources, social influences, and outcome expectations; 4) background characteristics. RESULTS: 160 questionnaires were analysed. More than three quarter of the respondents intend to be involved in patient participation. Most respondents prefer solo participation methods over group participation, respectively 93% and 46%. Half of the respondents feel that they have sufficient knowledge to participate, and 40% feels that they can provide valuable input. As compensation for participation, participants prefer to use new technologies for free. CONCLUSION: As people with diabetes type 2 differ in their preferences for moments and methods of participation, it is recommended to offer different methods of participation and types of compensation in the process from development to application of eHealth.","van Leersum, Catharina M.; Bults, Marloes; Sloof, Michelle; Pouwe, Fabiënne; van Manen, Jeannette G.; Konijnendijk, Annemieke A.

58540,A Psychometric Analysis of Fear of COVID-19 Scale in India,2021-10-04,"Abstract—International tourism was among the sectors of the global economy most affected by the COVID‑19 pandemic. The aim of the study is to identify the differences in the dynamics of the tourist flow in Finland and Estonia during the first eight months of 2020 compared to 2019, as well as changes in the structure of the inbound tourist flow to these countries. The particular interest in studying tourist flows in Finland and Estonia stems from the fact that over the past two decades, they were among the top ten countries in the world in terms of the volume of outbound tourism by Russians, as well as among the leaders in this indicator among European Union countries, which is directly related to their neighboring position with Russia. Tourism in Estonia and Finland went through a rather difficult period of spring quarantine, and its recovery in the summer began with domestic tourism. There has also been an increase in the inbound tourist flow. At the same time, the best dynamics was demonstrated by the flow of tourists from neighboring countries that are EU members, the border with which for tourists was already partially open in summer 2020. The adjacent territories of neighboring countries are part of cross-border tourist and recreational regions, within which tourist flows have been recovering faster than tourist exchange with other, geographically more remote states. This conclusion gives hope for a fairly quick recovery of cross-border tourist exchange between Russia and neighboring countries after the postpandemic opening of borders.","Ivanov, I.

We here systematically investigated the factors that might contribute to secondary infection. By clinical examination index analysis of patients, combined with the integrative analysis with RNA-seq analysis in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolated shortly from initial infection, this study showed that the antibiotic catabolic process and myeloid cell homeostasis were activated while the T-cell response were relatively repressed in those with the risk of secondary infection. Further monitoring analysis of immune cell and liver injury analysis showed that the risk of secondary infection was accompanied by severe lymphocytopenia at the intermediate and late stages and liver injury at the early stages of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the metagenomics analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the microbial culture analysis, to some extent, showed that the severe pneumonia-related bacteria have already existed in the initial infection.","Guo, Mingquan; Gao, Menglu; Gao, Jing; Zhang, Tengfei; Jin, Xin; Fan, Jian; Wang, Qianying; Li, Xin; Chen, Jian; Zhu, Zhaoqin",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514874/,130

The exceptionally long (60 residues) third complementarity-determining region of the heavy chain (CDR H3) of NC-Cow1 forms a mini domain (knob) on an extended stalk that navigates through the dense glycan shield on Env to target a small footprint on the gp120 CD4 receptor binding site with no contact of the other CDRs to the rest of the Env trimer. These findings illustrate, in molecular detail, how an unusual vaccine-induced cow bnAb to HIV Env can neutralize with high potency and breadth.","Stanfield, Robyn L; Berndsen, Zachary T; Huang, Ruiqi; Sok, Devin; Warner, Gabrielle; Torres, Jonathan L; Burton, Dennis R; Ward, Andrew B; Wilson, Ian A; Smider, Vaughn V",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba0468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32518821/,130

Technically in detecting SLN; radioactive substance, dyers or both are used. During the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, delayed images were not taken in lymphoscintigraphy to reduce the risk of transmission by shortening the waiting time in our center. In this study, the effects of early and delayed lymphoscintigraphic images and only early images on our clinical practice were evaluated. METHODS We investigated the data of 147 patients in this study who underwent SLNB due to early-stage breast cancer at our institute during the COVID-19 pandemic period (PP) (March/April/May 2020) and within 3 months before the pandemic were evaluated. RESULTS Patients were divided into two groups, before pandemic (BP) and PP. BP consisted of patients whose early and delayed images were taken in lymphoscintigraphy whereas PP consisted of those with early images only. There were 74 patients in the BP group and 73 patients in the PP group. Early phase increased uptake was not observed in 23 patients, and increased uptake was obtained from 22 of these patients with delayed imaging in BP period. In PP, increased uptake was not observed in 12 patients. SLN was not detected in 2 patients in the BP group and 7 in the PP group. It was found that the sensitivity, NPV and accuracy of the SLNB procedure performed after taking delayed images was higher. CONCLUSIONS In the present study, we believe that if technically possible, delayed images taken during the lymphoscintigraphy can assist the surgeon in terms of SLN detection and the number of SLNs removed.","Yüksel, Cemil; Çulcu, Serdar; Doğan, Lütfi",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,https://doi.org/10.1080/08941939.2020.1859022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33322956/,130

However, due to limitations in the availability of autologous tissue or because of the complications that may ensue from harvesting it, autologous reconstruction may be impractical to perform or too costly in terms of patient donor-site morbidity. The field of tissue engineering has long held promise to alleviate these shortcomings. Scaffolds are the structural building blocks of tissue-engineered constructs, akin to the extracellular matrix within native tissues. Commonly used scaffolds include allogenic or xenogenic decellularized tissue, synthetic or naturally derived hydrogels, and synthetic biodegradable nonhydrogel polymeric scaffolds. Embryonic, induced pluripotent, and mesenchymal stem cells also hold immense potential for regenerative purposes. Chemical signals including growth factors and cytokines may be harnessed to augment wound healing and tissue regeneration. Tissue engineering is already clinically prevalent in the fields of breast augmentation and reconstruction, skin substitutes, wound healing, auricular reconstruction, and bone, cartilage, and nerve grafting. Future directions for tissue engineering in plastic surgery include the development of prevascularized constructs and rationally designed scaffolds, the use of stem cells to regenerate organs and tissues, and gene therapy.","Golas, Alyssa Reiffel; Hernandez, Karina A; Spector, Jason A",Aesthetic plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00266-013-0255-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24378377/,130

Small molecule inhibitors of this interaction have not only provided strong evidence for blocking the protein-protein interaction, but are also extremely useful as biological probes and ultimately as novel therapeutics. Here, a comprehensive review of the patented small molecule inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction are provided. These inhibitors are divided into eight classes of compounds that include cis-imidazolines, benzodiazepines, fused indoles, substituted piperazines, substituted piperidines, aryl boronic acids, spiro-indoles, and alpha-helix mimetic compounds. The best documented class of compounds, cis-imidazolines (e.g., Nutlins) are selective and potent inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction, and selected examples exhibit potency in the nanomolar range. Nutlins induce apoptosis in p53 wild-type cells and show in vivo efficacy in mice xenograft models. Additional strategies briefly discussed in this review, and which are under current exploration in targeting the p53 pathway, include the inhibition of MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitylation and restoration of DNA-binding activity of mutant p53 protein using small molecules.","Deng, Jinxia; Dayam, Raveendra; Neamati, Nouri",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,https://doi.org/10.1517/13543776.16.2.165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20141510/,130

Addressing this question, we explored how individuals with greater COVID-19 concern perceive migrants as a greater threat and show prejudice against them, indirectly through the mechanism of need for cognitive closure and binding moral foundations.This study was conducted in two European countries: Malta and Italy. Six hundred and seventy-six individuals participated in this quantitative study (Malta: N = 204; Italy N = 472). Results from this study showed that the need for cognitive closure and binding moral foundations mediate the relationship between COVID-19 concern and prejudice against migrants in both countries. When testing the three binding moral foundations (loyalty, authority, and purity), the authority foundation seems to be the most consistent predictor.The implications of the findings contribute to theories about how situational uncertainty caused by COVID-19, together with the need for epistemic certainty and binding morality, contribute to increased prejudiced attitudes against migrants.","Bianco, Fleur; Kosic, Ankica; Pierro, Antonio",The Journal of social psychology,https://doi.org/10.1080/00224545.2021.1900046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33906584/,130

OBJECTIVES To assess the ability of plasma and urine NGAL to predict severe AKI in adult critically ill patients. METHODS Prospective-cohort study consisting of 632 consecutive patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Samples were analyzed by Triage immunoassay for NGAL expression. The primary outcome measure was occurrence of AKI based on Risk-Injury-Failure (RIFLE) classification during the first week of ICU stay. A total of 171 (27%) patients developed AKI. Of these 67, 48, and 56 were classified as RIFLE R, I, and F, respectively. Plasma and urine NGAL values at ICU admission were significantly related to AKI severity. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for plasma and urine NGAL were for RIFLE R (0.77 ± 0.05 and 0.80 ± 0.04, respectively), RIFLE I (0.80 ± 0.06 and 0.85 ± 0.04, respectively), and RIFLE F (0.86 ± 0.06 and 0.88 ± 0.04, respectively) and comparable with those of admission estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (0.84 ± 0.04, 0.87 ± 0.04, and 0.92 ± 0.04, respectively). Plasma and urine NGAL significantly contributed to the accuracy of the ""most efficient clinical model"" with the best four variables including eGFR, improving the area under the curve for RIFLE F prediction to 0.96 ± 0.02 and 0.95 ± 0.01. Serial NGAL measurements did not provide additional information for the prediction of RIFLE F. CONCLUSIONS NGAL measured at ICU admission predicts the development of severe AKI similarly to serum creatinine-derived eGFR. However, NGAL adds significant accuracy to this prediction in combination with eGFR alone or with other clinical parameters and has an interesting predictive value in patients with normal serum creatinine.","de Geus, Hilde R H; Bakker, Jan; Lesaffre, Emmanuel M E H; le Noble, Jos L M L",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200908-1214oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20935115/,130

Most of such schemes, however, are applicable to small molecules and can hardly be viewed as error-free for excited state geometries. In this study, a theoretical approach is presented in which the excited state geometries of molecules can be predicted by using vibrationally resolved experimental absorption spectrum in combination with the theoretical modelling of vibrational pattern based on Franck-Condon approximation. Huang-Rhys factors have been empirically determined and used as input for revealing the structural changes occurring between the ground and the excited state geometries upon photoexcitation. Naphthalene molecule has been chosen as a test case to show the robustness of the proposed theoretical approach. Predicted 1B 2u excited state geometry of the naphthalene has similar but slightly different bond length alternation pattern when compared with the geometries calculated with CIS, B3LYP, and CC2 methods. Excited state geometries of perylene and pyrene molecules are also determined with the presented theoretical approach.

Although antihypertensive drugs are widely available, in many patients blood pressure control to guideline-recommended target values is not achieved. Several device-based approaches have been introduced to lower blood pressure; most of these strategies aim to modulate autonomic nervous system activity. Clinical trials have moved from including patients with resistant hypertension receiving intensive pharmacological treatment to including patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension in the presence or absence of antihypertensive medications. Renal sympathetic denervation is the most extensively investigated device-based therapy for hypertension, and randomized, sham-controlled trials have provided proof-of-principle data for its blood pressure-lowering efficacy. Unilateral electrical baroreflex activation, endovascular baroreflex amplification and pacemaker-mediated cardiac neuromodulation therapy have yielded promising results in observational trials, which need to be confirmed in larger, adequately powered, sham-controlled trials. Until further evidence becomes available, device-based therapy for hypertension should not be considered for routine treatment. However, when considering a device-based treatment for hypertension, the underlying pathophysiology in each patient has to be taken into consideration, and the procedural risks weighed against the cardiovascular risk attributable to the elevated blood pressure. This Review summarizes the pathophysiological rationale and the latest clinical evidence for device-based therapies for hypertension.","Lauder, Lucas; Azizi, Michel; Kirtane, Ajay J; Böhm, Michael; Mahfoud, Felix",Nature reviews.

67335,The COVID-19 pandemic and perinatal mental health.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND In order to help farmers and industries develop value-added composite and nano materials from agricultural residuals. Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were made by using a TEMPO oxidation method and celluloses were prepared by acid-base method and extracting method, which were all from corn stalk, an agricultural residual. The prepared celluloses were dissolved separately in DMAc/LiCl solvent and added CNFs of 0.0, 0.5, 1.5 and 3.0% to form all-cellulose nanocomposite, and then casted into films. Morphology, structure and properties of the nanocomposite films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and mechanical testing. RESULTS The all-cellulose nanocomposite films with different cellulose cellulose matrix exhibited a good optical transparency and layer structure. The all-cellulose nanocomposites films with the cellulose prepared by the extracting method (Composite E) exhibited a higher crystallinity, better thermal stability and higher mechanical strength than those of the all-cellulose nanocomposites films with the cellulose prepared by the acid-base method (Composite A). CONCLUSION Crystal structure of the all-cellulose nanocomposite films all presented a co-existence of Cellulose I and Cellulose II. However, on the contrary to Composite A, the diffraction intensity of Cellulose I in Composite E was higher than that of Cellulose II. This was another reason that the mechanical properties of Composite E were superior to Composite A. In addition, the mechanical properties of the all-cellulose nanocomposites films were significantly different when the addition of CNF reached 3.0% in weight, as indicated by a multiple-range comparison.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental-modified GICs were prepared by incorporation of thyme and cinnamon essential oils into the liquid phase of the cement at 5 and 10% v/v. Antimicrobial activity against selected microorganisms (Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans) was done using direct contact test. Compressive strength of the four new formulations and control group was tested using a universal testing machine while fluoride ion release was measured by ion-selective electrode at 1, 7, 14 and 28 days. Data analysis and comparisons between groups were performed using factorial and one-way ANOVA and Tukey's tests. RESULTS All newly formulated GICs exhibited significantly higher inhibitory effects against both Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans growth when compared to conventional GIC (p < 0.05). Compressive strength of 5% cinnamon-modified GIC (MPa = 160.32 ± 6.66) showed no significant difference when compared with conventional GIC (MPa = 165.7 ± 5.769) (p value > 0.05). Cumulative fluoride-releasing pattern at days 7, 14, and 28 were 10% cinnamon-GIC > 5% thyme-GIC > 5% cinnamon-GIC > 10% thyme GIC > conventional GIC. CONCLUSIONS Incorporation of 5% cinnamon oil into glass ionomer resulted in better antimicrobial effects against S. mutans and C. albicans and increased fluoride-release capacity without jeopardizing its compressive strength.

68947,A systematic scoping review of community-based interventions for the prevention of mental ill-health and the promotion of mental health in older adults in the UK.,2021-05-14,"OBJECTIVES Anastomotic complications represent a significant source of morbidity and occasionally mortality after esophagectomy. Since 2009, we have used a novel ""side-to-side: staple line-on-staple line"" (STS) technique for intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomoses, designed to create a wide-diameter esophagogastric anastomosis while preserving stomach conduit blood supply. In this study, we describe the technique and review outcomes of our institution's initial 6-year experience. METHODS An institutional database query identified 278 consecutive patients who underwent Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy using an STS esophagogastric anastomotic technique from 2009 through 2015. A retrospective review was conducted to assess outcomes with a focus on anastomotic complications. RESULTS There were a total of 8 (2.9%) anastomotic leaks in patients who underwent STS esophagogastric anastomosis, 3 of which were grade I/II leaks and required no intervention. There was a leak rate of 6.3% (2 of 32) after esophagectomy for benign conditions (both leaks occurring in 8 total patients (25%) who received surgery for end-stage achalasia) compared with a 2.4% leak rate (6 of 246) in whom esophagectomy was performed for malignancy (P = .22). Fourteen patients (5.0%) required a median of 2 dilatations for anastomotic stricture after STS anastomosis. Supplemental jejunostomy feedings were required in only 11.1% of these patients after hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS We believe this novel STS technique provides excellent results with respect to the incidence of intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomotic leak and stricture after esophagectomy. Additionally this technique has significantly reduced the need for enteral feeding after hospital discharge.","Kesler, Kenneth A; Ramchandani, Neal K; Jalal, Shadia I; Stokes, Samatha M; Mankins, Mark R; Ceppa, DuyKhanh; Birdas, Thomas J; Vardas, Panos N; Rieger, Karen M",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2018.05.088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30033105/,130

Here, a porous and crystalline oriented two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin covalent organic framework film (D-TA COF film) was formed in situ on indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) substrates under very mild conditions. The structure and morphology of D-TA COF film were characterized by means of Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction. Compared with the randomly oriented D-TA COF powder drop-coated on ITO, the photocurrent of the D-TA COF film grown on the ITO surface in situ achieved as high as ∼333-fold increase. This photocurrent can be further amplified by O2 (acting as electron acceptors). Benefiting from the fabrication in situ, D-TA COF film also exhibited tough adhesion, assuring the film was difficult to separate from the electrode. Accordingly, D-TA COF film was applied as the photoactive material to build a PEC biosensor for H2O2 detection based on coupling with large amounts of catalase (CAT) through simple adsorption. The introduced CAT catalyzed the decomposition of H2O2 to O2, leading to an enhancement of the photocurrent response. As a result, a ""signal-on"" PEC biosensor was fabricated with good sensitivity, rapid response, and high stability, and it can also detect H2O2 released from living cells. Taking into account these advantages, the D-TA COF film is expected to be an ideal photoactive material to construct various PEC biosensors, which as far as we know have not been reported.","Liu, Tingting; Cui, Lin; Zhao, Huijuan; Zhang, Xiaomei",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c15147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007157/,130

Airborne and surface pathogenic particle concentration models including the effect of two major resuspension scenarios (airflow-induced particle resuspension [AIPR] and walking-induced particle resuspension [WIPR]) were derived based on two-compartment mass balance models and validated against experimental data found in the literature. The inhalation exposure to pathogenic particles was estimated using the derived airborne concentration model, and subsequently incorporated into a dose-response model to assess the infection risk. Using the proposed risk assessment scheme, the influences of resuspension towards indoor infection transmission were examined by two hypothetical case studies. In the case of AIPR, the infection risk increased from 0 to 0.54 during 0-0.5 hours and from 0.54 to 0.57 during 0.5-4 hours. In the case of WIPR, the infection risk increased from 0 to 0.87 during 0-0.5 hours and from 0.87 to 1 during 0.5-4 hours. Sensitivity analysis was conducted based on the design-of-experiments method and showed that the factors that are related to the inspiratory rate of viable pathogens and pathogen virulence have the most significant effect on the infection probability under the occurrence of AIPR and WIPR. The risk assessment scheme could serve as an effective tool for the risk assessment of infection transmission indoors.","You, Siming; Wan, Man Pun",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.12350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25808677/,130

This descriptive analysis of a bereaved cohort recruited in the Charting the Territory (CTT) study describes patient characteristics, symptoms, use of medications, discussion of resuscitation orders and care provided preceding and during the end-of-life. METHODS Of the 275 children enrolled in the CTT study, 54 died between 2009 and 2014. Baseline demographic information, symptoms, interventions and medical information were collected via chart review, interviews and surveys. RESULTS 51 of the 54 children had complete medical records. Of the seven symptoms evaluated, children were found to have an increase in median symptoms from baseline (n=2) to time of death (n=3). Opioids were used in the last 48 hours of life in 29 (56.9%) children, whereas only eight (15.7%) were receiving opioids at baseline. Do Not Attempt Resuscitation orders were in place at baseline in 17 (33.3%) children, increasing to 33 (64.7%) at time of death. Death occurred in a hospice setting in 16 (31.4%) children. CONCLUSIONS While much emphasis on pediatric palliative care has been on supportive treatment and symptom management, when faced with a lack of sound understanding of a rare illness, the mode of care can often be reactive and based on critical needs. By developing greater knowledge of symptoms and illness trajectory, both management and care can be more responsive and anticipatory, thereby helping ease illness burden and suffering.","Bao, Danielle; Feichtinger, Leanne; Andrews, Gail; Pawliuk, Colleen; Steele, Rose; Siden, Harold Hal",Journal of pain and symptom management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.08.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916263/,130

The primary objective of this meta-analysis was to determine whether psychosocial interventions increase positive affect in cancer survivors. METHODS We coded 28 randomized controlled trials of psychosocial interventions assessing 2082 cancer survivors from six electronic databases. We calculated 76 effect sizes for positive affect and conducted synthesis using random effects models with robust variance estimation. Tests for moderation included demographic, clinical, and intervention characteristics. RESULTS Interventions had a modest effect on positive affect (g = 0.35, 95% CI [0.16, 0.54]) with substantial heterogeneity of effects across studies ([Formula: see text]; I2 = 78%). Three significant moderators were identified: in-person interventions outperformed remote interventions (P = .046), effects were larger when evaluated against standard of care or wait list control conditions versus attentional, educational, or component controls (P = .009), and trials with survivors of early-stage cancer diagnoses yielded larger effects than those with advanced-stage diagnoses (P = .046). We did not detect differential benefits of psychosocial interventions across samples varying in sex, age, on-treatment versus off-treatment status, or cancer type. Although no conclusive evidence suggested outcome reporting biases (P = .370), effects were smaller in studies with lower risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS In-person interventions with survivors of early-stage cancers hold promise for enhancing positive affect, but more methodological rigor is needed.

METHODS This is a retrospective single-center study of patients younger than 21 years presenting between March 1 and May 15, 2020. Included patients met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for MIS-C (inflammation, fever, involvement of 2 organ systems, lack of alternative diagnoses). We defined 3 subgroups by clinical outcomes: (1) critical illness requiring intensive care interventions; (2) patients meeting Kawasaki disease (KD) criteria but not requiring critical care; and (3) mild illness not meeting either criteria. A comparator cohort included patients with KD at our institution during the same time frame in 2019. RESULTS Thirty-three patients were included (5, critical; 8, 2020 KD; 20, mild). The median age for the critical group was 10.9 years (2.7 for 2020 KD; 6.0 for mild, P = 0.033). The critical group had lower median absolute lymphocyte count (850 vs 3005 vs 2940/uL, P = 0.005), platelets (150 vs 361 vs 252 k/uL, P = 0.005), and sodium (129 vs 136 vs 136 mmol/L, P = 0.002), and higher creatinine (0.7 vs 0.2 vs 0.3 mg/dL, P = 0.002).

76439,Reliability of Portable Spirometry Performed in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Compared to Conventional Spirometry.,2021-03-24,"With the outbreak of the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, many countries have imposed lockdowns which have caused an increase in Internet use. As large-scale disasters may have an impact on addictions, a review on Internet-based addictive behaviors seems necessary. The goals of this review are to find whether Internet-based addictive behaviors have increased during the pandemic and to define the main reasons for this increase. The systematic search was conducted in Google Scholar, Science Direct, PsycINFO, and PubMed in October of 2020, to determine the current evidence and observations concerning the Internet-based addictive behaviors amid COVID-19. Studies were included if they considered the Internet-based addictive behaviors during the current pandemic. We used all the names of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2 previously 2019 nCoV), the name of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and common Internet-based addictive behaviors, namely Internet addiction, online gaming disorder, online gambling disorder, pornography use, and smartphone use disorder. The study design is PEOs, finding if individuals' exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increase in Internet-based addictive behaviors. The quality of the studies was assessed independently by two authors using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The articles found in this review proved an increase in Internet-based addictive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic mostly due to financial hardships, isolation, problematic substance use, and mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and stress. Effective interventions should be scaled up to prevent and reduce online addictive behaviors, as well as accessible guidelines, particularly for adolescents.","Masaeli, Nassim; Farhadi, Hadi",Journal of addictive diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2021.1895962; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33749537/,130
78810,Concept Analysis and Proposed Definition of Community Health Center.,2021,"Exchange of gene segments through reassortment is a major feature of influenza A virus evolution and frequently contributes to the emergence of novel epidemic, pandemic, and zoonotic strains. It has long been evident that viral diversification through reassortment is constrained by genetic incompatibility between divergent parental viruses. In contrast, the role of virus-extrinsic factors in determining the likelihood of reassortment has remained unclear. To evaluate the impact of such factors in the absence of confounding effects of segment mismatch, we previously reported an approach in which reassortment between wild-type (wt) and genetically tagged variant (var) viruses of the same strain is measured. Here, using wt/var systems in the A/Netherlands/602/2009 (pH1N1) and A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) strain backgrounds, we tested whether inoculation of parental viruses into distinct sites within the respiratory tract limits their reassortment. Using a ferret (Mustella putorius furo) model, either matched parental viruses were coinoculated intranasally or one virus was instilled intranasally whereas the second was instilled intratracheally. Dual intranasal inoculation resulted in robust reassortment for wt/var viruses of both strain backgrounds. In contrast, when infections were initiated simultaneously at distinct sites, strong compartmentalization of viral replication was observed and minimal reassortment was detected. The observed lack of viral spread between upper and lower respiratory tract tissues may be attributable to localized exclusion of superinfection within the host, mediated by innate immune responses. Our findings indicate that dual infections in nature are more likely to result in reassortment if viruses are seeded into similar anatomical locations and have matched tissue tropisms.IMPORTANCE Genetic exchange between influenza A viruses (IAVs) through reassortment can facilitate the emergence of antigenically drifted seasonal strains and plays a prominent role in the development of pandemics. Typical human influenza infections are concentrated in the upper respiratory tract; however, lower respiratory tract (LRT) infection is an important feature of severe cases, which are more common in the very young, the elderly, and individuals with underlying conditions. In addition to host factors, viral characteristics and mode of transmission can also increase the likelihood of LRT infection: certain zoonotic IAVs are thought to favor the LRT, and transmission via small droplets allows direct seeding into lower respiratory tract tissues. To gauge the likelihood of reassortment in coinfected hosts, we assessed the extent to which initiation of infection at distinct respiratory tract sites impacts reassortment frequency. Our results reveal that spatially distinct inoculations result in anatomical compartmentalization of infection, which in turn strongly limits reassortment.","Richard, Mathilde; Herfst, Sander; Tao, Hui; Jacobs, Nathan T; Lowen, Anice C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02063-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29212934/,130

MATERIALS AND METHODS Only patients aged between 3 and 16 years, who had started treatment before the lockdown and had spent this periodwith both parents were included in the study. The interviews were carried out using an anonymous questionnaire that assessed school and play activities, the type of diet, the time dedicated to home oral hygiene and the activities carried out with parents. Parents' work situation during lockdown was included to correlate it with time spent at home. The Frankl Behavior Rating Scale was used to determine the degree of cooperation during dental sessions pre- and post-lockdown. Chi-square test and Fisher's Exact tests were used to identify statistical associations of improvement with each categorical variable. Student's t-test was used to highlight the differences in mean values of continuous variables between subjects considered more cooperative and unimproved subjects. Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the model. Assumption of linearity of independent variables and log-odds were assessed by Box-Tidwell transformation. Final selection was carried out using the Akaike criterion and all statistical analyses were carried out using the STATA statistical software package. RESULTS The sample consisted of 212 patients (103F; 109M). The age ranged between 3 and 16 years with an average age of 9.03 years; 82.08% (95% CI 76.24-86.99) of the subjects showed an improvement in collaboration compared to pre-lockdown. Logistic analysis reveals a statistically significant increase of the odds of improvement in patients with a lower pre-lockdown collaboration (OR: 6.05, p = 0.001), in children with a parental presence at home (jobless, OR : 30.55, p <0.001; in ""smart working"", OR: 23.06, p <0.001) when compared to children whose parents work away from home. From a further exploratory analysis, time dedicated to home oral hygiene was increased if associated with an increased presence of the parents at home (p = 0.015). CONCLUSION Changes in family routines and increased parental presence at home, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, are associated with improved collaboration of children during dental sessions. A statistical association between the increase in time spent on oral hygiene and the increased presence of parents at home was found.","Brescia, A V; Bensi, C; Di Gennaro, G; Monda, M; Docimo, R",European journal of paediatric dentistry,https://doi.org/10.23804/ejpd.2021.22.01.11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719485/,130

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES We hypothesized that dogs with OSA could be treated safely by ex vivo activated T-cells that were generated by autologous cancer vaccination and supported by interleukin-2 (IL-2) treatment with survival more than twice that reported for amputation alone. ANIMALS Osteosarcoma-bearing dogs (n = 14) were enrolled in a single-arm prospective trial after complete staging before amputation. Four healthy dogs also were treated in a safety study. METHODS Autologous cancer cell vaccinations were administered intradermally and dogs underwent leukapheresis. Mononuclear cell products were stimulated ex vivo with a T-cell-activating agent. Activated product was transfused and 5 SC IL-2 injections were administered q48h. Dogs were monitored for metastasis by thoracic radiography every 3 months. RESULTS Autologous cancer cell vaccine and activated cellular therapy (ACT) products were successfully generated. Toxicity was minimal after premedicants were instituted before ACT. With premedication, all toxicities were grade I/II. Median disease-free interval for all dogs was 213 days. One dog developed cutaneous metastasis but then experienced spontaneous complete remission. Median survival time for all dogs was 415 days. Five dogs survived >730 days. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE This immunotherapy protocol without cytotoxic chemotherapy is safe and tolerable. Compared to historical amputation reports, survival was notably prolonged in this group of patients.

In this retrospective observational case-control study were included patients undergoing unilateral (group 1) and one-stage bilateral (group 2) THA in a high-volume center. The groups were matched for gender, age at surgery, and pre-operative American Society of Anesthesiology score. The following variables were assessed: local and systemic complications, postoperative anemia, 30-day and 1-year readmission and reoperation rates, length of hospital stay, and ambulation time. Group 1 reported a significantly higher rate of local and systemic complications compared with group 2 (5.4% versus 3.9% and 29.6% versus 4.7%, respectively). Postoperative anemia was significantly lower in group 1 compared with group 2 (8.1% versus 30%). There was no significant difference in terms of 30-day and 1-year readmission rates between the two groups. The average length of hospital stay was 5.1 ± 2.3 days in group 1, and 5.3 ± 1.9 days in group 2 (p = 0.78).

Methods: REACH expanded its telemedicine capabilities by transitioning its in-person clinic and methods of connecting with referrals to telemedicine. The program provided patients with phones to increase access to needed technology. Results: Throughout 2020, patient visits continuously shifted from being entirely in-person, to entirely telemedicine, to a hybrid model. Clinic show rates averaged 71% with this hybrid model, compared with 57% pre-COVID-19. Phones were distributed to 88 patients, 77% of which engaged in at least one telemedicine visit.

82743,Young people's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-06-24,"BACKGROUND Network-based analysis of gene expression through co-expression networks can be used to investigate modular relationships occurring between genes performing different biological functions. An extended description of each of the network modules is therefore a critical step to understand the underlying processes contributing to a disease or a phenotype. Biological integration, topology study and conditions comparison (e.g. wild vs mutant) are the main methods to do so, but to date no tool combines them all into a single pipeline. RESULTS Here we present GWENA, a new R package that integrates gene co-expression network construction and whole characterization of the detected modules through gene set enrichment, phenotypic association, hub genes detection, topological metric computation, and differential co-expression. To demonstrate its performance, we applied GWENA on two skeletal muscle datasets from young and old patients of GTEx study. Remarkably, we prioritized a gene whose involvement was unknown in the muscle development and growth. Moreover, new insights on the variations in patterns of co-expression were identified. The known phenomena of connectivity loss associated with aging was found coupled to a global reorganization of the relationships leading to expression of known aging related functions. CONCLUSION GWENA is an R package available through Bioconductor ( https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GWENA.html ) that has been developed to perform extended analysis of gene co-expression networks. Thanks to biological and topological information as well as differential co-expression, the package helps to dissect the role of genes relationships in diseases conditions or targeted phenotypes. GWENA goes beyond existing packages that perform co-expression analysis by including new tools to fully characterize modules, such as differential co-expression, additional enrichment databases, and network visualization.","Lemoine, Gwenaëlle G; Scott-Boyer, Marie-Pier; Ambroise, Bathilde; Périn, Olivier; Droit, Arnaud",BMC bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-021-04179-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34034647/,130

METHODS A total of 14 experimental miniature pigs were randomly divided into four groups (55°& 5-watt, 55°& 8-watt, 65°& 5-watt, and 65° & 8-watt groups). Spark was used for left and right renal artery radiofrequency ablation. Blood samples collected from renal arteries and veins as well as renal arteriography were performed on all animals before, immediately after, and three months after procedure to evaluate the effects of Spark on the levels of plasma renin, aldosterone, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II as well as the pathological changes of renal arteries. RESULTS One pig died of an anesthetic accident, 13 pigs successfully underwent the bilateral renal artery ablation. Compared with basic measurements, pigs in all the four groups had significantly decreased mean arterial pressure after procedure. Histopathological analysis showed that this procedure could result in intimal hyperplasia, significant peripheral sympathetic nerve damage in the renal arteries such as inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis in perineurium, uneven distribution of nerve fibers, tissue necrosis, severe vacuolization, fragmented and unclear nucleoli myelin degeneration, sparse axons, and interruption of continuity. In addition, the renal artery radiofrequency ablation could significantly reduce the levels of plasma renin, aldosterone, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II in pigs. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that this type of multi-electrode catheter-based radiofrequency ablation could effectively remove peripheral renal sympathetic nerves and reduce the activity of systemic renin-angiotensin system in pigs, thus facilitating the control of systemic blood pressure in pigs.","Gan, Qian; Qu, Xin-Kai; Gong, Kai-Zheng; Guan, Shao-Feng; Han, Wen-Zheng; Dai, Jin-Jie; Li, Ruo-Gu; Zhang, Min; Liu, Hua; Xu, Ying-Jia; Zhang, You-Jun; Fang, Wei-Yi",Journal of geriatric cardiology : JGC,https://doi.org/10.11909/j.issn.1671-5411.2015.06.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26788038/,130

How animals use their environment can be mediated by their personality (e.g. risk-taking), but does personality mediate how overwintering species select refugia? Snow cover is a dynamic winter characteristic that can influence crypsis or provide below-the-snow refugia. We explored how wintering ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) selected snow roosting sites, a behaviour that reduces stress and cold exposure. We linked selection for approximately 700 roosts with survival of 42 grouse, and showed that grouse generally selected deeper snow and warmer areas. Grouse found in shallow snow were less likely to survive winter. However, individuals that selected deep snow improved their survival, suggesting that demographic consequences of selecting winter refugia are mediated by differences in personality.

Although there is a large literature examining the relationship between a wide range of political economy exposures and health outcomes, the extent to which the different aspects of political economy influence health, and through which mechanisms and in what contexts, is only partially understood. The areas in which there are few high-quality studies are also unclear. Objectives. To systematically review the literature describing the impact of political economy on population health. Search Methods. We undertook a systematic review of reviews, searching MEDLINE, Embase, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, ProQuest Public Health, Sociological Abstracts, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, EconLit, SocINDEX, Web of Science, and the gray literature via Google Scholar. Selection Criteria. We included studies that were a review of the literature. Relevant exposures were differences or changes in policy, law, or rules; economic conditions; institutions or social structures; or politics, power, or conflict. Relevant outcomes were any overall measure of population health such as self-assessed health, mortality, life expectancy, survival, morbidity, well-being, illness, ill health, and life span. Two authors independently reviewed all citations for relevance. Data Collection and Analysis. We undertook critical appraisal of all included reviews by using modified Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) criteria and then synthesized narratively giving greater weight to the higher-quality reviews. Main Results. From 4912 citations, we included 58 reviews. Both the quality of the reviews and the underlying studies within the reviews were variable. Social democratic welfare states, higher public spending, fair trade policies, extensions to compulsory education provision, microfinance initiatives in low-income countries, health and safety policy, improved access to health care, and high-quality affordable housing have positive impacts on population health. Neoliberal restructuring seems to be associated with increased health inequalities and higher income inequality with lower self-rated health and higher mortality. Authors' Conclusions. Politics, economics, and public policy are important determinants of population health. Countries with social democratic regimes, higher public spending, and lower income inequalities have populations with better health. There are substantial gaps in the synthesized evidence on the relationship between political economy and health, and there is a need for higher-quality reviews and empirical studies in this area. However, there is sufficient evidence in this review, if applied through policy and practice, to have marked beneficial health impacts. Public Health Implications. Policymakers should be aware that social democratic welfare state types, countries that spend more on public services, and countries with lower income inequalities have better self-rated health and lower mortality. Research funders and researchers should be aware that there remain substantial gaps in the available evidence base. One such area concerns the interrelationship between governance, polities, power, macroeconomic policy, public policy, and population health, including how these aspects of political economy generate social class processes and forms of discrimination that have a differential impact across social groups. This includes the influence of patterns of ownership (of land and capital) and tax policies. For some areas, there are many lower-quality reviews, which leave uncertainties in the relationship between political economy and population health, and a high-quality review is needed. There are also areas in which the available reviews have identified primary research gaps such as the impact of changes to housing policy, availability, and tenure.","McCartney, Gerry; Hearty, Wendy; Arnot, Julie; Popham, Frank; Cumbers, Andrew; McMaster, Robert",American journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.2105/ajph.2019.305001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31067117/,130

Vitamin D has anti-infective and immunomodulatory effects that may decrease the risk for respiratory infections, asthma, and acute chest syndrome. We conducted a randomized double-blind active-controlled clinical trial to determine whether monthly oral vitamin D3 can reduce the rate of respiratory events in children with sickle cell disease. Seventy sickle cell subjects, ages 3-20 years, with baseline records of respiratory events over 1 year before randomization, underwent screening. Sixty-two subjects with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of 5-60 ng/mL were randomly assigned to oral vitamin D3 (100 000 IU or 12 000 IU, n = 31 each) under observed administration once monthly for 2 years. The primary outcome was the annual rate of respiratory events (respiratory infection, asthma exacerbation, or acute chest syndrome) ascertained by the use of a validated questionnaire administered biweekly. Analysis included 62 children (mean age of 9.9 years, 52% female, and predominantly with homozygous HbS disease [87%]) with mean baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 14.3 ng/mL.

DESIGN Longitudinal study of children for vURTIs, CLIs, and concentrations and ratios of nasal cytokines. SETTING Outpatient assessments of children. PARTICIPANTS A total of 224 children, aged 1 to 9 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Concentrations of IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 in nasal secretions, vURTIs diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of upper respiratory tract viruses, and concurrent CLIs diagnosed by parents. RESULTS Of 1269 secretion samples, 552 (43.5%) were collected during a vURTI (PCR findings positive for an assayed virus [PCR(+)]). A concurrent CLI was diagnosed for 34% of the PCR(+) samples and for 18% of the samples found to be negative by PCR analysis (PCR(-)). Cytokine concentrations and ratios were highly variable and skewed to the lower values. The significance of the cytokine concentrations and ratios as discriminators of groups defined by the presence or absence of virus and of subgroups defined by the presence or absence of a CLI was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves. All measures were significant discriminators of the PCR(+) vs PCR(-) groups, and most were significant discriminators of the paired CLI subgroups. The concentration of IL-6 and the IL-5/IL-6 ratio were the best discriminators across all groups and subgroups. However, the sensitivities and specificities of those discriminators at the best cutoff values were on the order of 0.7 for the most extreme pairwise comparison (PCR(+)CLI(+) vs PCR(-)CLI(-)) and lower for the other comparison groups.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Fifty-one consecutive patients with organ-confined prostate cancer underwent RARP by one of two experienced surgeons. UVA was performed in two layers, using a unidirectional barbed suture fashioned into a double-ended stitch. Perioperative outcomes and 30-day complications were recorded. RESULTS All anastomoses were performed without assistance and without tying a knot. Median time for entire dual-layer anastomosis was 14.0 minutes (interquartile range [IQR]: 12-20) and that for urethrovesical anastomosis was 11 minutes (IQR: 9-15). Not having to rely on an assistant to follow the suture decreased instrument clashes, entangling of the suture around an instrument, and made the anastomosis faster. Eight patients underwent anterior/lateral reconstruction of the bladder neck, and there were no leaks on cystography at 1 week. CONCLUSIONS We describe the first reported clinical experience with a novel technique of performing UVA during RARP that is safe and efficient. Using the barbed wound closure device prevents slippage, precluding the need for assistance, knot tying, and constant reassessing of anastomosis integrity.","Kaul, Sanjeev; Sammon, Jesse; Bhandari, Akshay; Peabody, James; Rogers, Craig G; Menon, Mani",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2010.0200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20626271/,130
86641,Tradeoff between efficiency and perceived quality: evidence from patient-level data.,2020-11-16,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to compare the surgical outcomes and cost of robotic single-site radical hysterectomy (RSSRH) versus robotic multiport radical hysterectomy (RMPRH) with pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) in early stage cervical cancer. METHODS Sixty-two patients with early stage cervical cancer were recruited between November 2011 and July 2017 and underwent RSSRH (20 patients) and RMPRH (42 patients) for early stage cervical cancer using the da Vinci Si Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA). RESULTS There were no significant difference between the two groups in most of parameters. However, postoperative hospital discharge and total hospital costs for RSSRH were significantly shorter than RMPRH (both p<0.001). However, lymph node retrieval of RMPRH was significantly higher than RSSRH in (18.0 vs. 9.5, respectively; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS RSSRH has comparable surgical outcomes to the RMPRH method. RSSRH could be considered a surgical option in a well-selected patient group. This article is protected by copyright.

87541,Copper intrauterine device use and HIV acquisition in women: a systematic review.,2020-01-01,"BACKGROUND The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adult lung transplants, and report practice changes in the US. METHODS A retrospective analysis of a public dataset from the United Network for Organ Sharing was performed regarding adult lung transplantation (1/19/2020-6/30/2020). Data were stratified into 3 periods: pre-COVID-19 (1/19/2020 - 3/14/2020), 1-COVID-19 era (3/15/2020 - 5/8/2020), and 2-COVID-19 era (5/9/2020 - 6/30/2020). Weekly changes in waitlist inactivations (COVID-19 precautions or not), waitlist additions, transplant volume, and donor recovery were examined across eras and changes across era were correlated. RESULTS During 1-COVID-19 era, 301 patients were added to the waitlist, representing a 40% decrease when compared to the prior 8-week period. This was followed by a significant increase in listing during the 2-COVID-19 era (t = 2.16, P = .032). Waitlist inactivations decreased in 2-COVID-19 era from the 1-COVID-19 era (t = 3.60, P < .001). There was no difference in waitlist inactivations between the pre-COVID era and the 2-COVID-19 era (P = .10). Weekly volume was not associated with trends in COVID-19 cases across any era but was negatively associated with waitlist inactivations due to COVID-19 precautions entering the 1-COVID-19 era (r = -0.73, P = .04) and 2-COVID-19 eras (r = -0.89, P = .003). CONCLUSION Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the US experienced a decrease in lung transplant volume. While overall volume has returned to normal, additional studies are needed to identify areas of improvement to better prepare for future pandemics.","Chan, Ernest G; Chan, Patrick G; Harano, Takashi; Ryan, John P; Morrell, Matthew R; Sanchez, Pablo G",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141810/,130
88590,Disruption to homeostasis.,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS There are several short-term prognostic scores for alcoholic hepatitis (AH) that combine demographical and biochemical parameters. The extent of liver fibrosis may also be relevant to the prognosis of AH with potential added value. We evaluated collagen proportionate area (CPA) as a predictor of short and long-term mortality in AH. METHODS We retrospectively included patients with biopsy-verified AH. Clinical, laboratory and outcome data were collected. CPA and five AH scores were calculated: Maddrey's DF, MELD, GAHS, ABIC, and the Lille Model. Predictors of short and long-term all-cause mortality were assessed using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS We included 140 patients with AH. In total, 67 (48%) patients died after a median follow-up of 66 (IQR 102) months, with 17 (12%) dying within the first 90-days. CPA was not a predictor of 90-days mortality and had no additional value to the prognostic AH scores on short-term mortality. However, CPA predicted long-term mortality independently of prognostic AH scores. Importantly, CPA and abstinence from alcohol were independent predictors of long-term mortality in patients alive 90 days after the biopsy. CONCLUSION CPA predicts long-term mortality in patients with AH independently of abstinence from alcohol but has no prognostic value on short-term mortality.","Israelsen, Mads; Misas, Marta Guerrero; Koutsoumourakis, Anastasios; Hall, Andrew; Covelli, Claudia; Buzzetti, Elena; Prat, Laura Iogna; Roccarina, Davide; Luong, Tu Vinh; Quaglia, Alberto; Pinzani, Massimo; Tsochatzis, Emmanuel A",Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2021.08.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548258/,130
89030,Mental Health of Psychiatrists and Physicians of Other Specialties in Early COVID-19 Pandemic: Risk ind Protective Factors.,2020,"Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is an important but poorly understood complication of snakebite associated with acute kidney injury (AKI). Numerous treatments have been attempted based on limited evidence. We conducted a systematic review of TMA following snakebite using a pre-determined case definition of blood film red cell schistocytes or histologically diagnosed TMA. The search strategy included major electronic databases and grey literature. We present a descriptive synthesis for the outcomes of AKI, dialysis free survival (DFS), other end-organ damage, overall survival, and interventions with antivenom and therapeutic plasmapheresis (TPE). This study was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019121436). Seventy-two studies reporting 351 cases were included, predominantly small observational studies. Heterogeneity for study selection, design, reporting and outcomes were observed. The commonest envenoming species were hump-nosed vipers (Hypnale spp.), Russell's viper (Daboia russelii) and Australian brown snakes (Pseudechis spp.). The prevalence of TMA was at least 5.4% in proven and probable Hypnale bites, and 10-15% of Australian elapid envenomings, AKI occurred in 94% (293/312) of TMA cases, excluding case reports. The majority of cases with AKI required dialysis. Included prospective and retrospective cohort studies reporting interventions and renal outcomes showed no evidence for benefit from antivenom or TPE with respect to DFS in dialysis dependant AKI. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) assessment for quality of accumulated evidence for interventions was low. The major complication of TMA following snakebite is AKI. AKI improves in most cases. We found no evidence to support benefit from antivenom in snakebite associated TMA, but antivenom remains the standard of care for snake envenoming. There was no evidence for benefit of TPE in snakebite associated TMA, so TPE cannot be recommended. The quality of accumulated evidence was low, highlighting a need for high quality larger studies.","Noutsos, Tina; Currie, Bart J; Lek, Rachel A; Isbister, Geoffrey K",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33290400/,130
89231,From the Editor: At the heart of the mission of general practice.,2020-03-01,"BACKGROUND Higher intra-abdominal pressure may impair cardiopulmonary functions during laparoscopic surgery. While 12-15 mmHg is generally recommended as a standard pressure, the benefits of lower intra-abdominal pressure are unclear. We thus studied whether the low intra-abdominal pressure compared with the standard pressure improves cardiopulmonary dynamics during laparoscopic surgery. METHODS Patients were randomized according to the intra-abdominal pressure and neuromuscular blocking levels during laparoscopic colorectal surgery: low pressure (8 mmHg) with deep-block (post-tetanic count 1-2), standard pressure (12 mmHg) with deep-block, and standard pressure with moderate-block (train-of-four count 1-2) groups. During the laparoscopic procedure, we recorded cardiopulmonary variables including cardiac index, pulmonary compliance, and surgical conditions. We also assessed postoperative pain intensity and recovery time of bowel movement. The primary outcome was the cardiac index 30 min after onset of laparoscopy. RESULTS Patients were included in the low pressure with deep-block (n = 44), standard pressure with deep-block (n = 44), and standard pressure with moderate-block (n = 43) groups. The mean (SD) of cardiac index 30 min after laparoscopy was 2.7 (0.7), 2.7 (0.9), and 2.6 (1.0) L min-1 m-2 in each group (P = 0.715). The pulmonary compliance was higher but the surgical condition was poorer in the low intra-abdominal pressure than the standard pressure (both P < 0.001). Other variables were comparable between groups. CONCLUSION We observed few cardiopulmonary benefits but poor surgical conditions in the low intra-abdominal pressure during laparoscopy. Considering cardiopulmonary dynamics and surgical conditions, the standard intra-abdominal pressure may be preferable to the low pressure for laparoscopic surgery.","Cho, Youn Joung; Paik, Hyesun; Jeong, Seung-Yong; Park, Ji Won; Jo, Woo Young; Jeon, Yunseok; Lee, Kook Hyun; Seo, Jeong-Hwa",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6204-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29761274/,130

90054,Spontaneous bilateral torsion of fallopian tubes presenting as primary infertility.,2016,"OBJECTIVES Direct cost for methods of prediction also named risk assessment in dentistry may be negligible compared with the cost of extensive constructions. On the other hand, as risk assessment is performed daily and for several patients in general dental practice, the costs may be considerable. The objective was to summarize evidence in studies of economic evaluation of prognostic prediction multivariable models and methods of caries and periodontitis and to identify knowledge gaps (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020149763). MATERIAL AND METHODS Four electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, NHS Economic Evaluation Database) and reference lists of included studies were searched. Titles and abstracts were screened by two reviewers in parallel. Full-text studies reporting resources used, costs and cost-effectiveness of prediction models and methods were selected and critically appraised using a protocol based on items from the CHEERS checklist for economic evaluations and the CHARMS checklist for evaluation of prediction studies. RESULTS From 38 selected studies, six studies on prediction fulfilled the eligibility criteria, four on caries and two on periodontitis. As the economic evaluations differed in method and perspective among the studies, the results could not be generalized. Our systematic review revealed methodological shortcomings regarding the description of predictive models and methods, and particularly of the economic evaluation. CONCLUSIONS The systematic review highlighted a paucity of economic evaluations regarding methods or multivariable models for prediction of caries and periodontitis. Our results indicate that what we currently practice using models and methods to predict caries and periodontitis lacks evidence regarding cost-effectiveness.","Fransson, Helena; Davidson, Thomas; Rohlin, Madeleine; Christell, Helena",Clinical and experimental dental research,https://doi.org/10.1002/cre2.405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594834/,130
90292,International Sexual Health And REproductive health (I-SHARE) survey during COVID-19: study protocol for online national surveys and global comparative analyses.,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND Spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) are used to assess the readiness for discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. When airway resistance (Raw) is elevated, the imposed work of breathing can lead to prolongation of mechanical ventilation. Biofilm and mucus build-up within the endotracheal tube (ETT) can increase Raw. Scraping the ETT can remove the biofilm build-up and decrease mechanical Raw. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of ETT scraping on Raw. The secondary aim was to determine whether decreasing Raw would impact subsequent SBT success. METHODS Intubated, mechanically ventilated subjects were enrolled if they failed an SBT and had an Raw of > 10 cm H2O/L/s. SBT failure was based on institutional guidelines, and Raw was calculated by subtracting the difference between the measured peak and plateau pressures using a square flow waveform with an inspiratory flow set at 60 L/min. The endOclear device was inserted into the ETT and withdrawn per manufacturer's guidelines. Scraping was repeated until the ETT was cleared. Change in Raw was compared pre- and post-ETT scraping using a paired t test. A Mann-Whitney U test evaluated the difference in percentage change in Raw between SBT groups. RESULTS Twenty-nine subjects completed the study. The mean pre- and post-ETT scraping Raw values were 15.17 ± 3.83 and 12.05 ± 3.19 cm H2O/L/s, respectively (P < .001). Subsequent SBT success was 48%; however, there was no difference in percentage change in Raw between subsequent passed SBT (18.61% [interquartile range 8.90-33.93%]) and failed SBT (23.88% [interquartile range 0.00-34.80%]), U = 78.5, z = -0.284, P = .78. No adverse events were noted with ETT scraping. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that ETT scraping can reduce Raw. The decrease in Raw post-ETT scraping did not affect subsequent SBT success.","Scott, J Brady; Dubosky, Meagan N; Vines, David L; Sulaiman, Adewunmi S; Jendral, Kyle R; Singh, Gagan; Patel, Ankeet; Kaplan, Carl A; Gurka, David P; Balk, Robert A",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.05391; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28790149/,130

This was a quasi-experimental study where the effects of a training program, (based on correctional and therapeutic exercises, on primary dysmenorrhoea and menstrual bleeding in women with hyper-lordosis) was determined. The severity of menstrual pain was evaluated by use of a questionnaire. There was a significant incidence of neurological pain, which was not reduced in the control group (who had no exercise). There was a significant relationship between the severity of menstrual pain and hyper-lordosis. In the intervention group, there was a significant decrease in the severity of menstrual pain following 12 weeks of exercise. Hyper-lordosis can be improved by performing corrective exercises and strengthening the abdominal muscles. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Exercise is positively associated with changes in the menstrual cycle and has beneficial effects on menstruation. What do the results of this study add? This research determines the relationship between lumbar lordosis and severe menstrual pain and the association of severe menstrual bleeding, in order to take effective corrective actions to improve women's health.

Whether these fluid collections show bacterial contamination over time in primary total knee arthroplasty remains unclear. Methods In this study, we included 100 patients. We collected the samples of irrigation fluid before skin incision and every 30 minutes after the start of surgery. In addition, at the end of surgery, we evaluated the suction tip for bacterial contamination. After 3 months, we clinically evaluated all patients for periprosthetic joint infection. Results Although the drapes were found to be sterile after 30 minutes, fluid residues on the surgical drapes show a contamination rate of 22% after 60 minutes and thus a marked correlation between advanced duration of surgery and bacterial contamination. The suction tip was contaminated with bacteria in 22% of cases. The spectrum of pathogens typical of periprosthetic joint infection could be demonstrated. Conclusion Fluid surgical drape reservoirs were abacterial during the first 30 minutes but showed marked bacterial contamination over time. For total knee arthroplasty, we recommend regular replacement of the suction tip every 30 minutes. In addition, irrigation fluid reservoirs should not be withdrawn by suction 30 minutes after skin incision.","Fuchs, Michael; von Roth, Philipp; Pfitzner, Tilman; Kopf, Sebastian; Sass, Frauke Andrea; Hommel, Hagen",Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.

96275,Confronting Challenges in the US Health Care System: Potential Opportunity in a Time of Crisis.,2021-04-13,"BACKGROUND Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) pathophysiology is a complex, multistage process, usually diagnosed at advanced stages after significant anatomical and hemodynamic changes in the valve. Early detection of disease progression is thus pivotal in the development of prevention and mitigation strategies. In this study, we developed a diet-based, non-genetically modified mouse model for early CAVD progression, and explored the utility of two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) microscopy for early detection of CAVD progression. TPEF imaging provides label-free, non-invasive, quantitative metrics with the potential to correlate with multiple stages of CAVD pathophysiology including calcium deposition, collagen remodeling and osteogenic differentiation. METHODS Twenty-week old C57BL/6J mice were fed either a control or pro-calcific diet for 16 weeks and monitored via echocardiography, histology, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polarized light imaging. Additionally, TPEF imaging was used to quantify tissue autofluorescence (A) at 755 nm, 810 nm and 860 nm excitation, to calculate TPEF 755-860 ratio (A860/525/(A755/460 + A860/525)) and TPEF Collagen-Calcium ratio (A810/525/(A810/460 + A810/525)) in the murine valves. In a separate experiment, animals were fed the above diets till 28 weeks to assess for later-stage calcification. RESULTS Pro-calcific mice showed evidence of lipid deposition at 4 weeks and calcification at 16 weeks at the valve commissures. The valves of pro-calcific mice also showed positive expression for markers of osteogenic differentiation, myofibroblast activation, proliferation, inflammatory cytokines and collagen remodeling. Pro-calcific mice exhibited lower TPEF autofluorescence ratios, at locations coincident with calcification, that correlated with increased collagen disorganization and positive expression of osteogenic markers. Additionally, locations with lower TPEF autofluorescence ratios at 4 and 16 weeks exhibited increased calcification at later 28-week timepoints. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests the potential of TPEF autofluorescence metrics to serve as a label-free tool for early detection and monitoring of CAVD pathophysiology.","Tandon, Ishita; Johns, Shelby; Woessner, Alan; Perez, Jessica; Cross, Delaney; Ozkizilcik, Asya; Muldoon, Timothy J; Vallurupalli, Srikanth; Padala, Muralidhar; Quinn, Kyle P; Balachandran, Kartik",BMC cardiovascular disorders,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-020-01776-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33308143/,130

This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between anxiety induced by COVID-19 and perceived social support in Iranian pregnant women. METHODS This online cross-sectional study was conducted on 801 pregnant women from all over Iran in 2020. The data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, the multidimensional scale of perceived social support, and the coronavirus disease anxiety scale. A standard multiple linear regression model was used to identify the association between perceived social support and anxiety, controlling for possible confounding variables. Partial r was used as an estimate of effect size. RESULTS The mean anxiety score was 10.7 ± 8.0, in which its level was moderate in 122 (15.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 12.8-17.9%)) of the participants, and severe in 28 (3.4%; 95% CI: 2.3-5.0%) of them. The mean score of perceived social support was 48.2 ± 7.6. 6.9% (95% CI: 5.2-8.8%) and 93.1% (95% CI: 91.2-94.8%) of the participants reported mild and moderate levels of perceived social support, respectively. The results of the multiple linear model showed a significant negative correlation between perceived social support and anxiety levels in a way that for every 10 units increase in the perceived social support score, the anxiety level of pregnant women was decreased by 0.8 units (B= -0.08, t= -2.08, p = 0.037), which was a small effect size (partial r = -0.07). CONCLUSION There was a small significant relationship between the perceived social support and COVID-19 anxiety. Further studies are required to identify associated factors of anxiety level during COVID-19 in pregnant women.","Behmard, Vahideh; Bahri, Narjes; Mohammadzadeh, Fatemeh; Noghabi, Ali Delshad; Bahri, Nasrin",Journal of psychosomatic obstetrics and gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1080/0167482x.2021.1918671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33944674/,130

97097,What makes life worth living.,2020-09-01,"INTRODUCTION The aim of this study was to report the course and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients treated with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in Poland. A major concern for neurologists worldwide is the course and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with MS treated with different DMTs. Although initial studies do not suggest an unfavourable course of infection in this group of patients, the data is limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study included 396 MS patients treated with DMTs and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 28 Polish MS centres. Information concerning patient demographics, comorbidities, clinical course of MS, current DMT use, as well as symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, need for pharmacotherapy, oxygen therapy, and/or hospitalisation, and short-term outcomes was collected up to 30 January 2021. Additional data about COVID-19 cases in the general population in Poland was obtained from official reports of the Polish Ministry of Health. RESULTS There were 114 males (28.8%) and 282 females (71.2%). The median age was 39 years (IQR 13). The great majority of patients with MS exhibited relapsing-remitting course (372 patients; 93.9%). The median EDSS was 2 (SD 1.38), and the mean disease duration was 8.95 (IQR 8) years. Most of the MS patients were treated with dimethyl fumarate (164; 41.41%). Other DMTs were less frequently used: interferon beta (82; 20.70%), glatiramer acetate (42; 10.60%), natalizumab (35;8.84%), teriflunomide (25; 6.31%), ocrelizumab (20; 5.05%), fingolimod (16; 4.04), cladribine (5; 1.26%), mitoxantrone (3; 0.76%), ozanimod (3; 0.76%), and alemtuzumab (1; 0.25%). The overall hospitalisation rate due to COVID-19 in the cohort was 6.81% (27 patients). Only one patient (0.3%) died due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and three (0.76%) patients were treated with mechanical ventilation; 106 (26.8%) patients had at least one comorbid condition. There were no significant differences in the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection regarding patient age, duration of the disease, degree of disability (EDSS), lymphocyte count, or type of DMT used. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Most MS patients included in this study had a favourable course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The hospitalisation rate and the mortality rate were not higher in the MS cohort compared to the general Polish population. Continued multicentre data collection is needed to increase the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection impact on the course of MS in patients treated with DMTs.","Czarnowska, Agata; Brola, Waldemar; Zajkowska, Olga; Rusek, Stanisław; Adamczyk-Sowa, Monika; Kubicka-Bączyk, Katarzyna; Kalinowska-Łyszczarz, Alicja; Kania, Karolina; Słowik, Agnieszka; Wnuk, Marcin; Marona, Monika; Podlecka-Piętowska, Aleksandra; Nojszewska, Monika; Zakrzewska-Pniewska, Beata; Jasińska, Elżbieta; Gołuch, Katarzyna; Lech, Beata; Noga, Magdalena; Perenc, Adam; Popiel, Małgorzata; Lasek-Bal, Anetta; Puz, Przemysław; Maciejowska, Katarzyna; Kucharska-Lipowska, Marta; Lipowski, Michał; Kapica-Topczewska, Katarzyna; Chorąży, Monika; Tarasiuk, Joanna; Kochanowicz, Jan; Kulikowska, Joanna; Wawrzyniak, Sławomir; Niezgodzińska-Maciejek, Anna; Pokryszko-Dragan, Anna; Gruszka, Ewa; Budrewicz, Sławomir; Białek, Marta; Kurkowska-Jastrzębska, Iwona; Kurowska, Katarzyna; Stępień, Adam; Włodek, Agata; Ptasznik, Violetta; Pawełczyk, Małgorzata; Sobolewski, Piotr; Lejmel, Henryka; Strzalińska, Katarzyna; Maciejowski, Maciej; Tutaj, Andrzej; Zwiernik, Jacek; Litwin, Anna; Lewańczyk, Bożena; Paprocka, Izabela; Zwiernik, Beata; Pawlos, Aleksandra; Borysowicz, Andrzej; Narożnik, Anna; Michałowska, Anna; Nosek, Krzysztof; Fudala, Małgorzata; Milewska-Jędrzejczak, Marta; Kułakowska, Alina; Bartosik-Psujek, Halina",Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska,https://doi.org/10.5603/pjnns.a2021.0031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33856686/,130

The ACE-CoV study was designed to assess this question. The study was conducted in the Covid-Clinic-Toul cohort, which contains data about all patients hospitalized at Toulouse University hospital, France with a SARS-CoV-2 infection since March, 2020. We selected the patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (heart failure or coronary disease) and/or arterial hypertension. We conducted a subgroup analysis in patients with arterial hypertension. ACEI/ARB exposures at admission were assessed. The outcome was composite: admission to intensive care unit, need of mechanical ventilation or death during the 14 days after admission to hospital. We used logistic regression models with propensity scores (PS) weighted by overlap weighting (OW) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Between March 2020 and April 20, 2020, the Covid-Clinic-Toul included 263 patients. Among them, 111 were included in the ACE-CoV study population. In OW-PS-adjusted analyses, the association of exposure to ACEIs or ARBs with outcome occurrence was OR: 1.56 (95% CI: 0.73-3.33). It was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.68-1.45) for ACEIs and 1.64 (95% CI: 0.77-3.50) for ARBs. Analyses with weighting by the IPTW-PS method gave similar results. Results were similar when considering the subgroup of patients with arterial hypertension. The ACE-CoV study found no association between exposure to ACEIs or ARBs and unfavorable outcome in hospitalized patients for COVID-19 with a history of cardiovascular disease/arterial hypertension.","Lafaurie, Margaux; Martin-Blondel, Guillaume; Delobel, Pierre; Charpentier, Sandrine; Sommet, Agnès; Moulis, Guillaume",Fundamental & clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/fcp.12613; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111329/,130

Here, we assess the preliminary safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data from an ongoing single-center (in Jiangsu province, China), parallel-group, double-blind phase 1 trial of the vaccine candidate BNT162b1 in 144 healthy SARS-CoV-2-naive Chinese participants. These participants are randomized 1:1:1 to receive prime and boost vaccinations of 10 µg or 30 µg BNT162b1 or placebo, given 21 d apart, with equal allocation of younger (aged 18-55 years) and older adults (aged 65-85 years) to each treatment group (ChiCTR2000034825). BNT162b1 encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is one of several messenger RNA-based vaccine candidates under clinical investigation. Local reactions and systemic events were generally dose dependent, transient and mild to moderate. Fever was the only grade 3 adverse event. BNT162b1 induced robust interferon-γ T cell responses to a peptide pool including the RBD in both younger and older Chinese adults, and geometric mean neutralizing titers reached 2.1-fold (for younger participants) and 1.3-fold (for the older participants) that of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent human sera obtained at least 14 d after positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. In summary, BNT162b1 has an acceptable safety profile and produces high levels of humoral and T cell responses in an Asian population.","Li, Jingxin; Hui, Aimin; Zhang, Xiang; Yang, Yumei; Tang, Rong; Ye, Huayue; Ji, Ruiru; Lin, Mei; Zhu, Zhongkui; Türeci, Özlem; Lagkadinou, Eleni; Jia, Siyue; Pan, Hongxing; Peng, Fuzhong; Ma, Zhilong; Wu, Zhenggang; Guo, Xiling; Shi, Yunfeng; Muik, Alexander; Şahin, Uğur; Zhu, Li; Zhu, Fengcai",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01330-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33888900/,130

99710,Mental Health Impacts of Family Members Isolated from Patients in the ICU during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic.,2021-05-06,"OBJECTIVE To find out whether there was over-reporting of SARS patients in mainland China in view of the relatively low case fatality ratio in mainland China, in comparison with other affected countries and areas. METHODS We searched PubMed for all SARS antibody detection papers (in English or Chinese language) using the keywords 'SARS' and 'antibody'. Then the resulting articles were further read through to select the SARS detection results using ELISA methods of serum samples collected at least 1 month after disease onset. A multi-level logistic regression was applied to test for possible differences in the proportions positive between locations of the study. RESULTS A total of 48 studies were identified, including 39 from mainland China and nine from elsewhere (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada and Vietnam). For mainland China, there was no difference between Guangdong, Beijing and other provinces in the proportions testing positive (83.0%, 85.8% and 85.4% respectively). The grand average of 84.2% seropositive was lower than the 95.1% for the countries and areas outside of mainland China combined. However, this difference was far from significant after correcting for dependency of individual tests within the same study. CONCLUSIONS Our study showed no evidence of over-reporting of SARS in mainland China, nor in Guangdong, where the SARS epidemic started. Even if the lower seroprevalence in mainland China, relative to other affected areas, does represent actual over-reporting, then this factor can only explain a modest 10% of the lower case fatality in mainland China.","Liu, Wei; Han, Xiao-Na; Tang, Fang; Borsboom, Gerard J J M; Yang, Hong; Cao, Wu-Chun; de Vlas, Sake J",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02300.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19814761/,130
100092,Infectious communicable diseases: Are gender differences due to social structure or biology.,2021-03-01,"The focus of this article is on a male patient with hearing loss who was diagnosed with COVID-19 after returning to Taiwan from overseas. Due to the severe pneumonia infiltration, the patient received the clinical-trial treatment Remdesivir. In addition to facing the isolation and new-drug-related anxieties of the patient, the medical team faced difficulties in communicating effectively with the patient and in helping him through the isolation period. During the period of hospitalization (March 14th to April 13th, 2020), the author used Roy's adaptation model to perform a nursing assessment, which confirmed that the patient faced the following problems: (1) ineffective breathing pattern related to COVID-19, (2) impaired verbal communication related to hearing impairment, and (3) social isolation related to the isolation experience and the communication barrier with healthcare workers. During the nursing care process, the author helped the patient receive the antiviral treatment and taught him how to do diaphragmatic breathing in a comfortable, recumbent position to improve his breathing pattern. To reduce the difficulty of communication, the author made a pile of cards with common care-related words, provided pen and paper to write, and used a mobile-phone-based social-networking application to communicate with the patient. The author used writing to communicate with the patient and learned some simple signs from him to enable interaction. Moreover, the intervention helped him adapt to the isolation and treatment protocols to reach holistic nursing care. Based on this experience, the author suggests that hospitals cooperate with sign language organizations to teach healthcare workers simple communication skills, including sign language and cards to provide more complete care for patients with hearing loss during hospitalization.","Chen, Cheng-Hsuan; Pan, Mei-Yan; Liu, Hsiu-Yun",Hu li za zhi The journal of nursing,https://doi.org/10.6224/jn.202012_67(6).13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33274431/,130

An updated overview of systematic reviews.,2021,"OBJECTIVES Early reports from the initial months of the coronavirus pandemic reveal ethnic disparities in coronavirus incidence, severity, and mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between ethnicity and outcomes of coronavirus positivity and hospitalization. DESIGN An observational cohort study using electronic health record (EHR) data from a large community healthcare system in Washington State across the first phase of the pandemic (March 5 - June 7, 2020). RESULTS A total of 18,667 patients (65.9% of all tested) with EHR-documented ethnicity were included. Overall, 6.4% of patients tested positive for coronavirus. Among Latinx patients, 18.6% of those tested were positive, compared to only 4.0% of tested White patients. Multivariable logistic regression revealed significantly higher odds of positivity for Latinxs (aOR = 4.96, 95% CI 4.19-5.87), Asians (aOR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.74-3.08), Blacks (aOR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.43-2.31), and members of other ethnic minority groups (aOR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.80-2.95), compared to Whites in models adjusting for relevant confounders. Latinxs had a higher percentage of self-pay insurance (22.2%) compared to other ethnic groups (7.9-15.8%) and, among those who tested positive, were the only ethnic subpopulation with significantly higher odds than Whites to be hospitalized for COVID-19 (aOR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.45-3.33). We observed a positive correlation between infection and the percentage of Latinxs (r = 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.74), Blacks (r = 0.51, 95% CI 0.32-0.66), or Asians (r = 0.64, 95% CI 0.49-0.76) in a given zip-code. This correlationwas negative for Whites (r = -0.63, 95% CI -0.75, -0.45). CONCLUSIONS We present empirical evidence of higher rates of coronavirus positivity among People of Color compared to White people in Washington State. Social determinants of health, such as occupation, housing, healthcare access, and community structure, may contribute to health disparities in the coronavirus pandemic. Targeted capture of these variables in electronic health records is warranted to inform health equity analyses.","Pflugeisen, Bethann Mangel; Mou, Jin",Ethnicity & health,https://doi.org/10.1080/13557858.2020.1863922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33428455/,130

Ten calves (five males, five females; nine reticulated giraffes [Giraffa camelopardalis reticulata], one Masai giraffe [G. c. tippelskirchi]), were admitted under 2 days of age. Inadequate transfer of passive immunity was suspected in 5 of 10 calves based on assessment of serum total solids and globulin values. These calves were treated with oral frozen bovine colostrum and/or intravenous hyperimmune bovine plasma. Diarrhea occurred in 6 of 10 calves and was managed with supportive care, fecal microbiota transplantation, and limiting milk intake (offering 10% body weight [BW] in milk per day, while feeding <2 L per meal at 2- to 4-hr intervals). Less common diagnoses included pneumonia (n = 3) and mycoplasma-associated septic arthritis (n = 1). Eight calves received systemic antimicrobial therapy. Hyperlactatemia (lactate > 5 mmol/L; n = 8) and hypercreatininemia (creatinine > 2.0 mg/dl, n = 7) were the most common presenting laboratory abnormalities, which resolved with intravenous fluid therapy. All neonatal giraffes survived to discharge after a median hospitalization of 9.5 days (range, 5-37 days) and were successfully hand-reared at their place of birth. In conclusion, neonatal giraffe calves can be intensively managed in a hospital environment. Diarrhea was a common clinical problem and can be related to feeding regimens. Intravenous hyperimmune bovine plasma infusion was well tolerated to manage failure of transfer of passive immunity in calves with inadequate colostrum administration. The current study supports that compromised neonatal giraffe calves may carry an excellent prognosis after early, intensive intervention.","Dixon, Claire Elizabeth; Bedenice, Daniela; Restifo, Melissa; Mazan, Melissa; Brewer, Peter; Knafo, S Emmanuelle",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://doi.org/10.1638/2019-0021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827161/,130

BASIC RESEARCH DESIGN The study was carried out among 250 adults attending primary care clinics in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia). The study adopted a case-control approach, where diabetes status was first ascertained, and data collection carried out afterwards using questionnaires and periodontal examinations. Variations in the performance of the PPM by demographic (sex and age), socioeconomic (education) and behavioural factors (smoking status and last dental visit) were evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) regression. RESULTS The PPM including 3 periodontal parameters (missing teeth, percentage of sites with pocket depth ≥6mm and mean pocket depth) had an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.69 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.61-0.78), which dropped to 0.64 (95% CI: 0.53-0.75) after adjustment for covariates. Larger variations in performance were found by participants' sex, age and education, but not by smoking status or last dental visit. The PPM performed better among male (adjusted AUC: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.53 to 0.99), younger (0.67; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.84) and less educated participants (0.76; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.92).

103455,Stress in the Age of COVID-19.,2020-10-21,"N-glycolyl chondroitin (Gc-CN) is a metabolite of N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a sialic acid that is commonly found in mammals, but not humans. Humans can incorporate exogenous Neu5Gc into their tissues from eating red meat. Neu5Gc cannot be biosynthesized by humans due to an evolutionary mutation and has been implicated in causing inflammation causing human diseases, such as cancer. The study Neu5Gc is important in evolutionary biology and the development of potential cancer biomarkers. Unfortunately, there are several limitations to detecting Neu5Gc. The elimination of Neu5Gc involves a degradative pathway leading to the incorporation of N-glycolyl groups into glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as Gc-CN. Gc-CN has been found in humans and in animals including mice, lamb and chimpanzees. Here, we present the biosynthesis of Gc-CN in bacteria by feeding chemically synthesized N-glycolylglucosamine to Escherichia coli. A metabolically engineered strain of E. coli K4, fed with glucose supplemented with GlcNGc, converted it to N-glycolylgalactosamine (GalNGc) that could then be utilized as a substrate in the chondroitin biosynthetic pathway. The final product, Gc-CN was converted to disaccharides using chondroitin lyase ABC and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring detection. This analysis showed the incorporation of GalNGc into the backbone of the chondroitin oligosaccharide.","Awofiranye, Adeola E; Baytas, Sultan N; Xia, Ke; Badri, Abinaya; He, Wenqin; Varki, Ajit; Koffas, Mattheos; Linhardt, Robert J",AMB Express,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13568-020-01084-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803432/,130
103465,Change in Health-Related Socioeconomic Risk Factors and Mental Health During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A National Survey of U.S. Women.,2021-04-05,"Globally, there has been a recent surge in 'citizens' assemblies'1, which are a form of civic participation in which a panel of randomly selected constituents contributes to questions of policy. The random process for selecting this panel should satisfy two properties. First, it must produce a panel that is representative of the population. Second, in the spirit of democratic equality, individuals would ideally be selected to serve on this panel with equal probability2,3. However, in practice these desiderata are in tension owing to differential participation rates across subpopulations4,5. Here we apply ideas from fair division to develop selection algorithms that satisfy the two desiderata simultaneously to the greatest possible extent: our selection algorithms choose representative panels while selecting individuals with probabilities as close to equal as mathematically possible, for many metrics of 'closeness to equality'. Our implementation of one such algorithm has already been used to select more than 40 citizens' assemblies around the world. As we demonstrate using data from ten citizens' assemblies, adopting our algorithm over a benchmark representing the previous state of the art leads to substantially fairer selection probabilities. By contributing a fairer, more principled and deployable algorithm, our work puts the practice of sortition on firmer foundations. Moreover, our work establishes citizens' assemblies as a domain in which insights from the field of fair division can lead to high-impact applications.","Flanigan, Bailey; Gölz, Paul; Gupta, Anupam; Hennig, Brett; Procaccia, Ariel D",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03788-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34349266/,130
104741,COVID-19 and Mental Health.,2020-10-01,"Study Objective Patients presenting to emergency departments (ED) with transient ischemic attack and minor strokes (TIAMS) are often admitted for evaluation, though experience in other countries have suggested that an expedited outpatient care models may be a safe alternative. We hypothesized that a rapid access clinic for select TIAMS was feasible and would avert hospitalization costs. Methods This retrospective analysis included patients presenting to our institution's ED with TIAMS and NIHSS ≤5 in calendar year 2017. We referred low-risk patients with TIAMS to a Rapid Access Vascular Evaluation-Neurology (RAVEN) clinic within 24 hours of ED discharge. We identified admitted patients who met RAVEN criteria at ED presentation. Rates of follow-up to the RAVEN clinic were recorded. Financial data collected included total hospital costs and time spent in the ED, as well hospital length of stay for admitted patients with low-risk TIAMS. Results In 2017, 149 patients were referred to RAVEN clinic and 50 patients were admitted. Of the RAVEN patients 99 (94%) appeared as scheduled. None had clinical changes between ED discharge and clinical evaluation. One patient required hospitalization at the RAVEN evaluation. When compared to RAVEN patients, admitted patients had significantly higher $7,719 (SD 354) total hospital costs and were hospitalized for 2 days on average. Overall, the RAVEN strategy averted approximately $764,000 in hospitalization costs and 208 hospital bed-days in accounting year 2017. Conclusions For select patients presenting with TIAMS without disabling deficits, a rapid outpatient evaluation may be feasible while averting significant total hospital costs and preserving inpatient hospital beds.","Shapiro, Steven D; Boehme, Amelia K; Chang, Bernard P; Miller, Eliza C; Willey, Joshua; Elkind, Mitchell S V",The Neurohospitalist,https://doi.org/10.1177/1941874420972236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791052/,130

Leveraging a human stem cell differentiation model, we identify two clusters of enhancers within the PRS-associated region that regulate SOX9 expression during a restricted window of facial progenitor development at distances up to 1.45 Mb. Enhancers within the 1.45 Mb cluster exhibit highly synergistic activity that is dependent on the Coordinator motif. Using mouse models, we demonstrate that PRS phenotypic specificity arises from the convergence of two mechanisms: confinement of Sox9 dosage perturbation to developing facial structures through context-specific enhancer activity and heightened sensitivity of the lower jaw to Sox9 expression reduction. Overall, we characterize the longest-range human enhancers involved in congenital malformations, directly demonstrate that PRS is an enhanceropathy, and illustrate how small changes in gene expression can lead to morphological variation.","Long, Hannah K; Osterwalder, Marco; Welsh, Ian C; Hansen, Karissa; Davies, James O J; Liu, Yiran E; Koska, Mervenaz; Adams, Alexander T; Aho, Robert; Arora, Neha; Ikeda, Kazuya; Williams, Ruth M; Sauka-Spengler, Tatjana; Porteus, Matthew H; Mohun, Tim; Dickel, Diane E; Swigut, Tomek; Hughes, Jim R; Higgs, Douglas R; Visel, Axel; Selleri, Licia; Wysocka, Joanna",Cell stem cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2020.09.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991838/,130

MATERIALS AND METHODS Databases search was conducted from inception to December 2017 to identify randomized controlled trials using the Buzzy device for pain management in children undergoing needle-related procedures. Selection of studies, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias and quality of evidence were independently performed by 2 reviewers. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted. RESULTS A total of 9 studies involving 1138 participants aged between 3 and 18 years old were included in the systematic review and 7 were suitable for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis compared the Buzzy device with a no-treatment comparator and the effect of the device was significant in reducing self-report procedural pain (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.52 to -0.70; P<0.0001), parent-reported procedural pain (SMD: -0.94; 95% CI: -1.62 to -0.27; P=0.006), observer-report procedural pain (SMD: -1.19; 95% CI: -1.90 to -0.47; P=0.001), observer-reported procedural anxiety (SMD -1.37; 95% CI: -1.77 to -0.96; P<0.00001), and parent-reported procedural anxiety (SMD -1.36; 95% CI: -2.11 to -0.61; P=0.0004). There was no significant difference for the success of the procedure at first attempt and the occurrence of adverse events. DISCUSSION The Buzzy device seems to be a promising intervention for procedural pain management in children. However, the comparative effect is uncertain due to the presence of significant heterogeneity and very low-quality evidence. There is a need to improve the methodological quality and rigor in the design of future trials to conclude to the efficacy of the Buzzy device.","Ballard, Ariane; Khadra, Christelle; Adler, Samara; Trottier, Evelyne D; Le May, Sylvie",The Clinical journal of pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/ajp.0000000000000690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30829735/,130

The objective of this review is to map the existing types of integration platforms and review the evidence on integrated health and nutrition programmes' impacts on specific nutrition outcomes. A literature search was conducted, and integrated nutrition programmes were examined through the lens of the six World Health Organization (WHO) building blocks, including the demand side. Forty-five studies were included in this review, outlining the integration of nutrition-specific interventions with various programmes, including integrated community case management and Integrated Management of Childhood Illness, Child Health Days, immunization, early child development, and cash transfers. Limited quantitative data were suggestive of some positive impact on nutrition and non-nutrition outcomes with no adverse effects on primary programme delivery. Through the lens of the six WHO building blocks, service delivery and health workforce were found to be well-integrated, but governance, information systems, finance and supplies and technology were less well-integrated. Integrating nutrition-specific interventions into health systems may ensure efficient service delivery while having an impact on nutrition outcomes. There is no single successful model of integration; it varies according to the context and demands of the particular setting in which integration occurs. There is a need for more well-planned programmes considering all the health systems building blocks to ensure compliance and sustainability.","Salam, Rehana A; Das, Jai K; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A",Maternal & child nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1111/mcn.12738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30748112/,130

Most, but not all, of these changes affect low-income countries and are influenced by climate change. Tracking the recent and anticipated changes in the demographics and global distribution of these changes is essential for evolving effective new methods for dealing with the problems. The recent recognition by the United Nations of the importance of non-communicable diseases is a major positive step. For the sake of this paper, the following diseases were chosen: dengue and malaria, to highlight the role of climate change on vector-borne diseases. Drug-resistant tuberculosis illustrates the role of globalization and reduced resources on disease evolution. The continuing rise in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, particularly in resource-poor countries is largely attributed to lack of preventive and therapeutic measures against such conditions as hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis and congenital heart disease as well as neglected diseases, of which Chagas and rheumatic heart disease will be discussed further.","Yacoub, Sophie; Kotit, Susy; Yacoub, Magdi H","Philosophical transactions.

Forming of Poxviruses (Entomopoxvirinae) gene pool could be the beginning of transformation from Plants to Arthropoda (Carbon - 375 million years ago) with further evolution connected with Rodentia (Pliocene - 75-70 million years ago) and further separation of genera (500-300 thousand years ago), and respiratory transmission (epidemics) between humans (10-2 thousand years BC). Smallpox comeback would be possible. Orthomyxoviruses relicts (genus Isavirus) were possibly connected with Ichthya (Silurian - 500-410 million years ago), and then close interaction with Aves (the Cretaceous, 125-110 million years ago) with the division of genera and respiratory transmission (epidemics) between humans (10-2 thousand BC). Next pandemic of influenza A could be catastrophic in terms of the number of victims and economic damage.Coronaviruses formed a gene pool by interaction with Amphibia (subfamily Letovirinae) and then with Chiroptera in Tertiary (110-75 million years ago) with transformation to Artiodactyla (Eocene - 70-60 million years ago), and only 10-2 thousand years BC acquired the ability to a respiratory transmission and became Alphaviruses, a seasonal infection of humans.

In addition, imported, non-National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respirators have been donated or acquired by hospitals as a potential replacement for limited NIOSH-approved N95 respirators. Objective To assess fitted filtration efficiencies (FFEs) for face mask alternatives used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants For this quality-improvement study conducted between April and June 2020, we used the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Quantitative Fit Testing Protocol for Filtering Facepiece Respirators in a laboratory atmosphere supplemented with sodium chloride particles to assess the FFEs of a variety of respirators worn by a male volunteer and female volunteer. Main Outcomes and Measures The FFEs of respirators commonly worn by clinicians and other health care workers and available respirator alternatives during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Of the 29 different fitted face mask alternatives tested on 1 man and 1 woman, expired N95 respirators with intact elastic straps and respirators subjected to ethylene oxide and hydrogen peroxide sterilization had unchanged FFE (>95%). The performance of N95 respirators in the wrong size had slightly decreased performance (90%-95% FFE). All of the respirators not listed as approved in this evaluation (n = 6) failed to achieve 95% FFE. Neither of the 2 imported respirators authorized for use by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that were not NIOSH-approved tested in this study achieved 95% FFE, and the more effective of the 2 functioned at approximately 80% FFE. Surgical and procedural face masks had filtering performance that was lower relative to that of N95 respirators (98.5% overall FFE), with procedural face masks secured with elastic ear loops showing the lowest efficiency (38.1% overall FFE). Conclusions and Relevance This quality-improvement study evaluating 29 face mask alternatives for use by clinicians interacting with patients during the COVID-19 pandemic found that expired N95 respirators and sterilized, used N95 respirators can be used when new N95 respirators are not available. Other alternatives may provide less effective filtration.","Sickbert-Bennett, Emily E; Samet, James M; Clapp, Phillip W; Chen, Hao; Berntsen, Jon; Zeman, Kirby L; Tong, Haiyan; Weber, David J; Bennett, William D",JAMA internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.4221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32780113/,130

This study evaluated treatment-seeking insomnia patients and their self-report of sleep breathing complaints. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted on 1,035 consecutive treatment-seeking, chronic insomnia patients who reported insomnia as their primary problem upon seeking care at a private, community-based sleep medical center. Measurements included the insomnia severity index, standard subjective sleep measures as well as rankings, attributions, and self-reports about sleep breathing disorders, problems, and symptoms. RESULTS A total of 1,035 adult, treatment-seeking insomnia patients indicated insomnia interfered with daytime functioning, and their average insomnia severity was in the range of a clinically relevant problem: total sleep time (5.50 h, SD = 1.60), sleep efficiency (71.05 %, SD = 18.26), wake time after sleep onset (120.70 min, SD = 92.56), and an insomnia severity index (18.81, SD = 5.09). Of these 1,035 insomnia patients, 42 % also ranked a sleep breathing disorder among their list of reasons for seeking treatment, another 13 % revealed a concern about a sleep breathing problem, and another 26 % reported awareness of sleep breathing symptoms. Only 19 % of this clinical insomnia sample reported no awareness or concerns about sleep breathing disorders, problems, or symptoms. A greater proportion of men than women reported significantly more sleep breathing disorders, problems, or symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Sleep breathing complaints were extremely common among a large sample of treatment-seeking, self-identified, adult chronic insomnia patients. Prospective prevalence research is needed to corroborate or revise these findings, and polysomnography should be considered in appropriate cohorts to determine the clinical relevance of treatment-seeking chronic insomnia patients' sleep breathing complaints.","Krakow, Barry; Ulibarri, Victor A",Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11325-012-0694-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22467192/,130

112862,Mental health care for refugees and the need for cultural competence training in mental health professionals.,2020-10-19,"Frequent air travelers and airplane pilots may develop various types of illnesses. The environmental risk factors associated with air travel syndromes (ATS) or air travel-related adverse health outcomes raised concerns and need to be assessed in the context of risk management and public health. Accordingly, the aim of the present review was to determine ATS, risk factors, and mechanisms underlying ATS using scientific data and information obtained from Medline, Toxline, and regulatory agencies. Additional information was also extracted from websites of organizations, such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA), International Association for Medical Assistance to Travelers (IAMAT), and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Air travelers are known to be exposed to environmental risk factors, including circadian rhythm disruption, poor cabin air quality, mental stress, high altitude conditions, hormonal dysregulation, physical inactivity, fatigue, biological infections, and alcoholic beverage consumption. Consequences of ATS attributed to air travel include sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia), mental/physical stress, gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory diseases, circulatory-related dysfunction, such as cardiac arrest and thrombosis and, at worst, mechanical and terrorism-related airplane crashes. Thus safety measures in the cabin before or after takeoff are undertaken to prevent illnesses or accidents related to flight. In addition, airport quarantine systems are strongly recommended to prepare for any ultimate adverse circumstances. Routine monitoring of environmental risk factors also needs to be considered. Frequently, the mechanisms underlying these adverse manifestations involve free radical generation. Therefore, antioxidant supplementation may help to reduce or prevent adverse outcomes by mitigating health risk factors associated with free radical generation.","Kim, Jeum-Nam; Lee, Byung-Mu","Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

A qualitative study.,2020-09-08,"Introduction Antibody-mediated transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is caused by antibodies against human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) or human neutrophil antigens (HNAs), and is one of the most serious complications associated with transfusion medicine. Prevention strategies like testing allo-exposed female blood donors have not yet been introduced nationwide in Austria. To assess the need and feasibility of routine leukocyte antibody testing, the prevalence of leukocyte-reactive antibodies in an Austrian female donor population was been determined using classical cell-based methods which were compared with a high-throughput bead-based method. Methods Sera from 1,022 female blood donors were screened using a granulocyte aggregation test (GAT) and a white blood cell immunofluorescence test (WIFT) after retesting and specification of positive samples by granulocyte immunofluorescence test (GIFT) and monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization of granulocyte antigens (MAIGA). Potential HLA reactivities were confirmed using the microbeads assay LabScreenTM Mixed. The results in 142 donor sera and 38 well-defined reference sera were investigated by the microbeads assay LabScreenTM Multi and compared with classical cell-based methods. Results Reactivity with either granulocytes and/or lymphocytes was detected in 79 sera (7.7%), with the majority being HLA-specific. Antibodies against HNA were obtained in 7 samples (0.7%). The aggregating potential of the detected antibodies was observed in 9 cases (0.9%). Most of the leukocyte-reactive antibodies occurred at a donor age of between 35 and 59 years (n = 61). LabScreen Multi showed good agreement (κ = 0.767) for HNA antibody detection by cell-based assays, but double/multiple specificities (100% of 7 anti-HNA-1b sera) as well as false-negative results (40% of 15 HNA-3-specific sera) occurred. Discussion Leukocyte-reactive antibody screening is advised in Austrian female donors for safe blood transfusion, including single-donor convalescent plasma treatment of COVID-19 that may be implemented soon. For the introduction of LabScreen Multi, the combination with GAT should be considered to ensure correct anti-HNA-3a detection.","Schönbacher, Marlies; Aichinger, Nicole; Weidner, Lisa; Jungbauer, Christof; Grabmer, Christoph; Schuha, Beate; Rohde, Eva; Mayr, Wolfgang; Körmöczi, Günther",Transfusion medicine and hemotherapy : offizielles Organ der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Transfusionsmedizin und Immunhamatologie,https://doi.org/10.1159/000509946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33976610/,130
114295,Status of dental caries and associated factors in Tibetan adults: findings from the fourth China National Oral Health Survey.,2020-09-07,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded many existing healthcare delivery challenges including long waiting lists and cost containment. New challenges have arisen, such as demand on supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the implications of social distancing on staff, patients, and their families. Despite the pandemic, the need to deliver safe, urgent congenital cardiac surgery has remained. OBJECTIVE To demonstrate how Lean methodology can improve PPE supply chain demand and reduce staff exposure to children with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status undergoing congenital cardiac surgery, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We implemented the define, measure, analyze, improve, and control method (DMAIC) and Value Stream Maps to eliminate waste steps during testing for SARS-CoV-2 for children undergoing congenital cardiac surgery. RESULTS Following a 3-week period of implementation of this new value stream map, we reduced PPE set usage from 13 to 1 per patient, resulting in an annual saving of over €36,000 and reducing single-use plastic waste by nearly 70 000 pieces per annum. We reduced numbers of staff exposed to patients with an unknown SARS-CoV-2 status from 13 to 1. CONCLUSION The use of Lean methodology can reduce waste of PPE and plastic, resulting in cost savings, while reducing staff exposure when testing patients with congenital cardiac disease for SARS-CoV-2. By preventing admission of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, we can reduce use of isolation beds and prevent cancellation of surgery, improving patient flow and departmental efficiency. Other departments in our institution are implementing similar admission pathways to allow surgical services to restart during the ongoing pandemic.","Sheehan, John Robert; Lyons, Barry; Holt, Francesca",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.14102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33345391/,130

Being such a unique pathology, they can be easily confused and misdiagnose, exposing patients to unnecessary treatments. Case report Patient is an otherwise healthy 30-year-old patient without past medical history; after vigorous physical activity, a Bochdalek hernia was discovered and successfully treated; on follow-ups, he is doing well without signs of recurrence. Conclusions In adults, Bochdalek hernia is an uncommon form of diaphragmatic hernia. As most cases are asymptomatic, a high index of suspicion is needed since diagnosis is challenging. Modern surgical techniques can improve patient recovery and short hospital stay with minimal morbidity or mortality.","Tufiño, Jorge; Espin, Santiago; Reyes, Maria C; Zumárraga, Fernando; Marcelo Cevallos, J; Molina, Gabriel A; González, Hernán",Annals of medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33948164/,130

To identify the content, style, timing, tone, and initiation of communication that best connotes ""reassurance of worth"" from peers and supervisors in pharmacy academia. Methods. This study employed semi-structured interviews to acquire rich information from pharmacy faculty through a purposive sampling process. Academicians who had published in the area of worklife and/or were deemed likely to make substantial contributions to the interview were asked to participate. Participants represented a cross-section by discipline, institution, and demographic characteristics. An interview guide was constructed on the basis of motivating language theory (MLT) and provisions of social relationships theory. Interviews were conducted via zoom and transcribed verbatim. Themes were gleaned using open coding, then audited and member-checked. Results. Data saturation occurred after eight interviews. Two primary themes emerged, including 1) guidance - particularly related to professional development and tenure, and 2) reassurance of worth through invited participation, praise, and/or rewards. Interviewees highlighted the importance of empathetic, yet practical language among peers, and supervisor-initiated, meaning-making language opposed to generic platitudes. Conclusion. Empathetic, personal language that provides guidance and reassurance of worth can enhance faculty contributions and mitigate burnout. Invitations to collaborate are seen as collegial and engaging. This study demonstrated the usefulness of motivating language theory and social provisions in guiding communications among pharmacy academicians.","Desselle, Shane P; Clubbs, Brooke Hildebrand; Darbishire, Patricia",American journal of pharmaceutical education,https://doi.org/10.5688/ajpe8616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34301565/,130
117764,Adapting to the impact of COVID-19 on mental health: an international perspective.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has increasingly gained worldwide acceptance among bariatric surgeons during the past 10 years. Numerous articles have been written about the different approaches to the management of gastric fistulas, but limited data can be found concerning gastric stenosis after LSG. SETTING Private hospital, France. METHODS A total of 18 patients received endoscopic treatment for stenosis after LSG between May 2007 and June 2015. Stenosis was classified according to the endoscopic findings as functional (the passage of the endoscope was possible, but the sleeve was twisted with various degrees of rotation) or mechanical (the passage of the endoscope was very difficult or impossible). RESULTS This study included 13 women and 5 men, with an average age of 37.2±8.4 years and an average body mass index of 41.6±8.7 kg/m2. The average number of endoscopic procedures was 1.3 (range, 1-4). No patient had stent migration. The successful rate of endoscopic approach for stenosis of LSG was 94.4%, with one patient requiring conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The mean time from the LSG to the first endoscopic intervention was 28.2 days. All patients presented with midsleeve stricture, located near the incisura angularis, and no patient showed a stenosis in the upper part of the gastric tube. CONCLUSIONS The treatment of stenosis after LSG must be tailored to the clinical status of the patient and endoscopic findings. Both balloon dilation and stent deployment are useful and safe tools and must be used when appropriate.","Manos, Thierry; Nedelcu, Marius; Cotirlet, Adrian; Eddbali, Imane; Gagner, Michel; Noel, Patrick",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2016.08.491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27993491/,130
118294,Education interventions for health professionals on falls prevention in health care settings: a 10-year scoping review.,2020-11-09,"BACKGROUND Gestational diabetes (GDM) is increasingly common and has significant implications during pregnancy and for the long-term health of the mother and offspring. However, it is a heterogeneous condition with inter-related factors including ethnicity, body mass index and gestational weight gain significantly modifying the absolute risk of complications at an individual level. Predicting the risk of pregnancy complications for an individual woman with GDM presents a useful adjunct to therapeutic decision-making and patient education. Diagnostic prediction models for GDM are prevalent. In contrast, prediction models for risk of complications in those with GDM are relatively novel. This study will systematically review published prognostic prediction models for pregnancy complications in women with GDM, describe their characteristics, compare performance and assess methodological quality and applicability. METHODS Studies will be identified by searching MEDLINE and Embase electronic databases. Title and abstract screening, full-text review and data extraction will be completed independently by two reviewers. The included studies will be systematically assessed for risk of bias and applicability using appropriate tools designed for prediction modelling studies. Extracted data will be tabulated to facilitate qualitative comparison of published prediction models. Quantitative data on predictive performance of these models will be synthesised with meta-analyses if appropriate. DISCUSSION This review will identify and summarise all published prognostic prediction models for pregnancy complications in women with GDM. We will compare model performance across different settings and populations with meta-analysis if appropriate. This work will guide subsequent phases in the prognosis research framework: further model development, external validation and model updating, and impact assessment. The ultimate model will estimate the absolute risk of pregnancy complications for women with GDM and will be implemented into routine care as an evidence-based GDM complication risk prediction model. It is anticipated to offer value to women and their clinicians with individualised risk assessment and may assist decision-making. Ultimately, this systematic review is an important step towards a personalised risk-stratified model-of-care for GDM to allow preventative and therapeutic interventions for the maximal benefit to women and their offspring, whilst sparing expense and harm for those at low risk.

This study therefore aimed to explore these factors and their possible influence on sleep, circadian timing and narcolepsy symptoms during the pandemic. METHODS Patients with narcolepsy who had been in quarantine for at least three months completed a 36-question online survey. Questions targeted the conditions of the quarantine, sleep-related behaviors, and factors known to affect sleep and circadian rhythms (work status, income, appetite, narcolepsy symptoms, and medication), as well as the quality of life during the quarantine period. RESULTS The routines of the participants had been altered by quarantine, with changes in their place of work, and an increase in narcolepsy symptoms such as cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hallucinations, nocturnal awakenings, and sleepiness. Sleep and wake times changed, resulting in altered sleep patterns in the majority of the sample. No association between changes in the place of work and narcolepsy symptoms was found. Regarding medication, the participants used fewer antidepressant pills but took more stimulants. Appetite was increased and self-reported quality of life decreased during the period. CONCLUSIONS During the quarantine the patients with narcolepsy reported changes in their bedtime and waking-up schedules, suggesting a tendency to circadian misalignment. In Brazil, the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak have gone beyond the direct action of the virus, because of the collateral damage it has caused in respect of unemployment, financial hardship and a reduction in quality of life. These impacts have been amplified in Brazil because of the level of social inequality found in the country, and they have particularly affected vulnerable patients with rare diseases, such as the narcolepsy population.","Rodrigues Aguilar, Ana Carolina; Frange, Cristina; Huebra, Lucio; Dias Gomes, Ana Carolina; Tufik, Sergio; Santos Coelho, Fernando Morgadinho",Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.8952; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33124977/,130

However, it is unclear whether such a trend in treatment complexity can accelerate treatment centralization. The aim of this study was to reveal the current trend in the treatment of GBM in Japan. METHODS We used diagnostic procedure combination (DPC) database to analyze the data of 1,774 patients from 305 institutions between April 2016 and March 2019. To analyze the situations associated with first-line BEV use during concurrent TMZ (temozolomide)-radiotherapy, we compared TMZ alone and TMZ-BEV groups. RESULTS Of the 1,774 patients with GBM, tumor removal by craniotomy was performed in 1,572 (88.6%) patients, and stereotactic biopsy was performed in 156 (8.8%) patients. A total of 1,229 (69.3%) patients underwent radiotherapy, and 1,287 (72.5%) patients underwent chemotherapy. TMZ alone was administered to 878 (68.2%) and TMZ combined with BEV in 381 (29.6%) patients. In the TMZ-BEV group, as compared to the TMZ-alone group, the rate of discharge to home was significantly lower (P = 0.0044), and the rate of stereotactic biopsy was significantly higher (P < 0.0001). No significant difference was observed in the distribution of patients between the TMZ alone and TMZ-BEV groups depending on the scale of institution (P = 0.1240). CONCLUSION First-line BEV administration seems to be selected properly regardless of the institutional scale. This Japan-wide study of GBM treatment revealed that high level and newly introduced treatments have been steadily generalized in Japanese institutions.","Funakoshi, Yusuke; Hata, Nobuhiro; Kuga, Daisuke; Hatae, Ryusuke; Sangatsuda, Yuhei; Fujioka, Yutaka; Takigawa, Kosuke; Yoshimoto, Koji; Mizoguchi, Masahiro; Iihara, Koji",International journal of clinical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10147-021-01929-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974184/,130

Methods: In this retrospective study, the records of patients presented with diabetic macular edema (DME) and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy were reviewed. DME defined as clinically significant macular edema was treated by using argon green or yellow dye laser with focal, grid, and modified grid techniques according to Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study parameters. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was measured. BCVA change after the treatment and its relationship with other factors were evaluated. Results: The study included 133 eyes of 81 patients. The mean follow-up was 28.26 months. BCVA demonstrated the increase of 2 lines or more in 20.7% of the eyes, stabilization within 2 lines in 60.7% of the eyes, and loss of 2 lines or more in 18.3% of the eyes. The eyes with baseline BCVA lower than or equal to 0.50 showed a statistically significant increase (p=0.001) whereas the eyes with baseline BCVA of more than 0.50 did not show a statistically significant change (p=0.070) after laser photocoagulation treatment. Conclusions: Conventional laser photocoagulation is an effective treatment in diabetic macular edema including center-involved type and stabilizes visual acuity in the majority of the patients. Improvement in BCVA is significant in the group with lower baseline BCVA.

Posterior mediastinum parathyroid ectopia is rare, and glands need to be removed either with a broad open cervical or thoracic approach. In recent years, several minimally invasive approaches to mediastinal parathyroid glands have been described, but for posterior mediastinum adenomas, proposed techniques are transthoracic. METHODS The aim of this paper is to describe, to our best knowledge for the first time, a standardized pure endoscopic cervical technique to approach posterior mediastinal parathyroid adenomas which we have used in three patients. RESULTS The technique was applied in three patients which excellent surgical, postoperative, and cosmetic results. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopic prevertebral approach is a feasible, sure and inexpensive standardized pure endoscopic cervical approach to posterior mediastinal parathyroid adenomas, which may result in a less aggressive surgical option when compared with thoracic approaches.","Martos-Martínez, Juan Manuel; Sacristán-Pérez, Cristina; Pérez-Andrés, Marina; Durán-Muñoz-Cruzado, Virginia María; Pino-Díaz, Verónica; Padillo-Ruiz, Francisco Javier",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5197-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27553796/,130

METHODS We established the Nursing and Artificial Intelligence Leadership (NAIL) Collaborative, comprising interdisciplinary experts in AI development, biomedical ethics, AI in primary care, AI legal aspects, philosophy of AI in health, nursing practice, implementation science, leaders in health informatics practice and international health informatics groups, a representative of patients and the public, and the Chair of the ITU/WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health. The NAIL Collaborative convened at a 3-day invitational think tank in autumn 2019. Activities included a pre-event survey, expert presentations and working sessions to identify priority areas for action, opportunities and recommendations to address these. In this paper, we summarize the key discussion points and notes from the aforementioned activities. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING Nursing's limited current engagement with discourses on AI and health posts a risk that the profession is not part of the conversations that have potentially significant impacts on nursing practice. CONCLUSION There are numerous gaps and a timely need for the nursing profession to be among the leaders and drivers of conversations around AI in health systems. IMPACT We outline crucial gaps where focused effort is required for nursing to take a leadership role in shaping AI use in health systems. Three priorities were identified that need to be addressed in the near future: (a) Nurses must understand the relationship between the data they collect and AI technologies they use; (b) Nurses need to be meaningfully involved in all stages of AI: from development to implementation; and (c) There is a substantial untapped and an unexplored potential for nursing to contribute to the development of AI technologies for global health and humanitarian efforts.","Ronquillo, Charlene Esteban; Peltonen, Laura-Maria; Pruinelli, Lisiane; Chu, Charlene H; Bakken, Suzanne; Beduschi, Ana; Cato, Kenrick; Hardiker, Nicholas; Junger, Alain; Michalowski, Martin; Nyrup, Rune; Rahimi, Samira; Reed, Donald Nigel; Salakoski, Tapio; Salanterä, Sanna; Walton, Nancy; Weber, Patrick; Wiegand, Thomas; Topaz, Maxim",Journal of advanced nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34003504/,130

This 5-item scale, which was based on 775 adults with anxiety over the coronavirus, demonstrated solid reliability and validity. Elevated CAS scores were found to be associated with coronavirus diagnosis, impairment, alcohol/drug coping, negative religious coping, extreme hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as attitudes toward President Trump and Chinese products. The CAS discriminates well between persons with and without dysfunctional anxiety using an optimized cut score of ≥ 9 (90% sensitivity and 85% specificity).

122582,Who gets sick with what kinds of ailments and what are the politics of treatment?,2020-04-01,"Tobacco necrosis virus, strain D (TNV-D), is a positive-strand RNA virus in the genus Betanecrovirus and family Tombusviridae The production of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, p82, is achieved by translational readthrough. This process is stimulated by an RNA structure that is positioned immediately downstream of the recoding site, termed the readthrough stem-loop (RTSL), and a sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the TNV-D genome, called the distal readthrough element (DRTE). Notably, a base pairing interaction between the RTSL and the DRTE, spanning ∼3,000 nucleotides, is required for enhancement of readthrough. Here, some of the structural features of the RTSL, as well as RNA sequences and structures that flank either the RTSL or DRTE, were investigated for their involvement in translational readthrough and virus infectivity. The results revealed that (i) the RTSL-DRTE interaction cannot be functionally replaced by stabilizing the RTSL structure, (ii) a novel tertiary RNA structure positioned just 3' to the RTSL is required for optimal translational readthrough and virus infectivity, and (iii) these same activities also rely on an RNA stem-loop located immediately upstream of the DRTE. Functional counterparts for the RTSL-proximal structure may also be present in other tombusvirids. The identification of additional distinct RNA structures that modulate readthrough suggests that regulation of this process by genomic features may be more complex than previously appreciated. Possible roles for these novel RNA elements are discussed.IMPORTANCE The analysis of factors that affect recoding events in viruses is leading to an ever more complex picture of this important process. In this study, two new atypical RNA elements were shown to contribute to efficient translational readthrough of the TNV-D polymerase and to mediate robust viral genome accumulation in infections. One of the structures, located close to the recoding site, could have functional equivalents in related genera, while the other structure, positioned 3' proximally in the viral genome, is likely limited to betanecroviruses. Irrespective of their prevalence, the identification of these novel RNA elements adds to the current repertoire of viral genome-based modulators of translational readthrough and provides a notable example of the complexity of regulation of this process.","Newburn, Laura R; White, K Andrew",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02443-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28148800/,130

A limited number of studies have focused on the links between migrant smuggling and its impact on the risk of infectious diseases, including HIV, for those smuggled. To explore these links, we conducted in-depth interviews with 11 Asian and Pacific Americans (APA) living with HIV in New York and Los Angeles. Qualitative content analysis revealed that smuggled immigrants described their experience as one with opportunity and danger. Smuggled immigrants, who aimed to achieve their American dream, were influenced by hometown pioneers who successfully journeyed to the United States and by the prospect of gaining legal status through immigration policy similar to the 1986 amnesty. Unfortunately, the long and dangerous journey exposed the immigrants to health problems, including risk for HIV. Thus, health care providers for immigrants should assess their migration routes and screen for infectious diseases.","Huang, Feifei; Chen, Wei-Ti; Shiu, Cheng-Shi; Sun, Wenxiu; Radaza, Abigail; Toma, Lance; Luu, Binh Vinh; Ah-Yune, Judy",Clinical nursing research,https://doi.org/10.1177/10547738211008572; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34036840/,130

The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge of symptoms and modes of transmission of COVID-19, stress levels and clinical practice modifications of Turkish dentists during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey (15 questions) was sent to Turkish dentists from May 5 to 12 May, 2020. The survey comprised questions about dentists' demographic characteristics, their knowledge about COVID-19, stress levels and the measures taken in dental clinics against COVID-19. This study included a total of 1,095 Turkish dentists. The data were expressed as frequency with percentage values for overall variables. Dentists were most familiar with high fever among the symptoms of COVID-19 (99.4%) and 99.2% of them reported that COVID-19 was transmitted with eye, mouth and nasal mucosa contact on surfaces contaminated with the droplets of infected persons. While the stress levels of females were higher than males, the stress levels of dentists with more than 20 years of professional experience were found to be lower. Regarding the precautions to be taken as a preventive measure when working again, 86.6% of the dentists took precautions by increasing daily patient care intervals and only 38.4% of the dentists wore an N95 mask.

Fifty-seven consecutive, age-matched patients presenting with a tubal pregnancy were enrolled. In the LASS group, a 10 mm reusable umbilical optical trocar and a 10 mm suprapubic trocar was used. The other 30 patients were managed with multiport CL. All of the patients were asked to use the visual analogue scale and Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale to evaluate their cosmetic satisfaction. The duration of surgery was 21.19 ± 2.33 minutes for the LASS group and 36.9 ± 4.9 minutes for the CL group (p < .001). The postoperative 6th-hour VAS score was 2.44 ± 0.5 for the LASS group and 3.03 ± 0.8 for the CL group (p: .005). All of the PSAS and OSAS parameter scores were significantly lower in LASS group than CL group. In conclusion, the LASS procedure is a feasible method for treating ectopic pregnancies with a shorter surgical duration, lower VAS scores, and better cosmetic scores than CL. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Laparoscopy or laparotomy may be performed for the surgical management of ectopic pregnancy. Conventional laparoscopy has some advantages such as shorter hospital stay and recovery time and the better cosmetic results. However, the equipment used in conventional laparoscopy and single incision laparoscopy are more expensive than conventional open surgery equipment. What the results of this study add? Laparoscopy-assisted suprapubic salpingectomy (LASS) method has shorter operation time, lower VAS scores, better cosmetic scores and cheaper than conventional laparoscopy. What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The LASS procedure looks like a feasible method for treating ectopic pregnancies and the feasibility of this procedure should be confirmed by a larger series of patients and randomised trials.","Kaya, Cihan; Alay, Ismail; Eren, Ecem; Helvacioglu, Ozlem",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1080/01443615.2019.1604641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31334680/,130

A single surgeon performed all procedures. RESULTS Indications for surgery were recurrent incisional hernia in 33 % of patients and primary incisional or ventral abdominal hernias in the rest. Coated polyester mesh with an average size of 348 cm(2) (±214; range 113-1,036) was used. Mean operative time was 132 min (±66.1; range 53-412). The mean LOS was 4.0 days (±3.5; range 1-22). Complications occurred in 13 patients for overall morbidity of 16.5 % and no mortality. There was one recurrence in 30 days (1.1 %). Patients who had a surgery >120 min or a LOS >1 day were statistically more likely to have multiple hernias, larger defect sizes (>40 cm(2)), larger mesh sizes (>300 cm(2)) or a history of recurrent hernia (P < 0.05). No other clinical or demographic variable evaluated in this study correlated with operative time or LOS. CONCLUSIONS LVHR is safe with a low incidence of perioperative complications. Patients with multiple, larger and recurrent hernias have longer operative times and LOS. This information can be used to guide preoperative planning for the patient, surgeon and treating institution.","Butler, A R; Frelich, M J; Gould, J C; Goldblatt, M I",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-014-1250-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756916/,130
125723,"Racial discrimination in health care: An ""us"" problem.",2020-12-01,"Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has rapidly spread worldwide. As the earliest outbreak area of the pandemic, Wuhan, People's Republic of China, is gradually recovering to its normal state under the effective control of government authorities. Outpatient services in major hospitals are now being restored. An accumulation of asymptomatic infections is a potential risk for medical personnel, especially when there is crowding in hospitals. As the biggest center for orthopaedic patients in Wuhan, our orthopaedic outpatient department admits >300 patients per day. Optimal guidelines on how to handle this huge number of patients during the post-outbreak stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly with regard to potential asymptomatic infection, are urgently needed for orthopaedic surgeons. We have developed and proposed applicable guidelines to fill this knowledge gap, including the necessary protective strategies for medical personnel in orthopaedic outpatient and inpatient wards as well as during surgery. We also have provided mental health recommendations for health-care workers. To the best of our knowledge, these guidelines are the first of their kind for orthopaedic surgeons who are slowly reestablishing medical activity following the pandemic.","Xiong, Yuan; Chen, Lang; Lin, Ze; Panayi, Adriana C; Mi, Bobin; Liu, Guohui",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

127491,Meeting need vs. sharing the market: a systematic review of methods to measure the use of private sector family planning and childbirth services in sub-Saharan Africa.,2018,"BACKGROUND Because of uncertainties about the complexity of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair for varying patient populations, surgeons may be reluctant to perform this procedure. This study aimed to delineate the risk factors that can be identified in the preoperative setting predictive of longer operative times and complexity in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. METHODS Patient demographics including body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, previous laparoscopic and open surgical procedures, ventral hernia repairs, and hernia characteristics (defect size and location, adhesions, incarceration) were recorded prospectively. Data are given as mean +/- standard deviation. Times (min) required for abdominal access, adhesiolysis, and mesh placement as well as the total operative time were recorded during each case as outcome measures of operative difficulty. Univariate analyses were performed with the t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test as well as multivariate analyses using the stepwise analysis of covariance model to determine demographic and clinical variables influencing operative times. RESULT The study enrolled 180 patients (78 men and 102 women) with a mean age of 54.8 +/- 12.2 years and a mean BMI of 33.3 +/- 13.0 kg/m(2). Multivariate analysis demonstrated significantly longer (p < 0.05) adhesiolysis and total operative times for patients with prior ventral hernia repairs, suprapubic hernia, bowel adhesion to the abdominal wall or hernia sac, and larger hernia defect. The total operative time also was increased (p < 0.05) with incarcerated hernia contents. Mesh placement time was increased (p < 0.05) with incarcerated hernia contents, suprapubic hernia location, hernias requiring larger mesh for repair, and decreased postgraduate year of the surgical assistant. The time required to obtain abdominal access was longer (p < 0.05) with a greater BMI and a higher American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) classification. The operative times were not increased with a history of peritonitis, diabetes, immunosuppression, cancer, or with higher numbers of previous open or laparoscopic surgeries. CONCLUSIONS At least 10 preoperatively identifiable patient variables, either alone or in combination, are predictive of prolonged operative times during laparoscopic ventral hernia repair and may be used as surrogates to determine the complexity of a minimally invasive approach.","Jenkins, Eric D; Yom, Victoria H; Melman, Lora; Pierce, Richard A; Schuessler, Richard B; Frisella, Margaret M; Christopher Eagon, J; Michael Brunt, L; Matthews, Brent D",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0863-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20108146/,130
127978,Examination of nursing home financial distress via Porter's five competitive forces framework.,2020-11-11,"OBJECTIVES The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an unprecedented healthcare, social, and economic disaster. Wearing of masks and social distancing can significantly decrease transmission and spread, however due to circumstances such as medical or dental intervention and personal choice these practices have not been universally adopted. Additional strategies are required to lessen transmission. Nasal rinses and mouthwashes, which directly impact the major sites of reception and transmission of HCoV, may provide an additional level of protection against the virus. METHODS Common over-the-counter nasal rinses and mouthwashes/gargles were tested for their ability to inactivate high concentrations of HCoV using contact times of 30 sec, 1 min, and 2 min. Reductions in titers were measured by using the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) assay. RESULTS A 1% baby shampoo nasal rinse solution inactivated HCoV greater than 99.9% with a 2 min contact time. Several over-the-counter mouthwash/gargle products including Listerine and Listerine-like products were highly effective at inactivating infectious virus with greater than 99.9% even with a 30 sec contact time. CONCLUSION In the current manuscript we have demonstrated that several commonly available healthcare products have significant virucidal properties with respect to HCoV.

METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis were taken to compare the outcomes of GM and SM in open inguinal hernia repair. RESULTS A total of 1,353 patients in 6 randomized controlled trials and 2 observational studies were reviewed (666 patients in GM group; 687 patients in SM group). The 2 groups did not significantly differ in chronic groin pain (P = .23) or recurrence (P = .59). The operating time was significantly shorter in GM group (P < .00001). There was no significant difference in infection (P = .18), seromas (P = .35), hematomas (P = .87), or discomfort (P = .58) between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS The data showed that GM was equivalent to SM in open inguinal hernia repair. However, this new mesh still needs to be confirmed in large, multi-center, well-designed randomized controlled trials.","Fang, Zhixue; Zhou, Jianping; Ren, Feng; Liu, Dongcai",American journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2013.08.045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495321/,130

MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome N, Brower RG, Matthay MA, Morris A, Schoenfeld D, Thompson BT, Wheeler A, 2000 [1]) a prospective, quasi-experimental, cohort study of adults mechanically ventilated admitted to intensive care units (ICU) in the year before, year after, and second year after implementation of an electronic medical record based LPV order, and (Needham et al., 2015 [2]) a cross-sectional qualitative study of ICU providers regarding their perceptions of the order. We applied the Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to evaluate the implementation. RESULTS There were 1405, 1424, and 1342 in the control, adoption, and maintenance cohorts, representing 95% of mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients. The overall prevalence of LPV increased from 65% to 73% (p < 0.001, adjusted-OR for LPV adherence: 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2.3), but LPV adherence in women was approximately 30% worse than in men (women: 44% to 56% [p < 0.001],men: 79% to 86% [p < 0.001]). ICU providers noted difficulty obtaining an accurate height measurement and mistrust of the Vt calculation as barriers to implementation. LPV adherence increased further in the second year post implementation. CONCLUSION We designed and implemented an LPV order that sustainably improved LPV adherence across diverse ICUs.","Short, Briana; Serra, Alexis; Tariq, Abdul; Moitra, Vivek; Brodie, Daniel; Patel, Sapana; Baldwin, Matthew R; Yip, Natalie H",Journal of critical care,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2020.09.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004237/,130

132131,Homelessness and Mental Health: Part 1.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Although intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas are principally supplied by dural branches of the external carotid, internal carotid, and vertebral arteries, they can also be fed by pial arteries that supply the brain. We sought to determine the frequency of neurologic deficits following treatment of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas with and without pial artery supply. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred twenty-two consecutive patients who underwent treatment for intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas at our hospital from 2008 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient data were examined for posttreatment neurologic deficits; patients with such deficits were evaluated for imaging evidence of cerebral infarction. Data were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS Of 122 treated patients, 29 (23.8%) had dural arteriovenous fistulas with pial artery supply and 93 (76.2%) had dural arteriovenous fistulas without pial arterial supply. Of patients with pial artery supply, 4 (13.8%) had posttreatment neurologic deficits, compared with 2 patients (2.2%) without pial artery supply (P = .04). Imaging confirmed that 3 patients with pial artery supply (10.3%) had cerebral infarcts, compared with only 1 patient without pial artery supply (1.1%, P = .03). Increasing patient age was also positively associated with pial supply and treatment-related complications. CONCLUSIONS Patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas supplied by the pial arteries were more likely to experience posttreatment complications, including ischemic strokes, than patients with no pial artery supply. The approach to dural arteriovenous fistula treatment should be made on a case-by-case basis so that the risk of complications can be minimized.","Hetts, S W; Yen, A; Cooke, D L; Nelson, J; Jolivalt, P; Banaga, J; Amans, M R; Dowd, C F; Higashida, R T; Lawton, M T; Kim, H; Halbach, V V",AJNR.

We investigated the effect of smoking on outcome following endovascular therapy (EVT) with mechanical thrombectomy alone versus in combination with intra-arterial (IA-) thrombolysis. METHODS The primary endpoint was defined by three-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS). We performed a generalized linear model and reported relative risks (RR) for smoking (adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke severity, time to EVT) in patient data stemming from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive-Endovascular database. RESULTS Among 1,497 patients, 740(49.4%) were randomized to EVT; among EVT patients, 524(35.0%) received mechanical thrombectomy alone and 216(14.4%) received it in combination with IA-thrombolysis. Smokers (N = 396) had lower mRS scores (mean 2.9 vs. 3.2; p = 0.02) and mortality rates (10% vs. 17.3%; p<0.001) in univariate analysis. In all patients and in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy alone, smoking had no effect on outcome in regression analyses. In patients who received IA-thrombolysis (N = 216;14%), smoking had an adjusted RR of 1.65 for an mRS≤1 (95%CI 0.77-3.55). Treatment with IA-thrombolysis itself led to reduced RR for favorable outcome (adjusted RR 0.30); interaction analysis of IA-thrombolysis and smoking revealed that non-smokers with IA-thrombolysis had mRS≤2 in 47 cases (30%, adjusted RR 0.53 [0.41-0.69]) while smokers with IA-thrombolysis had mRS≤2 in 23 cases (38%, adjusted RR 0.61 [0.42-0.87]). CONCLUSIONS Smokers had no clear clinical benefit from EVT that incorporates IA-thrombolysis.","Kufner, Anna; Ali, Huma Fatima; Ebinger, Martin; Fiebach, Jochen B; Liebeskind, David S; Endres, Matthias; Siegerink, Bob",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251888; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34014988/,130
133415,The robot recruits in China's health-care system.,2020-06-01,"Autophagy is a cellular degradation process involving an intracellular membrane trafficking pathway that recycles cellular components or eliminates intracellular microbes in lysosomes. Many pathogens subvert autophagy to enhance their replication, but the mechanisms these pathogens use to initiate the autophagy process have not been elucidated. This study identifies rotavirus as a pathogen that encodes a viroporin, nonstructural protein 4, which releases endoplasmic reticulum calcium into the cytoplasm, thereby activating a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase-β and 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase-dependent signaling pathway to initiate autophagy. Rotavirus hijacks this membrane trafficking pathway to transport viral proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to sites of viral replication to produce infectious virus. This process requires PI3K activity and autophagy-initiation proteins Atg3 and Atg5, and it is abrogated by chelating cytoplasmic calcium or inhibiting calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase-β. Although the early stages of autophagy are initiated, rotavirus infection also blocks autophagy maturation. These studies identify a unique mechanism of virus-mediated, calcium-activated signaling that initiates autophagy and hijacks this membrane trafficking pathway to transport viral proteins to sites of viral assembly.","Crawford, Sue E; Hyser, Joseph M; Utama, Budi; Estes, Mary K",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1216539109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23184977/,130

METHODS Six photoelastic models were fabricated with an epoxy resin material (West System 105 Epoxy Resin/205 Fast Hardener, West System) to represent BJ and FE preparation configurations at 0° and 20° loading angulations. Lithium disilicate ceramic veneers (IPS e.max CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) were bonded to the BJ and FE photoelastic models using resin cement (IPS Variolink Esthetic, Ivoclar Vivadent). Each model was loaded using an Instron Universal Testing Machine at the incisal edge at a cross-head speed of 0.25 mm/min till 100 N. RESULTS BJ photoelastic model had more uniform distribution compared with FE photoelastic models under 0° and 20° loading angulations. CONCLUSION Parallel to the results of our earlier load-to-failure published study, both incisal preparation designs affect stress distribution within the ceramic veneer-tooth system. BJ photoelastic model demonstrated a more uniform distribution compared with FE photoelastic model.

The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a low-cost measure of physical function, which is a relevant dimension of recovery. The aim of the present study was to contribute further evidence for the validity of the 6MWT as a measure of postoperative recovery after colorectal surgery. METHODS This study involved a sample of 174 patients enrolled in three previous randomized controlled trials. Construct validity was assessed by testing the hypotheses that the distance walked in 6 min (6MWD) at 4 weeks after surgery is greater (1) in younger versus older patients, (2) in patients with higher preoperative physical status versus lower, (3) after laparoscopic versus open surgery, (4) in patients without postoperative complications versus with postoperative complications; and that 6MWD (5) correlates cross-sectionally with self-reported physical activity as measured with a questionnaire (CHAMPS). Statistical analysis was performed using linear regression and Spearman's correlation. The COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist was used to guide the formulation of hypotheses and reporting of results. RESULTS One hundred and fifty-one patients who completed the 6MWT at 4 weeks after surgery were included in the analysis. All hypotheses tested for construct validity were supported by the data. Older age, poorer physical status, open surgery and occurrence of postoperative complications were associated with clinically relevant reduction in 6MWD (>19 m). There was a moderate positive correlation between 6MWD and patient-reported physical activity (r = 0.46). CONCLUSIONS This study contributes further evidence for the construct validity of the 6MWT as a measure of postoperative recovery after colorectal surgery. Results from this study support the use of the 6MWT as an outcome measure in studies evaluating interventions aimed to improve postoperative recovery.","Pecorelli, Nicolò; Fiore, Julio F; Gillis, Chelsia; Awasthi, Rashami; Mappin-Kasirer, Benjamin; Niculiseanu, Petru; Fried, Gerald M; Carli, Francesco; Feldman, Liane S",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4478-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26310528/,130

Data are needed on the comparative safety, reactogenicity, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) effects of these vaccines. Objective To compare safety, reactogenicity, and changes in HRQOL scores after aIIV3 vs HD-IIV3. Design, Setting, and Participants This randomized blinded clinical trial was a multicenter US study conducted during the 2017 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019 influenza seasons. Among 778 community-dwelling adults aged at least 65 years and assessed for eligibility, 13 were ineligible and 8 withdrew before randomization. Statistical analysis was performed from August 2019 to August 2020. Interventions Intramuscular administration of aIIV3 or HD-IIV3 after age-stratification (65-79 years; ≥80 years) and randomization. Main Outcomes and Measures Proportions of participants with moderate-to-severe injection-site pain and 14 other solicited reactions during days 1 to 8, using a noninferiority test (5% noninferiority margin), and serious adverse events (SAE) and adverse events of clinical interest (AECI), including new-onset immune-mediated conditions, during days 1 to 43. Changes in HRQOL scores before and after vaccination (days 1, 3) were also compared between study groups. Results A total of 757 adults were randomized, 378 to receive aIIV3 and 379 to receive HD-IIV3. Of these participants, there were 420 women (55%) and 589 White individuals (78%) with a median (range) age of 72 (65-97) years. The proportion reporting moderate-to-severe injection-site pain, limiting or preventing activity, after aIIV3 (12 participants [3.2%]) (primary outcome) was noninferior compared with HD-IIV3 (22 participants [5.8%]) (difference -2.7%; 95% CI, -5.8 to 0.4). Ten reactions met noninferiority criteria for aIIV3; 4 (moderate-to-severe injection-site tenderness, arthralgia, fatigue, malaise) did not. It was inconclusive whether these 4 reactions occurred in higher proportions of participants after aIIV3. No participant sought medical care for a vaccine reaction. No AECI was observed. Nine participants had at least SAE after aIIV3 (2.4%; 95% CI,1.1% to 4.5%); 3 had at least 1 SAE after HD-IIV3 (0.8%; 95% CI, 0.2% to 2.2%). No SAE was associated with vaccination. Changes in prevaccination and postvaccination HRQOL scores were not clinically meaningful and not different between the groups. Conclusions and Relevance Overall safety and HRQOL findings were similar after aIIV3 and HD-IIV3, and consistent with prelicensure data.

Here, we assessed the efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion using cultured autologous BMSCs, comparing it with peripheral infusion, using our established canine liver fibrosis model. METHODS Canine BM cells were harvested and cultured, and the resultant BMSCs were returned to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver cirrhosis model canines via either a peripheral vein (Vein group) or hepatic artery (Artery group). A variety of assays were performed before and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after BMSC infusion, and liver fibrosis and indocyanine green (ICG) half-life (t1/2) were compared to those in a control group that received CCl4 but not BMSCs. The safety of this approach was evaluated by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and serial blood examinations after infusion. RESULTS Four weeks after infusing BMSCs, a significant improvement was observed in the Vein group (n = 8) compared to outcome in the Control group (n = 10), along with a decrease in ICG t1/2. In the Artery group (n = 4), ICG t1/2 was significantly shorter than that in the Vein group at 8 weeks (Δt1/2: -3.8 ± 1.7 min vs. +0.4 ± 2.4 min; p < 0.01) and 12 weeks (Δt1/2: -4.2 ± 1.7 min vs. +0.4 ± 2.7 min; p < 0.01) after BMSC administration. Post-infusion contrast-enhanced CT showed no liver infarction, and blood tests showed no elevations in either serum lactate dehydrogenase concentrations or hypercoagulability. CONCLUSIONS We confirmed the efficacy and safety of the hepatic arterial infusion of cultured autologous BMSCs using a canine model, thereby providing non-clinical proof-of-concept.","Nishimura, Tatsuro; Takami, Taro; Sasaki, Ryo; Aibe, Yuki; Matsuda, Takashi; Fujisawa, Koichi; Matsumoto, Toshihiko; Yamamoto, Naoki; Tani, Kenji; Taura, Yasuho; Sakaida, Isao",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673721/,130

A new strain of coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]) was identified and caused the first pandemic of the 21st century. The virus was officially detected in our country on March 11, 2020, and the number of cases increased rapidly; the virus was isolated in 670 patients within 10 days. The rapid increase in the number of patients has required our physicians to learn to protect both the public and themselves when treating patients with this highly infectious disease. The group most affected by the outbreak and with the highest mortality rate is elderly patients with known cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is necessary for cardiology specialists to take an active role in combating the epidemic. The aim of this article is to make a brief assessment of current information regarding the management of cardiovascular patients affected by COVID-19 and to provide practical suggestions to cardiology specialists about problems and questions they have frequently encountered.","Aktoz, Meryem; Altay, Hakan; Aslanger, Emre; Atalar, Enver; Atar, İlyas; Aytekin, Vedat; Baykan, Ahmet Oytun; Barçın, Cem; Barış, Nezihi; Boyacı, AsiyeAyça; Çavuşoğlu, Yüksel; Çelik, Ahmet; Çinier, Göksel; Değertekin, Muzaffer; Demircan, Sabri; Ergönül, Önder; Ertürk, Mehmet; Erol, M Kemal; Görenek, Bülent; Gürsoy, Mustafa Ozan; Hünük, Burak; Kahveci, Gökhan; Karabay, Can Yücel; Karaca, Ilgın; Kayıkçıoğlu, Meral; Keskin, Muhammed; Kılıç, Teoman; KılıçkıranAvcı, Burçak; Kırma, Cevat; Kocabaş, Umut; Kocakaya, Derya; Küçükoğlu, Serdar; Mutlu, Bülent; Nalbantgil, Sanem; Okuyan, Ertuğrul; Okyay, Kaan; KaptanÖzen, Deniz; Özgül, Sami; Özpelit, Ebru; Pirat, Bahar; Sert, Sena; Sinan, Ümit Yaşar; Şener, Yusuf Ziya; Tatlı, Ersan; Tekkeşin, Ahmet İlker; Tutar, Eralp; Ural, Dilek; Yıldırımtürk, Özlem; Yıldızeli, Bedrettin",Turk Kardiyoloji Dernegi arsivi : Turk Kardiyoloji Derneginin yayin organidir,https://doi.org/10.5543/tkda.2020.36713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32406873/,130

MATERIALS AND METHODS Women requiring postnatal thromboprophylaxis were given questionnaire packs exploring their beliefs about enoxaparin, anti-embolic stockings (AES) and intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPCD). Women were also asked to complete a diary recording when doses of enoxaparin were injected, along with an estimation of the number of hours the AES were worn each day, if at all. Results were entered onto SPSS and analysed. RESULTS Sixty-seven women completed the questionnaire packs. Adherence to enoxaparin therapy was relatively high (82.4%). Women self-reported sub-optimal adherence levels to the AES, with 24% stating they never wore them once home. Reasons for this included being mobile, feeling hot and feeling as if they were cutting circulation off in the legs. Women reported a high level of acceptance of IPCD post caesarean section and would be happy for IPCD to be applied again in future deliveries, if required. CONCLUSIONS Although many women are adherent to postnatal TP, our findings suggest that adherence to AES is sub-optimal following discharge from hospital and therefore their usefulness is questionable. Front-line clinical staff should discuss the importance of adherence to postnatal TP, in order to avert preventable venous thromboembolic events.","Guimicheva, Boriana; Patel, Jignesh P; Roberts, Lara N; Subramanian, Devi; Arya, Roopen",Thrombosis research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2018.11.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30500674/,130

Although the procedure with splenic vessel preservation (SVP) is optimal for LSPDP, SVP is not always possible in patients with a large tumor or a tumor attached to splenic vessels. This study aimed to analyze the safety of two procedures: LSPDP without SVP, known as the Warshaw technique (lap-WT), and LSPDP with SVP (lap-SVP). METHODS Seventeen patients who underwent a lap-WT and seven patients who underwent a lap-SVP were investigated retrospectively. RESULTS The median follow-up duration was 45 (range 17-105) months. In the lap-WT and lap-SVP patients, the sizes of the tumors were 5 (1.3-12) and 1.5 (1-4) cm; the operative times were 304 (168-512) and 319 (238-387) min; the blood loss was 210 (5-3250) and 60 (9-210) gr; the length of the postoperative hospital stay was 15 (8-29) and 18 (5-24) days; the peak platelet counts were 37.2 (14.6-65.2) and 26.4 (18.8-41) × 10(4)/μL, and splenomegaly was observed in 10 (59%) and three (43%) patients, respectively. In both procedures, there was no local recurrence. In the lap-WT group, splenic infarctions were seen in four (24%) patients and perigastric varices were seen in two (12%) patients. All of these patients were observed conservatively. CONCLUSIONS Both the lap-WT and lap-SVP were found to be safe and effective, and in cases in which the tumor is relatively large or close to the splenic vessels, lap-WT can be used as the more appropriate procedure.","Matsushima, Hajime; Kuroki, Tamotsu; Adachi, Tomohiko; Kitasato, Amane; Hirabaru, Masataka; Hidaka, Masaaki; Soyama, Akihiko; Takatsuki, Mitsuhisa; Eguchi, Susumu",Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

144307,Predictors of Severity and Change in Emotion Dysregulation among Children and Adolescents with ASD.,2021-08-09,"This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality and morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. The Special Report discusses the challenges of providing equitable health care for people with dementia in the United States. An estimated 6.2 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD. Official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in 2019, the latest year for which data are available, making Alzheimer's the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth-leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased more than 145%. This trajectory of deaths from AD was likely exacerbated in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 15.3 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2020. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at $256.7 billion in 2020. Its costs, however, extend to family caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes - costs that have been aggravated by COVID-19. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2021 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be $355 billion. Despite years of efforts to make health care more equitable in the United States, racial and ethnic disparities remain - both in terms of health disparities, which involve differences in the burden of illness, and health care disparities, which involve differences in the ability to use health care services. Blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans continue to have a higher burden of illness and lower access to health care compared with Whites. Such disparities, which have become more apparent during COVID-19, extend to dementia care. Surveys commissioned by the Alzheimer's Association recently shed new light on the role of discrimination in dementia care, the varying levels of trust between racial and ethnic groups in medical research, and the differences between groups in their levels of concern about and awareness of Alzheimer's disease. These findings emphasize the need to increase racial and ethnic diversity in both the dementia care workforce and in Alzheimer's clinical trials.",,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.12328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33756057/,130

The study was undertaken to provide information to the newly formed Preparedness Modeling Unit within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The focus was on the use of sophisticated mathematical models associated with three public health threats: pandemic influenza, radiologic release, and severe heat waves. The use of computer modeling and scenario-based analyses can be used to better frame problems and opportunities, integrate data sources, expect outcomes, and improve multistakeholder decision making. The results of the eight state needs assessment demonstrated that preparedness officials are familiar with models and would use computer modeling as a tool, along with other tools and general experiences, depending upon the perceived quality and validity of the model and the assumptions, as well as the applicability, of the model to their particular setting and population. More needs to be done to improve awareness and dissemination of available models and share best practices in both knowledge and use of models. Use of preparedness modeling would enhance the planning for vulnerable and at-risk populations, all-hazard emergencies and infectious disease containment strategies, as well as for response functions including evacuation, sheltering, quarantine, and distribution of medications and supplies.","Rosenfeld, Lisa A; Fox, Claude Earl; Kerr, Debora; Marziale, Erin; Cullum, Amy; Lota, Kanchan; Stewart, Jonathan; Thompson, Mary Zack",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.phh.0000346004.21157.ef; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19202407/,130

It is composed of a series of soluble and cell-bound proteins that are activated in a cascade effect, similar to the coagulation pathways. There are different pattern recognizing molecules that activate the complement system in response to stimuli or threats, acting through three initiation pathways: classical, lectin, and alternative. All three activation pathways converge at the C3 component and share the terminal pathway. The main outputs of the complement system action are lytic killing of microbes, the release of pro-inflammatory anaphylatoxins, and opsonization of targets. Laboratory testing is relevant in the setting of suspected complement deficiencies, as well as in the emerging number of diseases related to dysregulation (over-activation) of complement. Most common assays measure complement lytic activity and the different complement component concentrations. Specialized testing includes the evaluation of autoantibodies against complement components, activation fragments, and genetic studies. In this review, we cover laboratory testing for complement and the conditions with complement involvement, as well as current challenges in the field.","Willrich, Maria Alice V; Braun, Karin M P; Moyer, Ann M; Jeffrey, David H; Frazer-Abel, Ashley",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,https://doi.org/10.1080/10408363.2021.1907297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33962553/,130

Reports of recent outbreaks of a SARS-like disease caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have raised serious concerns of a possible reemergence of SARS-CoV, either by laboratory escape or the presence of a natural reservoir. Therefore, the development of effective and safe SARS vaccines is still needed. Based on our previous studies, we believe that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein is the most important target for developing a SARS vaccine. In particular, RBD of S protein contains the critical neutralizing domain (CND), which is able to induce highly potent neutralizing antibody response and cross-protection against divergent SARS-CoV strains. Furthermore, a RBD-based subunit vaccine is expected to be safer than other vaccines that may induce Th2-type immunopathology. This review will discuss key advances in the development of RBD-based SARS vaccines and the possibility of using a similar strategy to develop vaccines against MERS-CoV.","Zhu, Xiaojie; Liu, Qi; Du, Lanying; Lu, Lu; Jiang, Shibo",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2013.06.06; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23977435/,130

A 48-year-old man was diagnosed with HAM/TSP and started prednisolone therapy. Ten years later, he developed lymphoma-type ATL. At the diagnosis of ATL, Osame's Motor Disability Score (OMDS) was 4. When prednisolone was gradually tapered and stopped following chemotherapy for ATL, HAM/TSP symptoms recurred (OMDS 7). Bone marrow transplantation from a human leukocyte antigen allele 8/8 matched unrelated donor was performed while ATL was in partial remission. Neutrophil engraftment with complete donor chimerism was achieved on day 19 after allo-HSCT. Mild gait improvement (OMDS 5) was observed on day 30. Although ATL relapsed on day 275, progression of HAM/TSP symptoms was not observed. Furthermore, there was no clear progression of HAM/TSP symptoms after donor lymphocyte infusions.

We developed a compartmental model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Switzerland and projected the course of the epidemic until the end of year 2020 under various scenarios. The model was age-structured with three categories: children (0-17), adults (18-64) and seniors (65- years). Lifting all restrictions according to the plans disclosed by the Swiss federal authorities by mid-May resulted in a rapid rebound in the epidemic, with the peak expected in July. Measures equivalent to at least 90% reduction in all contacts were able to eradicate the epidemic; a 56% reduction in contacts could keep the intensive care unit occupancy under the critical level and delay the next wave until October. In scenarios where strong contact reductions were only applied in selected age groups, the epidemic could not be suppressed, resulting in an increased risk of a rebound in July, and another stronger wave in September. Future interventions need to cover all age groups to keep the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic under control.","Estill, Janne; Venkova-Marchevska, Plamenna; Roelens, Maroussia; Orel, Erol; Temerev, Alexander; Flahault, Antoine; Keiser, Olivia",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.24497.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34631035/,130
147297,COVID-19 and global mental health.,2021-06-01,"UNLABELLED Many viruses replicate most efficiently in specific phases of the cell cycle, establishing or exploiting favorable conditions for viral replication, although little is known about the relationship between caliciviruses and the cell cycle. Microarray and Western blot analysis of murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1)-infected cells showed changes in cyclin transcript and protein levels indicative of a G1 phase arrest. Cell cycle analysis confirmed that MNV-1 infection caused a prolonging of the G1 phase and an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase. The accumulation in G0/G1 phase was caused by a reduction in cell cycle progression through the G1/S restriction point, with MNV-1-infected cells released from a G1 arrest showing reduced cell cycle progression compared to mock-infected cells. MNV-1 replication was compared in populations of cells synchronized into specific cell cycle phases and in asynchronously growing cells. Cells actively progressing through the G1 phase had a 2-fold or higher increase in virus progeny and capsid protein expression over cells in other phases of the cell cycle or in unsynchronized populations. These findings suggest that MNV-1 infection leads to prolonging of the G1 phase and a reduction in S phase entry in host cells, establishing favorable conditions for viral protein production and viral replication. There is limited information on the interactions between noroviruses and the cell cycle, and this observation of increased replication in the G1 phase may be representative of other members of the Caliciviridae. IMPORTANCE Noroviruses have proven recalcitrant to growth in cell culture, limiting our understanding of the interaction between these viruses and the infected cell. In this study, we used the cell-culturable MNV-1 to show that infection of murine macrophages affects the G1/S cell cycle phase transition, leading to an arrest in cell cycle progression and an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, we show that MNV replication is enhanced in the G1 phase compared to other stages of the cell cycle. Manipulating the cell cycle or adapting to cell cycle responses of the host cell is a mechanism to enhance virus replication. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a norovirus interacting with the host cell cycle and exploiting the favorable conditions of the G0/G1 phase for RNA virus replication.","Davies, Colin; Brown, Chris M; Westphal, Dana; Ward, Joanna M; Ward, Vernon K",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03673-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25810556/,130

METHODS Sprague Dawley rats were divided into the following groups: no intervention, rapid restriction, regular exercise, and rapid restriction combined with regular exercise. Rats in the exercise group performed climbing exercise for 4 weeks. All rats consumed food ad libitum, and those in the rapid restriction group fasted for the last 3 days with no water on the last 1 day. RESULTS Despite no significant differences in body weight among the groups, the kidney weight was decreased when rapid restriction and regular exercise were combined. Rapid restriction reduced the urine volume and increased the urine osmolality, whereas regular exercise did not. Rapid restriction but not regular exercise increased the levels of circulating aldosterone and the renal expression levels of the ion channel SGK-1 compared to those without rapid restriction, indicating the stimulation of RAAS. Conversely, VPS showed no significant response to these interventions. Moreover, rapid restriction combined with regular exercise induced the renal expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased the active forms of apoptotic effector caspase-3 compared with the no intervention group. CONCLUSIONS Functional significance may differ between VPS and RAAS in water homeostasis in response to rapid restriction. Moreover, the combination of rapid restriction and regular exercise has potentially deleterious effects on the kidney.","Hasegawa, KazuyA; Yamaguchi, Yuya; Tanaka, Masashi",Physiological reports,https://doi.org/10.14814/phy2.14670; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400404/,130

148805,COVID-19 and Mental Health: Should We Expect an Increase in Disability?,2021-03-30,"BACKGROUND Periodontal diseases are responsible for a vast burden of disease globally and are associated with other severe illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases or diabetes. Tests for early diagnosis of periodontal diseases and effective treatments are available. The effectiveness of screening for periodontal diseases to detect periodontal diseases at an early stage during periodic health examinations at primary care facilities, however, is unclear. The objective of this systematic review is to assess the benefits and risks of screening for periodontal diseases in adults during the periodic health examinations. METHODS We will use two methodological approaches: (1) a systematic review to assess the effectiveness and risk of harms of screening for periodontal diseases during periodic health examinations and (2) an overview of systematic reviews to determine the effectiveness of treatment approaches for early periodontal disease. We will search electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com , the Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases, PubMed (non-MEDLINE content)) for published studies as well as sources for grey literature to detect unpublished studies. Two authors will independently screen abstracts and full texts using pre-defined eligibility criteria, select studies, extract data, and assess the risk of bias of included studies or reviews. In general, we will conduct a systematic narrative synthesis. Criteria for conducting meta-analyses were defined a priori. Our primary outcomes of interest are tooth loss, loosening of teeth, and depletion of bone tissue. Secondary outcomes are gingivitis/gum inflammation, pocket depths, dental hygiene, lifestyle modifications (e.g., smoking, alcohol, nutrition), and toothache. We consulted a panel of experts and patient representatives to prioritize these outcomes. Two investigators will assess independently the certainty of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. DISCUSSION We anticipate that our review will highlight the gaps in the available evidence about the effectiveness of screening for periodontal diseases during periodic health examinations. Implications for screening programs may be based on linked evidence about the validity of available screening tools and the effectiveness of early treatment.

Binary logistic regressions indicated employment status (odds ratio (OR) = 1.91; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.072-3.418) and binge drinking (OR = 2.03; 95% CI: 1.045-3.945) were significantly associated with depressive symptoms; gender (OR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.317-3.589), employment status (OR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.002-3.141) and binge drinking (OR = 2.62; 95% CI: 1.361-5.048) were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms; and binge drinking (OR = 3.42; 95% CI: 1.544-7.583) was significantly associated with stress symptoms. CONCLUSION Depression, anxiety and stress among Indian population during the lockdown were prevalent. Along with other measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, mental health of citizens needs the urgent attention of the Indian government and mental health experts. Further large-scale studies should be conducted on different professions and communities such as health care professionals and migrant workers and incorporate other mental health indicators.","Verma, Shankey; Mishra, Aditi",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020934508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32567466/,130

150306,A New Era for Occupational Hygiene.,2020-10-23,"Artemisinins are sesquiterpene lactones with a peroxide moiety that are isolated from the herb Artemisia annua. It has been used for centuries for the treatment of fever and chills, and has been recently approved for the treatment of malaria due to its endoperoxidase properties. Progressively, research has found that artemisinins displayed multiple pharmacological actions against inflammation, viral infections, and cell and tumour proliferation, making it effective against diseases. Moreover, it has displayed a relatively safe toxicity profile. The use of artemisinins against different respiratory diseases has been investigated in lung cancer models and inflammatory-driven respiratory disorders. These studies revealed the ability of artemisinins in attenuating proliferation, inflammation, invasion, and metastasis, and in inducing apoptosis. Artemisinins can regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), promote cell cycle arrest, drive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and induce Bak or Bax-dependent or independent apoptosis. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive update of the current knowledge of the effects of artemisinins in relation to respiratory diseases to identify gaps that need to be filled in the course of repurposing artemisinins for the treatment of respiratory diseases. In addition, we postulate whether artemisinins can also be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19 given its anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties.","Cheong, Dorothy H J; Tan, Daniel W S; Wong, Fred W S; Tran, Thai",Pharmacological research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32475812/,130
151420,"Physical Activity, Screen Time, and Mood Disturbance Among Chinese Adolescents During COVID-19.",2020-11-12,"PURPOSE Once open abdomen therapy has succeeded, the problem of closing the abdominal wall must be addressed. We present a new four-stage procedure involving the application of a two-component mesh and vacuum conditioning for abdominal wall closure of even large defects. The aim is to prevent the development of a giant ventral hernia and the eventual need for the repair of the abdominal wall. METHODS Nineteen of 62 patients treated by open abdomen over a two-year period could not receive primary abdominal wall closure. To achieve closure in these patients, we applied the following four-stage procedure: stage 1: abdominal damage control and conditioning of the abdominal wall; stage 2: attachment of a tailored two-component mesh of polyglycolic acid (PGA) and large pore polypropylene (PP) in intraperitoneal position (IPOM) plus placement of a vacuum bandage; stage 3: vacuum therapy for 3-4 weeks to allow granulation of the mesh and optimization of dermatotraction; stage 4: final skin suture. During stage 3, eligible patients were weaned from respirator and mobilized. RESULTS The abdominal wall gap in the 19 patients ranged in size from 240 cm(2) to more than 900 cm(2). An average of 3.44 vacuum dressing changes over 19 days were required to achieve 60-100 % granulation of the surface area, so final skin suture could be made. Already in stage 3, 14 patients (73.68 %) could be weaned from respirator an average of 6.78 days after placement of the two-component mesh; 6 patients (31.57 %) could be mobilized on the edge of the bed and/or to a bedside chair after an average of 13 days. No mesh-related hematomas, seromas, or intestinal fistulas were observed. CONCLUSION The four-stage procedure presented here is a viable option for achieving abdominal wall closure in patients treated with open abdomen, enabling us to avoid the development of planned giant ventral hernias. It has few complications and has the special advantage of allowing mobilization of the patients before final skin closure. Long-term course in a large number of patients must still confirm this result.","Dietz, U A; Wichelmann, C; Wunder, C; Kauczok, J; Spor, L; Strauß, A; Wildenauer, R; Jurowich, C; Germer, C T",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-012-0919-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22618090/,130

Objective To evaluate the independent risk factors associated with mortality of patients with COVID-19 requiring treatment in ICUs in the Lombardy region of Italy. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective, observational cohort study included 3988 consecutive critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 referred for ICU admission to the coordinating center (Fondazione IRCCS [Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico] Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy) of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network from February 20 to April 22, 2020. Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of nasopharyngeal swabs. Follow-up was completed on May 30, 2020. Exposures Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, long-term medications, and ventilatory support at ICU admission. Main Outcomes and Measures Time to death in days from ICU admission to hospital discharge. The independent risk factors associated with mortality were evaluated with a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Results Of the 3988 patients included in this cohort study, the median age was 63 (interquartile range [IQR] 56-69) years; 3188 (79.9%; 95% CI, 78.7%-81.1%) were men, and 1998 of 3300 (60.5%; 95% CI, 58.9%-62.2%) had at least 1 comorbidity. At ICU admission, 2929 patients (87.3%; 95% CI, 86.1%-88.4%) required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The median follow-up was 44 (95% CI, 40-47; IQR, 11-69; range, 0-100) days; median time from symptoms onset to ICU admission was 10 (95% CI, 9-10; IQR, 6-14) days; median length of ICU stay was 12 (95% CI, 12-13; IQR, 6-21) days; and median length of IMV was 10 (95% CI, 10-11; IQR, 6-17) days. Cumulative observation time was 164 305 patient-days. Hospital and ICU mortality rates were 12 (95% CI, 11-12) and 27 (95% CI, 26-29) per 1000 patients-days, respectively. In the subgroup of the first 1715 patients, as of May 30, 2020, 865 (50.4%) had been discharged from the ICU, 836 (48.7%) had died in the ICU, and 14 (0.8%) were still in the ICU; overall, 915 patients (53.4%) died in the hospital. Independent risk factors associated with mortality included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.75; 95% CI, 1.60-1.92), male sex (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.31-1.88), high fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.10-1.19), high positive end-expiratory pressure (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06) or low Pao2:Fio2 ratio (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74-0.87) on ICU admission, and history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.28-2.19), hypercholesterolemia (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.02-1.52), and type 2 diabetes (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01-1.39). No medication was independently associated with mortality (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.97-1.42; angiotensin receptor blockers HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.85-1.29).

We conducted a scoping review to determine the extent of ICU PR interventions and how they were reported and measured. Methods We searched five databases from inception to December 2016 for prospective studies evaluating adult ICU PR interventions. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts for inclusion. We assessed completeness of reporting using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology, or Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence guidelines, as appropriate. For planned PR interventions, we evaluated reporting with the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template (CERT) and assessed intervention and control groups separately. We calculated completeness of reporting scores for each study; scores represented the proportion of reported items. We compared reporting between groups using Kruskal-Wallis with Bonferroni corrections and t tests, α = 0.05. Results We screened 61,774 unique citations, reviewed 1429 full-text publications, and included 117: 39 randomized trials, 30 case series, 9 two-group comparison, 14 before-after, and 25 cohort. Interventions included neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) (14.5%), passive/active exercises (15.4%), cycling (6.8%), progressive mobility (32.5%), and multicomponent (29.9%). The median (first,third quartiles) study reporting score was 75.9% (62.5, 86.7) with no significant differences between reporting guidelines.

Over the last decade, robot-assisted surgery has become more commonly used as a minimally invasive approach for reconstructive upper urinary tract procedures. The aim of this study is to present our experience with robot-assisted ureteroneocystosctomy (RUNC) with a comparison with that of open ureteroneocystostomy (OUNC). PATIENTS AND METHODS Medical records of 25 patients who underwent RUNC and 41 patients who underwent OUNC or at our institution between 2000 and 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. Perioperative and postoperative data including demographics, surgical outcomes, and clinical and radiographic findings at postoperative follow-up were considered in the comparative analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to present the data. The significance of the difference between variables was evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous and Fisher exact test for categorical variables. RESULTS No significant differences were detected in terms of baseline patient characteristics between the two groups. The OUNC procedures were performed with a shorter median operative time (200 vs 279 min., P=0.0008), whereas RUNC patients had a shorter hospital stay (median 3 vs 5 days, P=0.0004), less narcotic pain requirement (morphine equivalent, mg 104.6 vs 290, P=0.0001), and less estimated blood loss (100 vs 150 mL, P=<0.0002). There as no significant difference in the rate of reoperation between groups: RUNC 2/25 (7.6 %) vs OUNC 4/41 (9.7%) P=0.8. Limitations include the retrospective nature of the study and the difference in indications for surgery. CONCLUSION RUNC provides excellent outcomes with shorter hospital stay, less narcotic pain requirement, and decreased blood loss when compared with the open procedure. Advantages of the robotic platform for dissection and suturing can be useful for complex minimally invasive urologic reconstructive procedures.","Isac, Wahib; Kaouk, Jihad; Altunrende, Fatih; Rizkala, Emad; Autorino, Riccardo; Hillyer, Shahab P; Laydner, Humberto; Long, Jean-Alexandre; Kassab, Ahmad; Khalifeh, Ali; Panumatrassamee, Kamol; Eyraud, Remi; Falcone, Tommasso; Haber, Georges-Pascal; Stein, Robert J",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2012.0196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22967284/,130

Primary care has been increasingly recognized as an underutilized platform to widely disseminate evidence-based parenting interventions, given parents' ongoing access to primary care without stigma and the perceptions toward health-care providers as a trustworthy source of information about positive parenting. This study sought to explore the effects of primary care-based parenting interventions on parenting practice and child behavioral outcomes while examining the types of and the theories of change underlying these interventions. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline. Randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies of interventions targeting caregivers of children aged between 1 and 17 were included in the review. Information sources included electronic databases, relevant government and private organizational websites, and expert consultations. The final sample included 17 studies focusing on 10 interventions. Positive results were found in knowledge gain, locus of control, monitoring, parent-child interactions, and negative discipline. Child behavior outcomes were inconsistent as most studies reported nonsignificant changes while one study reported significant intervention effects on various externalizing behaviors. A limited number of studies described the process of adapting, installing, and implementing the interventions in primary care. Future studies should examine the types, dosages, and delivery formats that are most suitable and sustainable in the context of primary care to maximize its utility in promoting child well-being while preventing maltreatment through integrated behavioral parenting interventions.","Moon, Deborah J; Damman, Jeri L; Romero, Aly","Trauma, violence & abuse",https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838018774424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30064299/,130

This study was to understand the route of disease origin and viral transmission in veterinary animals and in human through comparative pan-genomic analysis of coronavirus sequences, especially retrieved from genomes of FCoV and CCoV. Average nucleotide identity based on complete genomes might clustered CoV strains according to their infected host, with an exception of type II of CCoV (accession number KC175339) that was clustered closely to virulent FCoVs. In contrast, the hierarchical clustering based on gene repertories retrieved from pan-genome analysis might divided the examined coronaviruses into host-independent clusters, and formed obviously the cluster of Alphacoronaviruses into sub-clusters of feline-canine, only feline, feline-canine-human coronavirus. Also, functional analysis of genomic subsets might help to divide FCoV and CCoV pan-genomes into (i) clusters of core genes encoding spike, membrane, nucleocapsid proteins, and ORF1ab polyprotein; (ii) clusters of core-like genes encoding nonstructural proteins; (iii) clusters of accessory genes encoding the ORF1A; and (iv) two singleton genes encoding nonstructural protein and polyprotein 1ab. Seven clusters of gene repertories were categorized as common to the FCoV and/or CCoV genomes including pantropic and high virulent strains, illustrating that distinct core-like genes/accessory genes concerning to their pathogenicity should be exploited in further biotype analysis of new isolate. In conclusion, the phylogenomic analyses have allowed the identification of trends in the viral genomic data, especially in developing a specific control measures against coronavirus disease, such as the selection of good markers for differentiating new species from common and/or pantropic isolates.","Nguyen, Thanh Luan; Pham Thi, Hai Ha","Comparative immunology, microbiology and infectious diseases",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2021.101654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33957463/,130

160736,Transforming Behavioral Health Care in Virginia.,2021-03-18,"BACKGROUND A temperature probe placed in the lower third of the esophagus accurately reflects core temperature in anesthetized children. Temperature probes are commonly placed in the nasopharynx in children, but when utilizing an uncuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) with a softly audible leak, ventilated gases from the trachea can escape upwards toward the nasopharynx, thereby potentially causing a cooling effect in the nasopharynx. OBJECTIVES We sought to establish if nasopharyngeal and lower esophageal temperatures are in agreement in children undergoing general anesthesia, both in scenarios of ventilation with a cuffed ETT that has minimal or no leak (cuff up), as well as an ETT with leak (cuff down). METHODS A prospective, crossover agreement study was performed on anesthetized children. Children were intubated with a MicroCuff(®) ETT and had temperature probes inserted into both the nasopharynx and lower esophagus. Under standardized ventilator and gas flow settings, temperatures were recorded with the ETT cuff inflated, and with the cuff deflated. Bland-Altman plots were utilized to assess agreement of temperatures. RESULTS Fifty patients successfully completed this study. The mean difference between esophageal and nasopharyngeal temperature was found to be -0.03°C in the presence of minimal or no leak around the ETT (cuff up), with 95% limits of agreement (LOA) of -0.22 to 0.15°C. The mean difference between esophageal and nasopharyngeal temperature was found to be 0.1°C when a larger leak existed around the ETT (cuff down), with LOA of -0.31 to 0.51°C. CONCLUSIONS Nasopharyngeal temperature accurately reflects lower esophageal temperature when there is minimal or no ETT leak. When a larger ETT leak is present, nasopharyngeal temperature is on average 0.1°C cooler than lower esophageal temperature. As the nasopharyngeal temperature probe site confers the advantage of simplicity of accurate placement compared to its esophageal counterpart, our findings support the use of nasopharyngeal temperature probes in children ventilated with both cuffed and uncuffed ETTs.","Snoek, Aarjan P; Saffer, Emily",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.12830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26669266/,130

This study is focused on understanding the genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) among tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBL), a form of EPTB patients identified in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. METHODS The genetic diversity was identified by performing spoligotyping on the M.tb clinical isolates that were recovered from lymph node samples. A total of 71 M.tb isolates were recovered from extra pulmonary lymph node samples and subjected to Drug susceptibility testing and spoligotyping was carried out. In addition, immunological characterization from blood of same individuals from whom M.tb was isolated was carried out between the two major lineages groups East African Indian 3 (EAI3) and non-EAI3 strains by ELISA. The results of spoligotyping patterns were compared with the world Spoligotyping Database of Institute Pasteur de Guadeloupe (SpolDB4). RESULTS We found 41 spoligotype patterns and their associated lineages. Out of 41 spoligotype pattern, only 22 patterns are available in the spoldB4 database with Spoligotype international Type (SIT) number and remaining patterns were orphan strains without SIT number. The most predominant spoligotype lineage that was found in lymph node sample in this region of India was EAI (36), followed by central Asian strain (CAS) (6), T1 (5), Beijing (3), Latin American & Mediterranean (LAM) (2), U (1), X2 (1) and orphan (22). In addition to EAI, CAS and Beijing, our study identified the presence of orphan and unique spoligotyping patterns in Chennai region. We observed six drug resistant isolates. Out of six drug resistant isolates, four were resistant to isoniazid drug and associated with EAI family. Moreover, we observed increased levels of type 2 and type 17 cytokine profiles between EAI3 and non-EAI family, infected individuals.

161356,Are lonely older adults more vulnerable to mental health issues during pandemics?,2021-05-01,"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) accounts for approximately 10,000 annual cases of severe encephalitis in Europe and Asia. Here, we investigated the induction of the antiviral type I interferons (IFNs) (alpha/beta IFN [IFN-alpha/beta]) by TBEV. Using strains Neudörfl, Hypr, and Absettarov, we demonstrate that levels of IFN-beta transcripts and viral RNA are strictly correlated. Moreover, IFN induction by TBEV was dependent on the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). However, even strain Hypr, which displayed the strongest IFN-inducing activity and the highest RNA levels, substantially delayed the activation of IRF-3. As a consequence, TBEV can keep the level of IFN transcripts below the threshold value that would permit the release of IFN by the cell. Only after 24 h of infection have cells accumulated sufficient IFN transcripts to produce detectable amounts of secreted IFNs. The delay in IFN induction appears not to be caused by a specific viral protein, since the individual expressions of TBEV C, E, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5, and NS2B-NS3, as well as TBEV infection itself, had no apparent influence on specific IFN-beta induction. We noted, however, that viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), an important trigger of the IFN response, is immunodetectable only inside intracellular membrane compartments. Nonetheless, the dependency of IFN induction on IFN promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) as well as the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) suggest the cytoplasmic exposure of some viral dsRNA late in infection. Using ultrathin-section electron microscopy, we demonstrate that, similar to other flaviviruses, TBEV rearranges intracellular membranes. Virus particles and membrane-connected vesicles (which most likely represent sites of virus RNA synthesis) were observed inside the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, apparently, TBEV rearranges internal cell membranes to provide a compartment for its dsRNA, which is largely inaccessible for detection by cytoplasmic pathogen receptors. This delays the onset of IFN induction sufficiently to give progeny particle production a head start of approximately 24 h.","Overby, Anna K; Popov, Vsevolod L; Niedrig, Matthias; Weber, Friedemann",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00176-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20554782/,130

The aim was to evaluate the dynamics of rSO2 of the brain, preductal and postductal tissues during postnatal transition in preterm infants with and without respiratory support (RS). This single-centre study was designed as an exploratory prospective observational study. Fifty one preterm infants (≥ 30 + 0 and < 37 + 0 weeks) delivered by caesarean section were included. RS using a T-Piece-Resuscitator and supplemental oxygen were given according to guidelines. NIRS measurements were carried out by using Invos Monitor (Covidien; USA) for the first 15 min of life. Three NIRS transducers were attached on the forehead (rSO2brain), the right forearm (rSO2arm) and the left lower leg (rSO2leg). Two groups were compared based on need for RS: normal transition (NT) and RS group. RESULTS In NT group rSO2brain increased over time and was significantly higher than rSO2arm, whereas in RS group rSO2brain and rSO2arm increased without significant differences. Courses of rSO2arm and rSO2leg increased over time and showed a converging pattern with initially lower values of rSO2leg in NT group and a diverging pattern with lower levels of rSO2leg in RS group. Overall, rSO2 levels were higher in NT compared to RS group. CONCLUSION Our findings indicate that the decreased rSO2 levels in RS group compared to NT group are not only caused by lower arterial oxygen saturation levels, but also by a compromised perfusion even in infants with only mild respiratory distress.","Schwaberger, Bernhard; Pichler, Gerhard; Binder, Corinna; Avian, Alexander; Pocivalnik, Mirjam; Urlesberger, Berndt",Physiological measurement,https://doi.org/10.1088/0967-3334/35/10/2085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25243447/,130

Aim of the Study This study aimed to assess the prevalence and possible association between COVID-19 and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Patients and methods A 9-item questionnaire was sent to 120 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with a response rate of 66.67%. This cross-sectional observational study included 80 patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection who did not require hospitalization or steroid therapy. Results One or more HSV infections were observed in 28 patients (35%) with COVID-19 infection, including 10 males (35.7%) and 18 females (64.29%). Of the 28 patients, fever was reported in 17 patients (75%) during COVID-19. Most of the respondents (78%) described a single HSV reactivation, 14.29% had 2 attacks, and 7.14% experienced 3 attacks. Compared to previous non-COVID-19 related HSV reactivation, the COVID-19 related attacks were more severe in 12 patients (42.85%), equally severe in 5 patients (17.85%) and less severe in 1 patient (3.57%). Interestingly, 10 patients (35.71%) developed an initial symptomatic HSV attack during COVID-19 infection. Conclusions This study demonstrated a possible association between COVID-19 infection and primary HSV infection and/or reactivation. The COVID-19 direct neuronal effect in addition to COVID-19 related psychological stress, fever and immunological dysregulation could play a potential role.","Shanshal, M.; Ahmed, H.

Gardens have long been considered as refuges into which we retreat to escape various struggles and challenges. In this study we examine the characteristics and functions of the garden as a refuge during the period of increased garden interest associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of qualitative results about garden experiences from 3,743 survey respondents revealed intertwining garden and emotional geographies. Utilising non-representational and therapeutic landscape theories, we found multifarious and heightened experiences of non-material aspects of gardens;that is, the sensory and emotional aspects. People experienced, for example, a sense of joy, beauty, and reassurance, a greater attunement to the natural world and an increased sense of nature connection than they had at other times: birds felt louder. These heightened sensory and emotional experiences had therapeutic benefits, across age and geographical spectrums, during these difficult times. This research improves our understandings of the positive potential of non-material aspects of gardens in the creation of therapeutic landscapes in and beyond COVID-19.","Marsh, Pauline Diekmann Lucy O.; Egerer, Monika Lin Brenda Ossola Alessandro Kingsley Jonathan","Wellbeing, Space and Society",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wss.2021.100055,130

In order the determine its role, we measured plasma levels of Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 16 (CXCL16) in the plasma of COVID-19 hospitalized patients. CXCL16 interacts with CXCR6 promoting chemotaxis or cell adhesion. The CXCR6/CXCL16 axis mediates homing of T cells to the lungs in disease and hyper-expression is associated with localised cellular injury. To characterize the CXCR6/CXCL16 axis in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, plasma concentrations of CXCL16 collected at baseline from 115 hospitalized COVID-19 patients participating in ODYSSEY COVID-19 clinical trial were assessed together with a set of controls. We report elevated levels of CXCL16 in a cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Specifically, we report significant elevation of CXCL16 plasma levels in association with severity of COVID-19 (as defined by WHO scale) (P-value<0.02). Our current study is the largest thus far study reporting CXCL16 levels in COVID-19 hospitalized patients (with whole-genome sequencing data available). The results further support the significant role of the CXCR6/CXCL16 axis in the immunopathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and warrants further studies to understand which patients would benefit most from targeted treatments.","SMIESZEK, S.

In fact, though there have been some studies focusing on data breaches, little is known about what might constitute a “typical” response to data breaches whether those responses are effective at maintaining the stakeholders' relationship with the organization, their commitment to use the organization after the crisis, or the reputational threat of the crisis. Further, even less is known about the factors most influencing response and outcome evaluation during data breaches.Design/methodology/approachWe identify a “typical” response strategy to data breaches and then evaluate the role of this response in comparison to situation, stakeholder demographics and relationships between stakeholders, the issue and the organization using an experimental design. This experiment focuses on a 2 (type of organization) × 2 (prior knowledge of breach risk) with a control group design.FindingsFindings suggest that rather than employing reactive crisis response messaging the role of public relations should focus on proactive relationship building between organizations and key stakeholders.Originality/valueFor the last several decades much of the field of crisis communication has assumed that in the context of a crisis the response strategy itself would materially help the organization. These data suggest that the field crisis communication may have been making the wrong assumption. In fact, these data suggest that reactive crisis response has little-to-no effect once we consider the relationships between organizations, the issue and stakeholders. The findings show that an ongoing program of crisis capacity building is to an organization's strategic advantage when data security breaches occur.","Diers-Lawson, Audra Symons Amelia Zeng Cheng",Corporate Communications,https://doi.org/10.1108/ccij-02-2021-0024,130
171715,Mental health impact of covid on athletes,2021,"Purpose: Through the lens of Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, this study explores how remote working inhibits employee engagement. The authors offer a fresh perspective on the most salient work- and nonwork-related risk factors that make remote working particularly challenging in the context of Covid-19. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use data from semi-structured interviews with 32 employees working from home during the Covid-19 lockdown. Based on the interpretivist philosophical approach, the authors offer new insights into how employees can optimize work- and nonwork-related experiences when working remotely. Findings: The authors show that the sudden transition from in-person to online modes of working during the pandemic brought about work intensification, online presenteeism, employment insecurity and poor adaptation to new ways of working from home. These stress factors are capable of depleting vital social and personal resources, thereby impacting negatively on employee engagement levels. Practical implications: Employers, leaders and human resource teams should be more thoughtful about the risks and challenges employees face when working from home. They must ensure employees are properly equipped with the relevant resources and support to perform their jobs more effectively. Originality/value: While previous research has focused on the benefits of remote working, the current study explores how it might be detrimental for employee engagement during a pandemic. The study provides new evidence on the most salient risks and challenges faced by remote workers, and how the unique Covid-19 context has made them more pronounced. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adisa, T.

We studied a metapopulation stochastic epidemic model on a global scale that considers airline travel flow data among urban areas. We provided a temporal and spatial evolution of the pandemic with a sensitivity analysis of different levels of infectiousness of the virus and initial outbreak conditions (both geographical and seasonal). For each spreading scenario we provided the timeline and the geographical impact of the pandemic in 3,100 urban areas, located in 220 different countries. We compared the baseline cases with different containment strategies, including travel restrictions and the therapeutic use of antiviral (AV) drugs. We show that the inclusion of air transportation is crucial in the assessment of the occurrence probability of global outbreaks. The large-scale therapeutic usage of AV drugs in all hit countries would be able to mitigate a pandemic effect with a reproductive rate as high as 1.9 during the first year; with AV supply use sufficient to treat approximately 2% to 6% of the population, in conjunction with efficient case detection and timely drug distribution. For highly contagious viruses (i.e., a reproductive rate as high as 2.3), even the unrealistic use of supplies corresponding to the treatment of approximately 20% of the population leaves 30%-50% of the population infected. In the case of limited AV supplies and pandemics with a reproductive rate as high as 1.9, we demonstrate that the more cooperative the strategy, the more effective are the containment results in all regions of the world, including those countries that made part of their resources available for global use.","Colizza, Vittoria; Barrat, Alain; Barthelemy, Marc; Valleron, Alain-Jacques; Vespignani, Alessandro",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0701038v1.pdf,130

173168,Technology-Based PsychoSocial Management for Psychological Distress Due to Stigma Associated with COVID-19: A Case Study from North Karnataka,2021,"Influenza neuraminidase is an important drug target. Glycans are present on neuraminidase, and are generally considered to inhibit antibody binding via their glycan shield. In this work we studied the effect of glycans on the binding kinetics of antiviral drugs to the influenza neuraminidase. We created all-atom in silico systems of influenza neuraminidase with experimentally-derived glycoprofiles consisting of four systems with different glycan conformations and one system without glycans. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we observe a two- to eight-fold decrease in the rate of ligand binding to the primary binding site of neuraminidase due to the presence of glycans. These glycans are capable of covering much of the surface area of neuraminidase, and the ligand binding inhibition is derived from glycans sterically occluding the primary binding site on a neighboring monomer. Our work also indicates that drugs preferentially bind to the primary binding site (i.e. the active site) over the secondary binding site, and we propose a binding mechanism illustrating this. These results help illuminate the complex interplay between glycans and ligand binding on the influenza membrane protein neuraminidase. Statement of Significance The influenza glycoprotein neuraminidase is the target for three FDA-approved influenza drugs in the US. However, drug resistance and low drug effectiveness merits further drug development towards neuraminidase, which is hindered by our limited understanding of glycan effects on ligand binding. Generally, drug developers do not include glycans in their development pipelines. Here, we show that even though glycans can reduce drug binding towards neuraminidase, we recommend future drug development work to focus on strong binders with a long lifetime. Furthermore, we examine the binding competition between the primary and secondary binding sites on neuraminidase, leading us to propose a new, to the best of our knowledge, multivalent binding mechanism.","Seitz, Christian; Casalino, Lorenzo; Konecny, Robert; Huber, Gary; Amaro, Rommie E.; McCammon, J.

174231,Access to tertiary mental health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Romania,2021,"In the UK, there exists an important ""action gap"" between Government advice on measures necessary to counter the threat of COVID-19, and the behavior of a significant minority of the population. There are several reasons for this disconnect, including lack of message potency (i.e., credibility and congruence), inflexible/habitual behavior patterns, prevailing beliefs (i.e., vulnerability to, and seriousness of COVID-19), and individuals valuing personal concerns above general public health. For official messages to be effective and advice adhered to, strong, coherent ""strategic narratives"" are required. This article, using a psychological perspective, critically examined prevailing COVID-19 UK Government announcements during the lockdown (23/03/2020) and initial easing phase (10/05/2020). Specifically, it focused on important communication inconsistencies, and identified factors that may facilitate and create barriers to the adoption of essential public health directives. This included deliberation of factors that enhanced source impact, diminished the influence of message content, and the negative consequences of contrary information. Accordingly, this article proposes a framework for providing a unifying strategic narrative on COVID-19, one that helps to maximize the impact of key messages and promote effective behavior change. This framework places an emphasis on engaging the full range of actors and considers ways of reducing the efficacy of false information. The article provides recommendations that will potentially improve the reception of government policy and suggests how strategic narratives can harness the drivers of behavioral change needed to meet challenges such as COVID-19.","Dagnall, N.; Drinkwater, K.

To achieve this, governments have had to respond rapidly to outbreaks with public health interventions. But the exact characteristics of an outbreak that trigger these measures differ and are poorly defined. We used existing data from epidemics in Australia to establish a practical model to assist stakeholders in making decisions about the optimal timing and extent of interventions. We found that the number of reported cases on the day that interventions commenced strongly predicted the size of the outbreaks. We quantified how effective interventions were at containing outbreaks in relation to the number of cases at the time the interventions commenced. We also found that containing epidemics from novel variants that had higher transmissibility would require more stringent interventions that commenced earlier. In contrast, increasing vaccination coverage would enable more relaxed interventions. Our model highlights the importance of early and decisive action in the early phase of an outbreak if governments aimed for zero community transmission, although new variants and vaccination coverage may change this.","Zou, Z.; Fairley, C.

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative semi-structured interview design was adopted for this research. Seven participants were recruited from a harm reduction recovery organisation. During their initial interview, participants volunteered information regarding their experience of the first lockdown due to emerging concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed a second semi-structured interview at the end of the first lockdown regarding their experience of enforced isolation during this time. Findings Three themes identified from the analysis were isolation resulting in hindered human capabilities;adjusting to a new normal: an individual experience;and unexpected benefits to recovery resulting from isolation. While some participants reported boredom, loneliness and relapse events, others reported that the national response to the virus did not adversely affect them as they had already adjusted to living in a state of anxiety, isolation and uncertainty. These findings illuminate negative, neutral and positive aspects of substance use recovery throughout the COVID-19 lockdown as well as highlighting the complex and individualised role that social connectedness plays in relapse occurrence. Originality/value Participants reported differences in how they were affected by the pandemic, leading to theoretical implications for the effect of social isolation on recovery. For this reason, individuals with a history of dependency should be considered potentially vulnerable to the effects of enforced isolation and should be supported accordingly.","Smith, E.; Carter, M.; Walklet, E.; Hazel, P.",Drugs and Alcohol Today,https://doi.org/10.1108/dat-01-2021-0003,130
178556,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health: Potentially vulnerable groups and comorbidities,2021,"The lung contains multiple progenitor cell types that respond to damage, but how their responses are choreographed and why they decline with age is poorly understood. We report that histone H3 lysine 9 di-methylation (K9me2), mediated by histone methyltransferase G9a, regulates the dynamics of lung epithelial progenitor cells, and this regulation deteriorates with age. In aged mouse lungs, K9me2 loss coincided with lower frequency and activity of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell progenitors. In contrast, K9me2 loss resulted in increased frequency and activity of multipotent progenitor cells with bronchiolar and alveolar potential (BASCs) and bronchiolar progenitors. K9me2 depletion in young mice through deletion or inhibition of G9a decreased AT2 progenitor activity and impaired alveolar injury regeneration. Conversely, K9me2 depletion increased chromatin accessibility of bronchiolar cell genes, increased BASC frequency and accelerated bronchiolar repair. K9me2 depletion also resulted in increased bronchiolar cell expression of the SARS-CoV2 receptor Ace2 in aged lungs. These data point to K9me2 and G9a as a critical regulator of the balance of lung progenitor cell regenerative responses and prevention of susceptibility to age-related lung diseases. These findings indicate that epigenetic regulation coordinates progenitor cell populations to expedite regeneration in the most efficient manner and disruption of this regulation presents significant challenges to lung health.","Rowbotham, Samuel P.; Pessina, Patrizia; de Alba Rivas, Carolina Garcia; Li, Jingyun; Wong, Irene G.; Yoon, Joon; Fahey, Caroline; Moye, Aaron; Chongsaritsinsuk, Joann; Bronson, Roderick; Sui, Shannan J.

183131,Cleaning and disinfection in health care settings during the COVID-19 outbreak,2020-09-01,"In group testing, the goal is to identify a subset of defective items within a larger set of items based on tests whose outcomes indicate whether any defective item is present. This problem is relevant in areas such as medical testing, data science, communications, and more recently, utility in testing for COVID-19. Motivated by physical considerations, we consider a constrained setting in which each test can only contain a number of items up to some specified maximum value (Gandikota et al., 2019). While previous works have given recovery guarantees for this setting, there still exist significant gaps between the achievability and converse bounds when the maximum test size asymptotically increases as a function of the total number of items. In this paper, we partially close this gap by showing that the Definite Defectives (DD) algorithm, coupled with a suitable randomized test design, leads to an achievability result that improves on those of existing works, and is tight or near-tight in several regimes of interest. © 2021 IEEE.","Tan, N.; Scarlett, J.","2021 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, ISIT 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/isit45174.2021.9517947,130

Through the use of amazing astronomical photographs, science can be communicated effectively at different levels, to a very diverse audience of all ages. In fact, astrophotography combines aesthetic appeal with the illustration of the science behind astronomical phenomena. This is the aim of the exhibit""A che Punto \`e la NOTTE - A scientific exhibition of astrophotography""organized by us in Italy, in October 2020, with the partnership of the cultural association PhysicalPub. Many different authors, both single individuals and professional or amateur observatories, were asked to send their best pictures. The 54 astronomical images chosen by a scientific committee, categorised in three different topics (night landscape, deep sky, instrumentation), were seen by more than 2000 visitors and 11 school groups (despite the difficult period due to the COVID pandemic). A free audio-guide, available on-line through a web-application developed on purpose, delivered scientific explanations of images for self-guided tours. Conferences and guided tours were also organized. The highlight of the exhibit were four mirrors from the MAGIC telescope and an ASTRI scale-model that allowed an in-depth description of how an Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) works, introducing the science of VHE cosmic radiation. We will summarize the main difficulties in organizing this event and the feedback we had from the visitors.

185310,Mental health services.,1965,"Efficient wide-scale testing for SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for monitoring the incidence of the infection in the community. The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is the molecular analysis of epithelial secretions from the upper respiratory system captured by nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, which requires the intervention of trained personnel. Given the ease of collection, saliva has been proposed as a possible substitute to support testing at the population level. Here we describe the set-up of a laboratory, in an academic context, for the high-throughput screening of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva from the community. A novel saliva collection device was designed to favour the safe and correct acquisition of the sample as well as the processivity of the downstream molecular analysis. To test the performance of the system,1025 paired saliva and nasopharyngeal samples were collected from individuals recruited at a public drive through testing facility and analysed in parallel. An overall moderate concordance (68%) between the two tests was found, with evidence that neither test can diagnose the infection in 100% of the cases. While the two tests performed equally well in symptomatic individuals, their discordance was mainly restricted to samples from convalescent individuals. The saliva test was at least as effective as NP swabs in asymptomatic individuals recruited for contact tracing. Our study, therefore, indicates that saliva testing can be a reliable tool for wide-scale COVID-19 screening in the community.","Fronza, F.; Groff, N.; Martinelli, A.; Passerini, B.

188408,IAP-Child Health Initiative for Urban Slums.,2020-05-15,"The henipaviruses, Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV), are lethal emerging paramyxoviruses. EphrinB2 and ephrinB3 have been identified as receptors for henipavirus entry. NiV and HeV share similar cellular tropisms and likely use an identical receptor set, although a quantitative comparison of receptor usage by NiV and HeV has not been reported. Here we show that (i) soluble NiV attachment protein G (sNiV-G) bound to cell surface-expressed ephrinB3 with a 30-fold higher affinity than that of sHeV-G, (ii) NiV envelope pseudotyped reporter virus (NiVpp) entered ephrinB3-expressing cells much more efficiently than did HeV pseudotyped particles (HeVpp), and (iii) NiVpp but not HeVpp entry was inhibited efficiently by soluble ephrinB3. These data underscore the finding that NiV uses ephrinB3 more efficiently than does HeV. Henipavirus G chimeric protein analysis implicated residue 507 in the G ectodomain in efficient ephrinB3 usage. Curiously, alternative versions of published HeV-G sequences show variations at residue 507 that can clearly affect ephrinB3 but not ephrinB2 usage. We further defined surrounding mutations (W504A and E505A) that diminished ephrinB3-dependent binding and viral entry without compromising ephrinB2 receptor usage and another mutation (E533Q) that abrogated both ephrinB2 and -B3 usage. Our results suggest that ephrinB2 and -B3 binding determinants on henipavirus G are distinct and dissociable. Global expression analysis showed that ephrinB3, but not ephrinB2, is expressed in the brain stem. Thus, ephrinB3-mediated viral entry and pathology may underlie the severe brain stem neuronal dysfunction seen in fatal Nipah viral encephalitis. Characterizing the determinants of ephrinB2 versus -B3 usage will further our understanding of henipavirus pathogenesis.","Negrete, Oscar A; Chu, David; Aguilar, Hector C; Lee, Benhur",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17652392/,130

DESIGN A retrospective claims data analysis was conducted using the 2011 and 2012 Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounter Database. Study eligibility criteria included age 18-64 years, pharmacy coverage, ≥ 1 month of eligibility in 2012, and a claim coded with 1 of the 4 surgical procedures of interest; the index year was 2012. METHODOLOGY Average allowed facility and professional costs were calculated during inpatient stay (or day of surgery for outpatient hysterectomy) and the 30 days after discharge for MIS vs open surgery. Cost difference was compared after adjusting for presence of cancer, geographic region, and risk profile (age, gender, and comorbidities). RESULTS In total, 46,386 cases in the 2012 MarketScan database represented one of the surgeries of interest. The difference in average allowed surgical procedure cost (facility and professional) between open surgery vs adjusted MIS was $10,204 for colectomy; $3,721, ventral hernia repair; $12,989, thoracic resection; and $1,174, noncancer hysterectomy (P < .001 for all comparisons).The difference in average allowed cost in the 30 days after surgery between open surgery vs adjusted MIS was $1,494 for colectomy, $1,320 for ventral hernia repair, negative $711 for thoracic resection, and negative $425 for noncancer hysterectomy (P < .001 for all comparisons, except P = .487 for thoracic resection). CONCLUSION MIS was associated with statistically significantly lower costs than open surgery for all 4 analyzed surgeries.","Fitch, Kathryn; Engel, Tyler; Bochner, Andrew",Managed care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26521339/,130

It wasn't until the midtwentieth century that chloroquine was synthesized, followed by its further derivatives. Chloroquine inhibits protozoan polymerase activity, leading to an increase in heme, which is toxic to Plasmodium. The sensitivity of the protozoan to chloroquine depends on its ability to accumulate the drug in aquatic vacuolas. The medicine is also directly toxic to protozoa of the genus Entamoeba histolytica. The immunomodulatory properties of chloroquine have led to its use in collagen diseases, rheumatic disease, chronic rheumatoid and ankylosing arthritis and autoimmune skin disease. Chloroquine has recently been shown to be effective in controlling infection caused by the new Corona virus 2019- nCov (SARS-CoV-2). The drug inhibits viral infectivity by increasing endosomal pH in cells and blocking virus-cell interference by glycosylating SARS-CoV-2 cell receptors. Chloroquine has been shown to be able to bind sialic acid and gangliosides effectively by blocking the combination of virus S protein with gangliosides, which prevents the infection from starting. The effectiveness of the drug in the first stage of infection by SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in clinical observations and the drug was included in the developed therapeutic recommendations.","Płusa, Tadeusz; Lengier-Krajewska, Monika; Baranowska, Alicja; Krawczyk, JarosŁaw",Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32564047/,130

Preoperative prediction of the risk for kyphosis could help to avoid such postoperative complications. We attempted to predict the postoperative development of kyphosis in 59 patients scheduled for cervical anterior fusion using autologous vertebral bone grafting. Of these, 36 underwent single and 23 two level fusion with median follow up of 58.2 months. Whole spine alignment, fused segment alignment, and mobility of the intervertebral disc were compared using pre- and postoperative radiographs. Alignment of the whole spine changed from 13.7 degrees to 11.1 degrees , and the angle of the fused segment changed from 3.6 degrees to -3.2 degrees . Postoperative alignment was not worse than the preoperative flexion posture in any of the 59 patients. Forty-nine patients with preoperative lordotic alignment did not develop postoperative kyphosis. Nine patients with preoperative straight alignment had several types of postoperative alignment, including kyphosis. Two patients with postoperative kyphosis showed marked loss in the angle of the fused segment, which affected mobility to flexion of the fused segment. One patient with preoperative kyphotic alignment manifested postoperative kyphosis. The postoperative alignment was influenced by the preoperative alignment. Kyphosis may develop in patients with preoperative straight alignment and large mobility to flexion of the fused segment.

The purpose of the article is to investigate the concept of the right to non-interference in privacy and the problems of ensuring it, development of proposals to improve the legislation of Ukraine. The methodological ground of the study is based on general and specific methods of scientific knowledge (formal-logical method, comparative-legal, structural-logical). The empirical base of the study is international documents, decisions of the ECHR in medical and legal cases, current legal acts of Ukraine, governing this sphere of legal relations, and assessment of Ukrainian and foreign experts. As a result of the study it was argued that the restriction of the right to non-interference in privacy and subjective legal rights, which are its structural elements, is possible only in such a way that is guaranteed by law, and solely to achieve the goal of protecting the state, society and individual citizens. Based on the analysis of the practice of the ECHR in medical and legal cases, it was found that namely the involvement of a forensic expert or doctor helps to identify and record traces of a criminal offence, special signs, and that these persons can indicate to authorized officials, conducting muster process, the nature of the actions that pose a threat to the health of the person, who is to be mustered and which are prohibited by law, thereby determining the limits of admissibility of intervention.

The disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, whose transmission mechanism most relevant to dentistry is through respiratory droplets and possibly also aerosols, as well as direct contact with mucous membranes of the nose, mouth or eye via contaminated hands or objects. The professionals of the dental health units have a high risk exposure since they work at short distances (less than 1 m from the head of the patient) in the oral cavity, where a maximal expression of possible cell receptors for the virus has been reported. Also, most procedures in the dental cabinet imply aerosol generation. Cross-infection is possible during dental care, not only with diagnosed COVID-19-positive patients but also with patients who remain undetected due to asymptomatic or presymptomatic disease. For all these reasons, dental care in the primary health setting has had to change in order to adapt to the pandemic.

This will enable governments and policy-makers to make evidence-based decisions. This international study reports the association between workplace factors and the mental health of HCWs during the pandemic. METHODS: An international, cross-sectional study was conducted in 41 countries. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms, derived from the validated Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). Multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with mental health outcomes. Inter-country differences were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 2527 responses were received, from 41 countries, including China (n = 1213; 48.0%), UK (n = 891; 35.3%), and USA (n = 252; 10.0%). Of all participants, 1343 (57.1%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 2021 (80.0%) were female; 874 (34.6%) were doctors, and 1367 (54.1%) were nurses. Factors associated with an increased likelihood of depressive symptoms were: working in the UK (OR = 3.63; CI = [2.90-4.54]; p < 0.001) and USA (OR = 4.10; CI = [3.03-5.54]), p < 0.001); being female (OR = 1.74; CI = [1.42-2.13]; p < 0.001); being a nurse (OR = 1.64; CI = [1.34-2.01]; p < 0.001); and caring for a COVID-19 positive patient who subsequently died (OR = 1.20; CI = [1.01-1.43]; p = 0.040). Workplace factors associated with depressive symptoms were: redeployment to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (OR = 1.67; CI = [1.14-2.46]; p = 0.009); redeployment with perceived unsatisfactory training (OR = 1.67; CI = [1.32-2.11]; p < 0.001); not being issued with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (OR = 2.49; CI = [2.03-3.04]; p < 0.001); perceived poor workplace support within area/specialty (OR = 2.49; CI = [2.03-3.04]; p < 0.001); and perceived poor mental health support (OR = 1.63; CI = [1.38-1.92]; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This is the first international study, demonstrating that workplace factors, including PPE availability, staff training pre-redeployment, and provision of mental health support, are significantly associated with mental health during COVID-19. Governments, policy-makers and other stakeholders need to ensure provision of these to safeguard HCWs' mental health, for future waves and other pandemics.","Khajuria, Ankur; Tomaszewski, Wojtek; Liu, Zhongchun; Chen, Jian-Hua; Mehdian, Roshana; Fleming, Simon; Vig, Stella; Crawford, Mike J",BMC Health Serv Res,,130

Genomic epidemiology is an important tool to assess the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Several mutations have been reported by genome analysis of the SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we investigated the mutational and phylogenetic analysis of 30 whole-genome sequences for the virus's genomic characteristics in the specimens collected in the early phase of the pandemic (March-June, 2020) and the sudden surge of local transmission (August-September, 2020). The four samples in the early phase of infection were B.6 lineage and located within a clade of the samples collected at the same time in Singapore and Malaysia, while five returnees by rescue flights showed the lineage B. 1.36.1 (three from India), B.1.1 (one from India) and B.1.80 (one from China). However, there was no evidence of local spread from these returnees. Further, all 19 whole-genome sequences collected in the sudden surge of local transmission showed lineage B.1.36. The surge of the second wave on SARS-CoV-2 infection was linked to the single-introduction of a variant (B.1.36) that may result from the strict restriction of international travel and containment efforts.

Methods: We used the Koch Institute data on COVID-19 cases in Germany. To minimize the effect of changes in healthcare seeking behavior and testing practices, we included the following 5-year age groups in the analyses: 10-14y through 45-49y. For each age group g, we considered the proportion PL(g) of individuals in age group g among all detected cases aged 10-49y during weeks 13-14, 2020 (later period), as well as corresponding proportion PE(g) for weeks 10-11, 2020 (early period), and the relative risk RR(g)=PL(g)/PE(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, a higher value of RR(g1) compared to RR(g2) is interpreted as the relative increase in the population incidence of SARS-Cov-2 for g1 compared to g2 for the later vs. early period. Results: The relative risk was highest for individuals aged 20-24y (RR=1.4(95% CI (1.27,1.55))), followed by individuals aged 15-19y (RR=1.14(0.99,1.32)), aged 30-34y (RR= 1.07(0.99,1.16)), aged 25-29y (RR= 1.06(0.98,1.15)), aged 35-39y (RR=0.95(0.87,1.03)), aged 40-44y (RR=0.9(0.83,0.98)), aged 45-49y (RR=0.83(0.77,0.89)) and aged 10-14y (RR=0.78(0.64,0.95)). Conclusions: The observed relative increase with time in the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) among COVID-19 cases is unlikely to be explained by increases in the likelihood of seeking medical care/being tested for individuals in those age groups compared to individuals aged 35-49y or 10-14y, suggesting an actual increase in the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the German population. That increase likely reflects elevated mixing among individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) compared to other age groups, possibly due to lesser adherence to social distancing practices.","Goldstein, Edward",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02817v1.pdf,130

To this end, a comparative analysis was conducted with a focus on the forms of participation and age of sport activity participants. For the final comparative analysis, a 2 × 3 factorial multivariate analysis of variance was conducted after confirming the validity and reliability of data based on 229 questionnaires collected from healthy respondents who have never been infected with COVID-19. The results showed statistically significant differences between worry about illness, which is a subscale of hypochondriasis, disease phobia, thanatophobia, and intent to continue according to age. Statistically significant differences were also found when considering the type of sport for worry about illness, which is a subscale of hypochondriasis, disease phobia, symptom preoccupation, and intent to continue. Furthermore, interaction effects between the two independent variables, i.e., age and type of sport, were found for disease phobia, a subscale of hypochondriasis, and thanatophobia. In summary, age and type of sport, which are important factors for the COVID-19 infection and symptoms, were found to affect the sport activity patterns. These results proved that COVID-19 may have caused the participants to have different perceptions depending on their characteristics and change their form of continuous participation. These findings will provide useful data for predicting the perception and behavioral patterns of sports participants if diseases like COVID-19 occur in the future. They also show how to live a healthy life through exercise.","Choi, Chulhwan; Bum, Chul-Ho",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,130

The aim of the current study was to assess the effects of perceived social support on compliance with stay-at-home orders in response to a COVID-19 outbreak during the Persian New Year (Nowruz) holydays, since Nowruz holidays of 2020 coincided with the peak of the coronavirus epidemic in Iran. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was carried out based on phone interviews of 1073 adults aged over 18 years from 4 to 12 April 2020 in Mashhad, Khorasan-Razavi Province, as the second largest city of Iran. A systematic random sampling was carried out using fixed phone number lists provided by Telecommunication Company of Khorasan-Razavi Province. Phone interviews were carried out by trained interviewers from the Iranian Students Polling Agency (ISPA) at various times of the day. The survey included sociodemographic questions, perceived social support scale (MSPSS) and questions about self-isolation during the Nowruz holiday. Statistical analysis included Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: 20.5% of participants reported poor compliance with stay at home orders during the first 2 weeks of Nowruz. Clear social gradients were not found in stay-at-home compliance. When controlling socio-demographic factors, perceived social support, interestingly, both fostered and hindered people's compliance with stay at home orders, depending on the source of support from family members (OR = .874, 95% CI = .803, .950, p < .005), friends (OR = 1.147, 95% CI = 1.076, 1.222, p < .001) and a significant other person (OR = .926, 95% CI = .849, 1.010, p = .084). CONCLUSIONS: Public health messaging may need to emphasize the role that friends and families can play in helping to protect those in their friendship/family groups by promoting compliance with social distancing. Further in-depth studies are recommended to evaluate how this kind of messaging can most effectively encourage people to engage in social distancing practices.","Paykani, Toktam; Zimet, Gregory D; Esmaeili, Reza; Khajedaluee, Amir Reza; Khajedaluee, Mohammad",BMC Public Health,,130

214055,DETECT Schools Study Protocol: A Prospective Observational Cohort Surveillance Study Investigating the Impact of COVID-19 in Western Australian Schools,2021,"PURPOSE: The long incubation period and asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 present considerable challenges for health care institutions when patients return to elective surgery. METHODS: A retrospective review of the first adult elective cases performed between May 18, 2020 and June 14, 2020, after the end of lockdown was analysed in Belgium to answer the following questions: (1) for the 236 cancelled patients during the outbreak, how easy was rescheduling? (2) How useful was universal RT-PCR testing and chest CT scan for the 211 orthopaedic and trauma admissions? (3) How were surgical difficulty category, number of operations and complications different when compared to the pre-COVID period? (4) How would patients balance the benefit of surgery against the unknown risk of developing COVID-19? RESULTS: Before surgery, blood tests for anaesthesiology and imaging related to the surgical procedure were scheduled prior to universal testing (COVID-19 PCR and chest CT) performed 72-120 hours before surgery. Among the 211 asymptomatic patients who were tested before surgery, six had positive PCR, while no abnormality was found on the chest CT scan of all the patients. With this timing for tests, the 104 patients included in the current study for elective surgery were free of disease before undergoing surgery and remained without COVID-19 after surgery. Among the 366 cancelled patients during the outbreak, only 12% of the patients accepted to proceed with rescheduling immediately. Therefore, this resulted in a 70% reduction for elective surgery and in a 50% reduction for arthroplasties as compared to pre-COVID period. The rate of complications was not increased during the post-COVID period. A portion of patients have confused idea of screening and have difficulty to perceive the new rules of health organization. CONCLUSIONS: Resumption of elective surgical procedures appears more difficult for patients than for surgeons with a low percentage of cancelled patients accepting to reschedule surgery. Universal testing allowed securing patients; however, surgeons must explore better patient perceptions regarding COVID-19 to facilitate a fully informed decision in the current period.","Hernigou, Jacques; Valcarenghi, Jérome; Safar, Adonis; Ferchichi, Mohamed Amine; Chahidi, Esfandiar; Jennart, Harold; Hernigou, Philippe",Int Orthop,,130

215799,Global mental health and COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Mononuclear phagocytes (MPs), including macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs), are phagocytic cells with important roles in immunity. The developmental origin of kidney DCs has been highly debated because of the large phenotypic overlap between macrophages and DCs in this tissue. METHODS: We used fate mapping, RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and histo-cytometry to assess the origin and phenotypic and functional properties of renal DCs in healthy kidney and of DCs after cisplatin and ischemia reperfusion-induced kidney injury. RESULTS: Adult kidney contains at least four subsets of MPs with prominent Clec9a-expression history indicating a DC origin. We demonstrate that these populations are phenotypically, functionally, and transcriptionally distinct from each other. We also show these kidney MPs exhibit unique age-dependent developmental heterogeneity. Kidneys from newborn mice contain a prominent population of embryonic-derived MHCIInegF4/80hiCD11blow macrophages that express T cell Ig and mucin domain containing 4 (TIM-4) and MER receptor tyrosine kinase (MERTK). These macrophages are replaced within a few weeks after birth by phenotypically similar cells that express MHCII but lack TIM-4 and MERTK. MHCII+F4/80hi cells exhibit prominent Clec9a-expression history in adulthood but not early life, indicating additional age-dependent developmental heterogeneity. In AKI, MHCIInegF4/80hi cells reappear in adult kidneys as a result of MHCII downregulation by resident MHCII+F4/80hi cells, possibly in response to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). RNA sequencing further suggests MHCII+F4/80hi cells help coordinate the recruitment of inflammatory cells during renal injury. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct developmental programs contribute to renal DC and macrophage populations throughout life, which could have important implications for therapies targeting these cells.","Salei, Natallia; Rambichler, Stephan; Salvermoser, Johanna; Papaioannou, Nikos E; Schuchert, Ronja; Pakalniskyte, Dalia; Li, Na; Marschner, Julian A; Lichtnekert, Julia; Stremmel, Christopher; Cernilogar, Filippo M; Salvermoser, Melanie; Walzog, Barbara; Straub, Tobias; Schotta, Gunnar; Anders, Hans-Joachim; Schulz, Christian; Schraml, Barbara U",J Am Soc Nephrol,,130

This prospective cohort study of the correlates of the risk of death in COVID-19 patients was conducted at the Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care units of Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy. The clinical characteristics of all the COVID-19 patients hospitalised in the early days of the epidemic (21 February -19 March 2020) were recorded upon admission, and the time-dependent probability of death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method (censored as of 20 April 2020). Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the factors independently associated with the risk of death. Forty-eight (20.6 %) of the 233 patients followed up for a median of 40 days (interquartile range 33-47) died during the follow-up. Most were males (69.1 %) and their median age was 61 years (IQR 50-72). The time-dependent probability of death was 19.7 % (95 % CI 14.6-24.9 %) 30 days after hospital admission. Age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.08, 95 % CI 1.48-2.92 per ten years more) and obesity (aHR 3.04, 95 % CI 1.42-6.49) were independently associated with an increased risk of death, which was also associated with critical disease (aHR 8.26, 95 % CI 1.41-48.29), C-reactive protein levels (aHR 1.17, 95 % CI 1.02-1.35 per 50 mg/L more) and creatinine kinase levels above 185 U/L (aHR 2.58, 95 % CI 1.37-4.87) upon admission. Case-fatality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the early days of the Italian epidemic was about 20 %.

217852,Is There a Future for Primary Care?,2021,"Data on the performance of saliva specimens for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in ambulatory patients are scarce and inconsistent. We assessed saliva-based specimens for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) in the community setting and compared three different collection methods. This prospective study was conducted in three primary care centers. RT-PCR was performed on paired nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples collected from outpatients with a broad clinical spectrum of illness. To assess differences in collection methods, saliva specimens were obtained in a different way in each of the participating centers: supervised collection (SVC), oropharyngeal washing (OPW), and self-collection (SC). Pairs of NPS and saliva samples from 577 patients (median age, 39 years; 44% men; 42% asymptomatic) were collected and tested, and 120 (20.8%) gave positive results. The overall agreement with NPS results and kappa coefficients (&#954;) for saliva samples obtained by SVC, OPW, and SC were 95% (&#954; = 0.85), 93.4% (&#954; = 0.76), and 93.3% (&#954; = 0.76), respectively. The sensitivities (95% confidence intervals [95% CI]) of the saliva specimens ranged from 86% (72.6% to 93.7%) for SVC to 66.7% (50.4% to 80%) for SC samples. Sensitivity was higher for samples with lower cycle threshold (CT ) values. The best RT-PCR performance was observed for SVC, with sensitivities (95% CI) of 100% (85.9% to 100%) in symptomatic individuals and 88.9% (50.7% to 99.4%) in asymptomatic individuals at CT values of &#8804;30. We conclude that saliva is an acceptable specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the community setting. Specimens collected under supervision perform comparably to NPS and can effectively identify individuals at higher risk of transmission under real-life conditions.","Fernández-González, Marta; Agulló, Vanesa; de la Rica, Alba; Infante, Ana; Carvajal, Mar; García, José Alberto; Gonzalo-Jiménez, Nieves; Cuartero, Claudio; Ruiz-García, Montserrat; de Gregorio, Carlos; Sánchez, Manuel; Masiá, Mar; Gutiérrez, Félix",J. clin. microbiol,,130

A questionnaire based study on 574 COVID-19 positive patients admitted in a dedicated COVID hospital between September-November, 2020 were followed up until their sensations recovered completely or maximum for two months. Fever was the most common symptom reported. Loss of smell and taste sensation is seen in 200 (34.84%) and 269 (46.86%) patients respectively; 163 (28.4%) developed both. Males were affected significantly more than females (p = 0.030 and 0.027). Approximately 1/4th patients [49 (24.5%) and 55 (20.45%)] reported loss of smell and taste sensation as their first symptom. Most common taste sensation lost was salty 191 (71.0%). Loss of smell sensation is seen maximally in mild cases and the difference among mild, moderate and severe cases is statistically significant (p = 0.00001); while the difference in loss of taste among all three grades of severity is statistically insignificant (p = 0.0770). Most of the patients [smell (142; 71%) and taste (198; 73.6%)] recovered after 2 weeks of onset of lost sensations while 96.5% (193/200) and 98.1% (264/269) patients reported complete recovery of smell and taste sensations after two months of onset. Present study shows that high percentage of COVID-19 positive patients develop loss of either one or both of smell and taste sensations but recovery is fast and complete in most of them.","Goyal, Rashmi; Kapoor, Anju; Goyal, Mukesh Kumar; Singh, Rekha",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,130

220389,Trends and Determinants of Mental Health during COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications and Strategies to Overcome the Mental Health Issues-A Rapid Review from 2019-2020,2021,"Most gastric cancer (GC) cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage in China. Because of its high morbidity and mortality, GC remains a major health crisis in China. Surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for GC. Owing to being minimally invasive, laparoscopic radical gastrectomy has been widely used in various countries, especially in East Asia, since Kitano first reported the feasibility and safety of this technique. Although laparoscopic gastric surgery was introduced relatively late in China, Chinese surgeons have made unique contributions to the research and clinical practice of laparoscopic gastric surgery due to the large number of clinical cases. This review focuses on the progress in laparoscopic gastrectomy for advanced stage GC in China, including reasonable approaches in different areas and oncologic efficacy of laparoscopic surgery, and introduce advanced technology to facilitate surgeons to rapidly overcome the learning curve in clinical practice.","Chen, Qi-Yue; Zhong, Qing; Liu, Zhi-Yu; Huang, Xiao-Bo; Que, Si-Jin; Zheng, Wen-Ze; Li, Ping; Zheng, Chao-Hui; Huang, Chang-Ming",Eur. j. surg. oncol,,130

A synchrotron diffraction experiment on a partially detwinned crystal allowed the structure to be solved in the superspace group Imma(00Î³)s00 (No. 74.2). In contrast to some previously published reports, in the pure compound only one distinct phase was observed between Pbam PbZrO3-like antiferroelectric and Pm3m paraelectric phases. The modulation vector depends only slightly on temperature. The major structure modulation is associated with the displacement of lead ions, which is accompanied by a smaller amplitude modulation for the surrounding O atoms and tilting of HfO6 octahedra. Tilting of the octahedra results in a doubling of the unit cell compared with the parent structure.","Bosak, Alexei; Svitlyk, Volodymyr; Arakcheeva, Alla; Burkovsky, Roman; Diadkin, Vadim; Roleder, Krystian; Chernyshov, Dmitry",Acta Crystallogr B Struct Sci Cryst Eng Mater,,130

We aimed to compare the outcomes, the clinical characteristics and the adverse effects of COVID-19 patients to a retrospective cohort of influenza patients.This retrospective case-control study was conducted in the ICUs of Lille and Rouen University Hospitals between January 2014 and May 2020. Two independent cohorts of patients with ARDS requiring V-V ECMO infected with either COVID-19 (n =30) or influenza (n=22) were compared. A 3-month follow-up was completed for all patients.Median age of COVID-19 and influenza patients was similar (57 vs. 55 years; p=0.62). The 28-day mortality rate did not significantly differ between COVID-19 (43.3%) and influenza patients (50%, p=0.63). There was no significant difference considering the cumulative incidence of ECMO weaning, hospital discharge and 3-month survival. COVID-19 patients had a lower SAPS II score (58 [37-64] vs. 68 [52-83]; p=0.039), a higher Body Mass Index (33 [29-38] vs. 30 [26-34] kg/m; p=0.05), and were cannulated later (median delay between mechanical support and V-V ECMO 6 vs. 3 days, p=0.004) compared to influenza patients. No difference in overall adverse events was observed between COVID-19 and influenza patients (70% vs. 95.5% respectively; p=0.23).Despite differences in clinical presentation before V-V ECMO implantation, 28-day and 3-month mortality rate did not differ between COVID-19 and influenza patients. Considering the lack of specific treatment for COVID-19, V-V ECMO should be considered as a relevant rescue organ support.","Cousin, Nicolas; Bourel, Claire; Carpentier, Dorothée; Goutay, Julien; Mugnier, Agnes; Labreuche, Julien; Godeau, Elise; Clavier, Thomas; Grange, Steven; Tamion, Fabienne; Durand, Arthur; Moussa, Mouhamed D; Duburcq, Thibault",ASAIO. j,,130
226209,"Mental Health Care Providers' Attitudes Toward Telepsychiatry: A Systemwide, Multisite Survey During the COVID-19 Pandemic",2021,"At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was able to spread quickly in Wuhan and in the province of Hubei due to a lack of experience with this novel virus. Additionally, authories had no proven experience with applying insufficient medical, communication and crisis management tools. For a considerable period of time, the actual number of people infected was unknown. There were great uncertainties regarding the dynamics and spread of the Covid-19 virus infection. In this paper, we develop a system dynamics model for the three connected regions (Wuhan, Hubei excl. Wuhan, China excl. Hubei) to understand the infection and spread dynamics of the virus and provide a more accurate estimate of the number of infected people in Wuhan and discuss the necessity and effectivity of protective measures against this epidemic, such as the quarantines imposed throughout China. We use the statistics of confirmed cases of China excl. Hubei. Also the daily data on travel activity within China was utilized, in order to determine the actual numerical development of the infected people in Wuhan City and Hubei Province. We used a multivariate Monte Carlo optimization to parameterize the model to match the official statistics. In particular, we used the model to calculate the infections, which had already broken out, but were not diagnosed for various reasons.","Hu, Bo; Dehmer, Matthias; Emmert-Streib, Frank; Zhang, Bo",PLoS One,,130

Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the baseline characteristics of PLWHA aged &#8805; 50years at recruitment to HIV/AIDS clinic compared against the viral load (VL) and CD4 count among patients attending Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital (KTRH), Kenya. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated temporal inclinations of CD4 levels, viral load change and baseline demographic characteristics in the electronic records at the hospital using a mixed error-component model for 1329 PLWHA attending clinic between January 2008 and December 2019. Results: Findings showed a significant difference in the comparison between baseline VL and WHO AIDS staging (p=0.026). Overall VL levels decreased over the period significantly by WHO AIDS staging (p<0.0001). Significant difference was observed by gender (p<0.0001), across age groups (p<0.0001) and baseline CD4 counts (p=0.003). There were significant differences in WHO staging by CD4 count >200cell/mm3 (p=0.048) and residence (p=0.001). Conclusion: Age, WHO AIDS staging, gender and residence are relevant parameters associated with viral load decline and CD4 count in elderly PLWHA.

227262,The evolution and social determinants of mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Luxembourg,2021,"A Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay was used to screen the FDA-approved compound library against the MERS-CoV helicase, an essential enzyme for virus replication within the host cell. Five compounds inhibited the helicase activity with submicromolar potencies (IC50, 0.73-1.65 µM) and ten compounds inhibited the enzyme with micromolar potencies (IC50, 19.6-502 µM). The molecular operating environment (MOE) was used to dock the identified inhibitors on the MERS-CoV helicase nucleotide binding. Strong inhibitors docked well in the nucleotide-binding site and established interactions with some of the essential residues. There was a reasonable correlation between the observed IC50 values and the MOE docking scores of the strong inhibitors (r 2 = 0.74), indicating the ability of the in silico docking model to predict the binding of strong inhibitors. In silico docking could be a useful complementary tool used with the FRET-based assay to predict new MERS-CoV helicase inhibitors. The identified inhibitors could potentially be used in the clinical development of new antiviral treatment for MERS-CoV and other coronavirus related diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Mehyar, N; Mashhour, A; Islam, I; Gul, S; Adedeji, A O; Askar, A S; Boudjelal, M",SAR QSAR Environ Res,,130

Hospitalized patients with AML contributed stool samples to a biorepository protocol that was initiated before COVID-19 and continued without change through the pandemic. Patient-, disease-, and treatment-related characteristics remained the same in the two eras and the only change in clinical care was the implementation of COVID-19 precautions in March 2020. The incidence of all-cause nosocomial infections during the pandemic was lower than in the pre-COVID-19 era.

As the markers of lung injury, the correlation of Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) and fibronectin (Fn) with pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19 was still unclear. METHODS: 113 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 were enrolled in this retrospective study, and divided into three categories as mild, moderate and severe cases. The concentrations of serum KL-6 and Fn at hospital admission were tested using the method of latex agglutination assay and immunoturbidimetic assay, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with that in the non-severe COVID-19 cases and normal control subjects, serum KL-6 concentration on admission was significantly higher in the severe group, which was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, and negatively correlated with lymphocytes count. Whereas, no obvious elevation in serum Fn concentration was investigated in COVID-19 patients with the different phenotypes. The severe cases displayed the higher incident rate of pulmonary fibrosis at hospital discharge. Compared with non-PF patients, the COVID-19 cases with PF had the higher serum KL-6 values. CONCLUSION: Serum KL-6 concentration was significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 patients, which may be useful for evaluating the disease severity. For early prevention of the development of pulmonary fibrosis, high concentrations of serum KL-6 in the early stage of COVID-19 should be paid close attention.","Peng, Ding-Hui; Luo, Yi; Huang, Li-Jun; Liao, Fan-Lu; Liu, Yan-Yuan; Tang, Peng; Hu, Han-Ning; Chen, Wei",Clin Chim Acta,,130
236607,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and initial period of lockdown on the mental health and well-being of adults in the UK,2020,"BACKGROUND: Virtual care has historically faced barriers to widespread adoption. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the rapid adoption and expansion of virtual care technologies. Although the intense and prolonged nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has renewed people's interest in health systems resilience, which includes how services adapt or transform in response to shocks, evidence regarding the role of virtual care technologies in health systems resilience is scarce. OBJECTIVE: At Toronto General Hospital in Ontario, Canada, the rapid virtualization of cardiac care began on March 9, 2020, as a response to the pandemic. The objective of this study was to understand people's experiences with and the barriers and facilitators of the rapid virtualization and expansion of cardiac care resulting from the pandemic. METHODS: A single-case study was conducted with 3 embedded units of analysis. Patients, clinicians, and staff were recruited purposively from an existing mobile, phone-based telemonitoring program at a heart function clinic in Toronto, Canada. Individual, semistructured phone interviews were conducted by two researchers and transcribed verbatim. An inductive thematic analysis at the semantic level was used to analyze transcripts and develop themes. RESULTS: A total of 29 participants were interviewed, including patients (n=16), clinicians (n=9), and staff (n=4). The following five themes were identified: (1) patient safety as a catalyst for virtual care adoption; (2) piecemeal virtual care solutions; (3) confronting new roles and workloads; (4) missing pieces in virtual care; and (5) the inequity paradox. The motivation to protect patient safety and a piecemeal approach to virtual care adoption facilitated the absorptive and adaptive resilience of cardiac care during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, ad hoc changes to clinic roles and workflows, challenges in building relationships through remote methods, and widened inequities were barriers that threatened virtual care sustainment. CONCLUSIONS: We contend that sustaining virtual care hinges upon transformative actions (rather than adaptive actions) that strengthen health systems so that they can face the dynamic and emergent challenges associated with COVID-19 and other shocks. Based on the barriers and facilitators we identified, we present the lessons we learned and recommend transformations for sustaining virtual care during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shah, Amika; Guessi, Milena; Wali, Sahr; Ware, Patrick; McDonald, Michael; O039,; Sullivan, Mary; Posada, Juan Duero; Ross, Heather; Seto, Emily",JMIR Cardio,,130

Therefore, we aimed to analyze the changes in clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients over time. METHODS: We recruited 896 patients who were admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between 30th January 2020 and 16st March 2020. We conducted a retrospective study collecting clinical characteristics, radiologic and laboratory findings, treatments administered, and clinical outcomes in the patients. The data collected were compared between patients with onset of illness in January 2020 and patients with onset of illness in February 2020, in Wuhan, China. Categorical data and non-normally distributed continuous data were examined by the &#967;2 test and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test respectively, and the Kaplan-Meier plot was used to analyze survival data. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. RESULTS: A total of 896 patients were enrolled; the median age was 60 (range, 47-69) years, 685 (76.5%) were categorized into group A (patients with onset of illness in January 2020), and 211 (23.5%) were categorized into group B (patients with onset of illness in February 2020). Compared with group B, group A had a higher incidence of fever (P<0.001), and a lower rate of asymptomatic individuals (P<0.001). Group A patients had a higher incidence of neutrophilia (P=0.043), an elevated D-dimer (P<0.001), and an increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P=0.002), but a lower incidence of a normal computed tomography (CT) scan (P=0.001). CD3 cell counts (P=0.015) and CD4 cell counts (P=0.04) were significantly reduced in group A patients. Critically ill patients were less frequent (P=0.005) and patients with milder disease were more common (P=0.001) in group B. The fatality rate was significantly less in group B patients (P=0.028). Multivariate regression indicated that older age (odds ratio 1.086, 95% CI: 1.061-1.111, per year increase; P<0.001) increased the risk of in-hospital death. Female sex (odds ratio 0.523, 95% CI: 0.316-0.865; P=0.012) and being in group B (odds ratio 0.423, 95% CI: 0.212-0.844; P=0.015) significantly decreased the risk of in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: The condition of patients with onset of illness in January was more serious than that of patients with onset of illness in February 2020. The time of onset of illness was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death comparing January and February 2020. Changing pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and improved healthcare may have contributed to the results, however, more basic research is required to support this hypothesis.","Yang, Ruhao; Wei, Jie; Hu, Weihua; Xiong, Jun; Liu, Menglin; Hu, Ke",Ann Palliat Med,,130

238796,"COVID-19, Mental Health and Aging: A Need for New Knowledge to Bridge Science and Service",2020,"OBJECTIVE: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has prompted one of the most extensive and expeditious genomic sequencing efforts in history. Each viral genome is accompanied by a set of metadata which supplies important information such as the geographic origin of the sample, age of the host, and the lab at which the sample was sequenced, and is integral to epidemiological efforts and public health direction. Here, we interrogate some shortcomings of metadata within the GISAID database to raise awareness of common errors and inconsistencies that may affect data-driven analyses and provide possible avenues for resolutions. RESULTS: Our analysis reveals a startling prevalence of spelling errors and inconsistent naming conventions, which together occur in an estimated ~ 9.8% and ~ 11.6% of ""originating lab"" and ""submitting lab"" GISAID metadata entries respectively. We also find numerous ambiguous entries which provide very little information about the actual source of a sample and could easily associate with multiple sources worldwide. Importantly, all of these issues can impair the ability and accuracy of association studies by deceptively causing a group of samples to identify with multiple sources when they truly all identify with one source, or vice versa.","Gozashti, Landen; Corbett-Detig, Russell",BMC Res Notes,,130
238866,Solitary Anosmia/Ageusia in Prison: Results from a COVID-19 Cluster,2021,"STUDY QUESTION: Does maternal infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in first trimester pregnancy have an impact on the fetal development as measured by nuchal translucency thickness and pregnancy loss? SUMMARY ANSWER: Nuchal translucency thickness at the first trimester scan was not significantly different in pregnant women with versus without SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy and there was no significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first trimester. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Pregnant women are more vulnerable to viral infections. Previous coronavirus epidemics have been associated with increased maternal morbidity, mortality and adverse obstetric outcomes. Currently, no evidence exists regarding possible effects of SARS-CoV-2 in first trimester pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Cohort study of 1019 women with a double test taken between 17 February and 23 April 2020, as a part of the combined first trimester risk assessment, and 36 women with a first trimester pregnancy loss between 14 April and 21 May 2020, prior to the double test. The study period was during the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave in Denmark. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Cohort 1 included pregnant women with a double test taken within the study period. The excess serum from each double test was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Results were correlated to the nuchal translucency thickness and the number of pregnancy losses before or at the time of the first trimester scan. Cohort 2 included women with a pregnancy loss before the gestational age for double test sample. Serum from a blood test taken the day the pregnancy loss was identified was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The study was conducted at a public university hospital serving â¼12% of pregnant women and births in Denmark. All participants in the study provided written informed consent. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Eighteen (1.8%) women had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum from the double test suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy. There was no significant difference in nuchal translucency thickness for women testing positive for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 16) versus negative (n = 966) (P = 0.62). There was no significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss for women with antibodies (n = 1) (OR 3.4, 0.08-24.3 95% CI, P = 0.27). None of the women had been hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. None of the women with pregnancy loss prior to the double test (Cohort 2) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: These results may only apply to similar populations and to patients who do not require hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A limitation of the study is that only 1.8% of the study population had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies suggestive of previous infection. WIDER IMPLICATION OF THE FINDINGS: Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection had no effect on the nuchal translucency thickness and there was no significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss for women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in first trimester pregnancy. Evidence concerning COVID-19 in pregnancy is still limited. These data indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 in not hospitalized women does not pose a significant threat in first trimester pregnancies. Follow-up studies are needed to establish any risk to a fetus exposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection.

238990,Primary health and care,2020,"Meteorological parameters are important factors that have an influence on infectious diseases. The present study aimed to explore the correlation between the spread of COVID-19, temperature, and relative humidity. The effect of human-imposed control parameters in the form of lockdown on the dissipation of COVID-19 was also analysed. Data were collected on the three study variables - temperature, relative humidity, and lockdown period - from nine of the most infected cities worldwide as well as information on changes in the number of COVID-19 patients from the beginning to a specific point in the lockdown period. A generalised regression model was applied to explore the effect of temperature and relative humidity on the change in daily new cases of COVID-19. The regression analysis did not find any significant correlation between temperature, humidity, and change in number of COVID-19 cases. Analysis of the cities with wide-ranging temperature variations showed a negative correlation of COVID-19 transmission (P=0.079) with temperature, but a relatively non-significant correlation with relative humidity (P=0.198). The number of total deaths was also higher in low-temperature countries compared with high-temperature countries. The specific growth rate in COVID-19 cases was decreased by more than 66% after implementation of a lockdown. This growth rate was exponentially decreased over time through the proper implementation of lockdown. Analysis of the real-case scenario and application of predictive models showed that for New York, Lombardy, and Madrid more than 120 days of strict lockdown was required for complete control of the transmission of COVID-19.","Mozumder, M S I; Amin, M S A; Uddin, M R; Talukder, M J",Arch Pediatr,,130

We develop a theory and hypotheses about the impact of citizens' experiences on their perceptions of the government's effectiveness during times of crisis. We do so with data collected at two points in time: in late March 2020 during the first peak of the Covid-19 crisis in Israel, and in October 2020 when Israel was exiting from a second lockdown. The findings demonstrate that during crises citizens focus on the short term and seek immediate results in terms of readiness and preparedness. During such times, the government's responsiveness and transparency, as well as the public's participation in decisions, seem even more important than their trust in the government.

The current global statistics for the disease are 111 million cases and 2.45 million deaths, with new cases emerging each day. Although several drugs including remdesivir have been approved for emergency use, they remain ineffective in bringing the infection under control. Therefore, there is a need for highly effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. The recent advancements in mRNA vaccines have catapulted them to be forefront in the race to develop vaccines for COVID-19. Two mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics, respectively, have been granted authorization for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration. Interim analysis of the clinical trials for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines reported an efficacy of 95% and 94.1%, respectively, after the second dose. The adverse events for both the vaccines have been found to be mild to moderate, with mostly injection-site reactions and fatigue. No serious adverse events have been reported. Moreover, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics have announced that their vaccines are effective even against the new strains (B.1.17 and B.1.351) of the virus. Both companies are now scaling up the production of the vaccines to meet the global demand. Although the long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of these vaccines is uncertain, there is hope that they can turn the tables against COVID-19 in this current pandemic situation.","Deva Priya, Sagili Anthony; Kavitha, Shivakumar; Venugopal, Priyanka; Sriram, Damal Kandadai; George, Melvin",Clin. drug investg,,130

240227,Pharmacological treatment during CoViD-19 and mental health issues,2021,"BACKGROUND: The goal of this systematic review is to assess the published literature for seizure risk with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine therapy in persons with and without epilepsy. With the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a desperate need for treatment against the SARS CoV-2 virus. Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is one proposed medication that has received substantial public attention. However, the package insert states that these medications may provoke seizures in patients with epilepsy, and this has resulted in increased questions and anxiety in the epilepsy community. METHODS: PubMed (1970 to March 27, 2020) and the Embase (1970 to March 27, 2020) were searched with the terms chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine and seizure or epilepsy, convulsions, or status epilepticus. Selected studies were reviewed, and the adverse drug reaction was classified. RESULTS: Only eleven out of 31 studies were deemed eligible for systematic analysis. For chloroquine, eligible studies were- one prospective study(n = 109), two case series(n = 6), and six case reports. The dose of chloroquine ranged between 100-500 mg/day, except in one patient with a seizure, who was after taking 1000 mg. For hydroxychloroquine, there was one prospective observational study(n = 631) and one case report. The clinical trials failed to find any significant relation between seizures and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSION: Although the package insert describes an increased risk of seizure, the systematic review highlights that such a statement is not supported by class I evidence. Clinicians, therefore, need to understand that data regarding this specific topic is limited to case series and case reports. There is no substantial evidence to suggest that these medications can increase seizure risk.","Pati, Sandipan; Houston, Thomas",Epilepsy Res,,130

Questionnaire topics were: (i) demographic and socio-economic characteristics; (ii) level of burden caused by common causes of COVID-19 related concerns; (iii) strategies used in response to concerns about COVID-19; and (iv) symptoms of mental disorders of anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), PTSD (ITQ) and adjustment disorder (ADNM8). Descriptive and multivariate analyses were conducted. RESULTS: There were 2088 respondents. High levels of symptoms for mental disorders were observed for anxiety (23.9% women, 21.0% men), depression (30.3% women, 25.27% men), PTSD (11.8% women, and 12.5% men), and adjustment disorder (40.7% women, 31.0% men). Factors significantly associated with increased COVID-19 concern included bad/very bad household economic situation, larger household size, current NCD, symptoms of anxiety, adjustment disorder and PTSD. Response strategies significantly associated with reduced mental disorder symptoms included meditation and relaxation exercises, physical exercise, positive thinking, planning for the future, TV/radio, housework/DIY, and working. Drinking alcohol was associated with a greater probability of increased mental disorder symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of mental disorders were recorded, and they were strongly associated with increased concern about COVID-19. A number of response strategies were identified which may help protect against worse mental health and these could be supported by innovations in mental health care in Georgia.","Makhashvili, Nino; Javakhishvili, Jana Darejan; Sturua, Lela; Pilauri, Ketevan; Fuhr, Daniela C; Roberts, Bayard",Global Health,,130

249205,Implementing an emotional support and mental health response plan for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents a global challenge for managing acutely ill patients and complications from viral infection. Systemic inflammation accompanied by a ""cytokine storm,"" hemostasis alterations and severe vasculitis have all been reported to occur with COVID-19, and emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of lipid transport may contribute to some of these complications. Here, we aim to summarize the current understanding of the potential mechanisms related to COVID-19 dyslipidemia and propose possible adjunctive type therapeutic approaches that modulate lipids and lipoproteins. Specifically, we hypothesize that changes in the quantity and composition of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) that occurs with COVID-19 can significantly decrease the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative functions of HDL and could contribute to pulmonary inflammation. Furthermore, we propose that lipoproteins with oxidized phospholipids and fatty acids could lead to virus-associated organ damage via overactivation of innate immune scavenger receptors. Restoring lipoprotein function with ApoA-I raising agents or blocking relevant scavenger receptors with neutralizing antibodies could, therefore, be of value in the treatment of COVID-19. Finally, we discuss the role of omega-3 fatty acids transported by lipoproteins in generating specialized proresolving mediators and how together with anti-inflammatory drugs, they could decrease inflammation and thrombotic complications associated with COVID-19.","Sorokin, Alexander V; Karathanasis, Sotirios K; Yang, Zhi-Hong; Freeman, Lita; Kotani, Kazuhiko; Remaley, Alan T",FASEB j,,130

251573,Scalability of Telemedicine Services in a Large Integrated Multispecialty Health Care System During COVID-19,2020,"The CUREing Ocean Plastic? project, an NSF-funded initiative addressing microbial colonization of ocean plastic, is a collaboration between a private non-profit university serving non-traditional students (National University, NU) and a world-renowned research-oriented institution (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, SIO). Over two years it has consistently shown significant gains in student knowledge of scientific research, laboratory techniques, and appreciation of science. In 2020, the SARS-Covid-19 pandemic effectively stopped in-person classes and field trips to SIO. The goal of this study was to 1) adapt content to online delivery, and 2) test the hypothesis that an online experience would result in comparable increases in student engagement and knowledge. In our original design, students in onsite classes were shown a documentary describing the background to the project, assessed by a low-stakes quiz. The day of the field trip, students visited the SIO pier and observed sample deployment and collection. Presentations addressed the research project, its experimental design, and updates about current ocean plastic research, culminating in a Q&A session with NU and SIO researchers and students. Afterward, students in the lab analyzed the collected plastic samples according to the course, from simple colony observations to DNA extraction, 16S PCR, and blast analysis. Introductory biology lab courses were selected for the online pilot. We developed video content of lectures presented during the field trip experience and footage of deployment and collection of samples. The material was scaffolded over 3 weeks of the course. At the end of the third, students participated in a live Zoom session with NU and SIO scientists and research students. The panel answered questions about the project, science skills and careers, the state of plastic pollution, and possible solutions. The intervention was assessed via retrospective surveys and focus groups. Survey results of the online students (N=24) were compared to those of previous onsite students (N=83) using paired and unpaired t-tests with Bonferroni corrections. For both groups, the ?after? scores were significantly higher for all questions than the ?before? scores, as students rated their knowledge of scientific design, basic laboratory techniques, SIO and NU research, and ocean plastic research. Interestingly, the ?before? scores of online students were significantly lower compared to the onsite students, but there was no significant difference was found in the ?after? scores. Focus group interviews of nine students reflected a deep appreciation of both the experience and the knowledge gained regarding the real-life relevance of plastic pollution. The results show that carefully designed virtual experiences can substitute in-person science experiences with comparable effect on student engagement and perception of knowledge. While limited in the hands-on and informal social aspects, the virtual field trip is an accessible alternative that can reach larger student audiences.","Barral, Ana Maria Simmons Rachel DeForce Emelia Bowman Jeff",The FASEB Journal,,130

253018,The impact of quarantine and physical distancing following covid-19 on mental health: Study protocol of a multicentric italian population trial,2020,"BACKGROUND: Quarantine is considered as an effective solution in the early stages of an epidemic. In the case of the coronavirus epidemic, quarantine was also recommended and implemented as a significant guideline to prevent the disease. However, despite the benefits of quarantine, there are also complications and problems. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate the health effects of quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study was conducted as a literature review through searching the databases Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct for papers published before July 2020. The research was conducted based on the keywords ""Coronavirus,"" ""COVID-19,"" and ""quarantine."" The references of the papers were also reviewed to find the ones not found in the databases. The guidelines published by reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were used in this study. RESULTS: Although quarantine is applied as an important and primary solution in the outbreak of epidemics, in cases of pandemics, it may not be free of negative effects on individuals and public health. However, because of the need to reopen and restart social and economic activities, some changes should be made in lifestyles and work activities. Using cyberspace and telework can be helpful. As the findings showed, COVID-19 bubbles can be used to restore social communications. CONCLUSION: Using masks, avoiding unnecessary gatherings, complying with personal and social hygiene, and respecting social distancing can be valuable solutions that, if implemented properly, can decrease the rate of the disease significantly. It is also emphasized that quarantine is still necessary and important as the best solution for sick people and individuals who are suspected carriers of the disease.","Feiz Arefi, Maryam; Babaei-Pouya, Amin; Poursadeqiyan, Mohsen",Work,,130

There is an urgent need, therefore, to find a proper treatment for the novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent. This paper focuses on identifying inhibitors that target SARS-CoV-2 proteases, PLPRO and 3CLPRO, which control the duplication and manages the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. We have carried out detailed in silico Virtual high-throughput screening using Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs from the Zinc database, COVID-19 clinical trial compounds from Pubchem database, Natural compounds from Natural Product Activity and Species Source (NPASS) database and Maybridge database against PLPRO and 3CLPRO proteases. After thoroughly analyzing the screening results, we found five compounds, Bemcentinib, Pacritinib, Ergotamine, MFCD00832476, and MFCD02180753 inhibit PLPRO and six compounds, Bemcentinib, Clofazimine, Abivertinib, Dasabuvir, MFCD00832476, Leuconicine F inhibit the 3CLPRO. These compounds are stable within the protease proteins' active sites at 20ns MD simulation. The stability is revealed by hydrogen bond formations, hydrophobic interactions, and salt bridge interactions. Our study results also reveal that the selected five compounds against PLPRO and the six compounds against 3CLPRO bind to their active sites with good binding free energy. These compounds that inhibit the activity of PLPRO and 3CLPRO may, therefore, be used for treating COVID-19 infection.","Jade, Dhananjay; Ayyamperumal, Selvaraj; Tallapaneni, Vyshnavi; Joghee Nanjan, Chandrasekar Moola; Barge, Sagar; Mohan, Surender; Nanjan, Moola Joghee",Eur J Pharmacol,,130
254089,Creating a compassion system to achieve efficiency and quality in health care delivery,2021,"Immune response dynamics in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their severe manifestations have largely been studied in circulation. Here, we examined the relationship between immune processes in the respiratory tract and circulation through longitudinal phenotypic, transcriptomic, and cytokine profiling of paired airway and blood samples from patients with severe COVID-19 relative to heathy controls. In COVID-19 airways, T cells exhibited activated, tissue-resident, and protective profiles; higher T cell frequencies correlated with survival and younger age. Myeloid cells in COVID-19 airways featured hyperinflammatory signatures, and higher frequencies of these cells correlated with mortality and older age. In COVID-19 blood, aberrant CD163+ monocytes predominated over conventional monocytes, and were found in corresponding airway samples and in damaged alveoli. High levels of myeloid chemoattractants in airways suggest recruitment of these cells through a CCL2-CCR2 chemokine axis. Our findings provide insights into immune processes driving COVID-19 lung pathology with therapeutic implications for targeting inflammation in the respiratory tract.","Szabo, Peter A; Dogra, Pranay; Gray, Joshua I; Wells, Steven B; Connors, Thomas J; Weisberg, Stuart P; Krupska, Izabela; Matsumoto, Rei; Poon, Maya M L; Idzikowski, Emma; Morris, Sinead E; Pasin, Chloé; Yates, Andrew J; Ku, Amy; Chait, Michael; Davis-Porada, Julia; Guo, Xinzheng V; Zhou, Jing; Steinle, Matthew; Mackay, Sean; Saqi, Anjali; Baldwin, Matthew R; Sims, Peter A; Farber, Donna L",Immunity,,130
255214,What does COVID mean for UK mental health care?,2020,"Singapore is one of the most densely populated small island-states in the world. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Singapore implemented large-scale institutional isolation units called Community Care Facilities (CCFs) to combat the outbreak in the community by housing low-risk COVID-19 patients from April to August 2020. The CCFs were created rapidly by converting existing public spaces and used a protocolized system, augmented by telemedicine to enable a low health care worker-patient ratio (98 health care workers for 3200 beds), to operate these unique facilities. In the first month, a total of 3758 patients were admitted to 4 halls, 4929 in-house medical consults occurred, 136 patients were transferred to a hospital, 1 patient died 2 weeks after discharge, and no health care workers became infected. This article shares the authors' experience in operating these massive-scale isolation facilities while prioritizing safety for all and ensuring holistic patient care in the face of a public health crisis and lean health care resources.","Chia, Ming Li; Him Chau, Dickson Hong; Lim, Kheng Sit; Yang Liu, Christopher Wei; Tan, Hiang Khoon; Tan, Yan Ru",Ann. intern. med,,130

Nos casos crônicos, pode haver a formação de condroides, que dificultam o tratamento clínico, podendo a cirurgia ser indicada. Com a evolução da vídeo cirurgia e o desenvolvimento de instrumentais as técnicas de abordagem das bolsas guturais tem sido modificadas. Este trabalho tem por objetivo determinar o acesso as bolsas guturais pela faringe, por via endoscópica, além de desenvolver um dispositivo que facilite o procedimento cirúrgico. Foram utilizados cinco equinos, sem raça definida, com idade entre 03 a 15 anos, sem alterações clínicas ou das vias aéreas detectadas ao exame endoscópico. Os animais foram sedados e permaneceram em estação contidos no tronco. Foi realizada a sondagem e coleta de material das bolsas guturais. Com o auxílio de um dispositivo de cauterização monopolar desenhado para este procedimento realizou a fenestração entre o recesso faríngeo e à laringe. As fístulas formadas tiveram inicialmente formato de elipse e foram acompanhadas semanalmente até completar 35 dias de pós-operatório. Os resultados mostraram que quanto mais dorsal a fístula melhor a perviedade da mesma. O dispositivo desenvolvido permitiu um procedimento rápido e de fácil execução com o equino em estação, além de um baixo custo, podendo ser acoplado a qualquer cautério monopolar. Os exames microbiológicos mostraram total alteração de flora bacteriana da bolsa gutural em todos os animais. Portanto sugerimos novos estudos em animais acometidos de empiemas crônicos e recidivantes das bolsas guturais, para verificar a eficácia clinica desta técnica de faringosalpingostomia.","TEIXEIRA, WILLIAM TIMBONI",,,130

We compared COVID-19 worry, attitudes towards governmental responses, and self-reported mental health symptoms among adults aged &#8805;55 in the United States and Canada early in the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Online cross-sectional survey administered between April 2nd and May 31st in the United States and between May 1st and June 30th, 2020 in Canada. SETTING: Nationally in the United States and Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of older adults aged &#8805;55. MEASUREMENTS: Likert-type scales measured COVID-19 worry and attitudes towards government support. Three standardized scales assessed mental health symptoms: the eight-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the five-item Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the three-item UCLA loneliness scale. RESULTS: There were 4453 U.S. respondents (71.7% women; mean age 67.5) and 1549 Canadian (67.6% women; mean age 69.3). More U.S. respondents (71%) were moderately or extremely worried about the pandemic, compared to 52% in Canada. Just 20% of U.S. respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the federal government cared about older adults in their COVID-19 pandemic response, compared to nearly two-thirds of Canadians (63%). U.S. respondents were more likely to report elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to Canadians; 34.2% (32.8-35.6) versus 25.6% (23.3-27.8) for depressive and 30.8% (29.5-32.2) versus 23.7% (21.6-25.9) for anxiety symptoms. The proportion of United States and Canadian respondents who reported loneliness was similar. A greater proportion of women compared to men reported symptoms of depression and anxiety across all age groups in both countries. CONCLUSION: U.S. older adults felt less supported by their federal government and had elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to older adults in Canada during early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health messaging from governments should be clear, consistent, and incorporate support for mental health.","Reppas-Rindlisbacher, Christina; Finlay, Jessica M; Mahar, Alyson L; Siddhpuria, Shailee; Hallet, Julie; Rochon, Paula A; Kobayashi, Lindsay C",J Am Geriatr Soc,,130

The current knowledge about pregnancy, labor and the first days of life is characterized by particular uncertainty due to the scarce data available. However, there is currently no evidence of significant unfavorable maternal and perinatal outcome. Many pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection remain asymptomatic. The possibility of vertical transmission to the child cannot be excluded with certainty. However, indications of vertical transmission were detected only in individual cases. Newborn infections are also rather rare, unspecific and usually mild, with respiratory symptoms dominating.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the implementation of an IV levothyroxine hold guideline. METHODS: This single-center, retrospective analysis identified patients ordered for IV levothyroxine during a 13-week period before and after implementation of the guideline. The primary outcome was guideline adherence, defined as full implementation of the 3-day hold. Secondary outcomes included the number of IV levothyroxine administrations avoided in the post-guideline group, extrapolated yearly cost avoidance (EYCA) after guideline implementation, reasons for guideline non-adherence, and number of safety reports involving IV levothyroxine. RESULTS: A total of 166 and 134 patients met inclusion criteria for the pre- and post-guideline groups, respectively. Guideline adherence was observed in 94 (70.1%) patients, resulting in 276 vials saved in the 13-week post-guideline period, which translated to an EYCA of $139,877. Forty orders (29.9%) were non-adherent to the guideline, with the most common reason stated as nil per os (NPO). No difference in safety outcomes was seen between the pre- and post-guideline groups, as evidenced by 1 safety report in each group. CONCLUSION: We observed a high rate of adherence to an IV levothyroxine hold guideline. This was associated with a substantial cost savings over the study period with no increase in reported safety events. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of an inpatient IV levothyroxine 3-day hold guideline.","Marino, Kaylee K; Crowley, Kaitlin E; Tran, Lena K; Sylvia, Daniel; Dell039,; Orfano, Heather; DeGrado, Jeremy R; Szumita, Paul M",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,130

265097,Intolerance of Uncertainty and Mental Wellbeing: Serial Mediation by Rumination and Fear of COVID-19,2020,"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to quantitatively measure the global health situation and/or governments’ reaction vis-à-vis the pandemic have flourished. In spite of the significance of data in the fight against the pandemic, however, such global knowledge is largely questionable, insofar as it exposes itself to the many hazards and fallacies associated with global attempts to frame the social world in numbers. This is why the paper attempts to identify the hazards and fallacies most commonly associated with global measurements of social phenomena and to verify whether and to what extent these hazards and fallacies affect numerical representations of the pandemic and its effects. To this end, the paper analyses ten English-language global numerical initiatives that were launched between January and May 2020, and reviews them in light of existing critical literature on global numbers. The aim is to provide a deeper understanding of global measurements of health and related law-and-policy measures, and to suggest caution about their use as a basis for knowledge and action in the context of the pandemic.","Infantino, Marta",International Journal of Law in Context,,130

Descriptive and preliminary data",2021,"BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, adherence to suggested precautionary measures has been emphasized as important in preventing and curtailing its spread. However, strict adherence to precautionary measures can be demanding. METHODS: This cluster randomised controlled trial done among 1517 undergraduate dental students tested the effectiveness of 'dissonance induction' (DI) and 'assessment reactivity' (AR) in improving adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) measures as compared to a control group. At baseline, participants in the DI group were tested for their knowledge of precautionary measures, immediately followed by assessment of their adherence to them. This methodology was adapted to systematically reveal the poor adherence of the participants in their self-held cognitions, should there be any. The magnitude of dissonance was measured as the proportion of such dissonant cognitions held by an individual. In the AR group, at baseline, participants were asked about their attitudes alone toward measures. The control group was neither assessed for knowledge and adherence nor for attitudes toward the measures at baseline. Two weeks after the administration of these interventions in the DI and AR groups, the 3 study groups were assessed for adherence. RESULTS: The follow-up adherence scores in the DI group were found to be significantly higher (15.11 ± 4.1) compared to the AR (13.13 ± 2.01) and control (12.87 ± 2.97) groups as analysed by Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (Hâ¯=â¯243.5; P < .001). Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that the adherence scores significantly improved in the DI group from baseline to follow-up (zâ¯=â¯-8.84; P < .001). Magnitude of dissonance at baseline was found to be a significant predictor of follow-up adherence scores (R2â¯=â¯0.255). CONCLUSION: This study found that DI is an easy intervention to bring an immediate and significant change in adherence to precautionary measures.","Chandu, Viswa Chaitanya; Lingamaneni, Krishna Prasad; Pachava, Srinivas; Baddam, Venkat Ramana Reddy; Marella, Yamuna",Int. dent. j,,130

267780,Language and Health Equity during COVID-19: Lessons and Opportunities,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pandemic fatigue is an emerging health concern among frontline clinical nurses as a consequence of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the various measures implemented to slow the spread of infection. As yet, no studies have investigated the link between pandemic fatigue and resilience, mental health, sleep quality and job contentment in frontline clinical nurses. AIM: This study examined the influence of pandemic fatigue on clinical nurses' mental health, sleep quality and job contentment, with resilience as a mediator. METHODS: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study involving 255 frontline clinical nurses in the Philippines. The Pandemic Fatigue Questionnaire, Brief Resilience Scale, Job Contentment Scale, and the Sleep Quality Scale were used to collect data through an online survey. RESULTS: The mean pandemic fatigue score was 3.086 (out of 5). Being vaccinated (ß = 0.231, p < 0.001) and increased staffing levels (ß = -0.488, p < 0.01) were associated with decreased pandemic fatigue in clinical nurses. Resilience partially mediated the relationships between (a) pandemic fatigue and mental health (ß = -0.488, p < 0.001), (b) pandemic fatigue and sleep quality (ß = -0.326, p < 0.001) and (c) pandemic fatigue and job contentment (ß = -0.395, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Clinical nurses who received a COVID-19 vaccine and those who perceived sufficient staffing in their units reported lower levels of pandemic fatigue. Resilience reduces the effects of pandemic fatigue on clinical nurses' mental health, sleep quality and job contentment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: By providing frontline nurses with access to COVID-19 vaccines and ensuring a sufficient staffing levels, nurse managers could effectively reduce or prevent pandemic fatigue and improve their mental health. Implementing resilience-promoting measures are essential to support nurses' mental health, promote their sleep quality and foster job satisfaction.","Labrague, Leodoro J",J. nurs. manag,,130
268762,Detecting the Relationship between the Stress Levels and Perceived Burnout in Law-enforcement Officers during the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cross-sectional Study,2021,"The continual spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), posing a severe threat to the health worldwide. The main protease (Mpro, alias 3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial enzyme for the maturation of viral particles and is a very attractive target for designing drugs to treat COVID-19. Here, we propose a multiple conformation-based virtual screening strategy to discover inhibitors that can target SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Based on this strategy, nine Mpro structures and a protein mimetics library with 8960 commercially available compounds were prepared to carry out ensemble docking for the first time. Five of the nine structures are apo forms presented in different conformations, whereas the other four structures are holo forms complexed with different ligands. The surface plasmon resonance assay revealed that 6 out of 49 compounds had the ability to bind to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiment showed that the biochemical half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of the six compounds could hamper Mpro activities ranged from 0.69 ± 0.05 to 2.05 ± 0.92 µM. Evaluation of antiviral activity using the cell-based assay indicated that two compounds (Z1244904919 and Z1759961356) could strongly inhibit the cytopathic effect and reduce replication of the living virus in Vero E6 cells with the half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) of 4.98 ± 1.83 and 8.52 ± 0.92 µM, respectively. The mechanism of the action for the two inhibitors were further elucidated at the molecular level by molecular dynamics simulation and subsequent binding free energy analysis. As a result, the discovered noncovalent reversible inhibitors with novel scaffolds are promising antiviral drug candidates, which may be used to develop the treatment of COVID-19.","Yang, Jingyi; Lin, Xiaoyuan; Xing, Na; Zhang, Zhao; Zhang, Haiwei; Wu, Haibo; Xue, Weiwei",J Chem Inf Model,,130
270238,"Children on the brink: Risks for child protection, sexual abuse, and related mental health problems in the COVID-19 pandemic",2020,"Accurate and trustworthy epidemic forecasting is an important problem that has impact on public health planning and disease mitigation. Most existing epidemic forecasting models disregard uncertainty quantification, resulting in mis-calibrated predictions. Recent works in deep neural models for uncertainty-aware time-series forecasting also have several limitations; e.g. it is difficult to specify meaningful priors in Bayesian NNs, while methods like deep ensembling are computationally expensive in practice. In this paper, we fill this important gap. We model the forecasting task as a probabilistic generative process and propose a functional neural process model called EPIFNP, which directly models the probability density of the forecast value. EPIFNP leverages a dynamic stochastic correlation graph to model the correlations between sequences in a non-parametric way, and designs different stochastic latent variables to capture functional uncertainty from different perspectives. Our extensive experiments in a real-time flu forecasting setting show that EPIFNP significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and calibration metrics, up to 2.5x in accuracy and 2.4x in calibration. Additionally, due to properties of its generative process,EPIFNP learns the relations between the current season and similar patterns of historical seasons,enabling interpretable forecasts. Beyond epidemic forecasting, the EPIFNP can be of independent interest for advancing principled uncertainty quantification in deep sequential models for predictive analytics","Kamarthi, Harshavardhan; Kong, Lingkai; Rodr'iguez, Alexander; Zhang, Chao; Prakash, B.

270467,"Joint MH, COVID-19 campaign offers critical resources",2021,"Osteosarcoma is a genomically complex disease characterized by few recurrent single-nucleotide mutations or in-frame fusions. In contrast, structural alterations, including copy number changes, chromothripsis, kataegis, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and other large-scale genomic alterations, are frequent and widespread across the osteosarcoma genome. These observed structural alterations lead to activation of oncogenes and loss of tumor suppressors which together contribute to oncogenesis. To date, few targeted therapies for osteosarcoma have been identified. It is likely that effectiveness of targeted therapies will vary greatly in subsets of tumors with distinct key driver events. Model systems which can recapitulate the genetic heterogeneity of this disease are needed to test this hypothesis. One possible approach is to use patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models characterized with regards to their similarity to the human tumor samples from which they were derived. Here we review evidence pointing to the genomic complexity of osteosarcoma and how this is reflected in available model systems. We also review the current state of preclinical testing for targeted therapies using these models.","Schott, Courtney; Shah, Avanthi Tayi; Sweet-Cordero, E Alejandro",Adv Exp Med Biol,,130

Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), which was recently identified in piglets in southern China, is an alphacoronavirus that originates from the same genus of horseshoe bats as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and that was reported to be capable of infecting cells from a broad range of species, suggesting a considerable potential for interspecies transmission. Given the importance of the coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein in host range determination and viral entry, we report a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the SADS-CoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation at a 3.55-Å resolution. Our structure reveals that the SADS-CoV S trimer assumes an intrasubunit quaternary packing mode in which the S1 subunit N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and the S1 subunit C-terminal domain (S1-CTD) of the same protomer pack together by facing each other in the lying-down state. SADS-CoV S has several distinctive structural features that may facilitate immune escape, such as a relatively compact architecture of the S trimer and epitope masking by glycan shielding. Comparison of SADS-CoV S with the spike proteins of the other coronavirus genera suggested that the structural features of SADS-CoV S are evolutionarily related to those of the spike proteins of the other genera rather than to the spike protein of a typical alphacoronavirus. These data provide new insights into the evolutionary relationship between spike glycoproteins of SADS-CoV and those of other coronaviruses and extend our understanding of their structural and functional diversity.IMPORTANCE In this article, we report the atomic-resolution prefusion structure of the spike protein from swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). SADS-CoV is a pathogenic alphacoronavirus that was responsible for a large-scale outbreak of fatal disease in pigs and that was reported to be capable of interspecies transmission. We describe the overall structure of the SADS-CoV spike protein and conducted a detailed analysis of its main structural elements. Our results and analyses are consistent with those of previous phylogenetic studies and suggest that the SADS-CoV spike protein is evolutionarily related to the spike proteins of betacoronaviruses, with a strong similarity in S1-NTDs and a marked divergence in S1-CTDs. Moreover, we discuss the possible immune evasion strategies used by the SADS-CoV spike protein. Our study provides insights into the structure and immune evasion strategies of the SADS-CoV spike protein and broadens the understanding of the evolutionary relationships between coronavirus spike proteins of different genera.","Guan, Hongxin; Wang, Youwang; Perculija, Vanja; Saeed, Abdullah F U H; Liu, Yichang; Li, Jinyu; Jan, Syed Sajid; Li, Yu; Zhu, Ping; Ouyang, Songying",J. virol,,130

Our objective was to evaluate the difference in D-dimer values of subjects infected with COVID-19 in those with PE and those without and to analyze the predictive value of D-dimer for PE in these subjects based on the day of D-dimer determination. This was an observational, retrospective study, conducted at a tertiary hospital. All subjects with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection requiring hospital admission at our institution between the months of March and April 2020 were included in the study. We compared D-dimer levels in subjects who went on to develop a PE and those who did not. We then created a model to predict the subsequent development of a PE with the current D-dimer levels of the subject. D-dimer levels changed over time from COVID-19 diagnosis, but were always higher in subjects who went on to develop a PE. Regarding the predictive model created, the area under the curve of the ROC analyses of the cross-validation predictions was 0.72. The risk of pulmonary embolism for the same D-dimer levels varied depending on the number of days elapsed since COVID-19 diagnosis and D-dimer determination. To conclude, D-dimer levels were elevated in subjects with a COVID-19 infection, especially in those with PE. D-dimer levels increased during the first 10 days after the diagnosis of the infection and can be used to predict the risk of PE in COVID-19 subjects.","Garcia-Olivé, Ignasi; Sintes, Helena; Radua, Joaquim; Deportos, Jordi; Nogueira, Isabel; Morales-Indiano, Cristian; Abad Capa, Jorge; Rosell, Antoni",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,130

This basic qualitative research was carried out with a study group of 24 early childhood educators, all of whom were determined via a maximum variation sampling method. The study data were gathered via interviews conducted with the participants and analyzed through an inductive approach. The study findings showed that early childhood educators need to improve their technological competencies, have more interactive resources at their disposal, be able to take advantage of a user-friendly educational platform specifically designed for the early childhood period, be provided with the resources to serve families, and have support for their psychological well-being. Considering the essential role of teachers, which the COVID-19 pandemic has called to mind, it is of vital importance to meet the abovementioned needs so as to improve the quality of distance education in early childhood.","Alan, Ümran",Early Child Educ J,,130

Thus, the importance of logistics and supply chain functions has been amplified in almost every business that ships physical goods. In Vietnam, the logistics service sector has seen rapid expansion. Since more and more businesses are seeking third-party logistics (3PL) providers to outsource the logistics functions, this article aims to offer decision-makers an integrated and consistent model for evaluating and selecting the most efficient 3PLs. To this end, the authors exploit a hybrid multi-criteria method which is fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy vlsekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno resenje (FVIKOR) while examining the most influential and conflicting criteria regarding economic, service level, environmental, social, and risk aspects. Fuzzy information in the natural decision-making process is considered, linguistic variables are used to mitigate the uncertain levels in the criteria weights. First, FAHP (the weighting method) is adopted to evaluate and calculate each criterion’s relative significant fuzzy weight. FVIKOR (the compromised ranking method) is then used to rank the alternatives. The combination of FAHP and FVIKOR methods provides more accurate ranking results. As a result, reliability and delivery time, voice of customer, logistics cost, network management, and quality of service are the most impactful factors to the logistics outsourcing problem. Eventually, the optimized 3PLs were determined that fully meet the criteria of sustainable development. The developed integrated model offers the complete and robust 3PLs evaluation and selection process and can also be a powerful decision support tool for other industries. © 2021 by the authors.

Due to its high transmissibility, this virus quickly spread throughout the world, causing considerable health issues. The scientific community exerted noteworthy efforts to obtain therapeutic solutions for COVID-19, and new scientific networks were constituted. No certified drugs to efficiently inhibit the virus were identified, and the development of de-novo medicines requires approximately ten years of research. Therefore, the repurposing of natural products could be an effective strategy to handle SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review aims to update on current status of the natural occurring compounds recognizing SARS-CoV-2 druggable targets. Among the clinical trials actually recruited, some natural compounds are ongoing to examine their potential role to prevent and to treat the COVID-19 infection. Many natural scaffolds, including alkaloids, terpenes, flavonoids, and benzoquinones, were investigated by in-silico, in-vitro, and in-vivo approaches. Despite the large data set obtained by a computational approach, experimental evidences in most cases are not available. To fill this gap, further efforts to validate these results are required. We believe that an accurate investigation of naturally occurring compounds may provide insights for the potential treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Romeo, Isabella; Mesiti, Francesco; Lupia, Antonio; Alcaro, Stefano",Molecules (Basel),,130

Recent fieldwork during the peak of the global Covid-19 epidemic served as a trigger for this observation. Their self-confidence in the robustness of their lifestyle and their embeddedness within their natural environment is so strong that Yamal-Nenets nomads believe only evil forces – not nature – can stop them from being mobile. Alongside Covid-19, they interpret the severe consequences of natural disasters, such as iced pastures, related reindeer starvation and the outbreak of anthrax as man-made attempts to reduce the number of people and animals in the tundra. The blame they place on humans for these disasters takes place in the context of hitherto unseen gas industry developments in the area.

The clinical complexities (inflammation, cytokine storm, and multi-organ dysfunction) associated with COVID-19 poses constraints to effective management of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) has been evaluated as a potential therapeutic modality for COVID-19 pneumonia. However, due to heterogeneity in disease manifestation and inter-individual variations, effective planning for LDRT is limited for this large-scale event. 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) has emerged as a polypharmacological agent for COVID-19 treatment due to its effects on the glycolytic pathway, anti-inflammatory action, and interaction with viral proteins. We suggest that 2-DG will be a potential adjuvant to enhance the efficacy of LDRT in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Withal, azido analog of 2-DG, 2-azido-2-DG can produce rapid catastrophic oxidative stress and quell the cytokine storm in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Verma, Amit; Adhikary, Amitava; Woloschak, Gayle; Dwarakanath, Bilikere S; Papineni, Rao V L",Int J Radiat Biol,,130

In particular, if has also affected the training of dental residents, who are specialists in training. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, perception and attitude of dental residents in Nigeria to the pandemic and its perceived impact on the dental residency training programme across the country. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of dental residents in teaching hospitals across Nigeria. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to consenting participants through an online data collection platform (Google forms), between April and June 2020. Data were collected on sociodemographics, knowledge and awareness of coronavirus as well as impact of the pandemic. Data analysis was carried out with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. Level of significance was set at p-value < .05. RESULTS: A total of 104 dental residents participated in the study from ten residency training institutions in the country with a mean age of 35.65 ± 4.8 years. Almost all 98 (94.2%) of the residents showed a good knowledge of COVID 19. About two-thirds, 72 (69.2%) of the participants were mostly worried about COVID-19 affecting their residency training program 72 (69.2%), with their greatest source of worry being the risk of contracting the virus in the dental clinic. CONCLUSION: The dental residents had a very good knowledge of the epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and majority of them felt that it would affect their training residency programme.","Isiekwe, Ikenna Gerald; Umeizudike, Kehinde Adesola; Daramola, Opeyemi O; Akeredolu, Mosopefoluwa O; Leo-Olagbaye, Afesobi Afunbiokin",Eur. j. dent. educ,,130

The World Health Organization (WHO) firstly used the term ""new coronavirus 2019"" on December 29, 2019. This pandemic, which is currently called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It was subsequently called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in all employees of the Nouakchott National Hospital Center (CHN). The study was conducted during the week 20/05/2020 to 27/05/2020. It involved 853 employees of all ranks (doctors, pharmacists, nurses, secretaries, security personnel, administrators...) of whom 504 were male and 331 were female, with a sex ratio of 1,52 with an average age of 39 years, ranging from 20 to 60 years. The screening for IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was performed using Biotime (Xiamen Biotime Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) immunochromatographic technique. Out of 835 employees included in our study, 14 were positive (1.67%) of whom 12 had IgM and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and 2 had isolated IgM. Nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in these 14 patients and was positive in six. While PCR is the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, in particular rapid tests (RDTs) are a diagnostic complement to COVID-19. They have the advantage of being easy to realize, of being safe both in the laboratories and outside the laboratories. RDTs enabled us to detect asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers within CHN employees. This allowed for patients management and isolation to protect patients and their environments.","Salem, Mohamed Lemine Ould; Sidiya, Mohamed Ahmed Med Mahmoud; Eibih, Ahmed Baba Ahmedou; Maouloud, Mohamed Mahmoud; Ngaide, Brahim Hamad; Dedy, Leila; Hamza, Lalla Mariem; Yacoub, Fatimetou",Pan Afr Med J,,130

Moreover, social distancing measures have made it harder for pregnant people to access support. ASSESSMENT: Prioritizing widespread access to COVID-19 testing and vaccination for pregnant people is critical to ensuring they receive safe and equitable care. Transparency in reporting outcomes including race and pregnancy status is key. Expanding telemedicine services to provide mental healthcare and labor support is necessary to maintain access to critical social networks. Additionally, resources must be allocated to pregnant people with complex social needs and are the most vulnerable. CONCLUSION: Policy centered on maintaining equity and agency in the care of pregnant people is imperative now and should continue as the standard moving forward to narrow racial disparities in maternal health outcomes.","Ojo, Ayotomiwa; Beckman, Adam L; Weiseth, Amber; Shah, Neel",Matern. child health j,,130

While extensive research has been conducted on the optimization of the video streaming pipeline, in particular the development of novel video codecs, further improvement in the video quality and latency is required, especially under poor network conditions. This paper proposes an alternative to the conventional codec through the implementation of a keypoint-centric encoder relying on the transmission of keypoint information from within a video feed, as shown in Figure 1. The decoder uses the streamed keypoints to generate a reconstruction preserving the semantic features in the input feed. Focusing on video calling applications, we detect and transmit the body pose and face mesh information through the network, which are displayed at the receiver in the form of animated puppets. Using efficient pose and face mesh detection in conjunction with skeleton-based animation, we demonstrate a prototype requiring lower than 35 kbps bandwidth, an order of magnitude reduction over typical video calling systems. The added computational latency due to the mesh extraction and animation is below 120ms on a standard laptop, showcasing the potential of this framework for real-time applications.

Increased use of electronic gadgets for academics and social interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic has extended the screen time of students, affecting sleep and eating patterns. Aim & Objective: To study the association of extended screen time on sleep pattern and calorie intake among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Settings and Design: Observational study was conducted using 'Google forms' to collect data on sleep and food intake among 60 college-going students. Methods and Material: Google form composed of questions related to demographic, anthropometry, screen time, sleep quality (PSQI) & dietary pattern (food frequency questionnaire) and tied to written consent was sent via WhatsApp to college students. Statistical analysis used: Data were grouped based on the screen time 10 hrs and &lt;/=10 hrs/day. Independent ""t"" test, Chi-square test and Mann Whitney test were used to compare the sleep domains scores and calorie intake. Results: With an average screen time of 10.9 hrs, 38% of students were using the screen maximally during the night. Poor Sleep Quality was (PSQI Score&gt;5) observed in 80% of the college students, with 46.6% having a sleep of &lt;5 hrs/day. Students' calorie intake was ten times the recommended daily requirement during the stay at home but was negatively related to screen-time, though non-significant. Conclusions: The study concludes that average screen time of students of age group 18-24 years have increased during night under the lockdown. This extended viewing in night has shifted the sleep circadian cycle to morning hours, with daytime sleepiness and poor sleep quality. The high calorie intake was also observed in students during lockdown though no correlation was established with the screen time and sleep quality.","Saxena, R.; Parmar, N.; Kaur, P.; Allen, T.",Indian Journal of Community Health,,130
296383,Mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: longitudinal analyses of adults in the UK COVID-19 Mental Health & Wellbeing study,2020,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown once again that coronavirus (CoV) in animals are potential sources for epidemics in humans. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging enteropathogen of swine with a worldwide distribution. Here, we implemented and described an approach to analyze the epidemiology of PDCoV following its emergence in the pig population. We performed an integrated analysis of full genome sequence data from 21 newly sequenced viruses, along with comprehensive epidemiological surveillance data collected globally over the last 15 years. We found four distinct phylogenetic lineages of PDCoV, which differ in their geographic circulation patterns. Interestingly, we identified more frequent intra- and interlineage recombination and higher virus genetic diversity in the Chinese lineages compared with the USA lineage where pigs are raised in different farming systems and ecological environments. Most recombination breakpoints are located in the ORF1ab gene rather than in genes encoding structural proteins. We also identified five amino acids under positive selection in the spike protein suggesting a role for adaptive evolution. According to structural mapping, three positively selected sites are located in the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit, which is the most likely involved in binding to a carbohydrate receptor, whereas the other two are located in or near the fusion peptide of the S2 subunit and thus might affect membrane fusion. Finally, our phylogeographic investigations highlighted notable South-North transmission as well as frequent long-distance dispersal events in China that could implicate human-mediated transmission. Our findings provide new insights into the evolution and dispersal of PDCoV that contribute to our understanding of the critical factors involved in CoVs emergence.","He, Wan-Ting; Ji, Xiang; He, Wei; Dellicour, Simon; Wang, Shilei; Li, Gairu; Zhang, Letian; Gilbert, Marius; Zhu, Henan; Xing, Gang; Veit, Michael; Huang, Zhen; Han, Guan-Zhu; Huang, Yaowei; Suchard, Marc A; Baele, Guy; Lemey, Philippe; Su, Shuo",Mol Biol Evol,,130

The 2019 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) provided an unforeseen opportunity to compare the response of two radiology departments, University Health System A (UHSA) and University Health System B (UHSAB). Preparing for this disaster was unique since though unexpected, was thought to be detected early enough to allow for sufficient preparation. Unlike many other disasters which are short-term, single events, this has been an on-going event. Changes at both health systems included workflow alterations for exposure reduction to faculty, trainees, and staff. UHSA was able to quickly divert workflow to previously deployed home workstations, while University of Utah Health Sciences Center required 2 to 3 weeks to procure and initialize enough remote workstations to significantly affect departmental operations. Other measures such as universal masking, temperature screening at facility entrances, virtual appointments, and physical barriers were used by both systems to limit patient-to-patient, patient-to-staff, staff-to-patient, and staff-staff physical interaction to help decrease exposure risk. The goal of these preparations is to allow each department to fulfill imaging needs in support of the organizational clinical mission with the flexibility to adapt to the unique and dynamic nature of this disaster.","Lowery, Bryce; Sandhu, Sameer; Cook, Tessa S; Prasanna, Prasanth",J Digit Imaging,,130

Materials and Methods: The CRITISCH Registry is a prospective, national, interdisciplinary, multicenter registry evaluating the current practice of all available treatment options in 1200 consecutive CLTI patients. For the purposes of this analysis, only the 337 patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD treated by either BG (n=86; median 78 years, 48 men) or EVT (n=251; median age 80 years, 135 men) were analyzed. The primary composite outcome was amputation-free survival (AFS); secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and amputation-free time (AFT). All outcomes were evaluated in Cox proportional hazards models; the results are reported as the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: The Cox regression analysis revealed a significantly greater hazard of amputation or death after BG (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.03, p=0.028). The models for AFT and overall survival also suggested a higher hazard for BG, but the differences were not significant (AFT: HR 1.66, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.53, p=0.188; OS: HR 1.41, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.47, p=0.348). The absence of runoff vessels (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.60, p=0.008) was associated with a decreased AFS. The likelihood of amputation was higher in male patients (HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 4.45, p=0.027) and was associated with a lack of runoff vessels (HR 1.95, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.95, p=0.065) and myocardial infarction (HR 3.74, 95% CI 1.23 to 11.35, p=0.020). Death was more likely in patients without runoff vessels (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.80, p=0.016) and those with a higher risk score (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.91, p=0.038). Conclusion: This analysis suggested that BG was associated with poorer AFS than EVT in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD and CLTI. Male sex, previous myocardial infarction, and the absence of runoff vessels were additionally identified as predictors of poorer outcomes.","Stavroulakis, Konstantinos; Gremoutis, Asimakis; Borowski, Matthias; Torsello, Giovanni; Böckler, Dittmar; Zeller, Thomas; Steinbauer, Markus; Tsilimparis, Nikolaos; Bisdas, Theodosios",J Endovasc Ther,,130
296453,Commentary: COVID-19 Mortality: A Matter of Vulnerability Among Nations Facing Limited Margins of Adaptation,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global pandemic. The World Health Organization has also declared an infodemic (ie, a plethora of information regarding COVID-19 containing both false and accurate information circulated on the internet). Hence, it has become critical to test the veracity of information shared online and analyze the evolution of discussed topics among citizens related to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This research analyzes the public discourse on COVID-19. It characterizes risk communication patterns in four Asian countries with outbreaks at varying degrees of severity: South Korea, Iran, Vietnam, and India. METHODS: We collected tweets on COVID-19 from four Asian countries in the early phase of the disease outbreak from January to March 2020. The data set was collected by relevant keywords in each language, as suggested by locals. We present a method to automatically extract a time-topic cohesive relationship in an unsupervised fashion based on natural language processing. The extracted topics were evaluated qualitatively based on their semantic meanings. RESULTS: This research found that each government's official phases of the epidemic were not well aligned with the degree of public attention represented by the daily tweet counts. Inspired by the issue-attention cycle theory, the presented natural language processing model can identify meaningful transition phases in the discussed topics among citizens. The analysis revealed an inverse relationship between the tweet count and topic diversity. CONCLUSIONS: This paper compares similarities and differences of pandemic-related social media discourse in Asian countries. We observed multiple prominent peaks in the daily tweet counts across all countries, indicating multiple issue-attention cycles. Our analysis identified which topics the public concentrated on; some of these topics were related to misinformation and hate speech. These findings and the ability to quickly identify key topics can empower global efforts to fight against an infodemic during a pandemic.","Park, Sungkyu; Han, Sungwon; Kim, Jeongwook; Molaie, Mir Majid; Vu, Hoang Dieu; Singh, Karandeep; Han, Jiyoung; Lee, Wonjae; Cha, Meeyoung",J Med Internet Res,,130

Indications include refractory Cushing's disease (CD) following failed pituitary surgery, and occult or unresectable ectopic ACTH-producing neoplasms (EA). METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective review (1995-2017) of patients undergoing BA for CD or EA. Demographics, laboratory findings, and intraoperative and postoperative variables were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 137 patients, 83 (61%) had CD and 54 (39%) had EA; 87% of CD patients were female versus 46% of EA patients (p < 0.0001). Mean age at diagnosis was 40 ± 15 years for CD and 49 ± 18 years for EA (p = 0.004). Preoperative serum cortisol concentrations were higher in the EA cohort (63 ± 40 µg/dL) versus the CD cohort (33 ± 19 µg/dL) [p < 0.001], with no significant differences in serum ACTH. Time from diagnosis until adrenalectomy was 54 ± 69 months for CD versus 4 ± 13 for EA (p = 0.002). Most patients underwent minimally invasive surgery (MIS; 86% CD vs. 75% EA; p = 0.19). There was no difference between the rates of conversion to an open approach, intraoperative blood loss, or operative time between groups, and no difference between complications in CD versus EA (p = 1.0). Five-year survival was significantly shorter among the EA cohort (30% for EA vs. 80% for CD; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients with EA presented with higher serum cortisol levels compared with patients with CD. EA patients were more likely to require intraoperative transfusion and postoperative intensive care. BA in patients with CD and EA can be performed safely in an MIS fashion, with similar morbidity; however, survival at 5 years was significantly less in the EA cohort.","Szabo Yamashita, Thomas; Sada, Alaa; Bancos, Irina; Young, William F; Dy, Benzon M; Farley, David R; Lyden, Melanie L; Thompson, Geoffrey B; McKenzie, Travis J",Ann. surg. oncol,,130

298282,Improving mental health services beyond COVID-19,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 has become a pandemic causing a serious global health concern. The absence of effective drugs for treatment of the disease has caused its rapid spread on a global scale. Similarly to the SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 is also involved in a complex interplay with the host cells. This infection is characterized by a diffused alveolar damage consistent with the Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS). To explore the complex mechanisms of the disease at the system level, we used a network medicine tools approach. The protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between the SARS-CoV and the associated human cell proteins are crucial for the viral pathogenesis. Since the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is accomplished by binding of the spike glycoprotein binding domain (RBD) to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), a molecule that can bind to the spike RDB-hACE2 interface could block the virus entry. Here, we performed a virtual screening of 55 compounds to identify potential molecules that can bind to the spike glycoprotein and spike-ACE2 complex interface. It was found that the compound ethyl 1-{3-[(2,4-dichlorobenzyl) carbamoyl]-1-ethyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-7-quinolinyl}-4-piperidine carboxylate (the S54 ligand) and ethyl 1-{3-[(2,4-dichlorobenzyl) carbamoyl]-1-ethyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-7-quinolinyl}-4 piperazine carboxylate (the S55 ligand) forms hydrophobic interactions with Tyr41A, Tyr505B and Tyr553B, Leu29A, Phe495B, respectively of the spike glycoprotein, the hotspot residues in the spike glycoprotein RBD-hACE2 binding interface. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations using the MM-GBSA method showed that the S54 ligand is a stronger binder than a known SARS-CoV spike inhibitor SSAA09E3 (N-(9,10-dioxo-9, 10-dihydroanthracen-2-yl) benzamide).

The economic trend is modelled by an inverse function of GDPpc with a constant numerator which varies for the largest developed economies. In 2006, a statistical analysis conducted for 19 selected OECD countries for the period between 1950 and 2003 showed a very weak linear trend in the annual GDPpc increment for the largest economies: the USA, Japan, France, Italy, and Spain. The UK, Australia, and Canada showed a slightly steeper positive linear trend. The 2012 revision showed that the positive trends became much lower and some of them fell below zero due to the Great Recession. The fluctuations around the trend values are characterized by a quasi-normal distribution with heavy and asymmetric tails. This research revises the previous estimates and extends the set of studied countries by economies in East Europe, Latin America, BRICS, Africa, and Asia including several positive outliers with extremely fast growth. The change in GDP definitions and measuring procedures with time and economic source is discussed in relation to the statistical significance of the trend estimates and data quality requirements for a consistent economic model. The relative performance of all counties since 1960 is compared according to the predicted total GDPpc growth as a function of the initial value. The performance in the 21st century is analyzed separately as revealing potential and actual shifts in the global economic powers.","Kitov, Ivan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.10986v1.pdf,130

Considering the findings of previous studies on the use of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) for treating severe H1N1 infection and the satisfying results for reducing viral load and mortality, this study aimed to investigate the potential usefulness of IVIg for the management of severe cases. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 84 patients were included: 52 in the IVIg group and 32 in the control group. The intervention group received IVIg at a dose of 400 mg/kg, IV, daily for three days. Both groups received hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and supportive care. The demographic data, mortality rate, the need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay in hospital and in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and imaging findings were recorded and compared in terms of the mentioned factors. RESULTS: The mean time from admission to IVIg initiation was 3.84 ± 3.35 days. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of mortality rate (P-value = 0.8) and the need for mechanical ventilation (P-value = 0.39). The length of hospital stay was significantly lower for the control group than that of the intervention group (P-value = 0.003). There was a significant positive relationship between the time from hospital admission to IVIg initiation and the length of stay in the hospital and ICU among the survivors (P-value < 0.001 and =0.01, respectively).

Patients and Methods: After controlling the COVID-19 situation in the country, China reopened the entire country, including Wuhan, which was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. A well-structured questionnaire was sent to Chinese students through a WeChat survey, a special feature within this mobile application, similar to Google Docs. The link was sent to 2000 students studying in Germany, and we received 1232 responses. Results: The study found that the majority of Chinese students are willing to come back to China, considering the current risk of COVID-19 in Germany. A higher mortality rate influences their wish to return to China. Additionally, the special family size of ""One Child"" in the family also a key driver of Chinese student's wish to get back home. Conclusion: This study provides useful information to policymakers to implement proactive measures to manage students who want to return to China, as they may be the cause of the second wave of COVID-19 in China.","Zhu, X.; Ahmad, M.

The real danger has produced prolonged stress. Large-group phenomena have been stimulated. Overwhelming affects generated by the real danger have led to regression in the stimulus barrier (or ""filter""). The COVID-19 has also triggered unconscious defensive reactions, including obsessional cleaning, counterphobic behavior, humor, and denial. The nationally imposed home quarantine of millions of families has caused in-home conflicts and neurotic repetitions of unresolved childhood issues. Prior psychiatric illnesses have been exacerbated. Health workers, including psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychoanalysts, have experienced emotional depletion. Finally, in families where there has been infection or death, delayed mourning and post-traumatic phenomena have been observed. In each of these situations, different interventions based on psychoanalytic principles have been useful.","Blackman, Jerome S",Am J Psychoanal,,130

The evolutionary origins of the virus remain elusive and understanding its complex mutational signatures could guide vaccine design and development. As part of the international ""CoronaHack"" in April 2020, we employed a collection of contemporary methodologies to compare the genomic sequences of coronaviruses isolated from human (SARS-CoV-2; n = 163), bat (bat-CoV; n = 215) and pangolin (pangolin-CoV; n = 7) available in public repositories. We have also noted the pangolin-CoV isolate MP789 to bare stronger resemblance to SARS-CoV-2 than other pangolin-CoV. Following de novo gene annotation prediction, analyses of gene-gene similarity network, codon usage bias and variant discovery were undertaken. Strong host-associated divergences were noted in ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8 and S, and in codon usage bias profiles. Last, we have characterised several high impact variants (in-frame insertion/deletion or stop gain) in bat-CoV and pangolin-CoV populations, some of which are found in the same amino acid position and may be highlighting loci of potential functional relevance.","Dimonaco, Nicholas J; Salavati, Mazdak; Shih, Barbara B",Viruses,,130

311150,Addressing collegiate mental health amid COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Potential unreported infection might impair and mislead policymaking for COVID-19, and the contemporary spread of COVID-19 varies in different counties of the United States. It is necessary to estimate the cases that might be underestimated based on county-level data, to take better countermeasures against COVID-19. We suggested taking time-varying Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models with unreported infection rates (UIR) to estimate factual COVID-19 cases in the United States. METHODS: Both the SIR model integrated with unreported infection rates (SIRu) of fixed-time effect and SIRu with time-varying parameters (tvSIRu) were applied to estimate and compare the values of transmission rate (TR), UIR, and infection fatality rate (IFR) based on US county-level COVID-19 data. RESULTS: Based on the US county-level COVID-19 data from 22 January (T1) to 20 August (T212) in 2020, SIRu was first tested and verified by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. Further regression of SIRu at the county-level showed that the average values of TR, UIR, and IFR were 0.034%, 19.5%, and 0.51% respectively. The ranges of TR, UIR, and IFR for all states ranged from 0.007-0.157 (mean = 0.048), 7.31-185.6 (mean = 38.89), and 0.04-2.22% (mean = 0.22%). Among the time-varying TR equations, the power function showed better fitness, which indicated a decline in TR decreasing from 227.58 (T1) to 0.022 (T212). The general equation of tvSIRu showed that both the UIR and IFR were gradually increasing, wherein, the estimated value of UIR was 9.1 (95%CI 5.7-14.0) and IFR was 0.70% (95%CI 0.52-0.95%) at T212. INTERPRETATION: Despite the declining trend in TR and IFR, the UIR of COVID-19 in the United States is still on the rise, which, it was assumed would decrease with sufficient tests or improved countersues. The US medical system might be largely affected by severe cases amidst a rapid spread of COVID-19.","Peng, Zhenghong; Ao, Siya; Liu, Lingbo; Bao, Shuming; Hu, Tao; Wu, Hao; Wang, Ru",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,130

314027,Corrigendum: Online Mental Health Survey in a Medical College in China During the COVID-19 Outbreak,2020,"COVID-19, which is caused by the single-stranded RNA severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has introduced significant therapeutic dilemmas in several areas. One of these is concern regarding the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors. Dysfunction of the RAS has been observed in COVID-19 patients, but whether RAS inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs), are associated with improved or worse clinical outcomes, remains unclear. RAS inhibitors are currently widely used in the treatment of hypertension. Emerging data suggest an increased association and a heightened mortality in patients of COVID-19 with co-morbidities such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes mellitus, particularly in the elderly. Therefore, several recently published research papers have focused on the management of hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic, as this co-morbidity was found to be the most common in patients with coronavirus infections. SARS-CoV-2 viral surface protein is known to attach angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) on the cell membrane to facilitate viral entry into the cytoplasm. While the SARS-CoV-2 viral load remains the highest in upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients, it has also been reported in multiple sites in COVID-19, and patients not infrequently require the Intensive Care Units (ICU) admission. However, despite the theoretical concerns of possible increased ACE2 expression by RAS blockade, there is no evidence that RAS inhibitors are harmful during COVID-19 infection, and indeed they have been shown to be beneficial in some animal studies. In this review we summarise the pathophysiology of the interaction between RAS, ACEIs/ARBs inhibitors and COVID-19, and conclude, on the basis of current data, that RAS blockade should be maintained during the current coronavirus pandemic.","Dworakowska, D; Grossman, A B",J. physiol. pharmacol,,130
314279,Reflections on Ethics and Advocacy in Child Health (REACH): Creating a Forum for Ethical Dialogue,2021,"Hypertension has been listed in several case series and retrospective cohorts as a potential risk factor for the incidence and severity of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-associated disease (COVID-19). The debate is noteworthy because almost one billion people around the globe are estimated to have hypertensive diseases, according to the Global Burden of Disease study. Considering the SARS-CoV-2's high infectivity rates, a possible interaction between COVID-19 and hypertension is worrisome. Additionally, antihypertensive drugs, especially the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, could also influence the natural course of COVID-19 infection. Not only can these associations hold from an epidemiologic standpoint, a mechanistic scenario possibly exists. Hypertension and antihypertensive drugs can increase the expression of transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors, the entry target of the viruses, thus facilitating infectivity. On the other hand, an increase in ACE-2 could be protective considering the anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic effects of the ACE-2-angiotensin 1-7/Mas pathway. So far, little is known about the whole picture. Observational studies appear to indicate at least a twofold increased risk of mortality for hypertensive patients with COVID-19; however, the previous and continued use of RAAS inhibitors may be protective in this subgroup of patients. The scarcity of randomized clinical trials precludes evidence-based decision-making. At least one randomized study in a non-specified sub-analysis demonstrated no relationship between an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and incidence or severity of the disease. It is reflected mainly by observational studies and, therefore, by international cardiology societies' guidelines, which state that antihypertensive drugs, particularly RAAS inhibitors, should not be discontinued unless necessary on a case-by-case basis.","Quinaglia, Thiago; Shabani, Mahsima; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,,130

314986,Chinese mental health burden during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Adolescence represents a crucial developmental period in shaping mental health trajectories. In this study, we investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and substance use during this sensitive developmental stage. METHODS: In this longitudinal, population-based study, surveys were administered to a nationwide sample of 13-18-year-olds in Iceland in October or February in 2016 and 2018, and in October, 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). The surveys assessed depressive symptoms with the Symptom Checklist-90, mental wellbeing with the Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, and the frequency of cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use, and alcohol intoxication. Demographic data were collected, which included language spoken at home although not ethnicity data. We used mixed effects models to study the effect of gender, age, and survey year on trends in mental health outcomes. FINDINGS: 59 701 survey responses were included; response rates ranged from 63% to 86%. An increase in depressive symptoms (ß 0·57, 95% CI 0·53 to 0·60) and worsened mental wellbeing (ß -0·46, 95% CI -0·49 to -0·42) were observed across all age groups during the pandemic compared with same-aged peers before COVID-19. These outcomes were significantly worse in adolescent girls compared with boys (ß 4·16, 95% CI 4·05 to 4·28, and ß -1·13, 95% CI -1·23 to -1·03, respectively). Cigarette smoking (OR 2·61, 95% CI 2·59 to 2·66), e-cigarette use (OR 2·61, 95% CI 2·59 to 2·64), and alcohol intoxication (OR 2·59, 95% CI 2·56 to 2·64) declined among 15-18-year-olds during COVID-19, with no similar gender differences. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that COVID-19 has significantly impaired adolescent mental health. However, the decrease observed in substance use during the pandemic might be an unintended benefit of isolation, and might serve as a protective factor against future substance use disorders and dependence. Population-level prevention efforts, especially for girls, are warranted. FUNDING: Icelandic Research Fund.

318673,Telepsychotherapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Experience of Lebanese Mental Health Professionals,2021,"Identifying""superspreaders""of disease is a pressing concern for society during pandemics such as COVID-19. Superspreaders represent a group of people who have much more social contacts than others. The widespread deployment of WLAN infrastructure enables non-invasive contact tracing via people's ubiquitous mobile devices. This technology offers promise for detecting superspreaders. In this paper, we propose a general framework for WLAN-log-based superspreader detection. In our framework, we first use WLAN logs to construct contact graphs by jointly considering human symmetric and asymmetric interactions. Next, we adopt three vertex centrality measurements over the contact graphs to generate three groups of superspreader candidates. Finally, we leverage SEIR simulation to determine groups of superspreaders among these candidates, who are the most critical individuals for the spread of disease based on the simulation results. We have implemented our framework and evaluate it over a WLAN dataset with 41 million log entries from a large-scale university. Our evaluation shows superspreaders exist on university campuses. They change over the first few weeks of a semester, but stabilize throughout the rest of the term. The data also demonstrate that both symmetric and asymmetric contact tracing can discover superspreaders, but the latter performs better with daily contact graphs. Further, the evaluation shows no consistent differences among three vertex centrality measures for long-term (i.e., weekly) contact graphs, which necessitates the inclusion of SEIR simulation in our framework. We believe our proposed framework and these results may provide timely guidance for public health administrators regarding effective testing, intervention, and vaccination policies.","Zhang, Cheng; Pan, Yunze; Zhang, Yunqi; Champion, Adam C.; Shen, Zhaohui; Xuan, Dong; Lin, Zhiqiang; Shroff, Ness B.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11171v1.pdf,130

To bring perspective to this discussion, we used NMR to compare the obesity-associated metabolomic profiles of the lung with those of the liver, heart, skeletal muscles, kidneys, brain and serum from male C57Bl/6J mice fed with a high-fat and high-sucrose (HFHSD) diet vs. standard (SD) chow for 14 weeks. Our results showed that the lung was the second most affected organ after the liver, and that the two organs shared reduced one-carbon (1C) metabolism and increased lipid accumulation. Altered 1C metabolism was found in all organs and in the serum, but serine levels were increased only in the lung of HFHSD compared to SD. Lastly, tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-derived metabolites were specifically and oppositely regulated in the serum and kidneys but not in other organs. Collectively, our data highlighted that HFHSD induced specific metabolic changes in all organs, the lung being the second most affected organ, the main alterations affecting metabolite concentrations of the 1C pathway and, to a minor extend, TCA. The absolute metabolite quantification performed in this study reveals some metabolic specificities affecting both the liver and the lung, that may reveal common metabolic determinants to the ongoing pathological process.","Rautureau, G J P; Morio, B; Guibert, S; Lefevre, C; Perrier, J; Alves, A; Chauvin, M A; Pinteur, C; Monet, M A; Godet, M; Madec, A M; Rieusset, J; Mey, A; Panthu, Baptiste",Sci Rep,,130

325226,Philosophy for children and mindfulness during COVID-19: Results from a randomized cluster trial and impact on mental health in elementary school students,2021,"The current COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019 in Wuhan (China) and rapidly extended to become a global sanitary and economic emergency. Its etiological agent is the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 presents a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, which ranges from an asymptomatic infection to a severe pneumonia accompanied by multisystemic failure that can lead to a patient's death. The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is known to involve all the components of the immune system that together appear responsible for viral elimination and recovery from the infection. Nonetheless, such immune responses are implicated in the disease's progression to a more severe and lethal process. This review describes the general aspects of both COVID-19 and its etiological agent SARS-CoV-2, stressing the similarities with other severe coronavirus infections, such as SARS and MERS, but more importantly, pointing toward the evidence supporting the hypothesis that the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is a consequence of the corresponding variable spectrum of the immune responses to the virus. The critical point where progression of the disease ensues appears to center on loss of the immune regulation between protective and altered responses due to exacerbation of the inflammatory components. Finally, it appears possible to delineate certain major challenges deserving of exhaustive investigation to further understand COVID-19 immunopathogenesis, thus helping to design more effective diagnostic, therapeutic, and prophylactic strategies.","García, Luis F",Front Immunol,,130

It treats the sectors in isolation which does not represent an interdependent macroeconomic system. The Inoperability Input-Output Model (IIM) is a disaster impact analysis model that considers the interdependency of economic sectors in measuring the impact of disasters. Although it can be exploited for Government subsidy allocation, no attempt has yet been made for such in view of optimization. Testing this approach against the conventional method is also not yet explored. A proposed Subsidy Optimization Model (SOM) is developed in this study to address the abovementioned gaps. The SOM is tested in the Philippines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sensitivity and comparative scenario analysis are employed and policy implications are determined. Results show that the SOM's allocation scheme is superior to conventional approaches. Prioritizing small sectors yields minimum production loss in the Philippines.","Selerio, Egberto Filosopo Maglasang Renan Semblante",Structural Change and Economic Dynamics,,130
326080,The Cause of Mental Health Problem Among Urban Residents During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Implication for information Communication,2021,"Telomeres are non-coding DNA sequences that protect chromosome ends and shorten with age. Short telomere length (TL) is associated with chronic diseases and immunosenescence. The main risk factor for mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is older age, but outcome is very heterogeneous among individuals of the same age group. Therefore, we hypothesized that TL influences COVID-19-related outcomes. In a prospective study, we measured TL by Flow-FISH in 70 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and compared TL distribution with our reference cohort of 491 healthy volunteers. We also correlated TL with baseline clinical and biological parameters. We stained autopsy lung tissue from six non-survivor COVID-19 patients to detect senescence-associated ß-galactosidase activity, a marker of cellular aging. We found a significantly higher proportion of patients with short telomeres (<10th percentile) in the COVID-19 patients as compared to the reference cohort (P<0.001). Short telomeres were associated with a higher risk of critical disease, defined as admission to intensive care unit (ICU) or death without ICU. TL was negatively correlated with C-reactive protein and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Finally, lung tissue from patients with very short telomeres exhibit signs of senescence in structural and immune cells. Our results suggest that TL influences the severity of the disease.","Froidure, Antoine; Mahieu, Manon; Hoton, Delphine; Laterre, Pierre-François; Yombi, Jean Cyr; Koenig, Sandra; Ghaye, Benoit; Defour, Jean-Philippe; Decottignies, Anabelle",Aging (Albany NY),,130

Since the beginning of the pandemic, different comorbidities have been postulated and associated with spectra of increased severity and mortality. The objectives of this research are: 1) to analyse the factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) in a health area in northern Spain; 2) to understand the possible role of influenza vaccination and pneumococcal vaccination in the development of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A test-negative case-control study was conducted. Variables related to personal and vaccination history were considered. Although the epidemiological definition of the case varied over time, the reference definition was that corresponding to 31/01/2020 in Spain. A bivariate and multivariate analysis was performed. RESULTS: The sample included 188 patients, of which 63 were cases and 125 controls. The results show that obesity increases the risk 2.4-fold of suffering this infection (IC 95% 1,301-4,521) and ARA-2 increases it 2.2-fold (95% CI 1,256-6,982). On the other hand, anti-pneumococcal vaccination of 13 serotypes showed results close to statistical significance (OR = 0.4; 95% CI 0.170-1,006). CONCLUSION: Obesity and the use of ARA-2 increases the risk of COVID-19. Scientific knowledge about factors associated with COVID-19 should be expanded. The authors consider that the present research raises the need further investigate the role of vaccines in this infection and their possible heterologous properties.","Fernández-Prada, María; García-González, Paula; García-Morán, Alejandro; Ruiz-Álvarez, Inés; Ramas-Diez, Covadonga; Calvo-Rodríguez, Carmen",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),,130

METHODS: In this prospective study, we compared 0 vs. non-0 blood group in hypertensive patients with covid-19 infection. In these patients, we evaluated inflammatory and thrombotic status, cardiac injury, and death events. RESULTS: Patients in non-0 (n = 92) vs. 0 blood group (n = 72) had significantly different values of activated pro-thrombin time, D-dimer, and thrombotic indexes as Von Willebrand factor and Factor VIII (p < 0.05). Furthermore, patients in non-0 vs. 0 blood group had higher rate of cardiac injury (10 (13.9%) vs. 27 (29.3%)) and death, (6 (8.3%) vs. 18 (19.6%)), (p < 0.05). At the multivariate analysis, Interleukin-6 (1.118, CI 95% 1.067-1.171) and non-0 blood group (2.574, CI 95% 1.207-5.490) were independent predictors of cardiac injury in hypertensive patients with covid-19. D-dimer (1.082, CI 95% 1.027-1.140), Interleukin-6 (1.216, CI 95% 1.082-1.367) and non-0 blood group (3.706, CI 95% 1.223-11.235) were independent predictors of deaths events in hypertensive patients with covid-19. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data indicate that non-0 covid-19 hypertensive patients have significantly higher values of pro-thrombotic indexes, as well as higher rate of cardiac injury and deaths compared to 0 patients. Moreover, AB0 blood type influences worse prognosis in hypertensive patients with covid-19 infection.","Sardu, Celestino; Marfella, Raffaele; Maggi, Paolo; Messina, Vincenzo; Cirillo, Paolo; Codella, Vinicio; Gambardella, Jessica; Sardu, Antonio; Gatta, Gianluca; Santulli, Gaetano; Paolisso, Giuseppe",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,,130

Previous studies suggest that obesity is a possible risk factor for adverse outcomes in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the association between obesity and COVID-19 outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 hospitalized patients tested between March 10 and April 13, 2020. SETTING: SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, a COVID-only hospital in New York. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 684 patients were tested for COVID-19 and 504 were analyzed. Patients were categorized into three groups by BMI: normal (BMI 18.50-24.99), overweight (BMI 25.00-29.99), and obese (BMI &#8805; 30.00). MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was 30-day in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were intubation, acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute cardiac injury (ACI). RESULTS: There were 139 patients (27%) with normal BMI, 150 patients who were overweight (30%), and 215 patients with obesity (43%). After controlling for age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, and qSOFA score, there was a significantly increased risk of mortality in the overweight (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.9) and obese groups (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.7) compared with those with normal BMI. Similarly, there was a significantly increased relative risk for intubation in the overweight (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.3) and obese groups (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.5-4.0) compared with those with normal BMI. Obesity did not affect rates of AKI, ACI, or ARDS. Furthermore, obesity appears to significantly increase the risk of mortality in males (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-2.0, P = 0.03), but not in females (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.77-1.9, P = 0.40). CONCLUSION: This study reveals that patients with overweight and obesity who have COVID-19 are at increased risk for mortality and intubation compared to those with normal BMI. These findings support the hypothesis that obesity is a risk factor for COVID-19 complications and should be a consideration in management of COVID-19.","Nakeshbandi, Mohamed; Maini, Rohan; Daniel, Pia; Rosengarten, Sabrina; Parmar, Priyanka; Wilson, Clara; Kim, Julie Minjae; Oommen, Alvin; Mecklenburg, Max; Salvani, Jerome; Joseph, Michael A; Breitman, Igal",Int J Obes (Lond),,130
331499,Responding to the Under-Utilisation of Necessary Health Care in the Time of COVID-19: A Precision Public Health intervention,2021,"After a year of evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, there is still no specific effective treatment for the disease. Although the majority of infected people experience mild disease, some patients develop a serious disease, especially when other pathologies concur. For this reason, it would be very convenient to find pharmacological and immunological mechanisms that help control SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since the COVID-19 and BCoV viruses are very close phylogenetically, different studies demonstrate the existence of cross-immunity as they retain shared epitopes in their structure. As a possible control measure against COVID-19, we propose the use of cow's milk immune to BCoV. Thus, the antigenic recognition of some highly conserved structures of viral proteins, particularly M and S2, by anti-BCoV antibodies present in milk would cause a total or partial inactivation of SARS-COV-2 (acting as a particular vaccine) and be addressed more easily by GALT's highly specialized antigen-presenting cells, thus helping the specific immune response.","Arenas, Antonio; Borge, Carmen; Carbonero, Alfonso; Garcia-Bocanegra, Ignacio; Cano-Terriza, David; Caballero, Javier; Arenas-Montes, Antonio",Front Immunol,,130
331858,COVID-19 as a risk factor for obstetric violence,2020,"The development of more effective, accessible and easy to administer COVID-19 vaccines next to the currently marketed mRNA, viral vector and whole inactivated virus vaccines, is essential to curtain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A major concern is reduced vaccine-induced immune protection to emerging variants, and therefore booster vaccinations to broaden and strengthen the immune response might be required. Currently, all registered COVID-19 vaccines and the majority of COVID-19 vaccines in development are intramuscularly administered, targeting the induction of systemic immunity. Intranasal vaccines have the capacity to induce local mucosal immunity as well, thereby targeting the primary route of viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 with the potential of blocking transmission. Furthermore, intranasal vaccines offer greater practicality in terms of cost and ease of administration. Currently, only eight out of 112 vaccines in clinical development are administered intranasally. We developed an intranasal COVID-19 subunit vaccine, based on a recombinant, six proline stabilized, D614G spike protein (mC-Spike) of SARS-CoV-2 linked via the LPS-binding peptide sequence mCramp (mC) to Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) from Neisseria meningitidis. The spike protein was produced in CHO cells and after linking to the OMVs, the OMV-mC-Spike vaccine was administered to mice and Syrian hamsters via intranasal or intramuscular prime-boost vaccinations. In all animals that received OMV-mC-Spike, serum neutralizing antibodies were induced upon vaccination. Importantly, high levels of spike-binding immunoglobulin G (IgG) and A (IgA) antibodies in the nose and lungs were only detected in intranasally vaccinated animals, whereas intramuscular vaccination only induced an IgG response in the serum. Two weeks after their second vaccination hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs compared to the control groups vaccinated with OMV or spike alone. Histopathology showed no lesions in lungs seven days after challenge in OMV-mC-Spike vaccinated hamsters, whereas the control groups did show pathological lesions in the lung. The OMV-mC-Spike candidate vaccine data are very promising and support further development of this novel non-replicating, needle-free, subunit vaccine concept for clinical testing.","Ley, Peter A. van der; Zariri, Afshin; Riet, Elly van; Oosterhoff, Dinja; Kruiswijk, Corine P.",,,130
331940,"Alabama university to study emotions, behavior and COVID-19",2020,"PROBLEM: Subinternships are integral to medical education as tools for teaching and assessing fourth-year medical students. Social distancing due to COVID-19 has precluded the ability to offer in-person subinternships - negatively impacting medical education and creating uncertainty surrounding the residency match. With no precedent for the development and implementation of virtual subinternships, the Society of Academic Urologists (SAU) developed an innovative and standardized curriculum for the Virtual Subinternship in Urology (vSIU). METHODS: The vSIU committee's mandate was to create a standardized curriculum for teaching foundational urology and assessing student performance. Thirty-three members from 23 institutions were divided into working groups and given 3 weeks to develop 10 modules based on urologic subspecialties, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies, technical skills training and student assessment. Working groups were encouraged to develop innovative learning approaches. The final curriculum was assembled into the ""vSIU Guidebook."" RESULTS: The vSIU Guidebook contains 212 pages - 64 pages core content and 2 appendices (patient cases and evaluations). It outlines a detailed 4-week curriculum with a sufficient volume of resources to offer a completely adaptable virtual course with the same rigor as a traditional subinternship. Modules contain curated teaching resources including journal articles, lectures, surgical videos and simulated clinical scenarios. Innovative learning tools include reflective writing, mentorship guidelines, videoconference-based didactics, surgical simulcasting and virtual technical skills training. The guidebook was disseminated to program directors nationally. NEXT STEPS: The vSIU is the first virtual subinternship in any specialty to be standardized and offered nationally, and it was implemented by at least 19 urology programs. This curriculum serves as a template for other specialties looking to develop virtual programs and feedback from educators and students will allow the curriculum to evolve.

TMPRSS2 was first characterized as an androgen-regulated gene in the prostate. Supporting a role for sex hormones, males relative to females are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in terms of mortality and morbidity. Several studies, including one employing a large epidemiological cohort, suggested that blocking androgen signaling is protective against COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate that androgens regulate the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and androgen receptor (AR) in subsets of lung epithelial cells. AR levels are markedly elevated in males relative to females greater than 70 y of age. In males greater than 70 y old, smoking was associated with elevated levels of AR and ACE2 in lung epithelial cells. Transcriptional repression of the AR enhanceosome with AR or bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) antagonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Taken together, these studies support further investigation of transcriptional inhibition of critical host factors in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.","Qiao, Yuanyuan; Wang, Xiao-Ming; Mannan, Rahul; Pitchiaya, Sethuramasundaram; Zhang, Yuping; Wotring, Jesse W; Xiao, Lanbo; Robinson, Dan R; Wu, Yi-Mi; Tien, Jean Ching-Yi; Cao, Xuhong; Simko, Stephanie A; Apel, Ingrid J; Bawa, Pushpinder; Kregel, Steven; Narayanan, Sathiya P; Raskind, Gregory; Ellison, Stephanie J; Parolia, Abhijit; Zelenka-Wang, Sylvia; McMurry, Lisa; Su, Fengyun; Wang, Rui; Cheng, Yunhui; Delekta, Andrew D; Mei, Zejie; Pretto, Carla D; Wang, Shaomeng; Mehra, Rohit; Sexton, Jonathan Z; Chinnaiyan, Arul M",Proc.

The RCS is a dynamic survey tool used predominantly in the analyses of public opinion during electoral campaigns. Because of its dynamic nature, we argue that it is an ideal instrument to monitor public opinion during a pandemic. Specifically, we present an RCS online survey implemented in Italy from April to July 2020 and we present some illustrative analyses of changes in behaviors, attitudes, and opinions during the Covid-19 crisis to highlight the potential of the design. Ultimately, we assert that RCS surveys could be very powerful instruments to inform policy makers of the dynamics of public opinion during a crisis, especially when inserted within existent high-quality survey infrastructures.","Vezzoni, Cristiano; Ladini, Riccardo; Molteni, Francesco; Dotti Sani, Giulia M.; Biolcati, Ferruccio; Chiesi, Antonio M.; Guglielmi, Simona; Maraffi, Marco; Pedrazzani, Andrea; Segatti, Paolo",Surv.

We used a longitudinal design (Nâ¯=â¯1615, 26% with mental disorder history). Successive samplings were performed from three days before quarantine start and across quarantine phases of up to 103-days duration. Follow-up was one month later. Sex (woman) and age (younger) were significant predictors of worse mental health only in college students without mental disorder background. Having any suicidal behavior background significantly predicted worse mental health in college students both with and without mental disorder history. Loneliness and region of residence were not statistically significant. In the between-groups comparisons, college students having mental disorder background had worse mental health than those without such a background. However, in the within-subject comparisons, no statistically significant changes occurred across time in the mental health of college students having mental disorder history. Conversely, significant changes occurred in those without such a background, but only when the interaction between time and quarantine duration was considered. Worsening mental health occurred during the most heavily restrictive quarantine phases, while some of the remissions occurred during the longest, but less restrictive ones.","López Steinmetz, Lorena Cecilia; Fong, Shao Bing; Godoy, Juan Carlos",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,130

Understanding the underlying temporal and spatial dynamics in the spread of COVID-19 can result in informed and timely public health policies. In this paper, we use a spatio-temporal stochastic model to explain the temporal and spatial variations in the daily number of new confirmed cases in Spain, Italy and Germany from late February to mid September 2020. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we found that the temporal trend of the epidemic in the three countries rapidly reached their peaks and slowly started to decline at the beginning of April and then increased and reached their second maximum in August. However decline and increase of the temporal trend seems to be sharper in Spain and smoother in Germany. The spatial heterogeneity of the relative risk of COVID-19 in Spain is also more pronounced than Italy and Germany.","Jalilian, Abdollah; Mateu, Jorge",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.13577v1.pdf,130

336928,Establishment of a hospital-based health care workers surveillance programme to keep them safe during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnostic strategies to identify SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals rapidly for management of patient care and protection of health care personnel are urgently needed. The predominant diagnostic test is viral RNA detection by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs specimens, however the results are not promptly obtainable in all patient care locations. Routine laboratory testing, in contrast, is readily available with a turn-around time (TAT) usually within 1-2 hours. METHOD: We developed a machine learning model incorporating patient demographic features (age, sex, race) with 27 routine laboratory tests to predict an individual's SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Laboratory testing results obtained within 2 days before the release of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result were used to train a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model from 3,356 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tested patients (1,402 positive and 1,954 negative) evaluated at a metropolitan hospital. RESULTS: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.854 (95% CI: 0.829-0.878). Application of this model to an independent patient dataset from a separate hospital resulted in a comparable AUC (0.838), validating the generalization of its use. Moreover, our model predicted initial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity in 66% individuals whose RT-PCR result changed from negative to positive within 2 days. CONCLUSION: This model employing routine laboratory test results offers opportunities for early and rapid identification of high-risk SARS-CoV-2 infected patients before their RT-PCR results are available. It may play an important role in assisting the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in areas where RT-PCR testing is not accessible due to financial or supply constraints.","Yang, He S; Hou, Yu; Vasovic, Ljiljana V; Steel, Peter A D; Chadburn, Amy; Racine-Brzostek, Sabrina E; Velu, Priya; Cushing, Melissa M; Loda, Massimo; Kaushal, Rainu; Zhao, Zhen; Wang, Fei",Clin Chem,,130

People were asked to stay at home and were largely unable to do many of the activities that they derived meaning from. Since meaning is often related to mental health, these restrictions were likely to decrease mental health. The current study aimed to examine these effects and additionally benefit individuals' mental health by making their meaning salient. Specifically, the goal of the research was to design an intervention that could counter the potential negative effects of social distancing. We recruited a total of 96 U.S.A. residents (M age = 34.45, 92.7% Female) and assigned them to either the control group or to a meaning salience intervention. That is, participants either focused on the meaning of their daily activities (n = 45) or did not participate in any study-related activities during the week (n = 51). They completed various measures of mental health before and after this experimental period. Results suggested that the control group reported significantly greater anxiety, depression, and stress at the end of the week. In contrast, the experimental group reported less anxiety and trended toward less depression and stress at the end of that same week. In all, results suggest that simply focusing on one's daily activities and the meaning found in them protected people from the otherwise detrimental effects of the restrictions. This provides a promising and simple intervention that may assist both individuals and practitioners aiming to improve mental health, especially in challenging times.","Klussman, Kristine; Nichols, Austin Lee; Langer, Julia",Curr Psychol,,130

It presents six carefully selected manuscripts that reflect the ongoing conversation in our field about how the needs of the world’s most vulnerable populations can be served by the field’s values and paradigms. The reader will learn about collective symbolic coping, crisis management, barriers to and facilitators of supports and resources, mobilization of local networks of care, social toxicity and social possibility, coping strategies, affective impacts of confinement, the development of relationships between different social actors, the engagement of refugees and refugee-led organizations on the front lines of COVID-19, and even the buffering effects of gardening against the psychological impacts of isolation. Despite the grim reality of COVID-19, a thread of resilience, empowerment, and sense of community emerges loud and clear, and each manuscript is written with that same spirit and core tenet of community psychology that has always been our guiding light. During one of the most trying times of our lifetime, the need for a strong sense of community and mutual support will be a critical, if not determining, factor in how we continue to cope with this pandemic.

Nevertheless, it has not been reported as the cause of acute myocarditis or fulminant myocarditis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old male was admitted with pneumonia and cardiac symptoms. He was genetically confirmed as having COVID-19 according to sputum testing on the day of admission. He also had elevated troponin I (Trop I) level (up to 11.37 g/L) and diffuse myocardial dyskinesia along with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on echocardiography. The highest level of interleukin-6 was 272.40 pg/ml. Bedside chest radiographs showed typical ground-glass changes indicative of viral pneumonia. Laboratory test results for viruses that cause myocarditis were all negative. The patient conformed to the diagnostic criteria of the Chinese expert consensus statement for fulminant myocarditis. After receiving antiviral therapy and mechanical life support, Trop I was reduced to 0.10 g/L, and interleukin-6 was reduced to 7.63 pg/mL. Moreover, the LVEF of the patient gradually recovered to 68%. The patient died of aggravation of secondary infection on the 33rd day of hospitalization.

To date there are few reports of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) caused by type 1 myocardial infarction in patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the demographic, angiographic, and procedural characteristics alongside clinical outcomes of consecutive cases of COVID-19-positive patients with STEMI compared with COVID-19-negative patients. METHODS: This was a single-center, observational study of 115 consecutive patients admitted with confirmed STEMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention at Barts Heart Centre between March 1, 2020, and May 20, 2020. RESULTS: Patients with STEMI presenting with concurrent COVID-19 infection had higher levels of troponin T and lower lymphocyte count, but elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein. There were significantly higher rates of multivessel thrombosis, stent thrombosis, higher modified thrombus grade post first device with consequently higher use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and thrombus aspiration. Myocardial blush grade and left ventricular function were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19 with STEMI. Higher doses of heparin to achieve therapeutic activated clotting times were also noted. Importantly, patients with STEMI presenting with COVID-19 infection had a longer in-patient admission and higher rates of intensive care admission. CONCLUSIONS: In patients presenting with STEMI and concurrent COVID-19 infection, there is a strong signal toward higher thrombus burden and poorer outcomes. This supports the need for establishing COVID-19 status in all STEMI cases. Further work is required to understand the mechanism of increased thrombosis and the benefit of aggressive antithrombotic therapy in selected cases.","Choudry, Fizzah A; Hamshere, Stephen M; Rathod, Krishnaraj S; Akhtar, Mohammed M; Archbold, R Andrew; Guttmann, Oliver P; Woldman, Simon; Jain, Ajay K; Knight, Charles J; Baumbach, Andreas; Mathur, Anthony; Jones, Daniel A",J Am Coll Cardiol,,130

This beta coronavirus potentially infects the alveolar cells of the lung leading to pneumonia. The disease may progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome especially in elderly patients with comorbidities. Therefore, it is of interest to design and develop candidates for treatment, therapy and prevention. The spike glycoprotein of the virus known to potentially interact with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as a cell entry receptor is a suitable candidate for further consideration as vaccine and treatment candidate. Hence, we screened the spike protein of coronavirus-2 for potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes for further deliberation. Thus, we document several peptides on the spike protein with predicted high antigenicity, low allergenicity and good stability against selected proteases. The linear B-cell epitope with sequence 'GFNCYFPLQSYGF' is of particular interest in this context towards the design and development of short peptide vaccine candidates for combat and care against the virus.","Odhar, Hasanain Abdulhameed; Ahjel, Salam Waheed; Humadi, Suhad Sami",Bioinformation,,130

Several cutis laxa syndromes are inborn errors of metabolism and lead to severe neurological symptoms. PATIENT AND METHODS: In a patient with cutis laxa, a choreoathetoid movement disorder, dysmorphic features and intellectual disability we performed exome sequencing to elucidate the underlying genetic defect. We identified the amino acid substitution R275W in phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type II&#945;, caused by a homozygous missense mutation in the PI4K2A gene. We used lipidomics, complexome profiling and functional studies to measure phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate synthesis in the patient and evaluated PI4K2A deficient mice to define a novel metabolic disorder. RESULTS: The R275W residue, located on the surface of the protein, is involved in forming electrostatic interactions with the membrane. The catalytic activity of PI4K2A in patient fibroblasts was severely reduced and lipid mass spectrometry showed that particular acyl-chain pools of PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 were decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Phosphoinositide lipids play a major role in intracellular signalling and trafficking and regulate the balance between proliferation and apoptosis. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases such as PI4K2A mediate the first step in the main metabolic pathway that generates PI4P, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 . Although neurologic involvement is common, cutis laxa has not been reported previously in metabolic defects affecting signalling. Here we describe a patient with a complex neurological phenotype, premature aging and a mutation in PI4K2A, illustrating the importance of this enzyme in the generation of inositol lipids with particular acylation characteristics.

Antibiotic resistance was evaluated by microbiological examination of soft tissues' or bone's biopsy. RESULTS: Compared with 2019 group (n = 105), 2020 group (n = 120) had a significantly higher prevalence of antibiotic resistance [2019 vs 2020, 36% vs 63%, P <0.001] and more often was admitted with recent or current antibiotic therapy (18% vs 52%, P <0.001), which was frequently self-administered (5% vs 30%, P = 0.032). The risk of antibiotic resistance was also higher in 2020 group [OR 95% CI, 2.90 (1.68 to 4.99)].

Of 123,124 samples tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, 579 samples (407 positive and 172 negative) from 368 symptomatic non-hospitalised individuals with PCR-confirmed infection were included. Sample positivity rate was 61.5% (8/13) for pre-symptomatic samples, rising to 93.2% (317/340) for samples collected during the purported symptomatic infectious period (days 0-10 post-symptom onset), and dropping to 36.3% (82/226) for post-infectious period samples (day 11 onwards). URT viral load peaked shortly after symptom onset, with median Ct values ranging 20.00-29.99 until 15 days post-symptom onset, and >30.00 after this time. Of samples with a Ct value of <20.00, 96.1% were collected during the symptomatic infectious period. However, of samples with a Ct value &#8805;30.00 and &#8805;35.00, 46.9% and 18.5%, respectively, were also collected during the symptomatic infectious period. The findings of this study indicate that at or soon after symptom onset represents the optimum time to test for SARS-CoV-2 in the URT, with median Ct values suggesting the useful testing window extends until around 15 days post-symptom onset. In asymptomatic individuals or those with unknown dates of symptom onset, Ct values <20.00 imply recent onset/potential infectivity, but Ct values &#8805;30.00 or &#8805;35.00 do not exclude recent onset/potential infectivity. Individual sample Ct values should not be used as an absolute marker of length of time post-infection or to exclude infectivity where date of symptom onset is unavailable.","Fox-Lewis, Andrew; Fox-Lewis, Shivani; Beaumont, Jenna; Drinkovic, Dragana; Harrower, Jay; Howe, Kevin; Jackson, Catherine; Rahnama, Fahimeh; Shilton, Blair; Qiao, Helen; Smith, Kevin K; Morpeth, Susan C; Taylor, Susan; Blakiston, Matthew; Roberts, Sally; McAuliffe, Gary",Pathology,,130
345870,Cohort Profile: Multimorbidity in Children and Youth Across the Life-course (MY LIFE) Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) have found strong correlations between online searches and the epidemiology of the disease. AIM: Our aim was to determine if online searches for COVID-19 related to international media announcements or national epidemiology. METHODS: Searches for ""coronavirus"" were made on Google Trends from December 31, 2019 to April 13, 2020 for 40 European countries. The online COVID-19 searches for all countries were correlated with each other. COVID-10 epidemiology (i.e. incidence and mortality) was correlated with the national online searches. Major announcements by the World Health Organization (WHO) were taken into consideration with peaks in online searches. Correlations were made using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Overall, the online searches for COVID-19 were not correlated with the actual incidence and mortality of COVID-19. The mean Spearman correlation for incidence was 0.20 (range -0.66 to 0.76) and for mortality was 0.35 (range -0.75 to 0.85). Online searches in Europe were all strongly synchronized with each other; a mean Spearman correlation of 0.93 (range 0.62 to 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Online searches for COVID-19 in Europe are not correlated with epidemiology but strongly correlated with international WHO announcements. Our study challenges previous Google Trends studies and emphasizes the role of the WHO in raising awareness of a new disease.","Szmuda, Tomasz; Ali, Shan; Hetzger, Tarjei Vevang; Rosvall, Philip; Sloniewski, Pawel",Int J Infect Dis,,130

346207,"Comments on ""Factors Affecting the Psychological Well-being of Health Care Workers During an Epidemic: A Thematic Review""",2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 in December 2019 and reached Europe by late January 2020, when community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs) are at their annual peak. We validated the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended SARS-CoV-2 assay and analyzed the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and CARVs. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS) from 7663 patients were prospectively tested by the Basel S-gene and WHO-based E-gene (Roche) assays in parallel using the Basel N-gene assay for confirmation. CARVs were prospectively tested in 2394 NOPS by multiplex nucleic acid testing, including 1816 (75%) simultaneously for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The Basel S-gene and Roche E-gene assays were concordant in 7475 cases (97.5%) including 825 (11%) SARS-CoV-2 positives. In 188 (2.5%) discordant cases, SARS-CoV-2 loads were significantly lower than in concordant positive ones and confirmed in 105 (1.4%). Adults were more frequently SARS-CoV-2 positive, whereas children tested more frequently CARV positive. CARV coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 1.8%. SARS-CoV-2 replaced CARVs within 3 weeks, reaching 48% of all detected respiratory viruses followed by rhinovirus/enterovirus (13%), influenza virus (12%), coronavirus (9%), respiratory syncytial virus (6%), and metapneumovirus (6%). CONCLUSIONS: Winter CARVs were dominant during the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, impacting infection control and treatment decisions, but were rapidly replaced, suggesting competitive infection. We hypothesize that preexisting immune memory and innate immune interference contribute to the different SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology among adults and children.","Leuzinger, Karoline; Roloff, Tim; Gosert, Rainer; Sogaard, Kirstin; Naegele, Klaudia; Rentsch, Katharina; Bingisser, Roland; Nickel, Christian H; Pargger, Hans; Bassetti, Stefano; Bielicki, Julia; Khanna, Nina; Tschudin Sutter, Sarah; Widmer, Andreas; Hinic, Vladimira; Battegay, Manuel; Egli, Adrian; Hirsch, Hans H",J Infect Dis,,130

346985,Mental health care for international Chinese students affected by the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"Most unicellular organisms live in communities and express different phenotypes. Many efforts have been made to study the population dynamics of such complex communities of cells, coexisting as well-coordinated units. Minimal models based on ordinary differential equations are powerful tools that can help us understand complex phenomena. They represent an appropriate compromise between complexity and tractability; they allow a profound and comprehensive analysis, which is still easy to understand. Evolutionary game theory is another powerful tool that can help us understand the costs and benefits of the decision a particular cell of a unicellular social organism takes when faced with the challenges of the biotic and abiotic environment. This work is a binocular view at the population dynamics of such a community through the objectives of minimal modelling and evolutionary game theory. We test the behaviour of the community of a unicellular social organism at three levels of antibiotic stress. Even in the absence of the antibiotic, spikes in the fraction of resistant cells can be observed indicating the importance of bet hedging. At moderate level of antibiotic stress, we witness cyclic dynamics reminiscent of the renowned rock-paper-scissors game. At a very high level, the resistant type of strategy is the most favourable.","Garde, Ravindra; Ewald, Jan; Kovács, Ákos T; Schuster, Stefan",Open Biol,,130
347884,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and service delivery during pregnancy: Role of telepsychiatry,2020,"We analyzed the role of the RhoA/ROCK pathway in regulating endothelial dysfunction triggered by LPS and the protective effects of TSG (2, 3, 5, 4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-ß-D-glucoside). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with LPS at different concentrations or at different time points. Cells were also pretreated with 30 µM ROCK inhibitor Y27632 for 30 min or different concentrations of TSG for 24 h and then were incubated with 100 µg/ml LPS for another 24 h. The results showed that LPS treatment significantly reduced endothelial cell viability, increased LDH release, and promoted cell necrosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which was dramatically inhibited by TSG pretreatment. Furthermore, LPS induction significantly enhanced the expression of RhoA, ROCK1, and ROCK2 and the activation of ROCK; these effects were reduced by TSG pretreatment. The suppression of either RhoA or ROCK significantly improved LPS-induced endothelial cell viability, and reduced cell necrosis and LDH release. In addition, LPS treatment promoted F-actin skeleton rearrangement and contraction ring formation around the plasma membrane, which was greatly inhibited by the suppression of the RhoA/ROCK pathway or TSG pretreatment. In conclusion, TSG may inhibit F-actin cytoskeletal remodeling by blocking RhoA/ROCK signaling and thus reduce LPS-induced endothelial cell toxicity.","Qi, Yan; Liang, Xiuying; Hu, Xia; He, Haiyan; Tang, Lian; Yao, Wenjuan",Gen Physiol Biophys,,130

Therefore, in the present study, the effect of bifurcation on the manner of hemodynamic changes and the rupture risk of the small middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm is investigated. 3D anatomical models of the MCAs of 21 healthy subjects, 19 patients/IA/bifurcation, and 19 patients/IA were generated, and the models were analyzed by the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis. The presence of bifurcation in the pathway of the blood flow in the parent artery of healthy subjects has reduced the maximum velocity, flow rate, and wall shear stress (WSS) by 25.8%, 38.6%, and 11.1%, respectively. The bifurcation decreased the maximum velocity and flow rate in the neck and sac of the aneurysm by 1.65~2.1 times, respectively. It increased the maximum WSS, and phase lag between the WSS graph of healthy subjects and patients by 12.8%~13.9% and 10.2%~40.4%, respectively. The effect of bifurcation on the Womersley number change in the aneurysm was insignificant, and the blood flow was in the laminar flow condition in all samples. The results also showed bifurcation increased the phase lag between the flow rate and pressure gradient graphs up to approximately 1.5 times. The rupture prediction index for patients/IA/bifurcation and patients/IA was 62.1%(CV = 4.1) and 51.8%(CV = 4.4), respectively. Thus, in equal conditions, the presence of bifurcation increased the probability of the rupture of the aneurysm by 19.9%.","Gholampour, Seifollah; Mehrjoo, Saeed",Neurosurg. rev,,130

351375,Mental Health Burden of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Germany: Predictors of Mental Health Impairment,2020,"Since the first appearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) earlier this year, clinicians and researchers alike have been faced with dynamic, daily challenges of recognizing, understanding, and treating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2. Those who are moderately to severely ill with COVID-19 are likely to develop acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and require administration of supplemental oxygen. Assessing the need to initiate or titrate oxygen therapy is largely dependent on evaluating the patient's existing blood oxygenation status, either by direct arterial blood sampling or by transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation monitoring, also referred to as pulse oximetry. While the sampling of arterial blood for measurement of dissolved gases provides a direct measurement, it is technically challenging to obtain, is painful to the patient, and can be time and resource intensive. Pulse oximetry allows for non-invasive, real-time, continuous monitoring of the percent of hemoglobin molecules that are saturated with oxygen, and usually closely predicts the arterial oxygen content. As such, it was particularly concerning when patients with severe COVID-19 requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation within one of our intensive care units were observed to have significant discordance between their predicted arterial oxygen content via pulse oximetry and their actual measured oxygen content. We offer these preliminary observations along with our speculative causes as a timely, urgent clinical need. In the setting of a COVID-19 intensive care unit, entering a patient room to obtain a fresh arterial blood gas sample not only takes exponentially longer to do given the time required for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), it involves the consumption of already sparce PPE, and it increases the risk of viral exposure to the nurse, physician, or respiratory therapist entering the room to obtain the sample. As such, technology similar to pulse oximetry which can be applied to a patients finger, and then continuously monitored from outside the room is essential in preventing a particularly dangerous situation of unrealized hypoxia in this critically-ill patient population. Additionally, it would appear that conventional two-wavelength pulse oximetry may not accurately predict the arterial oxygen content of blood in these patients. This discordance of oxygenation measurements poses a critical concern in the evaluation and management of the acute hypoxemic respiratory failure seen in patients with COVID-19.","Rubano, Jerry A; Maloney, Lauren M; Simon, Jessica; Rutigliano, Daniel N; Botwinick, Isadora; Jawa, Randeep S; Shapiro, Marc J; Vosswinkel, James A; Talamini, Mark; Kaushansky, Kenneth",Ann. biomed. eng,,130

At most, if at all, a slightly increased risk can be derived from the previous case reports. In general, the risk of acute facial palsy is described in association with many vaccinations. The risk, if any, does not appear to be a specific risk of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. On the other hand, cases of acute facial palsy as symptom of a COVID-19 disease have also been described, so that the theoretical question arises as to the extent to which the vaccination may prevent rather than promote the occurrence of facial palsy. Ultimately, if acted quickly, acute facial paralysis can be treated well and its severity and sequelae cannot be compared with the severity of a COVID-19 disease and its possible long-COVID sequelae.","Volk, Gerd Fabian; Kuttenreich, Anna-Maria; Geitner, Maren; Guntinas-Lichius, Orlando",Laryngorhinootologie,,130

The result is a cycle of normoxia and hypoxia in which blood oxygen partial pressures can decline to <20-30 mmHg during a dive, a level considered injurious to oxygen-dependent human tissues (i.e., brain, heart). Safeguards in the form of enhanced on-board oxygen stores, selective oxygen transport, and unique tissue buffering capacities enable marine-adapted mammals to maintain physiological homeostasis and energy metabolism even when breathing and pulmonary gas exchange cease. This stands in stark contrast to the vulnerability of oxygen-sensitive tissues in humans that may undergo irreversible damage within minutes of ischemia and tissue hypoxia. Recently, these differences in protection against hypoxic injury have become evident in the systemic, multi-organ physiological failure during COVID-19 infection in humans. Prolonged recoveries in some patients have led to delays in the return to normal exercise levels and cognitive function even months later. Rather than a single solution to this problem, we find that marine mammals rely on a unique, integrative assemblage of protections to avoid the deleterious impacts of hypoxia on tissues. Built across evolutionary time, these solutions provide a natural template for identifying the potential for tissue damage when oxygen is lacking, and for guiding management decisions to support oxygen-deprived tissues in other mammalian species, including humans, challenged by hypoxia.","Williams, Terrie M; Davis, Randall W",Comp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol,,130
356896,Promoting Technology and Virtual Visits to Improve Older Adult Mental Health in the Face of COVID-19,2020,"Purpose: While it is particularly important that professional programs help teachers become members of a community of practice, especially in crisis situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a lack of research about strategies to effectively encourage the development of a community of practice and to support teachers’ transformation of their way of teaching. Thus, this paper aims to report on lessons learned from a blended professional development (PD) program for elementary and middle school teachers in Japan focused on computer programming education. In particular, the authors explored how application of the creative learning principles in the blended teacher PD may have helped to nurture a community of practice among teachers in Japan, and how the creative learning principles may be a valuable framework for designing online or blended teacher PD to support teachers’ transition into emergency remote education. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reports on the lessons learned from two iterations of blended teacher PD situated within a larger design-based research project on applying creative learning pedagogy in teacher PD. Creative learning is a learning approach focused on engagement in personally meaningful projects by tinkering with materials and learning from peers. A total of 26 teachers and coaches participated, all of whom work in elementary or middle schools across Nagano prefecture in Japan. Participant experiences were evaluated based on a pre-survey and a post-survey conducted before and after the in-person kick-off camp; observation notes taken; a final report submitted by each teacher; a debrief meeting at the end of the program; and semi-structured interviews with three selected participants after the program concluded. For this paper, the authors focus on two participants who fully and actively engaged in the program, and they introduce their stories to highlight the outcomes from the PD. Findings: The results highlight how a blended PD designed to support creative learning of teachers provided teachers with opportunities to gain help from other teachers and cultivate their expertise. The results also illustrated that how a community of practice emerged from the PD program, providing teachers with moral support when they tried new lesson designs. This paper offers several recommendations for designing professional learning experiences for instructional designers and professional developers that incorporate remote learning technologies. Originality/value: While an increased number of studies have shown the values of online and blended communities of practice for teacher PD, there are still limited insights on different strategies to support teachers in transforming their teaching practices. They generally do not provide teachers with opportunities to continue learning with and from one another beyond the program itself. This study examined the teachers’ experiences in a unique PD that implemented a creative learning approach into a blended learning environment for teachers.","Murai, Yumiko; Muramatsu, Hiroyuki",inform.Learn.Sci,,130

The three Landau coefficients , and as well as the bilinear coupling, , biquadratic coupling, and dielectric susceptibility, , were obtained as a function of enantiomeric excess. The chirality dependent bilinear coupling term vanishes as the chirality of the system tends to zero on approaching the racemic mixture. All other terms remain constant within the limits of error, providing experimental evidence that the bilinear coupling term is the only chirality dependent term of the generalised Landau model.","Archer, Paul; Dierking, Ingo; Hird, Michael",Soft Matter,,130

ART specialists are faced with dilemmas in light of the lack of concrete scientific evidence required to pave the way towards future safe practice. Meanwhile, infertile couples were similarly left in limbo unable to exercise their reproductive autonomy unlike fertile couples-where achieving a pregnancy via natural conception is a matter of decision. ART treatment being classified as non-essential has only recently re-started, facing new challenges while enabling pregnancy at a time of uncertainty. This article highlights matters of bioethical nature to be considered in the ART world at the time of COVID-19 while presenting an all-inclusive critique of the current status. When pursuing pregnancy through IVF treatment during the pandemic, distancing and caution have the lead role in an effort to defend the health of the intended parents and future children. To promote patient autonomy along with our ethical, moral, and legal duty towards our patients, emphasis should be given on ascertaining shared decision-making, and ensuring that an appropriate all-inclusive informed consent is signed prior to initiating any IVF treatment.","Simopoulou, Mara; Sfakianoudis, Konstantinos; Giannelou, Polina; Rapani, Anna; Siristatidis, Charalampos; Bakas, Panagiotis; Vlahos, Nikolaos; Pantos, Konstantinos",J Assist Reprod Genet,,130

METHODS: HCWs at a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul, South Korea, received a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) or an mRNA-based vaccine (BNT162b2) between March 5 and March 26, 2021. The HCWs were asked to report adverse reactions through a mobile self-report questionnaire for three days after vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 7,625 HCWs received the first dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccine during the study period. Of them, 5,866 (76.9%) HCWs (ChAdOx1, n = 5,589 [95.3%]; BNT162b2, n = 277 [4.7%]) participated at least once in the survey, of whom 77% were female and 86% were younger than 50 years. The overall adverse reaction rate was 93% in the ChAdOx1 group and 80% in the BNT162b2 group (P < 0.001). Both local and systemic reactions were more commonly reported in the ChAdOx1 group, and the difference was larger in systemic reactions such as fever and fatigue. In the ChAdOx1 group, the incidence of adverse reactions was significantly higher in females and those in the younger age groups, while the BNT162b2 group showed such difference according to age. CONCLUSION: In our prospective survey, vaccine-associated adverse reactions were more commonly reported in the ChAdOx1 group than in the BNT162b2 group. Females and younger age groups experienced vaccine-associated adverse reactions more frequently.","Bae, Seongman; Lee, Yun Woo; Lim, So Yun; Lee, Ji Hyang; Lim, Joon Seo; Lee, Sojeong; Park, Soyeon; Kim, Sun Kyung; Lim, Young Ju; Kim, Eun Ok; Jung, Jiwon; Kwon, Hyouk Soo; Kim, Tae Bum; Kim, Sung Han",J Korean Med Sci,,130
358908,Chasing Your Long Tails: Differentially Private Prediction in Health Care Settings,2020-10-13,"The COVID-19 pandemic presents global challenges transcending boundaries of country, race, religion, and economy. The current gold standard method for COVID-19 detection is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. However, this method is expensive, time-consuming, and violates social distancing. Also, as the pandemic is expected to stay for a while, there is a need for an alternate diagnosis tool which overcomes these limitations, and is deployable at a large scale. The prominent symptoms of COVID-19 include cough and breathing difficulties. We foresee that respiratory sounds, when analyzed using machine learning techniques, can provide useful insights, enabling the design of a diagnostic tool. Towards this, the paper presents an early effort in creating (and analyzing) a database, called Coswara, of respiratory sounds, namely, cough, breath, and voice. The sound samples are collected via worldwide crowdsourcing using a website application. The curated dataset is released as open access. As the pandemic is evolving, the data collection and analysis is a work in progress. We believe that insights from analysis of Coswara can be effective in enabling sound based technology solutions for point-of-care diagnosis of respiratory infection, and in the near future this can help to diagnose COVID-19.","Sharma, Neeraj; Krishnan, Prashant; Kumar, Rohit; Ramoji, Shreyas; Chetupalli, Srikanth Raj; Nirmala, R.; Ghosh, Prasanta Kumar; Ganapathy, Sriram",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10548v1.pdf,130

Among them, 78 were the first cases of a household, with 174 household contacts. Of the 174 contacts, 21 contracted infection, indicating a secondary attack rate of 12.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.6-17.9%). No significant differences were observed in the demographics and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test results between first cases who became the source of infection to the household members or not. The secondary attack rates per various characteristics of the household members were significantly different: aged > 69 years (40.9% [95% CI 20.7-63.6%]) and those with underlying diseases (36.0% [95% CI 18.0-57.5%]). When the period from the onset to the isolation of the first household case was within 3 days, the secondary attack rate was low (4.5% [95% CI 0.1-22.8%]). Among the 21 secondary cases, 11 (52.4%) developed within 5 days from symptom onset in the first case within the same household. This indicates that secondary infection within the household occurred immediately after symptom onset in the first case. Thus, isolation of a suspected patient is a solution to reduce secondary household infections.","Kuba, Yumani; Shingaki, Ayako; Nidaira, Minoru; Kakita, Tetsuya; Maeshiro, Noriyuki; Oyama, Minori; Kudeken, Tsuyoshi; Miyagi, Ayano; Yamauchi, Miyuki; Kyan, Hisako",Jpn. j. infect. dis,,130

Regarding a lack of information about perception of nursing students, as a part of healthcare workers, in this issue, the current study was aimed to explore the perceived consequences of self-medication from the perspective of nursing students. Methods: This qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured individual face-to-face interviews. Purposeful sampling method was used for selection of participants. Twelve nursing students in the age range of 21-36 years were enrolled. Five participants were male and seven were female, seven master's degree and five were undergraduate of bachelor degree. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analyzed as content analyses. Results: Two categories and seven sub-categories were emerged from the data analysis. The main categories included; positive consequences and negative consequences, and subcategories included; time saving, cost savings, disease treatment, harming the health system, drug resistance, physical complications and death. Conclusion: The participants believed that self-medication has some positive and negative consequences in viewpoints of nursing students. Regarding, Self-medication that potentially has dangerous consequences, it is suggested the students will be educated and warned about the adverse effects of self-medication, and the nursing teachers should try to rectify students' misconceptions about self-medication.","Khatony, Alireza; Soroush, Ali; Andayeshgar, Bahare; Abdi, Alireza",BMC Nurs,,130

The analytical results proposed the isolation of mononuclear (Sr+2&Ba+2) and binuclear complexes (Mg+2&Ca+2). These complexes were analyzed by available analytical and spectral techniques. The tetrahedral geometry was suggested for all complexes (SP3) through bidentate binding mode of ligand with each central atom. UV-Vis spectra reveal the influence of LâM charge transfer and the estimated optical band gap mostly appeared close to that for known semiconductors. XRD, SEM and TEM studies were executed for new complexes and reflects the nano-crystallinity and homogeneous morphology. The structural forms of ATA and its complexes were optimized by DFT/B3LYP under 6-31G and LANL2DZ basis sets. The output files (log, chk &fchk) were visualized on program screen and according to numbering scheme, many physical features were obtained. It is worthy to note that, a virtual simulation for the inhibition affinity towards COVID-19 proteins as proactive study before the actual application, was done for ATA and its complexes. This was done in addition to drugs currently applied in curing (Hydroxychloroquine & Lopinavir), for comparison and recommendation. Drug-likeness parameters were obtained to evaluate the optimal pharmacokinetics to ensure efficacy. Furthermore, simulated inhibition for COVID-19 cell-growth, was conducted by MOE-docking module. The negative allosteric binding mode represents good inhibitory behavior of ATA, Ba(II)-ATA complex and Lopinavir only. All interaction outcomes of Hydroxychloroquine drug reflect unsuitability of this drug in treating COVID-19. On the other hand, there is optimism for ATA and Lopinvir behaviors in controlling COVID-19 proliferation.","Refat, Moamen; Sedayo, Anas A; Sayqal, Ali; Alharbi, Arwa; Katouah, Hanadi A; Abumelha, Hana M; Alzahrani, Seraj; Alkhatib, Fatmah; Althagafi, Ismail; El-Metwaly, Nashwa",Inorg Chem Commun,,130

Recently, there have been several promising advances in male contraceptive research. This review will update readers on recent research in both hormonal and nonhormonal approaches to male contraception. Hormonal approaches to male contraception have been stymied by adverse effects, formulations requiring injections or implants, a 5% to10% nonresponse rate, as well as poor understanding of user acceptability. In the last several years, research has focused on novel, orally bioavailable androgens such as dimethandrolone undecanoate and 11ß-methyl-19-nor-testosterone. Additionally, combinations of a topical testosterone gel combined with a gel containing segesterone acetate, a potent progestin, have shown promise in clinical trials recently. Simultaneously, significant preclinical progress has been made in several approaches to nonhormonal male contraceptives, including compounds that inhibit sperm motility such as eppin, compounds that inhibit retinoic acid binding or biosynthesis, and reversible approaches to obstruction of the vas deferens. It is imperative for these areas of research to continue making strides so that there is a gamut of contraceptive options for couples to choose from. Some of these approaches will hopefully reach clinical utility soon, greatly improving contraceptive choice for couples.","Thirumalai, Arthi; Amory, John K",Fertil. steril,,130

The drop in the percentage of active individuals with or without medication occurred when comparing the scenarios before and during quarantine. However, the difference in the prevalence of active individuals between the groups was significant, showing that the group with medication remained more active. The fear of contamination, the measures of distance and the lack of adherence of the population to classes by videoconference reduced the frequency of physical activities in the general sample population. However, people who used medication showed greater concern about the practice of physical activity to optimize treatment.

The current case series examines the immediate short-term outcomes of seven heart transplant recipients transplanted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We hope to illustrate that with proper preparation, planning, and testing, heart transplantation can be continued during a pandemic. We assessed 7 patients transplanted from March 4, 2020, to April 15, 2020. The following endpoints were noted: in-hospital survival, in-hospital freedom from rejection, in-hospital nonfatal major cardiac adverse events (NF-MACE), severe primary graft dysfunction, hospital length of stay, and ICU length of stay. There were no expirations throughout the hospital admission. In addition, there were no patients with NF-MACE or treated rejection, and 1 patient developed severe primary graft dysfunction. Average length of stay was 17.2 days with a standard deviation of 5.9 days. ICU length of stay was 7.7 days with a standard deviation of 2.3 days. Despite the decreasing trend in completed heart transplants due to SARS-CoV-2, heart transplantation appears to be feasible in the immediate short term. Further follow-up is needed, however, to assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on post-heart transplant outcomes months after transplantation.","Esmailian, Gabriel; Kobashigawa, Jon A; Nishihara, Keith; Patel, Jignesh K; Czer, Lawrence; Megna, Dominick; Emerson, Dominic; Ramzy, Danny; Trento, Alfredo; Chikwe, Joanna; Esmailian, Fardad",Clin Transplant,,130

METHODS: A total of 233 patients were admitted to Emergency Department (ED) of Pamukkale University Hospital during two months (March-April 2020) and underwent Sars CoV-2 PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), complete blood count (CBC), and CRP tests in sequence due to complaints of COVID-19. The laboratory results and demographic findings were collected from the public health management system retrospectively. The patients with positive Sars CoV-2 PCR test along with hospitalization data were also recorded. RESULTS: The CRP (p = 0.0001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.038), PLR (p = 0.0001) and NLR (p = 0.001) remained significantly higher in the patients with positive Sars CoV-2 PCR test result. By contrast, eosinophil (p = 0.0001), lymphocyte (p = 0.0001), platelet levels (p = 0.0001) were calculated as significantly higher in negative Sars CoV-2 patients. CONCLUSION: In the light of the obtained results, the CRP, LDH, PLR and NLR levels remained significantly higher in COVID-19 positive patients, while eosinophil, lymphocyte, and platelet levels were significantly elevated in COVID-19 negative patients.","Seyit, Murat; Avci, Esin; Nar, Rukiye; Senol, Hande; Yilmaz, Atakan; Ozen, Mert; Oskay, Alten; Aybek, Hulya",Am. j. emerg. med,,130

Physical, clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics, treatment, and outcome data were abstracted. Patients who were obese [body mass index (BMI) &#8805;28âkg/m], underweight (BMIâ<â18.5âkg/m), under 18 years old, pregnant, or still in hospital were excluded. Disease severity was classified as moderate or severe pneumonia based on the World Health Organization interim guidance. Overweight was defined as BMI &#8805;24âkg/m and <28âkg/m. Patients were followed for discharge or death through April 10, 2020. We used logistic regression models to identify risk factors for severe disease, Cox proportional hazard models to explore associations between medications and patient outcomes (discharge or in-hospital death), and Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression models to evaluate risk factors for in-hospital death.One-half of patients (120, 50.0%) had severe pneumonia, while nearly one-half (114, 47.5%) were overweight. Among patients over 45 years old, overweight patients had significantly lower rates of fatigue, higher rates of headache, and higher median C-reactive protein levels. Patients under 45 years old had higher rates of cough and myalgia and higher proportions of increased alanine aminotransferase and lactic dehydrogenase, as well as more pulmonary lobes involved in the pneumonia revealed by chest computed tomography scans. Overweight patients were at higher risk of developing severe pneumonia. Although weight was not a risk factor for in-hospital death, overweight patients showed different responses to medications compared with normal weight patients. Intravenous interferon-&#945;, intravenous glucocorticoids, and antifungal drugs were associated with reduced mortality in overweight patients. Intravenous immunoglobulin, oseltamivir, and ribavirin were associated with reduced mortality in normal weight patients.Overweight is a worldwide health problem. We found overweight to be related to the COVID-19 severity but not to in-hospital death. Clinicians should be aware that overweight COVID-19 patients require increased attention for different clinical features and treatment response.","Rao, Xinrui; Wu, Chuangyan; Wang, Sihua; Tong, Song; Wang, Geng; Wu, Gang; Zhou, Rui",Medicine (Baltimore),,130

METHODS: We employed a set of combined ultrasound parameters and histopathological images obtained simultaneously in 28 patients (15 women, 0.6-83 years) with fatal COVID-19 submitted to minimally invasive autopsies, with different times of disease evolution from initial symptoms to death (3-37 days, median 18 days). For each patient, we analysed eight post-mortem LUS parameters and the proportion of three histological patterns (normal lung, exudative diffuse alveolar damage [DAD] and fibroproliferative DAD) in eight different lung regions. The relationship between histopathological and post-mortem ultrasonographic findings was assessed using various statistical approaches. RESULTS: Statistically significant positive correlations were observed between fibroproliferative DAD and peripheral consolidation (coefficient 0.43, p = 0.02) and pulmonary consolidation (coefficient 0.51, p = 0.005). A model combining age, time of evolution, sex and ultrasound score predicted reasonably well (r = 0.66) the proportion of pulmonary parenchyma with fibroproliferative DAD. CONCLUSION: The present study adds information to previous studies related to the use of LUS as a tool to assess the severity of acute pulmonary damage. We provide a histological background that supports the concept that LUS can be used to characterize the progression and severity of lung damage in severe COVID-19.","de Almeida Monteiro, Renata Aparecida; Duarte-Neto, Amaro Nunes; Ferraz da Silva, Luiz Fernando; de Oliveira, Ellen Pierre; do Nascimento, Ellen Caroline Toledo; Mauad, Thais; Saldiva, Paulo Hilário do Nascimento; Dolhnikoff, Marisa",Intensive Care Med,,130
377210,Further Adaptations and Reflections by an Assertive Community Treatment Team to Serve Clients with Severe Mental Illness During COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Awake prone positioning (APP) might benefit patients with COVID-19 by improving oxygenation, but it is unknown whether this improvement can be sustained with serial proning episodes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of adults with COVID-19 admitted to one intensive care unit, in those who underwent APP and controls. Patients in both groups had type 1 respiratory failure requiring oxygen (but not initially intubated), confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR by nasopharyngeal swab and findings of multifocal ground-glass opacities on imaging. For the APP group, serial SpO2/FiO2 measurements were recorded after each proning episode. RESULTS: Of 77 patients admitted, 50 (65%) were excluded because they had already been intubated. Another 7 (9%) had undergone APP prior to admission. Of the remaining 20, 10 underwent APP and 10 were controls. Patients in both groups had similar demographics, subsequent intubation and survival. Of those who underwent APP, SpO2/FiO2 was most likely to increase after the first episode (before median: 152, IQR 135-185; after: median 192, IQR 156-234, p=0.04). Half of participants (5) in the APP group were unable to tolerate more than two APP episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care are not suitable for APP. Of those who are, many cannot tolerate more than two episodes. Improvements in SpO2/FiO2 secondary to APP are transient and most likely in the first episode. Our findings may explain why other studies have failed to show improvements in mortality from APP despite improvements in oxygenation.","Barker, Joseph; Pan, Daniel; Koeckerling, David; Baldwin, Alexander James; West, Raha",Postgrad. med. j,,130
378052,COVID-19 mass vaccination involves unusual venues,2021,"In this study, we used an integrative computational approach to examine molecular mechanisms and determine functional signatures underlying the role of functional residues in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are targeted by novel mutational variants and antibody-escaping mutations. Atomistic simulations and functional dynamics analysis are combined with alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with the ACE2 host receptor and the REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail(REG10987+REG10933). Using alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity analysis, we have shown that K417, E484, and N501 residues correspond to key interacting centers with a significant degree of structural and energetic plasticity that allow mutants in these positions to afford the improved binding affinity with ACE2. Through perturbation-based network modeling and community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with ACE2, we demonstrate that E406, N439, K417, and N501 residues serve as effector centers of allosteric interactions and anchor major intermolecular communities that mediate long-range communication in the complexes. The results provide support to a model according to which mutational variants and antibody-escaping mutations constrained by the requirements for host receptor binding and preservation of stability may preferentially select structurally plastic and energetically adaptable allosteric centers to differentially modulate collective motions and allosteric interactions in the complexes with the ACE2 enzyme and REGN-COV2 antibody combination. This study suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may function as a versatile and functionally adaptable allosteric machine that exploits the plasticity of allosteric regulatory centers to fine-tune response to antibody binding without compromising the activity of the spike protein.","Verkhivker, Gennady M; Agajanian, Steve; Oztas, Deniz Yazar; Gupta, Grace",Biochemistry,,130

For these reasons, active administration of anticoagulants (such as heparin) is recommended to patients with severe COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of different doses of low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on severe COVID-19 patients. Methods: This study was performed retrospectively in intensive care unit of a tertiary referral hospital. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) positive (+) patients were included in the study. Patients’ demographic data, length of stay in the hospital and intensive care unit, laboratory values (D-dimer, CRP, creatinine) on the last day of intensive care stay, mortality and invasive mechanical ventilator needs were recorded. Group O: consisted of patients not receiving anticoagulants, and Group 1 received a single daily dose of 40 mg enoxaparin sodium (equivalent to 4000 anti-Xa IU), and Group 2 received 2 daily doses of 1 mg/kg enoxaparin sodium. Results: A total of 191 patients were included in the study. 45% of the patients were female (n: 86), 55% were male. The mean age was found to be 67.6 ± 13.8.

381293,Experiences of commercial sex workers during COVID-19 restrictions in selected metropolises in Ghana,2020,"Intermediate host species provide a crucial link in the emergence of zoonotic infectious diseases, serving as a population where an emerging pathogen can mutate to become human-transmissible. Identifying such species is thus a key component of predicting and possibly mitigating future epidemics. Despite this importance, intermediate host species have not been investigated in much detail, and have generally only been identified by testing for the presence of pathogens in multiple candidate species. In this paper, we present a mathematical model able to identify likely intermediate host species for emerging zoonoses based on ecological data for the candidates and epidemiological data for the pathogen. Since coronaviruses frequently emerge through intermediate host species and, at the time of writing, pose an urgent pandemic threat, we apply the model to the three emerging coronaviruses of the twenty-first century, accurately predicting palm civets as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-1 and dromedary camels as intermediate hosts for MERS. Further, we suggest mink, pangolins, and ferrets as intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2. With the capacity to evaluate intermediate host likelihood among different species, researchers can focus testing for possible infection sources and interventions more effectively.","Royce, Katherine",J Theor Biol,,130

Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) has been proposed to serve as the receptor for the entry of 2019-nCoV, which is the same as that for the severe acute respiratory syndrome. This study aimed to investigate the possible cause of kidney damage and the potential route of 2019-nCoV infection in the urinary system. METHODS: We used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data and new independent kidney single-cell RNA sequencing data generated in-house to evaluate ACE2 gene expression in all cell types in healthy kidneys and bladders. The Pearson correlation coefficients between ACE2 and all other genes were first generated. Then, genes with r values larger than 0.1 and P values smaller than 0.01 were deemed significant co-expression genes with ACE2. RESULTS: Our results showed the enriched expression of ACE2 in all subtypes of proximal tubule (PT) cells of the kidney. ACE2 expression was found in 5.12%, 5.80%, and 14.38% of the proximal convoluted tubule cells, PT cells, and proximal straight tubule cells, respectively, in three published kidney cell atlas datasets. In addition, ACE2 expression was also confirmed in 12.05%, 6.80%, and 10.20% of cells of the proximal convoluted tubule, PT, and proximal straight tubule, respectively, in our own two healthy kidney samples. For the analysis of public data from three bladder samples, ACE2 expression was low but detectable in bladder epithelial cells. Only 0.25% and 1.28% of intermediate cells and umbrella cells, respectively, had ACE2 expression. CONCLUSION: This study has provided bioinformatics evidence of the potential route of 2019-nCoV infection in the urinary system.","Lin, Wei; Fan, Jue; Hu, Long-Fei; Zhang, Yan; Ooi, Joshua D; Meng, Ting; Jin, Peng; Ding, Xiang; Peng, Long-Kai; Song, Lei; Tang, Rong; Xiao, Zhou; Ao, Xiang; Xiao, Xiang-Cheng; Zhou, Qiao-Ling; Xiao, Ping; Zhong, Yong",Chin Med J (Engl),,130
382416,The effect of remote learning on the mental health of first year university students in Japan,2021,"Objective To assess willingness for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine and identify the factors attributing to the willingness. Design A cross-sectional study was conducted, adopting an exponential, non-discriminative snowball sampling technique. The questionnaire collected the socio-demographic profile, history of COVID-19 infection, presence of co-morbidities (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cancer), willingness, and preference of vaccine among participants. An online platform (Google Forms) was used to collect data from all over India. A total of 2032 Indian adults aged above 18 years were included in the study. Results Around 1598 (78.6%) expressed willingness to receive the COVID vaccine, and among the healthcare providers (HCPs), 579 (80.3%) were willing for COVID vaccination. Factors like the belief that the vaccine is necessary (aOR=1.68, 95% CI =1.34 to 2.11), respondents having no history of COVID infection (aOR=0.71, 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.97), having trust in the government (aOR=6.09, CI: 4.59 to 7.98), people who felt the cost of the vaccine didn't matter (aOR=4.92, CI: 3.80 to 6.37), and respondents with no perceived risk of COVID infection (aORKI.63;CI: 0.47 to 0.83) were more associated with willingness for COVID vaccination. Conclusions An effective vaccine should be well-received by the public. The responsibility lies with the government, health authorities, and manufacturers to take appropriate steps to dispel rumors in order to ensure people's understanding and acceptance.","Jacob, J.; Stephen, S.; Issac, A.; Krishnan, N.; Radhakrishnan, R.

In this study, we examine how maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma history relate to mothers' beliefs and intentions about the COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children. METHODS: A total of 240 mothers with a mental health history participating in a parenting study answered online survey questions via Prolific. Questions assessed: (a) trauma indictors (past diagnosis, current symptoms, and lifetime exposure to events); (b) vaccine measures (intentions for self and child, COVID-19 vaccine confidence, general vaccine perceived safety, reasoning about vaccine intentions, sources of influence on intentions); and (c) possible explanatory variables (institutional distrust, negative worldviews). ANCOVAs and regression analyses were used. RESULTS: When compared with mothers with other mental health diagnoses, mothers with a PTSD history had significantly less confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and less intent to get the vaccine for themselves or their child. These effects were explained by greater institutional distrust (i.e., significant indirect effects). Mothers with a previous PTSD diagnosis also expressed different reasons for vaccine hesitancy (e.g., less belief in science) and ascribed less influence to healthcare and governmental sources in vaccine decision-making. CONCLUSION: Findings highlight the potential utility of a trauma-informed approach in efforts to reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. For mothers with a history of PTSD, addressing institutional distrust, including towards the healthcare industry, may be an important element to consider in the content, delivery, and mode of vaccine messaging.","Milan, Stephanie; Dáu, Ana Luísa B T",J. pediatr. psychol,,130

METHODS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients and age- and sex-matched healthy controls were studied. Platelet and leukocyte activation, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a neutrophil-released enzyme, were measured. Four patients were re-studied after recovery. The activating effect of COVID-19 plasma on control platelets and leukocytes and the inhibiting activity of common antithrombotic agents on it were studied. RESULTS: 36 COVID-19 patients and 31 healthy controls were studied; 8/36 COVID-19 patients (22.2%) developed VTE. Platelets and neutrophils were activated in COVID-19 patients. NET, but not platelet activation, biomarkers correlated with disease severity and were associated with thrombosis. Plasmatic MMP-9 was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients.Platelet and neutrophil activation markers, but less so NETs, normalized after recovery.In vitro, plasma from COVID-19 patients triggered platelet and neutrophil activation and NET formation, the latter blocked by therapeutic dose low-molecular weight heparin, but not by aspirin or dypiridamole. CONCLUSIONS: Platelet and neutrophil activation are key features of COVID-19 patients. NET biomarkers may help to predict clinical worsening and VTE, and may guide LMWH-treatment intensity.","Petito, E; Falcinelli, E; Paliani, U; Cesari, E; Vaudo, G; Sebastiano, M; Cerotto, V; Guglielmini, G; Gori, F; Malvestiti, M; Becattini, C; Paciullo, F; De Robertis, E; Bury, L; Lazzarini, T; Gresele, P",J. infect. dis,,130

That it was possible to develop multiple COVID-19 vaccines in less than a year, while at the same time fostering extreme inequities, calls for transformative change in the health innovation and access ecosystem. Brought into the spotlight through the AIDS drugs access crisis, challenges in accessing lifesaving medicines and vaccines-because they are either not available or inaccessible due to excessive pricing-are being faced by people all over the world. To appreciate the underlying framing of current access discussions, it is important to understand past trends in global health policies and the thinking behind the institutions and mechanisms that were designed to solve access problems. Contrary to what might be expected, certain types of solutions intrinsically carry the conditions that enable scarcity, rationing, and inequity, and lead us away from ensuring the right to health. Analyzing the root causes of access problems and the political economy that allows them to persist and even become exacerbated is necessary to fix access inequities today and to design better solutions to ensure equitable access to health technologies in the future.","Krikorian, G.; Torreele, E.",Health &amp; Human Rights,,130

METHODS: Prospective, population-based study including pregnant women consecutively attended at first/second trimester or at delivery at three hospitals in Barcelona, Spain. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and IgM/IgA) were measured in all participants and nasopharyngeal RT-PCR was performed at delivery. The primary outcome was a composite of pregnancy complications in SARS-CoV-2 positive versus negative women: miscarriage, preeclampsia, preterm delivery, perinatal death, small-for-gestational age, neonatal admission. Secondary outcomes were components of the primary outcome plus abnormal fetal growth, malformation, intrapartum fetal distress. Outcomes were also compared between positive symptomatic and positive asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 women. RESULTS: Of 2,225 pregnant women, 317 (14.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (n=314, 99.1%) and/or RT-PCR (n=36, 11.4%). Among positive women, 217 (68.5%) were asymptomatic, 93 (29.3%) had mild COVID-19 and 7 (2.2%) pneumonia, of which 3 required intensive care unit admission.

However, peptide therapeutic usage is hindered by delivery-related challenges, meaning that their formulations must be altered to overcome these limitations. This process could be propelled by applying microfluidics (MFs) due to its highly controllable and adaptable attributes;however, therapeutic research within this field is extremely limited. Peptides possess multifunctional roles within therapeutic formulations, ranging from enhancing target specificity to acting as the active component of the medicine. Diagnostically, MFs are well explored in the field of peptides, as MFs provide an unsullied platform to provide fast yet accurate examinations. The capacity to add attributes, such as integrated sensors and microwells, to the MF chip, only enhances the attractiveness of MFs as a diagnostic platform. The structural individuality of peptides makes them prime candidates for diagnostic purposes, for example, antigen detection and isolation. Therefore, this review provides a useful insight into the current applications of MFs for peptide-based therapy and diagnostics and highlights potential gaps in the field that are yet to be explored or optimized.","Weaver, Edward Uddin Shahid Cole David K.; Hooker, Andrew Lamprou Dimitrios A.",Applied Sciences,,130

392291,COVID-19 epidemic and public mental health care in Italy: ethical considerations,2020,"Objectives: An outbreak of the novel coronavirus in December 2019 caused a worldwide pandemic. This disease also impacts European countries, including Germany. Without effective medicines or vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions are the best strategy to reduce the number of cases. Study design: A deterministic model was simulated to evaluate the number of infectious and healthcare demand. Method: Using an age-structured SEIR model for the COVID-19 transmission, we project the COVID-19-associated demand for hospital and ICU beds within Germany. We estimated the effectiveness of different control measures, including active case-finding and quarantining of asymptomatic persons, self-isolation of people who had contact with an infectious person, and physical distancing, as well as a combination of these control measures. Results: We found that contact tracing could reduce the peak of ICU beds as well as mass testing. The time delay between diagnosis and self-isolation influences the control measures. Physical distancing to limit the contact rate would delay the peak of the outbreak, which results in the demand for ICU beds being below the capacity during the early outbreak. Conclusions: Our study analyzed several scenarios in order to provide policymakers that face the pandemic of COVID-19 with insights into the different measures available. We highlight that the individuals who have had contact with a virus-positive person must be quarantined as soon as possible to reduce contact with possible infectious cases and to reduce transmission. Keeping physical distance and having fewer contacts should be implemented to prevent overwhelming ICU demand.","Chadsuthi, Sudarat; Modchang, Charin",Public Health Pract (Oxf),,130

Control of the spread of COVID-19 in emergency situations across the world is a challenge and therefore the aim of this study is to propose a q-linear Diophantine fuzzy decision-making model for the control and diagnose COVID19. Basically, the paper includes three main parts for the achievement of appropriate and accurate measures to address the situation of emergency decision-making. First, we propose a novel generalization of Pythagorean fuzzy set, q-rung orthopair fuzzy set and linear Diophantine fuzzy set, called q-linear Diophantine fuzzy set (q-LDFS) and also discussed their important properties. In addition, aggregation operators play an effective role in aggregating uncertainty in decision-making problems. Therefore, algebraic norms based on certain operating laws for q-LDFSs are established. In the second part of the paper, we propose series of averaging and geometric aggregation operators based on defined operating laws under q-LDFS. The final part of the paper consists of two ranking algorithms based on proposed aggregation operators to address the emergency situation of COVID-19 under q-linear Diophantine fuzzy information. In addition, the numerical case study of the novel carnivorous (COVID-19) situation is provided as an application for emergency decision-making based on the proposed algorithms. Results explore the effectiveness of our proposed methodologies and provide accurate emergency measures to address the global uncertainty of COVID-19.","Almagrabi, Alaa O; Abdullah, Saleem; Shams, Maria; Al-Otaibi, Yasser D; Ashraf, Shahzaib",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,,130

397163,Paying Attention to the Measures Used in Psychiatric Research and Services,2021,"AIM: SARS-CoV-2 infection has been divided by scientific opinion into three phases: the first as asymptomatic or slightly symptomatic and the second and the third with greater severity, characterized by a hyperinflammatory and fibrotic state, responsible for lung lesions, in some cases fatal. The development of antiviral drugs directed against SARS-CoV-2 and effective vaccines is progressing; meanwhile, the best pharmacological objective is related to the management of all the complications caused by this viral infection, mainly controlling the inflammatory and fibrotic state and preventing the infection from moving into the most serious phases. SUBJECT AND METHOD: Describe the scientific rationale related to the use of an antifibrotic therapy with pirfenidone, as monotherapy and/or in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs to manage and control complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Based on the scientific literature and epidemiological results and considering the pathophysiological, biological, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, an antifibrotic drug such as pirfenidone as monotherapy or in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs can be (acting early, at the right doses and at the right time) therapeutically effective to avoid serious complications during viral infection. The same approach can also be effective as postinfection therapy in patients with residual pulmonary fibrotic damage. Management of inflammation and fibrotic status with a combination therapy of pirfenidone and IL-6 or IL-1 inhibitors could represent a pharmacological synergy with added value. CONCLUSION: In this article, we consider the role of antifibrotic therapy with pirfenidone in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection on going or in the stage of postinfection with pulmonary fibrotic consequences. The scientific rationale for its use is also described.","Ferrara, Francesco; Granata, Giovanni; Pelliccia, Chiara; La Porta, Raffaele; Vitiello, Antonio",Eur. j. clin. pharmacol,,130
398381,Understanding the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of Transgender and Gender Nonbinary Individuals Engaged in a Longitudinal Cohort Study,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) is the pathogenic coronavirus responsible for the global pandemic of COVID-19 disease. The Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 attaches to host lung epithelial cells through the cell surface receptor ACE2, a process dependent on host proteases including TMPRSS2. Here, we identify small molecules that reduce surface expression of TMPRSS2 using a library of 2,560 FDA-approved or current clinical trial compounds. We identify homoharringtonine and halofuginone as the most attractive agents, reducing endogenous TMPRSS2 expression at sub-micromolar concentrations. These effects appear to be mediated by a drug-induced alteration in TMPRSS2 protein stability. We further demonstrate that halofuginone modulates TMPRSS2 levels through proteasomal-mediated degradation that involves the E3 ubiquitin ligase component DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 1 (DCAF1). Finally, cells exposed to homoharringtonine and halofuginone, at concentrations of drug known to be achievable in human plasma, demonstrate marked resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection in both live and pseudoviral in vitro models. Given the safety and pharmacokinetic data already available for the compounds identified in our screen, these results should help expedite the rational design of human clinical trials designed to combat active COVID-19 infection.","Chen, Yanwen; Lear, Travis B; Evankovich, John W; Larsen, Mads B; Lin, Bo; Alfaras, Irene; Kennerdell, Jason R; Salminen, Laura; Camarco, Daniel P; Lockwood, Karina C; Tuncer, Ferhan; Liu, Jie; Myerburg, Michael M; McDyer, John F; Liu, Yuan; Finkel, Toren; Chen, Bill B",Nat Commun,,130
398554,Covid-19 and Neuro-Behavioral Economics: A Conceptual Framework to Improve Physical and Mental Health among Remote Workers,2020,"INTRODUCTION: This study sought to analyse differences in epidemiology and survival between women and men living with HIV in the CoRIS cohort and the course of their disease over a 10-year period. METHODS: Variables of interest between women living with HIV and men living with HIV were compared. A trend analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel test. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a Cox regression analysis were used to study survival. RESULTS: A total of 10,469 people were enrolled; of them, 1,742 (16.6%) were women. At the time of enrolment in the cohort, women living with HIV, compared to men living with HIV, had higher rates of transmission due to intravenous drug use (IDU), hepatitisC virus (HCV) coinfection, AIDS-stage disease and foreign origin. They also had a worse immunovirological status and a lower educational level. These differences were maintained in the trend study. Regarding age, the women included in the cohort were older whereas the men were younger. In the comparative analysis between women according to place of origin, we found that the group of Spanish women living with HIV featured older women with higher rates of IDU transmission and HCV coinfection, whereas the group of women living with HIV born outside of Spain featured women with higher rates of syphilis infection. There were no major differences in relation to other characteristics such as educational level or disease status. Although sex was not a determinant of survival, conditions more prevalent in women were determinants of survival. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected women presented at diagnosis with certain epidemiological and HIV-associated characteristics that made them more vulnerable. These trends became more marked or did not improve during the years of observation.","Muñoz Hornero, Constanza; Muriel, Alfonso; Montero, Marta; Iribarren, José Antonio; Masía, Mar; Muñoz, Leopoldo; Sampériz, Gloria; Navarro, Gemma; Moreno, Santiago; Pérez-Elías, María Jesús",Enferm. infecc. microbiol. clin.

The purpose of pulmonary rehabilitation in COVID-19 patients is to improve symptoms of dyspnea, relieve anxiety, reduce complications, minimize disability, preserve function, and improve quality of life. Pulmonary rehabilitation during the acute management of COVID-19 should be considered when possible and safe and may include nutrition, airway, posture, clearance technique, oxygen supplementation, breathing exercises, stretching, manual therapy, and physical activity. Given the possibility of long-term disability, outpatient posthospitalization pulmonary rehabilitation may be considered in all patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Wang, Tina J; Chau, Brian; Lui, Mickey; Lam, Giang-Tuyet; Lin, Nancy; Humbert, Sarah",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,,130

Although the aerosol mediated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed, the physicochemical treatment of the biotic and abiotic objects is still the most promising approach in its infection control. The front line of the most effective disinfecting compounds on SARS-CoV-2 implies to be sodium hypochlorite, ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, quaternary ammonium compounds, and phenolic compounds, respectively. However, widely used compounds of alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride (benzalkonium chloride) biguanides (chlorhexidine) have not shown the multitude load reduction in less than 10 minutes. The susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to physical treatment follows the pattern of heat, acidity, and UV radiation. Rather all of the mentioned physical or chemical treatments, target the envelope proteins of the coronavirus mainly by impairing its entry to host cells. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of combinatorial physicochemical treatments or evaluation of new chemical entities or physical treatments such as microwave irradiation still needs to be explored. Therefore, the development of a reliable decontamination protocol for SARS-CoV-2 demands revealing its stability pattern study vs a spectrum of single and combinatorial physicochemical parameters.","Saadatpour, Fatemeh; Mohammadipanah, Fatemeh",Health Sci Rep,,130

The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the effects of the pandemic on surgical cases at a university hospital trauma center. METHODS: An observational study was performed at a trauma center in a tertiary hospital in Tokyo, Japan. The number of surgeries was compared between two periods: a historical control period (Tuesday April 9 to Monday May 27, 2019) and the period of the Japan State of Emergency due to COVID-19 (Tuesday April 7-Monday May 25, 2020). Information on patient age, gender, and surgical diagnosis, site, and procedure was collected for cases operated on in each period. The number of trauma surgeries was compared between the two periods. Data from the two periods were compared statistically. RESULTS: The total number of surgical cases was 151 in the control period and 83 in the COVID-19 period (including no cases with COVID-19), a decrease of 45.0%. There were significantly more surgeries for patients with hip fractures in the COVID-19 period (9 vs. 19, P < 0.001 by Fisher exact test).

Before resolving and overcoming the ""cytokine storm,"" with overexpression of pro-inflammatory interleukins (IL-, Il-6), this patient will be intubated for more than 48 h and therefore needs adequate nutrition. Malnutrition can lead to sarcopenia with a decrease in lean body mass and worsening of the inflammatory state underway. In addition, severe debilitation, if not corrected with adequate nutrition, can greatly lengthen rehabilitation times with prolonged hospitalization, increased costs, and reduced turn over already in crisis due to the health emergency caused by coronavirus. The aim of this study is to focus attention on the nutritional importance that must be provided in case of COVID-19 together with pharmacological treatments to lower the number of circulating proinflammatory cytokines. Oral, enteral, and parenteral nutrition should always be carried out according to the patient's condition and, in the case of a hyperinflammatory patient, such as the one affected by COVID-19, it has been shown that the supplementation of amino acids helps to lower the inflammatory state and promotes normal physiological recovery.","Ferrara, Francesco; De Rosa, Francesco; Vitiello, Antonio",SN Compr Clin Med,,130

To allow the public to be aware of the exposure risks in their daily activities, we proposed a birthday-paradox-based probability model and implement it into a web-based system named COSRE for estimating community exposure risks of public gathering during a pandemic. The exposure risk means the probability of people meeting potential COVID hosts in public places like grocery stores, gyms, libraries, restaurants, coffee shops, office suits, etc. The model has three inputs: the real-time potential active patients, the population in local communities, and the customer counts in the room. With COSRE, people can explore the possible impacts of the pandemic by doing spatiotemporal analysis, e.g., moving through time and testing a different number of people to see the changes of risks as the pandemic unfolds. The system has the potential to advance our ability to know the accurate exposure risks in various communities and allow us to make plans with improved preparedness and precise responses for the pandemic. We use spatial analysis tools and drew the county-level exposure risks of the United States from April 1 to May 15. The experiment shows that the estimation model is very promising to assist people to be more specifically precise about their safety control in daily routine and social lives and help businesses to dynamically adjust their COVID-19 policies to accelerate their recovery.","Sun, Ziheng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10497v1.pdf,130
403410,Black Adolescent Experiences with COVID-19 and Mental Health Services Utilization,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, many countries have instituted population-wide measures for social distancing. The requirement of patients on dialysis for regular treatment in settings typically not conducive to social distancing may increase their vulnerability to COVID-19. METHODS: Over a 6-week period, we recorded new COVID-19 infections and outcomes for all adult patients receiving dialysis in a large dialysis center. Rapidly introduced control measures included a two-stage routine screening process at dialysis entry (temperature and symptom check, with possible cases segregated within the unit and tested for SARS-CoV-2), isolated dialysis in a separate unit for patients with infection, and universal precautions that included masks for dialysis nursing staff. RESULTS: Of 1530 patients (median age 66 years; 58.2% men) receiving dialysis, 300 (19.6%) developed COVID-19 infection, creating a large demand for isolated outpatient dialysis and inpatient beds. An analysis that included 1219 patients attending satellite dialysis clinics found that older age was a risk factor for infection. COVID-19 infection was substantially more likely to occur among patients on in-center dialysis compared with those dialyzing at home. We observed clustering in specific units and on specific shifts, with possible implications for aspects of service design, and high rates of nursing staff illness. A predictive epidemic model estimated a reproduction number of 2.2; cumulative cases deviated favorably from the model from the fourth week, suggesting that the implemented measures controlled transmission. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 epidemic affected a large proportion of patients at this dialysis center, creating service pressures exacerbated by nursing staff illness. Details of the control strategy and characteristics of this epidemic may be useful for dialysis providers and other institutions providing patient care.","Corbett, Richard W; Blakey, Sarah; Nitsch, Dorothea; Loucaidou, Marina; McLean, Adam; Duncan, Neill; Ashby, Damien R",J Am Soc Nephrol,,130

One hundred and seventy professionally active health care workers took part in the study: doctors (n=41), nurses (n=114) and paramedics (n = 15). On average, study subjects were 37 years old and had 14 years of work experience. The following were used in this questionnaire-based study: General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Mini-COPE - Coping Inventory. The research group experienced high levels of stress. Nurses experienced the most acute stress. Increasing stress levels are accompanied by an intensification of psychopathological symptoms (insomnia and depression). Older individuals and those with more years worked at work experienced less psychopathological symptoms. Non-adaptive stress coping methods (e.g. use of psychoactive substances) resulted in deteriorating mental health within the research group. Habitual use of non-adaptive strategies may bring relief in the short term in the form of reduced negative consequences of stress transactions and facilitate mobilisation or just sufficient performance at work. However, in the longer term, it may lead to deteriorating health. The obtained data shows that positive reinterpretation, age and length of work track record constitute protective factors against deteriorating health.","Ziarko, Michal; Jasielska, Aleksandra; Stanislawska-Kubiak, Maia; Daroszewski, Przemyslaw; Samborski, Wlodzimierz; Mojs, Ewa",J. behav. health serv. res,,130

Steady knowledge on the pathogenesis of the virus has revealed certain consistent features specific to the disease which includes massive destruction of the lung due to the presence of excessive angiotensin-converting enzyme receptors (ACE2) which are essential for the viral entry inside the host. Once, access is gained multiplication occurs resulting in suppressing the immune response of the body against the virus.

We, therefore, aim to describe our experience with the use of early proning in awake, non-intubated patients with confirmed COVID-19. In our retrospective observational study, 23 patients with confirmed positive PCR test results for Severe Acute respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and hypoxemia that required oxygen therapy with or without non-invasive ventilation were treated with PP. Patients were classified into mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 disease. There were no targeted number of hours for proning per day and patients were kept in prone position according to their tolerance. The primary outcome measure was the avoidance of intubation and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stays and complications related to PP. The mean (standard deviation) age of our cohort was 54.5 (11.7) years, and the majority were males (21/23, 91.3%). Sixty-one per cent (14/23) of the patients were suffering from severe disease and 82.6% (19/23) had bilateral lung involvement with interstitial infiltrates. Majority of the patients were prone positioned for a median of 6 days (IQR 4 - 8). Only one patient required transfer to ICU for mechanical ventilation and subsequently died due to severe ARDS. All 22 patients showed progressive improvement in oxygen requirement and PF ratio, mostly after 3-5 days of proning. The mean length of hospital stay was 12 days. All patients, except one, were discharged in stable conditions, on room air or on a minimal oxygen requirement of 1-2 liters. No major complication of PP was recorded. Awake prone positioning is a valuable and safe therapeutic adjunct that can be applied in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. It can also be included in the home-based management protocols of COVID-19 to improve patient outcomes and mitigate the burden on health care facilities.","Khanum, Iffat; Samar, Fatima; Fatimah, Yousuf; Safia, Awan; Adil, Aziz; Kiren, Habib; Nasir, Nosheen; Faisal, Mahmood; Bushra, Jamil",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,130

RESULTS: the prevalence of self-perceived poor/medium knowledge was 57%. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, the odds ratio (OR) of self-perceived poor/medium COVID-19 knowledge level was increased for low/medium compared with high education level (OR 1.57; 95%CI 1.34-1.84), and decreased for SARS-CoV-2 testing (OR 0.25; 95%CI 0.16-0.39) and COVID-19 diagnosis (OR 0.20; 95%CI 0.07-0.60). There was no evidence of association between the other analysed variables and self-perceived knowledge level. CONCLUSIONS: the findings of this study suggest that low educational level is a determinant of low self-perceived knowledge on COVID-19 in middle-aged women.","Moccia, Chiara; Popovic, Maja; Isaevska, Elena; Moirano, Giovenale; Pizzi, Costanza; Rusconi, Franca; Merletti, Franco; Maule, Milena Maria; Richiardi, Lorenzo",Epidemiol Prev,,130

Applications in language generation for Arabic is still lagging in comparison to other NLP advances primarily due to the lack of advanced Arabic language generation models. In this paper, we develop the first advanced Arabic language generation model, AraGPT2, trained from scratch on large Arabic corpora of internet text and news articles. Our largest model, AraGPT2-mega, has 1.46 billion parameters, which makes it the largest Arabic language model available. We evaluate different size variants of AraGPT2 using the perplexity measure, where AraGPT2-mega achieves a perplexity of 29.8 on held-out articles from Wikipedia. Pretrained variants of AraGPT2 (base, medium, large, mega) are publicly available on https://github.com/aub-mind/arabert/aragpt2 hoping to encourage new research directions and applications for Arabic NLP.","Antoun, Wissam; Baly, Fady; Hajj, Hazem",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.15520v1.pdf,130

Robots that can conduct inter-floor navigation attract much public attention, since they can substitute human workers to conduct the service work. However, current robots either depend on human assistance or elevator retrofitting, and fully autonomous inter-floor navigation is still not available. As the very first step of inter-floor navigation, elevator button segmentation and recognition hold an important position. Therefore, we release the first large-scale publicly available elevator panel dataset in this work, containing 3,718 panel images with 35,100 button labels, to facilitate more powerful algorithms on autonomous elevator operation. Together with the dataset, a number of deep learning based implementations for button segmentation and recognition are also released to benchmark future methods in the community.

410214,Mental health and well-being of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: contrasting guidelines with experiences in practice,2020,"INTRODUCTION: International data indicate that arterial, venous and microvascular thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation occur in more than 30% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This condition is characterized by high levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. METHOD: Blood samples from three COVID-19 patients treated in a Hungarian intensive care unit were collected and analyzed with ClotPro® tests. EX-tests, IN-test, FIB-tests, RVV-tests, and TPA-tests were performed. The results were interpreted with respect to the clinical condition of the patients. RESULTS: Procoagulation, hypercoagulation and either fibrinolysis or a ""shut down"" phenomenon of the fibrinolytic process were found with ClotPro®. The ClotPro® parameters were consistent with the conventional coagulation tests and corresponded with the criteria of non-overt disseminated intravascular coagulation. CONCLUSION: These findings encourage further investigations to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients and may support the introduction of full dose anticoagulation with or without antiplatelet therapy. Interventional clinical trials may be helpful in defining the appropriate drug(s), for this purpose, the algorithms of administration, and the optimal duration of therapy. At present, the authorization of a clinical trial that attempts to answer these questions is in progress.

410745,COVID-19 and mental health in Brazil: Psychiatric symptoms in the general population,2020,"Since radio frequency (RF) signals from public mobile systems are stochastic and exhibit large temporal variations, the results of measurements, typically E field measurements, are time dependent and highly variable. Therefore, any 6-min measurements and 6-min averaged results to obtain the mean level strength at a given place may not be so reliable when it comes to determine long-term exposure levels. Specifically, the results of such short-term exposure assessments can be both under- or overestimated depending on whether the extreme value is caught during the measurement time. Because the RF range is active 24 h a day, the authors suggest that the monitoring process should cover the same time period. To evaluate the variability of measurement results, the analysis in this paper was conducted through descriptive statistics of the 24-h instantaneous, time-averaged and integral-based values. By applying the 24-h time-averaged and integral-based measure on a 24-h data set of measurements, the variability of daily exposure could be reduced to ±20% of the mean week value obtained either with the time-averaged or integral-based measure.","Suka, Darko; Pejovic, Predrag; Simic-Pejovic, Mirjana",Radiat Prot Dosimetry,,130

413262,Differential impact of COVID-related lockdown on mental health in Germany,2021,"There is increased evidence that the massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to the cytokine storm syndrome shapes the evolution of COVID-19 and is responsible of the severity of COVID-19 in some patients. A recent review argued that vitamin D deficiency could have increased the COVID-19 outbreak and suggested vitamin D supplementation as a preventive action. In fact, many factors seem to be correlated both to low vitamin D levels and the importance of COVID-19 spreading and severity. It is also important to highlight that the lockdown, implemented in many countries, prevents people to go out and then increases the risk of vitamin D deficiency. COPD patients are particularly at risk to have low levels of vitamin D due to multiple risk factors. COPD may generate a systemic inflammatory process responsible of secondary extra-pulmonary impairments. Vitamin D deficiency could sustain and aggravate the systemic inflammation associated to COPD. Reports have also shown that vitamin D deficiency was associated to exacerbations and hospital admissions, as well as lung function. Recent research showed that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced COPD exacerbations. Although vitamin D deficiency was not proved to be neither a risk factor of COVID-19, nor a determinant of its severity, vitamin D supplementation represents a preventive perspective that needs to be further studied.","Chaabouni, Malek; Feki, Walid; Chaabouni, Khansa; Kammoun, Samy",Adv Respir Med,,130

We build a hierarchical multilevel model of severe COVID-19 cases, using three different data sources: the National Family Health Survey for 2015/16, Census data for 2011 and data for COVID-19 deaths obtained cumulatively until June 2020. We provide results for 11 states of India, enabling best-yet targeting of policy actions.

414790,The COVID-19 pandemic and death anxiety in the elderly,2020,"Without any major changes, a pilot version of a physical science lab course was able to continue when the COVID-19 crisis necessitated the abrupt suspension of on-campus education. The 'Maker Lab' course, in which students conceive and set up their own experiments using affordable microcontrollers, required students to follow the entire arc of the empirical research cycle twice. The decision for and facilitation of such open-inquiry projects was based on and warranted by the literature on teaching the process of experimental research and the scientific method. The flipped classroom approach was used, where contact time is devoted to discussions and the students' actual experiments were carried out independently at home or elsewhere without the supervision of an instructor. Despite the COVID-19 measures, all students were able to produce interesting and successful research projects. While there were of course difficulties encountered in the abrupt transition to online teaching, we found several counterbalancing advantages that bear consideration for inclusion even when all teaching activities can return to campus. We believe that three components in the design of the course were vital to the resilience of the course: the choice for fully open-inquiry projects, the decision to use Arduinos as measurement tools, and the flipped aspect of the instruction methods. We also include considerations for adapting these pandemic-resilient methods in other courses and programs.","Bradbury, F. R.; Pols, C. F. J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06881v1.pdf,130

METHODS: We assessed the dynamics of COVID-19 disease spectrum, commencing from low-risk (no or low oxygen supplement), medium-risk (non-invasive ventilator or high oxygen supplement), and high-risk (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or invasive ventilator) risk state on enrollment, and then the subsequent progression and regression of risk states until discharge or death. The efficacy of antiviral therapy in altering the dynamics was assessed by using the high-risk state as a surrogate endpoint based on the data retrieved from the two-arm Adaptive Covid-19 Treatment Trial. RESULTS: Using the high-risk state as a surrogate endpoint, remdesivir treatment led to a decrease in the high-risk COVID-19 state by 34.8% (95% CI 26.7-42.0%) for a 14-day period and 29.3% (95% CI 28.8-29.8%) up to 28 days, which were consistent with a statistically significant reduction of death by 30.5% (95% CI 6.6, 50.9%) up to a 28-day period. The estimates of numbers needed to be treated were 100.9 (95% CI 88.1, 115.7) for using the high-risk COVID-19 state as a surrogate endpoint for a 14-day period and 133.3 (95% CI 112.5, 158.0) were required for averting one death from COVID-19 up to 28 days.

COVID‐19 has, and will continue to have, a profound impact on access to higher education. Students from underrepresented backgrounds are the most adversely affected by school closures, shifts to remote learning and shifting higher education policy environments. Whilst the full impact of the pandemic is yet to be fully realised, early international research is indicating that for students from underrepresented backgrounds there are risks to long‐term educational disengagement (Drane et al., 2020), barriers to accessing learning through technology (Montacute, 2020) and uncertainty over post‐school futures (The Smith Family, 2020). Whilst these challenges are not new, they are exacerbated and have the potential to widen inequalities within the education system and between students.

This study describes the administrative mechanism of joint participation and cooperation during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan and the rest of the country by health practitioners and administrative authorities. Methods: This study adopted a qualitative design. An analytical framework based on the theory of policy participation that included stimulus, setting, and position of policy participation was constructed. Qualitative data of policy participation by health practitioners and administrative authorities consisted of publicly available data. Results: Early during the outbreak, from December 2019 to January 2020, three main stages occurred according to the containment situation. The first stage was characterized by limited knowledge of the transmission dynamics of the virus and a consequently weak response. In the second stage, the disease spreads rapidly because of travel during a national festival. In the third stage, particularly when top Chinese leaders delivered instructions to intensify containment efforts, diverse departments initiated joint prevention and control measures to combat COVID-19. Conclusion: The administrative mechanism of joint participation and cooperation was instrumental in avoiding a substantial increase in both cases and fatalities in the initial stage of the outbreak. This joint participation provides valuable experience and initiatives for major public health emergency preparedness, and the new empirical evidence further highlights the importance of policy participation theory in epidemic prevention in other countries.","Yan, Jingjing; Zhao, Dahai",Risk Manage.

423278,Editorial- Racial discrimination in health care: An “us” problem,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although AKI lacks effective therapeutic approaches, preventive strategies using preconditioning protocols, including caloric restriction and hypoxic preconditioning, have been shown to prevent injury in animal models. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the enhanced resistance to AKI conferred by such approaches is needed to facilitate clinical use. We hypothesized that these preconditioning strategies use similar pathways to augment cellular stress resistance. METHODS: To identify genes and pathways shared by caloric restriction and hypoxic preconditioning, we used RNA-sequencing transcriptome profiling to compare the transcriptional response with both modes of preconditioning in mice before and after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. RESULTS: The gene expression signatures induced by both preconditioning strategies involve distinct common genes and pathways that overlap significantly with the transcriptional changes observed after ischemia-reperfusion injury. These changes primarily affect oxidation-reduction processes and have a major effect on mitochondrial processes. We found that 16 of the genes differentially regulated by both modes of preconditioning were strongly correlated with clinical outcome; most of these genes had not previously been directly linked to AKI. CONCLUSIONS: This comparative analysis of the gene expression signatures in preconditioning strategies shows overlapping patterns in caloric restriction and hypoxic preconditioning, pointing toward common molecular mechanisms. Our analysis identified a limited set of target genes not previously known to be associated with AKI; further study of their potential to provide the basis for novel preventive strategies is warranted. To allow for optimal interactive usability of the data by the kidney research community, we provide an online interface for user-defined interrogation of the gene expression datasets (http://shiny.cecad.uni-koeln.de:3838/IRaP/).","Johnsen, Marc; Kubacki, Torsten; Yeroslaviz, Assa; Späth, Martin Richard; Mörsdorf, Jannis; Göbel, Heike; Bohl, Katrin; Ignarski, Michael; Meharg, Caroline; Habermann, Bianca; Altmüller, Janine; Beyer, Andreas; Benzing, Thomas; Schermer, Bernhard; Burst, Volker; Müller, Roman-Ulrich",J Am Soc Nephrol,,130

425935,How nurses can support children and young people's mental health during COVID-19: The pandemic has created a toxic environment in some families – and the effect is now coming to light,2021,"Introduction: The Promoting Activity, Independence and Stability in Early Dementia (PrAISED) is delivering an exercise programme for people with dementia. The Lincolnshire partnership National Health Service (NHS) foundation Trust successfully delivered PrAISED through a video-calling platform during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: This qualitative case-study aimed to identify participants that video delivery worked for, to highlight its benefits and its challenges. Interviews were conducted between May and August 2020 with five participants with dementia and their caregivers (n = 10), as well as five therapists from the Lincolnshire partnership NHS foundation Trust. The interviews were analysed through thematic analysis. RESULTS: Video delivery worked best when participants had a supporting caregiver and when therapists showed enthusiasm and had an established rapport with the client. Benefits included time efficiency of sessions, enhancing participants' motivation, caregivers' dementia awareness, and therapists' creativity. Limitations included users' poor IT skills and resources. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic required innovative ways of delivering rehabilitation. This study supports that people with dementia can use tele-rehabilitation, but success is reliant on having a caregiver and an enthusiastic and known therapist.","Di Lorito, Claudio; Duff, Carol; Rogers, Carol; Tuxworth, Jane; Bell, Jocelyn; Fothergill, Rachael; Wilkinson, Lindsey; Bosco, Alessandro; Howe, Louise; O039,; Brien, Rebecca; Godfrey, Maureen; Dunlop, Marianne; van der Wardt, Veronika; Booth, Vicky; Logan, Pip; Cowley, Alison; Harwood, Rowan H",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,130

During this time, a number of manual fact-checking initiatives have emerged to alleviate the spread of dis/mis-information. This study is about COVID-19 debunks published in multiple languages by different fact-checking organisations, sometimes as far as several months apart, despite the fact that the claim has already been fact-checked before. The spatiotemporal analysis reveals that similar or nearly duplicate false COVID-19 narratives have been spreading in multifarious modalities on various social media platforms in different countries. We also find that misinformation involving general medical advice has spread across multiple countries and hence has the highest proportion of false COVID-19 narratives that keep being debunked. Furthermore, as manual fact-checking is an onerous task in itself, therefore debunking similar claims recurrently is leading to a waste of resources. To this end, we propound the idea of the inclusion of multilingual debunk search in the fact-checking pipeline.","Singh, Iknoor; Bontcheva, Kalina; Scarton, Carolina",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12303v2.pdf,130
427978,Ethics and equity in the time of coronavirus,2020,"Purpose: Refugee camps can be severely struck by pandemics, like potential COVID-19 outbreaks, due to high population densities and often only base-level medical infrastructure Fast responding medical systems can help to avoid spikes in infections and death rates as they allow the prompt isolation and treatment of patients At the same time, the normal demand for emergency medical services has to be dealt with as well The overall goal of this study is the design of an emergency service system that is appropriate for both types of demand Design/methodology/approach: A spatial hypercube queuing model (HQM) is developed that uses queuing-theory methods to determine locations for emergency medical vehicles (also called servers) Therefore, a general optimization approach is applied, and subsequently, virus outbreaks at various locations of the study areas are simulated to analyze and evaluate the solution proposed The derived performance metrics offer insights into the behavior of the proposed emergency service system during pandemic outbreaks The Za'atari refugee camp in Jordan is used as a case study Findings: The derived locations of the emergency medical system (EMS) can handle all non-virus-related emergency demands If additional demand due to virus outbreaks is considered, the system becomes largely congested The HQM shows that the actual congestion is highly dependent on the overall amount of outbreaks and the corresponding case numbers per outbreak Multiple outbreaks are much harder to handle even if their cumulative average case number is lower than for one singular outbreak Additional servers can mitigate the described effects and lead to enhanced resilience in the case of virus outbreaks and better values in all considered performance metrics Research limitations/implications: Some parameters that were assumed for simplification purposes as well as the overall model should be verified in future studies with the relevant designers of EMSs in refugee camps Moreover, from a practitioners perspective, the application of the model requires, at least some, training and knowledge in the overall field of optimization and queuing theory Practical implications: The model can be applied to different data sets, e g refugee camps or temporary shelters The optimization model, as well as the subsequent simulation, can be used collectively or independently It can support decision-makers in the general location decision as well as for the simulation of stress-tests, like virus outbreaks in the camp area Originality/value: The study addresses the research gap in an optimization-based design of emergency service systems for refugee camps The queuing theory-based approach allows the calculation of precise (expected) performance metrics for both the optimization process and the subsequent analysis of the system Applied to pandemic outbreaks, it allows for the simulation of the behavior of the system during stress-tests and adds a further tool for designing resilient emergency service systems © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","Blank, F.",Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management,,130

Longitudinal observational study including veterans receiving mental health treatment at a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facility from January 1, 2017 to June 16, 2020. Observed and expected patient care for on-going and new treatment of depression, posttraumatic stress, substance use disorder, severe mental illness diagnoses, overdose, and suicide attempts, and psychotropic prescriptions for antidepressant, antipsychotic, benzodiazepine, opioid, and mood stabilizing medications are depicted. Percent change between actual and expected counts in the early months of the COVID pandemic (March 18-May 5, 2020) are computed. Decreases in counts of patients receiving mental health treatment early in the pandemic ranged from 7% to 20% for on-going treatment, and 28% to 37% for new treatment. TMH rapidly expanded across VHA, becoming the primary means by which encounters were delivered. Counts of patients receiving on-going care for suicide attempts were stable, and for overdoses, decreased by 17%. Counts of patients initiating care for suicide attempts and overdoses decreased by 30% and 38%, respectively. Weekly prescriptions and medication on-hand for psychotropics ranged from a 2% decrease to a 4% increase. New patient prescribing decreased 21%-50%. VHA and other large healthcare systems will need to expand outreach and continue to develop TMH services to maintain care continuity and initiate care for existing and new patients during COVID-19 and future large-scale outbreaks, epidemics, and disasters.

However, despite a lower risk of children becoming acutely ill with COVID-19, there nevertheless may be significant and potentially sustained effects of COVID-19 on the physical, psychological, and emotional health and well-being of children. Focusing on the context of children's cancer care, and specifically bone marrow transplant (BMT), we describe some of these effects and then address one specific ethical challenge that arises. That is the question of what and how much to tell children whose cancer treatment has been changed because of COVID-19. Drawing on our previous work on the ethical reasons for telling the truth to younger children (aged 5-12) we link different ethical reasons to the different types of information that could be given to children in this context. We argue that children should be given an explanation of the changes that they will directly experience, including some changes to the process of their actual medical treatment; but not about increased risk associated with these changes, unless they specifically ask for this information.","Gillam, Lynn; Spriggs, Merle; Delany, Clare; Conyers, Rachael; McCarthy, Maria",J Bioeth Inq,,130

RESULTS: early evidence show high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents, due to the pandemic itself, to social isolation and to parents' stress. High grade students, females and low-income families are at higher risk to develop psychiatric symptoms. Psychological distress can be reduced by maintaining contact with peers through social networks and by accurate updates provided by the government through the mass media. Online resources such as information about mental health education and preventive measure, video-counselling, telemedicine and telepsychiatry services, can be useful to reduce the psychosocial effects of the novel coronavirus.

This is necessary both at the individual level, to inform diagnosis, treatment and contract tracing, as well as at the population level to inform policies to control spread of the infection. The gold-standard RT-qPCR test for the virus is relatively expensive and takes time, so combining multiple samples into ""pools"" that are tested together has emerged as a useful way to test many individuals with less than one test per person. Here, we describe the basic idea behind pooling of samples and different methods for reconstructing the result for each individual from the test of pooled samples. The methods range from simple pooling, where each pool is disjoint from the other, to more complex combinatorial pooling where each sample is split into multiple pools and each pool has a specified combination of samples. We describe efforts to validate these testing methods clinically and the potential advantages of the combinatorial pooling method named Tapestry Pooling that relies on compressed sensing techniques.","Gopalkrishnan, Manoj; Krishna, Sandeep",J Indian Inst Sci,,130
440352,Mindfulness practice for protecting mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 provided the impetus for unprecedented adoption of telemedicine. This study aimed to understand video visit adoption by plastic surgery providers; and patient and surgeon perceptions about its efficacy, value, accessibility, and long-term viability. A secondary aim was to develop the proposed 'Triage Tool for Video Visits in Plastic Surgery' to help determine visit video eligibility. METHODS: This mixed-methods evaluation assessed provider-level scheduling data from the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Stanford Health Care to quantify telemedicine adoption and semi-structured phone interviews with patients (n = 20) and surgeons (n = 10) to explore stakeholder perspectives on video visits. RESULTS: During the 13-week period after the local stay-at-home orders due to coronavirus disease 2019, 21.4% of preoperative visits and 45.5% of postoperative visits were performed via video. Video visits were considered acceptable by patients and surgeons in plastic surgery in terms of quality of care but were limited by the inability to perform a physical examination. Interviewed clinicians reported that long-term viability needs to be centered around technology (eg, connection, video quality, etc) and physical examinations. Our findings informed a proposed triage tool to determine the appropriateness of video visits for individual patients that incorporates visit type, anesthesia, case, surgeon's role, and patient characteristics. CONCLUSION: Video technology has the potential to facilitate and improve preoperative and postoperative patient care in plastic surgery but the following components are needed: patient education on taking high-quality photos; standardized clinical guidelines for conducting video visits; and an algorithm-assisted triage tool to support scheduling.","Brown-Johnson, Cati G; Spargo, Tavish; Kling, Samantha M R; Saliba-Gustafsson, Erika A; Lestoquoy, Anna Sophia; Garvert, Donn W; Vilendrer, Stacie; Winget, Marcy; Asch, Steven M; Maggio, Paul; Nazerali, Rahim S",Surgery,,130

The inability to conduct traditional evaluations has left neuropsychologists with the unprecedented task of determining how to modify existing paradigms while balancing the need to provide services and adhere to safety parameters. The COVID-19 literature suggests clinicians are modifying their evaluations based on the following models: (1) continuing to administer in-person evaluations; (2) discontinuing all evaluations due to issues related to standardization, test security, and patient-specific characteristics; (3) conducting virtual evaluations; and/or (4) adopting a hybrid model incorporating both traditional and technology-based modalities. Given the challenges with models 1-3, along with the modifications in telehealth guidelines and insurance reimbursement rates, neuropsychologists are more poised than ever to solidify the implementation of a hybrid model that lasts beyond COVID-19. We introduce the term Hybrid Neuropsychology, a model for the future of neuropsychological evaluations that includes three Action Items: (1) building a technology-based practice; (2) integrating data science; and (3) engaging with innovators in other fields. Hybrid Neuropsychology will enable clinicians to effectively modernize their practice, improve health care equity, and ensure neuropsychology secures its place in a technology-based world.","Singh, Shifali; Germine, Laura",Int Rev Psychiatry,,130

Two days before VAP onset we observed a transcriptional signature of bacterial infection. Two weeks prior to VAP onset, following intubation, we observed a striking impairment in immune signaling in COVID-19 patients who developed VAP. Longitudinal metatranscriptomic analysis revealed disruption of lung microbiome community composition in patients with VAP, providing a connection between dysregulated immune signaling and outgrowth of opportunistic pathogens. These findings suggest that COVID-19 patients who develop VAP have impaired antibacterial immune defense detectable weeks before secondary infection onset.","Tsitsiklis, A.; Zha, B.; Byrne, A.; DeVoe, C.; Levan, S.; Rackaityte, E.; Sunshine, S.; Mick, E.; Ghale, R.; Jauregui, A.; Neff, N.; Sarma, A.; Serpa, P.; Deiss, T.; Kistler, A.; Carrillo, S.; Ansel, K.

Whether this evolution will lead to changes in the transmission, the duration, or the severity of the disease is not clear. This has led to considerable scientific and media debate, from raising alarms about evolutionary change to dismissing it. Here we review what little is currently known about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and extend existing evolutionary theory to consider how selection might be acting upon the virus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there is currently no definitive evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing further adaptation, continued evidence-based analysis of evolutionary change is important so that public health measures can be adjusted in response to substantive changes in the infectivity or severity of COVID-19.","Day, Troy; Gandon, Sylvain; Lion, Sébastien; Otto, Sarah P",Curr Biol,,130

In Peru, following confirmation of the first case in early March, the measures adopted by the government aimed to mitigate mass transmission and the impact on vulnerable populations through the imposition of an early quarantine, border closings, restriction of domestic and international travel, social distancing, a relief allowance for poor and extremely poor Peruvians, early withdrawal of deposits from private pensions, and closing of schools and universities in order to avoid the collapse of health systems, already weakened. Factors in the country's insufficient response to COVID-19 include lack of infrastructure and deficient logistics in the health systems at the national level, centralization of the response plan in hospitals in the capital Lima, low initial budgeting to deal with disease, which includes insufficient medical supplies, limited commitment by the population to comply with the containment measures imposed by the government, and precarious job security and high labor informality. The results are the consequences of decades of low investment in health, education, and labor. TB patients are at high risk of succumbing to the novel coronavirus due to their vulnerability from chronic lung damage, associated comorbidities, including HIV infection and diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, and poverty. A preliminary observational study in China had already identified pulmonary TB as a risk factor for severe COVID-19, corroborating previous findings with other viral pneumonias: influenza, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1. In addition, case series of coinfection have already been reported that involve a diagnosis of TB following infection with the novel coronavirus. Meanwhile, COVID-19 survivors may run a high risk of acquiring TB, and infection with the novel coronavirus itself can increase the risk of progression of latent TB infection to the active disease. The hypothetical mechanism lies in immunodepression. A challenge for Peru's national public health system is to mitigate the pandemic's effects without failing to care for preexisting diseases. It is thus essential to anticipate the potentially destructive synergy between COVID-19, TB, and poverty.","Aguilar-Leon, P.; Cotrina-Castaneda, J.; Zavala-Flores, E.",Cadernos de Saude Publica,,130
445251,Discrimination and mental health outcomes in British Black and South Asian people during the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 is an acute inflammatory respiratory disease. It causes many changes in hemogram parameters. Low albumin levels are associated with mortality risk in hospitalized patients. The aim of the present study is to reveal the place of neutrophil count to albumin ratio in predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: 144 patients, 65 females and 79 males, were included in the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 was the non-severe group (n:85), and Group 2 was severe (n:59). Demographic data, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts, albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were recorded. Neutrophil count to albumin ratio (NAR) was calculated by dividing the absolute neutrophil counts by the albumin levels. The NAR and levels of the two groups were then compared. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in gender and platelet count (201 vs. 211 K/mL) between the groups (p>0,05). Ages (62.0 ± 14.3 vs 68.6 ± 12.2 years), albumin (33.1 vs 29.9 gr/L), CRP (33 vs 113 mg/l), neutrophil count (4 vs 7.24 K/mL), WBC counts (6.70 vs 8.50 K/mL), NAR values (113.5 vs 267.2) and number of Death (5 vs 33) were found to be statistically higher (p <0.001) in Group 2 than in Group 1. The NAR value of 201.5 showed mortality in all patients with COVID-19 to have 71.1% sensitivity and 71.7% specificity (AUC:0.736, 95% CI: 0.641-0.832, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The present study showed that NAR levels can be a cheap and simple marker for predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Varim, Ceyhun; Yaylaci, Selcuk; Demirci, Taner; Kaya, Tezcan; Nalbant, Ahmet; Dheir, Hamad; Senocak, Didar; Kurt, Rumeysa; Cengiz, Hasret; Karacaer, Cengiz",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),,130
446036,Mental Health Outcomes of the COVID-19 Pandemic and a Collapsing Economy: Perspectives from a Developing Country,2020,"OBJECTIVES: We report our experience with an emergency room (ER) shutdown related to an accidental exposure to a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who had not been isolated. SETTING: A 635-bed, tertiary-care hospital in Daegu, South Korea. METHODS: To prevent nosocomial transmission of the disease, we subsequently isolated patients with suspected symptoms, relevant radiographic findings, or epidemiology. Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays (RT-PCR) were performed for most patients requiring hospitalization. A universal mask policy and comprehensive use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were implemented. We analyzed effects of these interventions. RESULTS: From the pre-shutdown period (February 10-25, 2020) to the post-shutdown period (February 28 to March 16, 2020), the mean hourly turnaround time decreased from 23:31 ±6:43 hours to 9:27 ±3:41 hours (P < .001). As a result, the proportion of the patients tested increased from 5.8% (N=1,037) to 64.6% (N=690) (P < .001) and the average number of tests per day increased from 3.8±4.3 to 24.7±5.0 (P < .001). All 23 patients with COVID-19 in the post-shutdown period were isolated in the ER without any problematic accidental exposure or nosocomial transmission. After the shutdown, several metrics increased. The median duration of stay in the ER among hospitalized patients increased from 4:30 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 2:17-9:48) to 14:33 hours (IQR, 6:55-24:50) (P < .001). Rates of intensive care unit admissions increased from 1.4% to 2.9% (P = .023), and mortality increased from 0.9% to 3.0% (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Problematic accidental exposure and nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 can be successfully prevented through active isolation and surveillance policies and comprehensive PPE use despite longer ER stays and the presence of more severely ill patients during a severe COVID-19 outbreak.","Kim, Yun Jeong; Choe, Jae Young; Kwon, Ki Tae; Hwang, Soyoon; Choi, Gyu-Seog; Sohn, Jin Ho; Kim, Jong Kun; Yeo, In Hwan; Cho, Yeon Joo; Ham, Ji Yeon; Song, Kyung Eun; Lee, Nan Young",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,130

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the prevalence of common misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online survey via social media platforms and a survey company to determine whether respondents have been exposed to a broad set of false claims and fact-checked information on the disease. RESULTS: We obtained more than 41,000 responses from 1257 participants in 85 countries, but for our analysis, we only included responses from 35 countries that had at least 15 respondents. We identified a strong negative correlation between a country's Gross Domestic Product per-capita and the prevalence of misinformation, with poorer countries having a higher prevalence of misinformation (Spearman &#961;=-0.72; P<.001). We also found that fact checks spread to a lesser degree than their respective false claims, following a sublinear trend (ß=.64). CONCLUSIONS: Our results imply that the potential harm of misinformation could be more substantial for low-income countries than high-income countries. Countries with poor infrastructures might have to combat not only the spreading pandemic but also the COVID-19 infodemic, which can derail efforts in saving lives.","Cha, Meeyoung; Cha, Chiyoung; Singh, Karandeep; Lima, Gabriel; Ahn, Yong-Yeol; Kulshrestha, Juhi; Varol, Onur",JMIR Hum Factors,,130

449111,The effects of COVID-19 restrictions on physical activity and mental health of children and young adults with physical and/or intellectual disabilities,2021,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has resulted in a tremendous increase in hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions all over the world. Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) warranting ICU treatment usually have prolonged mechanical ventilation and are expected to be prone to develop psychological impairments, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression, which negatively impact quality of life. To date, no effective treatment strategy is available. In the current trial, we aim to assess the effect of an ICU-specific virtual reality (ICU-VR) intervention on psychological well-being and quality of life after COVID-19 ICU treatment. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomized controlled trial, we aim to examine whether COVID-19-specific ICU-VR, offered 3 months after hospital discharge, improves psychological well-being and quality of life. Secondary objectives are, firstly, to examine the intra-group changes in psychological well-being and quality of life and the inter-group differences in psychological well-being and quality of life during follow-up, up to 12 months after hospital discharge, and secondly, to examine patients' satisfaction with and rating of ICU care and aftercare and patients' perspectives on ICU-VR. Eighty adult patients treated for COVID-19 in the mixed-surgical ICUs of four hospitals in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, will be included and randomized (1:1) to either early or late ICU-VR between June 29 and December 31, 2020. Patients randomized to early ICU-VR will receive the ICU-VR intervention during an outpatient clinic visit 3 months after hospital discharge, whereas patients randomized to late ICU-VR will receive ICU-VR 6 months after hospital discharge. Primary outcomes of this study are psychological well-being, assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and quality of life, assessed using the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and RAND-36 questionnaires, up to 6 months after hospital discharge. DISCUSSION: Currently, an effective treatment for psychological sequelae after ICU treatment for specific illnesses is unavailable. Results from this study will provide insight whether virtual reality is a modality that can be used in ICU aftercare to improve psychological well-being and quality of life, or satisfaction, after ICU treatment for specific illnesses such as COVID-19.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the virus has spread rapidly throughout the world, taking thousands of lives in just over 2 months. It is critical to refine the incidence and mortality risks of COVID-19 for the effective management of the general public and patients during the outbreak. In this report, we investigate the incidence and mortality risks of the infection by analyzing the age composition of 5,319 infected patients, 76 fatal cases, and 1,144,648 individuals of the general public in China. Our results show a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for seniors. Notably, mortality risk could be as high as 0.48 for people older than 80 years. Furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less.","Li, Hongdou; Wang, Shuang; Zhong, Fan; Bao, Wuyin; Li, Yipeng; Liu, Lei; Wang, Hongyan; He, Yungang",Front.

450155,Mental Health and Economic Concerns from March to May during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Canada: Insights from an Analysis of Repeated Cross-sectional Surveys,2020,"The onset of locomotion heralds one of the major life transitions in early development and involves a pervasive set of changes in perception, spatial cognition, and social and emotional development. Through a synthesis of published and hitherto unpublished findings, gathered from a number of converging research designs and methods, this article provides a comprehensive review and reanalysis of the consequences of self-produced locomotor experience. Specifically, we focus on the role of locomotor experience in changes in social and emotional development, referential gestural communication, wariness of heights, the perception of self-motion, distance perception, spatial search, and spatial coding strategies. Our analysis reveals new insights into the specific processes by which locomotor experience brings about psychological changes. We elaborate these processes and provide new predictions about previously unsuspected links between locomotor experience and psychological function. The research we describe is relevant to our broad understanding of the developmental process, particularly as it pertains to developmental transitions. Although acknowledging the role of genetically mediated developmental changes, our viewpoint is a transactional one in which a single acquisition, in this case the onset of locomotion, sets in motion a family of experiences and processes that in turn mobilize both broad-based and context-specific psychological reorganizations. We conclude that, in infancy, the onset of locomotor experience brings about widespread consequences, and after infancy, can be responsible for an enduring role in development by maintaining and updating existing skills.","Campos, Joseph J; Anderson, David I; Barbu-Roth, Marianne A; Hubbard, Edward M; Hertenstein, Matthew J; Witherington, David",Infancy,,130

Considering the increase in emerging infectious diseases and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is timely to review and synthesize the available evidence on the psychological impact of disease outbreaks on HCWs. Thus, we conducted a systematic review to examine the impact of epidemics and pandemics on the mental health of HCWs. METHOD: PubMed, PsycInfo, and PsycArticles databases were systematically searched from inception to June-end 2020 for studies reporting the impact of a pandemic/epidemic on the mental health of HCWs. RESULTS: Seventy-six studies were included in this review. Of these, 34 (45%) focused on SARS, 28 (37%) on COVID-19, seven (9%) on MERS, four (5%) on Ebola, two (3%) on H1N1, and one (1%) on H7N9. Most studies were cross-sectional (93%) and were conducted in a hospital setting (95%). Common mental health symptoms identified by this review were acute stress disorder, depression, anxiety, insomnia, burnout, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The associated risk factors were working in high-risk environments (frontline), being female, being a nurse, lack of adequate personal protective equipment, longer shifts, lack of knowledge of the virus, inadequate training, less years of experience in healthcare, lack of social support, and a history of quarantine. CONCLUSION: HCWs working in the frontline during epidemics and pandemics experience a wide range of mental health symptoms. It is imperative that adequate psychological support be provided to HCWs during and after these extraordinary distressful events.","Chigwedere, Ottilia Cassandra; Sadath, Anvar; Kabir, Zubair; Arensman, Ella",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,130
452657,"Prevalence, management, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections in older people and those with dementia in mental health wards in London, UK: a retrospective observational study",2020,"Introduction: Atypical bacterial coinfections, including more rare organisms such as Legionella pneumophila, can complicate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections. Care should be taken to avoid anchoring bias and ensure all bacterial coinfections are diagnosed and treated in patients with COVID-19. CASE REPORT: A 49-year-old male with no past medical history developed abdominal pain, diarrhea and cough on April 4, 2020. He tested positive for SARS-CoV 2 on April 6th given there were several people at his work that had recently contracted coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Over the next week he developed progressive fever, cough, anosmia, ageusia and then dyspnea with exertion which prompted him to seek medical care. Shortly after admission, he became more febrile, tachycardic and hypoxic requiring oxygen supplementation via high-flow nasal cannula. His oxygen requirements continued to worsen, and he was transferred to the ICU and intubated. His procalcitonin was elevated at 8.99 and he was started on empiric broad spectrum antibiotics. Tracheal aspirate was tested via PCR and returned positive for Legionella pneumophila. He also tested positive for Legionella urinary antigen. He received hydroxychloroquine for 7 days, IV doxycycline for 10 days, ceftriaxone for 6 days and piperacillin-tazobactam for 2 days. He gradually improved and was successfully weaned off supplemental oxygen. He was discharged after a 10-day hospital stay with minimal respiratory symptoms. DISCUSSION: Among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, Legionella bacterial coinfection appears to be rare. In a systematic review published in July 2020, Rawson et al reported that only 8% (62/806) of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were diagnosed with a bacterial pneumonia coinfection and found only one patient who had COVID-19 and Legionella. However, it has been reported that there may be an increased risk of Legionella infections during the COVID-19 pandemic due to water systems being used less often because of lockdown orders. In September 2020, De Giglio et al reported that a large Italian hospital found a significant increase in Legionella pneumophila isolates on routine water system testing in two of three wards which had been closed for over a month due to emergency reorganization. It remains important to keep Legionella bacterial co-infection on the differential when treating COVID-19 since it may require a longer treatment regimen than what is recommended for treating standard community acquired pneumonia. In addition, the pandemic response has the potential to increase the risk of legionella infections secondary to stagnant water systems in lockdowns.","Anderson, B.; Nathani, A.; Ghamande, S.

454118,Editorial Perspective: Rethinking child and adolescent mental health care after COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic poses major risks to health care workers in neurocritical care. Recommendations are in place to limit medical personnel attending to the neurosurgical patient as a protective measure and to conserve personal protective equipment. However, the complexity of the neurosurgical patient proves to be a challenge and an opportunity for innovation. The goal of our study was to determine if telemedicine delivered through smart glasses was feasible and effective in an alternative method of conducting ward round on neurocritical care patients during the pandemic. METHODS: A random pair of neurosurgery resident and specialist conducted consecutive virtual and physical ward rounds on neurocritical patients. A virtual ward round was first conducted remotely by a specialist who received real-time audiovisual information from a resident wearing smart glasses integrated with telemedicine. Subsequently, a physical ward round was performed together by the resident and specialist on the same patient. The management plans of both ward rounds were compared, and the intrarater reliability was measured. On study completion a qualitative survey was performed. RESULTS: Ten paired ward rounds were performed on 103 neurocritical care patients with excellent overall intrarater reliability. Nine out of 10 showed good to excellent internal consistency, and 1 showed acceptable internal consistency. Qualitative analysis indicated wide user acceptance and high satisfaction rate with the alternative method. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual ward rounds using telemedicine via smart glasses on neurosurgical patients in critical care were feasible, effective, and widely accepted as an alternative to physical ward rounds during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Munusamy, Thangaraj; Karuppiah, Ravindran; Bahuri, Nor Faizal A; Sockalingam, Sutharshan; Cham, Chun Yoong; Waran, Vicknes",World neurosurgery (Online),,130

454440,Covid-19 Related Psychiatric Disorders and the New Psychosocial Rehabilitation,2020,"Today, due to the prevalence of various diseases such as the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), diabetes, central nervous system diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and so on, extensive studies have been conducted on therapeutic properties of natural and synthetic agents. A literature review on herbal medicine and commercial products in the global market showed that curcumin (Cur) has many therapeutic benefits compared to other natural ingredients. Despite the unique properties of Cur, its use in clinical trials is very limited. The poor biopharmaceutical properties of Cur such as short half-life in plasma, low bioavailability, poor absorption, rapid metabolism, very low solubility (at acidic and physiological pH), and the chemical instability in body fluids are major concerns associated with the clinical applications of Cur. Recently, nanoformulations are emerging as approaches to develop and improve the therapeutic efficacy of various drugs. Many studies have shown that Cur nanoformulations have tremendous therapeutic potential against various diseases such as SARS-CoV-2, cancer, inflammatory, osteoporosis, and so on. These nanoformulations can inhibit many diseases through several cellular and molecular mechanisms. However, successful long-term clinical results are required to confirm their safety and clinical efficacy.

455086,A Psychiatric-COVID Unit: The National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) Experience,2021,"Background: Although the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting a relatively small proportion of the global population, its effects have already reached everyone. The pandemic has the potential to differentially disadvantage chronically ill patients, including those with Parkinson's disease (PD). The first health care reaction has been to limit access to clinics and neurology wards to preserve fragile patients with PD from being infected. In some regions, the shortage of medical staff has also forced movement disorders neurologists to provide care for patients with COVID-19. Objective: To share the experience of various movement disorder neurologists operating in different world regions and provide a common approach to patients with PD, with a focus on those already on advanced therapies, which may serve as guidance in the current pandemic and for emergency situations that we may face in the future. Conclusion: Most of us were unprepared to deal with this condition given that in many health care systems, telemedicine has been only marginally available or only limited to email or telephone contacts. In addition, to ensure sufficient access to intensive care unit beds, most elective procedures (including deep brain stimulation or the initiation of infusion therapies) have been postponed. We all hope there will soon be a time when we will return to more regular hospital schedules. However, we should consider this crisis as an opportunity to change our approach and encourage our hospitals and health care systems to facilitate the remote management of chronic neurological patients, including those with advanced PD.","Fasano, Alfonso; Antonini, Angelo; Katzenschlager, Regina; Krack, Paul; Odin, Per; Evans, Andrew H.; Foltynie, Thomas; Volkmann, Jens; Merello, Marcelo",Mov.

An increasing number of clinical trials have been registered to evaluate the effects of TCM for COVID-19. The aim of this study was to review the existing TCM clinical trial registrations and identify potentially promising and available TCM therapies, in order to provide a reference for the global management of COVID-19. Methods: All clinical trials on TCM for COVID-19 registered in registry platforms worldwide were searched. The data of registration temporal trend, design, objective, interventions, and relevant information were reviewed and summarized. Results: 161 TCM trials were identified from three registries (January 26 to May 14 2020). Of these, 94 (58.4%) were randomized controlled trials and 114 trials (70.8%) assessed therapeutic effects; while the remainder focused on prevention, rehabilitation, and the epidemiology of TCM syndromes. Eight trials (5.0%) had completed their recruitment. TCM interventions with potential for further evaluation in terms of prevention were moxibustion, Huoxiang Zhengqi pill and Jinye Baidu granules.

455750,Telepsychiatry and other cutting-edge technologies in COVID-19 pandemic: Bridging the distance in mental health assistance,2020,"Aim: To estimate the epidemiological parameters related to the Covid-19 outbreak in Iran. Background: Estimating the epidemiological parameters of new public health threat (COVID-19) is essential to support and inform public health decision-making in different communities including Iran. Methods: We established a mathematical model to estimate the epidemiological parameters from 19 Feb to 15 March based on daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Iran. Then, we estimated the effect of early traffic restriction on our estimation. Results: We estimated the R0 at 2.11 (95% CI, 1.87-2.50) and the infected number at 92,260 (95% CI: 59,263 -152,212) by 15 March. Our estimate for the ascertainment rate was about 1.2% (95% CI: 1.1-1.4). The latent period estimation was 4.24 (95% CI: 2.84-6.65). We observed a decline in our estimate after considering the traffic restriction. Conclusion: Our results suggest that health authorities in Iran must take impactful strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak to reach R0&lt;1. Therefore, the establishment of complementary, multilateral, and cost-effective measures for the treatment of symptomatic and early diagnosis and isolation of asymptomatic cases/contacts are strongly recommended because of low ascertainment rate and large number of infected cases. We additionally recommend that traffic restriction be combined with other controlling measures. © 2020 RIGLD, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases.","Olfatifar, M.; Alali, W.

457279,Forward-focused coping predicts better mental health outcomes in mid- to late-life during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Many breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening programmes were disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to estimate the effects of five restart strategies after the disruption on required screening capacity and cancer burden. METHODS: Microsimulation models simulated five restart strategies for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. The models estimated required screening capacity, cancer incidence, and cancer-specific mortality after a disruption of 6 months. The restart strategies varied in whether screens were caught up or not and, if so, immediately or delayed, and whether the upper age limit was increased. RESULTS: The disruption in screening programmes without catch-up of missed screens led to an increase of 2.0, 0.3, and 2.5 cancer deaths per 100 000 individuals in 10 years in breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer, respectively. Immediately catching-up missed screens minimised the impact of the disruption but required a surge in screening capacity. Delaying screening, but still offering all screening rounds gave the best balance between required capacity, incidence, and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies with the smallest loss in health effects were also the most burdensome for the screening organisations. Which strategy is preferred depends on the organisation and available capacity in a country.","Kregting, Lindy M; Kaljouw, Sylvia; de Jonge, Lucie; Jansen, Erik E L; Peterse, Elisabeth F P; Heijnsdijk, Eveline A M; van Ravesteyn, Nicolien T; Lansdorp-Vogelaar, Iris; de Kok, Inge M C M",Br J Cancer,,130

At present we are passing through a phase of slow and painful understanding of the origin, epidemiological profile, clinical spectrum, and risk profile of the virus. To the best of our knowledge there is only limited and contradictory evidence concerning SARS-CoV-2 transmission through other routes. Importantly, the eye may constitute not only a potential site of virus replication but also an alternative transmission route of the virus from the ocular surface to the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. It is therefore imperative to gain a better insight into the potential ophthalmological transmission route of the virus and establish directions on best practice and future models of care for ophthalmological patients. This review article critically evaluates available evidence on the ophthalmological mode of viral transmission and the value of earlier identification of the virus on the eye. More evidence is urgently needed to better evaluate the need for protective measures and reliable ocular diagnostic tests to diminish further pandemic spread.","Güemes-Villahoz, Noemi; Burgos-Blasco, Barbara; Vidal-Villegas, Beatriz; Garcia-Feijoo, Julián; Arriola-Villalobos, Pedro; Martínez-de-la-Casa, Jose María; Diaz-Valle, David; Konstas, Anastasios G",Adv Ther,,130

We detail the challenges and considerations involved in the preparation of a disaster response plan in situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which dramatically increase demand for nephrology services. Taking careful inventory of all aspects of an RRT program (personnel, consumables, and machines) before a surge in RRT arises and developing disaster contingency protocol anticoagulation and for shared RRT models when absolutely necessary are paramount to a successful response to such a disaster.","Stevens, Jacob S; Velez, Juan Carlos Q; Mohan, Sumit",Sem. dial,,130

DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: A single ward of a tertiary-care public hospital in Melbourne, Australia. INTERVENTION: Glycerin-based aerosol was used as a surrogate for respiratory aerosols. The transmission of aerosols from a single patient room into corridors and a nurses' station in the ward was measured. The rate of clearance of aerosols was measured over time from the patient room, nurses' station and ward corridors with and without air cleaners [ie, portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters]. RESULTS: Aerosols rapidly travelled from the patient room into other parts of the ward. Air cleaners were effective in increasing the clearance of aerosols from the air in clinical spaces and reducing their spread to other areas. With 2 small domestic air cleaners in a single patient room of a hospital ward, 99% of aerosols could be cleared within 5.5 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Air cleaners may be useful in clinical spaces to help reduce the risk of acquisition of respiratory viruses that are transmitted via aerosols. They are easy to deploy and are likely to be cost-effective in a variety of healthcare settings.","Buising, Kristy L; Schofield, Robyn; Irving, Louis; Keywood, Melita; Stevens, Ashley; Keogh, Nick; Skidmore, Grant; Wadlow, Imogen; Kevin, Kevin; Rismanchi, Behzad; Wheeler, Amanda J; Humphries, Ruhi S; Kainer, Marion; Monty, Jason; McGain, Forbes; Marshall, Caroline",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,130

Till date, no potential medicine/ drug is available to cure the infected persons from SARS-CoV-2. This deadly virus is named as novel 2019-nCoV coronavirus and caused coronavirus disease, that is, COVID-19. The first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human was confirmed in the Wuhan city of the China. COVID-19 is an infectious disease and spread from man to man as well as surface to man . In the present work, in silico approach was followed to find potential molecule to control this infection. Authors have screened more than one million molecules available in the ZINC database and taken the best two compounds based on binding energy score. These lead molecules were further studied through docking against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Then, molecular dynamics simulations of the main protease with and without screened compounds were performed at room temperature to determine the thermodynamic parameters to understand the inhibition. Further, molecular dynamics simulations at different temperatures were performed to understand the efficiency of the inhibition of the main protease in the presence of the screened compounds. Change in energy for the formation of the complexes between the main protease of novel coronavirus and ZINC20601870 as well ZINC00793735 at room temperature was determined on applying MM-GBSA calculations. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed their antiviral potential and may inhibit viral replication experimentally. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

462031,Mental health of mental health professionals during COVID-19 pandemic: Who cares for it?,2020,"Events like the COVID-19 pandemic can become what Assa Doron and Robin Jeffrey have called ‘binding crises’: ‘events with the clarity and immediacy of a terrifying threat’ (2018: 12), impacting the rich and the poor, the powerful and the powerless – though unevenly. Binding crises of the past (like the 1842 Great Fire of Hamburg, the 1858 Great Stink in London and the 1896 Bombay plague) have led to ubiquitous reforms in sanitation and waste management practices, most notably landmark innovations in modern sewerage systems. In what follows, I draw on ethnographic research, conducted discontinuously over five years (2015–2019), around municipal solid waste management (MSWM), and the political ecology of informal plastic recycling in the city of Ahmedabad, India. I argue that the current pandemic may constitute such a binding event as freelance waste-collection networks are paralysed by the lockdown and ‘authorised’ modes of waste collection are prioritised, leading to a novel ‘infrastructuring’ of emerging relations between human bodies and wasted things.","Dey, Tridibesh",Journal of Legal Anthropology,,130

DESIGN: Descriptive cross-sectional study. SETTING: Online survey conducted between April 9 and April 30, 2020, during the COVD-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: About 1,046 older adults over the age of 50 who live in North America. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were asked about their basic demographic information, current health status, and the impact of the current SDG on their subjective state of mental health. Participants completed the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, to determine the amount and intensity of physical activity performed, as well as both the Geriatric Depression Scale and Geriatric Anxiety Scale, to ascertain the extent of their depression and anxiety-like symptoms. RESULTS: Ninety-seven percent of participants indicated that they adhered to current SDG ""Most of the time"" or ""Strictly."" Participants who performed greater levels of physical activity experienced lower levels of depression-like symptoms when age, sex, and education were accounted for; however, no relationship between physical activity and anxiety-like symptoms was found. A hierarchical regression analysis that incorporated the intensity of physical activity performed (light, moderate, and vigorous) in the model indicated that greater light and strenuous activity, but not moderate, predicted lower depression-like symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that performing even light physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic may help alleviate some of the negative mental health impacts that older adults may be experiencing while isolated and adhering to SDG during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Callow, Daniel D; Arnold-Nedimala, Naomi A; Jordan, Leslie S; Pena, Gabriel S; Won, Junyeon; Woodard, John L; Smith, J Carson",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,,130

We sought to characterize the GI manifestations of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in oncology patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a multicenter cohort study of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in 9 Massachusetts medical centers and identified those with an active malignancy. We evaluated the prevalence and severity of GI symptoms among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cancer. RESULTS: Of 395 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 36 (9%) had an active malignancy. Of the 36 cancer patients, 23 (63%) reported &#8805;1 new GI symptom. The most prevalent symptoms were anorexia (12, 52%), diarrhea (9, 39%), and vomiting (8, 35%). GI symptoms were the initial symptom in 4/36 (11%) patients, were the predominant symptom in 5/36 (14%) patients, and were severe in 4/23 (17%) patients. Four of 5 patients with GI symptoms at presentation reported concurrent fever; notably 1 patient had no fever or respiratory symptoms. Twelve (33%) patients had elevations in liver transaminases at presentation; patients with elevated transaminases were more likely to have associated GI symptoms (83% vs. 54%, P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Acute GI symptoms associated with COVID-19 are highly prevalent in hospitalized cancer patients and can occur as a presenting symptom without respiratory symptoms. Symptoms are severe in a small subset of patients.","Grover, Shilpa; Redd, Walker D; Zhou, Joyce C; Nije, Cheikh; Wong, Danny; Hathorn, Kelly E; McCarty, Thomas R; Bazarbashi, Ahmad N; Shen, Lin; Chan, Walter W",J Clin Gastroenterol,,130

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective evaluation of patients admitted with COVID-19 to one site in March 2020. Patients were stratified into 3 groups: survivors who did not receive mechanical ventilation (MV), survivors who received MV, and those who received MV and died during hospitalization. RESULTS: There were 140 hospitalizations; 22 deaths (mortality rate 15.7%), 83 (59%) survived and did not receive MV, 35 (25%) received MV and survived; 18 (12.9%) received MV and died. Thee mean age of each group was 57.8, 55.8 and 72.7 years, respectively (Pâ¯=â¯.0001). Of those who received MV and died, 61% were male (P = .01).

468413,Primary healthcare clinicians,2021,"The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become the main target for antiviral and vaccine development. Despite its relevance, e information is scarse about its evolutionary traces. The aim of this study was to investigate the diversification patterns of the spike for each clade of SARS-CoV-2 through different approaches. Two thousand and one hundred sequences representing the seven clades of the SARS-CoV-2 were included. Patterns of genetic diversifications and nucleotide evolutionary rate were estimated for the spike genomic region. The haplotype networks showed a star shape, where multiple haplotypes with few nucleotide differences diverge from a common ancestor. Four hundred seventy-nine different haplotypes were defined in the seven analyzed clades. The main haplotype, named Hap-1, was the most frequent for clades G (54%), GH (54%), and GR (56%) and a different haplotype (named Hap-252) was the most important for clades L (63.3%), O (39.7%), S (51.7%), and V (70%). The evolutionary rate for the spike protein was estimated as 1.08 × 10-3 nucleotide substitutions/site/year. Moreover, the nucleotide evolutionary rate after nine months of the pandemic was similar for each clade. In conclusion, the present evolutionary analysis is relevant as the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the target for most therapeutic candidates; besides, changes in this protein could have consequences on viral transmission, response to antivirals and efficacy of vaccines. Moreover, the evolutionary characterization of clades improves knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and deserves to be assessed in more detail as re-infection by different phylogenetic clades has been reported.","Pereson, Matías J; Flichman, Diego M; Martínez, Alfredo P; Baré, Patricia; Garcia, Gabriel H; Di Lello, Federico A",J. med. virol,,130
468568,"Relationship between Mental Health Diagnoses and COVID-19 Test Positivity, Hospitalization, and Mortality in Southeast Wisconsin",2021,"In December 2019, a novel human-infecting coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was recognized in China. In a few months, SARS-CoV-2 has caused thousands of disease cases and deaths in several countries. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that SARS-CoV-2 clusters with SARS-CoV in the Sarbecovirus subgenus and viruses related to SARS-CoV-2 were identified from bats and pangolins. Coronaviruses have long and complex genomes with high plasticity in terms of gene content. To date, the coding potential of SARS-CoV-2 remains partially unknown. We thus used available sequences of bat and pangolin viruses to determine the selective events that shaped the genome structure of SARS-CoV-2 and to assess its coding potential. By searching for signals of significantly reduced variability at synonymous sites (dS), we identified six genomic regions, one of these corresponding to the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift. The most prominent signal of dS reduction was observed within the E gene. A genome-wide analysis of conserved RNA structures indicated that this region harbors a putative functional RNA element that is shared with the SARS-CoV lineage. Additional signals of reduced dS indicated the presence of internal ORFs. Whereas the presence ORF9a (internal to N) was previously proposed by homology with a well characterized protein of SARS-CoV, ORF3h (for hypothetical, within ORF3a) was not previously described. The predicted product of ORF3h has 90% identity with the corresponding predicted product of SARS-CoV and displays features suggestive of a viroporin. Finally, analysis of the putative ORF10 revealed high dN/dS (3.82) in SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses. In the SARS-CoV lineage, the ORF is predicted to encode a truncated protein and is neutrally evolving. These data suggest that ORF10 encodes a functional protein in SARS-CoV-2 and that positive selection is driving its evolution. Experimental analyses will be necessary to validate and characterize the coding and non-coding functional elements we identified.","Cagliani, Rachele; Forni, Diego; Clerici, Mario; Sironi, Manuela",Infect Genet Evol,,130

The primary outcome was time to COVID-19 death, defined as confirmed or suspected COVID-19 death as per death certification. Two periods were used: (1) Jan 24 to April 30, 2020, and (2) May 1 to July 28, 2020. We assessed the performance of the QCovid algorithms using measures of discrimination and calibration. Using predicted 90-day risk of COVID-19 death, we calculated r2 values, Brier scores, and measures of discrimination and calibration with corresponding 95% CIs over the two time periods.

Currently, the COVID-19 epidemic shows the importance of taking into account the spatial dynamic of epidemics and pandemics. In this contribution, we consider a multi-region discrete-time epidemic model that describes the spatial spread of an epidemic within different geographical zones assumed to be connected with the movements of their populations. Based on the fact that there are several limitations in medical resources, the authorities and health decision-makers must define a threshold of infections in order to determine if a zone is epidemic or not yet. We propose a new approach of optimal control by defining new importance functions to identify affected zones and then the need for the control intervention. Numerical results are provided to illustrate our findings by applying this new approach in two adjacent regions of Morocco, the Casablanca-Settat and Rabat-Sale-Kenitra regions. We investigate different scenarios to show the most effective scenario, based on thresholds' values.","Boutayeb, H.; Bidah, S.; Zakary, O.; Lhous, M.; Rachik, M.",Communications in Mathematical Biology and Neuroscience,,130

476519,Sedentary Behavior among 6–14-Year-Old Children during the COVID-19 Lockdown and Its Relation to Physical and Mental Health,2021,"BACKGROUND: Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is safe and effective but is typically administered under strict clinic observation to mitigate the risk of a systemic reaction to immunotherapy (SRIT). However, in the setting of the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, alternative care models should be explored. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of home immunotherapy self-administration (HITSA) in a highly idealized circumstance for provision of maintenance AIT in a shelter-in-place or other scenarios of unforeseen reduction in nonessential medical services. METHODS: Markov modeling was used to compare in-office clinic AIT in selected patients using cohort analysis and microsimulation from the societal and health care perspectives. RESULTS: Assuming similar SRIT rates, HITSA was found to be a cost-effective option with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $44,554/quality-adjusted life-year when considering both incremental epinephrine autoinjector costs and coronavirus disease 2019 risks. Excluding epinephrine autoinjector costs, HISTA dominated other options. However, outside of pandemic considerations, HITSA was not cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $198,877,286) at annual epinephrine autoinjector costs above $287. As the incremental HITSA SRIT rate increased above 15%, clinic AIT was the most cost-effective strategy. Excluding both pandemic risks and risk of motor vehicle accident fatality from round-trip clinic transit, clinic AIT dominated other strategies. Clinic AIT was the more cost-effective option at very high fatality relative risk for HITSA or at very low annual risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Under idealized assumptions HITSA can be a safe and cost-effective option during a global pandemic in appropriately selected patients provided home rates of SRIT remain stable.","Shaker, Marcus S; Mosnaim, Giselle; Oppenheimer, John; Stukus, David; Abrams, Elissa M; Greenhawt, Matthew",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,,130

To date, several sphingolipid derivatives are known, but S1P (Sphingosine-1-phosphate) and Ceramide are the best-studied sphingolipid derivatives in the context of human diseases. These are membrane-bound lipids that influence host-pathogen interactions. Based on these features, we believe that sphingolipids might control SARS-CoV-2 infection in the host. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the ACE-II receptor (Angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptor) on epithelial cells for its entry and replication. Activation of the ACE-II receptor is indirectly associated with the activation of S1P Receptor 1 signaling which is associated with IL-6 driven fibrosis. This is expected to promote pathological responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 cases. Given this, mitigating S1P signaling by application of either S1P Lyase (SPL) or S1P analog (Fingolimod / FTY720) seems to be potential approach for controlling these pathological outcomes. However, due to the immunosuppressive nature of FTY720, it can modulate hyper-inflammatory responses and only provide symptomatic relief, which may not be sufficient for controlling the novel COVID-19 infection. Since Th1 effector immune responses are essential for the clearance of infection, we believe that other sphingolipid derivatives like Cermaide-1 Phosphate with antiviral potential and adjuvant immune potential can potentially control SARS-CoV-2 infection in the host by its ability in enhancing autophagy and antigen presentation by DC to promote T cell response which can be helpful in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection in novel COVID-19 patients.","Prakash, Hridayesh; Upadhyay, Dilip; Bandapalli, Obul Reddy; Jain, Aklank; Kleuser, Burkhard",Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat,,130

Since then, COVID-19 has become a pandemic affecting more than 4.1 million people worldwide. Patients with COVID-19 have a wide spectrum of manifestations, one being cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and its fatal correlate, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). Anti-cytokine therapy such as tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, is a potential treatment for COVID-19; however, data regarding the efficacy of this anti-IL-6 therapy are currently lacking. We report two cases of patients who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 complicated by CRS and were treated with tocilizumab. Both patients progressed to sHLH despite treatment with tocilizumab, and one developed viral myocarditis, challenging the safety and clinical usefulness of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19-induced CRS. These cases highlight the need for clinical trials to determine optimal patient selection and timing for the use of tocilizumab during this disease process.","Radbel, Jared; Narayanan, Navaneeth; Bhatt, Pinki J",Chest,,130

We argue that flight-as-fever is unlikely to explain why bats harbor more viruses than other mammals on the basis of two lines of reasoning. First, flight temperatures reported in the literature overestimate true flight temperatures because of methodologic limitations. Second, body temperatures in bats are only high relative to humans, and not relative to many other mammals. We provide examples of mammals from diverse habitats to show that temperatures in excess of 40 C during activity are quite common in species with lower viral diversity than bats. We caution scientists against stating the flight-as-fever hypothesis as unquestioned truth, as has repeatedly occurred in the popular media in the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Levesque, Danielle L; Boyles, Justin G; Downs, Cynthia J; Breit, Ana M",J Wildl Dis,,130

The survey was a self-report questionnaire, using a multistage process, which was sent to 168 heads of academic CAP services in 24 European countries. Eighty-two responses (56 complete) from 20 countries, representing the subjective judgement of heads of CAP centers, were received between mid-April and mid-May 2020. Most respondents judged the impact of the crisis on the mental health of their patients as medium (52%) or strong (33%). A large majority of CAP services reported no COVID-19 positive cases among their inpatients and most respondents declared no or limited sick leaves in their team due to COVID-19. Outpatient, daycare, and inpatient units experienced closures or reductions in the number of treated patients throughout Europe. In addition, a lower referral rate was observed in most countries. Respondents considered that they were well equipped to handle COVID-19 patients despite a lack of protective equipment. Telemedicine was adopted by almost every team despite its sparse use prior to the crisis. Overall, these first results were surprisingly homogeneous, showing a substantially reduced patient load and a moderate effect of the COVID-19 crisis on psychopathology. The effect on the organization of CAP services appears profound. COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the adoption of new technologies, including telepsychiatry.","Revet, Alexis; Hebebrand, Johannes; Anagnostopoulos, Dimitris; Kehoe, Laura A; Klauser, Paul",Eur. child adolesc. psychiatry,,130

The VTM that was urgently required needed to support viral replication, as well as other routine diagnostic approaches. We describe the preparation and validation testing of VTM for rapidly expanding diagnostic testing, where the capacity of the VTM to preserve viral integrity, for culture, isolation and full sequence analysis, was maintained. METHODS: VTM was prepared using different methods of sterilization then 'spiked' with virus. The VTM was investigated using viral culture in Vero cells, and for nucleic acid detection by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: The best results were obtained by filter and autoclave-based sterilization. The VTM proved robust for culture-based analyses provided the inoculated VTM was stored at 4 °C, and tested within 48 h. The filtered VTM also supported PCR-based diagnosis for at least 5 days when the mock inoculated VTM was held at room temperature. DISCUSSION: The manual handling of VTM production, including filling and sterilization, was optimized. SARS-CoV-2 was spiked into VTM to assess different sterilization methods and measure the effects of storage time and temperature upon VTM performance. While most diagnostic protocols will not require replication competent virus, the use of high quality VTM will allow for the next phase of laboratory analysis in the COVID-19 pandemic, including drug and antibody susceptibility analysis of re-isolated SARS-CoV-2, and for the testing of vaccine escape mutants.","McAuley, Julie; Fraser, Claire; Paraskeva, Elena; Trajcevska, Elizabeth; Sait, Michelle; Wang, Nancy; Bert, Eric; Purcell, Damian; Strugnell, Richard",Virol J,,130

While most diagnostic protocols will not require replication competent virus, the use of high quality VTM will allow for the next phase of laboratory analysis in the COVID-19 pandemic, including drug and antibody susceptibility analysis of re-isolated SARS-CoV-2, and for the testing of vaccine escape mutants.","McAuley, Julie; Fraser, Claire; Paraskeva, Elena; Trajcevska, Elizabeth; Sait, Michelle; Wang, Nancy; Bert, Eric; Purcell, Damian; Strugnell, Richard",Virol J,,130

488392,Tackling COVID-19 in the Eastern Mediterranean Region,2020,"When studying the dynamics of morbidity and mortality, one should not limit ourselves to analyzing general trends. Interesting information can be obtained from the analysis of deviations in morbidity and mortality from the general dynamics. Comparison of the cases of morbidity or death for adjacent time intervals allows us to find out whether the changes in conditions were for short periods of time and whether the cases of morbidity or death were independent. The article consists of two parts: Study of the probability distribution (CDF) of the difference between two independent observations of the Poisson distribution;Application of the results to analyze the morbidity and mortality trends by day for the new coronavirus infection. For the distribution function of the module of difference between two independent observations of the Poisson distribution, an analytical expression has been obtained that allows to get an exact solution. A program has been created, whose software can be downloaded at http://1mgmu.com/nau/DeltaPoisson/ DeltaPoisson.zip. An approximate solution that does not require complex calculations has also been obtained, which can be used for an average of more than 20. If real difference is greater than expected, it may be in the following cases: Morbidity or mortality varies considerably during the day. That could happen, for example, if the registered number of morbidity on Saturday and Sunday is less than on weekdays due to the management model of the health system, or if the cases are not independent;for example, due to the active identification of infected people among those who have come into contact with the patient. If the difference is less than expected, it may be due to external limiting factors, such as a shortage of test systems for making a diagnosis, a limited number of pathologists to determine the cause of death, and so on. In the analysis of the actual data for COVID-19 it was found that for Poland and Russia, excluding Moscow, the difference in the number of cases and deaths is greater than expected, while for Moscow-less than expected. This may be due to the information policy-the effort to somehow reassure Moscow's population, which in the spring of 2020 had a high incidence rate of the new coronavirus infection.","Gerasimov, A.; Galkina, E.; Danilova, E.; Ikonnikova, I.; Novoselova, T.; Orlov, Y.

488827,The Impact of COVID-19 on Adolescent Mental Health: Preliminary Findings From a Longitudinal Sample of Healthy and At-Risk Adolescents,2021,"BACKGROUND: Increased incidence of out-of-hospital sudden death (OHSD) has been reported during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. New York City (NYC) represents a unique opportunity to examine the epidemiologic association between the two given the variable regional distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in its highly diverse neighborhoods. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden during the first COVID-19 pandemic across the highly diverse neighborhoods of NYC. METHODS: The incidences of OHSD between March 20 and April 22, 2019, and between March 20 and April 22, 2020, as reported by the Fire Department of New York were obtained. As a surrogate for viral epidemiologic burden, we used percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests performed between March 3 and August 20, 2020. Data were reported separately for the 176 zip codes of NYC. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were performed between the 2 measures to examine association. RESULTS: Incidence of OHSD per 10,000 inhabitants and percentage of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion were highly variable across NYC neighborhoods, varying from 0.0 to 22.9 and 12.4% to 50.9%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed a moderate positive correlation between neighborhood data on OHSD and percentage of positive antibody tests to SARS-CoV-2 (Spearman &#961; 0.506; P <.001). Regression analysis showed that seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 and OHSD in 2019 were independent predictors for OHSD during the first epidemic surge in NYC (R2 = 0.645). CONCLUSION: The association in geographic distribution between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden suggests either a causality between the 2 syndromes or the presence of local determinants affecting both measures in a similar fashion.","Coleman, Kristie M; Saleh, Moussa; Mountantonakis, Stavros E",Heart Rhythm,,130

METHODS: Patients who suffered from fractures or soft-tissue trauma between March 21, 2020, and June 1, 2020, (group pandemic) and during the same period in 2019 (control group) were included in our single-center retrospective study. Each group was also divided into 3 subgroups according to the age of patients (&#8804; 20 years, 21-64 years, and &#8805; 65 years). Data including anatomical region subjected to trauma, place of admission, mechanism of trauma, location of trauma, mode of treatment, type of surgery (if performed), duration of hospitalization (if hospitalized), time elapsed until surgery, and duration of postoperative hospitalization were collected and compared between groups. RESULTS: A total of 361 patients were admitted to the hospital with new trauma during the pandemic, and 708 patients had been admitted during the same period in 2019. The number of admissions decreased significantly by 50.9% (P < 0.001). The mechanism of trauma that occurred with low energy was significantly increased in the pandemic group (73.9%) compared with the control group (47.6%) (P < 0.001). Similarly, the distribution of trauma throughout the skeletal system, especially in the upper extremity, was significantly increased in the pandemic group (49.9% vs. 30.5%, P < 0.001). However, there was no significant decrease in individuals aged above 65 years (P = 0.115). Similar to the general outlook, the 3 groups differed in terms of the mechanism of trauma, location of trauma, and distribution of the anatomical region subjected to trauma (P < 0.001). Majority of the patients received inpatient treatment in all 3 groups (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the pandemic dramatically reduced the number of hospital admissions related to orthopedic trauma. The rate of low energy, upper extremity traumas that occurred indoors increased during the pandemic period compared with that of the previous year. However, the rate of hospital admissions did not differ in the &#8805;65-year-old subgroup during the pandemic period compared with that of the previous year.","Kalem, Mahmut; Kocaoglu, Hakan; Merter, Abdullah; Karaca, Mustafa Onur; Özbek, Emre Anil; Kinik, Hüseyin Hakan",Acta Orthop Traumatol Turc,,130

Here we evaluate the long-term stability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies following infection with SARS-CoV-2 in 402 adult donors. MethodsWe performed a multi-center study carried out at Plasma Donor Centers in the city of Heidelberg (Plasmazentrum Heidelberg, Germany) and Munich (Plasmazentrum Munchen, Germany). We present anti-S/N and anti-N IgG antibody levels in prospective serum samples collected up to 403 days post recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. ResultsThe cohort includes 402 adult donors (185 female, 217 male; 17 - 68 years of age) where anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were measured in plasma samples collected between 18- and 403-days post SARS-CoV-2 infection. A linear mixed effects model demonstrated IgG decay rates that decrease over time ({chi}2=176.8, p<0.00001) and an interaction of time*age {chi} ({chi}2=10.0, p<0.005)), with those over 60+ years showing the highest baseline IgG levels and the fastest rate of IgG decay. Baseline viral neutralization assays demonstrated that serum IgG levels correlated with in vitro neutralization capacity in 91% of our cohort. ConclusionLong-term antibody levels and age-specific antibody decay rates suggest the potential need for age-specific vaccine booster guidelines to ensure long term vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sjaarda, Calvin P; Moslinger, Emily; Tozer, Kyla; Colautti, Robert I; Kheitan, Samira; Meurant, Robyn; Cleaf, Stefanie Van; Ardakani, Ali; Bosnjak, Oliver; Ghaffari, Abdi; Sheth, Prameet M",,,130

493701,"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, access to care, and health disparities in the perinatal period",2021,"BACKGROUND: Mobile clinics have been used to deliver primary health care to populations that otherwise experience difficulty in accessing services. Indigenous populations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States experience greater health inequities than non-Indigenous populations. There is increasing support for Indigenous-governed and culturally accessible primary health care services which meet the needs of Indigenous populations. There is some support for primary health care mobile clinics implemented specifically for Indigenous populations to improve health service accessibility. The purpose of this review is to scope the literature for evidence of mobile primary health care clinics implemented specifically for Indigenous populations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. METHODS: This review was undertaken using the Joanna Brigg Institute (JBI) scoping review methodology. Review objectives, inclusion criteria and methods were specified in advance and documented in a published protocol. The search included five academic databases and an extensive search of the grey literature. RESULTS: The search resulted in 1350 unique citations, with 91 of these citations retrieved from the grey literature and targeted organisational websites. Title, abstract and full-text screening was conducted independently by two reviewers, with 123 citations undergoing full text review. Of these, 39 citations discussing 25 mobile clinics, met the inclusion criteria. An additional 14 citations were snowballed from a review of the reference lists of included citations. Of these 25 mobile clinics, the majority were implemented in Australia (n = 14), followed by United States (n = 6) and Canada (n = 5). No primary health mobile clinics specifically for Indigenous people in New Zealand were retrieved. There was a pattern of declining locations serviced by mobile clinics with an increasing population. Furthermore, only 13 mobile clinics had some form of evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: This review identifies geographical gaps in the implementation of primary health care mobile clinics for Indigenous populations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. There is a paucity of evaluations supporting the use of mobile clinics for Indigenous populations and a need for organisations implementing mobile clinics specifically for Indigenous populations to share their experiences. Engaging with the perspectives of Indigenous people accessing mobile clinic services is imperative to future evaluations.

494024,"Mental Health, Substance Use, and Wellbeing in Higher Education",2021,"Viral infectious diseases have been seriously threatening human health. The receptor binding is the first step of viral infection. Predicting virus-receptor interactions will be helpful for the interaction mechanism of viruses and receptors, and further find some effective ways of preventing and treating viral infectious diseases so as to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by viruses. Some computation algorithms have been proposed for identifying potential virus-receptor interactions. However, a common problem in those methods is the presence of noise in the similarity network. A new computational model (Network Enhancement and the Regularized Least Squares [NERLS]) is proposed to predict virus-receptor interactions based on improving similarities by Network Enhancement (NE). NERLS integrates the virus sequence similarity, the receptor sequence similarity and known virus-receptor interactions. We compute the virus sequence similarity and known virus-receptor interactions to construct the virus similarity network. The receptor similarity network is constructed by the Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity and the receptor sequence similarity. To obtain the final virus similarity network and the final receptor similarity network, NE is, respectively, applied for reducing the noise of the virus similarity network and the receptor similarity network. Finally, NERLS employs the regularized least squares to predict interactions of viruses and receptors. The experiment results show that NERLS achieves the area under curve value of 0.893 and 0.921 in 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation, respectively, which is consistently superior to four related methods [which include Initial interaction scores method via the neighbors and the Laplacian regularized Least Square (IILLS), Bi-random walk on a heterogeneous network (BRWH), Laplacian regularized least squares classifier (LapRLS), and Collaborative matrix factorization (CMF)]. Furthermore, a case study also demonstrates that NERLS effectively predicts potential virus-receptor interactions.","Zhu, Lingzhi; Yan, Cheng; Duan, Guihua",J. comput. biol,,130

METHOD: We included studies conducted in any population, describing either the impact of the closure or reopening of hospitality venues, or exposure to these venues, on the incidence or mortality from COVID-19. We used a snowball sampling approach with backward and forward citation search along with co-citations. RESULTS: We found 20 articles examining the role of hospitality venues in the epidemiology of COVID-19. Modeling studies showed that interventions reducing social contacts in indoor venues can reduce COVID-19 transmission. Studies using statistical models showed similar results, including that the closure of hospitality venues is amongst the most effective measures in reducing incidence or mortality. Case studies highlighted the role of hospitality venues in generating super-spreading events, along with the importance of airflow and ventilation inside these venues. CONCLUSIONS: We found consistent results across studies showing that the closure of hospitality venues is amongst the most effective measures to reduce the impact of COVID-19.

Yet, many existing approaches for predicting macroscopic behavior only use aggregated data, leaving a large amount of fine-grained microscopic information unused. In this paper, we propose a principled optimization framework for macroscopic prediction by fitting microscopic models based on conditional stochastic optimization. The framework leverages both macroscopic and microscopic information, and adapts to individual microscopic models involved in the aggregation. In addition, we propose efficient learning algorithms with convergence guarantees. In our experiments, we show that the proposed learning framework clearly outperforms other plug-in supervised learning approaches in real-world applications, including the prediction of daily infections of COVID-19 and medicare claims. © 2020 Neural information processing systems foundation.

495991,Fitting Community-Centered Population Health (CCPH) Into the Existing Health Care Delivery Patchwork: The Politics of CCPH,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The hypothesis of the study is that treatment with hydroxychloroquine sulphate in hospitalised patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is safe and will accelerate the virological clearance rate for patients with moderately severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) when compared to standard care. Furthermore, we hypothesize that early treatment with hydroxychloroquine sulphate is associated with more rapid resolve of clinical symptoms as assessed by the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), decreased admission rate to intensive care units and mortality, and improvement in protein biomarker profiles (C-reactive protein, markers of renal and hepatic injury, and established cardiac biomarkers like cardiac troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide). TRIAL DESIGN: The study is a two-arm, open label, pragmatic randomised controlled group sequential adaptive trial designed to assess the effect on viral loads and clinical outcome of hydroxychloroquine sulphate therapy in addition to standard care compared to standard care alone in patients with established Covid-19. By utilizing resources already paid for by the hospitals (physicians and nurses in daily clinical practice), this pragmatic trial can include a larger number of patients over a short period of time and at a lower cost than studies utilizing traditional randomized controlled trial designs with an external study organization. The pragmatic approach will enable swift initiation of randomisation and allocation to treatment. PARTICIPANTS: Patients will be recruited from all inpatients at Akershus University Hospital, Lørenskog, Norway. Electronic real-time surveillance of laboratory reports from the Department of Microbiology will be examined regularly for SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects. All of the following conditions must apply to the prospective patient at screening prior to inclusion: (1) Hospitalisation; (2) Adults 18 years or older; (3) Moderately severe Covid-19 disease (NEWS2 of 6 or less); (4) SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal swab; (5) Expected time of hospitalisation > 48 hours; and (6) Signed informed consent must be obtained and documented according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization, and national/local regulations. Patients will be excluded from participation in the study if they meet any of the following criteria: (1) Requiring intensive care unit admission at screening; (2) History of psoriasis; (3) Known adverse reaction to hydroxychloroquine sulphate; (4) Pregnancy; or (5) Prolonged corrected QT interval (>450 ms). Clinical data, including standard hospital biochemistry, medical therapy, vital signs, NEWS2, and microbiology results (including blood culture results and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] for other upper airway viruses), will be automatically extracted from the hospital electronic records and merged with the study specific database. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Included patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to (1) standard care with the addition of 400 mg hydroxychloroquine sulphate (PlaquenilTM) twice daily for seven days or (2) standard care alone. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint of the study is the rate of decline in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in oropharyngeal samples as assessed by RT-PCR in samples collected at baseline, 48 and 96 hours after randomization and administration of drug for the intervention arm. Secondary endpoints include change in NEWS2 at 96 hours after randomisation, admission to intensive care unit, mortality (in-hospital, and at 30 and 90 days), duration of hospital admission, clinical status on a 7-point ordinal scale 14 days after randomization ([1] Death [2] Hospitalised, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [3] Hospitalised, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices [4] Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen [5] Hospitalised, not requiring supplemental oxygen [6] Not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities [7] Not hospitalised, with resumption of normal activities), and improvement in protein biomarker profiles (C-reactive protein, markers of renal and hepatic injury, and established cardiac biomarkers like cardiac troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide) at 96 hours after randomization. RANDOMISATION: Eligible patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio, using a computer randomisation procedure. The allocation sequence has been prepared by an independent statistician. BLINDING (MASKING): Open label randomised controlled pragmatic trial without blinding, no active or placebo control. The virologist assessing viral load in the oropharyngeal samples and the statistician responsible for analysis of the data will be blinded to the treatment allocation for the statistical analyses.

496718,Mental Health Impact of COVID-19 in Radiation Oncology Health Care Workers of Asian Countries,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption in the sports industry and has raised the question of whether the football industry is based on a sustainable business model. Using data from the English Premier League (EPL), we develop a regression model to achieve two objectives. First, we examine the relationship between the different revenue sources (TV revenues, match revenues, and commercial revenues) and the main cost drivers of professional football clubs (player salaries and transfer expenses). Second, we seek to predict the likely impact of a major market downturn such as the COVID-19 pandemic in the EPL. Our results suggest that TV revenues are by far the most important source of income for player salaries and market values, followed by match revenues and commercial revenues. We predict that player salaries, market values, and transfer expenses will all decrease in the forthcoming EPL season, 2020/2021. The magnitude of the reduction depends on the coronavirus scenario and ranges from −20.4% to −9.5% for player salaries and −26.7% to −12.4% for player market values. Our study seeks to explore the relative impact of the three main revenue sources in the EPL on the unprecedented growth of player salaries, market values, and net transfer expenses in the last three decades. In addition, our study adds to the understanding of the pandemic’s expected impact on the EPL.","Quansah, Tommy Frick Bernd Lang Markus Maguire Kieran",Sustainability,,130

498564,Mental health before and during COVID-19 in two longitudinal UK population cohorts,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Italy has been one of the first countries to implement mitigation measures to curb the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. There is currently a debate on when and how such measures should be loosened. To forecast the demand for hospital intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU beds for COVID-19 patients from May to September, we developed 2 models, assuming a gradual easing of restrictions or an intermittent lockdown. METHODS: We used a compartmental model to evaluate 2 scenarios: (A) an intermittent lockdown; (B) a gradual relaxation of the lockdown. Predicted ICU and non-ICU demand was compared with the peak in hospital bed use observed in April 2020. RESULTS: Under scenario A, while ICU demand will remain below the peak, the number of non-ICU will substantially rise and will exceed it (133%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 94-171). Under scenario B, a rise in ICU and non-ICU demand will start in July and will progressively increase over the summer 2020, reaching 95% (95% CI: 71-121) and 237% (95% CI: 191-282) of the April peak. CONCLUSIONS: Italian hospital demand is likely to remain high in the next months. If restrictions are reduced, planning for the next several months should consider an increase in health-care resources to maintain surge capacity across the country.","Bollon, Jordy; Paganini, Matteo; Nava, Consuelo Rubina; De Vita, Nello; Vaschetto, Rosanna; Ragazzoni, Luca; Della Corte, Francesco; Barone-Adesi, Francesco",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,130
499598,"The impact of COVID-19 on people with autism, learning disabilities and mental health conditions",2020,"The objective of this work is to provide a sophisticated but accessible compartmental epidemic model. Our algorithm is highly inspired from the compartmental model developed by Sofonea and al. in 2020. This model has been used as a reference for several working groups in France during the Covid-19 crisis. Each individual is allocated to a compartment according to her age, her current state with respect to the disease, as well as the length of time she has been in that state. The model then reproduces the mechanisms of transition from one state to another: mathematically, this translates into a system of recurrence relations. It captures how much individuals interact with one another through a parameter that estimates compliance with hygiene measures and lifestyle habits. The present work aims to make the model implementation fully transparent as well as the corresponding code available and give control to users so that they are able to test the model in total transparency. Focus has been put on reproducibility and explanation of the various parameters. The hard-coded parameters correspond to the data for the Covid-19 epidemic in France. © 2021 IPOL & the authors.","Baron, A. F.; Boulant, O.; Panico, I.; Vayatis, N.",Image Processing On Line,,130

As the first city struck by the COVID-19 outbreak, Wuhan had implemented unprecedented public health interventions. The mental health of pregnant women during these anti-epidemic controls remains unknown. A total of 274 pregnant women living in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak took part in our investigation online. The data on mental health conditions were evaluated using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We also collected the information on physical health status and precautionary measures against COVID-19. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and poor sleep quality was 16.1%, 13.9%, 42.7%, 37.6%, respectively. Comparing to SAS, PSQI score in pregnant women who participated in the survey after April 8 (date of Wuhan reopening), those data collected before April 8 were significantly higher. High levels of stress, severe health concerns over the fetus, and poor hygienic practices were negatively associated with mental health conditions. In conclusion, a large proportion of pregnant women reported psychological symptoms during the epidemic, which negatively related to the severe health concerns over fetus and poor hygienic practices. More psychological support during the epidemic would promote maternal mental well-being.","Xu, Ke; Zhang, Ya; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Xu, Qiao; Lv, Lan; Zhang, Jianduan",Psychiatry Res,,130

500972,What factors influence mental health burden in patients recovering from Covid-19?,2021,"BackgroundPeople who inject drugs may be at elevated SARS-CoV-2 risk due to their living conditions and/or exposures when seeking or using drugs. No study to date has reported upon risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among people who inject drugs or sex workers. Methods and FindingsBetween October, 2020 and June, 2021, participants aged [≥]18 years from San Diego, California, USA and Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico who injected drugs within the last month underwent interviews and testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies. Binomial regressions identified correlates of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Of 386 participants, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 36.3% (95% CI: 31.5%-41.1%); 92.1% had detectable IgM antibodies. Only 37.5% had previously been tested. Seroprevalence did not differ by country of residence. None tested RNA-positive. Most (89.5%) reported engaging in [≥]1 protective behavior [e.g., facemasks (73.5%), social distancing (46.5%), or increasing handwashing/sanitizers (22.8%)]. In a multivariate model controlling for sex, older age, and Hispanic/Latinx/Mexican ethnicity were independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, as was engaging in sex work (AdjRR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.18-2.27) and having been incarcerated in the past six months (AdjRR: 1.49; 95% CI: 0.97-2.27). Presence of comorbidities and substance using behaviors were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. ConclusionsThis is the first study to show that sex work and incarceration were independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite engaging in protective measures, over one-third had evidence of infection, reinforcing the need for a coordinated binational response. Risk mitigation and vaccination is especially needed among older and Hispanic people who inject drugs and those with less agency to protect themselves, such as those who are sex workers or incarcerated.","Strathdee, Steffanie Ann; Abramovitz, Daniela; Harvey-Vera, Alicia; Vera, Carlos; Rangel, Gudelia; Artamonova, Irina; Chaillon, Antoine; Ignacio, Caroline; Calderon, Alheli; Martin, Natasha K.; Patterson, Thomas L.",,,130

502011,Adaptations and Innovations to Minimize Service Disruption for Patients with Severe Mental Illness during COVID-19: Perspectives and Reflections from an Assertive Community Psychiatry Program,2020,"As part of the national influenza pandemic preparedness, surveillance systems have been established in Germany in addition to the mandatory notifications according to the Protection Against Infection Act. The aim of these systems is the description, analysis, and evaluation of the epidemiology of acute respiratory infections (ARIs), the identification of the circulating viruses, and the trend. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the systems have been expanded to enable monitoring of infections with SARS-CoV­2.Three systems are presented: GrippeWeb, the primary care sentinel Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza with its electronic reporting module SEEDARE, and the ICD-10-based hospital sentinel ICOSARI. With these systems, ARIs can be monitored at the population, outpatient, and inpatient levels. In combination with the monitoring of mortality, these systems provide important information on the frequency of different stages of disease severity in the population. In order to expand the systems to SARS-CoV­2, only a few adjustments were needed.As the case definitions for ARIs were preserved, historical baselines of the systems can still be used for comparison. All systems are structured in such a way that stable and established reference values are available for calculating weekly proportions and rates.This is an important addition to the mandatory reporting system of infectious diseases in Germany, which depends on the particular testing strategy, the number of tests performed, and on specific case definitions, which are adapted as required.The surveillance systems have proven to be feasible and efficient in the COVID-19 pandemic, even when compared internationally.","Goerlitz, Luise; Tolksdorf, Kristin; Buchholz, Udo; Prahm, Kerstin; Preuß, Ute; An der Heiden, Matthias; Wolff, Thorsten; Dürrwald, Ralf; Nitsche, Andreas; Michel, Janine; Haas, Walter; Buda, Silke",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,130

However, age-dependent differences in immune function require careful evaluation of novel vaccines in the pediatric population. Toward this goal, we assessed the safety and immunogenicity of two SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Two groups of 8 infant rhesus macaques (RMs) were immunized intramuscularly at weeks 0 and 4 with stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S-2P spike (S) protein encoded by mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNP) or the purified S protein mixed with 3M-052, a synthetic TLR7/8 agonist in a squalene emulsion (Protein+3M-052-SE). Neither vaccine induced adverse effects. Both vaccines elicited high magnitude IgG binding to RBD, N terminus domain, S1, and S2, ACE2 blocking activity, and high neutralizing antibody titers, all peaking at week 6. S-specific memory B cells were detected by week 4 and S-specific T cell responses were dominated by the production of IL-17, IFN-Î³, or TNF-&#945;. Antibody and cellular responses were stable through week 22. The immune responses for the mRNA-LNP vaccine were of a similar magnitude to those elicited by the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine in adults. The S-2P mRNA-LNP and Protein-3M-052-SE vaccines were well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in infant RMs, providing proof-of concept for a pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with the potential for durable immunity that might decrease the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and mitigate the ongoing health and socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19.","Garrido, Carolina; Curtis, Alan D; Dennis, Maria; Pathak, Sachi H; Gao, Hongmei; Montefiori, David; Tomai, Mark; Fox, Christopher B; Kozlowski, Pamela A; Scobey, Trevor; Munt, Jennifer E; Mallory, Michael L; Saha, Pooja T; Hudgens, Michael G; Lindesmith, Lisa C; Baric, Ralph S; Abiona, Olubukola M; Graham, Barney; Corbett, Kizzmekia S; Edwards, Darin; Carfi, Andrea; Fouda, Genevieve; Van Rompay, Koen K A; De Paris, Kristina; Permar, Sallie R",Sci. immunol,,130

To understand the COVID-19 outbreak in China and provide potential lessons for other parts of the world, in this study we apply a mathematical model with multiple datasets to estimate the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the severity of the illness associated with the infection, and how both were affected by unprecedented control measures. Our analyses show that before 19th January 2020, 3.5% (95% CI 1.7-8.3%) of infected people were detected; this percentage increased to 36.6% (95% CI 26.1-55.4%) thereafter. The basic reproduction number (R0) was 2.33 (95% CI 1.96-3.69) before 8th February 2020; then the effective reproduction number dropped to 0.04(95% CI 0.01-0.10). This estimation also indicates that control measures taken since 23rd January 2020 affected the transmissibility about 2 weeks after they were introduced. The confirmed case fatality rate is estimated at 9.6% (95% CI 8.1-11.4%) before 15 February 2020, and then it reduced to 0.7% (95% CI 0.4-1.0%). This shows that SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly transmissible but may be less severe than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. We found that at the early stage, the majority of R0 comes from undetected infectious people. This implies that successful control in China was achieved through reducing the contact rates among people in the general population and increasing the rate of detection and quarantine of the infectious cases.","Zhang, Xu-Sheng; Vynnycky, Emilia; Charlett, Andre; De Angelis, Daniela; Chen, Zhengji; Liu, Wei",Sci Rep,,130

The trend of miniaturization in optoelectronics has forced the feature sizes of the electronic components to shrink accordingly. Therefore, atomically thin InSe crystals may play an important role in future optoelectronics. Given the instability and ultralow photoluminescent (PL) emission of mechanically exfoliated ultrathin InSe, synthesis of highly stable mono- and few-layer InSe nanosheets with high PL efficiency has become crucial. Herein, ultrathin InSe nanosheets were prepared via thermal annealing of electrochemically intercalated products from bulk InSe. The size and yield of the as-prepared nanosheets were up to â¼160 µm and â¼70%, respectively, and â¼80% of the nanosheets were less than five layer. Impressively, the as-prepared nanosheets showed greatly enhanced stability and PL emission because of surface modification by carbon species. Efficient photoresponsivity of 2 A/W was achieved in the as-prepared nanosheet-based devices.

This commentary aims to describe how existing childcare problems were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially impacting both the health and economics of farm households and farmworker families. For solutions to be successful, efforts will need to be collaborative, with federal interventions spurred on by childcare stakeholders. Successful collaborations will result in a better childcare system that nurtures children while their parents contribute to our nation's production of agricultural products.","Salzwedel, Marsha; Liebman, Amy; Kruse, Kate; Lee, Barbara",J Agromedicine,,130

We performed a literature review which was undertaken from 16 June to 22 November 2020. We reviewed the available evidence on imported cases from Iran, in the electronic databases PubMed and Google Scholar, as well as gray literature. It is shown that 125 cases were imported from Iran, out of which most of the imported cases were asymptomatic, and PCR testing was the most common method of detection. It was also found that more than half of the imported cases were not quarantined or isolated at home. The review revealed that many countries, especially the Middle East had imported cases from Iran. The big gap between the date of arrival at the airport and the date of diagnosis emphasizes the importance of early detection and quarantine measures, to stop the spread of the virus.","Abdalla, Tasnim Aboujabal Khaled Abdelnaby Menatella Bashir Rim Wanas Yara Farag Elmoubasher",Epidemiologia,,130

The IBV S-ectodomain protein, which is S excluding the transmembrane anchor and short cytoplasmic domain of S2, expressed from recombinant LS corresponds to an Arkansas (Ark)-type IBV. In a first experiment, chickens were primed at 1 day of age or primed at 1 day of age and boosted at 14 days of age with 104 50% embryo infectious doses (EID50)/bird of rLS/IBV.Se and challenged with a virulent Ark strain. A single vaccination proved completely ineffective at protecting chickens against challenge, whereas priming and boosting reduced clinical signs and tracheal lesions but did not reduce viral load in lachrymal fluids. In experiment 2, the vaccine dose was increased to 107 EID50/bird and a different virulent Ark strain was used for challenge. In addition, chickens were singly immunized on either day 1 or day 10 after hatch. NDV antibody levels detected in vaccinated chickens were moderate, with hemagglutination inhibition titers varying between 4 and 5 log2. Slightly higher antibody levels to NDV were observed in chickens vaccinated on day 10 versus day 1 but without the difference achieving statistical significance. In contrast, antibody responses measured using recombinant IBV S1 protein-coated ELISA plates were significantly greater in chickens vaccinated on day 10 than on day 1. The use of a higher rLS/IBV.Se dose substantially enhanced the success of a single vaccination compared to experiment 1. Signs and tracheal lesions were reduced more effectively in chickens vaccinated at day 10 after hatch. However, as in experiment 1, vaccination did not reduce the viral loads in tear fluids of challenged chickens. Similar results, in which no reduction in viral load in the trachea was apparent from rLS/IBV.S vaccination, have been obtained by others. Further work is needed to understand the immune responses induced by this recombinant virus that seems to provide some protection against the disease but does not reduce viral loads in the upper respiratory tract.","Zegpi, R A; He, L; Yu, Q; Joiner, K S; van Santen, V L; Toro, H",Avian Dis,,130

Detailed line-list data with household settings can advance the understanding of COVID-19 transmission dynamics. METHODS: A unique database with detailed demographic characteristics, travel history, social relationships, and epidemiological timelines for 1,407 transmission pairs that formed 643 transmission clusters in mainland China was reconstructed from 9,120 COVID-19 confirmed cases reported during January 15 - February 29, 2020. Statistical model fittings were used to identify the super-spreaders and estimate serial interval distributions. Age and gender-stratified hazard of infection were estimated for household versus non-household transmissions. RESULTS: There were 34 primary cases identified as super-spreaders, with 5 super-spreading events occurred within households. Mean and standard deviation of serial intervals were estimated as 5.0 (95% CrI: 4.4, 5.5) and 5.2 (95% CrI: 4.9, 5.7) days for household transmissions and 5.2 (95% CrI: 4.6, 5.8) and 5.3 (95% CrI: 4.9, 5.7) days for non-household transmissions, respectively. Hazard of being infected outside of households is higher for age between 18 and 64 years, whereas hazard of being infected within households is higher for young and old people. CONCLUSIONS: Non-negligible frequency of super-spreading events, short serial intervals, and a higher risk of being infected outside of households for male people of working age indicate a significant barrier to the identification and management of COVID-19 cases, which requires enhanced non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate this pandemic.","Xu, Xiao-Ke; Liu, Xiao-Fan; Wu, Ye; Ali, Sheikh Taslim; Du, Zhanwei; Bosetti, Paolo; Lau, Eric H Y; Cowling, Benjamin J; Wang, Lin",Clin. infect. dis,,130

Face masks such as N95, and surgical masks, contain a considerable portion of non-recyclable plastic material. Marine plastic pollution is likely to increase due to the rapid use and improper dispensing of face masks, but until now, no extensive quantitative estimation exists for coastal regions. Linking behaviour dataset on face mask usage and solid waste management dataset, this study estimates annual face mask utilization and plastic pollution from mismanaged face masks in coastal regions of 46 countries. It is estimated that approximately 0.15 million tons to 0.39 million tons of plastic debris could end up in global oceans within a year. With lower waste management facilities, the number of plastic debris entering the ocean will rise.

Our study enriches scholarly understanding of this mass response by investigating both generic and pandemic-specific anxiety that explain preventive health behavior. METHODS: In our two-phase, mixed-methods study, pandemic-specific anxiety items elicited during the qualitative phase from March 2-8, 2020 were then tested in the quantitative phase from March 16-22, 2020. Eligible participants were U.S. or U.K. residents aged 18-65. RESULTS: Of the 1,400 participants, 52% met the criteria for moderate to severe anxiety. In addition to anxiety over possible personal COVID-19 infection, participants were also anxious about others' health, others' reactions (e.g., panic-buying, discrimination), societal problems (e.g., economic slowdown, healthcare system breakdown), and personal finances. The positive association between generic anxiety and hygiene practice frequency was explained by two interpersonal-oriented forms of pandemic-specific anxiety: anxiety over others' health (b = 0â¢0040, 95% CI: 0â¢0031-0â¢0050) and others' reactions (0â¢0031, 0â¢0021-0â¢0042). LIMITATIONS: The study was conducted with participants from developed countries at an early stage of the pandemic, and the results were not necessarily generalizable to developing countries or other stages of the pandemic. Also, hygiene practices was the sole behavior of interest, and the findings may differ for other behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The new findings indicate the importance of adopting a nuanced approach that unveils the multifaceted nature of anxiety using a mixed-methods design. Individuals from COVID-19-affected regions experience pandemic-specific anxiety due to concerns related to not only personal but also interpersonal-oriented issues.","Cheng, Cecilia; Wang, Hsin-Yi; Chan, Linus",J Affect Disord,,130

513090,Exploring student mental health and intention to use online counseling in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Objectives: The pandemic spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is due, in part, to the immunological properties of the host-virus interaction. The clinical presentation varies from individual to individual, with asymptomatic carriers, mild-to-moderate-presenting patients and severely affected patients. Variation in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may underlie this clinical variation. Methods: Using a high-dimensional systems immunology platform, we have analysed the peripheral blood compartment of 6 healthy individuals, 23 mild-to-moderate and 20 severe COVID-19 patients. Results: We identify distinct immunological signatures in the peripheral blood of the mild-to-moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, including T-cell lymphopenia, more consistent with peripheral hypo- than hyper-immune activation. Unique to the severe COVID-19 cases was a large increase in the proportion of IL-10-secreting regulatory T cells, a lineage known to possess anti-inflammatory properties in the lung. Conclusion: As IL-10-secreting regulatory T cells are known to possess anti-inflammatory properties in the lung, their proportional increase could contribute to a more severe COVID-19 phenotype.

The most common symptoms were fever (84.1%) and cough (56.8%). The baseline CT was obtained on average 5 days from symptom onset. Four patients (4.5%) had negative initial CT. Significant differences were found among the time intervals in the proportion of pulmonary lesions that are (1) pure GGO, (2) mixed attenuation, (3) mixed attenuation with linear opacities, (4) consolidation with linear opacities, and (5) pure consolidation. The majority of patients had involvement of &#8805; 3 lobes. Bilateral involvement was more prevalent than unilateral involvement. The proportions of patients observed to have pure GGO or GGO and consolidation decreased over time while the proportion of patients with GGO and linear opacities increased. Total severity score showed an increasing trend in the first 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: While bilateral GGO are predominant features, CT findings changed during different time intervals in the 3 weeks after symptom onset in patients with COVID-19. KEY POINTS: â¢ Four of 88 (4.5%) patients with COVID-19 had negative initial CT. â¢ Majority of COVID-19 patients had abnormal CT findings in &#8805; 3 lobes. â¢ A proportion of patients with pure ground glass opacities decreased over the 3 weeks after symptom onset.","Liang, Ting; Liu, Zhe; Wu, Carol C; Jin, Chao; Zhao, Huifang; Wang, Yan; Wang, Zekun; Li, Fen; Zhou, Jie; Cai, Shubo; Liang, Yukun; Zhou, Heping; Wang, Xibin; Ren, Zhuanqin; Yang, Jian",Eur Radiol,,130
518865,"The COVID-19 pandemic: Public knowledge, attitudes and practices in a central of Iran",2021,"BACKGROUND: The Milan metropolitan area in Northern Italy was among the most severely hit by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The aim of this study was to examine the seroprevalence trends of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy asymptomatic adults, and the risk factors and laboratory correlates of positive tests. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a random sample of blood donors, who were asymptomatic at the time of evaluation, at the beginning of the first phase (February 24th to April 8th 2020; n=789). Presence of IgM/IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-Nucleocapsid protein was assessed by a lateral flow immunoassay. RESULTS: The test had a 100/98.3 sensitivity/specificity (n=32/120 positive/negative controls, respectively), and the IgG test was validated in a subset by an independent ELISA against the Spike protein (n=34, p<0.001). At the start of the outbreak, the overall adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.7% (95% CI: 0.3-6%; p<0.0001 vs 120 historical controls). During the study period, characterised by a gradual implementation of social distancing measures, there was a progressive increase in the adjusted seroprevalence to 5.2% (95% CI: 2.4-9.0; 4.5%, 95% CI: 0.9-9.2% according to a Bayesian estimate) due to a rise in IgG reactivity to 5% (95% CI: 2.8-8.2; p=0.004 for trend), but there was no increase in IgM+ (p=not significant). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, IgG reactivity was more frequent in younger individuals (p=0.043), while IgM reactivity was more frequent in individuals aged >45 years (p=0.002). DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection was already circulating in Milan at the start of the outbreak. The pattern of IgM/IgG reactivity was influenced by age: IgM was more frequently detected in participants aged >45 years. By the end of April, 2.4-9.0% of healthy adults had evidence of seroconversion.","Valenti, Luca; Bergna, Annalisa; Pelusi, Serena; Facciotti, Federica; Lai, Alessia; Tarkowski, Maciej; Lombardi, Angela; Berzuini, Alessandra; Caprioli, Flavio; Santoro, Luigi; Baselli, Guido; Ventura, Carla Della; Erba, Elisa; Bosari, Silvano; Galli, Massimo; Zehender, Gianguglielmo; Prati, Daniele","Blood transfus.

METHODS: In an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned adult participants in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S (5×1010 viral particles) or placebo. The primary end points were vaccine efficacy against moderate to severe-critical coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) with an onset at least 14 days and at least 28 days after administration among participants in the per-protocol population who had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: The per-protocol population included 19,630 SARS-CoV-2-negative participants who received Ad26.COV2.S and 19,691 who received placebo. Ad26.COV2.S protected against moderate to severe-critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days after administration (116 cases in the vaccine group vs. 348 in the placebo group; efficacy, 66.9%; adjusted 95% confidence interval [CI], 59.0 to 73.4) and at least 28 days after administration (66 vs. 193 cases; efficacy, 66.1%; adjusted 95% CI, 55.0 to 74.8). Vaccine efficacy was higher against severe-critical Covid-19 (76.7% [adjusted 95% CI, 54.6 to 89.1] for onset at &#8805;14 days and 85.4% [adjusted 95% CI, 54.2 to 96.9] for onset at &#8805;28 days). Despite 86 of 91 cases (94.5%) in South Africa with sequenced virus having the 20H/501Y.V2 variant, vaccine efficacy was 52.0% and 64.0% against moderate to severe-critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days and at least 28 days after administration, respectively, and efficacy against severe-critical Covid-19 was 73.1% and 81.7%, respectively. Reactogenicity was higher with Ad26.COV2.S than with placebo but was generally mild to moderate and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the two groups. Three deaths occurred in the vaccine group (none were Covid-19-related), and 16 in the placebo group (5 were Covid-19-related). CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S protected against symptomatic Covid-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and was effective against severe-critical disease, including hospitalization and death. Safety appeared to be similar to that in other phase 3 trials of Covid-19 vaccines.

520223,Psychometric Evaluation of the Arabic Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale,2020,"Background: Mortality of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and systemic inflammation is high. In areas of pandemic outbreak, the number of patients can exceed maximum capacity of intensive care units (ICUs), and, thus, these individuals often receive non-invasive ventilation outside of the ICU. Effective treatments for this population are needed urgently. Anakinra is a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist that might be beneficial in this patient population. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy. We included consecutive patients (aged &#8805;18 years) with COVID-19, moderate-to-severe ARDS, and hyperinflammation (defined as serum C-reactive protein &#8805;100 mg/L, ferritin &#8805;900 ng/mL, or both) who were managed with non-invasive ventilation outside of the ICU and who received standard treatment of 200 mg hydroxychloroquine twice a day orally and 400 mg lopinavir with 100 mg ritonavir twice a day orally. We compared survival, mechanical ventilation-free survival, changes in C-reactive protein, respiratory function, and clinical status in a cohort of patients who received additional treatment with anakinra (either 5 mg/kg twice a day intravenously [high dose] or 100 mg twice a day subcutaneously [low dose]) with a retrospective cohort of patients who did not receive anakinra (referred to as the standard treatment group). All outcomes were assessed at 21 days. This study is part of the COVID-19 Biobank study, which is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04318366. Findings: Between March 17 and March 27, 2020, 29 patients received high-dose intravenous anakinra, non-invasive ventilation, and standard treatment. Between March 10 and March 17, 2020, 16 patients received non-invasive ventilation and standard treatment only and comprised the comparison group for this study. A further seven patients received low-dose subcutaneous anakinra in addition to non-invasive ventilation and standard treatment; however, anakinra treatment was interrupted after 7 days because of a paucity of effects on serum C-reactive protein and clinical status. At 21 days, treatment with high-dose anakinra was associated with reductions in serum C-reactive protein and progressive improvements in respiratory function in 21 (72%) of 29 patients; five (17%) patients were on mechanical ventilation and three (10%) died. In the standard treatment group, eight (50%) of 16 patients showed respiratory improvement at 21 days; one (6%) patient was on mechanical ventilation and seven (44%) died. At 21 days, survival was 90% in the high-dose anakinra group and 56% in the standard treatment group (p=0·009). Mechanical ventilation-free survival was 72% in the anakinra group versus 50% in the standard treatment group (p=0·15). Bacteraemia occurred in four (14%) of 29 patients receiving high-dose anakinra and two (13%) of 16 patients receiving standard treatment. Discontinuation of anakinra was not followed by inflammatory relapses. Interpretation: In this retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 and ARDS managed with non-invasive ventilation outside of the ICU, treatment with high-dose anakinra was safe and associated with clinical improvement in 72% of patients. Confirmation of efficacy will require controlled trials.

There have been classic clinical cases that have met the case definition of COVID-19 but real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests of nasopharyngeal swabs were negative. Objectives: This study aimed to share pathological observations of autopsies performed at the 37 Military Hospital's Department of Anatomical Pathology on three presumed COVID-19 cases in Accra, Ghana. Method: Complete autopsies with detailed gross and histopathological analysis were conducted between April 2020 and May 2020 on three suspected COVID-19 cases, of which two had initial negative (rRT-PCR) nasopharyngeal tests. Postmortem bronchopulmonary samples of two cases were collected and tested by rRT-PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Results: The two postmortem bronchopulmonary samples tested for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR were positive. Though no postmortem bronchopulmonary sample was taken from the third case, a close contact tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in later contact tracing. For all three cases, lung histopathological findings were consistent with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Conclusion: The outcome of COVID-19 testing is dependent on the sample type and accuracy of sampling amongst other factors. Histopathological findings vary and may be dependent on a patient's modifying factors, as well as the duration of infection. More autopsies are required to fully understand the pathogenesis of this disease in Ghanaians.","Attoh, Seth A; Hobenu, Frederick; Edusei, Lawrence; Agyeman-Bediako, Kwasi; Laryea, Clement T; Nyarko, Edward O; Amedi, Michael K; Asmah, Richard H; Asumanu, Edward; McAddy, Mary; Maison, Anthony; Nyarko, Godwin; Fatchu, Raymond D; Akakpo, Kafui",Afr J Lab Med,,130

Impact of COVID-19 on mental health in a majority Black American sample of schoolchildren,2021-08-14,"BACKGROUND: Since universal vaccinations represents the most effective strategy to mitigate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), baseline assessment and post-vaccine monitoring of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies are essential to vaccination programs. Therefore, this study aimed to compare data of five commercial anti-SARS-CoV2 immunoassays after administration of an mRNA vaccine. METHODS: Venous blood was collected from three healthcare workers, receiving a double (30 g) dose of BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine (Comirnaty, Pfizer), on the day of the first vaccine dose and then at fixed intervals for the following 2 months. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response was assayed with Roche Total Ig anti-RBD (receptor binding domain), DiaSorin TrimericS IgG (spike trimer), Beckman Coulter IgG anti-RBD, SNIBE IgG anti-RBD and Technogenetics IgG anti-N/S1. RESULTS: A total number of 45 samples were drawn at the end of the 2-month study period. The Spearman's correlations of absolute anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were always excellent (all p<0.001), comprised between 0.967-0.994. Satisfactory results were also observed when absolute antiSARS-CoV-2 antibodies values of the five methods were compared with the mean consensus value, with correlations always higher than 0.979 (all p<0.001). The agreement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies positivity versus the consensus median positivity ranged between 0.764 and 1.000 (always p<0.001), but become always >0.900 after readjustment of one assay cutoff. CONCLUSIONS: All the immunoassays evaluated in this study appear suitable for monitoring anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies response in subjects undergoing mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.","Danese, Elisa; Montagnana, Martina; Salvagno, Gian Luca; Gelati, Matteo; Peserico, Denise; Pighi, Laura; de Nitto, Simone; Henry, Brandon M.; Porru, Stefano; Lippi, Giuseppe",J Med Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34616223/; https://doi.org/10.5937/jomb0-31475,130

A 3-wave prospective study.",2021-03-02,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has become a serious challenge for medicine and science. Analysis of the molecular mechanisms associated with the clinical manifestations and severity of COVID-19 has identified several key points of immune dysregulation observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection. For diabetic patients, factors including higher binding affinity and virus penetration, decreased virus clearance and decreased T cell function, increased susceptibility to hyperinflammation, and cytokine storm may make these patients susceptible to a more severe course of COVID-19 disease. Metabolic changes induced by diabetes, especially hyperglycemia, can directly affect the immunometabolism of lymphocytes in part by affecting the activity of the mTOR protein kinase signaling pathway. High mTOR activity can enhance the progression of diabetes due to the activation of effector proinflammatory subpopulations of lymphocytes and, conversely, low activity promotes the differentiation of T-regulatory cells. Interestingly, metformin, an extensively used antidiabetic drug, inhibits mTOR by affecting the activity of AMPK. Therefore, activation of AMPK and/or inhibition of the mTOR-mediated signaling pathway may be an important new target for drug therapy in COVID-19 cases mostly by reducing the level of pro-inflammatory signaling and cytokine storm. These suggestions have been partially confirmed by several retrospective analyzes of patients with diabetes mellitus hospitalized for severe COVID-19.","Kamyshnyi, Olexandr; Matskevych, Victoriya; Lenchuk, Tetyana; Strilbytska, Olha; Storey, Kenneth; Lushchak, Oleh",Biomed Pharmacother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34628168/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221010143?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332221010143; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112230,130

The vaccine was found to be safe and efficacious in one population of cats that had low antibody titre against feline coronavirus (FCoV) at the time of vaccination. Although clinically healthy at the time of vaccination, retrospectively some vaccinees that later came down with FIP were found to be RT-PCR positive for FCoV in plasma and showed changes in blood parameters consistent with early stage of FIP. It is concluded that vaccination can protect cats with no or low FCoV antibody titres and that in some cats vaccine failure was probably due to pre-existing infection.","Fehr, Daniela; Holznagel, Edgar; Bolla, Stefania; Hauser, Beat; Herrewegh, Arnold A.P.M.; Horzinek, Marian C.; Lutz, Hans",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9269053/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X97000066; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X97000066,130

Here, we discuss bat predation by cats as a phenomenon bringing about zoonotic risks and illustrate cases of observed, suspected or hypothesized pathogen transmission from bats to cats, certainly or likely following predation episodes. In addition to well-known cases of bat rabies, we review other diseases that affect humans and might eventually reach them through cats that prey on bats. We also examine the potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, from domestic cats to bats, which, although unlikely, might generate a novel wildlife reservoir in these mammals, and identify research and management directions to achieve more effective risk assessment, mitigation or prevention. Overall, not only does bat killing by cats represent a potentially serious threat to biodiversity conservation, but it also bears zoonotic implications that can no longer be neglected.","Salinas-Ramos, Valeria B.; Mori, Emiliano; Bosso, Luciano; Ancillotto, Leonardo; Russo, Danilo",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10030304; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33807760/,130
591818,Death and dying during COVID-19: The role of health care workers,2021-08-06,"BACKGROUND: The number of deaths from COVID-19 continues to surge worldwide. In particular, if a patient’s condition is sufficiently severe to require invasive ventilation, it is more likely to lead to death than to recovery. OBJECTIVE: The goal of our study was to analyze the factors related to COVID-19 severity in patients and to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict the severity of COVID-19 at an early stage. METHODS: We developed an AI model that predicts severity based on data from 5601 COVID-19 patients from all national and regional hospitals across South Korea as of April 2020. The clinical severity of COVID-19 was divided into two categories: low and high severity. The condition of patients in the low-severity group corresponded to no limit of activity, oxygen support with nasal prong or facial mask, and noninvasive ventilation. The condition of patients in the high-severity group corresponded to invasive ventilation, multi-organ failure with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation required, and death. For the AI model input, we used 37 variables from the medical records, including basic patient information, a physical index, initial examination findings, clinical findings, comorbid diseases, and general blood test results at an early stage. Feature importance analysis was performed with AdaBoost, random forest, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost); the AI model for predicting COVID-19 severity among patients was developed with a 5-layer deep neural network (DNN) with the 20 most important features, which were selected based on ranked feature importance analysis of 37 features from the comprehensive data set. The selection procedure was performed using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, balanced accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: We found that age was the most important factor for predicting disease severity, followed by lymphocyte level, platelet count, and shortness of breath or dyspnea. Our proposed 5-layer DNN with the 20 most important features provided high sensitivity (90.2%), specificity (90.4%), accuracy (90.4%), balanced accuracy (90.3%), and AUC (0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed AI model with the selected features was able to predict the severity of COVID-19 accurately. We also made a web application so that anyone can access the model. We believe that sharing the AI model with the public will be helpful in validating and improving its performance.","Chung, Heewon; Ko, Hoon; Kang, Wu Seong; Kim, Kyung Won; Lee, Hooseok; Park, Chul; Song, Hyun-Ok; Choi, Tae-Young; Seo, Jae Ho; Lee, Jinseok",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/27060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33764883/,130
592141,Online Mental Health Services in Indonesia During the COVID-19 Outbreak,2020-05-05,"Background: Residents of correctional facilities have experienced disproportionately higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19-related mortality. To protect against outbreaks, many prisons and jails imposed heavy restrictions on in-person activities, which are now beginning to lift. Uncertainty surrounds the safety of these moves. Methods and Findings: We obtained system-wide resident-day level data for the California state prison system, the nation's third largest. We used the data to develop a transmission-dynamic stochastic microsimulation model that projects the impact of various policy scenarios on risks of SARS-CoV-2 infections and related hospitalization among residents after an initial infection is introduced to a prison. The policy scenarios vary according to levels of vaccine coverage, baseline immunity, resumption of activities, and use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., masking, physical distancing). The analyses were conducted across 5 types of prisons that differed in their residential layouts, security levels, and resident demographics. If a viral variant is introduced into a prison that has resumed pre-2020 contact levels, has moderate vaccine coverage, and has no baseline immunity, 23-74% of residents are expected to be infected over 200 days. High vaccination coverage coupled with use of non-pharmaceutical measures reduces cumulative infections to 2-54% of residents. In prisons consisting mostly of dormitory housing, even with high vaccine coverage and non-pharmaceutical interventions, resumption of in-person activities is associated with substantial risk, unless there is high baseline immunity (e.g., [≥]50%) from prior outbreaks. In prisons consisting mostly of cell housing, <10% of residents are expected to become infected, even with no baseline immunity. However, hospitalization risks are substantial in prisons that house medically vulnerable populations, even for prisons consisting mostly of cells. Risks of large outbreaks are substantially higher if there is continued introduction of infections into a prison. Some findings may not be transportable to other carceral settings, and our assumptions regarding viral variants will not be accurate for all variants. Conclusions: Balancing the benefits of resuming normal in-person activities against the risks of Covid-19 outbreaks is a difficult challenge for correctional systems. The policy choices are not strictly binary. To protect against viral variants, prisons should focus on achieving both high vaccine coverage and maintaining widespread use of non-pharmaceutical interventions. With both in place, some prisons, especially those with lower room occupancy that have already had large outbreaks, could safely resume in-person activities, while continuing testing and measures to protect the medically-vulnerable.","Ryckman, T.

Unfortunately, newly emerged, fast-spreading strains of COVID-19 threaten to undermine progress by interfering with vaccine efficacy. While a long-term solution to this challenge would be to develop vaccines that simultaneously target multiple different COVID-19 variants, this approach faces both developmental and regulatory hurdles. A simpler option would be to switch the target of the current vaccine to better match the newest viral variant. I use a stochastic simulation to determine when it is better to target a newly emerged viral variant and when it is better to target the dominant but potentially less transmissible strain. My simulation results suggest that it is almost always better to target the faster spreading strain, even when the initial prevalence of this variant is much lower. In scenarios where targeting the slower spreading variant is best, all vaccination strategies perform relatively well, meaning that the choice of vaccination strategy has a small effect on public health outcomes. In scenarios where targeting the faster spreading variant is best, use of vaccines against the faster spreading viral variant can save many lives. My results provide rule of thumb guidance for those making critical decisions about vaccine formulation over the coming months.","Bewick, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249255v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.05.21249255,130

Yet, a consistent feature of these public health crises is the surge in the demand for healthcare services exceeds the availability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted in the month of June and July 2020 in Karachi, Pakistan. The study participants included doctors and medical students residing in Karachi. RESULTS: Out of 187 doctors, 74.3% were working during the COVID-19 pandemic, of which 58.3% were willing to work. Out of 200 medical students, 93.5% were not volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic, of which 46% were willing to volunteer. Doctors strongly agreed that they would be willing to work during the COVID-19 pandemic if they were healthy and able to do so (57.2%), if they were provided personal protective equipment (PPE) (51.3%), and if they were guaranteed coverage of treatment cost if they get infected while working (57.8%). Medical students strongly agreed that they would be willing to volunteer during the COVID-19 pandemic if they were provided PPE (49.0%), and if their parents were supportive of their decision to volunteer (44.5%). Most doctors (54.5%) felt that they were extremely likely to get infected while working during the COVID-19 pandemic and 59.4% felt that in turn, they were extremely likely to infect their families as well. Most medical students (40.5%) felt that they were somewhat likely to get infected while volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic and 55.5% felt that in turn, they were extremely likely to infect their family as well. In the event of infection with COVID-19, 51.3% doctors and 42.0% medical students felt that they would recover without hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Since future pandemics are likely, we encourage health-care policymakers to utilize the findings of this study to create a sustainable pandemic response.","Khalid, Momina; Khalid, Hiba; Bhimani, Sameer; Bhimani, Simran; Khan, Sheharyar; Choudry, Erum; Mahmood, Syed Uzair",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s310453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34408512/,130
595804,Rethinking online mental health services in China during the COVID-19 epidemic,2020-03-23,"BACKGROUND: The epidermis forms a critical barrier that is maintained by orchestrated programs of proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. Gene mutations that disturb this turnover process may cause skin diseases. Human GASDERMIN A (GSDMA) is frequently silenced in gastric cancer cell lines and its overexpression has been reported to induce apoptosis. GSDMA has also been linked with airway hyperresponsiveness in genetic association studies. The function of GSDMA in the skin was deduced by dominant mutations in mouse gasdermin A3 (Gsdma3), which caused skin inflammation and hair loss. However, the mechanism for the autosomal dominance of Gsdma3 mutations and the mode of Gsdma3’s action remain unanswered. RESULTS: We demonstrated a novel function of Gsdma3 in modulating mitochondrial oxidative stress. We showed that Gsdma3 is regulated by intramolecular fold-back inhibition, which is disrupted by dominant mutations in the C-terminal domain. The unmasked N-terminal domain of Gsdma3 associates with Hsp90 and is delivered to mitochondrial via mitochondrial importer receptor Tom70, where it interacts with the mitochondrial chaperone Trap1 and causes increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Overexpression of the C-terminal domain of Gsdma3 as well as pharmacological interventions of mitochondrial translocation, ROS production, and MPT pore opening alleviate the cell death induced by Gsdma3 mutants. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the genetic mutations in the C-terminal domain of Gsdma3 are gain-of-function mutations which unmask the N-terminal functional domain of Gsdma3. Gsdma3 regulates mitochondrial oxidative stress through mitochondrial targeting. Since mitochondrial ROS has been shown to promote epidermal differentiation, we hypothesize that Gsdma3 regulates context-dependent response of keratinocytes to differentiation and cell death signals by impinging on mitochondria.

To understand this better, an 18-item online survey was disseminated by the Worldwide Network for Blood & Marrow Transplantation with questions exploring SARS-CoV-2 testing algorithms, mobilization, and cryopreservation strategies and COVID-19 infections in allogeneic related and autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) donors. The aim of this survey was to assess the impact of the outbreak on policies relating to HPC mobilization, collection, and processing with respect to changes in daily routine. A total of 91 individual responses from distinct centers in 6 continents were available for analysis. In these centers, the majority (72%) of allogeneic related and autologous donors are routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 before HPC collection, and 80% of centers implement cryopreservation of allogeneic HPC grafts before commencing conditioning regimens in patients. Five related and 14 autologous donors who tested positive for COVID-19 did not experience any unexpected adverse events or reactions during growth factor administration (eg, hyperinflammatory syndrome). These data are limited by the small number of survey respondents but nonetheless suggest that centers are following the recommendations of appropriate scientific organizations and provide some preliminary data to suggest areas of further study.","Worel, Nina; Shaw, Bronwen E.; Aljurf, Mahmoud; Koh, Mickey; Seber, Adriana; Weisdorf, Daniel; Schwartz, Joseph; Galeano, Sebastian; Kodera, Yoshihisa; Eldridge, Paul W.; Hashmi, Shahrukh; Atsuta, Yoshiko; Szer, Jeff; Saber, Wael; Niederwieser, Dietger; Greinix, Hildegard T.",Transplant Cell Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781537/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtct.2020.11.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666636720300440; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666636720300440,130

597081,Employment Uncertainty and Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic Initial Social Distancing Implementation: a Cross-national Study,2021-01-07,"Neandertals were an anatomically distinct hominoid species inhabiting a vast geographical area ranging from Portugal to western Siberia and from northern Europe to the Middle East. The species became extinct 28,000 years ago, coinciding with the arrival of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) in Europe 40,000 years ago. There has been considerable debate surrounding the main causes of the extinction of Neandertals. After at least 200,000 years of successful adaption to the climate, flora and fauna of Eurasia, it is not clear why they suddenly failed to survive. For many years, climate change or competition with anatomically modern human (AMH) have been the leading hypotheses. Recently these hypotheses have somewhat fallen out of favour due to the recognition that Neandertals were a highly developed species with complex social structure, culture and technical skills. Were AMHs lucky and survived some catastrophe that eradicated the Neandertals? It seems unlikely that this is the case considering the close timing of the arrival of AMHs and the disappearance of Neandertals. Perhaps the arrival of AMHs also brought additional new non-human microscopic inhabitants to the regions where Neandertals lived and these new inhabitants contributed to the disappearance of the species. We introduce a medical hypothesis that complements other recent explanations for the extinction of Neandertals. After the ancestors of Neandertals left Africa, their immune system adapted gradually to the pathogens in their new Eurasian environment. In contrast, AMHs continued to co-evolve with east African pathogens. More than 200,000 years later, AMHs carried pathogens that would have been alien to pre-historic Europe. First contact between long separated populations can be devastating. Recent European and American history provides evidence for similar events, where introduction of viral, protozoan or bacterial pathogens to immunologically naïve populations lead to mass mortality and local population extinction. We propose that a virus, possibly from the family Herpesviridae, contributed to Neandertal extinction.","Wolff, Horst; Greenwood, Alex D.",Med Hypotheses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987710000642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20172660/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987710000642; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2010.01.048,130

As the pandemic lasts, burnout among the nursing staff needs to be considered as an important challenge. This was aimed to assess the nurses’ burnout and factors affecting this variable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, Maslach Burnout Inventory was completed by 261 nurses in Shiraz hospitals (Iran) in April 2020. This questionnaire addresses different aspects, including emotional exhaustion, personal achievement, and depersonalization, to determine the intensity of perceived burnout among nurses during the outbreak. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that the nurses’ burnout in Shiraz hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic was high (64.6%). Emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were observed in 63.6 and 53.3 percent of the participants, respectively. Moreover, the rate of successful personal achievement among these nurses was >97%. Work experience <10 years (P=0.016), hospital ward (P=0.044), the number of deaths observed by nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic (P<0.001), and the total number of shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic (P=0.006) had a positive correlation with emotional exhaustion.

It is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and affects both galliform and nongalliform birds. Its economic impact includes decreased egg production and poor egg quality in layers, stunted growth, poor carcass weight, and mortality in broiler chickens. Although primarily affecting the respiratory tract, IBV demonstrates a wide range of tissues tropism, including the renal and reproductive systems. Thus, disease outcome may be influenced by the organ or tissue involved as well as pathotypes or strain of the infecting virus. Knowledge on the epidemiology of the prevalent IBV strains in a particular region is therefore important to guide control and preventions. Meanwhile previous diagnostic methods such as serology and virus isolations are less sensitive and time consuming, respectively; current methods, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), and sequencing, offer highly sensitive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic results, thus enabling the genotyping of new viral strains within the shortest possible time.

The guanine-rich U3 region within the LTR promoter, previously shown to form G-quadruplex structures, represents an attractive target to inhibit HIV transcription and replication. In this work, we report the structure of a biologically relevant G-quadruplex within the LTR promoter region of HIV-1. The guanine-rich sequence designated LTR-IV forms a well-defined structure in physiological cationic solution. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of this sequence reveals a parallel-stranded G-quadruplex containing a single-nucleotide thymine bulge, which participates in a conserved stacking interaction with a neighboring single-nucleotide adenine loop. Transcription analysis in a HIV-1 replication competent cell indicates that the LTR-IV region may act as a modulator of G-quadruplex formation in the LTR promoter. Consequently, the LTR-IV G-quadruplex structure presented within this work could represent a valuable target for the design of HIV therapeutics.","De Nicola, Beatrice; Lech, Christopher J.; Heddi, Brahim; Regmi, Sagar; Frasson, Ilaria; Perrone, Rosalba; Richter, Sara N.; Phan, Anh Tuân",Nucleic Acids Res,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27298260/,130

602156,The Bidirectional Relationship Between Debts and Common Mental Disorders: Results of a longitudinal Population-Based Study,2021-04-13,"BACKGROUND: The rapid global spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2 has provoked a spike in demand for hospital care. Hospital systems across the world have been over-extended, including in Northern Italy, Ecuador, and New York City, and many other systems face similar challenges. As a result, decisions on how to best allocate very limited medical resources have come to the forefront. Specifically, under consideration are decisions on who to test, who to admit into hospitals, who to treat in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and who to support with a ventilator. Given today’s ability to gather, share, analyze and process data, personalized predictive models based on demographics and information regarding prior conditions can be used to (1) help decision-makers allocate limited resources, when needed, (2) advise individuals how to better protect themselves given their risk profile, (3) differentiate social distancing guidelines based on risk, and (4) prioritize vaccinations once a vaccine becomes available. OBJECTIVE: To develop personalized models that predict the following events: (1) hospitalization, (2) mortality, (3) need for ICU, and (4) need for a ventilator. To predict hospitalization, it is assumed that one has access to a patient’s basic preconditions, which can be easily gathered without the need to be at a hospital. For the remaining models, different versions developed include different sets of a patient’s features, with some including information on how the disease is progressing (e.g., diagnosis of pneumonia). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from a publicly available repository, updated daily, containing information from approximately 91,000 patients in Mexico were used. The data for each patient include demographics, prior medical conditions, SARS-CoV-2 test results, hospitalization, mortality and whether a patient has developed pneumonia or not. Several classification methods were applied, including robust versions of logistic regression, and support vector machines, as well as random forests and gradient boosted decision trees. RESULTS: Interpretable methods (logistic regression and support vector machines) perform just as well as more complex models in terms of accuracy and detection rates, with the additional benefit of elucidating variables on which the predictions are based. Classification accuracies reached 61%, 76%, 83%, and 84% for predicting hospitalization, mortality, need for ICU and need for a ventilator, respectively. The analysis reveals the most important preconditions for making the predictions. For the four models derived, these are: (1) for hospitalization: age, gender, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes, immunosuppression; (2) for mortality: age, SARS-CoV-2 test status, immunosuppression and pregnancy; (3) for ICU need: development of pneumonia (if available), cardiovascular disease, asthma, and SARS-CoV-2 test status; and (4) for ventilator need: ICU and pneumonia (if available), age, gender, cardiovascular disease, obesity, pregnancy, and SARS-CoV-2 test result.","Wollenstein-Betech, Salomón; Cassandras, Christos G.; Paschalidis, Ioannis Ch.",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511489/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.03.20089813v1?rss=1,130

We observed more polarization with greater ability in emotional responses, risk perceptions, and product-purchase intentions across five waves of data collection with a diverse, convenience sample from February 2020 through July 2020 (Study 1, N = 1267). Specifically, more liberal participants had more negative emotional responses and greater risk perceptions of COVID-19 than conservative participants. Compared to conservatives, liberal participants also interpreted quantitative information as indicating higher COVID-19 risk and sought COVID-related news more from liberal than conservative news media. Of key importance, we also compared verbal and numeric cognitive abilities for their independent capacity to predict greater polarization. Although measures of numeric ability, such as objective numeracy, are often used to index ability-related polarization, ideological differences were more pronounced among those higher in verbal ability specifically. Similar results emerged in secondary analysis of risk perceptions in a nationally representative longitudinal dataset (Study 2, N = 4494; emotions and purchase intentions were not included in this dataset). We further confirmed verbal-ability-related polarization findings on non-COVID policy attitudes (i.e., weapons bans and Medicare-for-all) measured cross-sectionally. The present Study 2 documented ability-related polarization emerging over time for the first time (rather than simply measuring polarization in existing beliefs). Both studies demonstrated verbal ability measures as the most robust predictors of ability-related polarization. Together, these results suggest that polarization may be a function of the amount and/or application of verbal knowledge rather than selective application of quantitative reasoning skills.","Shoots-Reinhard, Brittany; Goodwin, Raleigh; Bjälkebring, Pär; Markowitz, David M.; Silverstein, Michael C.; Peters, Ellen",Intelligence,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2021.101580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566199/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289621000647; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160289621000647,130

Methods We retrospectively retrieved data for 152 severe inpatients with COVID-19 including 60 young patients in the Eastern Campus of Wuhan University affiliated Renmin Hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 31, 2020 to February 20, 2020. We recorded and analyzed patients' demographic, clinical, laboratory, and chest CT findings, treatment and outcomes data. Results Of those 60 severe young patients, 15 (25%) were died. Male was more predominant in deceased young patients (12, 80%) than that in recovered young patients (22, 49%). Hypertension was more common among deceased young patients (8, 53%) than that in recovered young patients (7, 16%). Compared with the recovered young patients, more deceased young patients presented with sputum (11, 73%), dyspnea (12, 80%) and fatigue (13, 87%). Only sputum, PSI and neutrophil counts were remained as independent predictors of death in a multivariate logistic regression model. Among ARDS patients, the recovered were administrated with corticosteroid earlier and anticoagulation. The addition of neutrophil counts >6.3×109/L to the SMART-COP score resulted in improved area under the curves. Conclusions Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection in young deceased patients appears to cause exuberant inflammatory responses, leading to compromised oxygen exchange, coagulation and multi-organ dysfunction. In addition, young patients with ARDS could benefit from adjuvant early corticosteroid and anticoagulation therapy. The expanded SMART-COP could predict the fatal outcomes with optimal efficiency.","Liu, Zilong; Liu, Jie; Ye, Ling; Yu, Kaihuan; Luo, Zhe; Liang, Chao; Cao, Jiangtian; Wu, Xu; Li, Shanqun; Zhu, Lei; Xiang, Guiling",Journal of thoracic disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34277055/; https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-21-120,130
603555,AARP study examines MH impact on seniors amid COVID‐19,2021-07-02,"BACKGROUND: The worsening COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa poses multiple challenges for clinical decision making in the context of already-scarce ICU resources. Data from national government and the last published national audit of ICU resources indicate gross shortages. While the Critical Care Society of Southern Africa (CCSSA) guidelines provide a comprehensive guideline for triage in the face of overwhelmed ICU resources, such decisions present massive ethical and moral dilemmas for triage teams. It is therefore important for the health system to provide clinicians and critical care facilities with as much support and resources as possible in the face of impending pandemic demand. Following a discussion of the ethical considerations and potential challenges in applying the CCSSA guidelines, the authors propose a framework for regional triage committees adapted to the South African context. DISCUSSION: Beyond the national CCSSA guidelines, the clinician has many additional ethical and clinical considerations. No single ethical approach to decision-making is sufficient, instead one which considers multiple contextual factors is necessary. Scores such as the Clinical Frailty Score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment are of limited use in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, the clinician is fully justified in withdrawing ICU care based on medical futility decisions and to reallocate this resource to a patient with a better prognosis. However, these decisions bear heavy emotional and moral burden compounded by the volume of clinical work and a fear of litigation. CONCLUSION: We propose the formation of Provincial multi-disciplinary Critical Care Triage Committees to alleviate the emotional, moral and legal burden on individual ICU teams and co-ordinate inter-facility collaboration using an adapted framework. The committee would provide an impartial, broader and ethically-sound viewpoint which has time to consider broader contextual factors such as adjusting rationing criteria according to different levels of pandemic demand and the latest clinical evidence. Their functioning will be strengthened by direct feedback to national level and accountability to a national monitoring committee. The potential applications of these committees are far-reaching and have the potential to enable a more effective COVID-19 health systems response in South Africa.","Naidoo, Reshania; Naidoo, Kantharuben",BMC Med Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33752662/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-021-00596-5,130

METHODS: The number of hospitalizations for self-harm (ICD-10 codes X60-X84) in France from 1st January to 31st August 2020 (including a two-month confinement) was compared to the same periods in 2017–2019. Statistical methods comprised Poisson regression, Cox regression and Student's t-test, plus Spearman's correlation test relating to spatial analysis of hospitalizations. OUTCOMES: There were 53,583 self-harm hospitalizations in France during January to August 2020. Compared to the same period in 2019, this represents an overall 8·5% decrease (Relative Risk [95% Confidence Interval] = 0·91 [0·90–0·93]).This decrease started in the first week of confinement and persisted until the end of August. Similarly, decrease was found in both women (RR=0·90 [0·88–0·92]) and men (RR=0·94 [0·91–0·95]), and in all age groups, except 65 years and older. Regarding self-harm hospitalizations by means category, increases were found for firearm (RR=1·20 [1·03–1·40]) and for jumping from heights (RR=1·10 [1·01–1·21]). There was a trend for more hospitalizations in intensive care (RR=1·03 [0·99–1·07]). The number of deaths at discharge from hospital also increased (Hazard Ratio = 1·19 [1·09–1·31]). Self-harm hospitalizations were weakly correlated with the rates of hospitalization for COVID-19 across administrative departments (Spearman's rho =-0·21; p = 0·03), but not with overall hospitalizations.

The clinical characteristics of severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 are still not clear. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of severe pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China. METHODS: The study included patients hospitalized at the Central Hospital of Wuhan who were diagnosed with COVID-19. Clinical features, chronic comorbidities, demographic data, laboratory examinations, and chest computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed through electronic medical records. SPSS was used for data analysis to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of patients with severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 110 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study, including 38 with severe pneumonia and 72 with nonsevere pneumonia. Statistical analysis showed that advanced age, increased D-Dimer, and decreased lymphocytes were characteristics of the patients with severe pneumonia. Moreover, in the early stage of the disease, chest CT scans of patients with severe pneumonia showed that the illness can progress rapidly. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age, decreased lymphocytes, and D-Dimer elevation are important characteristics of patients with severe COVID-19. Clinicians should focus on these characteristics to identify high-risk patients at an early stage.","Wang, Yafei; Zhou, Ying; Yang, Zhen; Xia, Dongping; Hu, Yi; Geng, Shuang",Respiration,https://doi.org/10.1159/000507940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32841948/,130

This study aimed to examine (1) how life satisfaction and its potential predictors have been affected by the pandemic among school-aged children in Korea, and (2) which factors would predict their life satisfaction during the pandemic. We surveyed 166 fourth-graders in the Seoul metropolitan area to assess their psychological well-being and potentially related variables during the pandemic. The data were compared with those available from two pre-COVID-19 surveys, the 2018 Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (n = 1236) and the 2019 Korean Children and Youth Well-being Index Survey (n = 334). Higher levels of stress were observed in children during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the level of their life satisfaction remained unchanged when compared with data from the pre-COVID-19 surveys. The pandemic also affected peer relationship quality and susceptibility to smartphone addiction, but not perceived parenting style nor academic engagement. Interestingly, peer relationship quality no longer predicted life satisfaction during the pandemic; perceived parenting styles and parent-child conversation time predicted life satisfaction. The results suggest a central role of parent-child relationship in supporting the psychological well-being of school-aged children during the pandemic.","Choi, Jihye; Park, Youjeong; Kim, Hye-Eun; Song, Jihyeok; Lee, Daeun; Lee, Eunhye; Kang, Hyeonjin; Lee, Jeeho; Park, Jihyeon; Lee, Ji-Woo; Ye, Seongeun; Lee, Seul; Ryu, Sohee; Kim, Yeojeong; Kim, Ye-Ri; Kim, Yu-Jin; Lee, Yuseon",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18063324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33807042/,130

The SARS-CoV unique domain (SUD) with three macrodomains (N, M, and C), showing the G-quadruplex binding activity, was examined the possible role in SARS pathogenesis in this study. The chemokine profile analysis indicated that SARS-CoV SUD significantly up-regulated the expression of CXCL10, CCL5 and interleukin (IL)-1β in human lung epithelial cells and in the lung tissues of the mice intratracheally instilled with the recombinant plasmids. Among the SUD subdomains, SUD-MC substantially activated AP-1-mediated CXCL10 expression in vitro. In the wild type mice, SARS-CoV SUD-MC triggered the pulmonary infiltration of macrophages and monocytes, inducing CXCL10-mediated inflammatory responses and severe diffuse alveolar damage symptoms. Moreover, SUD-MC actuated NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-dependent pulmonary inflammation, as confirmed by the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor and the NLRP3(−/−) mouse model. This study demonstrated that SARS-CoV SUD modulated NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent CXCL10-mediated pulmonary inflammation, providing the potential therapeutic targets for developing the antiviral agents.","Chang, Young-Sheng; Ko, Bo-Han; Ju, Jyh-Cherng; Chang, Hsin-Hou; Huang, Su-Hua; Lin, Cheng-Wen",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21093179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32365944/,130
605536,Effect of COVID-19 on the mental health care of older people in Canada,2020-04-24,"Dengue virus is the most common arboviral infection of humans in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. This review briefly describes some of the challenges it presents. Dengue is an emerging disease; it is increasing in geographical distribution and severity, despite being significantly underreported. The World Health Organization case definition for the generally more severe manifestation of infection, dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), is controversial. The name DHF is something of a misnomer as the disease infrequently results in frank haemorrhage; the hallmark of DHF is actually plasma leakage. The existence of four closely related dengue virus serotypes contributes to difficulties in diagnosis and to original antigenic sin in the serological response to infection. The existence of multiple serotypes can result in more severe disease upon a second infection and complicates vaccine development. Nevertheless, a safe and effective vaccine is the greatest prospect for stemming the tide of dengue.","Gibbons, Robert V.",Int J Antimicrob Agents,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2010.06.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20696556/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857910002608; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857910002608,130

606044,Where Have All the Emergency Pediatric Mental Health Patients Gone During COVID19?,2020-08-16,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 outbreak has been identified as a pandemic and global health emergency. It presents as a severe acute respiratory disease. The rapid dissemination of the disease created challenges for healthcare systems and forced healthcare workers (HCWs) to deal with many clinical and nonclinical stresses. The aim of our research is to describe work conditions, symptoms experienced by HCWs, worries about contagion, and generalized anxiety symptoms and compare those findings across regions in Spain. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey. Critical care units throughout Spain were included. The sample comprised HCWs working in intensive care units from March to May 2020. We assessed work variables, physical symptoms, worries about contagion, and anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder-7 questionnaire). RESULTS: The final sample comprised 448 surveys. Among the respondents, 86.9% (n=389) were nursing professionals, and 84.8% (n=380) were women. All participants cared for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients during the study period. Workload during the pandemic in Madrid was judged to be higher than in other regions (P<0.01). The availability of personal protective equipment was found to be higher in Cataluña. The most frequently experienced symptom was headaches (78.1%). Worries about self-infection and the possibility of infecting others received mean scores of 3.11 and 3.75, respectively. Mean scores for generalized anxiety levels were 11.02, with 58.7% of the professionals presenting with generalized anxiety syndrome during the assessment. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found high levels of anxiety among HCWs caring directly for COVID-19 patients, which could produce long-term psychological alterations that still need to be assessed.","García-Hedrera, Fernando J.; Gil-Almagro, Fernanda; Carmona-Monge, F.

It has also negatively influenced people’s general health and quality of life. The aim of the present study was to study the impact of social distancing on physical activity level, and the association between mood state (depression and anxiety level) or sex with actual physical activity levels, the change in physical activity caused by social distancing period, the adhesion level to social distancing, the adoption time of social distancing, family income and age. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire with personal, quarantine, physical activity, and mood state disorders information’s was answered by 2140 Brazilians of both sex who were recruited through online advertising. RESULTS: The physical activity level adopted during the period of social distancing (3.5 ± 0.8) was lower than that the adopted prior to the pandemic period (2.9 ± 1.1, p < 0.001). Thirty percent of the participants presented symptoms of moderate/severe depression and 23.3% displayed moderate/severe anxiety symptoms. A greater presence of symptoms related to anxiety and depression were associated with low physical activity levels, low family monthly income, and younger age. A higher percentage of men who had no mood disorders was observed among those who were very active than among those less active. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on physical activity. Those who reduced their level of physical activity had the highest levels of mood disorders. Therefore, physical activity programs should be encouraged, while respecting the necessary social distancing to prevent the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2.","Puccinelli, Paulo José; da Costa, Taline Santos; Seffrin, Aldo; de Lira, Claudio Andre Barbosa; Vancini, Rodrigo Luiz; Nikolaidis, Pantelis T.; Knechtle, Beat; Rosemann, Thomas; Hill, Lee; Andrade, Marilia Santos",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33648487/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10470-z,130

A Multi-country Analysis Using Data from 102,627 Individuals",2021-01-26,"Political polarization remains perhaps the “greatest barrier” to effective COVID-19 pandemic mitigation measures in the United States. Social media has been implicated in fueling this polarization. In this paper, we uncover the network of COVID-19 related news sources shared to 30 politically biased and 2 neutral subcommunities on Reddit. We find, using exponential random graph modeling, that news sources associated with highly toxic – “rude, disrespectful” – content are more likely to be shared across political subreddits. We also find homophily according to toxicity levels in the network of online news sources. Our findings suggest that news sources associated with high toxicity are rewarded with prominent positions in the resultant network. The toxicity in COVID-19 discussions may fuel political polarization by denigrating ideological opponents and politicizing responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, all to the detriment of mitigation measures. Public health practitioners should monitor toxicity in public online discussions to familiarize themselves with emerging political arguments that threaten adherence to public health crises management. We also recommend, based on our findings, that social media platforms algorithmically promote neutral and scientific news sources to reduce toxic discussion in subcommunities and encourage compliance with public health recommendations in the fight against COVID-19.","Chipidza, Wallace",Int J Inf Manage,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401221000906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34545262/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0268401221000906; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2021.102397,130
607808,Impacts of Transportation and Meteorological Factors on the Transmission of COVID-19,2020-08-26,"OBJECTIVES: Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus may cause lung failure and the need for mechanical ventilation. Infection with SARS-COV-2 can lead to activation of inflammatory factors, increased reactive oxygen species, and cell damage. In addition to mucolytic effects, N-Acetylcysteine has antioxidant effects that we believe can help patients recover. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of N-Acetylcysteine in patients with severe COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, phase 3 controlled clinical trial with two arms (ratio 1:1) parallel-group design of 40 patients, using the placebo in the control group. PARTICIPANTS: All severe COVID-19 patients with at least one of the following five conditions: (respiration rate > 30 per minute), hypoxemia (O2 ≤ saturation, arterial oxygen partial pressure ratio <300), pulmonary infiltration (> 50% of lung area during 24 48 h), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 245 U / l, Progressive lymphopenia, and admitted to the intensive care unit of Shahid Mohammadi Hospital in Bandar Abbas and have positive PCR test results for SARS-Cov-2 and sign the written consent of the study will be included. Patients will be excluded from the study if they have a history of hypersensitivity to N-Acetylcysteine, pregnancy, or refuse to participate in the study. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: After randomization, participants in the intervention group receive standard of care (SOC) according to the National Committee of COVID-19 plus N-acetylcysteine (EXI-NACE 200mg/mL, in 10mL ampules of saline for parenteral injection (EXIR pharmaceutical company)) at a dose of 300 mg/kg equivalent to 20 gr as a slow single intravenous injection on the first day of hospitalization. In the control group patients receive SOC and placebo ( Sterile water for injection as the same dose). The placebo is identical in appearance to the N-acetylcysteine injection (EXIR pharmaceutical company as well). MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint for this study is a composite endpoint for the length of hospitalization in the intensive care unit and the patient's clinical condition. These outcomes were measured at the baseline (before the intervention) and on the 14th day after the intervention or on the discharge day. RANDOMISATION: Eligible participants (40) will be randomized in two arms in the ratio of 1: 1 (20 per arm) using online web-based tools and by permuted block randomization method. To ensure randomization concealment, random sequence codes are assigned to patients by the treatment team at the time of admission without knowing that each code is in the intervention or comparator group. BLINDING (MASKING): All participants will be informed about participating in the study and the possible side effects of medication and placebo. Patients participating in the study will not be aware of the assignment to the intervention or control group. The principal investigator, health care personnel, data collectors, and those evaluating the outcome are aware of patient grouping. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 40 patients participate in this study, which are randomly divided; 20 patients in the intervention group will receive SOC and N-acetylcysteine, 20 patients in the control group will receive SOC and placebo. TRIAL STATUS: First version of the protocol was approved by the Deputy of Research and Technology and the ethics committee of Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences on February 14, 2021, with the local code 990573, and the recruitment started on March 2, 2021 and the expected recruitment end date is April 1, 2021.

608458,Caring for patients in mental health services during COVID-19 outbreak in China,2020-11-22,"BACKGROUND: Internationally, key workers such as healthcare staff are advised to stay at home if they or household members experience coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)–like symptoms. This potentially isolates/quarantines many staff without SARS-CoV-2, while not preventing transmission from staff with asymptomatic infection. We explored the impact of testing staff on absence durations from work and transmission risks to others. METHODS: We used a decision-analytic model for 1000 key workers to compare the baseline strategy of (S0) no RT-PCR testing of workers to testing workers (S1) with COVID-19–like symptoms in isolation, (S2) without COVID-19–like symptoms but in household quarantine, and (S3) all staff. We explored confirmatory re-testing scenarios of repeating all initial tests, initially positive tests, initially negative tests, or no re-testing. We varied all parameters, including the infection rate (0.1–20%), proportion asymptomatic (10–80%), sensitivity (60–95%), and specificity (90–100%). RESULTS: Testing all staff (S3) changes the risk of workplace transmission by −56.9 to +1.0 workers/1000 tests (with reductions throughout at RT-PCR sensitivity ≥65%), and absences by −0.5 to +3.6 days/test but at heightened testing needs of 989.6–1995.9 tests/1000 workers. Testing workers in household quarantine (S2) reduces absences the most by 3.0–6.9 days/test (at 47.0–210.4 tests/1000 workers), while increasing risk of workplace transmission by 0.02–49.5 infected workers/1000 tests (which can be minimized when re-testing initially negative tests). CONCLUSIONS: Based on optimizing absence durations or transmission risk, our modeling suggests testing staff in household quarantine or all staff, depending on infection levels and testing capacities.","Sandmann, Frank G; White, Peter J; Ramsay, Mary; Jit, Mark",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32634823/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa901,130

Biopsy of the mass revealed small-cell carcinoma of the breast, negative for all 3 receptors (estrogen, progesterone, and Her2/neu). Imaging studies were negative for distant metastasis. She was subsequently treated after multidisciplinary discussion utilizing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with platinum agents and etoposide, modified radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection, and adjuvant radiation therapy. Since she has triple-negative small-cell breast cancer, she will be followed with active surveillance without hormonal therapy.

608647,Adolescents' Perceived Socio-Emotional Impact of COVID-19 and Implications for Mental Health: Results From a U.S.-Based Mixed-Methods Study,2020-11-02,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, schools across the United States began transitioning to virtual learning during spring 2020. However, schools' learning modes varied during the 2020-21 school year across states as schools transitioned at differing times back to in-person learning, in part reflecting updated CDC guidance. Reduced access to in-person learning is associated with poorer learning outcomes and adverse mental health and behavioral effects in children (1-3). Data on the learning modes available in 1,200 U.S. public school districts (representing 46% of kindergarten through grade 12 [K-12] public school enrollment) from all 50 states and the District of Columbia during September 2020-April 2021 were matched with National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) demographic data. Learning mode access was assessed for K-12 students during the COVID-19 pandemic, over time and by student race/ethnicity, geography, and grade level group. Across all assessed racial/ethnic groups, prevalence of virtual-only learning showed more variability during September-December 2020 but declined steadily from January to April 2021. During January-April 2021, access to full-time in-person learning for non-Hispanic White students increased by 36.6 percentage points (from 38.0% to 74.6%), compared with 31.1 percentage points for non-Hispanic Black students (from 32.3% to 63.4%), 23.0 percentage points for Hispanic students (from 35.9% to 58.9%) and 30.6 percentage points for students of other races/ethnicities (from 26.3% to 56.9%). In January 2021, 39% of students in grades K-5 had access to full-time in-person learning compared with 33% of students in grades 6-8 and 30% of students in grades 9-12. Disparities in full-time in-person learning by race/ethnicity existed across school levels and by geographic region and state. These disparities underscore the importance of prioritizing equitable access to this learning mode for the 2021-22 school year. To increase equitable access to full-time in-person learning for the 2021-22 school year, school leaders should focus on providing safety-optimized in-person learning options across grade levels. CDC's K-12 operational strategy presents a pathway for schools to safely provide in-person learning through implementing recommended prevention strategies, increasing vaccination rates for teachers and older students with a focus on vaccine equity, and reducing community transmission (4).","Oster, Emily; Jack, Rebecca; Halloran, Clare; Schoof, John; McLeod, Diana; Yang, Haisheng; Roche, Julie; Roche, Dennis",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7026e2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34197363/,130

Fluid therapy administration due to dehydration, average weight gain, and the fecal microbiome were also evaluated. Bull calves used in this study were born from normal parturition, fed 4 L of pooled pasteurized colostrum by esophageal feeder, and moved to a research facility at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY). A double-blinded randomized clinical trial was designed to allocate a total of 40 newborn calves into 1 of 2 treatment groups: calves receiving (twice daily) a solution containing 500 mg of SB-300 added to the whole milk for the first 15 d of life (SB-300, n = 20) or a control group receiving sterile water added to whole milk for the same period (CTR, n = 20). Treatment solutions had a total volume of 10 mL per treatment. Data regarding fecal dry matter were collected to precisely measure water content in fecal samples and to define diarrhea events; the SB-300 group had significantly increased fecal dry matter during the study period. Additionally, significantly fewer events of diarrhea were observed for calves in the SB-300 group (16.9%) compared with calves in the CTR group (46.5%). Dehydration status was evaluated and treated accordingly; calves with moderate dehydration were offered oral electrolytes, and calves with severe dehydration were rescued with intravenous fluid therapy. Calves in the SB-300 group had fewer intravenous fluid therapies administered during the study period (1.6%) compared with the CTR group (3.1%). Overall fluid therapy administered (oral electrolytes plus intravenous fluids) was significantly higher for the CTR group (9.2%) compared with the SB-300 group (6.1%) during the study period.

This article discusses issues related to (science) communication at different phases of the COVID-19 epidemic timeline. We consider the role of communication for prevention from the ecological perspective, taking into consideration that many emerging pathogens, including COVID-19, likely arise in part due to anthropogenic changes to natural environments. Communication forms part of the early response setting the scene for public buy-in of public health interventions at the start of an outbreak, as well as to maintain precautions over time. Finally, communication is a key element in increasing acceptance for new tools that require mass uptake to be effective, as seen with roll-out challenges for the COVID-19 vaccines, which faced heightened concerns of efficacy and safety while mired with rampant misinformation. Ultimately, strategies for prevention of viral epidemics such as COVID-19 must include communication strategies at the forefront to reduce the risk of the emergence of new diseases and enhance efforts to control their spread and burden. Despite key themes emerging, what constitutes effective communication strategies for different people and contexts needs to be investigated further.","Mohd Hanafiah, Khayriyyah; Ng, Celine; Wan, Abdul Matiin",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13061058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34204909/,130

Our objectives were to characterize the common trajectories of COVID-19 symptoms and to assess how symptom course predicts other symptom changes as well as clinical deterioration. METHODS: One hundred sixty-two participants with acute COVID-19 responded to surveys up to 31 times for up to 17 days. Several statistical methods were used to characterize the temporal dynamics of these symptoms. Because 9 participants showed clinical deterioration, we explored whether these participants showed any differences in symptom profiles. RESULTS: Trajectories varied greatly between individuals, with many having persistently severe symptoms or developing new symptoms several days after being diagnosed. A typical trajectory was for a symptom to improve at a decremental rate, with most symptoms still persisting to some degree at the end of the reporting period. The pattern of symptoms over time suggested a fluctuating course for many patients. Participants who showed clinical deterioration were more likely to present with higher reports of severity of cough and diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: The course of symptoms during the initial weeks of COVID-19 is highly heterogeneous and is neither predictable nor easily characterized using typical survey methods. This has implications for clinical care and early-treatment clinical trials. Additional research is needed to determine whether the decelerating improvement pattern seen in our data is related to the phenomenon of patients reporting long-term symptoms and whether higher symptoms of diarrhea in early illness presages deterioration.","Rodebaugh, Thomas L; Frumkin, Madelyn R; Reiersen, Angela M; Lenze, Eric J; Avidan, Michael S; Miller, J Philip; Piccirillo, Jay F; Zorumski, Charles F; Mattar, Caline",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796601/,130

While large droplets and surface contamination can be relatively easier to deal with (i.e., using mask and proper hygiene measures), aerosol presents a different challenge due to their ability to remain airborne for a long time. This calls for mitigation solutions that can rapidly eliminate the airborne aerosol. Pre-COVID-19, air ionizers have been touted as effective tools to eliminate small particulates. In this work, we sought to evaluate the efficacy of a novel plant-based ionizer in eliminating aerosol. It was found that factors such as the ion concentration, humidity, and ventilation can drastically affect the efficacy of aerosol removal. The aerosol removal rate was quantified in terms of ACH (air changes per hour) and CADR- (clean air delivery rate-) equivalent unit, with ACH as high as 12 and CADR as high as 141 ft(3)/minute being achieved by a plant-based ionizer in a small isolated room. This work provides an important and timely guidance on the effective deployment of ionizers in minimizing the risk of COVID-19 spread via airborne aerosol, especially in a poorly-ventilated environment.","Suwardi, Ady; Ooi, Chin Chun; Daniel, Dan; Tan, Chee Kiang Ivan; Li, Hongying; Liang, Ou Yang Zhong; Tang, Yuanting Karen; Chee, Jing Yee; Sadovoy, Anton; Jiang, Shu-Ye; Ramachandran, Srinivasan; Ye, Enyi; Kang, Chang Wei; Cheong, Wun Chet Davy; Lim, Keng Hui; Loh, Xian Jun",Research (Wash D C),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33655212/; https://doi.org/10.34133/2021/2173642,130

The goal of this study was to evaluate the trends of the 2020 and 2021 integrated plastic surgery match specifically related to the 2019 novel coronavirus. METHODS: Three separate individual surveys were designed for integrated plastic surgery program directors and applicants from the 2021 to 2020 match. The surveys were distributed to the email addresses of applicants that applied to our institution’s integrated residency program. Information of current interns and newly matched applicants from program websites and certified social media accounts were recorded. RESULTS: We received completed surveys from 19 of the 69 program directors for a response rate of 27.5%. The survey for the 2020 and 2021 match applicants was completed by 25 and 68 applicants, respectively, for a response rate of 6.1% and 21.9%. There was a significant difference in the average number of completed virtual subinternships between applicants that did and did not successfully match into plastic surgery (1.48 versus 0.36, P = 0.01). The rate of students matching at their home institution was the highest in 2021 at 26% compared to 2020 (18%) and 2019 (15%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that applicants were more likely to match at programs with which they had established previous connections, including home institutions. Applicants also had a higher likelihood to match if they completed a virtual subinternship during the 2021 match.

Current biomedically-focused research on venoms is directed towards their use in delineating the physiological role of toxin molecular targets such as ion channels and receptors, studying or treating human diseases, targeting vectors of human diseases, and treating microbial and parasitic infections.

611865,"Antidepressants, primary care, and adult mental health services in England during COVID-19",2021-02-28,"Newer fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin and gemifloxacin have several attributes that make them excellent choices for the therapy of lower respiratory tract infections. In particular, they have excellent intrinsic activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and the atypical respiratory pathogens. Fluoroquinolones may be used as monotherapy to treat high-risk patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and for patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, but not admission to intensive care. Overall, the newer fluoroquinolones often achieve clinical cure rates in ≥90% of these patients. However, rates may be lower in hospital-acquired pneumonia, and this infection should be treated on the basis of anticipated organisms and evaluation of risk factors for specific pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this setting, an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone may be used in combination with an antipseu-domonal β-lactam. Concerns are now being raised about the widespread use, and possibly misuse, of fluoroquinolones and the emergence of resistance among S. pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. A number of pharmacokinetic parameters such as the peak concentration of the antibacterial after a dose (C(max)), and the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(24)) and their relationship to pharmacodynamic parameters such as the minimum inhibitory and the mutant prevention concentrations (MIC and MPC, respectively) have been proposed to predict the effect of fluoroquinolones on bacterial killing and the emergence of resistance. Higher C(max)/MIC or AUC(24)/MIC and C(max)/MPC or AUC(24)/MPC ratios, either as a result of dose administration or the susceptibility of the organism, may lead to a better clinical outcome and decrease the emergence of resistance, respectively. Pharmacokinetic profiles that are optimised to target low-level resistant minor subpopulations of bacteria that often exist in infections may help preserve fluoroquinolones as a class. To this end, optimising the AUC24/ MPC or Cmax/MPC ratios is important, particularly against S. pneumoniae, in the setting of lower respiratory tract infections. Agents such as moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin with high ratios against this organism are preferred, and agents such as ciprofloxacin with low ratios should be avoided. For agents such as levofloxacin and gatifloxacin, with intermediate ratios against S. pneumoniae, it may be worthwhile considering alternative dose administration strategies, such as using higher dosages, to eradicate low-level resistant variants. This must, of course, be balanced against the potential of toxicity. Innovative approaches to the use of fluoroquinolones are worth testing in further in vitro experiments as well as in clinical trials.","Shams, Wael E.; Evans, Martin E.",Drugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15892589/,130

We analyzed the three metagenomic datasets that sampled this batch of pangolins and found that the two complete pangolin CoV genomes, GD_1 by Xiao et al. Nature and MP789 by Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens, were both built primarily using the 2019 dataset first described by Liu et al. Viruses. Other publications, such as Zhang et al. Current Biology and Lam et al.

To our knowledge, all of the published pangolin CoV genome sequences that share a highly similar Spike receptor binding domain with SARS-CoV-2 originate from this singular batch of smuggled pangolins. This raises the question of whether pangolins are truly reservoirs or hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in the wild, or whether the pangolins may have contracted the CoV from another host species during trafficking.

Consequently, they have evolved varied mechanisms to co-opt host translation for their survival. SARS-CoV-2 relies on a non-structural protein, NSP1, for shutting down host translation. Despite this, it is currently unknown how viral proteins and host factors critical for viral replication can escape a global shutdown of host translation. Here, using a novel FACS-based assay called MeTAFlow, we report a dose-dependent reduction in both nascent protein synthesis and mRNA abundance in cells expressing NSP1. We perform RNA-Seq and matched ribosome profiling experiments to identify gene-specific changes both at the mRNA expression and translation level. We discover a functionally-coherent subset of human genes preferentially translated in the context of NSP1 expression. These genes include the translation machinery components, RNA binding proteins, and others important for viral pathogenicity. Importantly, we also uncover potential mechanisms of preferential translation through the presence of shared sites for specific RNA binding proteins and a remarkable enrichment for 5′ terminal oligo-pyrimidine tracts. Collectively, the present study suggests fine tuning of host gene expression and translation by NSP1 despite its global repressive effect on host protein synthesis.","Rao, Shilpa; Hoskins, Ian; Garcia, P.

Four of 15 women provided liquid colostrum, which was used for validating results obtained from spot cards. Archived bilateral colostrum samples collected from 8 women during 2011-2013 were used as pre-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) controls. All samples were tested for reactivity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that measures SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM and for levels of 10 inflammatory cytokines (interferon-gamma [IFN-γ], tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13) using a multiplex electrochemiluminescent sandwich assay. Results: Our validation studies indicate that the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and the associated cytokines measured in liquid colostrum are comparable to levels eluted from spot cards. Bilateral colostrum samples from 73%, 73%, and 33% of the 15 COVID-19 mothers exhibited IgA, IgG, and IgM reactivity to RBD, respectively. In addition, symptomatic COVID-19 mothers had statistically significant elevated levels of 4 of the 10 inflammatory markers (IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-12) compared to asymptomatic COVID-19 mothers. Conclusions: A strong humoral immune response is present in the colostrum of women who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 before delivering.

Cells were stained with convalescent serum of the patients to identify infected cells and apical washes were analyzed by VIDISCA-454, a next-generation sequencing virus discovery technique. RESULTS: Infected cells were observed for all three samples. Sequencing subsequently indicated that the cells were infected by either human coronavirus OC43, influenzavirus B, or influenzavirus A. The sequence reads covered a large part of the genome (52%, 82%, and 57%, respectively).

Covid‐19‐related encephalopathy has seldom been reported and studied. METHODS: We report four cases of Covid‐19‐related encephalopathy. The diagnosis was made in patients with confirmed Covid‐19 who presented with new‐onset cognitive disturbances, central focal neurological signs or seizures. All patients underwent cognitive screening, brain MRI, lumbar puncture, and brain FDG‐PET/CT. RESULTS: The four patients were 60 years of age or older, and presented with various degrees of cognitive impairment, with predominant frontal lobe impairment. Two patients presented with cerebellar syndrome, one had myoclonus, one had psychiatric manifestations, and one patient had status epilepticus. The delay between first Covid‐19 symptoms and onset of neurological symptoms was between 0 and 12 days. None of the patients had MRI features of encephalitis nor significant CSF abnormalities. SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐PCR in the CSF was negative for all patients. All patients presented with a consistent brain FDG‐PET/CT pattern of abnormalities, namely frontal hypometabolism and cerebellar hypermetabolism. All patients improved after immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Despite varied clinical presentations, all patients presented with a consistent FDG‐PET pattern which may reflect an immune mechanism.","Delorme, Cécile; Paccoud, Olivier; Kas, Aurélie; Hesters, Adèle; Bombois, Stéphanie; Shambrook, Pauline; Boullet, Augustin; Doukhi, Diana; Le Guennec, Loic; Godefroy, Nagisa; Maatoug, Redwan; Fossati, Philippe; Millet, Bruno; Navarro, Vincent; Bruneteau, Gaelle; Demeret, Sophie; Pourcher, Valérie",Eur J Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32881133/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14478,130

METHOD: We conducted a qualitative study using semi‐structured interviews and a phenomenological‐hermeneutic approach, to get an understanding of the older participants' perspectives and lived experiences. Complete interviews were available for 11 patients—six men and five women, between 69 and 91 years of age. RESULTS: The participants' narratives identified several themes. Feeling isolated from and having no contact with close relatives or carers was prominent. The COVID‐19 pandemic created fear and anxiety among hospitalized patients. Relationships with family members and some staff became strained. The transformation from being “a person” to being “a patient” and loss of dignity, autonomy and a “sense of self” were themes identified in the analysis. Although virtual contact can't replace the real world, the use of technology to maintain contact with family and carers, and the need for help from hospital staff in facilitating this contact was deemed important. The environment of care was a prominent theme. The attitude of staff made a difference to how patients felt and some patients expressed a loss of decision‐making capability. The interviews were challenging in some cases because the interviews had to be interrupted or shortened due to ethical considerations around the individual person's needs and condition. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: Our study provided in‐depth knowledge on how older patients experienced hospitalisation during the COVID‐19 pandemic in a Danish hospital. The results emphasise that compassionate care includes a willingness to listen to older patients' narratives and to imagine life as depicted by them. This can lead to better understanding of an individual person's needs and increase the quality of care provided.","Nielsen, Dorthe Susanne; Hansen, Rikke Frøslev; Beck, Sanne Have; Wensien, Jette; Masud, Tahir; Ryg, Jesper",Int J Older People Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1111/opn.12362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33389798/,130

In addition to being the first European country to be heavily swept by the COVID-19 pandemic, Italy was the first to introduce stringent lockdown measures. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and related COVID-19 pandemic have been the worst public health challenge endured in recent history by Italy. Two months since the beginning of the first wave, the estimated excess deaths in Lombardy, the hardest hit region in the country, reached a peak of more than 23,000 deaths. The extraordinary pressures exerted on the Italian Servizio Sanitario Nazionale (SSN) inevitably leads to questions about its preparedness and the appropriateness and effectiveness of responses implemented at both national and regional levels.

It can be induced by bacteria, fungi or viruses. We hypothesized that the assessment of MR-proADM, with or without other inflammatory cytokines, as part of a clinical assessment of COVID-19 patients at hospital admission, may assist in identifying those likely to develop severe disease. A pragmatic retrospective analysis was performed on a complete data set from 111 patients admitted to Udine University Hospital, in northern Italy, from 25th March to 15th May 2020, affected by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Clinical scoring systems (SOFA score, WHO disease severity class, SIMEU clinical phenotype), cytokines (IL-6, IL-1b, IL-8, TNF-α), and MR-proADM were measured. Demographic, clinical and outcome data were collected for analysis. At multivariate analysis, high MR-proADM levels were significantly associated with negative outcome (death or orotracheal intubation, IOT), with an odds ratio of 4.284 [1.893–11.413], together with increased neutrophil count (OR = 1.029 [1.011–1.049]) and WHO disease severity class (OR = 7.632 [5.871–19.496]). AUROC analysis showed a good discriminative performance of MR-proADM (AUROC: 0.849 [95% Cl 0.771–0.730]; p < 0.0001). The optimal value of MR-proADM to discriminate combined event of death or IOT is 0.895 nmol/l, with a sensitivity of 0.857 [95% Cl 0.728–0.987] and a specificity of 0.687 [95% Cl 0.587–0.787]. This study shows an association between MR-proADM levels and the severity of COVID-19. The assessment of MR-proADM combined with clinical scoring systems could be of great value in triaging, evaluating possible escalation of therapies, and admission avoidance or inclusion into trials. Larger prospective and controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.","Sozio, Emanuela; Tascini, Carlo; Fabris, Martina; D’Aurizio, Federica; De Carlo, Chiara; Graziano, Elena; Bassi, Flavio; Sbrana, Francesco; Ripoli, Andrea; Pagotto, Alberto; Giacinta, Alessandro; Gerussi, Valentina; Visentini, Daniela; De Stefanis, Paola; Merelli, Maria; Saeed, Kordo; Curcio, Francesco",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33664308/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-84478-1,130

This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health, sexual function, and quality of life (QoL) in Iranian pregnant and lactating women and compare the results with non-pregnant/non-lactating women. METHOD: This comparative cross-sectional study was carried out on pregnant and lactating women, with non-pregnant/non-lactating women from May to Jun 2020. Patients were asked to complete three questionnaires: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). One-way ANOVA was used to reveal the statistical differences between the three groups. RESULT: The mean age of patients was 20.81 ± 5.92 years old. The mean (SD) score of HADS in pregnant, lactating and non-pregnant / non-lactating women were 12.11 (6.72), 11.98 (8.44) and 9.38 (6.2) respectively, and the results showed that the scores in pregnant, lactating women were higher than non-pregnant / non-lactating women (P < 0.001). Also the mean (SD) score of QOL and FSFI was 68.29 (9.47), 74.18 (12.65), 79.03 (10.48) and 22.71 (8.16), 22.72 (8.16), 26.19 (3.93) in three groups and the scores in pregnant, lactating women were lower than non-pregnant/non-lactating women (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 epidemic increases the risk of depression, anxiety, FSD, and lowers QoL in pregnant and lactating women, with the general population.

While government measures are necessary in an external crisis such as the current pandemic, negative effects can also arise from excessive government intervention, particularly for the economy. An analysis of the OECD countries shows that the state already played a major role in the economies of many countries before the coronavirus crisis, especially in Germany. However, state participation in companies does not necessarily have to lead to negative effects if it is structured appropriately. This article discusses how government measures, especially the extension of public ownership, should be designed in order to maintain competition and use the free market as an allocation instrument where possible. This means that no market structures should be created which could not have been created or which fail to comply with competition law.

What counts as sickness, disease, injury, pathology, is fundamentally a matter of historically situated social ideas and values. 2. The ways in which societies are organized is a fundamental source of pathologies and their distributions within societies. 3. Conversely, health conditions can substantially alter the organization of societies. 4. Public health responses are social processes that affect intervention outcomes.

Long-term sequalae of COVID-19 over the course of a lifetime currently are unknown; however, persistent symptoms and serious complications are being reported among COVID-19 survivors, including persons who initially experience a mild acute illness.* On December 11, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to prevent COVID-19, administered as 2 doses separated by 21 days. On December 12, 2020, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued an interim recommendation for use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (1); initial doses were recommended for health care personnel and long-term care facility residents (2). As of December 23, 2020, a reported 1,893,360 first doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine had been administered in the United States, and reports of 4,393 (0.2%) adverse events after receipt of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine had been submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Among these, 175 case reports were identified for further review as possible cases of severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that does occur rarely after vaccination, with onset typically within minutes to hours (3). Twenty-one cases were determined to be anaphylaxis (a rate of 11.1 per million doses administered), including 17 in persons with a documented history of allergies or allergic reactions, seven of whom had a history of anaphylaxis. The median interval from vaccine receipt to symptom onset was 13 minutes (range = 2-150 minutes). Among 20 persons with follow-up information available, all had recovered or been discharged home. Of the remaining case reports that were determined not to be anaphylaxis, 86 were judged to be nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, and 61 were considered nonallergic adverse events. Seven case reports were still under investigation. This report summarizes the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of case reports of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, after receipt of the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine during December 14-23, 2020, in the United States. CDC has issued updated interim clinical considerations for use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized in the United States (4) and interim considerations for preparing for the potential management of anaphylaxis (5). In addition to screening for contraindications and precautions before administering COVID-19 vaccines, vaccine locations should have the necessary supplies available to manage anaphylaxis, should implement postvaccination observation periods, and should immediately treat persons experiencing anaphylaxis signs and symptoms with intramuscular injection of epinephrine (4,5).",,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7002e1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33444297/,130
622887,Mental health symptoms in a cohort of hospital healthcare workers following the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK,2020-12-29,"Six volunteers experienced severe inflammatory response during the Phase I clinical trial of a monoclonal antibody that was designed to stimulate a regulatory T cell response. Soon after the trial began, each volunteer experienced a “cytokine storm”, a dramatic increase in cytokine concentrations. The monoclonal antibody, TGN1412, raised serum concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines το very hiγh values during the first day, while lymphocyte and monocyte concentrations plummeted. Because the subjects were healthy and had no prior indications of immune deficiency, this event provided an unusual opportunity to study the dynamic interactions of cytokines and other measured parameters. Here, the response histories of nine cytokines have been modeled by a set of linear ordinary differential equations. A general search procedure identifies parameters of the model, whose response fits the data well during the five-day measurement period. The eighteenth-order model reveals plausible cause-and-effect relationships among the cytokines, showing how each cytokine induces or inhibits other cytokines. It suggests that perturbations in IL2, IL8, and IL10 have the most significant inductive effect, while IFN-γ and IL12 have the greatest inhibiting effect on other cytokine concentrations. Although TNF-α is a major pro-inflammatory factor, IFN-γ and three other cytokines have faster initial and median response to TGN1412 infusion. Principal-component analysis of the data reveals three clusters of similar cytokine responses: [TNF-α, IL1, IL10], [IFN-γ, IL2, IL4, IL8, and IL12], and [IL6]. IL1, IL6, IL10, and TNF-α have the highest degree of variability in response to uncertain initial conditions, exogenous effects, and parameter estimates. This study illuminates details of a cytokine storm event, and it demonstrates the value of linear modeling for interpreting complex, coupled biological system dynamics from empirical data.","Yiu, Hao Hong; Graham, Andrea L.; Stengel, Robert F.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23049677/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0045027,130
623174,Perceived barriers to physical activity during the 2nd lockdown in a northeastern state of Brazil,2021-09-02,"Dental health care workers are in close contact to their patients and are therefore at higher risk for contracting airborne infectious diseases. The transmission rates of airborne pathogens from patient to dental health care workers are unknown. With the outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as seasonal influenza, occasional outbreaks of measles and tuberculosis, and the current pandemic of the coronavirus disease COVID-19, it is important to estimate the risks for dental health care workers. Therefore, the transmission probability of these airborne infectious diseases was estimated via mathematical modeling. The transmission probability was modeled for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, measles virus, influenza virus, and coronaviruses per a modified version of the Wells-Riley equation. This equation incorporated the indoor air quality by using carbon dioxide as a proxy and added the respiratory protection rate from medical face masks and N95 respirators. Scenario-specific analyses, uncertainty analyses, and sensitivity analyses were run to produce probability rates. A high transmission probability was characterized by high patient infectiousness, the absence of respiratory protection, and poor indoor air quality. The highest transmission probabilities were estimated for measles virus (100%), coronaviruses (99.4%), influenza virus (89.4%), and M. tuberculosis (84.0%). The low-risk scenario leads to transmission probabilities of 4.5% for measles virus and 0% for the other pathogens. From the sensitivity analysis, it shows that the transmission probability is strongly driven by indoor air quality, followed by patient infectiousness, and the least by respiratory protection from medical face mask use. Airborne infection transmission of pathogens such as measles virus and coronaviruses is likely to occur in the dental practice. The risk magnitude, however, is highly dependent on specific conditions in each dental clinic. Improved indoor air quality by ventilation, which reduces carbon dioxide, is the most important factor that will either strongly increase or decrease the probability of the transmission of a pathogen.","Zemouri, C.; Awad, S.F.; Volgenant, C.M.C.; Crielaard, W.; Laheij, A.M.G.A.; de Soet, J.J.",J Dent Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32614681/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0022034520940288,130

On January 30th, World Health Organization declared it as a “Public Emergency of International Concern,” which continuous its devastation all over the world. Currently 2,578,996 COVID-19 infections have been reported all over the world. China, Italy, United Kingdom, and United States of America are among the most affected areas by COVID-19. Italy suffered with 183,975 cases and 24,684 deaths so far. USA has 819,175 confirmed cases and 45,343 deaths whereas UK has 129,044 confirmed cases with 17,337 deaths. China had total infections of 82,788, and they were able to contain the virus. This showed a light that to contain the virus, there is a need of appropriate screening, isolation, and priority first aid treatment. These steps need to be taken to buy the time for the pharmaceutical to make the vaccine. A diagnosis of gold standard is nucleic acid testing and RT-PCR detection from viral RNA, which becomes quite challenging because of the laboratory testing quality and its availability. To combat this disease, there is a dire need of an alternative diagnostic method. Study of radio-graphic computed tomography images of COVID-19 gives the idea that deep learning methods can be implemented to extract specific features of COVID-19 aiding the clinical diagnosis. For this matter, a major part of data scientists and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers formed methods for screening of COVID-19 by AI means. These AI solutions related to the screening of COVID-19 will be discussed in this chapter. In addition, we propose a deep neural network which is trained on the X-ray images of the COVID-19 patients and normal X-ray images for the detection of COVID-19. Our method achieved validation accuracy of 0.95 which is quite promising accuracy for the classification of COVID-19 patients from the healthy ones.","Munir, Khushboo; Elahi, Hassan; Farooq, Muhammad Umar; Ahmed, Sana; Frezza, Fabrizio; Rizzi, Antonello",Data Science for COVID-19,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128245361000393; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128245361000393,130

An Analysis of Care Seeking and Equity in 24 USAID Priority Countries,2020-10-01,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the agreement of a home vision screening test compared to standard in-office technician-measured Snellen visual acuity to allow for remote screening and triaging of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, English-speaking patients with in-office ophthalmology appointments from May to August 2020 and visual acuity better than 20/125 were asked to complete a home vision test one week before their scheduled in-office appointment. The home vision test was a modified ETDRS chart displayed in a PDF document that could be printed or viewed on a monitor. The primary outcome was the mean difference between office-based and home visual acuity. RESULTS: Eighty-two eyes of 45 patients were included in the study with 45 study eyes analyzed. The mean difference between office-based and home visual acuity was −0.02 logMAR (SD 0.15, P=0.28) among study eyes. Of these eyes, 91% demonstrated agreement between the two methods within 0.2 logMAR of the mean difference, and 60% had agreement within 0.1 logMAR of the mean difference. There were no significant demographic or ocular risk factors leading to a greater difference between the tests. CONCLUSION: There was good agreement between the home and in-office Snellen tests for patients with vision better than 20/125. The home vision test can be used to remotely determine if there is a significant vision change of >0.2 logMAR or approximately 2 lines of visual acuity.","Chen, Tiffany A; Li, Jonathan; Schallhorn, Julie M; Sun, Catherine Q",Clin Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.2147/opth.s309727; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34349497/,130

In this study we sought to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a population of HCWs in a pediatric emergency department (ED). METHODS: We conducted this observational cohort study from April 14–May 13, 2020 in a pediatric ED in Orange County, CA. Asymptomatic HCW ≥18 years of age were included in the study. Blood samples were obtained by fingerstick at the start of each shift. The inter-sampling interval was ≤96 hours. The primary outcome was positive seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 as determined with an antibody fast detection kit (Colloidal Gold, Superbio, Timisoara, Romania) for the SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M/immunoglobulin G (IgM/IgG) antibody. RESULTS: A total of 143 HCWs participated in the study. Overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 10.5% (n = 15). Positive seroprevalence was classified as IgG only (4.9%), IgM+IgG (3.5%), or IgM only (2.1%). SARS-CoV-2 was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR in 0.7% of the overall study population (n = 1). Samples obtained on Day 1 indicated seropositivity in 4.2% of the study population (n = 6). Subsequent seroconversion occurred in 6.3% of participants (n = 9). The rate of seroconversion was linear with a rate of approximately one new case every two days, starting at Day 9 of the study. CONCLUSION: We observed a linear rate of seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2–positive status among asymptomatic HCWs who underwent daily symptom surveys and temperature screens in an environment with universal source control. Rapid antibody testing may be useful for screening for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in high-risk populations, such as HCWs in the ED.","Heyming, Theodore W.; Sanger, Terence; Tongol, Aprille; Schomberg, John; Bacon, Kellie; Lara, Bryan",West J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2021.1.50058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34125028/,130

The phrase ‘blessed by the algorithm’ expresses the feeling of having been fortunate in what appears on your feed on various social media platforms, or in the success or virality of your content as a creator, or in what gig economy jobs you are offered. However, we can also place it within wider public discourse employing theistic conceptions of AI. Building on anthropological fieldwork into the ‘entanglements of AI and Religion’ (Singler 2017a), this article will explore how ‘blessed by the algorithm’ tweets are indicative of the impact of theistic AI narratives: modes of thinking about AI in an implicitly religious way. This thinking also represents continuities that push back against the secularisation thesis and other grand narratives of disenchantment that claim secularity occurs because of technological and intellectual progress. This article will also explore new religious movements, where theistic conceptions of AI entangle technological aspirations with religious ones.","Singler, Beth",AI Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32355422/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-020-00968-2,130
629203,Response to: Rethinking online mental health services in China during the COVID-19 epidemic,2020-06-30,"Analysing learners’ behaviours in MOOCs has been used to identify predictive features associated with positive outcomes in engagement and learning success. Early methods predominantly analysed numerical features of behaviours such as the page views, video views, and assessment grades. Analysing extracted numeric features using baseline machine learning algorithms performed well to predict the learners’ future performance in MOOCs. We propose categorising learners by likely English language proficiency and extending the range of data to include the content of comment texts. We compare results to a model trained with a combined set of extracted features. Not all platforms provide this rich variety of data. We analysed a series of a FutureLearn language focused MOOCs. Our data were from discussions embedded into each lesson’s content. Analysing whether we gained any additional insights, over 420,000 comments were used to train the algorithm. We created a method for identifying one’s possible first language from their country. We found that using comments alone is a weaker predictive approach than using a combination including extracted features from learners’ activities. Our study contributes to research on generalisability of learning algorithms. We replicated the method across different MOOCs—the performance varies on the model though it always remained over 50%.

The portable rescue device could be used in clinical applications in outbreaks of viral pneumonia such as SARS. To reduce energy consumption for battery-powered portable usage, NO micro-channel plasma reactions induced by a continuous discharge arc were employed. A single-use airway tube could be combined with an intubation tube in clinical applications. In the experiment, a switching transistor controlled high frequency DC (12.5 kHz) was used to create a continuous discharge arc between two stainless steel electrodes (1-mm separation) after high-voltage breakthrough. A rotate instrument was employed to change the direction angle between the airflow and discharge arc, tube filled with Calcium hydroxide connected with gas outlet for reducing NO(2), gas flow rate and input voltage were evaluated separately with concentration of NO and NO(2)/NO ratio. Results showed that a 2 L/min air flow direction from the cathode to the anode of electrodes (direction angle was zero) under 4 V input voltages produced 32.5±3.8 ppm NO, and the NO(2)/NO ratio reduced to less than 10%, stable output of nitric oxide might be convenient and effective for NO inhalation therapy. Modularization of the design produced a portable NO inhalation device that has potential for use in clinical applications as it is low cost, easy to disinfect, consumes low levels of energy and is ready to use.","Qian, Li; Wenlu, Zhang; Hong, Wang; Juan, Deng; Xinli, Tian; Linlin, Wang; Hong, Sha",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32790732/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237604,130

To examine the spatiotemporal changes in the transmission potential, we present regional estimates of the doubling time and reproduction number (Rt ) of COVID-19 in the country. Methods Daily series of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the most affected regions were extracted from publicly available sources. We employed established mathematical and statistical methods to investigate the time-varying reproduction numbers of the COVID-19 in Korea and its doubling time, respectively. Results At the regional level, Seoul and Gyeonggi Province have experienced the first peak of COVID-19 in early March, followed by the second wave in early June, withRt exceeding 3.0 and mean doubling time ranging from 3.6 to 10.1 days. As of 19 July, 2020, Gyeongbuk Province and Daegu are yet to experience a second wave of the disease, where the mean Rt reached 3.5-4.4 and doubling time ranging from 2.8 to 4.6 days during the first wave.

COVID-19 has a highly variable clinical presentation, ranging from asymptomatic to severe respiratory symptoms and death. Diabetes seems to be one of the main comorbidities contributing to a worse COVID-19 outcome. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective study of 417 consecutive COVID-19 patients in Kuwait, we analyze and compare disease severity, outcome, associated complications, and clinical laboratory findings between diabetic and non-diabetic COVID-19 patients. Results: COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, such as hypertension, higher levels of inflammatory markers, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and a higher incidence of complications. All of these factors could lead to more severe outcomes and higher mortality than non-diabetic COVID-19 patients.

The aim of this study was to investigate oral health status, oral healthcare behaviors, and parental attitudes toward oral healthcare among school-age children in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak and what the status would be when the outbreak is under control. Methods: This study was an online cross-sectional survey facing elementary school students in Wuhan. The questionnaire was completed by children's parents or other family members. The information on demographic data, oral health status, oral healthcare behaviors, and parental attitudes toward oral healthcare was collected at the end of school closure. The chi-square test was used to test the association of different questionnaire items. Results: A total of 18,383 subjects aged 6–13 years with complete data were included in this investigation, and 44.2% of them suffered pain or discomfort related to teeth and gums during the epidemic. While there might be an increasing need and concern of oral healthcare during the outbreak and even when the outbreak was controlled, the worry of infection made it difficult for people to meet their demands of dental attendance. Conclusion: The risk of cross-infection during the treatment had a negative influence on parental attitudes toward dental attendance.

Novel adjuvants may improve the protective immunity conferred by vaccines against poultry diseases. Here, a less-hemolytic saponin, platycodin D (PD), isolated from the root of Platycodon grandiflorum was investigated as a potential alternative adjuvant. PD was tested as an adjuvant in the infectious bronchitis (IB) vaccine, because the existing IB vaccine has often failed to induce effective immune responses. The adjuvant activity of PD in conjunction with IB vaccine was evaluated in this study. Compared to control treatment, PD treatment significantly increased the proliferation of chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells, concentration of interferon-γ in culture supernatants, and anti-IB antibody titer. In chickens pre-challenged with the Mass 41 infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), PD administration resulted in fewer and less severe clinical signs, lower mortality rate, and higher protection compared to control treatment. Histopathological examination showed that the lungs and kidneys of PD-treated chickens displayed fewer pathological lesions than those of control chickens. Our results also demonstrated that this new vaccine adjuvant improved chicken humoral and cellular immune responses without any side effects.

However, in the United States race and temperature correlate with various other social determinants of health, comorbidities, and environmental influences that could be responsible for noted effects. This study investigates the independent effects of race and environmental temperature on COVID-19 incidence and mortality in United States counties. METHODS: Data on COVID-19 and risk factors in all United States counties was collected. 661 counties with at least 50 COVID-19 cases and 217 with at least 10 deaths were included in analyses. Upper and lower quartiles for cases/100,000 people and halves for deaths/100,000 people were compared with t-tests. Adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent effects of race and environmental temperature. RESULTS: Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated Black race is a risk factor for increased COVID-19 cases (OR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.09-1.40, P=0.001) and deaths independent of comorbidities, poverty, access to health care, and other risk factors. Higher environmental temperature independently reduced caseload (OR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.71-0.91, P=0.0009), but not deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Higher environmental temperatures correlated with reduced COVID-19 cases, but this benefit does not yet appear in mortality models. Black race was an independent risk factor for increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Thus, many proposed mechanisms through which Black race might increase risk for COVID-19, such as socioeconomic and healthcare-related predispositions, are inadequate in explaining the full magnitude of this health disparity.","Li, Adam Y.; Hannah, Theodore C; Durbin, John R; Dreher, Nickolas; McAuley, Fiona M; Marayati, Naoum Fares; Spiera, Zachary; Ali, Muhammad; Gometz, Alex; Kostman, JT; Choudhri, Tanvir F.",Am J Med Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002962920302573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709397/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002962920302573?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjms.2020.06.015,130

There are currently several licensed vaccines approved for human use and most of them target the spike protein in the virion envelope to induce protective immunity. Recently, variants that spread more quickly have emerged. There is evidence that some of these variants are less sensitive to neutralization in vitro, but it is not clear whether they can evade vaccine induced protection. In this study, we tested SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD as a vaccine antigen and explored the effect of formulation with Alum/MPLA or AddaS03 adjuvants. Our results show that RBD induces high titers of neutralizing antibodies and activates strong cellular immune responses. There is also significant cross-neutralization of variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 and to a lesser extent, SARS-CoV-1.

However, various measures and modifications can be put in place to limit or reduce the risk of further spread of COVID-19 for the mass gathering. During this pandemic, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security produced a risk assessment and mitigation tool for decision-makers to assess SARS-CoV-2 transmission risks that may arise as organizations and businesses hold mass gatherings or increase business operations: The JHU Operational Toolkit for Businesses Considering Reopening or Expanding Operations in COVID-19 (Toolkit). This article describes the deployment of a data-informed, risk-reduction strategy that protects local communities, preserves local health-care capacity, and supports democratic processes through the safe execution of the Republican National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. The successful use of the Toolkit and the lessons learned from this experience are applicable in a wide range of public health settings, including school reopening, expansion of public services, and even resumption of health-care delivery.","Callaway, David; Runge, Jeff; Mullen, Lucia; Rentz, Lisa; Staley, Kevin; Stanford, Michael; Watson, Crystal",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762039/; https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.499,130

This global situation may have a negative impact on the psychological well‐being of individuals which in turn impacts individuals' performance. This study aims to explore the prevalence of depression and anxiety among the GP, HCPs, and USs during COVID‐19 outbreak, and to identify key population(s) who might need psychological intervention. METHODS: A cross‐sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Jordan between 22 and 28 March 2020 to explore the mental health status (depression and anxiety) of the general population, healthcare professionals, and university students during the COVID‐19 outbreak. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ‐9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder‐7 (GAD‐7) were used to assess depression and anxiety among the study participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression and anxiety among the entire study participants was 23.8% and 13.1%, respectively. Anxiety was most prevalent across university students 21.5%, followed by healthcare professionals 11.3%, and general population 8.8%. Females among healthcare professionals and university students, divorced healthcare professionals, pulmonologists, and university students with history of chronic disease were at higher risk of developing depression. Females, divorced participants among the general population, and university students with history of chronic disease and those with high income (≥1,500 JD) were at higher risk of developing anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: During outbreaks, individuals are put under extreme stressful condition resulting in higher risk of developing anxiety and depression particularly for students and healthcare professionals. Policymakers and mental healthcare providers are advised to provide further mental support to these vulnerable groups during this pandemic.","Naser, Abdallah Y.; Dahmash, Eman Zmaily; Al‐Rousan, Rabaa; Alwafi, Hassan; Alrawashdeh, Hamzeh Mohammad; Ghoul, Imene; Abidine, Anwer; Bokhary, Mohammed A.; AL‐Hadithi, Hadeel T.; Ali, Dalia; Abuthawabeh, Rasha; Abdelwahab, Ghada Mohammad; Alhartani, Yosra J.; Al Muhaisen, Haneen; Dagash, Ayah; Alyami, Hamad S.",Brain Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32578943/; https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1730,130

There is uncertainty whether these occur due to direct neuroinvasion of the virus, para-infectious immunopathology, as result of systemic complications of disease such as hypercoagulability or due to a combination of these mechanisms. Here we describe clinical and radiological manifestations in a sequential cohort of patients presenting to a district hospital in South Africa with neurological symptoms with and without confirmed COVID-19 during the first peak of the epidemic. In these patients, where symptoms suggestive of meningitis and encephalitis were most common, thorough assessment of presence in CSF via PCR for SARS-CoV2 did not explain neurological presentations, notwithstanding very high rates of COVID-19 admissions. Although an understanding of potential neurotropic mechanisms remains an important area of research, these results provide rationale for greater focus towards the understanding of para-immune pathogenic processes and the contribution of systemic coagulopathy and their interaction with pre-existing risk factors in order to better manage neurological disease in the context of COVID-19. These results also inform the clinician that consideration of an alternative diagnosis and treatment for neurological presentations in this context is crucial, even in the patient with a confirmed diagnosis COVID-19.","Davis, A.

A wealth of data has been generated since its emergence in December 2019 and it is vital for clinicians to keep up with this data from across the world at a time of uncertainty and constantly evolving guidelines and clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: Here we provide an update for clinicians on the recent developments about virology, diagnostics, clinical presentation, viral shedding, and treatment options for COVID-19 based on current literature. SOURCES: We considered published peer-reviewed papers and non-peer-reviewed pre-print manuscripts on COVID19 and related aspects with an emphasis on clinical management aspects. CONTENT: We describe the virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and clinical course of COVID-19 with an emphasis on diagnostic challenges, duration of viral shedding, severity markers and current treatment options. IMPLICATIONS: The key challenge in managing COVID-19 remains the patient density. However, accurate diagnoses as well as early identification and management of high-risk severe cases are important for many clinicians. For improved management of cases, there is a need to understand test probability of serology, qRT-PCR and radiological testing, and the efficacy of available treatment options that could be used in severe cases with a high risk of mortality.","Cevik, Muge; Bamford, Connor; Ho, Antonia",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20302317; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20302317?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.04.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32344166/,130

Materials and methods Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. The OE-MRI was based on a respiratory-gated three-dimensional (3D) radial UTE sequence. For each patient, the percent signal enhancement (PSE) map was calculated using the expression PSE = (S100% – S21%)/S21%, where S21% and S100% are signals acquired during room air and 100% oxygen inhalation, respectively. Agreement of lesion detectability between UTE-MRI and computed tomography (CT) was performed using the kappa test. The Mann–Whitney U-test was used to evaluate the difference in the mean PSE between mild-type COVID-19 and common-type COVID-19. Spearman’s test was used to assess the relationship between lesion mean PSE and lesion size. Furthermore, the Mann–Whitney U-test was used to evaluate the difference in region of interest (ROI) mean PSE between normal pulmonary parenchyma and lesions. The Kruskal–Wallis test was applied to test the difference in the mean PSE between different lesion types. Results CT and UTE-MRI reached good agreement in lesion detectability. Ventilation measures in mild-type patients (5.3 ± 5.5%) were significantly different from those in common-type patients (3 ± 3.9%). Besides, there was no significant correlation between lesion mean PSE and lesion size. The mean PSE of COVID-19 lesions (3.2 ± 4.9%) was significantly lower than that of the pulmonary parenchyma (5.4 ± 3.9%). No significant difference was found among different lesion types. Conclusion OE-UTE-MRI could serve as a promising method for the assessment of lung function or treatment management of COVID-19 patients.","Zhao, Fang; Zheng, Liyun; Shan, Fei; Dai, Yongming; Shen, Jie; Yang, Shuyi; Shi, Yuxin; Xue, Ke; Zhang, Zhiyong",Clin Radiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000992602100091X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2021.02.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33712292/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000992602100091X?v=s5,130

However, this impact is not widespread throughout the population, and men and women may be affected differently and it is not known what protective factors may exist. In this sense, physical activity has classically been shown to be a habit associated with psychological health. The study aimed to analyze the impact of confinement on psychological health (psychological well-being, coping, emotions, and perception of daily difficulties), taking into account gender, and perceived changes in physical activity. After the project was approved by the University’s Ethics Commission, the participants, after signing the informed consent, completed the online questionnaires during the days from 6 to 20 April, the time when, in Spain, confinement was in place and the highest peak of deaths and infections from COVID-19 occurred. A total of 457 Spanish participants (247 men and 210 women) were evaluated in psychological well-being, in its adaptation to Spanish, in coping, with the Spanish adaptation of the COPE Inventory, in daily habits and difficulties (ad hoc questionnaire) and the level of physical activity they had (sedentary, active, and federated players) was recorded. Besides, the perceived change in physical activity due to confinement was recorded. The results showed that perceived emotions, difficulties for certain routines, psychological well-being, and coping differed according to sex. On the other hand, depending on the change in physical activity habits, it was observed that participants who increased their physical activity responded differently in the perception of emotions, and difficulties for routines and in psychological well-being. Finally, differences were also observed in most variables between sedentary, active, and federated participants. Results are discussed highlighting the importance of physical activity as a moderating factor of the impact of confinement.","León-Zarceño, Eva; Moreno-Tenas, Antonio; Boix Vilella, Salvador; García-Naveira, Alejo; Serrano-Rosa, Miguel Angel",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.620745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33679535/,130

However, it is still poorly understood how animals can cope with and adapt to these rapid and dramatic transformations of natural environments. The COVID-19 pandemic provides us with a unique opportunity to unveil the mechanisms involved in this process. Lockdown measures imposed in most countries are causing an unprecedented reduction of human activities, giving us an experimental setting to assess the effects of our lifestyle on biodiversity. We studied the birds' response to the population lockdown by using more than 126 000 bird records collected by a citizen science project in northeastern Spain. We compared the occurrence and detectability of birds during the spring 2020 lockdown with baseline data from previous years in the same urban areas and dates. We found that birds did not increase their probability of occurrence in urban areas during the lockdown, refuting the hypothesis that nature has recovered its space in human-emptied urban areas. However, we found an increase in bird detectability, especially during early morning, suggesting a rapid change in the birds’ daily routines in response to quieter and less crowded cities. Therefore, urban birds show high behavioural plasticity to rapidly adjust to novel environmental conditions, such as those imposed by the COVID-19.","Gordo, Oscar; Brotons, Lluís; Herrando, Sergi; Gargallo, Gabriel",Proceedings.

Our study aimed to examine this phenomenon by analyzing news media coverage published between December 31, 2019-June 30, 2020 on COVID-related anti-Asian incidents. METHOD: We utilized a phenomenological approach to conduct qualitative content analysis of 84 media articles reporting on coronavirus related anti-Asian incidents. We also present the emerging psychological framework of race-based stress and trauma to conceptualize the psychological impact of these race-based incidents reported in the media. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis revealed five primary themes: (a) pathologizing cultural practices; (b) alien in one's own land; (c) invalidation of interethnic differences; (d) ascription of diseased status; and (e) duality of frontline hero and virus carrier. We provide examples for each of these themes. CONCLUSION: These themes document stigmatizing narratives and demonstrate the phenomenology of race-based stress and trauma experienced by Asian individuals during the COVID era.

Using specific methodologies for paired FST, AMOVA, mismatch, demographic-spatial expansion, molecular diversity and for the time of evolutionary divergence, it was possible to notice that only 79 sites remained conserved and that the high number of polymorphisms found helped to establish a clear pattern of genetic non-structuring, based on the time of divergence between the groups. The analyses also showed that significant evolutionary divergences within and between the five countries corroborate the fact that possible rapid and silent mutations are responsible for the increase in genetic variability of the Virus, a fact that would hinder the work with molecular targets for vaccines and medications in general.","Ramos, R. d.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective, longitudinal evaluation of repatriated travelers where the outcome of interest was a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. Travelers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were isolated in hospitals or at home under county isolation orders and underwent serial testing by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approximately every other day, as contemporaneous US guidance required two consecutive negative tests collected greater than or equal to 24 hours apart and symptom improvement before release from isolation. Results: Among quarantined repatriated travelers, 14% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. One-fifth of infected travelers initially tested negative but were identified on subsequent testing. All infected travelers remained asymptomatic or developed mild symptoms during isolation. Many travelers remained in prolonged isolation because of persistent viral detection based on contemporaneous policies. Conclusion: Our findings support testing within 3-5 days after possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure to comprehensively identify infections and mitigate transmission and lend support to symptom- and time-based isolation recommendations, rather than test-based criteria.","Waltenburg, M.

648178,A Framework-Based Approach to Assessing Mental Health Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children and Adolescents,2021-05-13,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, mental health among youth has been negatively impacted. Youth with a history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), as well as youth from minoritized racial-ethnic backgrounds, may be especially vulnerable to experiencing COVID-19-related distress. The current aims are to examine whether exposure to pre-pandemic ACEs predicts mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in youth and whether racial-ethnic background moderated these effects. METHODS: From May to August 2020, 7,983 youth (M(age)= 12.5, range= 10.6-14.6 years old) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study(SM) (ABCD Study®) completed at least one of three online surveys measuring the impact of the pandemic on their mental health. Data was evaluated in relation to youth’s pre-pandemic mental health and ACEs. RESULTS: Pre-pandemic ACE history significantly predicted poorer mental health (across all outcomes) and greater COVID-19-related stress and impact of fears on well-being. Youth reported improved mental health during the pandemic (from May to August 2020). While reporting similar levels of mental health, youth from minoritized racial-ethnic backgrounds had elevated COVID-19-related worry, stress, and impact on well-being. Race and ethnicity generally did not moderate ACE effects. Older youth, girls, and those with greater pre-pandemic internalizing symptoms also reported greater mental health symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Youth who experienced greater childhood adversity reported greater negative affect and COVID-19-related distress during the pandemic. Although they reported generally better mood, Black, Asian American, and multiracial youth reported greater COVID-19-related worry and experienced COVID-19 related discrimination compared to non-Hispanic White youth, highlighting potential health disparities.","Stinson, Elizabeth A.; Sullivan, Ryan M.; Peteet, Bridgette J.; Tapert, Susan F.; Baker, Fiona C.; Breslin, Florence J.; Dick, Anthony S.; Gonzalez, Marybel Robledo; Guillaume, Mathieu; Marshall, Andrew T.; McCabe, Connor J.; Pelham, William E.; Van Rinsveld, Amandine M.; Sheth, Chandni S.; Sowell, Elizabeth R.; Wade, Natasha E.; Wallace, Alexander L.; Lisdahl, Krista M.",Biol Psychiatry Glob Open Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34608463/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667174321001117; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsgos.2021.08.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667174321001117?v=s5,130

METHODS: Data on the demographic characteristics and clinical findings of the patients admitted at the First Hospital of Changsha from January 1, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were assessed. RESULTS: In this study, there were 8 (3.8%) asymptomatic, 21 (10.0%) mild upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and 180 (86.1%) pneumonia cases. In total, 47 (22.5%) patients resided in Wuhan, and 45 (21.5%) had recently traveled to Wuhan before disease onset. Moreover, 19 (9.1%) had contact with people from Wuhan, and 69 (33.0%) were family cluster cases. The median incubation period was approximately 6.3 (range: 1.0–20.0) days. Fever and cough were the most common initial symptoms: 99 (49.3%) patients presented with fever, without cough; 59 (29.4%) with cough, without fever; and 33 (16.4%) with both fever and cough. CONCLUSION: The symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were relatively mild outside Wuhan, and family cluster was a remarkable epidemic characteristic.

649592,Mental health and COVID-19: change the conversation,2020-05-04,"Study Objective: Acute infection with COVID-19 is associated with a wide variety of symptoms and a range of clinical severity from benign to life-threatening. Certain ED presenting symptoms may be associated with either a severe or a benign outcome. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of initial clinical symptoms with need for hospitalization, intensive care or death in ED patients within 30 days after presenting with acute symptomatic COVID-19. Methods: This study is a retrospective case-series of patients presenting to a single ED with acute symptomatic COVID-19 from March 7–August 9, 2020. Symptomatic patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible for this study. Patients who tested positively for COVID-19 due to screening tests but had no reasonably associated symptoms were excluded. Structured chart review was performed, and participants were analyzed by three categories representative of clinical severity: intensive care unit (ICU) care/death, general ward admission, and ED discharge /convalescence at home. Outcomes were ascertained 30 days after initial presentation to account for escalation in severity after the ED visit. We conducted univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses to report odds ratios and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) between hospital or ICU care/death versus convalescence at home and between ICU care/death versus general ward admission. Multivariable models were developed using stepwise selection in logistic regression. Results: In total, 994 patients were included in the study, of which, 551 (55.4%) patients convalesced at home, 314 (31.6%) patients required general ward admission, and 129 (13.0%) required ICU care or died. In the adjusted models, ED patients requiring hospital admission were more likely to be aged ≥ 65 years (aOR 7.4, 95% CI: 5.0, 10.8), Black/African American (aOR 3.0, 95% CI: 1.6, 5.8) or Asian/American Indian/Alaska Native/Other (aOR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1, 4.3), and experience dyspnea (aOR 2.7, 95% CI: 2.0, 3.7) or diarrhea (aOR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.2). However, they were less likely to experience sore throat (aOR 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2, 0.6), myalgia (aOR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.4, 0.7), headache (aOR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.4, 0.8), or olfactory/taste disturbance (aOR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3, 0.8). ED patients who required ICU care or died were more likely to experience altered mental status (aOR 3.8, 95% CI: 2.1, 6.6), but were less likely to report history of fever (0.5, 95% CI: 0.3, 0.8). Conclusions: In ED patients with acute COVID-19, complaints of sore throat, myalgias, headache or smell/taste disturbances were associated with discharge and convalescence at home. Patients who were ≥ age 65, Black/African American, experiencing dyspnea, diarrhea, or altered mental status were more likely to undergo hospital admission. Among all admitted patients, altered mental status was positively associated with ICU care or death, and a history of fever was negatively associated with ICU care or death.

A sucrose wet mount test and a lateral immunochromatography test were evaluated for epidemiological sensitivity and specificity, cost per test, simplicity, test time and ease of batching. Polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) of the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene locus, with gel electrophoresis, was used as a gold standard. Cohen's kappa statistic of agreement (к) between the Ontario Veterinary College (OVC) sucrose wet mount test and COWP PCR–RFLP was 0.82, and the sensitivity and specificity of the OVC sucrose wet mount test were 88.6% and 93.8%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the lateral immunochromatography test were 78.3% and 93.3%, respectively, and agreement between this test and PCR–RFLP was good (к = 0.73). There was substantial agreement between the OVC sucrose wet mount test and the lateral immunochromatography test (к = 0.84). Both tests were inexpensive and easy to use; however, the lateral immunochromatography test was faster and simpler to perform than the sucrose wet mount test, and was generally more user-friendly. These tests provide practitioners and researchers with cheap, quick and accurate methods of detecting C. parvum infection in young calves.","Trotz-Williams, Lise A.; Martin, S.

However, no consensus has been reached about how the meteorological conditions modulate the virus transmission as it is constrained more often by non-meteorological factors. Here, we find that the non-meteorological factors constrain statistically-least the growth rate of cumulative confirmed cases in a country when the cases arrive around 2500-3000. The least-constrained growth rate correlates with the near-surface ultraviolet flux and temperature significantly (correlation coefficients r=-0.55{+/-}0.08 and -0.45{+/-}0.08 at p 10-5, respectively). In response to increases of 1W/m2 ultraviolet and 1{degrees}C temperature, the growth rate decreases by 0.33{+/-}.11% and 0.18{+/-}.08% per day, respectively. The response to the ultraviolet flux exhibits a delay by about 7 days, providing an independent measure of the incubation period.

The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), the nation’s most comprehensive registry of suicide mortality, has qualitative text narratives that describe salient circumstances of these deaths. These texts have great potential for providing novel insights about suicide risk but may be subject to information bias. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between decedent characteristics and the presence and length of NVDRS text narratives (separately for coroner/medical examiner (C/ME) and law enforcement (LE) reports) among 233,108 suicide and undetermined deaths from 2003–2017. METHODS: Generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic and quasi-Poisson modeling was used to examine variation in the narratives (proportion of missing texts and character length of the non-missing texts, respectively) as a function of decedent age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, military history, and homeless status. Models adjusted for site, year, location of death, and autopsy status. RESULTS: The frequency of missing narratives was higher for LE vs. C/ME texts (19.8% vs. 5.2%). Decedent characteristics were not consistently associated with missing text across the two types of narratives (i.e., Black decedents were more likely to be missing the LE narrative but less likely to be missing the C/ME narrative relative to non-Hispanic whites). Conditional on having a narrative, C/ME were significantly longer than LE (822.44 vs. 780.68 characters). Decedents who were older, male, had less education and some racial/ethnic minority groups had shorter narratives (both C/ME and LE) than younger, female, more educated, and non-Hispanic white decedents. CONCLUSION: Decedent characteristics are significantly related to the presence and length of narrative texts for suicide and undetermined deaths in the NVDRS. Findings can inform future research using these data to identify novel determinants of suicide mortality.","Mezuk, Briana; Kalesnikava, Viktoryia A.; Kim, Jenni; Ko, Tomohiro M.; Collins, Cassady",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34270588/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254417,130

Here, by treating multiple individual adipose stem cell-derived adipocytes and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes with the potent GC dexamethasone (Dex), we uncovered cell-type-specific and individual-specific GC-dependent transcriptomes and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) cistromes. Individual-specific GR binding could be traced to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that altered the binding motifs of GR or its cooperating factors. We also discovered another set of genetic variants that modulated Dex response through affecting chromatin accessibility or chromatin architecture. Several SNPs that altered Dex-regulated GR binding and gene expression controlled Dex-driven metabolic perturbations. Remarkably, these genetic variations were highly associated with increases in serum glucose, lipids, and body mass in subjects on GC therapy. Knowledge of the genetic variants that predispose individuals to metabolic side effects allows for a precision medicine approach to the use of clinically relevant GCs.","Hu, Wenxiang; Jiang, Chunjie; Kim, Mindy; Yang, Wenjian; Zhu, Kun; Guan, Dongyin; Lv, Wenjian; Xiao, Yang; Wilson, Jessica R; Rader, Daniel J; Pui, Ching-Hon; Relling, Mary V; Lazar, Mitchell A",Cell Metab,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2021.06.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34233159/,130

It is known that the separation performance of pure polymers may significantly be improved by the dispersion of suitable filler materials in the polymer matrix, to produce so-called mixed matrix membranes. In the present work, four different organic cages were dispersed in the poly(ether ether ketone) with cardo group, PEEK-WC. The m-xylyl imine and furanyl imine-based fillers yielded mechanically robust and selective films after silicone coating. Instead, poor dispersion of p-xylyl imine and diphenyl imine cages did not allow the formation of selective films. The H2, He, O2, N2, CH4, and CO2 pure gas permeability of the neat polymer and the MMMs were measured, and the effect of filler was compared with the maximum limits expected for infinitely permeable and impermeable fillers, according to the Maxwell model. Time lag measurements allowed the calculation of the diffusion coefficient and demonstrated that 20 wt % of furanyl imine cage strongly increased the diffusion coefficient of the bulkier gases and decreased the diffusion selectivity, whereas the m-xylyl imine cage slightly increased the diffusion coefficient and improved the size-selectivity. The performance and properties of the membranes were discussed in relation to their composition and morphology.","Monteleone, Marcello; Mobili, Riccardo; Milanese, Chiara; Esposito, Elisa; Fuoco, Alessio; La Cognata, Sonia; Amendola, Valeria; Jansen, Johannes C",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577026/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26185557,130

655430,Editorial Perspective: A plea for the sustained implementation of digital interventions for young people with mental health problems in the light of the COVID‐19 pandemic,2020-09-14,"To date, there are limited data regarding manifestations of new coronavirus infection in infants born of SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, so the aim of this study is to investigate somatic and metabolic status of newborn infants born to mothers diagnosed with COVID-19. The investigation was carried out on the bases of Laboratory Diagnostic Department of Samara Regional Clinical Hospital named after V.D. Seredavin and the Department of Fundamental and Clinical Biochemistry with Laboratory Diagnostics of Samara State Medical University. Under observation were 85 newborns, including 35 born of healthy mothers and 50 born of COVID-19 mothers.The somatic status of all newborns was assessed using the Apgar scale at the 1st and 5th minutes after birth. Also all newborns had general and biochemical blood tests and newborns from mothers with COVID-19 were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in oral and nasopharyngeal swabs. Thus, the study of somatic status revealed that of 50 neonates from women infected with COVID-19, only 18% were practically healthy, the rest had signs of prematurity, hypotrophy, perinatal CNS damage, diabetic fetopathy, pulmonary atelectasis, delayed intrauterine development, asphyxia. The metabolic state is characterised by decreased haemoglobin and platelets, increased concentration of total protein, including C-reactive protein, high transaminase activity, decreased sodium and chloride content. These parameters of general and biochemical blood tests can be considered as indicators for the evaluation of the condition of newborns from mothers with COVID-19.","Borodina, I A; Gil'miyarova, F N; Gusyakova, O A; Selezneva, I A; Borisova, O V; Potyakina, E E; Kolot'eva, N A; Kozlov, A V; Gorbacheva, I V; Kuznecova, O Yu; Baldina, O A; Vinogradova, L N; Emel'yanova, N G; Koroteeva, Yu A",Klinicheskaia laboratornaia diagnostika,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34388314/; https://doi.org/10.51620/0869-2084-2021-66-8-453-458,130

Therefore, development of supplements that target APOE genotype-modulated processes could provide a great benefit for the aging population. Evidence suggests a link between APOE genotype and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); however, clinical studies with current DHA supplements have produced negative results in dementia. The lack of beneficial effects with current DHA supplements may be related to limited bioavailability, as the optimal form of DHA for brain uptake is lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-DHA. We previously developed a method to enrich the LPC-DHA content of krill oil through lipase treatment (LT-krill oil), which resulted in fivefold higher enrichment in brain DHA levels in wild-type mice compared with untreated krill oil. Here, we evaluated the effect of a control diet, diet containing krill oil, or a diet containing LT-krill oil in APOE3- and APOE4-targeted replacement mice (APOE-TR mice; treated from 4 to 12 months of age). We found that DHA levels in the plasma and hippocampus are lower in APOE4-TR mice and that LT-krill oil increased DHA levels in the plasma and hippocampus of both APOE3- and APOE4-TR mice. In APOE4-TR mice, LT-krill oil treatment resulted in higher levels of the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A and improved performance on the novel object recognition test. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that LPC-DHA/EPA-enriched krill oil can increase brain DHA and improve memory-relevant behavior in mice that express APOE4. Therefore, long-term use of LT-krill oil supplements may on some level protect against age-related neurodegeneration.","Scheinman, Sarah B.; Sugasini, Dhavamani; Zayed, Monay; Yalagala, Poorna C.

655600,"Identifying Barriers to Healthcare Access for New Immigrants: A Qualitative Study in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada",2021-08-23,"BACKGROUND: In experimental studies viral infections have been shown to induce type 2 inflammation in asthmatics, but whether this is a feature of naturally occurring virus-induced asthma exacerbations is unknown. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) released from the airway epithelium in response to damage, has been suggested as a link between viral infection and type 2 inflammation, but the role of TSLP in asthma exacerbations is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether type 2 inflammation, as measured by sputum eosinophils and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), is a feature of naturally occurring virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and whether TSLP is associated with this type 2 inflammation. METHODS: Patients presenting to hospital with acute asthma were examined during the exacerbation, and after 4 weeks recovery. The assessments included spirometry, FeNO and induced sputum for differential counts and TSLP mRNA levels. Nasal swabs were collected for viral detection. RESULTS: Sputum eosinophils and FeNO were similar between virus-positive (n=44) and negative patients (n=44). In virus-positive patients, TSLP expression was lower at exacerbation than follow-up (p=0.03). High TSLP at exacerbation was associated with lower sputum eosinophils (p=0.01) and higher FEV1 (p=0.03). In virus-positive patients, %-predicted FEV1 negatively correlated with both FeNO and sputum eosinophils (p=0.02 and p=0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our findings support that type 2 inflammation is present in patients during virus-induced asthma exacerbations, to the same degree as non-viral exacerbations, and correlate negatively with FEV1. However, in virus-positive patients, high TSLP expression during exacerbation was associated with low sputum eosinophils, suggesting that the effect of TSLP in vivo, in the setting of an asthma exacerbation, might be different than the type 2 inducing effects observed in experimental studies.","Bjerregaard, Asger; Laing, Ingrid A.; Poulsen, Nadia; Backer, Vibeke; Sverrild, Asger; Fally, Markus; Khoo, Siew-Kim; Barrett, Lucy; Baltic, Svetlana; Thompson, Philip J.; Chidlow, Glenys; Sikazwe, Chisha; Smith, David W; Bochkov, Yury A.; Le Souëf, Peter; Porsbjerg, Celeste",Respiratory Medicine,http://www.resmedjournal.com/article/S0954611116303389/pdf; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611116303389; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2016.12.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611116303389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28137494/,130

Understanding the effect of BTKi's on humoral immunity is timely because BTKi's are widely used and vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 is urgently needed. In 2 open-label, single-arm clinical trials, we measured the effect of BTKi's on de novo immune response against recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (HepB-CpG) and recall response against recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in CLL patients who were TN or on BTKi. The primary end point was serologic response to HepB-CpG (anti-hepatitis B surface antibodies ≥10 mIU/mL) and RZV (≥fourfold increase in anti-glycoprotein E). The response rate to HepB-CpG was lower in patients on BTKi (3.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-18.9) than patients who were TN (28.1%; 95% CI, 15.6-45.4; P = .017).

656631,Trends in the recording of anxiety in UK primary care: a multi-method approach,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND: Phylogenies of rapidly evolving pathogens can be difficult to resolve because of the small number of substitutions that accumulate in the short times since divergence. To improve resolution of such phylogenies we propose using insertion and deletion (indel) information in addition to substitution information. We accomplish this through joint estimation of alignment and phylogeny in a Bayesian framework, drawing inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Joint estimation of alignment and phylogeny sidesteps biases that stem from conditioning on a single alignment by taking into account the ensemble of near-optimal alignments. RESULTS: We introduce a novel Markov chain transition kernel that improves computational efficiency by proposing non-local topology rearrangements and by block sampling alignment and topology parameters. In addition, we extend our previous indel model to increase biological realism by placing indels preferentially on longer branches. We demonstrate the ability of indel information to increase phylogenetic resolution in examples drawn from within-host viral sequence samples. We also demonstrate the importance of taking alignment uncertainty into account when using such information. Finally, we show that codon-based substitution models can significantly affect alignment quality and phylogenetic inference by unrealistically forcing indels to begin and end between codons. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that indel information can improve phylogenetic resolution of recently diverged pathogens and that alignment uncertainty should be considered in such analyses.","Redelings, Benjamin D; Suchard, Marc A",BMC Evol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17359539/,130

Many internal medicine (IM) subspecialty fellowship programs hosted virtual interviews for the first time with little published data to guide best practices. To evaluate how IM subspecialty fellowship applicants perceived the virtual interview day experience. We designed a 38-item questionnaire that was sent via email to applicants in eight IM subspecialty programs at a single tertiary academic medical center (University of California, San Francisco) from September–November, 2020. Seventy-five applicants completed the survey (75/244, 30.7%), including applicants from all eight fellowship programs. Most survey respondents agreed that the length of the virtual interview day (mean = 6.4 hours) was long enough to gather the information they needed (n = 65, 86.7%) and short enough to prevent fatigue (n = 55, 73.3%). Almost all survey respondents agreed that they could adequately assess the clinical experience (n = 71, 97.3%), research opportunities (n = 72, 98.6%), and program culture (n = 68, 93.2%).

The hybridomas produce monoclonal antibodies that recognize viral component molecules, including the spike protein (S) and the nucleocapsid protein (N), enabling the immunological detection of SARS-CoV by immunofluorescence staining, immunoblot, or an antigen-capture ELISA system.

659940,The critical importance in identifying the biological mechanisms underlying the effects of racism on mental health,2020-08-13,"SARS-CoV-2 mainly invades respiratory epithelial cells by adhesion to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and thus, infected patients may develop mild to severe inflammatory responses and acute lung injury. Afferent impulses that result from the stimulation of pulmonary mechano-chemoreceptors, peripheral and central chemoreceptors by inflammatory cytokines are conducted to the brainstem. Integration and processing of these input signals occur within the central nervous system, especially in the limbic system and sensorimotor cortex, and importantly feedback regulation exists between O(2), CO(2,) and blood pH. Despite the intensity of hypoxemia in COVID-19, the intensity of dyspnea sensation is inappropriate to the degree of hypoxemia in some patients (silent hypoxemia). We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 may cause neuronal damage in the corticolimbic network and subsequently alter the perception of dyspnea and the control of respiration. SARS-CoV-2 neuronal infection may change the secretion of numerous endogenous neuropeptides or neurotransmitters that distribute through large areas of the nervous system to produce cellular and perceptual effects. SARS-CoV-2 mainly enter to CNS via direct (neuronal and hematologic route) and indirect route. We theorize that SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced neuronal cell damage and may change the balance of endogenous neuropeptides or neurotransmitters that distribute through large areas of the nervous system to produce cellular and perceptual effects. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-associated neuronal damage may influence the control of respiration by interacting in neuromodulation. This would open up possible lines of study for the progress in the central mechanism of COVID-19-induced hypoxia. Future research is desirable to confirm or disprove such a hypothesis.","Nouri-Vaskeh, Masoud; Sharifi, Ali; Khalili, Neda; Zand, Ramin; Sharifi, Akbar",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303846720305606?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303846720305606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32947193/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2020.106217,130

This travel restriction order led to a significant reduction in traffic volumes and a generally lower exposure to crashes. However, recent preliminary statistics in the US suggest an increase in fatal crashes over the period of lockdown in comparison to the same period in previous years. This study sought to investigate how the pandemic affected road crashes and crash outcomes in Alabama. Daily vehicle miles traveled and crashes were obtained and explored. To understand the factors associated with crash outcomes, four crash-severity models were developed: (1) Single-vehicle (SV) crashes prior to lockdown order (Normal times SV); (2) multi-vehicle (MV) crashes prior to lockdown order (Normal times MV); (3) Single-vehicle crashes after lockdown order (COVID times SV); and (4) Multi-vehicle crashes after lockdown order (COVID times MV). The models were developed using the first 28 weeks of crashes recorded in 2020. The findings of the study reveal that although traffic volumes and vehicle miles traveled had significantly dropped during the lockdown, there was an increase in the total number of crashes and major injury crashes compared to the period prior to the lockdown order, with speeding, DUI, and weekends accounting for a significant proportion of these crashes. These observations provide useful lessons for road safety improvements during extreme events that may require statewide lockdown, as has been done with the COVID-19 pandemic. Traffic management around shopping areas and other areas that may experience increased traffic volumes provide opportunities for road safety stakeholders to reduce the occurrence of crashes in the weeks leading to an announcement of any future statewide or local lockdowns. Additionally, increased law enforcement efforts can help to reduce risky driving activities as traffic volumes decrease.","Adanu, Emmanuel Kofi; Brown, David; Jones, Steven; Parrish, Allen",Accid Anal Prev,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457521004590; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001457521004590; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34649013/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2021.106428,130

Additionally, technology must be more available in order to gain a better understanding of the factors that condition the presence of mosquitoes in residential settings. This study is the first to report on the use of drones for mosquito breeding surveillance in Mexico and aims to evaluate the effectiveness of low-cost drone images in order to identify Aedes aegypti mosquito breeding sites on the roofs of buildings and backyards. The results were compared to the current government Aedes vector surveillance program, which is based on on-ground activities in Tapachula city, Chiapas, southern Mexico. Through drone surveillance, we identified a total of 983 containers that were distributed in 10 types; approximately one-third (2752) of the containers were inspected by ground surveillance systems that were distributed in 26 container types. The concordance between drone and ground surveillance was 64.9% in detecting at least one container using both methods. Drones can identify the most common roof containers and should be used in dengue-endemic areas that have many possible breeding sites and are in accessible housing areas. Drones can be useful in complementing mosquito surveillance and control programs. ABSTRACT: Aedes aegypti control programs require more sensitive tools in order to survey domestic and peridomestic larval habitats for dengue and other arbovirus prevention areas. As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, field technicians have faced a new occupational hazard during their work activities in dengue surveillance and control. Safer strategies to monitor larval populations, in addition to minimum householder contact, are undoubtedly urgently needed. Drones can be part of the solution in urban and rural areas that are dengue-endemic. Throughout this study, the proportion of larvae breeding sites found in the roofs and backyards of houses were assessed using drone images. Concurrently, the traditional ground field technician’s surveillance was utilized to sample the same house groups. The results were analyzed in order to compare the effectiveness of both field surveillance approaches. Aerial images of 216 houses from El Vergel village in Tapachula, Chiapas, Mexico, at a height of 30 m, were obtained using a drone. Each household was sampled indoors and outdoors by vector control personnel targeting all the containers that potentially served as Aedes aegypti breeding sites. The main results were that the drone could find 1 container per 2.8 found by ground surveillance; however, containers that were inaccessible by technicians in roofs and backyards, such as plastic buckets and tubs, disposable plastic containers and flowerpots were more often detected by drones than traditional ground surveillance. This new technological approach would undoubtedly improve the surveillance of Aedes aegypti in household environments, and better vector control activities would therefore be achieved in dengue-endemic countries.","Valdez-Delgado, Kenia Mayela; Moo-Llanes, David A.; Danis-Lozano, Rogelio; Cisneros-Vázquez, Luis Alberto; Flores-Suarez, Adriana E.; Ponce-García, Gustavo; Medina-De la Garza, Carlos E.; Díaz-González, Esteban E.; Fernández-Salas, Ildefonso",Insects,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442229/; https://doi.org/10.3390/insects12080663,130

To study the epidemiology of FCoV in Taiwan, 81 FIP-suspected sick cats with effusive specimens were recruited to test for FCoV infection using immunofluorescence staining and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction as detection methods, and viral RNAs were recovered from the specimens to conduct genotyping and phylogenetic analysis based on the spike (S) protein gene. The results revealed that a total of 47 (47/81, 58%) of the sick cats were positive for FCoV in the effusion samples, of which 39 were successfully sequenced and comprised of 21 type I strains, 9 type II strains, and 9 co-infections. The signalment analysis of these sick cats revealed that only the sex of cats showed a significant association (odds ratio = 2.74, 95% confidence interval = 1.06–7.07, p = 0.03) with the infection of FCoV, while age and breed showed no association. FCoV-positive cats demonstrated a significantly lower albumin to globulin ratio than negative individuals (p = 0.0004). The partial S gene-based phylogenetic analysis revealed that the type I strains demonstrated genetic diversity forming several clades, while the type II strains were more conserved. This study demonstrates the latest epidemiological status of FCoV infection in the northern part of Taiwan among sick cats and presents comparisons of Taiwan and other countries.","Luo, Yi-Chen; Liu, I-Li; Chen, Yu-Tan; Chen, Hui-Wen",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854379/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9090698,130

This analysis employs social media listening and analysis to discern top themes arising from social and online media posts referencing veterinarians. Social media sentiment analysis is also employed to aid in quantifying the search results, in terms of whether they are positivity/negativity associated. From September 2017-November 2019, over 1.4 million posts and 1.7 million mentions were analyzed; the top domain in the search results was Twitter (74%). The mean net sentiment associated with the search conducted over the time period studied was 52%. The top terms revealed in the searches conducted revolved mainly around care of or concern for pet animals. The recognition of challenges facing the veterinary medicine profession were notably absent, except for the mention of suicide risks. While undeniably influenced by the search terms selected, which were directed towards client–clinic related verbiage, a relative lack of knowledge regarding veterinarians’ roles in human health, food safety/security, and society generally outside of companion animal care was recognized.

665200,MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS IN QUARANTINED INTERNATIONAL AIR PASSENGERS DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC – AN EXPERIENTIAL ACCOUNT,2020-08-25,"A recently developed pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 bursting in Wuhan, China, has quickly spread across the world. We report the clinical characteristics of 82 cases of death from COVID-19 in a single center. Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital’s electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and a large proportion of them were diagnosed with severe illness when admitted. Due to the overwhelming of our system, a total of 14 patients (17.1%) were treated in the ICU, 83% of deaths never received Critical Care Support, only 40% had mechanical ventilation support despite 100% needing oxygen and the leading cause of death being pulmonary. Most of the patients who died were male (65.9%). More than half of the patients who died were older than 60 years (80.5%), and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of the patients who died had comorbidities (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), followed by sepsis/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhagic, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of >5 (94.5%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of >500 (89.2%), and increased C-reactive protein (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D-dimer (97.1%) levels. A high level of IL-6 (>10 pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients. The median time from initial symptoms to death was 15 days (IQR 11–20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p = 0.037) and time from initial symptoms to death was remarkably observed. Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease and even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but the virus itself and cytokine release syndrome-mediated damage to other organs, including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhagic damage, should be taken seriously as well.","Zhang, Bicheng; Zhou, Xiaoyang; Qiu, Yanru; Song, Yuxiao; Feng, Fan; Feng, Jia; Song, Qibin; Jia, Qingzhu; Wang, Jun",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235458; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645044/,130

666016,Physical activity and mental well-being under COVID-19 lockdown: a cross-sectional multination study,2021-05-27,"BACKGROUND: A previous efficacy trial found benefit from inhaled budesonide for COVID-19 in patients not admitted to hospital, but effectiveness in high-risk individuals is unknown. We aimed to establish whether inhaled budesonide reduces time to recovery and COVID-19-related hospital admissions or deaths among people at high risk of complications in the community. METHODS: PRINCIPLE is a multicentre, open-label, multi-arm, randomised, controlled, adaptive platform trial done remotely from a central trial site and at primary care centres in the UK. Eligible participants were aged 65 years or older or 50 years or older with comorbidities, and unwell for up to 14 days with suspected COVID-19 but not admitted to hospital. Participants were randomly assigned to usual care, usual care plus inhaled budesonide (800 μg twice daily for 14 days), or usual care plus other interventions, and followed up for 28 days. Participants were aware of group assignment. The coprimary endpoints are time to first self-reported recovery and hospital admission or death related to COVID-19, within 28 days, analysed using Bayesian models. The primary analysis population included all eligible SARS-CoV-2-positive participants randomly assigned to budesonide, usual care, and other interventions, from the start of the platform trial until the budesonide group was closed. This trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN86534580) and is ongoing. FINDINGS: The trial began enrolment on April 2, 2020, with randomisation to budesonide from Nov 27, 2020, until March 31, 2021, when the prespecified time to recovery superiority criterion was met. 4700 participants were randomly assigned to budesonide (n=1073), usual care alone (n=1988), or other treatments (n=1639). The primary analysis model includes 2530 SARS-CoV-2-positive participants, with 787 in the budesonide group, 1069 in the usual care group, and 974 receiving other treatments. There was a benefit in time to first self-reported recovery of an estimated 2·94 days (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] 1·19 to 5·12) in the budesonide group versus the usual care group (11·8 days [95% BCI 10·0 to 14·1] vs 14·7 days [12·3 to 18·0]; hazard ratio 1·21 [95% BCI 1·08 to 1·36]), with a probability of superiority greater than 0·999, meeting the prespecified superiority threshold of 0·99. For the hospital admission or death outcome, the estimated rate was 6·8% (95% BCI 4·1 to 10·2) in the budesonide group versus 8·8% (5·5 to 12·7) in the usual care group (estimated absolute difference 2·0% [95% BCI –0·2 to 4·5]; odds ratio 0·75 [95% BCI 0·55 to 1·03]), with a probability of superiority 0·963, below the prespecified superiority threshold of 0·975. Two participants in the budesonide group and four in the usual care group had serious adverse events (hospital admissions unrelated to COVID-19). INTERPRETATION: Inhaled budesonide improves time to recovery, with a chance of also reducing hospital admissions or deaths (although our results did not meet the superiority threshold), in people with COVID-19 in the community who are at higher risk of complications.

666221,Households access to improved drinking water sources and toilet facilities in Ethiopia: a multilevel analysis based on 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey,2021-03-18,"Recent advances in CRISPR-based diagnostics suggest that DETECTR, a combination of isothermal reverse transcriptase loop mediated amplification (RT-LAMP) and subsequent Cas12 bystander nuclease activation by amplicon targeting ribonucleoprotein complexes, could be a faster and cheaper alternative to qRT-PCR without sacrificing sensitivity/specificity. Here we compare DETECTR with qRT-PCR to diagnose COVID-19 on 378 patient samples. Patient sample dilution assays suggest a higher analytical sensitivity of DETECTR compared to qRT-PCR, however, this was not confirmed in this large patient cohort, were we report 95% reproducibility between the two tests. These data showed that both techniques are equally sensitive in detecting SARS-CoV-2 providing additional value of DETECTR to the currently used qRT-PCR platforms. For DETECTR, different gRNAs can be used simultaneously to obviate negative results due to mutations in N-gene. Lateral flow strips, suitable as a point of care test (POCT), showed a 100% correlation to the high-throughput DETECTR assay. Importantly, DETECTR was 100% specific for SARS-CoV-2 relative to other human coronaviruses. As there is no need for specialized equipment, DETECTR could be rapidly implemented as a complementary technically independent approach to qRT-PCR thereby increasing the testing capacity of medical microbiological laboratories and relieving the existent PCR-platforms for routine non-SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing.","Brandsma, Eelke; Verhagen, Han J M P; van de Laar, Thijs J W; Claas, Eric C J; Cornelissen, Marion; van den Akker, Emile",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33038252/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa641,130

ARDS occurs most often in the setting of pneumonia, sepsis, aspiration of gastric contents or severe trauma, and is present in ~10% of all intensive care unit patients worldwide. Despite some improvements over the past decades, mortality remains high at 30–40% in most studies. Pathologic specimens from patients with ARDS most frequently reveal diffuse alveolar damage, and laboratory studies have demonstrated both alveolar epithelial and lung endothelial injury, resulting in accumulation of protein-rich inflammatory edema fluid in the alveolar space. Diagnosis is based on consensus syndromic criteria, with recent proposed modifications for under-resourced settings and for pediatric patients. Patient management focuses on implementing a lung-protective ventilation strategy; no specific pharmacotherapies have been identified. Long-term outcomes of patients with ARDS are increasingly recognized as important research targets, as many patients survive ARDS only to suffer ongoing functional and/or psychologic sequelae. Future directions include efforts to facilitate earlier recognition of ARDS, prognostic and/or predictive enrichment in clinical studies to identify responsive subsets, and ongoing efforts to understand fundamental mechanisms of lung injury that may respond to specific treatments.","Matthay, Michael A.; Zemans, Rachel L.; Zimmerman, Guy A.; Arabi, Yaseen M.; Beitler, Jeremy R.; Mercat, Alain; Herridge, Margaret; Randolph, Adrienne G.; Calfee, Carolyn S.",Nature Reviews Disease Primers,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30872586/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41572-019-0069-0,130

Limited data was reported from Arabian Gulf countries on vaccine adverse effects. Objectives This study looked at the rate of reporting at least one side effect post-COVID-19 vaccination and its associated factors (sociodemographic characteristics, clinical condition, and type of vaccines). Additionally, questions about safety and willingness to recommend them were included. Study design Phone interviews on post-COVID-19 vaccination adverse effects were utilized to record responses related to reporting at least one side effect post vaccinations across the studied variables. Data collection continued for two months (from 1(st) March to 30(th) April 2021). Methodology Participants were adults (Omani citizens and non-citizens) who received AstraZeneca (AZ) or Pfizer (PF) vaccines from primary care facilities in Muscat and were randomly selected from the health information system. Responses were saved in a bespoke Google form/questionnaire. Chi-squared tests were utilized to determine potential factors associated with the dependent variable. Results A total of 753 participants completed the phone interviews. The mean age was 52 (3.5), males (54.1%), and 65.1% were Omanis. Hypertension (39.7%), diabetes (34.1%), and asthma (16.7%) were the commonest comorbidities. AZ and PF were administered to 78% and 22% of the participants. Of them, 49.8% reported at least one adverse effect post-COVID-19 vaccination. The proportion of participants with at least one adverse effect was significantly more in individuals who were younger, females, with more than secondary education, and employed (p value < 0.001, 0.01, <0.001, and <0.001, respectively). There was no severe reaction (anaphylactic shock) to the vaccines, and most adverse effects were mild-moderate. The proportion of individuals who reported adverse effects were higher with AZ vs PF (53% vs 38.6, p = 0.001). The most common reported localized adverse effects were pain and tenderness (28.3% and 12.1%). Fever and body aches were the commonly reported systemic adverse effects (33.5% and 29.2%). The safety of COVID-19 vaccines was well perceived, and most participants were willing to recommend them to others. Conclusions The current study confirms findings from existing literature on the mild to moderate adverse effects of AZ and PF vaccines. Despite the subjective nature of this study, it is reassuring that the studied COVID-19 vaccines can be administered safely. However, more longitudinal studies are needed to test their efficacy in disease prevention.","Al Ghafri, Thamra S; Al Balushi, Lamya; Al Balushi, Zainab; Al Hinai, Fatma; Al Hasani, Said; Anwar, Huda; Al Lawati, Muna; Al Harthi, Saud",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34522533/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17055,130

671123,Addressing the public mental health challenge of COVID-19,2020-06-09,"Parent-child conversations are important for children’s cognitive development, children’s ability to cope with stressful events, and can shape children’s beliefs about the causes of illness. In the context of a global pandemic, families have faced a multitude of challenges, including changes to their routines, that they need to convey to their children. Thus, parent-child conversations about the coronavirus pandemic might convey information about the causes of illness, but also about how and why it is necessary for children to modify their behaviors to comply with new social norms and medical guidance. The main goal of this study was to examine the questions children ask about the COVID-19 pandemic and how parents answer them. This survey included responses from a national sample of 349 predominantly white parents of children between the ages of 3 and 12 recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk in United States. Parents reported that although children asked about COVID-19 and its causes (17.3%), children asked primarily about lifestyle changes that occurred as a result of the pandemic (24.0%) and safety (18.4%). Parents reported answering these questions by emphasizing that the purpose of different preventative measures was to protect the child (11.8%) or the family (42.7%) and providing reassurance (13.3%). Many parents discussed how it was their social responsibility to slow the spread of the virus (38.4%). Parents of younger children tended to shield them from information about COVID-19 (p = .038), while parents with more knowledge were more likely to provide explanations (p < .001). Our analysis shows that families not only discuss information about the virus but also information about changes to their lifestyle, preventative measures, and social norms.","Menendez, David; Klapper, Rebecca E.; Golden, Michelle Z.; Mandel, Ava R.; Nicholas, Katrina A.; Schapfel, Maria H.; Silsby, Olivia O.; Sowers, Kailee A.; Sumanthiran, Dillanie; Welch, Victoria E.; Rosengren, Karl S.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34437619/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256692,130
671572,Corrigendum: Online Mental Health Survey in a Medical College in China During the COVID-19 Outbreak,2020-08-14,"BACKGROUND: Semliki Forest virus (SFV) has a positive strand RNA genome and infects different cells of vertebrates and invertebrates. The 5' two-thirds of the genome encodes non-structural proteins that are required for virus replication and synthesis of subgenomic (SG) mRNA for structural proteins. SG-mRNA is generated by internal initiation at the SG-promoter that is located at the complementary minus-strand template. Different types of expression systems including replication-competent vectors, which represent alphavirus genomes with inserted expression units, have been developed. The replication-competent vectors represent useful tools for studying alphaviruses and have potential therapeutic applications. In both cases, the properties of the vector, such as its genetic stability and expression level of the protein of interest, are important. RESULTS: We analysed 14 candidates of replication-competent vectors based on the genome of an SFV4 isolate that contained a duplicated SG promoter or an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-element controlled marker gene. It was found that the IRES elements and the minimal -21 to +5 SG promoter were non-functional in the context of these vectors. The efficient SG promoters contained at least 26 residues upstream of the start site of SG mRNA. The insertion site of the SG promoter and its length affected the genetic stability of the vectors, which was always higher when the SG promoter was inserted downstream of the coding region for structural proteins. The stability also depended on the conditions used for vector propagation. A procedure based on the in vitro transcription of ligation products was used for generation of replication-competent vector-based expression libraries that contained hundreds of thousands of different genomes, and maintained genetic diversity and the ability to express inserted genes over five passages in cell culture. CONCLUSION: The properties of replication-competent vectors of alphaviruses depend on the details of their construction.

The main factor for instability of SFV4-based replication-competent vectors was the deletion of genes of interest, since the resulting shorter genomes had a growth advantage over the original vector.","Rausalu, Kai; Iofik, Anna; Ülper, Liane; Karo-Astover, Liis; Lulla, Valeria; Merits, Andres",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19317912/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-6-33,130

Because of its harsh growth requirements, limited detection methods, and non-specific clinical manifestations, diagnosing Legionella pneumonia remains still challenging. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) technology has increased the rate of detection of Legionella. This study describes a patient who rapidly progressed to severe ARDS during the early stage of infection and was treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Although his bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was negative for infection and his serum was negative for anti-Legionella antibody, mNGS of his BALF and blood showed only the presence of Legionella pneumophila (blood mNGS reads 229, BALF reads 656). After antibiotic treatment and weaning from ECMO, however, he developed a secondary Aspergillus and Klebsiella pneumoniae infection as shown by mNGS. Mechanical ventilation and antibiotic treatment were effective. A search of PubMed showed few reports of secondary Aspergillus infections after Legionella infection. Severe pneumonia caused by any type of pathogenic bacteria may be followed by Aspergillus infection, sometimes during extremely early stages of infection. Patients with severe pneumonia caused by Legionella infection should undergo early screening for secondary infections using methods such as mNGS, enabling early and precise treatment, thereby simplifying the use of antibiotics and improving patient prognosis.","Yue, Ruiming; Wu, Xiaoxiao; Li, Tianlong; Chang, Li; Huang, Xiaobo; Pan, Lingai",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34277662/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.686512,130

METHODS: A single-centre retrospective observational study was conducted of all orthopaedic oncologic patients undergoing surgical evaluation from March to June 2020. Patients were prioritized as level 0-IV, 0 being elective and IV being emergent. Only priority levels 0 to III were included. Delay duration was measured in days and resulting morbidities were categorized into seven groups: prolonged pain/disability; unplanned preoperative radiation and/or chemotherapy; local tumour progression; increased systemic disease; missed opportunity for surgery due to progression of disease/lost to follow up; delay in diagnosis; and no morbidity. RESULTS: Overall, 25 patients met inclusion criteria. There were eight benign tumours, seven metastatic, seven primary sarcomas, one multiple myeloma, and two patients without a biopsy proven diagnosis. There was no priority level 0, two priority level I, six priority level II, and 17 priority level III cases. The mean duration of delay for priority level I was 114 days (84 to 143), priority level II was 88 days (63 to 133), and priority level III was 77 days (35 to 269). Prolonged pain/disability and delay in diagnosis, affecting 52% and 40%,respectively, represented the two most frequent morbidities. Local tumour progression and increased systemic disease affected 32% and 24% respectively. No patients tested positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 related delays in surgical management led to major morbidity in this studied orthopaedic oncologic patient population. By understanding these morbidities through clearer hindsight, a thoughtful approach can be developed to balance the risk of COVID-19 exposure versus delay in treatment, ensuring optimal care for orthopedic oncologic patients as the pandemic continues with intermittent calls for halting surgery.

Schools were tasked with providing remote instruction to students, and many of these children continued to require mental and behavioral health services provided by school psychologists. In this study, 675 school psychologists were surveyed across the United States to examine how their roles and responsibilities changed as a result of COVID‐19. Participants reported the perceived impact of COVID‐19 on students’ mental health and difficulty serving students and families, as well as their concerns and recommendations pertaining to school reentry. Overall, respondents in this study reported that their roles and responsibilities notably changed because of COVID‐19.

676190,Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Fellowship Program Website Content and Accessibility,2021-01-27,"In the early stage of virus infection, the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling pathway of the host cell is activated to induce interferon production, activating interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that encode antiviral proteins that exert antiviral effects. Viperin is one of the innate antiviral proteins that exert broad-spectrum antiviral effects by various mechanisms. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus that causes huge losses to the pig industry. Research on early antiviral responses in the gastrointestinal tract is essential for developing strategies to prevent the spread of PEDV. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of viperin in PEDV-infected IPEJ-C2 cells. Increased expression of interferon and viperin and decreased replication of PEDV with a clear reduction in the viral load were observed in PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells. Amino acids 1–50 of porcine viperin contain an endoplasmic reticulum signal sequence that allows viperin to be anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum and are necessary for its function in inhibiting PEDV proliferation. The interaction of the viperin S-adenosylmethionine domain with the N protein of PEDV was confirmed via confocal laser scanning microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation. This interaction might interfere with viral replication or assembly to reduce virus proliferation. Our results highlight a potential mechanism whereby viperin is able to inhibit PEDV replication and play an antiviral role in innate immunity.","Wu, Jiaqi; Chi, Heng; Fu, Yali; Cao, Aiping; Shi, Jingxuan; Zhu, Min; Zhang, Lilin; Hua, Deping; Huang, Jinhai",Arch Virol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-020-04747-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719955/,130

The threat the pandemic poses as well as associated lockdown measures created challenging times for many. This study aimed to investigate the individual and social factors associated with low mental health, particularly perceived threat and lockdown measures, and factors associated with psychological well-being, particularly sense of control. An online survey was completed by participants (N = 8,229) recruited from 79 countries. In line with pre-registered hypotheses, participants showed elevated levels of anxiety and depression worldwide. This poor mental health was predicted by perceived threat. The effect of threat on depression was further moderated by social isolation, but there was no effect of sense of control. Sense of control was low overall, and was predicted negatively by maladaptive coping, but positively by adaptive coping and the perception that the government is dealing with the outbreak. Social isolation increased with quarantine duration, but was mitigated by frequent communication with close ones. Engaging in individual actions to avoid contracting the virus was associated with higher anxiety, except when done professionally. We suggest that early lockdown of the pandemic may have had detrimental psychological effects, which may be alleviated by individual actions such as maintaining frequent social contact and adaptive coping, and by governmental actions which demonstrate support in a public health crisis. Citizens and governments can work together to adapt better to restrictive but necessary measures during the current and future pandemics.","van Mulukom, Valerie; Muzzulini, Barbara; Rutjens, Bastiaan T; van Lissa, Caspar J; Farias, Miguel",Transl Behav Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34155522/; https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibab072,130

This study aimed to explore whether the pandemic can provoke a teachable moment regarding lifestyle change in cardiovascular disease patients. Method: In this cross-sectional survey study, 830 cardiovascular disease patients reported their intentions to change lifestyle, instigated by the corona crisis, together with risk perception, affective impact, and changed self-concept, based on a “teachable moments” framework. Results: Between 8 and 28% of the sample reported increased intentions to optimize lifestyle behaviors, particularly related to general lifestyle (28%), physical activity (25%), and diet (21%). Multivariate regression analyses revealed that changed self-concept was associated with higher intentions to improve general lifestyle (B = 0.26; CI = 0.19–0.33), physical activity (B = 0.23; CI = 0.16–0.30), and smoking (B = 0.29; CI = 0.01–0.57). In addition, changed self-concept and affective impact were both significantly associated with higher intentions to improve diet (resp. B = 0.29; CI = 0.21–0.36 and B = 0.12; CI = 0.04–0.21) and to limit alcohol consumption (resp. B = 0.22; CI = 0.13–0.30 and B = 0.11; CI = 0.01–0.20). We did not find evidence for an important role of risk perception on behavior change intentions. Conclusion: The COVID-19 crisis evoked a potential teachable moment for lifestyle change in cardiovascular disease patients, driven by a change in a patient's self-concept and to a lesser extent by an affective impact of the COVID-19 crisis. These results suggest an important window of opportunity for healthcare professionals to utilize the pandemic to promote a healthy lifestyle to their patients.","Brust, Michelle; Gebhardt, Winifred A.; Numans, Mattijs E.; Kiefte-de Jong, Jessica C.",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34239483/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.678513,130

However, though the current increase of knowledge about the disease, there is still no effective treatment for the usage of drugs. Thus, we retrospectively assessed use and effects of therapeutic regimens in hospitalized patients on in-hospital mortality. METHODS: COVOCA is a retrospective observational cohort study on 18 COVID centres throughout Campania Region Hospitals. We included adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, discharged/dead between March/June 2020. RESULTS: 618 patients were included, with an overall in-hospital cumulative mortality incidence of 23.1%. Most prescribed early treatments were antivirals (72%), antibiotics (65%) and hydroxychloroquine/anticoagulants (≈50%). Tocilizumab, indeed, was largely prescribed late during hospitalization. Multivariable models, with a cut-off at day 2 for early COVID-19 therapy administration, did not disclose any significant association of a single drug administration on the clinical outcome. DISCUSSION: COVOCA represents the first multicenter database in Campania region. None drug class used during the pandemic significantly modified the outcome, regardless of therapy beginning, both overall and net of those already in non-invasive ventilation (NIV)/ orotracheal intubation (OTI) at hospitalization. Our cumulative incidence of mortality seems lower than other described during the same period, particularly in Northern Italy.","Pafundi, Pia Clara; Galiero, Raffaele; Simeon, Vittorio; Rinaldi, Luca; Perrella, Alessandro; Vetrano, Erica; Caturano, Alfredo; Alfano, Maria; Beccia, Domenico; Nevola, Riccardo; Marfella, Raffaele; Sardu, Celestino; Coppola, Carmine; Scarano, Ferdinando; Maggi, Paolo; De Lucia Sposito, Pellegrino; Vocciante, Laura; Rescigno, Carolina; Sbreglia, Costanza; Fraganza, Fiorentino; Parrella, Roberto; Romano, Annamaria; Calabria, Giosuele; Polverino, Benedetto; Pagano, Antonio; Bologna, Carolina; Amitrano, Maria; Esposito, Vincenzo; Coppola, Nicola; Maturo, Nicola; Adinolfi, Luigi Elio; Chiodini, Paolo; Sasso, Ferdinando Carlo",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34520465/,130

We aimed to estimate the cumulative attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in hemodialysis patients in China using a serological test. METHODS: We enrolled all hemodialysis patients from 8 hemodialysis facilities in Honghu and Jingzhou of Hubei province and Guangzhou and Foshan of Guangdong province in China. We screened these patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection by both a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for viral RNA and a serological test for IgG and IgM antibodies. Data on demographics and clinical characteristics were collected by means of case report forms. We also enrolled the health care workers (HCWs) from the participating hospitals and compared the seropositive rate between hemodialysis patients and HCWs in the same region. RESULTS: Among 1542 hemodialysis patients, 5 (0.32%) and 51 (3.3%) tested positive by the RT-PCR test and the serological test, respectively. The seropositive rate in Hubei (3.6%) was higher than that in Guangdong (2.8%), although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.5). Most of the seropositive patients were asymptomatic. Independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection were age greater than 65 years, a manifestation of lung infection on imaging examinations, and a lower level of serum albumin. In comparison, the seropositive rate in 3205 health care workers was 1.2%, which was significantly lower than that observed in the hemodialysis patients (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The cumulative rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hemodialysis patients in China was high, at 3.3%. The serological test detected 10 times more cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection than the RT-PCR test, and should be the preferred tool for estimating the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Xu, Xin; Nie, Sheng; Sun, Jian; Kong, Yaozhong; Liang, Min; Li, Dongfeng; Ma, Tean; Peng, Jiaqing; Gao, Shikui; Shao, Yong; Zha, Yan; Peng, Gangyi; Ren, Chanjun; Huang, Ailong; Hou, Fan Fan",Kidney Int Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ekir.2021.07.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468024921013462; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468024921013462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34490411/,130

The extended model presents interesting peculiarities as, for example, initial oscillatory patterns in the curve counting the infectious individuals.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it remains unclear whether this type of therapy affects the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of the study was to observe patients with psoriasis undergoing biological or other systemic treatment in relation to the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the course of psoriasis and the COVID-19 disease itself. Materials and methods: A one-year observational study included 57 patients with diagnosed psoriasis who qualified for biological treatment and a group of 68 similar patients who were administered a different systemic treatment. Patients were analyzed monthly for psoriasis (including Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) assessment) and constantly for SARS-CoV-2 infection (telephone contact). Cases of COVID-19 were confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) at the study center. Results: SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by a positive Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test in eight patients (14.0%) with psoriasis on biological therapy. None of the cases in this group required hospitalization for COVID-19. Similar data were obtained in the control group. Specifically, 11 (16%) patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. These results were statistically comparable (p > 0.05). In the group of patients undergoing biological treatment, six (75%) of eight patients developed an exacerbation of psoriasis during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and similar results were noted in the control group, with eight (72%) patients experiencing an exacerbation of psoriasis. Conclusions: Patients with psoriasis who were administered biological treatment or other systemic therapy may experience a mild course of SARS-CoV-2 infection but might also experience a temporary exacerbation of skin lesions.","Mroz, Magdalena; Mućka, Szymon; Miodońska, Martyna; Ziolkowska, Dominika; Hadas, Ewa; Bożek, Andrzej",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577804/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57090881,130
683254,The digital clinic: Implementing technology and augmenting care for mental health,2020-06-30,"Abstract Objectives: CoViD-19's second wave started a debate on the potential role of schools as a primary factor in the contagion resurgence. Two opposite positions appeared: those convinced that schools played a major role in spreading SARS-CoV-2 infections and those who were not. We studied the growth rate of the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in all the Italian regions, before and after the school reopening (September - October 2020), investigating the hypothesis of an association between schools and the resurgence of the virus in Italy. Methods: Using Bayesian piecewise linear regression to scrutinize the number of daily SARS-CoV-2 infections in each Italian, we looked for an estimate of a changepoint in the growth rate of those confirmed cases. We compared the changepoints with the school opening dates, for each Italian region. The regression allows to discuss the change in steepness of the infection curve, before and after the changepoint. Results: In 15 out of 21 Italian regions (71%), an estimated change in the rate of growth of the total number of daily SARS-CoV-2 infection cases occurred after an average of 16.66 days (CI 95% 14.47 to 18.73) since the school reopening. The number of days required for the SARS-CoV-2 daily cases to double went from an average of 47.50 days (CI 95% 37.18 to 57.61) before the changepoint to an average of 7.72 days (CI 95% 7.00 to 8.48) after it. Conclusion: Studying the rate of growth of daily SARS-CoV-2 cases in all the Italian regions provides some evidence in favor of a link between school reopening and the resurgence of the virus in Italy. The number of factors that could have played a role are too many to give a definitive answer.

COVID-19-induced excessive immune response accompanied with uncontrolled release of cytokines culminating in cytokine storm seem to be the common pathogenetic mechanism of these complications. The aim of this narrative review is to elucidate the relation between anaphylaxis associated with profound hypotension or hypoxemia with pro-inflammatory cytokine release. COVID-19 relation with Kounis syndrome and post-COVID-19 vaccination correlation with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT), especially serious cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, were also reviewed. Methods: A current literature search in PubMed, Embase and Google databases was performed to reveal the pathophysiology, prevalence, clinical manifestation, correlation and treatment of COVID-19, anaphylaxis with profuse hypotension, Kounis acute coronary syndrome and thrombotic events post vaccination. Results: The same key immunological pathophysiology mechanisms and cells seem to underlie COVID-19 cardiovascular complications and the anaphylaxis-associated Kounis syndrome. The myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 has been attributed to coronary spasm, plaque rupture and microthrombi formation, hypoxic injury or cytokine storm disposing the same pathophysiology with the three clinical variants of Kounis syndrome.

Such a study should be helpful to access the effectiveness of measures conducted to suppress the pandemic at a local scale. METHODS: We have performed extrapolation of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections with the first stable set of data exploiting exponential growth (linear in logarithmic scale). Based on obtained coefficients it is performed prediction of a number of cases until the end of March. After initial exponential growth, we have changed predictive model to the generalized gamma function. Obtained results are compared with the number of infections and the prediction for the remainder of the outbreak is given. FINDINGS: We have found that the daily growth rate was above 21.5% at the beginning of the period, increased slightly after the introduction of the State of Emergency and the first set of strict epidemical control measures. It took about 13 days after the first set of strict measures to smooth daily growth. It seems that early government measures had an only moderate impact to reduce growth due to the social behavior of citizens and influx of diaspora returning to Serbia from highly affected areas, i.e., the exponential growth of infected persons is kept but with a reduced slope of about 14-15%. Anyway, it is demonstrated that period required that any measure has effect is up to 15 days after introduction, firstly to exponential growth with a smaller rate and after to smooth function representing the number of infected persons below exponential growth rate. CONCLUSIONS: Obtained results are consistent with findings from other countries, i.e., initial exponential growth slows down within the presumed incubation period of 2 weeks after adopting lockdown and other non-pharmaceutical epidemiological measures. However, it is also shown that the exponential growth can continue after this period with a smaller slope. Therefore, quarantine and other social distancing measures should be adopted as soon as possible in a case of any similar outbreak since alternatives mean prolonged epidemical situation and growing costs in human life, pressure on the health system, economy, etc. For modeling the remainder of the outbreak generalized gamma function is used showing accurate results but requiring more samples and pre-processing (data filtering) concerning exponential part of the outbreak. We have estimated the number of infected persons for the remaining part of the outbreak until the end of June.","Djurović, Igor",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566795/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04238; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844020310823; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844020310823?v=s5,130

Aim: To measure the prevalence of fibromyalgia (FM) during COVID outbreak among health workers in Saudi Arabia using FiRST and LFESSQ tool. Methods: The study employed a cross-sectional methodology to explore the prevalence of Fibromyalgia among health workers at different health care settings in Saudi Arabia. The assessment of the prevalence of fibromyalgia among health worker was determined by using the Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool (FiRST) and London Fibromyalgia Epidemiological Study Screening Questionnaire (LFESSQ) questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Results: The sample size included 992 participants. The prevalence of fibromyalgia using FiRST and LFESSQ was 12.6 and 19.8%, respectively. In this study, the prevalence of fibromyalgia was higher in females when compared to males. Most of the respondents have Vitamin D deficiency. The relationship of fibromyalgia was significantly associated with the participants who worked during an outbreak, who covered COVID-19 inpatient, covered in-hospital on call and in area quarantine. Conclusion: The study's findings demonstrate that the prevalence of Fibromyalgia among health service providers during the current COVID-19 pandemic is considerably higher and that there are potential interventions that may be employed to mitigate the prevalence of the infection during the COVID-19 crisis.","AlEnzi, Fahidah; Alhamal, Sara; Alramadhan, Maryam; Altaroti, Ahmed; Siddiqui, Intisar; Aljanobi, Ghada",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34568254/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.693159,130
685420,COVID-19 pandemic against mental health services for genocide survivors during commemoration week in Rwanda,2020-10-13,"The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented global challenge in this century. COVID-19 is a viral respiratory infection, yet the clinical characteristics of this infection differ in spinal cord injury patients from those observed in the general population. Cough and asthenia are the most frequent symptoms in this population. Moreover, infected spinal cord injury patients rarely present complications that require admission to an Intensive Care Unit, in contrast to the general population. Thus, there is a clear need to understand how COVID-19 affects spinal cord injury patients from a molecular perspective. Here, we employed an -omics strategy in order to identify variations in protein abundance in spinal cord injury patients with and without COVID-19. After a quantitative differential analysis using isobaric tags and mass spectrometry and a verification phase, we have found differences mainly related to coagulation and platelet activation. Our results suggest a key role of heparin in the response of spinal cord injury patients to COVID-19 infection, showing a significant correlation between these proteins and heparin dose. Although the number of patients is limited, these data may shed light on new therapeutic options to improve the management these patients and, possibly, those of the general population as well.","Calvo, Enrique; Corbacho-Alonso, Nerea; Sastre-Oliva, Tamara; Nuñez, Estefania; Baena-Galan, Patricia; Hernandez-Fernandez, German; Rodriguez-Cola, Miguel; Jimenez-Velasco, Irena; Corrales, Fernando J.; Gambarrutta-Malfati, Claudia; Gutierrez-Henares, Francisco; Lopez-Dolado, Elisa; Gil-Agudo, Angel; Vazquez, Jesus; Mourino-Alvarez, Laura; Barderas, Maria G.",J Pers Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33096722/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm10040182,130

Rates of pneumonia decrease with the use of antiretroviral therapy but continue to be higher than in HIV uninfected individuals. Risk factors for pneumonia include low blood CD4+ count, unsuppressed plasma HIV load, smoking, injection drug use and renal impairment. Immunization against Streptococcus pneumoniae and smoking cessation can reduce this risk. It is unclear whether newly reported viral respiratory pathogens (such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, will be more of a problem in HIV-infected individuals than the general population.","Brown, James; Lipman, Marc",Curr Infect Dis Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24562542/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-014-0397-x,130

688429,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Physical and Mental Health in Lower and Upper Middle-Income Asian Countries: A Comparison Between the Philippines and China,2021-02-09,"Excessive monocyte/macrophage activation with the development of a cytokine storm and subsequent acute lung injury, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is a feared consequence of infection with COVID‐19. The ability to recognize and potentially intervene early in those patients at greatest risk of developing this complication could be of great clinical utility. In this study, we performed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 34 COVID‐19 patients in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict the severity of disease and patient outcome. Although we did not detect significant differences in the number of monocytes between patients with COVID‐19 and normal healthy individuals, we did identify significant morphologic and functional differences, which are more pronounced in patients requiring prolonged hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Patients with COVID‐19 have larger than normal monocytes, easily identified on forward scatter (FSC), side scatter analysis by routine flow cytometry, with the presence of a distinct population of monocytes with high FSC (FSC‐high). On more detailed analysis, these CD14(+)CD16(+), FSC‐high monocytes show features of mixed M1/M2 macrophage polarization with higher expression of CD80(+) and CD206(+) compared with the residual FSC‐low monocytes and secretion of higher levels of IL‐6, IL‐10, and TNF‐α, when compared with the normal controls. In conclusion, the detection and serial monitoring of this subset of inflammatory monocytes using flow cytometry could be of great help in guiding the prognostication and treatment of patients with COVID‐19 and merits further evaluation.","Zhang, Dan; Guo, Rui; Lei, Lei; Liu, Hongjuan; Wang, Yawen; Wang, Yili; Qian, Hongbo; Dai, Tongxin; Zhang, Tianxiao; Lai, Yanjun; Wang, Jingya; Liu, Zhiqiang; Chen, Tianyan; He, Aili; O'Dwyer, Michael; Hu, Jinsong",J Leukoc Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33040384/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jlb.4hi0720-470r,130
688499,The effect of rapidly discharging psychiatric inpatients from Mental Health Act section during COVID-19: a cohort study,2021-06-25,"Coronaviruses, enveloped nonsegmented positive‐sense RNA viruses, can affect the respiratory and digestive systems of humans and a variety of birds and mammals. The primary target cells of coronaviruses compromise the respiratory and gastrointestinal region epithelial cells due to their cell features and delivery through fomites, airborne, or fecal–oral routes. Some functional food sources due to having crucial chemical compounds may help individuals to overcome this infection by modulating the body's immune system, generating antiviral activity against the infection, and reducing other respiratory problems. The purpose of this study was to review these coronaviruses, especially SARS (because of its very similar gene sequence to the 2019‐nCoV or SARS‐CoV‐2), from the perspective of appropriate approaches to food production technology, including following good food safety practices in food production lines; avoidance of underheating in the processing of swine and the other meat products; uncertainty about the safety of frozen or refrigerated meat products; providing unfavorable environmental conditions for coronavirus survival (minimum heat treatment, e.g., low‐temperature long time and greater for liquid food products, pH ≤ 3, minimum storage relative humidity); production of industrial foods fortified and enriched with vitamin D, C, B3, K, amino acid L‐tryptophan, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)), and tannins; and preventing the production of industrial foods fortified or enriched with mineral supplements that participate in the Fenton reaction in the human body. Considering these aspects during times and places of coronavirus, prevalence will be essential for preventing further outbreaks at the community level.","Goli, Mohammad",Food Sci Nutr,https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.1892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33042532/,130
689857,Delayed educational services during Covid‐19 and their relationships with the mental health of individuals with disabilities,2021-07-22,"BACKGROUND: In January 2020, the WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a public health emergency; by March 11, a pandemic was declared. To date in Ireland, over 3300 patients have been admitted to acute hospitals as a result of infection with COVID-19. AIMS: This article aims to describe the establishment of a COVID Recovery Service, a multidisciplinary service for comprehensive follow-up of patients with a hospital diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A hybrid model of virtual and in-person clinics was established, supported by a multidisciplinary team consisting of respiratory, critical care, infectious diseases, psychiatry, and psychology services. This model identifies patients who need enhanced follow-up following COVID-19 pneumonia and aims to support patients with complications of COVID-19 and those who require integrated community care. RESULTS: We describe a post-COVID-19 service structure together with detailed protocols for multidisciplinary follow-up. One hundred seventy-four patients were discharged from Beaumont Hospital after COVID-19 pneumonia. Sixty-seven percent were male with a median age (IQR) of 66.5 (51–97). Twenty-two percent were admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation, 11% had non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen, and 67% did not have specialist respiratory support. Early data suggests that 48% of these patients will require medium to long-term specialist follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the implementation of an integrated multidisciplinary approach to patients with COVID-19, identifying those with increased physical and mental healthcare needs. Our initial experience suggests that significant physical, psychological, and cognitive impairments may persist despite clinical resolution of the infection.","O’Brien, Helen; Tracey, Michael J.; Ottewill, Ciara; O’Brien, Michael E.; Morgan, Ross K.; Costello, Richard W.; Gunaratnam, Cedric; Ryan, Daniel; McElvaney, Noel G.; McConkey, Samuel J.; McNally, Cora; Curley, Gerard F.; MacHale, Siobhan; Gillan, Diane; Pender, Niall; Barry, Helen; de Barra, Eoghan; Kiernan, Fiona M.; Sulaiman, Imran; Hurley, Killian",Ir J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-020-02354-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894436/,130

In temperate countries, seasonal activity of respiratory viruses has been reported, particularly in association with temperature, while inconsistent correlation of respiratory viral activity with humidity and rain is found in tropical countries. A retrospective study was performed from 1982-2008 to investigate the viral etiology of children (≤ 5 years old) admitted with RTI in a tertiary hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. METHODS: A total of 10269 respiratory samples from all children ≤ 5 years old received at the hospital's diagnostic virology laboratory between 1982-2008 were included in the study. Immunofluorescence staining (for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1-3, and adenovirus) and virus isolation were performed. The yearly hospitalization rates and annual patterns of laboratory-confirmed viral RTIs were determined. Univariate ANOVA was used to analyse the demographic parameters of cases. Multiple regression and Spearman's rank correlation were used to analyse the correlation between RSV cases and meteorological parameters. RESULTS: A total of 2708 cases were laboratory-confirmed using immunofluorescence assays and viral cultures, with the most commonly detected being RSV (1913, 70.6%), parainfluenza viruses (357, 13.2%), influenza viruses (297, 11.0%), and adenovirus (141, 5.2%). Children infected with RSV were significantly younger, and children infected with influenza viruses were significantly older. The four main viruses caused disease throughout the year, with a seasonal peak observed for RSV in September-December. Monthly RSV cases were directly correlated with rain days, and inversely correlated with relative humidity and temperature. CONCLUSION: Viral RTIs, particularly due to RSV, are commonly detected in respiratory samples from hospitalized children in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. As in temperate countries, RSV infection in tropical Malaysia also caused seasonal yearly epidemics, and this has implications for prophylaxis and vaccination programmes.","Khor, Chee-Sieng; Sam, I-Ching; Hooi, Poh-Sim; Quek, Kia-Fatt; Chan, Yoke-Fun",BMC Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-12-32; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22429933/,130
