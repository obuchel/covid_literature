16138,"Intersecting stigma and HIV testing practices among urban refugee adolescents and youth in Kampala, Uganda: qualitative findings",2021-03-13,"The electrocardiogram (ECG) has significant clinical importance for analyzing most cardiovascular diseases. ECGs beat morphologies, beat durations, and amplitudes vary from subject to subject and diseases to diseases. Therefore, ECG morphology-based modeling has long-standing research interests. This work aims to develop a simplified ECG model based on a minimum number of parameters that could correctly represent ECG morphology in different cardiac dysrhythmias. A simple mathematical model based on the sum of two Gaussian functions is proposed. However, fitting more than one Gaussian function in a deterministic way has accuracy and localization problems. To solve these fitting problems, two hybrid optimization methods have been developed to select the optimal ECG model parameters. The first method is the combination of an approximation and global search technique (ApproxiGlo), and the second method is the combination of an approximation and multi-start search technique (ApproxiMul). The proposed model and optimization methods have been applied to real ECGs in different cardiac dysrhythmias, and the effectiveness of the model performance was measured in time, frequency, and the time-frequency domain. The model fit different types of ECG beats representing different cardiac dysrhythmias with high correlation coefficients (>0.98). Compared to the nonlinear fitting method, ApproxiGlo and ApproxiMul are 3.32 and 7.88 times better in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), respectively. Regarding optimization, the ApproxiMul performs better than the ApproxiGlo method in many metrics. Different uses of this model are possible, such as a syntactic ECG generator using a graphical user interface has been developed and tested. In addition, the model can be used as a lossy compression with a variable compression rate. A compression ratio of 20:1 can be achieved with 1 kHz sampling frequency and 75 beats per minute. These optimization methods can be used in different engineering fields where the sum of Gaussians is used.","Awal, Md.

20619,Guest Editors,2020-04-17,"Lithium chloride has been widely used as a therapeutic mood stabilizer. Although cumulative evidence suggests that lithium plays modulatory effects on postsynaptic receptors, the underlying mechanism by which lithium regulates synaptic transmission has not been fully elucidated. In this work, by using the advantageous neuromuscular synapse, we evaluated the effect of lithium on the stability of postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in vivo. We found that in normally innervated neuromuscular synapses, lithium chloride significantly decreased the turnover of nAChRs by reducing their internalization. A similar response was observed in CHO-K1/A5 cells expressing the adult muscle-type nAChRs. Strikingly, in denervated neuromuscular synapses, lithium led to enhanced nAChR turnover and density by increasing the incorporation of new nAChRs. Lithium also potentiated the formation of unstable nAChR clusters in non-synaptic regions of denervated muscle fibres. We found that denervation-dependent re-expression of the foetal nAChR γ-subunit was not altered by lithium. However, while denervation inhibits the distribution of β-catenin within endplates, lithium-treated fibres retain β-catenin staining in specific foci of the synaptic region. Collectively, our data reveal that lithium treatment differentially affects the stability of postsynaptic receptors in normal and denervated neuromuscular synapses in vivo, thus providing novel insights into the regulatory effects of lithium on synaptic organization and extending its potential therapeutic use in conditions affecting the peripheral nervous system.","Zelada, Diego; Barrantes, Francisco J.; Henríquez, Juan Pablo",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8390761/,677
20647,Guest Editor,2020-09-28,"BACKGROUND: The introduction of Zika and chikungunya to dengue hyperendemic regions increased interest in better understanding characteristics of these infections. We conducted a cohort study in Mexico to evaluate the natural history of Zika infection. We describe here the frequency of Zika, chikungunya and dengue virus infections immediately after Zika introduction in Mexico, and baseline characteristics of participants for each type of infection. METHODS: Prospective, observational cohort evaluating the natural history of Zika virus infection in the Mexico-Guatemala border area. Patients with fever, rash or both, meeting the modified criteria of PAHO for probable Zika cases were enrolled (June 2016–July 2018) and followed-up for 6 months. We collected data on sociodemographic, environmental exposure, clinical and laboratory characteristics. Diagnosis was established based on viral RNA identification in serum and urine samples using RT-PCR for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue. We describe the baseline sociodemographic and environmental exposure characteristics of participants according to diagnosis, and the frequency of these infections over a two-year period immediately after Zika introduction in Mexico. RESULTS: We enrolled 427 participants. Most patients (n = 307, 65.7%) had an acute illness episode with no identified pathogen (UIE), 37 (8%) Zika, 82 (17.6%) dengue, and 1 (0.2%) chikungunya. In 2016 Zika predominated, declined in 2017 and disappeared in 2018; while dengue increased after 2017. Patients with dengue were more likely to be men, younger, and with lower education than those with Zika and UIE. They also reported closer contact with water sources, and with other people diagnosed with dengue. Participants with Zika reported sexual exposure more frequently than people with dengue and UIE. Zika was more likely to be identified in urine while dengue was more likely found in blood in the first seven days of symptoms; but PCR results for both were similar at day 7–14 after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: During the first 2 years of Zika introduction to this dengue hyper-endemic region, frequency of Zika peaked and fell over a two-year period; while dengue progressively increased with a predominance in 2018. Different epidemiologic patterns between Zika, dengue and UIE were observed. Trial registration Clinical.Trials.gov (NCT02831699).

However, expectations that a single course or hopes that technology infusion will spontaneously occur are not enough to prepare teacher candidates to integrate technology in meaningful ways. In the absence of a required educational technology course for all initial licensure candidates, an educator preparation program in the Midwest sought creative solutions to meet accreditation and clinical placement expectations regarding candidate preparation to integrate technology. This report from the field discusses the iterative process to develop a comprehensive micro-credentialing system aligned with the ISTE standards for educators. The micro-credentials provide candidates opportunities to apply and model technology use within courses and throughout their program. Feedback from stakeholders indicated both possibilities and potential challenges in the adoption of the system. This feedback has led to further development of the micro-credentialing system.","Clausen, Jon M.",TechTrends,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514802/,677

64857,Public and health policy for the aged in Africa to the South of Saara.,2020-07-08,"OBJECTIVE Advanced cancer patients who are parents of minor children experience heightened psychosocial distress. Oncology social workers (OSWs) are essential providers of psychosocial support to parents with advanced cancer. Yet, little is known about the experiences and approaches of OSWs in addressing these patients' unique needs. The purpose of this study was to characterize the attitudes, practice behaviors, and training experiences of OSWs who provide psychosocial care for advanced cancer patients with minor children. METHOD Forty-one OSWs participated in a cross-sectional survey addressing multiple facets of their psychosocial care for parents with advanced cancer. The five assessed domains of psychosocial support were communication support, emotional support, household support, illness and treatment decision-making support, and end-of-life planning. RESULTS Participants reported greatest confidence in counseling patients on communication with children about illness and providing support to co-parents about parenting concerns. OSWs reported less confidence in counseling parents on end-of-life issues and assisting families with non-traditional household structures. The majority of participants reported needing more time in their clinical practice to sufficiently address parents' psychosocial needs. Nearly 90% of participants were interested in receiving further training on the care of parents with advanced cancer. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS To improve the care of parents with advanced cancer, it is critical to understand how the psychosocial oncology workforce perceives its clinical practice needs. Study findings suggest an opportunity for enhanced training, particularly with respect to end-of-life needs and in response to the changing household structure of American families.","Quillen, Laura J; Borstelmann, Nancy A; Stanton, Kate E; Nelson, Courtney A; Chien, Stephanie A; Bowers, Savannah M; Swift, Catherine L; Gonzalez, Yulissa; Yi, Samantha M; Park, Eliza M",Palliative & supportive care,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1478951520001005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985404/,677
67875,Variability in size and characteristics of primary care networks in England: observational study.,2020-11-02,"The correct identification of change-points during ongoing outbreak investigations of infectious diseases is a matter of paramount importance in epidemiology, with major implications for the management of health care resources, public health and, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, social live. Onsets, peaks, and inflexion points are some of them. An onset is the moment when the epidemic starts. A ""peak"" indicates a moment at which the incorporated values, both before and after, are lower: a maximum. The inflexion points identify moments in which the rate of growth of the incorporation of new cases changes intensity. In this study, after interpreting the concept of elasticity of a random variable in an innovative way, we propose using it as a new simpler tool for anticipating epidemic remission change-points. In particular, we propose that the ""remission point of change"" will occur just at the instant when the speed in the accumulation of new cases is lower than the average speed of accumulation of cases up to that moment. This gives stability and robustness to the estimation in the event of possible remission variations. This descriptive measure, which is very easy to calculate and interpret, is revealed as informative and adequate, has the advantage of being distribution-free and can be estimated in real time, while the data is being collected. We use the 2014-2016 Western Africa Ebola virus epidemic to demonstrate this new approach. A couple of examples analyzing COVID-19 data are also included.","Veres-Ferrer, Ernesto J; Pavía, Jose M",Statistics in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33174250/,677
70311,Rosuvastatin Myotoxicity After Starting Canagliflozin Treatment.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a major risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. It is believed that BE is caused by chronic gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery (LARS) restores the competency of the cardia and may thereby change the natural course of BE. We studied the impact of LARS on the histological profile of BE and on the control of GERD. METHODS We identified all patients with BE who underwent LARS from 1994 to 2007 and contacted them to assess post-operative GERD symptoms via questionnaire. Endoscopy findings, histology, 24 hour pH monitoring, and manometry were also collected using our prospectively maintained database. Histological regression was defined as either loss of dysplasia or disappearance of BE. RESULTS Two hundred and fifteen patients met the initial inclusion criteria; in 82 of them histology from post-operative endoscopy was available for review. Endoscopy was performed a median of 8 years (range, 1-16 years) after surgery. Regression of BE occurred in 18 (22%) patients while in 6 (7%) BE progressed to dysplasia or cancer. Thirty-six (43%) patients underwent pre- and post-operative manometry. The median lower esophageal sphincter pressure increased from 9 to 17 mmHg in these patients. Thirty-four (41%) patients underwent pre- and post-operative pH studies. The median DeMeester score decreased from 54 to 9. Sixty-seven (82%) of 82 patients completed the post-operative questionnaire; 86% of these patients reported improvement in heartburn and regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS LARS was associated with both physiologic and symptomatic control of GERD in patients with BE. LARS resulted in regression of BE in 22% of patients and progression in 7%. Thus, continued surveillance of Barrett's is needed after LARS.","Morrow, Ellen; Bushyhead, Daniel; Wassenaar, Eelco; Hinojosa, Marcelo; Loviscek, Maximiliano; Pellegrini, Carlos; Oelschlager, Brant",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3601-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24935200/,677
71177,A tale of two epidemics: France and the UK.,2021,"Diabetes mellitus is a complex, multifactorial, chronic disease characterized by impaired metabolism of glucose, fats and proteins. Patients who suffer from it frequently have hyperglycemia and coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death. The comorbidities associated with diabetes are overweight and obesity, systemic arterial hypertension, atherogenic dyslipidemia and in some patients peripheral vascular disease, kidney damage, neuropathy and retinopathy. Chronic lack of control of the disease is associated with increased susceptibility to infections, which generally have few symptoms, but hyperglycemia is generally magnified, which worsens the course of infections. Since December 2019, when the disease caused by one of the coronaviruses (coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS-CoV-2) was identified and has been called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there have been some reports that associate the presence of diabetes with an increased risk of mortality. In this review article we have focused on four specific points: 1) epidemiology of the prevalence and mortality of COVID 19 in the general population and in the population with type 2 diabetes mellitus; 2) pathophysiology related to the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to receptors in subjects with diabetes; 3) the immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2, and 4) the outpatient and hospital treatment recommended in patients with diabetes who become infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Torres-Tamayo, Margarita; Caracas-Portillo, Nacú A; Peña-Aparicio, Berenice; Juárez-Rojas, Juan G; Medina-Urrutia, Aida X; Martínez-Alvarado, María Del R",Archivos de cardiologia de Mexico,https://doi.org/10.24875/acm.m20000068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32523141/,677
71984,Rethinking the use of 'vulnerable'.,2021-04-05,"OBJECTIVE The objective is to systematically review the literature studying the harmonic scalpel versus other hemostatic techniques in thyroid surgical patients. Although thyroidectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures, the safest, most efficient, and cost-effective way to achieve hemostasis is hotly debated. DATA SOURCES We searched the electronic databases Medline and the Cochrane Library using relevant search strategies. REVIEW METHODS Two reviewers (G.W., T.E.) independently assessed titles and abstracts of 72 identified studies. Twelve prospective randomized controlled studies were considered relevant and included in this meta-analysis (1153 patients). RESULTS In all studies, operating time was reduced by using the harmonic scalpel. Compared with surgical hemostasis by suture ligation or suture/clip ligation combined with electrocauterization or electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer (n = 602), the mean operating time reduction for the harmonic scalpel was equivalent to 22.67 minutes (95% CI, -27.98; -17.37, P < 0.00001) or nearly 25 percent of the total operating room time. When harmonic scalpel was used, blood loss was reduced significantly by 20.03 mL (95% CI, -27.83; -12.22, P < 0.00001), and a mean reduction in postoperative pain (0.86 points [95% CI, -1.60; -0.13, P = 0.02]) was measured. Length of stay was reduced by 0.12 days (95% CI, -0.25; 0.00, P = 0.05). Differences regarding volume of drainage fluid were in favor of harmonic scalpel but not statistically significant; complications were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION There is clear evidence that using the harmonic scalpel for hemostasis in thyroid surgery significantly reduces operating time and blood loss and that it is not associated with an increase in volume of drainage fluid, complication rate, or hospital stay.","Ecker, Thomas; Carvalho, Andre Lopes; Choe, Jun-Ho; Walosek, Gudrun; Preuss, Klaus Juergen",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.otohns.2010.03.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20620614/,677

METHODS The literature search was executed in the databases of Scopus and Espacenet. Overall, 120 patents and 49 articles have been reviewed and categorized. RESULTS The identified treatment tools were divided into three treatment modalities: compression, resection, and conversion. A further subdivision was made based on the force direction, i.e., axial, radial, tangential, or energy conversion process (dissolving or state change). CONCLUSION The working principles of the identified treatment tools relate strongly to the (biomechanical) properties of the occlusion and environment. In order to increase procedural success, especially in chronic occlusions, the applied force should be increased by applying buckling prevention methods, the penetration force decreased by smart tip design or dynamic loading, and the energy dissipation to the environment minimized.

However, Australian research involving nurses, particularly across the acute care sector, is limited. This cross-sectional research aimed to explore the impact of pandemic-related stress on psychological adjustment outcomes and potential protective factors for nurses (n = 767) working in the Australian acute care sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses completed an online questionnaire with psychometrically validated measures of pandemic-related stress, psychological adjustment outcomes (depression, anxiety, and subjective well-being), and protective factors (posttraumatic growth and self-compassion). Descriptive analyses revealed that pandemic-related stress was reported by 17.7% of the participants. Psychological adjustment outcome scores above normal for depression (27.5%) and anxiety (22.0%) were found, and 36.4% of the participants reported poor subjective well-being. Regression analyses suggest that pandemic-related stress predicted greater depression (B = 0.32, SE = 0.02, 95% confidence interval [0.28, 0.35]) and anxiety (B = 0.26, SE = 0.01, 95% confidence interval [0.24, 0.29]) and less subjective well-being (B = -0.14, SE = 0.01, 95% confidence interval [-0.16, -0.12]). Self-compassion weakened the relationship between pandemic-related stress and greater depression, however, exacerbated the relationship between pandemic-related stress and less subjective well-being. Posttraumatic growth reduced the negative relationship between pandemic-related stress and psychological adjustment outcomes. These findings will inform strategies to facilitate psychological resources that support nurses' psychological adjustment, enabling better pandemic preparedness at both an individual and organizational level.","Aggar, Christina; Samios, Christina; Penman, Olivia; Whiteing, Nicola; Massey, Deb; Rafferty, Rae; Bowen, Karen; Stephens, Alexandre",International journal of mental health nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34636134/,677

Patients with High Blood Pressure (HBP) are often asked to have their BP checked at home. The traditional at-home procedure has some drawbacks, such as forgetting to check or write down the values, errors in transcribing the numbers, or the impossibility of immediately notifying medical staff of out-of-range BP values. To facilitate self-measurements by patients at home we devised TensioBot, a Telegram based chatbot. The bot sends patients reminders to check their BP, advice on good monitoring practices, measurement tracking, medical alerts and allows healthcare professionals to access up-to-date measurement information. TensioBot has been tested for two years in a randomized controlled trial with 112 patients (55 using the bot and 57 in the control group). We found that, although the bot group showed similar results in terms of adherence to the BP checking schedule, bot users scored better in terms of knowledge and skills on BP checking best practices. Participants rated the bot very positively, perceived it as useful and easy to use, and continued to use it after the intervention. Moreover, all data being equal, we describe some other benefits of using a chatbot for self-managed in-house BP control, both for patients and healthcare professionals and systems.","Echeazarra, Leyre; Pereira, Juanan; Saracho, Ramón",Journal of medical systems,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10916-021-01730-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723721/,677

100352,Charging for NHS care and its impact on maternal health.,2021-04-01,"Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an established and potent independent risk factor for degenerative diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), Alzheimer disease, type II diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. HHcy has been shown to inhibit proliferation and promote inflammatory responses in endothelial cells (EC), and impair endothelial function, a hallmark for vascular injury. However, metabolic processes and molecular mechanisms mediating HHcy-induced endothelial injury remains to be elucidated. This study examined the effects of HHcy on the expression of microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA in human aortic EC treated with a pathophysiologically relevant concentration of homocysteine (Hcy 500 μM). We performed a set of extensive bioinformatics analyses to identify HHcy-altered metabolic and molecular processes. The global functional implications and molecular network were determined by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) followed by Cytoscape analysis. We identified 244 significantly differentially expressed (SDE) mRNA, their relevant functional pathways, and 45 SDE miRNA. HHcy-altered SDE inversely correlated miRNA-mRNA pairs (45 induced/14 reduced mRNA) were discovered and applied to network construction using an experimentally verified database. We established a hypothetical model to describe the biochemical and molecular network with these specified miRNA/mRNA axes, finding: 1) HHcy causes metabolic reprogramming by increasing glucose uptake and oxidation, by glycogen debranching and NAD+/CoA synthesis, and by stimulating mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production via NNT/IDH2 suppression-induced NAD+/NADP-NADPH/NADP+ metabolism disruption; 2) HHcy activates inflammatory responses by activating inflammasome-pyroptosis mainly through ↓miR193b→↑CASP-9 signaling and by inducing IL-1β and adhesion molecules through the ↓miR29c→↑NEDD9 and the ↓miR1256→↑ICAM-1 axes, as well as GPCR and interferon α/β signaling; 3) HHcy promotes cell degradation by the activation of lysosome autophagy and ubiquitin proteasome systems; 4) HHcy causes cell cycle arrest at G1/S and S/G2 transitions, suppresses spindle checkpoint complex and cytokinetic abscission, and suppresses proliferation through ↓miRNA335/↑VASH1 and other axes.

Even if benign, they may require a treatment in case of symptoms or cosmetic concerns. In the last years, minimally invasive treatments alternative to surgery have been developed, in particular ultrasound (US) guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Methods Twenty-four patients (9 males; 15 females; mean age 57.9 years) were treated and divided in two groups (A and B) according to the RFA needle used (18 gauge needle, AMICA; 17 gauge needle, COVIDIEN). Nodules and patients characteristics, together with procedural data were registered pre-treatment and at 1-month follow-up. US visibility of the needle, volume of the nodules, symptoms and cosmetic concerns, complications were registered. Results Visibility of the needle was not significantly different in the two groups (P=0.0787). At 1 month the mean volume of the nodules dropped from 37.1 to 25 mL in group A and from 23.2 to 15.4 mL in group B; shrinkage rate (36.9% and 39.5%, respectively) was not significantly different (P=0.3137). Symptoms decreased from 3.1 to 1.4 in group A and from 4 to 1.6 in group B: no significant differences in reductions were observed (P=0.3305). Cosmetic score decreased from 3.7 to 3.4 in group A and from 3.9 to 3.6 in group B: no significant differences in reductions were observed (P=0.96). Total complication rate (18.2% in group A vs. 23.1% in group B) did not showed significant differences (P=0.5049). Conclusions The two systems used in our study resulted equivalent in terms of US needle visibility, efficacy, symptom/cosmetic relief, safety.

SOURCES OF DATA We systematically searched Medline (PubMED), EMBASE, CINHAL, Cochrane, Sports Discus and Google scholar databases using the combined keywords 'open repair', 'percutaneous surgery', 'minimally invasive surgery' 'Achilles tendon rupture', 'complications', 'infections', 'wound disorders' to identify articles published in English, Spanish, French and Italian. AREAS OF AGREEMENT Twelve studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Six studies were retrospective, five were randomized controlled trials and one was a prospective investigation. Of a total of 781 patients, 375 underwent open repair and 406 percutaneous surgery. Different procedures were performed for open and minimally invasive repair. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY The range of motion was significantly greater after percutaneous repair than open surgery. The number of complications that occurred after open surgery was higher than after minimally invasive surgery. GROWING POINTS Minimally invasive surgery is less expensive and less time demanding. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH Minimally invasive and open surgery of the Achilles tendon are grossly equivalent. However, iatrogenic neurological complications are more frequent after percutaneous repair. Novel percutaneous repairs have been proposed to minimize the risk of sural nerve injury.","Del Buono, Angelo; Volpin, Andrea; Maffulli, Nicola",British medical bulletin,https://doi.org/10.1093/bmb/ldt029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24126569/,677

Chronic pain patients typically respond well initially to opioid medications, but regular use is associated with adverse psychological and physical effects. Patients with significant psychiatric comorbidity and substance use issues are more likely to stay on opioids and to receive higher doses. In the common rheumatological conditions of fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis, opioid treatment is of limited benefit because of lack of efficacy and prominent side effects. Chronic opioid therapy may be more usefully regarded as a form of comfort care, reserved for those patients who have exhausted other treatments and prospects of recovery.","Krashin, Daniel; Sullivan, Mark; Ballantyne, Jane",Current rheumatology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11926-012-0311-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23371480/,677

Our aim was to gain insight into the lived experience of clinicians who worked in ICUs during the surge. DESIGN Qualitative study using semistructured, in-depth interviews. SETTING Clinicians who worked in three ICUs in Paris (France) during the peak of the pandemic (April and May 2020). PARTICIPANTS Twenty-seven ICU clinicians (12 physicians, 11 nurses, three nursing assistants, and one respiratory therapist). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Interviews were audio recorded and analyzed using thematic analysis. Six themes emerged: coping with initial disorganization and creating new routines, the intensification of professional relationships and the development of unexpected collaborations, losing one's reference points and recreating meaningful interactions with patients, working under new constraints and developing novel interactions with family members, compensating for the absence of family members and rituals at the end of life, and the full engagement of ICU clinicians during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis. CONCLUSIONS Among ICU clinicians, there was a sense of total professional engagement during the surge. Caring for critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients was fraught with challenges and generated a strong feeling of responsibility, as clinicians felt they had to compensate for the absence of family members. Rethinking policies about family visits and safeguarding positive relationships among colleagues are two important priorities for future healthcare crises.","Kentish-Barnes, Nancy; Morin, Lucas; Cohen-Solal, Zoé; Cariou, Alain; Demoule, Alexandre; Azoulay, Elie",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33591018/,677

Highly potent analogs pose an increased risk for fatal overdose. The prevalence of fentanyl analog exposures in patients with known opioid exposure is unknown.Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the exposure prevalence for fentanyl analogs in living patients with positive urine screens for opiates or fentanyl.Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of urine high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectroscopy (HPLC-MS/MS) results from patients with a positive urine screen for opiates or fentanyl at a large public healthcare system in Chicago, Illinois. Samples with positive screens were non-continuously tested by HPLC-MS/MS for 5 selected months in 2018 and 2019.Results: A total of 219 urine samples which screened positive for fentanyl or opiates underwent HPLC-MS/MS testing. At least one fentanyl analog was detected in 65.3% (n = 143) of samples with 26.0% (n = 57) testing positive for multiple analogs. The most common analogs, intermediates, or metabolites were: 4-ANPP (n = 131); 2-furanylfentanyl (n = 22); acryl fentanyl (n = 21); butyrylfentanyl (n = 15); cyclopropylfentanyl (n = 15); and carfentanil (n = 13). Of samples which screened positive for fentanyl (n = 188), 70.2% (132) tested positive for at least one fentanyl analog. Of samples which screened negative for fentanyl but positive for opiates (n = 31), 35.5% (n = 11) tested positive for fentanyl analogsConclusion: Fentanyl analog exposure is common in patients with positive urine screens for fentanyl or opiates. Screening living patient samples for synthetic opioids has future toxicosurveillance implications and these data underscore the increased risks from illicit opioid use.","Chhabra, Neeraj; Rizvanolli, Lum; Rasin, Arkady; Marsden, Granger; Hinami, Keiki; Aks, Steven E",The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/00952990.2021.1891420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33798014/,677

Traditionally, peer-reviewed journal articles have been at the core of advancement deliberations. With the increasing prominence digital content and social media, an increasing number of academics have begun linking their scholarly value with their online activities. It is unclear whether and how US academic medical institutions have updated their promotion criteria to reflect the changing environment and digital practices of faculty members. METHODS We reviewed publicly available advancement and promotion policies and faculty handbooks of 148 allopathic medical schools in the United States (April 2018 through September 2018), to see if social media was explicitly included in their scholarship criteria. RESULTS Of the 148 allopathic institutions only 12 (8.1%) stated that digital and social media products would be factored into the scholarship and/or other domains of the promotion application. There were no associations between acceptability of social media in the tenure process and schools' characteristics. CONCLUSIONS Digital media use has the potential to distribute scholarship widely. Including digital scholarship in promotion would help destigmatize the use of digital platforms and promote science dissemination to the public. Medical institutions should embrace new models of digital scholarship and lead the way in defining and ensuring quality.","Johng, Stephanie Y; Mishori, Ranit; Korostyshevskiy, Valeriy R",Family medicine,https://doi.org/10.22454/fammed.2021.146684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723821/,677

However, some preliminary studies have shown that patients with a BMI that does not meet these criteria could also experience similar weight loss and the benefits associated with it. METHODS An institutional review board-approved protocol was obtained to study the effectiveness of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding in patients with a low BMI. A total of 66 patients with a BMI of 30-35 kg/m(2) and co-morbidities (n = 22) or a BMI of 35-40 kg/m(2) without co-morbidities (n = 44) underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. These patients were compared with 438 standard patients who had undergone laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding who met the National Institutes of Health criteria for bariatric surgery. The excess weight loss at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months and the status of their co-morbidities were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS The average BMI for the study group was 36.1 +/- 2.6 kg/m(2) compared with 46.0 +/- 7.3 kg/m(2) for the control group. Both groups had significant co-morbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, arthritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, stress incontinence, and obstructive sleep apnea. The mean percentage of excess weight loss was 20.3% +/- 9.0%, 28.5% +/- 14.0%, 44.7% +/- 19.3%, and 42.2% +/- 33.7% at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively. This was not significantly different from the excess weight loss in the control group, except for at 12 months. Both groups showed similar improvement of most co-morbidities. CONCLUSION Moderately obese patients whose BMI is less than the current guidelines for bariatric surgery will have similar weight loss and associated benefits. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding is a safe and effective treatment for patients with a BMI of 30-35 kg/m(2).","Choi, Jenny; Digiorgi, Mary; Milone, Luca; Schrope, Beth; Olivera-Rivera, Lorraine; Daud, Amna; Davis, Dan; Bessler, Marc",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2009.09.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20185374/,677

However, there is no information available on the treatment of SCTD. METHODS We report a patient who underwent intravenous thiamine replacement therapy for about a month after being diagnosed with SCTD, but who developed SCTD again about three weeks after finishing the treatment. RESULTS The patient was a 64-year-old woman who, after starting treatment for cervical cancer, complained of anxiety and underwent an initial psychiatric examination. The psychiatric diagnosis was an adjustment disorder. Based on the possibility of SCTD complications due to her decreased appetite and weight loss, her serum thiamine concentration was measured and found to be low. Therefore, thiamine was administered intravenously for 29 days. At the end of treatment, thiamine administration was discontinued as there were no apparent neuropsychiatric symptoms or problems with appetite. Twenty-three days later, there were still no problems with appetite or neuropsychiatric symptoms, but a follow-up blood sample revealed that her serum thiamine was again below the normal range. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS Currently, there is no information available regarding the diagnosis and treatment of SCTD in cancer patients. In some cases, such as this case, the deficiency recurs without any symptoms indicative of SCTD; therefore, further examination for diagnosis and treatment is necessary.","Onishi, Hideki; Uchida, Nozomu; Itami, Kumi; Sato, Masakazu; Tamura, Saki; Kurosaki, Akira; Ishida, Mayumi",Palliative & supportive care,https://doi.org/10.1017/s147895152000098x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985409/,677
124285,Discovering novel zoonotic viruses.,2011,"Using approaches of transcriptomics and proteomics we have shown that the phenotype of Bothrops jararaca venom undergoes a significant rearrangement upon neonate to adult transition. Most regulatory processes in biology are intrinsically related to modifications of protein structure, function, and abundance. However, it is unclear to which extent intrinsic proteolysis affects toxins and snake venom phenotypes upon ontogenesis. Here we assessed the natural N-terminome of Bothrops jararaca newborn and adult venoms and explored the degree of N-terminal protein truncation in ontogenetic-based proteome variation. To this end we applied the Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS) technology to characterize venom collected in the presence of proteinase inhibitors. We identified natural N-terminal sequences in the newborn (71) and adult (84) venoms, from which only 37 were common to both. However, truncated toxins were found in higher number in the newborn (212) than in the adult (140) venom. Moreover, sequences N-terminally blocked by pyroglutamic acid were identified in the newborn (55) and adult (49) venoms. Most toxin classes identified by their natural N-terminal sequences showed a similar number of unique peptides in the newborn and adult venoms, however, those of serine proteinases and C-type lectins were more abundant in the adult venom. Truncated sequences from at least ten toxin classes were detected, however the catalytic and cysteine-rich domains of metalloproteinases were the most prone to proteolysis, mainly in the newborn venom. Our results underscore the pervasiveness of truncations in most toxin classes and highlight variable post-translational events in newborn and adult venoms.","Andrade-Silva, Débora; Nishiyama, MiltonY; Stuginski, Daniel R; Zelanis, André; Serrano, Solange M T",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

However, less is known about the role of late-life onset insomnia and sex involved in these dyad or tripartite relationships. This study aimed to consider onset age of insomnia and sex in the relationship between sleep parameters, cognition and depression among older adults with current insomnia complaints. METHOD A multistep sampling method was adopted to recruit participants with current insomnia complaints in China in 2018. Sleep measures include onset age of insomnia (64 years old or before vs during/after 65), three factors from insomnia severity index (ISI; nighttime, daytime, and perception), excessive daytime sleepiness, and sleep duration. Outcome measures were mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and center for epidemiologic studies depression scale (CESD). RESULTS The average age of older adults was 75 (SD = 7.1). Among them, 62% participants are female. In general, older aged, female, late-life onset insomnia as well as interaction of sex * onset age of insomnia were significantly associated with poorer cognition. Yet, age, sex, and onset age of insomnia were not significant indicators for depression. For female participants, later onset of insomnia, nighttime symptoms of insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness and depression were risk factors for cognitive decline. Nevertheless, only daytime sleepiness, together with depression, were found positively associated with male participants' cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS There were robust associations between daytime sleepiness, depressive symptoms, and poor cognitive performance. More importantly, late-life onset insomnia was particularly indicative for poor cognitive performance among female older adults. Future study should emphasize the specific mechanism involved in changes of sleep patterns in the development of cognitive impairment among older adults. Sex differences in the relationship between onset age of insomnia and cognition also require further attention.","Ji, Xiaowen; Fu, Yuanyuan",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.5401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411399/,677

We therefore evaluated PED cases complicated by acute thrombus formation at our institution, with an emphasis on identifying early angiographic signs that may portend this event. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively identified cases of acute thrombosis following PED placement in 100 consecutive procedures performed at our institution from a prospectively maintained clinical database. Angiographic findings were analyzed for early signs of acute thrombus formation. We also evaluated the efficacy of treatment of this complication with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (abciximab), as well as the results of pre-procedure platelet inhibition testing. RESULTS Acute thrombus formation was encountered in five patients following PED placement (5%). Early angiographic signs were present in all cases and included progressive stagnation of blood flow in covered side branches, occlusion of covered side branches, excessive stagnation of blood flow in the target aneurysm, as well as occlusion of the target aneurysm. These sequelae completely resolved following abciximab treatment in all five cases, with no permanent neurological morbidity or mortality. Four of the five patients had a pre-procedure P2Y12 value >200 (range 201-227). CONCLUSIONS Progressive stagnation or occlusion of covered side branches or target aneurysm are early angiographic signs of acute thrombus formation following PED placement and should prompt immediate treatment with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Platelet inhibition testing may help identify those patients who are at an increased risk for this complication.","Patel, Akil; Miller, Timothy R; Shivashankar, Ravi; Jindal, Gaurav; Gandhi, Dheeraj",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2016-012701; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27770038/,677

Considering the lack of VR empirical research, the indirect effect of interactivity and vividness on perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment through telepresence and the moderating effect of consumer previous experience with VR are also included.Design/methodology/approachA commercial IKEA VR store was chosen for the study. Head-mounted display (HMD) VR headsets were employed for the VR shopping experience. The study was conducted at a laboratory at a large university in the southeastern United States. A total of 146 college students participated in the study.FindingsVividness had significant positive effects on perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment, which in turn influenced attitude towards VR and behavioral intentions. Interactivity did not have positive impacts on perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment. However, it indirectly affected perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment through telepresence. The findings also proved the moderating effect of consumer previous VR experience between interactivity and perceived usefulness and between interactivity and perceived enjoyment. The relationship between attitude and behavioral intentions was also positive.Originality/valueNotwithstanding the benefits of VR in relation to its utilitarian, hedonic, and behavioral values, little is known about consumers' responses towards the usage of VR as a shopping tool. The present study can be considered as a starting point in understanding the usefulness of VR from consumer and managerial perspectives. The findings of VR indicated in the study will help practitioners understand the urgency of adopting VR in a retail setting.","Jung-Hwan, Kim Kim Minjeong Park Minjung Yoo Jungmin",Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing,https://doi.org/10.1108/jrim-07-2020-0148,677

At 10 degrees C, the binding affinities of all four proteins to oligosaccharides from both bacterial strains are identical within experimental error, and the binding constants for octa- and dodecasaccharides are 1 x 10(6) M(-1) and 2 x 10(6) M(-1), proving that two O-antigen repeats are sufficient for lipopolysaccharide recognition by the tailspike. Equilibration with the oligosaccharides occurs rapidly, but the endorhamnosidase produces only one cleavage every 100 s at 10 degrees C or about 2 min(-1) at the bacterial growth temperature. Thus, movement of virions in the lipopolysaccharide layer before DNA injection may involve the release and rebinding of individual tailspikes rather than hydrolysis of the O-antigen.","Baxa, U; Steinbacher, S; Miller, S; Weintraub, A; Huber, R; Seckler, R",Biophys J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1233670/,677

190140,[Awake prone positioning in covid-19 patients].,2021-02-16,"Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV) is a coronavirus that induces an often fatal, systemic infection in cats. Various vaccines designed to prevent FIPV infection have been shown to exacerbate the disease, probably due to immune enhancement mediated by virus-specific immunoglobulins against the outer envelope (S) protein. An effective vaccine would be one that induces cell-mediated immunity without disease enhancing antibodies. In this report, we describe the use of a recombinant raccoon poxvirus that expresses the gene encoding the nucleocapsid protein of FIPV (rRCNV-FIPV N) as an effective vaccine against FIPV-induced disease. Cats were parenterally or orally vaccinated twice, three weeks apart. Cats were then orally challenged with Feline Enteric Coronavirus (FECV), which induces a subclinical infection that can cause enhancement of subsequent FIPV infection. Three weeks later, cats were orally challenged with FIPV. The FIPV challenge induced a fatal infection in 4/5 (80%) of the controls. On the other hand, all five cats vaccinated subcutaneously with rRCNV-FIPV N showed no signs of disease after challenge with FIPV. Four of the five subcutaneous vaccinates survived an additional FIPV challenge. Vaccination with rRCNV-FIPV N induced serum IgG antibody responses to FIPV nucleocapsid protein, but few, if any, FIPV neutralizing antibodies. In contrast to the controls, protected vaccinates maintained low FIPV serum neutralizing antibody titers after FIPV challenge. This suggests that the protective immune response involves a mechanism other than humoral immunity consisting of FIPV neutralizing antibodies.","Wasmoen, T L; Kadakia, N P; Unfer, R C; Fickbohm, B L; Cook, C P; Chu, H J; Acree, W M",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8830483/,677

Neutralizing antibody titers to BCV and BVDV were determined for 852 animals from 3 Ontario feedlots. Calves at 2 of the 3 feedlots (n = 753) received a modified live 4-way viral vaccine containing BVDV. On arrival at the feedlots, 90% of animals were seropositive for BCV, while 39% of animals were seropositive for BVDV. This evidence of previous exposure to both viruses was associated with reduced subsequent UBRD risk. Evidence of exposure to BCV during the study period was common, as 50% of animals showed a 16-fold or greater titer increase; however, treatment for UBRD was not associated with titer change. Although the majority of animals were vaccinated for BVDV at arrival, within a feedlot, animals treated for UBRD had larger titer increases to BVDV than non-treated animals. Based on our findings we infer that BCV was not causally related to UBRD occurrence, however consistent with other literature, BVDV may be causally related to UBRD occurrence.","O'Connor, A; Martin, S W; Nagy, E; Menzies, P; Harland, R",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11480517/,677

191221,A process evaluation of an intervention to improve respiratory infection control practices in family physician offices.,2006,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Acute oesophageal variceal haemorrhage (AOVH) is a medical emergency. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommended endoscopy management as soon as possible and not more than 12 hours after presentation. The United King guidelines recommended endoscopy for unstable patients with severe acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding immediately after resuscitation and within 24 hours of admission. The aim of the study is to evaluate the outcome of endoscopic management of AOVH in less than 12 hours compared to 12-24 hours post admission. METHODS We recruited 297 patients with AOVH. The patients were divided into groups depending on the timing of the endoscopic management: 180 within 12 h of admission and 117 patients at 12-24 hours of admission. Routine clinical and laboratory data were collected. RESULTS Compared to patients with endoscopic management at 12-24 hours (mean 16 hours), patients with endoscopic management within 12 hours (mean 8.3 hours) of admission had fewer hospital stay days (P= 0.001), significant reduction of ammonia levels (P< 0.0001) and significant improvement in associated hepatic encephalopathy grade (p=0.048). There were no major clinical vents in the <12 hour group, but 8 events in the 12-24 hour group (p<0.01). CONCLUSION Endoscopic management of acute esophageal variceal bleeding within 12 hours of admission is superior to endoscopic management at 12-24 hours of admission regarding, reduction of hospital stay, ammonia levels, correction of hepatic encephalopathy, re-bleeding and mortality rate, hence, reduce the cost of treatment, benefiting patient satisfaction and hospital bed availability.","Mousa, N; Abdel-Razik, A; Sheta, T; G Deiab, A; Habib, A; El-Diasty, M; Eldesoky, A; Taha, A; Mousa, E; Yassen, A; Fathy, A; Elgamal, A",British journal of biomedical science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305686/,677

Methods This is a single-center clinical trial of COVID-19 patients at NYU Winthrop Hospital from March 31 to April 28, 2020. Patients in this trial received hyperbaric oxygen therapy at 2.0 atmospheres of pressure in monoplace hyperbaric chambers for 90 minutes daily for a maximum of five total treatments. Controls were identified using propensity score matching among COVID-19 patients admitted during the same time period. Using competing-risks survival regression, we analyzed our primary outcome of inpatient mortality and secondary outcome of mechanical ventilation. Results We treated 20 COVID-19 patients with hyperbaric oxygen. Ages ranged from 30 to 79 years with an oxygen requirement ranging from 2 to 15 liters on hospital days 0 to 14. Of these 20 patients, two (10%) were intubated and died, and none remain hospitalized. Among 60 propensity-matched controls based on age, sex, body mass index, coronary artery disease, troponin, D-dimer, hospital day, and oxygen requirement, 18 (30%) were intubated, 13 (22%) have died, and three (5%) remain hospitalized (with one still requiring mechanical ventilation). Assuming no further deaths among controls, we estimate that the adjusted subdistribution hazard ratios were 0.37 for inpatient mortality (p=0.14) and 0.26 for mechanical ventilation (p=0.046). Conclusion Though limited by its study design, our results demonstrate the safety of hyperbaric oxygen among COVID-19 patients and strongly suggests the need for a well-designed, multicenter randomized control trial.","Gorenstein, Scott A; Castellano, Michael L; Slone, Eric S; Gillette, Brian; Liu, Helen; Alsamarraie, Cindy; Jacobson, Alan M; Wall, Stephen P; Adhikari, Samrachana; Swartz, Jordan L; McMullen, Jenica J S; Osorio, Marcela; Koziatek, Christian A; Lee, David C","Undersea & hyperbaric medicine : journal of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32931666/,677

The RT-LAMP assay reported in this study is very simple and rapid; the amplification can be obtained in 30 min under isothermal conditions at 63 degrees C by employing a set of six primers targeting the E gene of JEV. The RT-LAMP assay demonstrated exceptionally higher sensitivity compared to that of RT-PCR, with a detection limit of 0.1 PFU. The specificities of the selected primer sets were established by cross-reactivity studies with other closely related members of the JEV serocomplex as well as by evaluation of healthy human volunteers. The comparative evaluation of the RT-LAMP assay for clinical diagnosis with a limited number of patient cerebrospinal fluid samples revealed 85% concordance with conventional RT-PCR, with a sensitivity and a specificity of 100% and 86%, respectively. The concentration of virus in most of the clinical samples was 10(2) to 10(5) PFU/ml, as determined from the standard curve based on the time of positivity in the samples. In addition, the monitoring of gene amplification can also be visualized with the naked eye by using SYBR green I fluorescent dye. Thus, due to easy operation without a requirement of sophisticated equipment and skilled personnel, the RT-LAMP assay reported here is a valuable tool for the rapid and real-time detection of JEV not only by well-equipped laboratories but also by peripheral diagnostic laboratories with limited financial resources in developing countries.","Parida, M M; Santhosh, S R; Dash, P K; Tripathi, N K; Saxena, P; Ambuj, S; Sahni, A K; Lakshmana Rao, P V; Morita, Kouichi",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17005741/,677

195534,Stigmatization of newly emerging infectious diseases: AIDS and SARS.,2006,"We characterized a novel 28S rRNA cleavage in cells infected with the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). The 28S rRNA cleavage occurred as early as 4 h postinfection (p.i.) in MHV-infected DBT cells, with the appearance of subsequent cleavage products and a decrease in the amount of intact 28S rRNA with increasing times of infection; almost all of the intact 28S rRNA disappeared by 24 h p.i. In contrast, no specific 18S rRNA cleavage was detected in infected cells. MHV-induced 28S rRNA cleavage was detected in all MHV-susceptible cell lines and all MHV strains tested. MHV replication was required for the 28S rRNA cleavage, and mature cytoplasmic 28S rRNA underwent cleavage. In certain combination of cells and viruses, pretreatment of virus-infected cells with interferon activates a cellular endoribonuclease, RNase L, that causes rRNA degradation. No interferon was detected in the inoculum used for MHV infection. Addition of anti-interferon antibody to MHV-infected cells did not inhibit 28S rRNA cleavage. Furthermore, 28S rRNA cleavage occurred in an MHV-infected mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line derived from RNase L knockout mice. Thus, MHV-induced 28S rRNA cleavage was independent of the activation of RNase L. MHV-induced 28S rRNA cleavage was also different from apoptosis-related rRNA degradation, which usually occurs concomitantly with DNA fragmentation. In MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cells, 28S rRNA cleavage preceded DNA fragmentation by at least 18 h. Blockage of apoptosis in MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cells by treatment with a caspase inhibitor did not block 28S rRNA cleavage. Furthermore, MHV-induced 28S rRNA cleavage occurred in MHV-infected DBT cells that do not show apoptotic signs, including activation of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation. Thus, MHV-induced 28S rRNA cleavage appeared to differ from any rRNA degradation mechanism described previously.","Banerjee, S; An, S; Zhou, A; Silverman, R H; Makino, S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10982321/,677

We evaluated the occurrence of S-curves in patients presenting with acute strokes due to ICA steno-occlusive dissections. METHODS This was a retrospective review of the interventional databases of two academic tertiary-care institutions. The presence of ICA S-shaped curves, C-shaped curves, 360-degree loops, as well as classic FMD and atherosclerotic changes at the ICA bulb and curve/loop was determined. Cases of carotid dissections were compared with a control group (consecutive non-tandem anterior circulation strokes). RESULTS Twenty-four patients with carotid dissections were compared to 92 controls. Baseline characteristics and procedural variables were similar, with the exception of younger age, less frequent history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation and stent retriever use in patients with dissections. The rates of mTICI2b-3 reperfusion, parenchymal hematoma, good outcome and mortality were similar amongst groups. The frequency of S-curves (any side without superimposed atherosclerosis) was 29% in the dissection group versus 7% in controls (p < 0.01). S-curves were typically mirror images within the dissection group (85% had bilateral occurrence). The frequency of C-shaped and 360-degree curves was similar between groups. FMD changes within the craniocervical arteries were statistically more common in dissection patients. Ten patients (41%) of the dissection group had S-curves or classic FMD changes. Multivariate analysis indicated that S-curves were independently associated with the presence of dissections. CONCLUSION S-shaped ICA curves are predictably bilateral, highly associated with carotid dissections in patients with moderate to severe strokes, and may suggest an underlying presence of FMD.","Haussen, Diogo C; Jadhav, Ashutosh; Rebello, Leticia C; Belagaje, Samir; Anderson, Aaron; Jovin, Tudor; Aghaebrahim, Amin; Gulati, Deepak; Wells, Bryan; Frankel, Michael; Nogueira, Raul G",Interventional neurology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27781048/,677

Subsequently, an approximately 600 bp region of the PRRSV genome was tested for recombination by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Between 0.1 and 2.5% RNA recombination was found between the European isolates, but no recombination was detected between the European and North American types. Calculation of the maximum theoretical risk of European-American recombination, based on the sensitivity of the RT-PCR system, revealed that RNA recombination between the European and North American types of PRRSV is at least 10 000 times less likely to occur than RNA recombination between diverse European isolates.","van Vugt, J J; Storgaard, T; Oleksiewicz, M B; Bøtner, A",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11602772/,677

ISAV presumably represents a new genus within the Orthomyxoviridae. ISAV has been shown earlier to exhibit a receptor-destroying activity, which was defined as an acetylesterase with unknown specificity. We have analyzed the substrate specificity of the ISAV esterase in detail. Purified ISAV hydrolyzed free 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetyl neuraminic acid. In addition, the purified 9-O-acetylated sialic acid derivative was also hydrolyzed, but at lower rates. When we used a glycosidically bound substrate, ISAV was unable to hydrolyze 9-O-acetylated sialic acid, which represents the major substrate for the influenza C virus esterase. ISAV completely de-O-acetylated glycoprotein-bound 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetyl neuraminic acid. Thus, the enzymatic activity of the hemagglutinin-esterase of ISAV is comparable to that of the sialate-4-O-esterases of murine coronaviruses and related group 2 coronaviruses. In addition, we found that ISAV specifically binds to glycoproteins containing 4-O-acetylated sialic acids. Both the ISAV esterase and recombinant rat coronavirus esterase specific for 4-O-acetylated sialic acids hydrolyzed ISAV receptors on horse and rabbit erythrocytes, indicating that this sialic acid represents a receptor determinant for ISAV.","Hellebø, Audny; Vilas, Ulrike; Falk, Knut; Vlasak, Reinhard",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14990724/,677

We assessed the cellular and humoral immune response and infection by analyzing stool, serum, saliva, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) responses pre- and postchallenge. In contrast to Norwalk virus (NV), SMV infection was not dependent upon blood group secretor status. Nine of 15 volunteers were infected and showed a >/=4-fold increase over the prechallenge anti-SMV serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer, mostly subclass IgG1. Although serum IgG elicited by SMV infection was cross-reactive with Hawaii virus (HV), another genogroup 2 norovirus, salivary IgA was less cross-reactive. Neither SMV-elicited serum IgG nor salivary IgA cross-reacted with NV, a genogroup 1 norovirus.

For the majority of volunteers, both infected and uninfected, PBMCs stimulated with norovirus virus-like particles secreted IFN-gamma and other Th1 cytokines, suggesting previous norovirus exposure in most volunteers.

Mesh fixation in this plane is often achieved using transfascial sutures, which risks entrapping intercostal nerves and causing significant pain, and takes time to place. A novel alternative is the use of sutureless self-adhering mesh. Although the use of this mesh in inguinal hernias has been well described, studies on its use in abdominal wall reconstruction are lacking. METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent ventral hernia repair with retrorectus mesh were reviewed. This included patients who received transfascially sutured mesh and those who received sutureless self-adhering mesh. All patients were followed up for at least 12 months. The amount of narcotics required by each patient postoperatively was calculated. Surgical-site occurrences (SSOs) and hernia recurrence and bulge were measured. RESULTS Twenty-six patients underwent abdominal wall reconstruction with retrorectus mesh. This included 12 patients with transfascially sutured mesh and 14 patients with self-adhering mesh. Mean follow-up was 600 days. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Patients receiving self-adhering mesh required significantly less narcotics than patients with transfascially sutured mesh. There were no significant differences in the rate of SSOs between the 2 groups. No hernia recurrences, bulges, or chronic pain occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to compare the outcomes of retrorectus self-adhering mesh and transfascially sutured mesh in abdominal wall reconstruction. Our results show low rates of SSO, recurrence, and bulge with both options, with significantly less acute pain with self-adhering mesh.","Khansa, Ibrahim; Janis, Jeffrey E",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

203476,BAME excess deaths: chronic stress and constant hostility,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the immediate psychological effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on medical and non-medical students. METHODS: An online survey of 805 medical students and 1900 non-medical students was conducted from Feb 4, 2020 to Feb 7, 2020, in China. The questionnaire measured the subjective estimated severity of COVID-19, the impact of the outbreak, and the levels of anxiety and depression of both medical and non-medical students. RESULTS: Medical students estimated COVID-19 to be more serious and disastrous than non-medical students, while they scored lower than non-medical students on the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and less severe anxiety and depression than non-medical students. The students experienced greater impact from the outbreak and a higher rate of anxiety and depression with increased time focusing on the outbreak. The difference in psychological effects between medical and non-medical students was further enlarged when focusing time was prolonged. CONCLUSIONS: The immediate psychological effects of COVID-19 on medical and non-medical students exhibit different characteristics. The outcome of this study provides implication that providing accurate and transparent information about the epidemic and appropriate COVID-19-based knowledge in accessible ways will contribute to the public's mental health during the outbreak.","Xie, Lin; Luo, Hong; Li, Mei; Ge, Wenjie; Xing, Bingyu; Miao, Qunfang",Int J Public Health,,677

The objective of this study is to introduce how a group of vascular surgery residencies joined forces to improve surgical education in times of COVID-19. METHODS: On May 2020, a group of Hispanic American vascular residency programs created webinar sessions of arterial and venous clinical cases among vascular residents across Latin America and Europe. Participants were surveyed via email. Questions were about the perceived quality and utility of the webinars; answers were stratified into negative (disagree), neutral, and positive (agree). RESULTS: There have been 60 sessions and 118 clinical cases presented. The survey was answered by 106 participants, 82 males (78.8%) and 24 women (23.0%). Fifty-four (51.9%) were board-certified vascular surgeons, 49 (47.1%) vascular surgery residents, and 2 (1.9%) general surgery residents. Mean age of the participants was 41.5 years (range: 25-74 years). Mean years of vascular surgery practice or experience were 11.2 years (range: 0-45 years). The residency programs involved in this project were from 13 different countries. Most answers received were positive for both perceived quality and utility of the webinars. CONCLUSION: Globalization and technology provide an opportunity for international education, with the goal of building well-rounded and academic vascular surgeons. This group is just the beginning of a large collaborative group among Hispanic American countries, hoping that more residency programs will join, with the aim of breaking borders in the education of vascular surgery.","Fabiani, Mario Alejandro; Gonzalez-Urquijo, Mauricio; Cassagne, Gabriela; Dominguez, Angeles; Hinojosa-Gonzalez, David Eugenio; Lozano-Balderas, Gerardo; Cisneros Tinoco, Miguel Ángel; Escotto Sanchez, Ignacio; Esperón Percovich, Alejandro; Vegas, Diego Herrera; Mariné Massa, Leopoldo; Mertens, Renato A; Morelli, Luis; Sepulveda Monsalve, Gustavo; Sanchez Nicolat, Nora; Perez Damian, Venancio; Riambau, Vicente; Vaquero Puerta, Carlos; Zaefferer, Patricio",Vascular,,677

Bats possess an additional, innate ability for antiviral defense, and, on the other hand, the potential to go hand-in-hand with the virus to generate variability. Besides the high potential of the novel coronavirus in compromising the respiratory system, its rapid transmission and ability to engage many hosts in severe forms of infections or immunopathological complications make it a tough opponent for the immune system. The interactions between SARS-CoV2 and the host immune system result in unleashing tremendous amounts of cytokines, and these cytokines make a storm that would determine the outcome (recovery or death) of the lungs of the patient.","Nasab, Mahsa Golshani; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Arch Med Res,,677

According to WHO (World Health Organization)'s statements, breathing without a mask is highly dangerous in public and crowded places. Indeed, wearing masks reduces the chance of being infected, and detecting unmasked people is a waste of resources if not performed automatically. AI techniques are used to increase the detection speed of masked and unmasked faces. In this research, a novel dataset and two different methods are proposed to detect masked and unmasked faces in real-time. In the first method, an object detection model is applied to find and classify masked and unmasked faces. In the second method, a YOLO face detector spots faces (whether masked or not), and then the faces are classified into masked and unmasked categories with a novel fast yet effective CNN architecture.

One of the reasons for this major success is better use of big data analytics in efficient contact tracing and management and surveillance of those who require quarantine and isolation. OBJECTIVE: We present here a unique application of big data analytics among Taiwanese people who had contact with more than 3000 passengers that disembarked at Keelung harbor in Taiwan for a 1-day tour on January 31, 2020, 5 days before the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the Diamond Princess cruise ship on February 5, 2020, after an index case was identified on January 20, 2020. METHODS: The smart contact tracing-based mobile sensor data, cross-validated by other big sensor surveillance data, were analyzed by the mobile geopositioning method and rapid analysis to identify 627,386 potential contact-persons. Information on self-monitoring and self-quarantine was provided via SMS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests were offered for symptomatic contacts. National Health Insurance claims big data were linked, to follow-up on the outcome related to COVID-19 among those who were hospitalized due to pneumonia and advised to undergo screening for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: As of February 29, a total of 67 contacts who were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were all negative and no confirmed COVID-19 cases were found. Less cases of respiratory syndrome and pneumonia were found after the follow-up of the contact population compared with the general population until March 10, 2020.

For dental practices and hospitals in countries/regions that are (potentially) affected with COVID-19, strict and effective infection control protocols are urgently needed. Aim and objective: To investigate knowledge and perception of COVID-19 among pedodontists in India. Population and methods: A quick online cross-sectional study was conducted among 335 pedodontists in India. The questionnaire was sent to 410 pedodontists in India, out of those 335 responded. The study objective and questionnaire were sent to pedodontists via “Google Forms”. The collected data were sent for appropriate statistics. Results: Of the total participants, 82% of pedodontists think that children are silent carriers of COVID-19. Sixty-two percent of pedodontists say that it is very difficult to treat pediatric dental patients by use of a personal protective equipment (PPE) kit. Sixty-four percent of pedodontists will overcome this financial crisis by increasing working time and 36% of them by increasing the cost of treatment. Conclusion: The role of pedodontists in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 is critically important.

We investigated why RESs between AVA premotor interneurons and A-type cholinergic motoneurons (A-MNs) in Caenorhabditis elegans escape circuit conduct junctional currents (I j) only in the antidromic direction. These RESs consist of UNC-7 innexin in AVA and UNC-9 innexin in A-MNs. UNC-7 has multiple isoforms differing in the length and sequence of the amino terminus. In a heterologous expression system, only one UNC-7 isoform, UNC-7b, can form heterotypic gap junctions (GJs) with UNC-9 that strongly favor I j in the UNC-9 to UNC-7 direction. Knockout of unc-7b alone almost eliminated the I j, whereas AVA-specific expression of UNC-7b substantially rescued the coupling defect of unc-7 mutant. Neutralizing charged residues in UNC-7b amino terminus abolished the rectification property of UNC-7b/UNC-9 GJs. Our results suggest that the rectification property results from electrostatic interactions between charged residues in UNC-7b amino terminus.","Shui, Yuan; Liu, Ping; Zhan, Haiying; Chen, Bojun; Wang, Zhao-Wen",Sci.

Hormonal pathways play important roles in some cancers. This study investigated the association of CRC expression of neurotensin (NTS), NTS receptors 1 and 3 (NTSR1 and NTSR3) and clinical outcomes. Methods: A prospective cohort study which quantifies the protein expression of NTS, NTSR1 and NTSR3 in human CRCs using immunohistochemistry. Expression levels were then compared with clinico-pathological outcome including histological grade, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: Sixty-four patients were enrolled with median follow-up of 44.0 months. There was significantly higher expression of NTS in cancer tissue in CRC with higher T stages (p < 0.01), N stages (p = 0.03), and AJCC clinical stages (p = 0.04). There was significantly higher expression of NTS, NTSR1 and NTSR3 in cancer tissue compared to surrounding normal epithelium (median H-score 163.5 vs 97.3, p < 0.01). There was significantly shorter DFS in individuals with CRC with high levels of NTS compared to lower levels of NTS (35.8 months 95% CI 28.7-42.8 months vs 46.4 months 95% CI 42.2-50.5 months, respectively, p = 0.02). Above median NTS expression in cancer tissue was a significant risk factor for disease recurrence (HR 4.10, 95% CI 1.14-14.7, p = 0.03). Discussion: The expression of NTS and its receptors has the potential to be utilised as a predictive and prognostic marker in colorectal cancer for postoperative selection for adjuvant therapy and identify individuals for novel therapies targeting the neurotensinergic pathways. Conclusions: High NTS expression appears to be associated with more advanced CRC and worse DFS.","Qiu, Shengyang; Nikolaou, Stella; Zhu, Jie; Jeffery, Peter; Goldin, Robert; Kinross, James; Alexander, James L; Rasheed, Shahnawaz; Tekkis, Paris; Kontovounisios, Christos",Biomolecules,,677

We investigated 27 datasets with more than 270,000 messages, and the experiments showed that the population dynamics model is suitable for modeling the spread of information. The results revealed that information propagation could occur rapidly;after only 1–2 days. Additionally, we discovered that it is very crucial to find immediate solutions for preventing fake information as soon as it appears.

318819,The Adjacent Possible in Primary Care,2021,"Background and purpose - COVID-19 lockdowns have resulted in noteworthy changes in trauma admissions. We report and compare the incidence and characteristics of severe injuries (New Injury Severity Score [NISS] > 15) during the COVID-19 lockdown in Finland with earlier years. Methods - We retrospectively analyzed incidence rate, injury severity scores, injury patterns, and mechanisms of injury of all severely injured patients (NISS >15) in 4 Finnish hospitals (Tampere University Hospital, Kuopio University Hospital, Central Finland Hospital, Mikkeli Central Hospital) during the 11-week lockdown period (March 16-May 31, 2020) with comparison with a matching time period in earlier years (2016-2018). These 4 hospitals have a combined catchment area of 1,150,000 people or roughly one-fifth of the population of Finland. Results - The incidence rate of severe injuries during the lockdown period was 4.9/105 inhabitants (95% CI 3.7-6.4). The incidence rate of severe injuries during years 2016-2018 was 5.1/105 inhabitants (CI 3.9-6.5). We could not detect a significant incidence difference between the lockdown period and the 3 previous years (incidence rate difference -0.2 (CI -2.0 to 1.7). The proportion of traffic-related accidents was 55% during the lockdown period and 51% during previous years. There were no detectable differences in injury patterns. During the lockdown period, the mean age of patients was higher (53 years vs. 47 years, p = 0.03) and the rate of severely injured elderly patients (aged 70 or more) was higher (30% vs. 16%). Interpretation - Despite heavy social restrictions, the incidence of severe injuries during the lockdown period was similar to previous years. Notably, a decline in road use and traffic volumes did not reduce the number of severe traffic accidents. Although our data is compatible with a decrease of 2.0 to an increase of 1.7 severely injured patients per 105 inhabitants, we conclude that severely injured patients do not disappear even during pandemic and stabile hospital resources are needed to treat these patients.","Riuttanen, Antti; Ponkilainen, Ville; Kuitunen, Ilari; Reito, Aleksi; Sirola, Joonas; Mattila, Ville M",Acta Orthop,,677

324277,[Primary health care through the eyes of the general practitioner;an international study],2021,"Objective: SARS-CoV-2 has led to a rapidly spreading COVID-19 global pandemic. Since the putative receptor for the virus is identified in reproductive organs, it is important to examine if SARS-CoV-2 targets the human reproductive tract. And, if so, is COVID-19 a sexually transmitted disease (STD)? Evidence Review: A systematic review of English publications to December 11, 2020, was conducted in PubMed, NIH iCite COVID-19 portfolio, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases, searching for SARS-CoV-2 in testes, seminal, prostatic and vaginal fluids, and in cervical smears. 1,997 records were identified, duplicates were removed, and 1,490 records were reviewed for eligibility by examining titles and abstracts. 202 full-text relevant articles were reviewed by two independent reviewers. 47studies (literature reviews, editorials, and guidelines) were assessed qualitatively and 23 studies that tested the male and female reproductive tracts of COVID-19 patients for SARS-CoV-2 were quantitatively analyzed. Findings: No epidemiological investigations to date have described evidence suggesting that COVID-19 is an STD. While ACE2 receptor is found in reproductive organs, the lack of co-expression of the TMPRSS2 modulatory protein, required for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, in testicular cells, sperm, or oocytes, argues against the hypothesis that gametes transmit SARS-CoV-2. Molecular detection studies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the male and female reproductive tracts were summarized: 98.0% (293/299) of the seminal fluids, 16/17 testicular biopsies, all 89 prostatic fluids, 98.3% (57/58) of the vaginal fluids, all 35 cervical smears, and all 16 oocyte samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. None of the studies confirmed sexual transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Nonetheless, COVID-19 may have detrimental effects on male reproduction by inducing orchitis and/or decreasing testosterone levels, sperm counts, and motility. Conclusions: Based on the current worldwide published information, COVID-19 is not an STD. This information is important for clinicians, proposed guidelines for public health, FDA guidelines for gamete and tissue donor eligibility, and for fertility treatments. Universal precautions, currently practiced worldwide, are adequate and sufficient at this time to prevent the transmission of known or unknown viral infections. We suggest that recovered patients of COVID-19, especially those with infertility, should be evaluated for their ovarian and testicular function.","Tur-Kaspa, Ilan; Tur-Kaspa, Tomer; Hildebrand, Grace; Cohen, David",,,677
325853,Psychological stresses among Chinese university students during the COVID-19 epidemic: The effect of early life adversity on emotional distress,2021,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) invades the respiratory system, causing acute and sometimes severe pulmonary symptoms, but turned out to also act multisystematically with substantial impact on the brain. A growing number of studies suggests a diverse spectrum of neurological manifestations. To investigate the spectrum of symptoms, we here describe the neurological manifestations and complications of patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection who have been hospitalized at the RWTH University Hospital Aachen, Germany. METHODS: Between March and September 2020, we evaluated common symptoms, clinical characteristics, laboratory (including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis), radiological, and electroencephalography (EEG) data from 53 patients admitted with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA) to screen for cognitive impairment, when feasible. We compared critically ill and non-critically ill patients categorized according to the presence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). RESULTS: Major clinical neurological features of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were coordination deficits (74%), cognitive impairment (61.5%), paresis (47%), abnormal reflex status (45%), sensory abnormalities (45%), general muscle weakness and pain (32%), hyposmia (26%), and headache (21%). Patients with ARDS were more severely affected than non-ADRS patients. 29.6% of patients with ARDS presented with subarachnoid bleedings, and 11.1% showed ischemic stroke associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cognitive deficits mainly affected executive functions, attention, language, and delayed memory recall. We obtained cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by lumbar puncture in nine of the 53 patients, none of which had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. CONCLUSIONS: In line with previous findings, our results provide evidence for a range of SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological manifestations. 26% of patients reported hyposmia, emphasizing the neuro-invasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, which can enter the olfactory bulb. It can therefore be speculated that neurological manifestations may be caused by direct invasion of the virus in the CNS; however, PCR did not reveal positive intrathecal SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we hypothesize it is more likely that the para-infectious severe pro-inflammatory impact of COVID-19 is responsible for the neurological deficits including cognitive impairment. Future studies with comprehensive longitudinal assessment of neurological deficits are required to determine potential long-term complications of COVID-19.","Ermis, Ummehan; Rust, Marcus Immanuel; Bungenberg, Julia; Costa, Ana; Dreher, Michael; Balfanz, Paul; Marx, Gernot; Wiesmann, Martin; Reetz, Kathrin; Tauber, Simone C; Schulz, Jörg B",Neurol Res Pract,,677

337570,Charging for NHS care and its impact on maternal health,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Telepsychiatry can improve access to psychiatric services for those who otherwise cannot easily access care. Family physicians are gatekeepers to specialized care in Ontario, so it is essential to understand predictors relating to referrals to telepsychiatry to better plan services and increase telepsychiatry adoption. METHODS: This study used an annual retrospective cross-sectional study design to compare physicians who referred their patients to telepsychiatry each year from fiscal year (FY) 2008 to FY 2016. A 1-year (FY 2016) comparison of family physicians who referred to telepsychiatry (FPTs) compared to family physicians who did not refer to telepsychiatry (FPNTs) matched (1:2) by region was also conducted. Finally, we used statistical modeling to understand the predictors of referring to telepsychiatry among physicians. RESULTS: Between FY 2008 and FY 2016, the number of patients receiving telepsychiatry increased from 925 visits to 13,825 visits. Thirty-two percent of Ontario primary care physicians referred to telepsychiatry in 2016. Several characteristics were notably different between FPTs and FPNTs: FPTs were more likely to be from a residence with less than 10,000 people, to have more nurse practitioners in the practice, and to be from a family health team than FPNTs. Rostered patients of FPTs were more likely to reside in rural areas, have more clinical complexity, and to utilize more mental health services compared to FPNTs. CONCLUSIONS: There has been an increase in the use of telepsychiatry by patients and family physicians over the study period, although there remains opportunity for significant growth. Family physicians who live in rural areas, are part of an FHT, have more NPs, with more rural and complex patients were more likely to refer to telepsychiatry. As recent pro-telemedicine policies support the growth of telepsychiatry, this study will serve as an important baseline.","Serhal, Eva; Iwajomo, Tomisin; de Oliveira, Claire; Crawford, Allison; Kurdyak, Paul",Can J Psychiatry,,677

342983,Before I go,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Viral pneumonia is the most relevant clinical presentation of COVID-19 which may lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome and even death. Eosinopenia was often noticed in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, but its role is poorly investigated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and eosinopenia. METHODS: We revised the records of consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our ER-COVID-19 area in order to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with and without eosinopenia. We considered the following clinical outcomes: 4-weeks survival; need for intensive respiratory support; and hospital discharge. RESULTS: Out of first 107 consecutive patients with pneumonia and a positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab, 75 patients showed undetectable eosinophil count (absolute eosinopenia). At 4 weeks, 38 patients (38.4%) had required intensive respiratory treatment, 25 (23.4%) deceased and 42 (39.2%) were discharged. Compared with patients without absolute eosinopenia, patients with absolute eosinopenia showed higher need of intensive respiratory treatment (49.3% vs 13.3%, P < .001), higher mortality (30.6% vs 6.2%, P .006) and lower rate of hospital discharge (28% vs 65.6%, P < .001). Binary logistic regression analyses including neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil, basophil and monocyte counts showed that absolute eosinopenia was an independent factor associated with 4-weeks mortality, need for intensive respiratory support and hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Absolute eosinopenia is associated with clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and might be used as a marker to discriminate patients with unfavourable prognosis.","Cazzaniga, Massimo; Fumagalli, Luca A M; D039,; angelo, Luciano; Cerino, Mario; Bonfanti, Giulia; Fumagalli, Riccardo M; Schiavo, Gianpaolo; Lorini, Cristina; Lainu, Elisa; Terragni, Sabina; Chiarelli, Marco; Scarazzati, Claudio; Bonato, Claudio; Zago, Mauro",Int J Clin Pract,,677
343090,Pre-registration nursing students' provision of safe care - are we leaving too much to chance?,2020,"Corona virus disease was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and is spreading across the world in an alarming fashion. To contain the spread, it is very important to identify the subtle/not readily apparent symptoms of COVID-19 at the earliest. The aim of the study is to determine the incidence duration progress of sino-nasal symptoms in COV 2 positive patients using SNAQ scoring. Patients who tested positive for SARS-COV 2 by RT-PCR and admitted in our hospital under category A (n = 382) were included in the study. A detailed history was collected from all the patients and sino-nasal assessment questionnaire (SNAQ) was provided to the patient with complaints of sinonasal symptoms and they were asked to fill the forms on day 3, 7 and 14. To identify the characteristics of sinonasal symptoms in COVID-19 patients with a history of smoking, smoking history was also collected in detail and patients were classified based on Brinkman's index into mild, moderate and severe smokers. In this study, the incidence of sinonasal symptoms was 24%. Average SNAQ scoring on day 3 was 30.09 and on day 7 was 12.9 and day 14 is 3.8. There was a decline in score on day 7 compared to day 3 indicating symptoms decrease by day7. Average SNAQ scoring in non-smokers and mild and moderate smokers was 20.18, 34.11, 57.5 respectively. The SNAQ scoring in smokers was more than that of non-smokers and was also persistent for a longer duration compared to non-smokers. Sino-nasal symptoms catch our eye because it is an important route for transmission. Viral shedding from sinonasal tract may be an important source for transmission. History and degree of smoking should also be considered while dividing COVID-19 patients into categories.","Meenakshi, M; Raj, K Deepak; Nandhini, R",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,677
343194,Covid-19: Risk of ocular transmission in health care professionals,2021,"Nowadays, nanoscale materials have been widely applied in the removal of contaminants from water system. Reduction of Cr(VI) (as a poisonous species) to Cr(III) (as a slight toxic species) was performed using CuO-Kaolin with ultrasound (US) irradiation. The CuO-Kaolin nanocomposites were synthesized via a facile coprecipitation method. Then X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses were performed to identify the structural features of CuO-Kaolin. The role of influential parameters for the reduction of Cr(VI) was investigated in sonocatalytic advanced oxidation system. 89.35% of Cr(VI) was removed via US/CuO-Kaolin process after 90 min at optimum conditions (pH= 3, sonocatalyst dosage= 1 g L-1 and [Cr (VI)]0= 20 mg L-1). This outstanding result was due to the synergistic effect of the increased electron delivery to conduction band on CuO-Kaolin nanocomposite and the increased reactive surface region of nanoparticles by sonication. The presence of H2O2 as an amplifier improved the removal efficiency of Cr(VI) from 89.35 to 100% after 20 min. Kinetic experimental results were well described by a pseudo first-order kinetic model. Desorption experiments showed an excellent stability of sonocatalyst during the reaction and maintenance of the catalytic activity up to 10 sequential cycles.","Ayagh, Kobra; Farrokhi, Mehrdad; Yang, Jae-Kyu; Shirzad-Siboni, Mehdi",Environ Technol,,677
347852,US elections and a foreign policy for pandemics,2020,"The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has deeply challenged the world population, but also our medical knowledge. Special attention has been paid early to an activation of coagulation, then to an elevated rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. These data suggested that anticoagulant drugs should be evaluated in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. The publication of unexpected high rates of VTE in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, despite receiving thromboprophylaxis, open the way to dedicated trials, evaluating modified regimens of thromboprophylaxis. Moreover, the further improvement in our comprehension of the disease, particularly the pulmonary endothelial dysfunction increased the hope that anticoagulant drugs may also protect patients from pulmonary thrombosis. In this comprehensive review, we cover the different situations where thromboprophylaxis standard may be modified (medically-ill inpatients, ICU inpatients, outpatients), and describe some of the current randomized controls trials evaluating new regimens of thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19, including the preliminary available results. We also discuss the potential of anticoagulant drugs to target the thromboinflammation described in patients with severe COVID-19.","Bertoletti, Laurent; Bikdeli, Behnood; Zuily, Stéphane; Blondon, Marc; Mismetti, Patrick",Vascul Pharmacol,,677

356088,"Yonder: Exercise procrastination, Tourette syndrome, breastfeeding, television deaths, and podcast of the month",2020,"Variation in the nucleotides of a codon may cause variations in the evolutionary patterns of a DNA or amino acid sequence. To address the capability of each position of a codon to have non-synonymous mutations, the concept of degree of mutation has been introduced. The degree of mutation of a particular position of codon defines the number of non-synonymous mutations occurring for the substitution of nucleotides at each position of a codon, when other two positions of that codon remain unaltered. A Cellular Automaton (CA), is used as a tool to model the mutations of any one of the four DNA bases A, C, T and G at a time where the DNA bases correspond to the states of the CA cells. Point mutation (substitution type) of a codon which characterizes changes in the amino acids, have been associated with local transition rules of a CA. Though there can be [Formula] transitions of a 4-state CA with 3-neighbourhood cells, here it has been possible to represent all possible point mutations of a codon in terms of combinations of 16 local transition functions of the CA. Further these rules are divided into 4 classes of equivalence. Also, according to the nature of mutations, the 16 local CA rules of substitutions are classified into 3 sets namely, No Mutation, Transition and Transversion. The experiment has been carried out with three sets of single nucleotide variations(SNVs) of three different viruses but the symptoms of the diseases caused by them are to some extent similar to each other. They are SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 Type A viruses. The aim is to understand the impact of nucleotide substitutions at different positions of a codon with respect to a particular disease phenotype.","Sengupta, Antara; Ghosh, Sreeya; Choudhury, Pabitra Pal",,,677

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to examine longitudinal trends in hospitalizations for acute cardiovascular conditions across a tertiary care health system. METHODS: Acute cardiovascular hospitalizations were tracked between January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020. Daily hospitalization rates were estimated using negative binomial models. Temporal trends in hospitalization rates were compared across the first 3 months of 2020, with the first 3 months of 2019 as a reference. RESULTS: From January 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020, 6,083 patients experienced 7,187 hospitalizations for primary acute cardiovascular reasons. There were 43.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27.4% to 56.0%) fewer estimated daily hospitalizations in March 2020 compared with March 2019 (p < 0.001). The daily rate of hospitalizations did not change throughout 2019 (-0.01% per day [95% CI: -0.04% to +0.02%]; p = 0.50), January 2020 (-0.5% per day [95% CI: -1.6% to +0.5%]; p = 0.31), or February 2020 (+0.7% per day [95% CI: -0.6% to +2.0%]; p = 0.27). There was significant daily decline in hospitalizations in March 2020 (-5.9% per day [95% CI: -7.6% to -4.3%]; p < 0.001). Length of stay was shorter (4.8 days [25th to 75th percentiles: 2.4 to 8.3 days] vs. 6.0 days [25th to 75th percentiles: 3.1 to 9.6 days]; p = 0.003) and in-hospital mortality was not significantly different (6.2% vs. 4.4%; p = 0.30) in March 2020 compared with March 2019. CONCLUSIONS: During the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a marked decline in acute cardiovascular hospitalizations, and patients who were admitted had shorter lengths of stay. These data substantiate concerns that acute care of cardiovascular conditions may be delayed, deferred, or abbreviated during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bhatt, Ankeet S; Moscone, Alea; McElrath, Erin E; Varshney, Anubodh S; Claggett, Brian L; Bhatt, Deepak L; Januzzi, James L; Butler, Javed; Adler, Dale S; Solomon, Scott D; Vaduganathan, Muthiah",J Am Coll Cardiol,,677

The objectives of this study are 1) to estimate the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19 reflecting the infectiousness of the virus and 2) to assess the effectiveness of a range of controlling intervention. Methods: The reported number of daily confirmed cases from January 17 to February 8, 2020 in Hubei province were collected and used for model fit. Four methods, the exponential growth (EG), maximum likelihood estimation (ML), sequential Bayesian method (SB) and time dependent reproduction numbers (TD), were applied to estimate the R(0). Results: Among the four methods, the EG method fitted the data best. The estimated R(0) was 3.49 (95%CI: 3.42-3.58) by using EG method. The R(0) was estimated to be 2.95 (95%CI: 2.86-3.03) after taking control measures. Conclusions: In the early stage of the epidemic, it is appropriate to estimate R(0) using the EG method.

RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 has high morbidity and mortality for transplant candidates; interestingly, posttransplant comorbidities play a larger role than immunosuppression status. COVID-19 therapies and vaccinations are well tolerated in pre and postliver transplant patients with few exceptions, although further research is needed regarding effectiveness in this patient population. Provider practice patterns should evolve to minimize contagion during the current pandemic and prepare for an increase in liver disease due to after-shocks of missed diagnosis and progression of liver disease. SUMMARY: COVID-19 has spurred new research and technologies to ensure the safety of liver transplant candidates, recipients, and donors, and most COVID-19 therapies are safe in this patient population.

380687,The Influence of Telemedicine Care on the Management of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms in Dementia (BPSD) Risk Factors Induced or Exacerbated During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"On March 15, 2020, the Dutch Government implemented COVID-19 lockdown measures. Although self-quarantine and social-distancing measures were implemented, restrictions were less severe compared to several other countries. The aim of this study was to assess changes in eating behavior and food purchases among a representative adult sample in the Netherlands (n = 1030), five weeks into lockdown. The results show that most participants did not change their eating behaviors (83.0%) or food purchases (73.3%). However, socio-demographic differences were observed among those that reported changes during lockdown. For example, participants with overweight (OR = 2.26, 95%CI = 1.24-4.11) and obesity (OR = 4.21, 95%CI = 2.13-8.32) were more likely to indicate to eat unhealthier during lockdown compared to participants with a healthy weight. Those with a high educational level (OR = 2.25, 95%-CI = 1.03-4.93) were also more likely to indicate to eat unhealthier during lockdown compared to those with a low educational level. Older participants were more likely to indicate to experience no differences in their eating behaviors compared to those of younger age, who were more likely to indicate that they ate healthier (OR = 1.03, 95%CI = 1.01-1.04) as well as unhealthier (OR = 1.04, 95%CI = 1.02-1.06) during lockdown. Participants with obesity were more likely to indicate to purchase more chips/snacks (OR = 2.79, 95%CI = 1.43-5.45) and more nonalcoholic beverages (OR = 2.74, 95%CI = 1.36-5.50) during lockdown in comparison with those with a healthy weight. Of those that used meal delivery services before, 174 (29.5%) indicated to use meal delivery services more frequently during lockdown. Although the results confirm the persistence of dietary routines, profound socio-demographic differences were observed for those that did report changes.

The recent unprecedented surge of CAM in India has drawn worldwide attention. More than 28,252 mucormycosis cases are counted and India is the first country where mucormycosis has been declared a notifiable disease. However, misconception of management, diagnosing and treating this infection continue to occur. Thus, European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) and the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) felt the need to address clinical management of CAM in low- and middle-income countries. This article provides a comprehensive document to help clinicians in managing this infection. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and inappropriate (high dose or not indicated) corticosteroid use are the major predisposing factors for this surge. High counts of Mucorales spores in both the indoor and outdoor environments, and the immunosuppressive impact of COVID-19 patients as well as immunotherapy are possible additional factors. Furthermore, a hyperglycaemic state leads to an increased expression of glucose regulated protein (GRP- 78) in endothelial cells that may help the entry of Mucorales into tissues. Rhino-orbital mucormycosis is the most common presentation followed by pulmonary mucormycosis. Recommendations are focused on the early suspicion of the disease and confirmation of diagnosis. Regarding management, glycaemic control, elimination of corticosteroid therapy, extensive surgical debridement and antifungal therapy are the standards for proper care. Due to limited availability of amphotericin B formulations during the present epidemic, alternative antifungal therapies are also discussed.","Rudramurthy, Shivaprakash M; Hoenigl, Martin; Meis, Jacques F; Cornely, Oliver A; Muthu, Valliappan; Gangneux, Jean Pierre; Perfect, John; Chakrabarti, Arunaloke",Mycoses,,677

METHODS: The electronic search was made using PubMed, Scopus, CENTRAL, and Google scholar to identify the retrospective observational reports. The studies published from 01 January 2020 to 30th October 2020. Participants were hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Interventions included tocilizumab versus placebo/standard of care. The comparison will be between TCZ versus standard of care (SOC)/placebo. Inconsistency between the studies was evaluated with I2 and quality of the evidences were evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS: Based on the inclusion criteria there were 24 retrospective studies involving 5686 subjects were included. The outcomes of the meta-analysis have revealed that the TCZ has reduced mortality (M-H, RE-OR -0.11(-0.18--0.04) 95% CI, p=0.001, I2 =88%) and increased the incidences of super-infections (M-H, RE-OR 1.49(1.13-1.96) 95% CI, p=0.004, I2=47%). However, there is no significant difference in ICU admissions rate (M-H, RE-OR -0.06(-0.23-0.12), I2=93%), need for mechanical ventilation (M-H, RE-OR of 0.00(-0.06-0.07), I=74%), LOS (IV -2.86(-0.91-3.38), I2=100%), LOS-ICU (IV: -3.93(-12.35-4.48), I2=100%), and incidences of pulmonary thrombosis (MH, RE-OR 1.01 (0.45-2.26), I2=0%) compared to SOC/control. CONCLUSIONS: Based on cumulative low-to-moderate certainty evidence shows that TCZ could reduce the risk of mortality in hospitalised patients.

These drugs block formation of the nodosome. The studies were prompted by the observation that infection of human fetal brain cells with Zika virus (ZIKV) induces expression of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2), a host factor that was found to promote ZIKV replication and spread. A drug that targets NOD2 was shown to have potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other flaviviruses, alphaviruses, enteroviruses, and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Another drug that inhibits the receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) which functions downstream of NOD2, also decreased replication of these pathogenic RNA viruses. The antiviral effect of this drug was particularly potent against enteroviruses. The broad-spectrum action of nodosome targeting drugs is mediated in part by enhancement of the interferon response. Together, these results suggest that further preclinical investigation of nodosome inhibitors as potential broad-spectrum antivirals is warranted.","Limonta, Daniel; Dyna-Dagman, Lovely; Branton, William; Mancinelli, Valeria; Makio, Tadashi; Wozniak, Richard W; Power, Christopher; Hobman, Tom C",,,677

Differences in how leaders address the pandemic through public messages have practical implications for building trust and an effective response within a country. METHODS: We analysed the speeches made by 20 heads of government around the world (Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Scotland, Sint Maarten, United Kingdom, United States and Taiwan) to highlight the differences between men and women leaders in discussing COVID-19. We used an inductive analytical approach, coding speeches for specific themes based on language and content. FINDINGS: Five primary themes emerged across a total of 122 speeches on COVID-19, made by heads of government: economics and financial relief, social welfare and vulnerable populations, nationalism, responsibility and paternalism, and emotional appeals. While all leaders described the economic impact of the pandemic, women spoke more frequently about the impact on the individual scale. Women leaders were also more often found describing a wider range of social welfare services, including: mental health, substance abuse and domestic violence. Both men and women from lower-resource settings described detailed financial relief and social welfare support that would impact the majority of their populations. While 17 of the 20 leaders used war metaphors to describe COVID-19 and the response, men largely used these with greater volume and frequency. CONCLUSION: While this analysis does not attempt to answer whether men or women are more effective leaders in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, it does provide insight into the rhetorical tools and types of language used by different leaders during a national and international crisis. This analysis provides additional evidence on the differences in political leaders' messages and priorities to inspire citizens' adhesion to the social contract in the adoption of response and recovery measures. However, it does not consider the influence of contexts, such as the public audience, on leaders' strategic communication approaches.","Dada, Sara; Ashworth, Henry Charles; Bewa, Marlene Joannie; Dhatt, Roopa",,,677

464965,"Adequate, reliable and timely information in times of the COVID-19 pandemic",2020,"SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and resulted in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Several animal models have been rapidly developed that recapitulate the asymptomatic to moderate disease spectrum. Now, there is a direct need for additional small animal models to study the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and for fast-tracked medical countermeasure development. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) under a cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that infection resulted in a dose-dependent lethal disease course. After inoculation with either 104 TCID50 or 105 TCID50, the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in rapid weight loss in both groups and uniform lethality in the 105 TCID50 group. High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes, were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI. The rapid inflammatory response and observed pathology bears resemblance to COVID-19. Additionally, we demonstrate that a mild disease course can be simulated by low dose infection with 102 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2, resulting in minimal clinical manifestation and near uniform survival. Taken together, these data support future application of this model to studies of pathogenesis and medical countermeasure development.","Yinda, Claude Kwe; Port, Julia R; Bushmaker, Trenton; Offei Owusu, Irene; Purushotham, Jyothi N; Avanzato, Victoria A; Fischer, Robert J; Schulz, Jonathan E; Holbrook, Myndi G; Hebner, Madison J; Rosenke, Rebecca; Thomas, Tina; Marzi, Andrea; Best, Sonja M; de Wit, Emmie; Shaia, Carl; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Munster, Vincent J",PLoS Pathog,,677

Multiple bacterial factors are known to contribute to persistent colonization of this niche, and many are important in mucosal immunity and vaccine development. In this work, mice were infected intranasally with transcriptional regulator mutants of the Rgg2/3 quorum sensing (QS) system-a peptide-based signaling system conserved in sequenced isolates of S. pyogenes Deletion of the QS system's transcriptional activator (&#916;rgg2) dramatically diminished the percentage of colonized mice while deletion of the transcriptional repressor (&#916;rgg3) increased the percentage of colonized mice compared to wild type. Stimulation of the QS system using synthetic pheromones prior to inoculation did not significantly increase the percentage of animals colonized, indicating that QS-dependent colonization is responsive to the intrinsic conditions within the host upper respiratory tract. Bacterial RNA extracted directly from oropharyngeal swabs and evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR subsequently confirmed QS upregulation within one hour of inoculation. In the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), a muted inflammatory response to the &#916;rgg2 bacteria suggests that their rapid elimination failed to elicit the previously characterized response to intranasal inoculation of GAS. This work identifies a new transcriptional regulatory system governing the ability of S. pyogenes to colonize the nasopharynx and provides knowledge that could help lead to decolonization therapeutics.","Gogos, Artemis; Federle, Michael J",Infect. immun,,677

488772,Comprehensive Evaluation on Emergency Response Capacity of Urban Public Health Emergencies: A Case Study of Zhejiang Province,2020,"COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading all over the world, creating the risk for a healthcare collapse. While acute care and intensive care units are the main pillars of the early response to the disease, rehabilitative medicine should play an important part in allowing COVID-19 survivors to reduce disability and optimize the function of acute hospital setting. The aim of this study was to share the experience and the international perspective of different rehabilitation centers, treating COVID-19 survivors. A group of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation specialists from eleven different countries in Europe and North America have shared their clinical experience in dealing with COVID-19 survivors and how they have managed the re-organization of rehabilitation services. In our experience the most important sequelae of severe and critical forms of COVID-19 are: 1) respiratory; 2) cognitive, central and peripheral nervous system; 3) deconditioning; 4) critical illness related myopathy and neuropathy; 5) dysphagia; 6) joint stiffness and pain; 7) psychiatric. We analyze all these consequences and propose some practical treatment options, based on current evidence and clinical experience, as well as several suggestions for management of rehabilitation services and patients with suspected or confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 survivors have some specific rehabilitation needs. Experience from other centers may help colleagues in organizing their services and providing better care to their patients.","Carda, Stefano; Invernizzi, Marco; Bavikatte, Ganesh; Bensmaïl, Djamel; Bianchi, Francesca; Deltombe, Thierry; Draulans, Nathalie; Esquenazi, Alberto; Francisco, Gerard E; Gross, Raphaël; Jacinto, Luis J; Moraleda Pérez, Susana; O039,; dell, Michael W; Reebye, Rajiv; Verduzco-Gutierrez, Monica; Wissel, Jörg; Molteni, Franco",Eur J Phys Rehabil Med,,677

The aim of this study was to compare the relationship between nutrition and life satisfaction of football players in the COVID-19 period and to evaluate with various variables. Methods: The research was conducted with 306 male players who actively played football in various clubs in the city center of Izmir between 2020 and 2021. The data were collected by using a personal information form, a three-factor nutrition questionnaire, and a life satisfaction scale. Results: The total scores of the life satisfaction scale differ significantly according to the age groups, income levels, future expectations, and loneliness levels of the football players (p&lt;0.05). The total scores of the life satisfaction scale differ significantly according to their body mass index (BMI) groups, licensed football seniority, and their future expectations (p&gt;0.05). The “4-Factor Nutrition Questionnaire” and subscale total scores of the football players do not differ significantly in terms of loneliness level, age, licensed football seniority, level of income, and level of loneliness (p &gt; 0.05). There is no relationship between the life satisfaction scale of individuals and the subscales of the Nutrition scale (p&gt;0.05). There is a statistically significant positive correlation between the total scores of the “Life Satisfaction Scale” and the “4 Factor Nutrition Questionnaire” (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: The more people enjoy life and the happier they are in life, the higher their life satisfaction will be. The diet of individuals with high life satisfaction is regular and they eat regularly. Individuals who are healthy and do not have psychological problems have high life satisfaction and healthy nutrition.","Balyan, M.; Zekioğlu, A.; Başoğlu, U.

Parallel advancements made in microprocessor-based electronics and database software can be combined to create robust, versatile and modular experimental monitoring systems. Here, we describe a monitoring network used across a number of cold atom laboratories with a shared laser system. The ability to diagnose malfunction, unexpected or unintended behaviour and passively collect data for key experimental parameters, such as vacuum chamber pressure, laser beam power, or resistances of important conductors, significantly reduces debugging time. This allows for efficient control over a number of experiments and remote control when access is limited.","Barrett, T.

The COVID-19 outbreak is currently responsible for major educational crises globally as most of the world has been faced with a mandated lockdown, and forced closure of educational institutions, including medical colleges. Anatomists have therefore been challenged to unlock technology in effort to achieve best deliverables for their discipline, without the use of traditional teaching aids such as the cadaver, osteological banks, prosected specimens, models, and microscopic slides. At present, the virtual classroom is the only option for the anatomist, thereby omitting vital aspects of the hidden curriculum such as ethical-reasoning, empathy, respect, professionalism, interpersonal, and communication skills. As body donations dwindle, the era of teaching in a cadaverless environment is upon us. This marks the beginning of a paradigm shift in education and research for anatomists worldwide. Given the variable pathological-morphological presentation in COVID-19-related deaths, it is also likely that the autopsy component of anatomic pathology will be resuscitated to demystify the underlying mechanisms of the virus. Since COVID-19 may never disappear completely, we would like to recommend that international anatomical societies collectively reach out to statutory bodies to devise a standardized method of teaching anatomy, employing readily available cost-effective resources, in the face of pandemics. However, if anatomy as a discipline has survived a millennium, surely anatomists can fight the “scourges” that have plagued them as various perspectives have been bandied about to welcome in a new normal.","Naidoo, N.; Satyapal, K.

608174,General practice in the years ahead: relationships will matter more than ever,2021,"Since the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the question regarding the efficacy of various hygiene measures and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) has become the focus of scientific and above all public discussion. To compare respirators, medical face masks, and cloth masks and determine if it is recommendable to wear face masks to protect the individual wearer of the mask from inhaling airborne particles, we challenged 29 different masks with aerosols and tested the pressure drop as a surrogate for breathing resistance owing to the mask material. We found that Type II medical face masks showed the lowest pressure drop (12.9±6.8 Pa/cm(2)) and therefore additional breathing resistance, whereas respirators such as the KN95 (32.3±7.0 Pa/cm(2)) and FFP2 (26.8±7.4 Pa/cm(2)) showed the highest pressure drops among the tested masks. The filtration efficacy of the mask material was the lowest for cloth masks (28±25%) followed by non-certified face masks (63±19%) and certified medical face masks (70±10%). The materials of the different respirators showed very high aerosol retentions (KN95 [94±4%] and FFP2 [98±1%]). For evaluating the as-worn filtration performance simulating real live conditions each mask type was also tested on a standardized dummy head. Cloth masks and non-EN-certified face masks had the worst as-worn filtration efficacies among the tested masks, filtering less than 20% of the test aerosol. Remarkably, certified type II medical face masks showed similar (p>0.5) as-worn filtration results (47±20%) than KN95 masks (41±4%) and FFP2 masks (65±27%), despite having a lower pressure drop. Face shields did not show any significant retention function against aerosols in our experiment. Our results indicate that it seems recommendable to wear face masks for providing base protection and risk reduction against inhaling airborne particles, in low-risk situations. In our study, especially EN 14683 type II certified medical face masks showed protective effectiveness against aerosols accompanied by minimal additional breathing resistance. FFP2 Respirators, on the other hand, could be useful in high-risk situations but require greater breathing effort and therefore physical stress for users.","Sterr, Christian M.; Nickel, Inga-Lena; Stranzinger, Christina; Nonnenmacher-Winter, Claudia I.; Günther, Frank",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33657178/,677

However, thus far, only a few studies have been published regarding the diet and activity of children and adolescents. The aim of the present study was to analyze the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and remote education in this period on the diet and physical activity in a Polish population-based sample of primary school adolescents. In June 2020, the Diet and Activity of Youth during COVID-19 (DAY-19) Study was conducted on a population recruited based on stratified random sampling from all regions (schools sampled from counties, and counties from voivodeships). The sample consisted of a total of 1334 adolescents aged 10–16 years. The study assessed the diet and physical activity of the participants using a validated questionnaire which included questions about the period of remote education and the period before the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants were asked about the following: consumption of fruit, vegetables, soft drinks, water, French fries, and fast food; eating meals in front of the television; and the number of days they are physically active and the number of hours they spend watching television. The obtained data were analyzed by stratifying the respondents by the gender, age, size of the city and total COVID-19 morbidity in the voivodeship. It was observed that, during the pandemic and the resultant remote education, the proportion of respondents who declared the recommended intake of fruits and vegetables had increased compared to that before the pandemic—a higher proportion consumed at least three portions of fruit per day (19.0% before pandemic vs. 27.4% during pandemic; p < 0.0001), as well as three and four or more portions of vegetables per day (11.9% vs. 14.5% and 7.5% vs. 11.1%; p = 0.0004). At the same time, the proportion of respondents consuming at least three cups of water per day had increased (41.1% vs. 47.9%; p = 0.0020), whereas the proportion of respondents who never or rarely eat their meals in front of the television had decreased (35.6% vs. 28.9%; p < 0.0001), and the proportion watching television for more than 2 h a day had increased (78.3% vs. 88.4%; p < 0.0001). Based on the results, it may be concluded that, during the period of remote education due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the dietary behaviors of the studied population of Polish adolescents were more beneficial, which included a higher intake of fruit, vegetables, and water, compared to before the pandemic.

656149,Quarantine Through History,2008-08-26,"All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) is the essential derivative of vitamin A and is of interest due to its various biological key functions. As shown in the recent literature, atRA also plays a role in the failing heart during myocardial infarction, the leading cause of death globally. To date insufficient mechanistic information has been available on related hypoxia-induced cell damage and reperfusion injuries. However, it has been demonstrated that a reduction in cellular atRA uptake abrogates hypoxia-mediated cell and tissue damage, which may offer a new route for intervention. Consequently, in this study, the effect of the novel cardio-protective compound 5-methoxyleoligin (5ML) on cellular atRA uptake was tested in human umbilical-vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). For this purpose, a high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method was developed to assess intra-cellular levels of the active substance and corresponding levels of vitamin A and its derivatives, including potential cis/trans isomers. This work also focused on light-induced isomerization and the stability of biological sample material to ensure sample integrity and avoid biased conclusions. This study provides evidence of the inhibitory effect of 5ML on cellular atRA uptake, a promising step toward a novel therapy for myocardial infarction.","Guntner, Armin Sebastian; Doppler, Christian; Wechselberger, Christian; Bernhard, David; Buchberger, Wolfgang",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9092048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911794/,677

683082,Epidemic Investigation,2008-08-26,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a respiratory viral infection with unique features including a more chronic course and systemic disease manifestations including multiple organ involvement; and there are differences in disease severity between ethnic groups. The immunological basis for disease has not been fully characterised. Analysis of whole-blood RNA expression may provide valuable information on disease pathogenesis. METHODS: We studied 45 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection within 10 days from onset of illness and a control group of 19 asymptomatic healthy volunteers with no known exposure to COVID-19 in the previous 14 days. Relevant demographic and clinical information was collected and a blood sample was drawn from all participants for whole-blood RNA sequencing. We evaluated differentially-expressed genes in COVID-19 patients (log2 fold change ≥ 1 versus healthy controls; false-discovery rate < 0.05) and associated protein pathways and compared these to published whole-blood signatures for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza. We developed a disease score reflecting the overall magnitude of expression of internally-validated genes and assessed the relationship between the disease score and clinical disease parameters. RESULTS: We found 135 differentially-expressed genes in the patients with COVID-19 (median age 35 years; 82% male; 36% Chinese, 53% South Asian ethnicity). Of the 117 induced genes, 14 were found in datasets from RSV and 40 from influenza; 95 genes were unique to COVID-19. Protein pathways were mostly generic responses to viral infections, including apoptosis by P53-associated pathway, but also included some unique pathways such as viral carcinogenesis. There were no major qualitative differences in pathways between ethnic groups. The composite gene-expression score was correlated with the time from onset of symptoms and nasal swab qPCR CT values (both p < 0.01) but was not related to participant age, gender, ethnicity or the presence or absence of chest X-ray abnormalities (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The whole-blood transcriptome of COVID-19 has overall similarity with other respiratory infections but there are some unique pathways that merit further exploration to determine clinical relevance. The approach to a disease score may be of value, but needs further validation in a population with a greater range of disease severity.
