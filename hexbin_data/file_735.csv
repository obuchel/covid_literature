28586,SentiInc: Incorporating Sentiment Information into Sentiment Transfer Without Parallel Data,2020-03-24,"BACKGROUND: Stark gaps exist between projected health needs in a pandemic situation and the current capacity of health care and medical countermeasure systems. Existing pandemic ethics discussions have advocated to engage the public in scarcity dilemmas and attend the local contexts and cultural perspectives that shape responses to a global health threat. This public engagement study thus considers the role of community and culture in the ethical apportionment of scarce health resources, specifically ventilators, during an influenza pandemic. It builds upon a previous exploration of the values and preferences of Maryland residents regarding how a finite supply of mechanical ventilators ought to be allocated during a severe global outbreak of influenza. An important finding of this earlier research was that local history and place within the state engendered different ways of thinking about scarcity. OBJECTIVE: Given the intrastate variation in the themes expressed by Maryland participants, the project team sought to examine interstate differences by implementing the same protocol elsewhere to answer the following questions. Does variation in ethical frames of reference exist within different regions of the United States? What practical implications does evidence of sameness and difference possess for pandemic planners and policymakers at local and national levels? METHODS: Research using the same deliberative democracy process from the Maryland study was conducted in Central Texas in March 2018 among 30 diverse participants, half of whom identified as Hispanic or Latino. Deliberative democracy provides a moderated process through which community members can learn facts about a public policy matter from experts and explore their own and others’ views. RESULTS: Participants proposed that by evenly distributing supplies of ventilators and applying clear eligibility criteria consistently, health authorities could enable fair allocation of scarce lifesaving equipment. The strong identification, attachment, and obligation of persons toward their nuclear and extended families emerged as a distinctive regional and ethnic core value that has practical implications for the substance, administration, and communication of allocation frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Maryland and Central Texas residents expressed a common, overriding concern about the fairness of allocation decisions. Central Texas deliberants, however, more readily expounded upon family as a central consideration. In Central Texas, family is a principal, culturally inflected lens through which life and death matters are often viewed. Conveners of other pandemic-related public engagement exercises in the United States have advocated the benefits of transparency and inclusivity in developing an ethical allocation framework; this study demonstrates cultural competence as a further advantage.","Schoch-Spana, Monica; Brunson, Emily K; Gwon, Howard; Regenberg, Alan; Toner, Eric S; Daugherty-Biddison, Elizabeth L",J Particip Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7141421/,735

28673,Early Detection of Rumours on Twitter via Stance Transfer Learning,2020-03-17,"Emerging evidence suggests that the tripartite motif containing 62 (TRIM62), a member of the TRIM family, plays an important role in antiviral processes. The objective of the study was to explore the role of TRIM62 in reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) infection and its potential molecular mechanism. We first demonstrated that the REV infection affected the TRIM62 expression first upregulated and then downregulated in CEF cells. Next, we evaluated the effect of TRIM62 on viral replication. Overexpression of TRIM62 decreased REV replication. On the contrary, silencing of endogenously expressed TRIM62 increased viral replication. Then, to explore the necessity of domains in TRIM62's negative regulation on viral replication, we transfected CEF cells with TRIM62 domain deletion mutants. Deletion domain partially abolished TRIM62's antiviral activity. The effect of SPRY domain deletion was the highest and that of coiled-coil was the lowest. Further, we identified 18 proteins that coimmunoprecipitated and interacted with TRIM62 by immunocoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis. Strikingly, among which, both Ras-related protein Rab-5b (RAB5B) and Arp2/3 complex 34-kDa subunit (ARPC2) were involved in actin cytoskeletal pathway. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that chicken TRIM62 provides host defense against viral infection, and all domains are required for its action. RAB5B and ARPC2 may play important roles in its negative regulation processes.","Li, Ling; Niu, Dongyan; Yang, Jie; Bi, Jianmin; Zhang, Lingjuan; Cheng, Ziqiang; Wang, Guihua",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146716/,735
28678,Recognizing Semantic Relations: Attention-Based Transformers vs. Recurrent Models,2020-03-17,"Infection control is an essential component of health care. The literature generally suggests that most health professionals’ knowledge of infection control principles and standards is poor or, at the very least, inadequate. There is a paucity of research examining paramedic knowledge of infection control principles and standards, particularly in the Australian pre-hospital context. The purpose of this study was to determine paramedic knowledge of standard infection control definitions and principles in an Australian emergency medical system (EMS). A confidential and anonymous mail survey was distributed to all paramedics working in a State-wide Australian ambulance service (n=2274) A total of 1258 surveys were returned - a response rate of 55.3%. Only 46.2% (n=581) of the participants identified the correct components of the ’chain of infection’. Correct identification of the definition of ’nosocomial’ was made by 27,9% (n=347) of participants. Less than one-fifth (17.2%, n=217) of participants identified 'standards and additional precautions’ as the current system of infection control. Less than half (41.6%, n=523) of the sample correctly identified hand washing as the primary’ infection control strategy’ to prevent cross-infection. This study suggests knowledge of fundamental principles and standards of infection control among paramedics is poor in this jurisdiction and recommends the introduction of comprehensive in-service education programmes in infection control. Further research is required to investigate if, and how, these results may be realised in practice.","Shaban, Ramon Z.",Aust Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146778/,735

28727,Axiomatic Analysis of Contact Recommendation Methods in Social Networks: An IR Perspective,2020-03-17,"The war in Iraq, the threat of terrorism and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic have made international business activities increasingly difficult and risky. The worldwide economic downturn and slow growth in domestic markets are forcing companies to depend more than ever on overseas trade. SARS emerged in China in November 2002 and has spread to 26 countries. The SARS epidemic has caused the most severe economic crisis in Southeast Asia since the wave of bank failures and currency devaluations that swept the region five years ago. The SARS epidemic has prompted health officials to implement travel advisories and restrictions, in order to defer nonessential travel to regions of Asia with large numbers of SARS cases. They are enforcing quarantine and isolation measures in major cities to try and limit the spread of SARS. The President of the United States has signed an executive order adding SARS to the list of communicable diseases that can be quarantined. A major disruption in China could paralyze just‐in‐time supply chains and cause an economic crisis for retailers and other businesses worldwide. The SARS epidemic has caused many economists to drastically reduce their economic‐growth forecasts for Asia. New infectious diseases, such as SARS, can emerge and easily travel around the globe, infecting less‐resilient hosts and mutating because of the influence of viruses and bacteria in their new environment. Health officials are even more concerned about the pandemic disaster that hasn’t happened, but may still. However, the SARS epidemic has created positive economic benefits for some companies.","Overby, John; Rayburn, Mike; Hammond, Kevin; Wyld, David C.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147331/,735

Boms BCG cell wall glicopeptid — EIA for antituberculosis antibodies detection,2004-04-02,"The nuclear receptor heterodimers of liver X receptors (LXRs) are recently identified as key transcriptional regulators of genes involved in lipid homeostasis and inflammation. LXRs and their ligands are negative regulators of macrophage inflammatory gene expression. Multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system of unknown cause, is characterized by recurrent inflammation involving macrophages and their inflammatory mediators. Sweden belongs to the countries with a high MS incidence. In Italy, incidence is lower, with an exception for Sardinia where the incidence is even higher than that in Sweden. Subjects from Sardinia are ethnically more homogeneous and differ from Swedes, also regarding genetic background and environment. We studied LXRs and their related molecules of blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) from female patients with untreated relapsing‐remitting MS from Sassari, Sardinia and Stockholm, Sweden. Sex‐ and age‐matched healthy controls (HCs) were from both areas. mRNA expression was evaluated by real‐time PCR. LXR‐α was lower (P < 0.05) in MS (mean ± SEM: 3.1 ± 0.2; n = 37) compared to HC (3.6 ± 0.1; n = 37). LXR‐α was lower in MS from Stockholm (2.6 ± 0.2; n = 22) compared to corresponding HC (3.4 ± 0.1; n = 22; P < 0.01) and compared to MS (3.8 ± 0.2; n = 15; P < 0.001) and HC (4 ± 0.2; n = 15; P < 0.001) from Sardinia. MS patients from Stockholm, but not from Sassari, also expressed lower (P < 0.05) LXR‐β (−4.1 ± 0.4) compared to corresponding HC (−2.9 ± 0.3). MS from Stockholm was associated with higher ABCA‐1 (6.1 ± 0.4 versus 5.0 ± 0.3; P < 0.05) and higher estrogen receptor‐β‐Cx (2.4 ± 0.4 versus 0.8 ± 0.4; P < 0.01) compared to corresponding HC. The HC from Sassari had higher androgen receptor (2.9 ± 0.2) compared to MS from Sassari (1.4 ± 0.3; P < 0.01), MS (1.3 ± 0.4; P < 0.01) and HC from Stockholm (1.2 ± 0.3; P < 0.01). MS from Sassari had lower cyclooxygenase‐1 compared to corresponding HC (5.1 ± 0.4 versus 6.6 ± 0.3; P < 0.01) and lower prostaglandin‐E (−0.03 ± 0.5) compared to the HC (1.4 ± 0.5; P < 0.05) and MS (2.7 ± 0.4; P < 0.05) and HC from Stockholm (1.9 ± 0.4, P < 0.001). Our findings identify LXRs and their related molecules as being involved in MS from Stockholm but not from Sassari, while sex hormone receptors seem to be involved in MS in Sassari.","Huang, Y.‐M.; Liu, X.; Steffensen, K.; Sanna, A.; Arru, G.; Sominanda, A.; Sotgiu, S.; Rosati, G.; Gustafsson, J.‐Å.; Link, H.",Scand J Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169544/,735

A spike within this wave occurred in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September 2001. The nature of the nationalism introduced in the second wave was somewhat different to that of the previously discussed agrarian populism or the anti-tax neo-liberal populism in the early 1970s. Rather than primarily referring to the social-economic situation of the ordinary people the emphasis moved over to a socio-cultural notion of our people. Although xenophobia and ethno-nationalism was surely a significant part of the populist message from the outset that sort of rhetoric rose much more clearly to the forefront in the second wave.","Bergmann, Eirikur",Neo-Nationalism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245512/,735
33007,Hypotheses Elicitation in Early-Stage Software Startups Based on Cognitive Mapping,2020-05-06,"Low-pathogenicity avian influenza H9N2 remains an endemic disease worldwide despite continuous vaccination, indicating the need for an improved vaccine strategy. Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), a gram-positive and endospore-forming bacterium, is a non-pathogenic species that has been used in probiotic formulations for both animals and humans. The objective of the present study was to elucidate the effect of B. subtilis spores as adjuvants in chickens administered inactivated avian influenza virus H9N2. Herein, the adjuvanticity of B. subtilis spores in chickens was demonstrated by enhancement of H9N2 virus-specific IgG responses. B. subtilis spores enhanced the proportion of B cells and the innate cell population in splenocytes from chickens administered both inactivated H9N2 and B. subtilis spores (Spore + H9N2). Furthermore, the H9N2 and spore administration induced significantly increased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 compared to that in the H9N2 only group. Additionally, total splenocytes from chickens immunized with inactivated H9N2 in the presence or absence of B. subtilis spores were re-stimulated with inactivated H9N2. The subsequent results showed that the extent of antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell proliferation was higher in the Spore + H9N2 group than in the group administered only H9N2. Taken together, these data demonstrate that B. subtilis spores, as adjuvants, enhance not only H9N2 virus-specific IgG but also CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses, with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This approach to vaccination with inactivated H9N2 together with a B. subtilis spore adjuvant in chickens produces a significant effect on antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses against avian influenza virus.","Lee, Ji Eun; Kye, Yoon-Chul; Park, Sung-Moo; Shim, Byoung-Shik; Yoo, Sungsik; Hwang, Eunmi; Kim, Hyungkuen; Kim, Sung-Jo; Han, Seung Hyun; Park, Tae Sub; Park, Byung-Chul; Yun, Cheol-Heui",Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245620/,735
33008,Combining User-Centered Design and Lean Startup with Agile Software Development: A Case Study of Two Agile Teams,2020-05-06,"BACKGROUND: In ARDS patients, mechanical ventilation should minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. The mechanical power which is the energy per unit time released to the respiratory system according to the applied tidal volume, PEEP, respiratory rate, and flow should reflect the ventilator-induced lung injury. However, similar levels of mechanical power applied in different lung sizes could be associated to different effects. The aim of this study was to assess the role both of the mechanical power and of the transpulmonary mechanical power, normalized to predicted body weight, respiratory system compliance, lung volume, and amount of aerated tissue on intensive care mortality. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of ARDS patients previously enrolled in seven published studies. All patients were sedated, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated. After 20 min from a recruitment maneuver, partitioned respiratory mechanics measurements and blood gas analyses were performed with a PEEP of 5 cmH(2)O while the remaining setting was maintained unchanged from the baseline. A whole lung CT scan at 5 cmH(2)O of PEEP was performed to estimate the lung gas volume and the amount of well-inflated tissue. Univariate and multivariable Poisson regression models with robust standard error were used to calculate risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals of ICU mortality. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two ARDS patients were included; 88 (40%) died in ICU. Mechanical power was not different between survivors and non-survivors 14.97 [11.51–18.44] vs. 15.46 [12.33–21.45] J/min and did not affect intensive care mortality. The multivariable robust regression models showed that the mechanical power normalized to well-inflated tissue (RR 2.69 [95% CI 1.10–6.56], p = 0.029) and the mechanical power normalized to respiratory system compliance (RR 1.79 [95% CI 1.16–2.76], p = 0.008) were independently associated with intensive care mortality after adjusting for age, SAPS II, and ARDS severity. Also, transpulmonary mechanical power normalized to respiratory system compliance and to well-inflated tissue significantly increased intensive care mortality (RR 1.74 [1.11–2.70], p = 0.015; RR 3.01 [1.15–7.91], p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: In our ARDS population, there is not a causal relationship between the mechanical power itself and mortality, while mechanical power normalized to the compliance or to the amount of well-aerated tissue is independently associated to the intensive care mortality. Further studies are needed to confirm this data.","Coppola, Silvia; Caccioppola, Alessio; Froio, Sara; Formenti, Paolo; De Giorgis, Valentina; Galanti, Valentina; Consonni, Dario; Chiumello, Davide",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245621/,735

These factors reasonably comprise, for example, risk perception and attitude towards risk, embeddedness in a social network or the desire for social approval and may differ remarkably among the individuals of a collective. The paper adopts a management control perspective which appears to be particularly helpful to identify how to implement policy makers’ actions with respect to the diverse individuals in a collective. In order to predict the overall outcome of “unpleasant” actions, an approach is required which allows to capture the heterogeneity of individuals within a collective which makes agent-based modelling a promising candidate.","Wall, Friederike",Mind Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7407422/,735
37757,Analysis and Refactoring of Software Systems Using Performance Antipattern Profiles,2020-03-13,"BACKGROUND: High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy is being increasingly used to prevent post-extubation hypoxemic respiratory failure and reintubation. However, evidence to support the use of HFNC in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure after extubation is limited. This study was conducted to test if HFNC is non-inferior to non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in preventing post-extubation treatment failure in COPD patients previously intubated for hypercapnic respiratory failure. METHODS: COPD patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure who were already receiving invasive ventilation were randomized to HFNC or NIV at extubation at two large tertiary academic teaching hospitals. The primary endpoint was treatment failure, defined as either resumption of invasive ventilation or switching to the other study treatment modality (NIV for patients in the NFNC group or vice versa). RESULTS: Ninety-six patients were randomly assigned to the HFNC group or NIV group. After secondary exclusion, 44 patients in the HFNC group and 42 patients in the NIV group were included in the analysis. The treatment failure rate in the HFNC group was 22.7% and 28.6% in the NIV group—risk difference of − 5.8% (95% CI, − 23.8–12.4%, p = 0.535), which was significantly lower than the non-inferior margin of 9%. Analysis of the causes of treatment failure showed that treatment intolerance in the HFNC group was significantly lower than that in the NIV group, with a risk difference of − 50.0% (95% CI, − 74.6 to − 12.9%, p = 0.015). One hour after extubation, the mean respiratory rates of both groups were faster than their baseline levels before extubation (p < 0.050). Twenty-four hours after extubation, the respiratory rate of the HFNC group had returned to baseline, but the NIV group was still higher than the baseline. Forty-eight hours after extubation, the respiratory rates of both groups were not significantly different from the baseline. The average number of daily airway care interventions in the NIV group was 7 (5–9.3), which was significantly higher than 6 (4–7) times in the HFNC group (p = 0.006). The comfort score and incidence of nasal and facial skin breakdown of the HFNC group was also significantly better than that of the NIV group [7 (6–8) vs 5 (4–7), P < 0.001] and [0 vs 9.6%, p = 0.027], respectively. CONCLUSION: Among COPD patients with severe hypercapnic respiratory failure who received invasive ventilation, the use of HFNC after extubation did not result in increased rates of treatment failure compared with NIV. HFNC also had better tolerance and comfort than NIV. TRIAL REGISTRATION: chictr.org (ChiCTR1800018530).

To date, the factors affecting complete recovery of adult survivors from ECMO have not been investigated. METHODS: Data from adult patients in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry who received veno-venous ECMO between 2012 and 2017 were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In total, 6536 patients with 242,183 days of veno-venous ECMO were reviewed. The overall survival to discharge rate after weaning from ECMO was 89.7% (n = 5861), and 10.3% (n = 675) of the patients died during hospitalization. The discharge location varied as follows: 33.7% (n = 1976) returned home, 23.4% (n = 1369) were transferred to a referral hospital, 41.8% (n = 2447) required hospital services, and 0.6% (n = 36) were discharged to other places. The patients were divided into two groups according to the discharge location: a complete recovery group (n = 1976) and a partial recovery group (n = 3885). In the multivariate analyses, age (≥ 65 years) (odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59–0.87, p = 0.001), cardiac arrest before ECMO (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60–0.96, p = 0.021), vasopressor use (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64–0.83, p < 0.001), renal replacement therapy (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.28–0.57, p < 0.001), ECMO-related complications (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.85, p < 0.001), and long-term ECMO support (≥ 2 weeks) (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.37–0.48, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with complete recovery. CONCLUSION: Complete recovery after veno-venous ECMO support is associated with the patient’s baseline condition, ECMO duration, and ECMO-related complications. Respiratory ECMO should aim to increase both the survival and the quality of life after weaning from ECMO.","Yeo, Hye Ju; Kim, Yun Seong; Kim, Dohyung; Cho, Woo Hyun",J Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7439234/,735

This has been experienced, for example, in COVID-19 cases where propagation of infections may not be controlled effectively. Given that data is exchanged between parties it becomes important to have a focus on how this data can be used as a contact trace mechanism. This contract trace mechanism can also provide Potential Digital Evidence (PDE) that can aid to form an objective hypothesis that could be employed during litigation in the event of a suspicious infection, or when a security incident is detected.

48736,A Decision Tree Lifted Domain for Analyzing Program Families with Numerical Features,2021-02-24,"Road maintenance is generally analyzed considering complex types of work which must respect two considerable aspects: the first relating to the safety of workers, road users and those who somehow come into contact with the area on the other; the second instead correlated to the reduction of the impacts due to the shrinkage of the superstructure which entails criticalities to the transit vehicle flow. The evaluated parameters are the type of road, the position but also with the duration, visibility, speed and type of traffic. This work focuses on the evaluation of two different construction site layouts related to the TTMS (Temporary Traffic Management Scheme) which are periodically implemented in a medium-high traffic section of a small mountain town. The monitored area is located in one of the main connecting arteries of the city, adjacent to the main areas of attraction linked to the nearby commercial, residential and university areas. The study was addressed through the use of a micro-simulation tool. The results demonstrate how a different extension of the section to be maintained can drastically reduce the level of service (LOS), keeping equal vehicle flow. This approach is useful for road managers and local Authorities in order to analyze the impacts produced by the construction site in terms of increased congestion of the vehicle flow, evaluating this as the dimensions of the construction site vary. This preventive assessment aims to consider the best solution to be implemented in order not to interfere with other activities as this could further reduce the accessibility of the adjoining places.","Campisi, Tiziana; Tesoriere, Giovanni; Sanfilippo, Luigi; Brignone, Alberto; Canale, Antonino",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978621/,735

Valuing the Earth: economics, ecology, ethics. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1993, pp. 267–285): an economy based on capital’s expanded reproduction in a limited environment occupies a position in economic theory that is the equivalent of the fundamental impossibilities of physics. This chapter examines the two impossibilities of implementing regulatory frameworks capable of containing the tendency toward collapse within the realm of globalized capitalism: (1) the self-regulation of economic agents induced by the presence of mechanisms emanating from the market itself and (2) regulation induced not only by market mechanisms but also by agreements negotiated between businesses, the state, and civil society. The idea of self-regulation does not apply to capitalism because markets are not ruled by the principle of homeostasis. Moreover, capitalism cannot price its action on ecosystems because ecosystems are broader in space and time than the investment/profit cycle. No matter how corporate leaders want to improve their corporations’ ethical conduct, they cannot afford to subordinate their corporate goals to the environmental imperative. Analysis of the second impossibility mentioned above (regulation induced by agreements negotiated between businesses, the state, and civil society) touches on the punctus dolens of all the problems discussed in this chapter and even in this book: the impossibility of this second route stems from the lack of parity between the parties, a necessary condition for an effective negotiation.","Marques, Luiz",Capitalism and Environmental Collapse,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978718/,735

In this chapter, we investigate changes in political legitimacy during the coronavirus crisis in the Netherlands. Amidst of the pandemic, we collected unique, representative data among LISS-panel respondents that supplemented the European Values Study 2017. We demonstrate that the Dutch public (temporarily) lowered their democratic aspirations thereby longing for strong leadership while simultaneously increasing their trust in the incumbent Government, which, combined, resulted in more political legitimacy.

In March 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 spread to Venezuela and Ecuador. The basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text] ) is a value that allows measuring the transmission rate of a virus. The SIR model is the simplest compartmental epidemiological model (Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered). The SIR model can be used to estimate [Formula: see text] by fitting the curve of the infected compartment to the experimental curve of infected subjects per day. This work aims to study the projection of the [Formula: see text] of SARS-CoV-2 in Venezuela and Ecuador. For this purpose, five experiments took place by adjusting the SIR model curve of the infected compartment to experimental data at five-time intervals (the first 14, 28, 42, 56, and 178 days for Ecuador data and 165 days for Venezuela data). The [Formula: see text] fell from 6.923 to 1.003 (between experiments 2 and 3) for Venezuelan data, and from 3.622 to 1.022 (between experiments 1 and 2) for Ecuadorian data. These differences imply that [Formula: see text] depends on the preventive measures implemented to face the pandemic. On the other hand, the number of infections in Ecuador is higher compared to the infection numbers in Venezuela in each experiment. Venezuela is experiencing a complex economic crisis that limits the ability of its citizens to mobilize due to the lack of gasoline, monetary liquidity, and failures in basics services, suggesting that the economic activity of the countries will also influence the number of infections.","La Cruz, Alexandra; Severeyn, Erika; Velásquez, Jesús; Herrera, Héctor; Wong, Sara","Artificial Intelligence, Computer and Software Engineering Advances",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978877/,735

These smart mobility services thus need to be very well protected against a variety of security threats, such as intrusion, jamming, and Sybil attacks. One of the frequently cited attacks in smart mobility is the jamming attack. In order to detect the jamming attacks, different anti-jamming applications have been developed to reduce the impact of malicious jamming attacks. One important step in anti-jamming detection is to cluster the vehicular data. However, it is usually very time-consuming to detect the jamming attacks that may affect the safety of roads and vehicle communication in real-time. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient big data clustering model, coresets-based clustering, to support the real-time detection of jamming attacks.

RVs of groups A, B, C, E, H, I and J have been detected in sporadic, endemic or epidemic infections of various mammalian species, whereas RV strains of groups D, F and G are only found in poultry, such as chickens and turkeys. Recently identified novel RVs in sheltered dogs in Hungary and bats in Serbia are tentatively identified as group I and J, respectively. Historically, diagnosis of RV infections relied on conventional techniques such as isolation in cell culture, electron microscopy, electropherotyping and various serological tests. Presently, RT-PCR assays and molecular typing using sequencing or genomic hybridization techniques are used predominantly for RV diagnosis and classification. Because RVs are endemic in most animal populations and exhibit extreme genetic diversity due to frequent mutations and re-assortment events, available RV vaccines are only marginally efficient, and eradication of the pathogen remains a challenge. Thus, a better understanding of the historic and current prevalence and genetic diversity of animal RVs in different geographic regions, disease pathogenesis, available control strategies and zoonotic potential is needed. This knowledge will lead to the development of more optimal strategies to manage RV diarrhoeal disease in animals, birds and humans.","Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Deol, Pallavi; Sircar, Shubhankar; Ghosh, Souvik; Jakab, Szilvia; Bányai, Krisztián; Dhama, K.; Amimo, Joshua O.; Saif, Linda J.; Malik, Yashpal Singh",Animal-Origin Viral Zoonoses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978947/,735

Technological advancements heavily impact the way people work while most recent socio-political and demographic changes (e.g. ‘Brexit’, economic instability, higher education reforms, generation attitude changes and a pandemic crisis) increase the need for critical insights on how digital competences of the workforce can improve and sustain business competitiveness. While some organisations remain reluctant to foster their workforce’s digital qualifications, many view digitalisation as an opportunity to enhance employees’ skillsets with company-specific competences for competitive advantage, further being supported by educational institutions which offer tailored human resource development (HRD) programmes (Gartner Co, Gartner identifies three megatrends that will drive digital business into the next decade, 2017).

Researchers find gender inclusion benefits workers and companies through enhanced worker and customer satisfaction, increased profits, and worker well-being. Why does gender workplace equity remain a “stalled revolution”? We suggest work/family dynamics supporting challenges of care for the most vulnerable—children, elders, the disabled, adults experiencing ill health—need to be “re-visioned” as “wicked problems” within applied complexity/developmental systems sciences. Complexity sciences argue gendered inequalities maintain stability through entangled forces at multiple levels yet can be transformed through problem-and-setting specific ecological analysis, identifying leverage points for maximum impact toward achieving valued outcomes. We apply transdisciplinary cultural/developmental systems perspectives on the gendered, interdependent life course, highlighting shared individual, family/kin, business, and public responsibilities toward supporting work and caretaking (Brandth, Halrynjo, & Kvande, 2017). These approaches help map multi-systemic factors offering impactful leverage points catalyzing measurable change. Global comparative literatures identify three transformative leverage points: (1) Gender-neutral paid family/kinship care leave when meeting life course challenges of childbearing/adoption and infant care; (2) Public/private partnerships providing flexible, predictable employment and institutional supports for early childhood care, schooling, and dependent caretaking needs for workers at all income levels (Thébaud & Halcomb, 2018); (3) Systems-minded organizational interventions addressing gender stereotyping of work/family decisions in Human Resources administration and in leadership training for both managers and workers.","Shapiro, Ester R.; Kato, Emu",Exploring Gender at Work,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991171/,735

With an expanding middle class and the global population projection of the country set to reach 300 m by 2030 and 400 m by 2050, Nigeria is seen to potentially provide growth for Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (Oxford Business Group Report 2020b). Nigeria is therefore a significant emerging and investment partner for global competitiveness and in the best place to reap the opportunities of global new industrial technologies for governance, development, and security. It is important to stress from the standpoint of certain political, economic, and sociodemographic base factors that Nigeria is arguably seen as the giant of Africa. However, Nigeria has continued to struggle with Boko Haram terrorism and insurgency in the North east, economic sabotage on its strategic oil facilities and infrastructure in the Niger Delta‚ and the menace of cattle rustling and armed banditry in the north-central and west geopolitical zones. The missing link associated with these poor development and insecurity indices is lack of good governance as abundance of resources cannot guarantee security and development when there is absence of active commitment to political governance (Akahalu 2014). It is against this backdrop that this chapter examines the prevailing challenges to governance, security, and development in Nigeria. The chapter captures an exploration of the governance, security‚ and development nexus in Nigeria‚ and provides a sectoral analysis of Nigeria based on the performance of key sectors, as well as the key challenges of security and development besetting the country. The chapter thus concludes that for Nigeria to reclaim its continental hegemony, it needs to address those multi-faced challenges counting the cost on the country’s peace, security‚ and international outlook.","Bala, Bashir; Tar, Usman A.","The Governance, Security and Development Nexus",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991189/,735

Despite the increase of CGM users in developed countries, SMBG is the only option of glucose monitoring for the majority of people with diabetes. Frequent SMBG is key to achieve glycaemic targets correlating with HbA1c < 7%, and associated with reduced risk of diabetes complication. Although there are numerous advantages of using HbA1c, it also has limitations and is estimated that 14–25% of the HbA1c results in clinical practice are misleading. Novel glucometrics have been introduced with the wider use of CGMs, and were associated with reduction of microvascular complications in people with diabetes. These glucometrics could also be used with BGMs, of great importance for developing countries where CGMs would not be widely available soon. Centralized procurement could result in reduction of prices per test strip. Considerable increase in the number of free test strips in settings with limited resources has resulted in reduction of acute diabetes emergencies. There is an underutilization of SMBG both in developed and developing countries. Frequent use of SMBG and novel glucometrics in developing countries could be cost-effective in reduction of diabetes complications.","Smokovski, Ivica",Managing Diabetes in Low Income Countries,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991192/,735

While the health consequences of these events have been recognized, the emotional sequelae suffered by people immediately and over a long term are also a priority. Similarly, disaster risk reduction and structural resilience has been emphasized in terms of alarm systems and building codes relative to coastlines, yet more attention to the psychosocial resilience of people is warranted. While mounting literature suggests the need for psychosocial interventions to assist survivors and the extended global community to address these important psychosocial impacts, more action, support and research are called for, to establish an evidence base for such programs. To support these efforts, and for them to be effective, policies are necessary on the national and intergovernmental level. The purpose of this chapter is threefold. First, I describe extensive advocacy on the part of psychologists regarding psychosocial resilience and recovery. Second, I review significant and ground-breaking government agreements and policies that currently support such efforts. Third, I highlight the importance of these agreements as a foundation for interventions.

Limitations on social gathering have called the wisdom of a conventional trauma meeting into question. We have initiated our virtual trauma meeting and report our early results. MATERIALS AND METHODS Daily morning trauma meetings are now conducted online. Following instigation, we collated the results of a feedback form completed online to assess the relative merits of a virtual trauma meeting. RESULTS There were 27 responses received to the electronically administered virtual trauma meeting evaluation survey, from a range of trauma and orthopaedic department personnel. There were no concerns regarding patient safety or decision making and, apart from the quality of the audio (63% dissatisfied or very dissatisfied) positive feedback outweighed negative feedback in every category. At 74%, the majority of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied overall with the virtual trauma meeting. CONCLUSION Trauma meetings can be safely conducted in a virtual environment with high standards of patient care maintained.

Following PRISMA guidelines, we used predefined eligibility criteria to search the databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and EBSCO Host for peer-reviewed published literature that investigated the nexus between COVID-19 and air quality in China. After screening the titles, abstracts and full texts of the retrieved results, two reviewers independently evaluated the relevant data. 35 of 508 studies met our criteria. The majority of the eligible studies reported data from central China (e.g., Wuhan and Hubei Province), and the most frequently measured air pollutant was nitrogen dioxide (NO2;51 values in 28 studies), followed by fine particulate matter (PM2.5;49 values in 26 studies). We found evidence of a substantial reduction in air pollution immediately after lockdown measures were implemented, with traffic-related NO2 exhibiting the largest decrease. The reported reductions in air pollution varied by region and period. Specifically, urban, industrial and highly populated areas of China experienced greater improvements in air quality than rural, residential and less populated areas. Additionally, owing to meteorological factors, the effects differed between inland and coastal regions. However, despite the changes, the pollutant concentrations in many regions (e.g., Beijing, where PM2.5 and PM10 levels remained above 100 mu g m(-3)) still exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO)'s 24-hour mean guidelines (e.g., 25 mu g m(-3) and 50 mu g m(-3) for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively).

164751,G-Cloud Briefcase - Electronic Archive for Academic Certificates and General Certificates of Education Documents Using Public Private Hyperspace for E-Government Library Services Based on NOSQL Databases,2021,"Purpose Authors of knowledge syntheses make many subjective decisions during their review process. Those decisions, which are guided in part by author characteristics, can impact the conduct and conclusions of knowledge syntheses, which assimilate much of the evidence base in medical education. Therefore, to better understand the evidence base, this study describes the characteristics of knowledge synthesis authors, focusing on gender, geography, and institution. Method In 2020, the authors conducted a case study of authors of 963 knowledge syntheses published between 1999 and 2019 in 14 core medical education journals using a publicly accessible dataset. Results The authors of the present study identified 4,110 manuscript authors across all authorship positions. On average there were 4.3 authors per knowledge synthesis (SD=2.51, Median=4, Range=1-22); 79 knowledge syntheses (8%) were single-author publications. Over time, the average number of authors per synthesis increased (M=1.80 in 1999; M=5.34 in 2019). Knowledge syntheses were authored by slightly more females (n=2047; 50.5%) than males (n=2005; 49.5%) across all author positions (Pearson X2=22.02, p<.001). Authors listed affiliations in 58 countries, and 58 knowledge syntheses (6%) included authors from low- or middle-income countries (LMIC). Authors from the United States (n=366; 38%), Canada (n=233; 24%), and the United Kingdom (n=180; 19%) published the most knowledge syntheses. Authors listed affiliation at 617 unique institutions, and first authors represented 362 unique institutions with greatest representation from the University of Toronto (n=55, 6%) and the Mayo Clinic (n=31, 3%). Across all authorship positions, the large majority of knowledge syntheses (n=753; 78%) included authors at top 200 ranked institutions. Conclusions Knowledge synthesis author teams have grown over the past 20 years, and while there is near gender parity across all author positions, authorship has been dominated by North American researchers located at highly ranked institutions. This suggests a potential overrepresentation of certain authors with particular characteristics, which may impact the conduct and conclusions of knowledge syntheses in medical education.","Maggio, L.

The following paper concerns the initial tests completed on the Facebook Ad Manager platform for the chatbot-delivered digital health intervention Elena+ Care for COVID-19. Eleven advertisements were run in the UK and Ireland during August/September 2020, with resulting downloads, post (i.e. advert) reactions, post shares and other advertisement engagement metrics tracked. Key findings from our advertising campaigns highlight that: (i) static images with text function better than carousel of images, (ii) Android users download and exhibit greater engagement behaviors than iOS users, and (iii) middle-aged and older women have the highest number of downloads and the most engaged behaviors (i.e. reacting to posts, sharing posts etc.). Lessons learned are discussed considering how other designers of digital health interventions may benefit and learn from our results when trialing and running their own ad campaigns. It is hoped that such discussions will be beneficial to other health practitioners seeking to scale-up their digital health interventions widely and reach individuals in need.","Ollier, J.; Santhanam, P.; Kowatsch, T.",Healthinf: Proceedings of the 14th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies - Vol. 5: Healthinf,https://doi.org/10.5220/0010403707810788,735

We decompose domestic and international technology spillovers and introduce them into an economic growth model to investigate the elasticities of factor inputs and knowledge spillovers through industrial linkages, and eventually estimate a model with spatial specifications. The results from the scenario simulations suggest that the global total output is projected to fall by 3.60% and 8.41% under the V-shaped and L-shaped recovery scenarios, respectively, and that the propagation through input-output linkages is an important channel that causes global economic fluctuations. Economies at the hub of the production network, that is, the United States, China, and Germany, are the most seriously affected. Structural decomposition analysis results indicate that the shortage of intermediate inputs supply is the main driver of output decline, followed by the blockage of technology diffusion, and lastly, the reduction of labour supply. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Liu, W.; Cheng, Q.",Applied Economics,https://doi.org/10.1080/00036846.2021.1958140,735

The sensitivity is generally equivalent, and it comes with much less discomfort for the patient. While there is an overall good performance in the literature for adults, there is much less information on the use of saliva in children or in the general practitioner's setting. Methods: We tested a novel commercially available saliva collection kit with a virus inactivating and RNA stabilizing buffer (InActiv Blue(R)) in matched saliva and swab samples from 245 individuals, including 216 children, collected by general practitioners. Results: Blind RT-qPCR testing of the saliva samples confirmed all 23 positives identified by swab testing (100% concordance), irrespective of age, presence of symptoms, or high-risk status. One child's saliva sample was found low positive while negative on the nasopharyngeal swab, resulting in an overall relative sensitivity of RT-qPCR saliva testing of 104.3%.

To date, however, there has been limited insight into the nature and the extent of aging-related alterations in internal face representations. Here, we sought to address these issues by using an image reconstruction approach that capitalizes on the structure of behavioral data to reveal the pictorial content of visual representations. To this end, healthy young and older adults provided similarity judgments with pairs of face images. Facial shape and surface features were subsequently derived from the structure of the data for each participant and combined into image reconstructions of facial appearance. Our findings revealed that image reconstruction was successful for every participant, irrespective of age. However, reconstruction accuracies of shape and surface information were lower for older individuals than young individuals. Specifically, facial features diagnostic for face perception, such as eye shape and skin tone, were reconstructed poorly in older adults relative to young adults. At the same time, we found that age-related effects only accounted for a relatively small proportion of individual variability in face representations. Thus, our results provide novel insight into age-related changes in visual perception, they account for the decline in facial recognition occurring with age and they demonstrate the utility of image reconstruction to uncovering internal representations across a variety of populations.","Chang, Chi-Hsun; Nemrodov, Dan; Drobotenko, Natalia; Nestor, Adrian; Lee, Andy C.

Four preregistered experiments (N = 532, N = 472, N = 605, N = 382) with online U.S. samples introduced false claims concerning a (fictional) virus created as a bioweapon, mirroring conspiracy theories about COVID-19, and carcinogenic effects of GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms). We identify two critical determinants of vulnerability to pseudoscience. First, participants who trust science are more likely to believe and disseminate false claims that contain scientific references than false claims that do not. Second, reminding participants of the value of critical evaluation reduces belief in false claims, whereas reminders of the value of trusting science do not. We conclude that trust in science, although desirable in many ways, makes people vulnerable to pseudoscience. These findings have implications for science broadly and the application of psychological science to curbing misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic.","O039,; Brien, Thomas C.; Palmer, Ryan Albarracin Dolores",Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2021.104184,735
167444,COVID-19 Diagnosis from Chest X-Ray Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Effects of Data Poisoning,2021,"Anthropogenic emissions are significant drivers of temperature rises in major urban areas across the globe. Waste heat and exhaust emissions from motor vehicles and industrial combustion cause the warming of cities, resulting in microclimates' changes. Recently, national lockdown regulations restricting movement and socio-economic activities to curb the spread of a novel COVID-19 and the associated deaths have been implemented in various countries worldwide. Consequently, these unprecedented restrictions resulted in reductions in traffic volumes and industrial activities in most urban areas across the world. Thus, it was hypothesised that these reductions in traffic congestion and industrial activities in cities would reduce both air pollutants and thermal radiation. Using multisource data from Sentinel-5P, MERRA-2, and MODIS, this study assessed the short-term trends in emissions and land surface temperature in South Africa's economic hub, i.e., Gauteng Province. Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) trend analysis were used to characterise trends in CO, SO2, SO4, long-wave radiation (LWR), and land surface temperature (LST) at periods corresponding to various lockdown restrictions. The results showed a significant decline in atmospheric pollutants at Level-5 lockdown restrictions, followed by an abrupt increase as the regulations were eased to Level-4 lockdown. Similarly, LST and surface urban heat island (SUHI) reduced when compared to the previous year. Therefore, the lockdown restrictions provided an experimental scenario in which pollutants could be drastically reduced, thus accentuated the human impact on microclimates. © The Author(s).","Shikwambana, L.; Kganyago, M.; Mhangara, P.",Aerosol and Air Quality Research,https://doi.org/10.4209/aaqr.200437,735

The very existence of many businesses, and thus jobs, was at stake. However, one year after the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic, contrary to the pessimistic forecasts of business analysts, some industries did not experience the predicted negative effects of the crisis. This article presents the results of a pilot study on micro and small enterprises in the rubber products industry in Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the aim of analyzing the phenomenon of sustainable resource management that led not only to the survival of these enterprises but also to a significant increase in their turnover. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to analyze the key success factors of the indicated economic entities, with particular emphasis on the perspective of sustainable resource management and relationship management. On the basis of best research practices, a triangulation of research methods was applied (integrative literature review, computer-assisted telephone interviewing, and individual in-depth interview). A relationship was observed between the sustainable management of resources and the structure of the relationship network and the strength of its connections. In micro and small enterprises in the rubber products sector in Poland, sustainable resource management is related to the structure of the network of relations and the strength of connections in the network (relations/networking), as enterprises form a group of entities with a high level of loyalty, especially between the suppliers and buyers of raw materials. The formulated conclusions will become the basis for further in-depth research that can be conducted (a) in the same group of respondents, but using a representative research group, (b) in the same industry among a group of large enterprises, and (c) in a group of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from other industries.","Czainska, Katarzyna Sus Aleksandra Thalassinos Eleftherios I.",Resources,https://doi.org/10.3390/resources10080085,735

World Health Organization (WHO) named it as “COVID-19” on February 11, 2020. Currently, the COVID-19 has frightened the whole world of human beings and pushed into the pandemic. This coronavirus affects the respiratory system by entering into the human body through the droplets of saliva and mucus. It takes 14 days to observe the symptoms of the virus attack. In the meantime, the virus affected person may spread the virus to the coexisting people in the abode unknowingly. Also, it takes 48 h to confirm if a person is virus attacked after the test sample is collected. So, there is a serious need to wear a face mask that covers the nose and mouth besides maintaining the social distance to break the chain of massive increase. This paper attempts to detect if an individual wears a mask, using OpenCV. The accurate identification of landmarks of face in the image is an imperative challenge. Being instinctive it is simple for a human to detect the object, but it took years of research to raise the accessibility of quality datasets and a remarkable progress.

We explicitly assume a two-gender reproductory scheme, and we pay particular attention to the links between nodes. We show that even for a simple case with a relatively small number of nodes in the tree, there are a large number of possible ways to rearrange the links between generations. We present an open-source python code to generate the tree graph, the adjacency matrix, and the histogram of the links for each different tree representation. We show how this mapping reflects the difference between tree realizations, and how valuable information may be extracted upon inspection of these matrices. The algorithm includes a feature to average several tree realizations, obtain the connectivity distribution, and calculate the average and mean value. We used this feature to compare trees with a different number of generations and nodes. The code presented here, available in Git-Hub, may be easily modified to be applied to other areas of interest involving connections between individuals, extend the study to add more characteristics of the different nodes, etc.","Jarne, C.; Albarrac'in, F A.

Methods: The alcoholic extract of the aerial part of A. paniculata was used. In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, and mild symptoms were randomized 1:1 to receive APE (60 mg andrographolide, t.i.d, for 5 days) versus placebo, plus standard supportive care. Blood tests for CRP, liver and renal assessment were performed on Days 1, 3, and 5. The outcomes were occurrence of pneumonia detected by chest X-ray, nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 detection by rRT-PCR, changes of CRP levels, and adverse drug reactions. Results: Patients were randomized to receive APE (n=29) or placebo (n=28). Pneumonia occurrence during illness was 0/29 (0%) versus 3/28 (10.7%), (p=0.039); and patients with nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 detection on Day 5 were 10/29 (34.5%) versus 16/28 (57.1%), (p=0.086), for those who received APE and placebo, respectively. All three patients with pneumonia had substantially rising serum CRP; and high CRP levels on Day 5. None had evidence of liver or renal impairment. Conclusion: This AP-extract treatment regimen was potentially effective and safe in adults with mild COVID-19. The rising of CRP suggested disease progression.

172130,Development of fog computing based patient behavior monitoring system,2021,"Background: Males and females have altered immune responses resulting in variation in autoimmune and cardiovascular disease risk (CVR). Recently, these differences have played a role in the inflammatory response to COVID-19. Sex differences exist in the frequency and activity of immune-cell subsets but mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism remain unknown. Juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) is an autoimmune disorder that commonly emerges during puberty, has a strong female prevalence (female:male ratio, 4.5:1) and results in an increased CVR. JSLE is characterised by chronic inflammation and dyslipidaemia, where cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality for patients. Our previous work identified a link between immune cell function and lipid metabolism in adult-onset SLE. We hypothesised that sex hormones could influence both lipid metabolism and immune cell function and this could determine sex-specific susceptibility to JSLE and associated CVR. Objectives: We investigated the role of sex hormones in modifying systemic lipid metabolism and inflammation. Methods: Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy based serum metabolomics measuring over 130 lipoproteins (14-subsets with lipid compositions), flow cytometry measuring immune-cells, and RNA-sequencing were used to assess the metabolic and immune profile in young, pre/post-pubertal males (n=10/17) and females (n=10/23) and in individuals with gender-dysphoria (GD) under cross-hormone treatment (trans-male/female, n=26/25). This analysis was also performed on a cohort of post-pubertal male (n=12) and female (n=23) JSLE patients. Data was analysed by logistic regression, balanced random forest machine learning (BRF-ML), differential gene expression (DEG) and pathway analysis. Results: Post-pubertal males had significantly reduced cardio-protective high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subsets (p<0.0001) and increased cardio-pathogenic very-low-density lipoprotein subsets (p<0.0001) compared to females. These differences were not observed pre-puberty and were reversed significantly by cross-hormone treatment in GD individuals, suggesting that sex hormones regulate lipid metabolism in-vivo. BRF-ML (28 immune-cell subsets) identified an increased frequency of anti-inflammatory regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in post-pubertal males compared to females (p=0.0097). These Tregs were also more suppressive in males compared to females. Differences in Treg frequency were seen pre-puberty and were not altered by sex hormone treatment in GD individuals. However, Treg DEGs and functional transcriptomic pathways altered between post-pubertal males and females, including those involved in inflammatory signalling, overlapped with those altered by hormones in GD, suggesting hormones may also drive Treg functional changes. In addition, HDL metabolites modified by hormones showed differential associations with Treg phenotypes between post-pubertal males and females. Strikingly, sex differences in lipoproteins and Tregs were lost in JSLE, suggesting hormone signalling could be dysregulated in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity and could increase CVR for patients. Conclusion: Sex hormones drive altered lipoprotein metabolism and functional transcriptomic pathways in Tregs. Males have a lipoprotein profile associated with increased CVR, but a more anti-inflammatory immune profile compared to females. Together, this could explain sex differences in inflammatory disease susceptibilities and inform future sex-specific therapeutic strategies for the management of both JSLE and CVR.","Robinson, G.; Waddington, K.; Peng, J.; Radziszewska, A.; Peckham, H.; Isenberg, D.; Ioannou, Y.; Pineda Torra, I.; Ciurtin, C.; Jury, E.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.1405,735

The Machine Learning (ML) comes to the rescue of medicine by offering predictive analysis methods to predict the reappearance of outbreaks and thus help the healthcare system and decision-makers to take the necessary measures in advance. But which ML method should be used to predict an outbreak? Given the large number of ML methods, it is sometimes difficult to know which method to use. This is why we conducted this study. We looked at the above-mentioned outbreaks and identified the following ML methods as the most commonly used: LR, C4.5, NB, SVM, ANN and RF.

Confidence in the interpretation of clinical symptoms and management of patients can be enhanced with the use of biomarkers and could provide clinicians with a tool to predict prognosis and mortality, allowing for earlier interventions and optimal resource allocation.In March 2020, clinicians approached CWPS requesting the provision of biomarkers, as highlighted in early publications. The aim of this change was to improve the clinical management of patients, remove the need for referral laboratory testing and ensure swift translation of recent evidence into clinical practice. Cost, method availability, IT requirements, assay verification, sample needs and appropriate testing were all considered when extending the scope of service. Continued dialogue with those leading the local COVID clinical pathway ensured the change was clinically supported and that testing was incorporated into the trust ward management strategies.Royal College of Pathology guidelines later published in April 2020 supported the service change and literature reviews continue to highlight the role of inflammatory markers for patient stratification;with a recent systematic review finding some of the included biomarkers increased in more severe infections. The Association of Clinical Biochemistry have also made a statement encouraging this type of innovation, utilising both scientific and medical staff in the improvement of patient care.In collaboration with statisticians from local universities, biomarker data is being interrogated so that any findings may be translated into practice. Currently, multiple regression analysis has allowed the creation of models to explain association of analytes with outcomes and it is hoped continued work will allow the creation of decisions trees and clinical reference values.","Braybrook, Emma Anderson Neil Randeva Harpal Patel Kiran Grammatopoulos Dimitris",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.196,735
173468,Pattern of errors in Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices and their use in the clinical assessment of intelligence,2021,"Algorithms implementing populations of agents which interact with one another and sense their environment may exhibit emergent behavior such as self-organization and swarm intelligence. Here a swarm system, called Databionic swarm (DBS), is introduced which is able to adapt itself to structures of high-dimensional data characterized by distance and/or density-based structures in the data space. By exploiting the interrelations of swarm intelligence, self-organization and emergence, DBS serves as an alternative approach to the optimization of a global objective function in the task of clustering. The swarm omits the usage of a global objective function and is parameter-free because it searches for the Nash equilibrium during its annealing process. To our knowledge, DBS is the first swarm combining these approaches. Its clustering can outperform common clustering methods such as K-means, PAM, single linkage, spectral clustering, model-based clustering, and Ward, if no prior knowledge about the data is available. A central problem in clustering is the correct estimation of the number of clusters. This is addressed by a DBS visualization called topographic map which allows assessing the number of clusters. It is known that all clustering algorithms construct clusters, irrespective of the data set contains clusters or not. In contrast to most other clustering algorithms, the topographic map identifies, that clustering of the data is meaningless if the data contains no (natural) clusters. The performance of DBS is demonstrated on a set of benchmark data, which are constructed to pose difficult clustering problems and in two real-world applications.","Thrun, Michael C.; Ultsch, Alfred",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05521v1.pdf,735

This study compared early post-vaccination symptoms in individuals who subsequently tested positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2, using data from the COVID Symptom Study (CSS) app. Design: We conducted a prospective observational study in UK CSS participants who were asymptomatic when vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) or Oxford-AstraZeneca adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) between 8 December 2020 and 17 May 2021, who subsequently reported symptoms within seven days (other than local symptoms at injection site) and were tested for SARS-CoV-2, aiming to differentiate vaccination side-effects per se from superimposed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The post-vaccination symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 test results were contemporaneously logged by participants. Demographic and clinical information (including comorbidities) were also recorded. Symptom profiles in individuals testing positive were compared with a 1:1 matched population testing negative, including using machine learning and multiple models including UK testing criteria. Findings: Differentiating post-vaccination side-effects alone from early COVID-19 was challenging, with a sensitivity in identification of individuals testing positive of 0.6 at best. A majority of these individuals did not have fever, persistent cough, or anosmia/dysosmia, requisite symptoms for accessing UK testing; and many only had systemic symptoms commonly seen post-vaccination in individuals negative for SARS-CoV-2 (headache, myalgia, and fatigue). Interpretation: Post-vaccination side-effects per se cannot be differentiated from COVID-19 with clinical robustness, either using symptom profiles or machine-derived models. Individuals presenting with systemic symptoms post-vaccination should be tested for SARS-CoV-2, to prevent community spread.

173890,Green Design of Prefabricated Community Control Measures in Response to Public Health Emergencies,2021,"Background: With the emergence of the global coronavirus pandemic, increasing concerns have been raised about the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with immune-mediated disorders. Objectives: In this study we aimed to assess the time course of proven SARSCoV-2 infection, development of humoral immunity with detectable antibodies to the virus and evaluate any changes in antibody titres over time. Methods: We recruited 114 participants in total who had potential symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Participants were recruited from rheumatology or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) clinics from their records who attended a London Teaching hospital for care. Ethical Approval was in place for the study. Age-and gender-matched control participants without any underlying rheumatological condition/IBD were recruited as a comparator group. Clinical symptoms for COVID-19 infection were assessed using the COVID-19 Rheumatology Global Alliance assessment criteria (https://rheum-covid.org/). Information about Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (DMARD) drug use was also recorded. Participants' serum samples were collected for quantitative serological assessment of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using the Mologic Enzyme-Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA) IgG kit. The optical density values were plotted aganist time using a normalisation as previously described (1). A cut-off above 0 indicated positive serology. Results: A total of 114 subjects were recruited into the study. Subjects were recruited if they had suspected Covid symptoms. Of the population recruited, the total number subsequently testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was n=59 (either on serology or PCR). The number of subjects with autoimmune conditions diagnosed with COVID-19 was 32, with 30 subjects being symptomatic (the asymptomatic 2 subjects were excluded from further analyses). Of the 30 symptomatic subjects, the average age was 56, with a female to male ratio of 19:11. The most prevalent diagnoses were RA (30%), Psoriatic Arthritis (16.7%), SLE (10%), sarcoidosis 10%), Ulcerative Colitis (10%), Crohn's disease (10%), seronegative inflammatory arthritis (6.7%), Sjogren's (3.3%) and Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (3.3%). The majority were on csDMARDs (60%), biologic DMARDs (20%), tacrolimus (3.3%) and the remaining 16.7% were not on DMARDs. Most subjects required treatment in hospital (56.7%), a smaller number required high dependency care (6.7%) and the rest were treated at home (36.6%). The majority required no oxygen (63.3%), with a further 30% requiring oxygen and 6.7% needed more supportive care i.e. CPAP/ventilation. We also had a matched control group (n=29) of subjects who developed SARS-CoV-2 but had no underlying autoimmune conditions. These subjects had a mean age of 55, female: male ratio 18: 11. Of these 31% had home management, 55.2% had ward level treatments and 13.8% had intensive care treatment. Of the controls, 48.3% did not require oxygen, 37.9% needed simple oxygen and 13.8% were on CPAP. A total of 35 subjects from the original study have attended for follow-up visits. Antibody titres for IgG using the Mologic ELISA detection assay were compared at two visits for the control and autoimmune group. Results showed that subjects with autoimmune conditions and those without who developed SARS-CoV-2 showed very similar antibody titres by optical density (OD) (Figure 1) and maintained antibody responses beyond 6 months in most cases. Conclusion: Serological assays can assist in the understanding of disease severity of SAR-CoV-2 infection. They can be a useful tool for patient surveillance, especially in people who are on immunomodulatory drugs and are being seen in Rheumatology services. Future work is needed to assess the duration and potential protective nature of humoral antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.","Biddle, K.; Koushesh, S.; Blundell, A.; Clark, D.; Krishna, S.; Sofat, N.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.1736,735

The sample consisted of 423 participants (M = 30.29, SD = 14.45;69% female). Compliance, risk perception and trust in information were significantly higher in T1 than T2. For risk perception, significant predictors in both T1 and T2 were age, Emotionality (HEXACO-PI-R) and Unrealistic Optimism (NLE, Negative Life Events). Trust in information was a significant predictor in T1, while Unrealistic Optimism (Positive Life Events) was a significant predictor in T2. For compliance, significant predictors in T1 were gender and trust in information while in T2 were Emotionality, Extraversion, Conscientiousness (HEXACO-PI-R), NLE and trust in information, for both T1 and T2. In general, findings suggest a much more pronounced role of personality traits in adherence to protective measures at the end than at the beginning of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Serbia. Also, the results indicate the role of unrealistic optimism regarding negative life events in lower compliance with protective measures. © 2020 Faculty of Philosophy, University of Novi Sad, Serbia.

176978,Classification of Corona Virus Infected Chest X-ray using Deep Convolutional Neural Network,2021,"Background: There are reported concerns of patient misunderstanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination safety. It is particularly important that these are understood in patients taking complex immunusuppressive therapies. Rapid delivery of targeted and up-to-date video messages from clinicians sent directly to patients could address patient uncertainty, and improve COVID-19 vaccination uptake. Innovative SMS (short message service) based video message has already shown promise in delivering COVID-19 information to patients [1]. We present our experience in creating a tailored vaccine information video sent directly to our large cohort of patients in the UK with a range of rheumatic diseases and report on the learning points going forward. Objectives: Our three objectives were: (1) educate our patients using an interactive mobile video information resource outlining the safety of the COVID vaccination in these patient groups;(2) better understand our patients' views of the COVID-19 vaccine;(3) evaluate the patient experience of this approach. Methods: We designed and recorded an 8-minute interactive web-based video delivered education resource designed for mobile phones. This included: aims of the video;details of licenced vaccines;UK vaccination schedule;frequently asked questions;links to national charity resources;our clinician recommendations;a rheumatologist being vaccinated;case studies;and summary data. We produced a simple mobile phone web-based evaluation of the resource, including anonymised patient demographics, their understanding of the safety of the vaccine pre/ post video, and their user experience. Resource and evaluation were piloted by local healthcare professionals, our Patient Participation Group, a national charity, and approved by senior management. We distributed this to our follow-up patient cohort via our hospital SMS provider on 21.12.20, at the start of roll-out of UK vaccines, containing a link to the resource and evaluation. Results: Of a cohort of 10,981 patients, we had 8886 mobile phone numbers. At Day 14, we recorded 2358 video views (26.3%) and 664/2358 completed evaluations (28.1%). Only one person reported being unable to watch the video. Before watching the video, 348/664 patients (52.4%) were unsure if the vaccine was safe and/or recommended for them, rising to 626/664 (94.3%) post-video. Reasons for uncertainty after the video (38/664) included drug allergy and fertility concerns. Following the video, 509/664 patients (76.6%) reported that they were more likely to have the vaccination. The majority of the patients (614/660, 93.0%) agreed that the method was a helpful method to share such information.Age distribution of our whole cohort, patients with mobile phones, and responders were similar: Age >50 was 80.4%,76.3%,and 88.6% respectively. A large proportion was treated with immunosuppressive medication (61.3% conventional DMARD, 39.4% biological DMARD and 17.6% corticosteroids). Gender and case mix for responders were similar to published data from our cohort: female 74.0%;rheumatoid arthritis commonest disease (389/664, 58.5%). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show the potential for SMS linked interactive multimedia message for patient education. The multimedia component allows users to easily navigate to relevant sections, and access a choice of linked resources. We demonstrate this low-cost technology is simple, effective and well placed to assist physicians in educating patients during a time when face-to-face contact is proving to be difficult. We have shown high levels of patient satisfaction, reassurance, and self-reported behaviour change. Such technology has potential utility for national bodies, primary and secondary care groups, and merits further research.","Rajagopala, L.; Ford, M.; Jasim, M.; Mulherin, D.; Venkatachalam, S.; Sheeran, T.; Bateman, J.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.1778,735
177154,Corona Virus Detection and Classification with Radiograph images using RNN,2021,"Human risk has further increased within the global maritime industry because of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. It also impacted the economic activity within the Caribbean islands, including its ship–shore delivery sector. Traditionally, this service includes human interface presenting safety and health hazards, and vessels employed operate on fossil fuels, releasing emissions that contribute to harmful GHG and air pollution. Opportunities have arisen for local maritime companies to introduce innovative strategies within the industry to rectify these challenges. Implementing unmanned aerial system (UAS) technology can reduce operational costs, human risk, environmental impact, and delivery time. This study assessed the feasibility of a UAS ship–shore delivery service to optimize near-harbor deliveries within six major ports of Trinidad. Data was gathered through field observations, a literature survey, questionnaires, and interviews with relevant stakeholders. Based on the above approach, the needs of the local ship–shore delivery sector were identified and categorized. An appropriate UAS which addressed these needs while maintaining the economic, environmental, and human safety requirements was then identified. Recommendations for overcoming the local implementation and operational challenges that were encountered are presented. This study may serve as a reference for conceptualizing a UAS ship–shore delivery service and offers resolutions for similar implementation challenges.","Sookram, Noel Ramsewak Deanesh Singh Sukhjit",Drones,https://doi.org/10.3390/drones5030076,735

Following consideration of the public transport sector response to the pandemic and the emerging literature context, we explore three principal questions: (i) How has weekly travel composition changed across the waves? (ii) How has level of concern with using public transport changed over the course of the pandemic given new bio-security concerns? and (iii) How has attitudes to risk been associated with the changes in PT use? A key finding is that concerns over bio-security issues around public transport are enduring, that concern about hygiene is significantly negatively related to public transport use and that those with higher concern about the hygiene of public transport also held higher concern about COVID-19 at work. Even as COVID-19 restrictions are eased, both concern about crowds and hygiene have a significant and negative correlation with public transport use. Concluding remarks are offered on what might need to happen for public transport patronage to start returning.","Beck, Matthew J.; Hensher, David A.; Nelson, John D.",Journal of Transport Geography,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2021.103167,735

Reports suggest that RhD-negative individuals are better protected against infectious diseases and have overall better health. However, potential mechanisms contributing to these associations have not yet been defined. Here, we used transcriptomic and genomic data from the Milieu Interieur cohort of 1000 healthy individuals to explore the effect of RhD on immune responses. We used the rs590787 SNP in the RHD gene to classify the 1000 donors as either RhD-positive or -negative. Whole blood was stimulated with LPS, polyIC, and the live influenza A virus and the NanoString human immunology panel of 560 genes used to assess donor immune response and to investigate sex specific effects. Using regression analysis, we observed no significant differences in responses to polyIC or LPS between RhD-positive and -negative individuals. However, upon sex-specific analysis, we observed over 30 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between RhD-positive (n=401) and RhD-negative males (n=78). Interestingly these Rhesus-associated differences were not seen in females. Further investigation, using gene set enrichment analysis, revealed enhanced IFN{gamma} signalling in RhD-negative males. This amplified IFN{gamma} signalling axis may explain the increased viral resistance previously described in RhD-negative individuals.","Sugrue, J.

181005,Synthetic Target Domain Supervision for Open Retrieval QA,2021,"In the vestibular peripheral organs, type I and type II hair cells (HCs) transmit incoming signals via glutamatergic quantal transmission onto afferent nerve fibers. Additionally, type I HCs transmit via ‘non-quantal’ transmission to calyx afferent fibers, by accumulation of glutamate and potassium in the synaptic cleft. Vestibular efferent inputs originating in the brainstem contact type II HCs and vestibular afferents. Here, we aimed at characterizing the synaptic efferent inputs to type II HCs using electrical and optogenetic stimulation of efferent fibers combined with in vitro whole-cell patch clamp recording from type II HCs in the rodent vestibular crista. Properties of efferent synaptic currents in type II HCs were similar to those found in cochlear hair cells and mediated by activation of α9/α10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and SK potassium channels. While efferents showed a low probability of release at low frequencies of stimulation, repetitive stimulation resulted in facilitation and increased probability of release. Notably, the membrane potential of type II HCs measured during optogenetic stimulation of efferents showed a strong hyperpolarization even in response to single pulses and was further enhanced by repetitive stimulation. Such efferent-mediated inhibition of type II HCs can provide a mechanism to adjust the contribution of signals from type I and type II HCs to vestibular nerve fibers. As a result, the relative input of type I hair cells to vestibular afferents will be strengthened, emphasizing the phasic properties of the incoming signal that are transmitted via fast non-quantal transmission. New and Noteworthy Type II vestibular hair cells (HCs) receive inputs from efferent fibers originating in the brainstem. We used in vitro optogenetic and electrical stimulation of efferent fibers to study their synaptic inputs to type II HCs. Efferent inputs inhibited type II HCs, similar to cochlear efferent effects. We propose that efferent inputs adjust the contribution of signals from type I and type II HCs that report different components of the incoming signal to vestibular nerve fibers.","Yu, Zhou; McIntosh, J.

In order to understand qualitatively those observations, we divided the city in three regions controlled by the government, by the drug gangs and by the \textit{mil\'icias}, respectively, and we consider a SIRD-like epidemic model where the three regions are coupled. Considering different levels of exposure, the model is capable to reproduce qualitatively the distinct evolution of the COVID-19 disease in the three regions, suggesting that the organized crime shapes the COVID-19 evolution in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

213510,Gabor-Deep CNN based Masked Face Recognition for Fraud Prevention,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised several issues regarding the management of surgical patients. The aim of the current study was to clarify the management of oncologic and surgical patients during the pandemic. METHODS: Relevant publications reporting on the epidemiology of the pandemic, the diagnosis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and the clinical management of cancer and surgical patients, as well as studies concerning health care workers' safety, were included. The last date of research for this study was April 4, 2020. RESULTS: We analyzed 28 papers. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and computed tomography scans were considered useful for cases of diagnostic uncertainty. Cancer patients and surgical patients were confirmed to be particularly at risk of infection and negative outcome. To guarantee adequate care to these patients, while minimizing the risk for infection, the early postponing of elective surgery, the creation of COVID-free facilities and the identification of COVID- dedicated operating theaters and teams have been proposed. The correct use of personal protective equipment was also strongly advocated, along with the institution of facilities for the psychologic support of health care workers. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the importance of providing adequate care to patients with urgent and nondeferrable clinical issues, such as cancer.

223373,GitHub-OSS Fixit: Fixing bugs at scale in a Software Engineering Course,2020-11-29,"BACKGROUND: As policy makers continue to shape the national and local responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, the information they choose to share and how they frame their content provide key insights into the public and health care systems. OBJECTIVE: We examined the language used by the members of the US House and Senate during the first 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and measured content and sentiment based on the tweets that they shared. METHODS: We used Quorum (Quorum Analytics Inc) to access more than 300,000 tweets posted by US legislators from January 1 to October 10, 2020. We used differential language analyses to compare the content and sentiment of tweets posted by legislators based on their party affiliation. RESULTS: We found that health care-related themes in Democratic legislators' tweets focused on racial disparities in care (odds ratio [OR] 2.24, 95% CI 2.22-2.27; P<.001), health care and insurance (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.7-1.77; P<.001), COVID-19 testing (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.12-1.19; P<.001), and public health guidelines (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.22-1.29; P<.001). The dominant themes in the Republican legislators' discourse included vaccine development (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.47-1.55; P<.001) and hospital resources and equipment (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.18-1.25). Nonhealth care-related topics associated with a Democratic affiliation included protections for essential workers (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.52-1.59), the 2020 election and voting (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.27-1.35), unemployment and housing (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.24-1.31), crime and racism (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.18-1.26), public town halls (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.16-1.23), the Trump Administration (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.19-1.26), immigration (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.12-1.19), and the loss of life (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.35-1.42). The themes associated with the Republican affiliation included China (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.85-1.92), small business assistance (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.23-1.3), congressional relief bills (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.2-1.27), press briefings (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.19-1.26), and economic recovery (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.16-1.23).

228633,"Hybrid energy system for Dier El Balah quarantine center in Gaza Strip, Palestine",2021,"Notified cases of COVID-19 and associated deaths reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) to 7 June 2020. Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 7 June 2020: notifications = 7,277; deaths = 102. Over the past fortnightly reporting period, the number of new cases in all jurisdictions continues to decline, or remain very low, and testing rates continue to be high across all jurisdictions, with the positivity rate remaining very low at less than 0.1%. The incidence of COVID-19 has markedly reduced since a peak in mid-March. A combination of early case identification, physical distancing, public health measures and a reduction in international travel have been effective in slowing the spread of disease in Australia. Of the 147 cases notified between 25 May and 7 June, 63% acquired their infection overseas. The proportion of cases locally acquired has dropped substantially to 28% of new cases this period compared with 50% and greater observed since 30 March 2020. Of the cases considered to be locally-acquired over this period, most were associated with contacts of confirmed cases or were associated with known outbreaks. A small proportion of overall cases have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.4%. People who are older and have one or more comorbidities are more likely to experience severe disease. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 65-79 years. Three-quarters of all cases in this age group have been associated with overseas travel, including several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in children under 18, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, as of 7 June 2020, the largest numbers of both cases and deaths have been reported in the United States. Of the confirmed cases reported globally, the case fatality rate is approximately 5.8%. Countries in South America are seeing rapid growth in case numbers, while the United States is seeing a steady decline in its daily new case numbers. Case numbers in Europe remain relatively steady, with several countries in Eastern Europe experiencing rapid growth. In the South East Asia region, India and Bangladesh are seeing accelerating epidemics, compounded by the recovery from Cyclone Amphan. Reported cases are increasing in Africa, although the numbers are much smaller. In the Pacific there are few new cases reported daily.",,,,735
245256,Washington state's COVID‐19 shutdown had immediate effect on drinking,2020,"With more than 1,800,000 cases and 110,000 deaths globally, COVID-19 is one of worst infectious disease outbreaks in history. This paper provides a critical review of the available evidence regarding the lessons learned from the Chinese experience with COVID-19 prevention and management. The steps that have led to a near disappearance of new cases in China included rapid sequencing of the virus to establish testing kits, which allowed tracking of infected persons in and out of Wuhan. In addition, aggressive quarantine measures included the complete isolation of Wuhan and then later Hubei Province and the rest of the country, as well as closure of all schools and nonessential businesses. Other measures included the rapid construction of two new hospitals and the establishment of ""Fangcang"" shelter hospitals. In the absence of a vaccine, the management of COVID-19 included antivirals, high-flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, interferons, intravenous immunoglobulin, and convalescent plasma infusions. These measures appeared to provide only moderate success. Although some measures have been supported by weak descriptive data, their effectiveness is still unclear pending well controlled clinical trials. In the end, it was the enforcement of drastic quarantine measures that stopped SARS-CoV-2 from spreading. The earlier the implementation, the less likely resources will be depleted. The most critical factors in stopping a pandemic are early recognition of infected individuals, carriers, and contacts and early implementation of quarantine measures with an organised, proactive, and unified strategy at a national level. Delays result in significantly higher death tolls.","Peng, Fujun; Tu, Lei; Yang, Yongshi; Hu, Peng; Wang, Runsheng; Hu, Qinyong; Cao, Feng; Jiang, Taijiao; Sun, Jinlyu; Xu, Guogang; Chang, Christopher",Can J Cardiol,,735

296089,An End-to-End Security Framework for Smart Healthcare Information Sharing against Botnet-based Cyber-Attacks,2021,"BACKGROUND: Traditional radiology fellowships are usually one or two year clinical trainings in a specific area after completion of a four-year residency. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the experience of fellowship applicants in answering radiology questions in an audiovisual format, using their own smartphones after answering radiology questions in a traditional printed text format as part of the application process during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our hypothesis is that fellowship applicants would find that recorded audiovisual radiology content adds value to the conventional selection process, may increase engagement by using their own smartphone device, and also facilitate understanding of imaging findings of radiology-based questions, while maintaining social distancing. METHODS: One senior staff radiologist of each subspecialty prepared 4 audiovisual radiology questions for each subspecialty. We conducted a survey using online questionnaires for 123 fellowship applications for musculoskeletal (39), internal medicine (61) and neuroradiology (23) programs to evaluate the experience of using audiovisual radiology content as a substitute for the conventional text evaluation. RESULTS: The great majority of the applicants (99%) answered positively (agree or strongly agree) that images in digital forms have superior quality than printed in paper. Eighty-two percent of the applicants agreed with the statement that the presentation of the cases in audiovisual format facilitates the understanding of the findings. Also, most of the candidates agreed or strongly agreed that answering digital forms is more practical than conventional paper forms (65%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of audiovisual content as part of the selection process for radiology fellowships is a new approach to evaluate the potential to enhance the applicant's experience during this process. This technology also allows for the evaluation of candidates without the necessity of in-person interactions. Further studies could streamline these methods in order to minimize work redundancy with traditional text tests or even evaluate the acceptance of using only audiovisual content using smartphones.","Godoy, Ivan Rodrigues Barros; Neto, Luís Pecci; Skaf, Abdalla; Leão-Filho, Hilton Muniz; Freddi, Tomás De Andrade Lourenço; Jasinowodolinski, Dany; Yamada, André Fukunishi",,,735
304517,Secure Multiparty computation enabled E-Healthcare system with Homomorphic encryption,2020,"COVID-19 disease in humans, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, was first reported in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. This disease has quickly developed into a global pandemic, resulting in over 350,000 deaths worldwide and over 5 million confirmed infections in a matter of 6 months. Although the genome of this novel viral RNA was sequenced quickly and testing kits were manufactured to assist in combatting COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment will remain relatively unsuccessful until the pathology of this disease is fully understood. Histotechnology plays an important role in understanding the pathology of many diseases, including COVID-19. The first postmortem biopsy of a COVID-19 patient was collected on 27 January 2020, and the pathology finding was published in mid-February 2020. Since then, more studies have been published in scientific literatures as the global outbreak continues. This mini-review summarizes the published articles in which histotechnology aspects were utilized with the intent to understand the pathology of COVID-19. In addition, it is anticipated there will be more molecular and immunohistochemical studies to further understand the mechanism of the disease in the near future.","Malloy, Seth; Wang, Yongfu",J Histotechnol,,735

316654,Application of deep learning strategies to assess COVID-19 patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: Online education became mandatory for many students during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and blurred the distinction between settings where processes of stress and restoration used to take place. The lockdown also likely changed perceptions of the indoor acoustic environment (i.e., soundscape) and raised its importance. In the present study, we seek to understand how indoor soundscape related to university students' self-rated health in Bulgaria around the time that the country was under a state of emergency declaration caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Between 17 May and 10 June 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional online survey among 323 students (median age 21 years; 31% male) from two universities in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Self-rated health (SRH) was measured with a single-item. Participants were asked how frequently they heard different types of sounds while at home and how pleasant they considered each of those sounds to be. Restorative quality of the home (the ""being away"" dimension of the Perceived Restorativeness Scale) was measured with a single-item. A priori confounders and effect modifiers included sociodemographics, house-related characteristics, general sensitivity to environmental influences, and mental health. Our analysis strategy involved sequential exploratory factor analysis (EFA), multivariate linear and ordinal regressions, effect modification tests, and structural equation modeling (SEM). RESULTS: EFA supported grouping perceived sounds into three distinct factors-mechanical, human, and nature sounds. Regression analyses revealed that greater exposure to mechanical sounds was consistently associated with worse SRH, whereas no significant associations were found for human and nature sounds. In SEM, exposure to mechanical sounds related to lower restorative quality of the home, and then to poorer SRH, whereas nature sounds correlated with higher restorative quality, and in turn with better SRH. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a role of positive indoor soundscape and restorative quality for promoting self-rated health in times of social distancing.","Dzhambov, Angel M; Lercher, Peter; Stoyanov, Drozdstoy; Petrova, Nadezhda; Novakov, Stoyan; Dimitrova, Donka D",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,735

OBJECTIVES: To describe clinical features and outcome of COVID-19 in patients older than 85 years and study risk factors for mortality. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Patients aged 85 years and older, admitted in noncritical care units at the University Hospital Lariboisière Fernand-Widal (Paris, France) for confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were included and followed up for 21 days. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical and laboratory findings were collected. Cox survival analysis was performed to explore factors associated with death. RESULTS: From March 14 to April 11, 2020, 76 patients (median age = 90 (86-92) years; women = 55.3%) were admitted for confirmed COVID-19. Of the patients, 64.5% presented with three or more comorbidities. Most common symptoms were asthenia (76.3%), fever (75.0%) and confusion and delirium (71.1%). An initial fall was reported in 25.0% of cases, and digestive symptoms were reported in 22.4% of cases. COVID-19 was severe in 51.3% of cases, moderate in 32.9%, and mild in 15.8%. Complications included acute respiratory syndrome (28.9%), cardiac decompensation (14.5%), and hypotensive shock (9.0%). Fatality at 21 days was 28.9%, after a median course of disease of 13 (8-17) days. Males were overrepresented in nonsurvivors (68.2%). In survivors, median length of stay was 12 (9-19.5) days. Independent predictive factors of death were C-reactive protein level at admission and lymphocyte count at nadir.

Drawing on the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM), our survey analysis (n= 1,106) revealed that those obtaining COVID-19 information from conservative media and Trump briefings were less likely to believe that COVID-19 is a serious threat (perceived threat) and that recommended preventive behaviors are effective and feasible (perceived efficacy). These beliefs, in turn, resulted in their decreased intentions to adopt risk preventative behaviors. In contrast, those who got COVID-19 information from liberal media, health organizations' briefings, and traditional media reported heightened threat and efficacy perception, which, in turn, led to their willingness to take risk preventive actions.","Chung, Myojung; Jones-Jang, S Mo",Health Commun,,735

We assessed the post-licensure safety data for IIV3-HD in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 2011-2019. METHODS: We searched VAERS for reports after IIV3-HD during 1/1/2011-06/30/2019 in persons aged &#8805;65 years. Medical records were reviewed for all death reports and for certain pre-specified conditions (e.g. Guillain Barré Syndrome [GBS], anaphylaxis). We also reviewed certain groups who received IIV3-HD erroneously (e.g. pregnant women, children). Empirical Bayesian data mining was used to identify disproportional reporting. RESULTS: VAERS received 12,320 reports after IIV3-HD;723 reports (5.9%) were serious. The most common adverse events (AEs) among serious reports were pyrexia (30.2%), asthenia (28.9%), and dyspnea (24.9%), and among non-serious reports were injection site erythema (16.8%), pain in extremity (15.8%), and injection site pain (14.2%). Among 55 death reports, the most common causes of death were diseases of the circulatory system (n = 23;41.8%). Based on medical record review, there were 61 reports of GBS and 13 of anaphylaxis. There were 13 reports of pregnant-women who inadvertently received IIV3-HD; three reports described arm pain or local reactions, and 10 did not report any AE. Among 59 reports of children who erroneously received IIV3-HD, 31 experienced an AE (most commonly injection site or constitutional reactions) and the remaining 28 reports did not describe any AE. CONCLUSIONS: Post-licensure safety data of IIV3-HD during 9 influenza seasons revealed no new or unexpected safety concerns among individuals &#8805;65 years. Inadvertent administration of IIV3-HD to children or pregnant women was observed, although with no serious AEs reported. Training and education of providers in vaccine recommendations and groups for whom the vaccine is indicated may help in preventing these vaccine administration errors. This review provides baseline information for future monitoring of the quadrivalent-high-dose influenza vaccine.","Moro, Pedro L; Woo, Emily Jane; Marquez, Paige; Cano, Maria",Vaccine,,735
393219,Serology-positive but minimally symptomatic COVID-19 may still cause lung injury and lung function impairment,2020,"INTRODUCTION: We present the report of the first, to our best knowledge, case of COVID-19 in a tetraplegic person. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old male with AIS A C4 tetraplegia developed fever during the night, without any prodrome. His general practitioner suspected a urinary tract infection and prescribed him antibiotic therapy. After 2 days of antibiotic therapy the fever still persisted, so the individual was admitted to the local hospital and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. After 2 days he was transferred to our spinal unit. Considering the worsening of the chest X-ray and fever despite 48 h of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, we strongly suspected viral pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 was detected and antiviral therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir, associated with hydroxychloroquine, was promptly started. Fever ceased after 2 days of therapy. DISCUSSION: Blood test and chest X-ray findings in this patient were similar to previously published findings regarding COVID-19. One difference between this case and the known clinical course of COVID-19 is that did not develop cough. Another interesting feature of our case is that, despite tetraplegia, the clinical course was not severe. Persons with COVID-19 remain asymptomatic, these results underscore the need for rehabilitation and SCI professionals to have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in their inpatient and outpatient clients. Only inpatient with fever hase being tested for COVID-19. All new patients are submitted to SARS-COV-2 Test. Moreover, routine testing of patients who have to participate in therapy in common gym areas may be warranted.","Righi, Gabriele; Del Popolo, Giulio",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,,735

432244,Homemade XR: Enriching conversations and shortening social distancing,2021,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have described the clinical characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19), indicating severe patients tended to have higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Whether baseline NLR could be an independent predictor of in-hospital death in Chinese COVID-19 patients remains to be investigated. METHODS: A cohort of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1 to February 29 was retrospectively analyzed. The baseline data of laboratory examinations, including NLR, were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were developed to assess the independent relationship between the baseline NLR and in-hospital all-cause death. A sensitivity analysis was performed by converting NLR from a continuous variable to a categorical variable according to tertile. Interaction and stratified analyses were conducted as well. RESULTS: 245 COVID-19 patients were included in the final analyses, and the in-hospital mortality was 13.47%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that there was 8% higher risk of in-hospital mortality for each unit increase in NLR (Odds ratio [OR]â¯=â¯1.08; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01 to 1.14; Pâ¯=â¯0.0147). Compared with patients in the lowest tertile, the NLR of patients in the highest tertile had a 15.04-fold higher risk of death (ORâ¯=â¯16.04; 95% CI, 1.14 to 224.95; Pâ¯=â¯0.0395) after adjustment for potential confounders. Notably, the fully adjusted OR for mortality was 1.10 in males for each unit increase of NLR (ORâ¯=â¯1.10; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.19; Pâ¯=â¯0.016). CONCLUSIONS: NLR is an independent risk factor of the in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients especially for male. Assessment of NLR may help identify high risk individuals with COVID-19.","Liu, Yuwei; Du, Xuebei; Chen, Jing; Jin, Yalei; Peng, Li; Wang, Harry H X; Luo, Mingqi; Chen, Ling; Zhao, Yan",J Infect,,735
432245,Homemade XR: Enriching conversations and shortening social distancing,2021,"Imaging the Eustachian tube is challenging because of its complex anatomy and limited accessibility. This study fabricated a fiber-based optical coherence tomography (OCT) catheter and investigated its potential for assessing the Eustachian tube anatomy. A customized OCT system and an imaging catheter, termed the Eustachian OCT, were developed for visualizing the Eustachian tube. Three male swine cadaver heads were used to study OCT image acquisition and for subsequent histologic correlation. The imaging catheter was introduced through the nasopharyngeal opening and reached toward the middle ear. The OCT images were acquired from the superior to the nasopharyngeal opening before and after Eustachian tube balloon dilatation. The histological anatomy of the Eustachian tube was compared with corresponding OCT images, The new, Eustachian OCT catheter was successfully inserted in the tubal lumen without damage. Cross-sectional images of the tube were successfully obtained, and the margins of the anatomical structures including cartilage, mucosa lining, and fat could be successfully delineated. After balloon dilatation, the expansion of the cross-sectional area could be identified from the OCT images. Using the OCT technique to assess the Eustachian tube anatomy was shown to be feasible, and the fabricated OCT image catheter was determined to be suitable for Eustachian tube assessment.","Byun, Hayoung; Kim, Yeon Hoon; Xing, Jingchao; Shin, Su-Jin; Lee, Seung Hwan; Yoo, Hongki; Chung, Jae Ho",Sci Rep,,735

Understanding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral clearance profile is crucial to establish a re-testing plan on discharge and ending isolation of patients. We aimed to evaluate the number of days that a patient needed to achieve undetectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal swab and/or an oropharyngeal swab). The clearance and persistence of viral RNA was evaluated in two groups of positive patients: those who achieved two negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and those who kept testing positive. Patients were organized thereafter in two subgroups, mild illness patients discharged home and inpatients who had moderate to severe illness. Results from RT-PCR tests were then correlated with results from the evaluation of the immune response. The study evidenced that most patients tested positive for more than 2 weeks and that persistence of viral RNA is not necessarily associated with severe disease but may result from a weaker immune response instead.","Carmo, Anália; Pereira-Vaz, João; Mota, Vanda; Mendes, Alexandra; Morais, Célia; da Silva, Andreia Coelho; Camilo, Elisabete; Pinto, Catarina Silva; Cunha, Elizabete; Pereira, Janet; Coucelo, Margarida; Martinho, Patrícia; Correia, Lurdes; Marques, Gilberto; Araújo, Lucília; Rodrigues, Fernando",J. med. virol,,735

At admission, he had a normocytic anemia (Hb, 99 g/L) and acute kidney injury (creatinine at 161 µM). His parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were at 67.6 pico moles/l. A plain X-ray of the lumbar spine showed the presence of a lytic lesion in the L4 vertebrae. CT and MRI confirmed this to be a destructive lesion. A subsequent pan CT scan showed a 2.8 cm complex nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid posteriorly. Excisional biopsy of the resected mass was associated with an infiltrative cellular parathyroid neoplasm with solid and nested architectural growth pattern admixed with hemorrhage and focal calcifications. The tumor showed lymphovascular and perineural invasion. At the time of workup and despite the absence of a positive SPEP/UPEP, a bone marrow biopsy was requested to rule out multiple myeloma. His normocellular bone marrow biopsy showed marked paratrabecular fibrosis and extensive bony remodelling but no metastatic invasion. The diagnosis of a metastatic parathyroid carcinoma was made. He is subsequently considered for palliative radiotherapy to the primary tumor bed and the lumbar spine. In addition, a role for immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab in context of clinical trials is envisioned and he is being considered for enrollment.","Moshref Razavi, Habib; Alaghehbandan, Reza",Case Rep Hematol,,735

Severe pneumonia occurred as a result of cytokine storm in some patients who needed intensive care unit (ICU), and it is aimed to determine the precursive parameters in this situation. Also in this study, the aim is to identify laboratory criteria that predict worsening disease and ICU intensification, as well as the development of cytokine storm. This article comprises a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to a single institution with COVID-19 pneumonia. This study includes 150 confirmed COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia. When they were considered as severe pneumonia patients, the clinic and laboratory parameters of this group are compared with H-score criteria. Patients are divided into two subgroups; patients with worsened symptoms who were transferred into tertiary ICU, and patients with stable symptoms followed in the clinic. For the patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, after they become complicated with severe pneumonia, lymphocytopenia (55.3%), anemia (12.0%), thrombocytopenia (19.3%), hyperferritinemia (72.5%), hyperfibrinogenemia (63.7%) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (90.8%), aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) (31.3%), alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) (20.7%) are detected. There were no significant changes in other parameters. Blood parameters between the pre-ICU period and the ICU period (in which their situation had been worsened and acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] was developed) were also compared. In the latter group lymphocyte levels were found significantly reduced (p = 0.01), and LDH, highly sensitive troponin (hs-troponin), procalcitonin, and triglyceride levels were significantly increased (p < 0.05). In addition, there was no change in hemoglobin, leukocyte, platelet, ferritin, and liver function test levels, including patients who developed ARDS, similar to the cytokine storm developed in MAS/sHLH. COVID-19 pneumonia has similar findings as hyperinflammatory syndromes but does not seem to have typical features as in cytokine storm developed in MAS/sHLH. In the severe patient group who has started to develop ARDS signs, a decrease in lymphocyte level in addition to the elevated LDH, hs-troponin, procalcitonin, and triglyceride levels can be a predictor in progression to ICU admission and could help in the planning of anti-cytokine therapy.","Gürsoy, Bengül; Sürmeli, Cemile D; Alkan, Mustafa; Satici, Celal; Altunok, Elif Sargin; Kamat, Sadettin; Demirok, Berna; Demirkol, Mustafa A; Börü, Akaberk",J Med Virol,,735

Objective: To characterize symptoms of pediatric COVID-19 in the community and analyze the association between symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels, as approximated by cycle threshold (Ct) values, in children and adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used a respiratory virus surveillance platform in persons of all ages to detect community COVID-19 cases from March 23 to November 9, 2020. A population-based convenience sample of children younger than 18 years and adults in King County, Washington, who enrolled online for home self-collection of upper respiratory samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing were included. Exposures: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from participant-collected samples. Main Outcomes and Measures: RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with Ct values stratified by age and symptoms. Results: Among 555 SARS-CoV-2-positive participants (mean [SD] age, 33.7 [20.1] years; 320 were female [57.7%]), 47 of 123 children (38.2%) were asymptomatic compared with 31 of 432 adults (7.2%). When symptomatic, fewer symptoms were reported in children compared with adults (mean [SD], 1.6 [2.0] vs 4.5 [3.1]). Symptomatic individuals had lower Ct values (which corresponded to higher viral RNA levels) than asymptomatic individuals (adjusted estimate for children, -3.0; 95% CI, -5.5 to -0.6; P = .02; adjusted estimate for adults, -2.9; 95% CI, -5.2 to -0.6; P = .01). The difference in mean Ct values was neither statistically significant between symptomatic children and symptomatic adults (adjusted estimate, -0.7; 95% CI, -2.2 to 0.9; P = .41) nor between asymptomatic children and asymptomatic adults (adjusted estimate, -0.6; 95% CI, -4.0 to 2.8; P = .74). Conclusions and Relevance: In this community-based cross-sectional study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels, as determined by Ct values, were significantly higher in symptomatic individuals than in asymptomatic individuals and no significant age-related differences were found.

In particular, it has raised challenges in the context of competing care priorities between COVID-19 and cancer treatment. Residents on the front line face difficulties related to increasing care needs and urgent reorganization of health care systems while managing psychological stress and uncertainty. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on oncology residents. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We conducted a national survey (39 questions) in France among oncology and radiation therapy residents to determine the psychological impact and professional difficulties (eg, reassignment, training/research time, supervision, teleworking, management of patients) associated with the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Overall, 222 residents (medical oncologists, 61%; radiation therapists, 39%) participated in our survey, representing approximately one third of all residents and fellows in France. One third of respondents had been reassigned to a COVID-19 ward. Training and research activity decreased for 89% and 41% of respondents, respectively. Two thirds (70%) of respondents declared that they had faced ethical issues, 35% felt worried about their own health, and 23% experienced psychological distress. According to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 32% were anxious and 17% depressed. Consumption of tobacco, psychostimulants, and alcohol increased in 31%, 24%, and 29% of respondents, respectively. CONCLUSION: French oncology residents were highly affected by the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of professional activity and psychological impact. This national survey can be used as a basis for improved management, medical reorganization, and training of residents during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Hilmi, Marc; Boilève, Alice; Ducousso, Anabelle; Michalet, Morgan; Turpin, Anthony; Neuzillet, Cindy; Naoun, Natacha",JCO Glob Oncol,,735

519242,A Survey of Medical Image Analysis Using Deep Learning Approaches,2021,"Introduction. Clinical microbiology laboratories have had to cope with an increase in the volume of tests due to the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Short turnaround times (TATs) are important for case tracing and to help clinicians in patient management. In such a context, high-throughput systems are essential to process the bulk of the tests. Rapid tests are also required to ensure shorter TATs for urgent situations. In our laboratory, SARS-CoV-2 assays were initially implemented on our custom platform using a previously published method. The commercial cobas 6800 (Roche diagnostics) assay and the GeneXpert Xpress (Cepheid) SARS-CoV-2 assay were implemented on 24 March and 8 April 2020, respectively, as soon as available.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Despite the abundant literature on SARS-CoV-2 assays, the articles focus mainly on the diagnostic performances. This is to our knowledge the first article that specifically studies the TAT of different assays.Aim. We aimed to describe the impact of various SARS-CoV-2 assays on the TAT at the beginning of the outbreak.Methodology. In this study, we retrospectively analysed the TAT of all SARS-CoV-2 assays performed in our centre between 24 February and 9 June, 2020.Results. We retrieved 33â900 analyses, with a median TAT of 6.25 h. TATs were highest (6.9 h) when only our custom platform was used (24 February to 24 March, 2020). They were reduced to 6.1 h when the cobas system was introduced (24 March to 8 April, 2020). The implementation of the GeneXpert further reduced the median TAT to 4.8 h (8 April to 9 June, 2020). The GeneXpert system had the shortest median TAT (1.9 h), followed by the cobas (5.5 h) and by our custom platform (6.9 h).Conclusion. This work shows that the combination of high-throughput systems and rapid tests allows the efficient processing of a large number of tests with a short TAT. In addition, the use of a custom platform allowed the quick implementation of an in-house test when commercial assays were not yet available.","Marquis, Bastian; Opota, Onya; Jaton, Katia; Greub, Gilbert",J. medical microbiol,,735

604870,Investigations continue as SARS claims more lives,2003-04-12,"Objectives The aim of the study was to investigate the association between sex hormones and SARS-CoV-2 infection severity. Furthermore, the associations between sex hormones and systemic inflammation markers, viral shedding and length of patients’ hospitalization were studied. Design and Methods We conducted a case-control study, including 48 SARS-CoV-2 male patients, admitted to an Italian reference Hospital. The cases were composed by 24 patients with PaO2/FiO2 < 250 mmHg and needed ventilatory support (severe COVID-19). The controls were selected in a 1:1 ratio, matching by ages, among patients who may receive a low-flow oxygen supplementation (mild COVID-19). For each group, sex hormones at hospitalization were evaluated. Results Severe COVID-19 patients had a significantly lower Testosterone levels than mild COVID-19 patients. The median total testosterone (TT) was 1.4 ng/mL in cases and 3.5 ng/mL in controls (p = 0.005); the median bioavailable testosterone was 0.49 and 1.21 (p = 0.008); the median calculated Free Testosterone (cFT) was 0.029 ng/mL and 0.058 ng/mL (p = 0.015), respectively. Either low TT, low cFT and low BioT were correlated to the hyperinflammatory syndrome (p = 0.018, p = 0.048 and p = 0.020) and associated to a longer hospitalization (p = 0.052, p = 0.041 and p = 0.023), respectively. No association was found between hormones and duration of viral shedding nor mortality rate. Conclusions According to our data, lower level of Testosterone is a marker of clinical severity for COVID-19.","Camici, Marta; Zuppi, Paolo; Lorenzini, Patrizia; Scarnecchia, Liliana; Pinnetti, Carmela; Cicalini, Stefania; Nicastri, Emanuele; Petrosillo, Nicola; Palmieri, Fabrizio; D’Offizi, Gianpiero; Marchioni, Luisa; Gagliardini, Roberta; Baldelli, Roberto; Schininà, Vincenzo; Pianura, Elisa; Di Stefano, Federica; Curcio, Stefano; Ciavarella, Lucia; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Girardi, Enrico; Vaia, Francesco; Antinori, Andrea; Abbonizio, Maria Alessandra; Abdeddaim, Amina; Agostini, Elisabetta; Agrati, Chiara; Albarello, Fabrizio; Amadei, Gioia; Amendola, Alessandra; Antonica, Maria Assunta; Antonini, Mario; Bartoli, Tommaso Ascoli; Baldini, Francesco; Barbaro, Raffaella; Bartolini, Barbara; Bellagamba, Rita; Benigni, Martina; Bevilacqua, Nazario; Biava, Gianluigi; Bibas, Michele; Bordi, Licia; Bordoni, Veronica; Boumis, Evangelo; Branca, Marta; Buonomo, Rosanna; Busso, Donatella; Campioni, Paolo; Canichella, Flaminia; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Capone, Alessandro; Caporale, Cinzia; Caraffa, Emanuela; Caravella, Ilaria; Carletti, Fabrizio; Castilletti, Concetta; Cataldo, Adriana; Cerilli, Stefano; Cerva, Carlotta; Chiappini, Roberta; Chinello, Pierangelo; Cianfarani, Maria Assunta; Ciaralli, Carmine; Cimaglia, Claudia; Cinicola, Nicola; Ciotti, Veronica; Colavita, Francesca; Corpolongo, Angela; Cristofaro, Massimo; Curiale, Salvatore; D’Abramo, Alessandra; Dantimi, Cristina; Angelis, Alessia De; Angelis, Giada De; Palo, Maria Grazia De; Zottis, Federico De; Bari, Virginia Di; Lorenzo, Rachele Di; Stefano, Federica Di; Donno, Davide; Evangelista, Francesca; Faraglia, Francesca; Farina, Anna; Ferraro, Federica; Fiorentini, Lorena; Frustaci, Andrea; Fusetti, Matteo; Galati, Vincenzo; Gallì, Paola; Garotto, Gabriele; Gaviano, Ilaria; Tekle, Saba Gebremeskel; Giancola, Maria Letizia; Giansante, Filippo; Giombini, Emanuela; Granata, Guido; Greci, Maria Cristina; Grilli, Elisabetta; Grisetti, Susanna; Gualano, Gina; Iacomi, Fabio; Iaconi, Marta; Iannicelli, Giuseppina; Inversi, Carlo; Lalle, Eleonora; Lamanna, Maria Elena; Lanini, Simone; Lapa, Daniele; Lepore, Luciana; Libertone, Raffaella; Lionetti, Raffaella; Liuzzi, Giuseppina; Loiacono, Laura; Lucia, Andrea; Lufrani, Franco; Macchione, Manuela; Maffongelli, Gaetano; Marani, Alessandra; Mariano, Andrea; Marini, Maria Cristina; Maritti, Micaela; Mastrobattista, Annelisa; Mastrorosa, Ilaria; Matusali, Giulia; Mazzotta, Valentina; Mencarini, Paola; Meschi, Silvia; Messina, Francesco; Micarelli, Sibiana; Mogavero, Giulia; Mondi, Annalisa; Montalbano, Marzia; Montaldo, Chiara; Mosti, Silvia; Murachelli, Silvia; Musso, Maria; Nardi, Michela; Navarra, Assunta; Nocioni, Martina; Noto, Pasquale; Noto, Roberto; Oliva, Alessandra; Onnis, Ilaria; Ottou, Sandrine; Palazzolo, Claudia; Pallini, Emanuele; Palombi, Giulio; Pareo, Carlo; Passeri, Virgilio; Pelliccioni, Federico; Penna, Giovanna; Petrecchia, Antonella; Petrone, Ada; Pisciotta, Maria; Piselli, Pierluca; Pittalis, Silvia; Pontarelli, Agostina; Proietti, Costanza; Puro, Vincenzo; Ramazzini, Paolo Migliorisi; Rianda, Alessia; Rinonapoli, Gabriele; Rosati, Silvia; Rubino, Dorotea; Rueca, Martina; Ruggeri, Alberto; Sacchi, Alessandra; Sampaolesi, Alessandro; Sanasi, Francesco; Santagata, Carmen; Scarabello, Alessandra; Scarcia, Silvana; Scognamiglio, Paola; Scorzolini, Laura; Stazi, Giulia; Strano, Giacomo; Taglietti, Fabrizio; Taibi, Chiara; Taloni, Giorgia; Nardi, Tetaj; Tonnarini, Roberto; Topino, Simone; Tozzi, Martina; Vairo, Francesco; Valli, Maria Beatrice; Vergori, Alessandra; Vincenzi, Laura; Visco-Comandini, Ubaldo; Vita, Serena; Vittozzi, Pietro; Zaccarelli, Mauro; Zanetti, Antonella; Zito, Sara",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221004446?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34023492/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221004446; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.05.042,735
653057,Green infrastructure can limit but not solve air pollution injustice,2021-08-03,"The use of digital technologies in the agro-food sector is growing worldwide, and applications in the urban and regional food systems represent a relevant segment of such growth. The present paper aims at reviewing the literature on which and how digital technologies support urban and regional agro-food purchasing and consumption, as well as their characteristics. Data collection was performed on Scopus and Web of Science. Articles were selected using a research string and according to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow approach was adopted to explain data screening and selection. The 57 resulting studies were included in the final qualitative analysis, which explored the characteristics of the research studies and of the digital technologies analysed. Most of the studies analysed concerned the implications of digital technologies on local food consumption, especially focusing on consumption, primary production and hotel-restaurant-café-catering sector (HORECA), and to a limited extent on the retail sector. Consumers and farmers are the main targets of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) tools, whose principal aims are providing information on agro-food products and enhancing networking along the food supply chain. Analysing digital technologies allows a better understanding of their most popular features in order to support their spread among citizens. Digital technologies, and particularly Apps, can be a valuable instrument to strengthen agro-food chain actor relations and to promote urban and regional food systems.","Samoggia, Antonella; Monticone, Francesca; Bertazzoli, Aldo",Foods,https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10020208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33498393/,735

Due to its excellent biocompatibility (in vitro and in vivo), high water-holding capacity, flexibility, high mechanical properties, and a large number of hydroxyl groups that are most similar characteristics of native tissues, BNC has shown great potential in tissue engineering applications. This review focuses on and discusses the efficacy of BNC- or BNC-based biomaterials for hard tissue regeneration. In this review, we provide brief information on the key aspects of synthesis and properties of BNC, including solubility, biodegradability, thermal stability, antimicrobial ability, toxicity, and cellular response. Further, modification approaches are discussed briefly to improve the properties of BNC or BNC-based structures. In addition, various biomaterials by using BNC (as sacrificial template or matrix) or BNC in conjugation with polymers and/or fillers are reviewed and discussed for dental and bone tissue engineering applications. Moreover, the conclusion with perspective for future research directions of using BNC for hard tissue regeneration is briefly discussed.","Kumar, Anuj; Han, Sung-Soo",Materials (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ma14174777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34500866/,735
