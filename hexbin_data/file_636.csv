10655,Handoff Communication between Remote Healthcare Facilities,2020-03-20,"INTRODUCTION: In many centers, children with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) receive care either in an endocrinology ward or a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). We conducted a quality improvement (QI) initiative to reduce potentially avoidable PICU admissions of children with DKA without increasing endocrinology ward-to-PICU transfers. METHODS: A survey of providers demonstrated opportunities to increase awareness of institutional criteria for PICU admissions of children with DKA. We created an electronic health record (EHR) dot-phrase, prepopulated with these criteria, and placed a note in the EHR for all patients with DKA as a reference for all providers. An EHR-based data report was created to monitor the disposition of DKA patients and the use of the dot-phrase (process measure). The primary outcome measure was the potentially avoidable PICU admissions for patients with DKA. Endocrinology ward-to-PICU transfers were tracked as a balancing measure to ensure safe disposition. RESULTS: After the implementation of the dot-phrase, use was variable, but averaged 33.4% over 1 year. The percentage of DKA admissions classified as potentially avoidable PICU stays decreased from 4.1% to 0.5%, with a concurrent decrease in the total percentage of PICU admissions for DKA from 19.1% to 8.4%. The percentage of endocrinology ward-to-PICU transfers also declined from 0.8% to 0%. CONCLUSIONS: A novel EHR-based intervention increasing awareness and documentation of established pediatric DKA management guidelines can be used to safely reduce PICU admissions for DKA without increasing the rate of endocrinology ward-to-intensive care unit transfers.","Kaushal, Tara; Lord, Katherine; Olsen, Robert; Mehta, Sanjiv; Clark, Stephanie; Laskin, Benjamin; Traynor, Danielle; Taylor, April; Shaw, Kathy N.; Srinivasan, Vijay",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190258/,636

We present pooled week 148 analysis results from both studies. SETTING: SWORD-1: 65 centers, 13 countries; SWORD-2: 60 centers, 11 countries. METHODS: SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 are identical, open-label, phase III studies. Participants with screening HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for ≥6 months; no prior virologic failure; and no documented resistance-associated major protease inhibitor, integrase inhibitor, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), or non-NRTI mutations or integrase resistance-associated substitution R263K were randomly assigned 1:1 to switch to once-daily dolutegravir 50 mg plus rilpivirine 25 mg on day 1 (early-switch group) or to continue their current antiretroviral regimen and, if virologically suppressed at week 48, switch to dolutegravir plus rilpivirine at week 52 (late-switch group) until week 148. RESULTS: Using snapshot algorithm at week 148, 432 of 513 (84%) early-switch participants (148 weeks of exposure) and 428 of 477 (90%) late-switch participants (96 weeks of exposure) maintained HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL. Eleven participants (1%) on dolutegravir plus rilpivirine met the confirmed virologic withdrawal criterion through week 148 (early-switch group, n = 8; late-switch group, n = 3) with no integrase resistance identified. Non-NRTI resistance-associated mutations were identified in 6 participants (<1%). Drug-related adverse events (grades 2–4) were observed in 31 (6%) early-switch and 16 (3%) late-switch participants. Significant improvements in bone biomarkers were observed. Significant improvements were observed in renal biomarkers in participants taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate pre‐switch. CONCLUSION: Switching to the 2-drug regimen dolutegravir plus rilpivirine maintained virologic suppression for a high proportion of participants through 3 years, with low rates of virologic failure and a well-tolerated safety profile.","van Wyk, Jean; Orkin, Chloe; Rubio, Rafael; Bogner, Johannes; Baker, David; Khuong-Josses, Marie-Aude; Parks, David; Angelis, Konstantinos; Kahl, Lesley P.; Matthews, Jessica; Wang, Ruolan; Underwood, Mark; Wynne, Brian; Nascimento, Maria-Claudia; Vandermeulen, Kati; Gartland, Martin; Smith, Kimberly Y.",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7446981/,636
13451,The Emerging Role of Community Pharmacists in Remote Patient Monitoring Services,2020-09-06,"The cyclooxygenase-2 receptor is a therapeutic target for planning potential drugs with anti-inflammatory activity. The selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor rofecoxib was selected as a pivot molecule to perform virtual ligand-based screening from six commercial databases. We performed the search for similarly shaped Rapid Overlay of Chemical Structures (ROCS) and electrostatic (EON) compounds. After, we used pharmacokinetic and toxicological parameters to determine the best potential compounds, obtained through the softwares QikProp and Derek, respectively. Then, the compounds proceeded to the molecular anchorage study, which showed promising results of binding affinity with the hCOX-2 receptor: LMQC72 (∆G = −11.0 kcal/mol), LMQC36 (∆G = −10.6 kcal/mol), and LMQC50 (∆G = −10.2 kcal/mol). LMQC72 and LMQC36 showed higher binding affinity compared to rofecoxib (∆G = −10.4 kcal/mol). Finally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to evaluate the interaction of the compounds with the target hCOX-2 during 150 ns. In all MD simulation trajectories, the ligands remained interacting with the protein until the end of the simulation. The compounds were also complexing with hCOX-2 favorably. The compounds obtained the following affinity energy values: rofecoxib: ΔGbind = −45.31 kcal/mol; LMQC72: ΔGbind = −38.58 kcal/mol; LMQC36: ΔGbind = −36.10 kcal/mol; and LMQC50: ΔGbind = −39.40 kcal/mol. The selected LMQC72, LMQC50, and LMQC36 structures showed satisfactory pharmacokinetic results related to absorption and distribution. The toxicological predictions of these compounds did not display alerts for possible toxic groups and lower risk of cardiotoxicity compared to rofecoxib. Therefore, future in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to confirm the anti-inflammatory potential of the compounds selected here with bioinformatics approaches based on rofecoxib ligand.","Leão, Rozires P.; Cruz, Josiane V.; da Costa, Glauber V.; Cruz, Jorddy N.; Ferreira, Elenilze F.

14430,"Trialstreamer: A living, automatically updated database of clinical trial reports",2020-09-17,"Native intact N-glycopeptide analysis can provide access to the comprehensive characteristics of N-glycan occupancy, including N-glycosites, N-glycan compositions, and N-glycoproteins for complex samples. The sample pre-processing method used for the analysis of intact N-glycopeptides usually depends on the enrichment of low abundance N-glycopeptides from a tryptic peptide mixture using hydrophilic substances before LC-MS/MS detection. However, the number of identified intact N-glycopeptides remains inadequate to achieve an in-depth profile of the N-glycosylation landscape. Here, we optimized the sample preparation workflow prior to LC-MS/MS analysis by systematically comparing different analytical methods, including the use of different sources of trypsin, combinations of different proteases, and different enrichment materials. Finally, we found that the combination of Trypsin (B)/Lys-C digestion and zwitterionic HILIC (Zic-HILIC) enrichment significantly improved the mass spectrometric characterization of intact N-glycopeptides, increasing the number of identified intact N-glycopeptides and offering better analytical reproducibility. Furthermore, the optimized workflow was applied to the analysis of intact N-glycopeptides in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)-cultured breast cancer cells in vitro and xenografted tumors in mice. These results indicated that the same breast cancer cells, when cultured in different microenvironments, can show different N-glycosylation patterns. This study also provides an interesting comparison of the N-glycoproteome of breast cancer cells cultured in different growth conditions, indicating the important role of N-glycosylated proteins in cancer cell growth and the choice of the cell culture model for studies in tumor biology and drug evaluation.","Mao, Yonghong; Zhao, Yang; Zhang, Yong; Yang, Hao",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7728280/,636
15658,Trends in Vitamin C Consumption in the United States: 1999–2018,2021-01-28,"Pneumonia and inflammatory diseases of the pulmonary system such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality globally. While the etiology of these diseases is highly different, they share a number of similarities in the underlying inflammatory processes driving disease pathology. Multiple recent studies have identified failures in efferocytosis—the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells—as a common driver of inflammation and tissue destruction in these diseases. Effective efferocytosis has been shown to be important for resolving inflammatory diseases of the lung and the subsequent restoration of normal lung function, while many pneumonia-causing pathogens manipulate the efferocytic system to enhance their growth and avoid immunity. Moreover, some treatments used to manage these patients, such as inhaled corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the prevalent use of statins for cardiovascular disease, have been found to beneficially alter efferocytic activity in these patients. In this review, we provide an overview of the efferocytic process and its role in the pathophysiology and resolution of pneumonia and other inflammatory diseases of the lungs, and discuss the utility of existing and emerging therapies for modulating efferocytosis as potential treatments for these diseases.","Zheng, David Jiao; Abou Taka, Maria; Heit, Bryan",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7912081/,636
16552,Can technology increase COVID-19 vaccination rates?,2021-04-01,"The expansion of mosquito species worldwide is creating a powerful network for the spread of arboviruses. In addition to the destruction of breeding sites (prevention) and mass trapping, methods based on the sterile insect technique (SIT), the autodissemination of pyriproxyfen (ADT), and a fusion of elements from both of these known as boosted SIT (BSIT), are being developed to meet the urgent need for effective vector control. However, the comparative potential of these methods has yet to be explored in different environments. This is needed to propose and integrate informed guidelines into sustainable mosquito management plans. We extended a weather-dependent model of Aedes albopictus population dynamics to assess the effectiveness of these different vector control methods, alone or in combination, in a tropical (Reunion island, southwest Indian Ocean) and a temperate (Montpellier area, southern France) climate. Our results confirm the potential efficiency of SIT in temperate climates when performed early in the year (mid-March for northern hemisphere). In such a climate, the timing of the vector control action was the key factor in its success. In tropical climates, the potential of the combination of methods becomes more relevant. BSIT and the combination of ADT with SIT were twice as effective compared to the use of SIT alone.","Douchet, Léa; Haramboure, Marion; Baldet, Thierry; L’Ambert, Gregory; Damiens, David; Gouagna, Louis Clément; Bouyer, Jeremy; Labbé, Pierrick; Tran, Annelise",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8016901/,636

19337,Exploring the Enjoyment of the Intergenerational Physical Activity,2021-06-14,"The community pharmacy has a number of attributes that makes it an excellent setting for research and development projects, as it is a highly accessible part of the healthcare system and is staffed by highly trained health care professionals. The big turnover in patients in the community pharmacy makes it possible to reach a great number of patients and collect a lot of data in a relatively short time. However, conducting nation-wide research and development projects can be a rather time-consuming process for the individual community pharmacy, and can thus require collaboration with other community pharmacies and researchers. This will help ensure strong results and better implementation. Thus, the Danish Network for Community Pharmacy Practice for Research and Development (NUAP) was established in Denmark by a number of highly committed community pharmacies and researchers. NUAP consists of 102 member pharmacy owners in addition to a number of researchers. The aim of the network is to strengthen pharmacy practice and pharmacy practice research in Denmark by providing a forum where community pharmacy practitioners and researchers meet and work together. The network is led by a steering committee elected by the members in the network.","Burghle, Alaa; Hansen, Rikke Nørgaard; Nørgaard, Lotte Stig; Hedegaard, Ulla; Bendixen, Susanne; Søndergaard, Lone; Servilieri, Kerly; Hansen, Julianne; Rossing, Charlotte",Pharmacy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8293441/,636

33275,Serious cardiac AEs with hydroxychloroquine during COVID-19 pandemic,2020-05-30,"In this paper, we discuss parameterized algorithms for variants of the partial vertex cover problem. Recall that in the classical vertex cover problem (VC), we are given a graph [Formula: see text] and a number K and asked if we can cover all of the edges in E, using at most K vertices from V. In the partial vertex cover problem (PVC), in addition to the parameter K, we are given a second parameter [Formula: see text] and the question is whether we can cover at least [Formula: see text] of the edges in E using at most K vertices from V. The weighted generalizations of the VC and PVC problems are called the weighted vertex cover (WVC) and the partial weighted vertex cover problem (WPVC) respectively. In the WPVC problem, we are given two parameters R and L, associated respectively with the vertex set V and edge set E of the graph [Formula: see text]. Additionally, we are given non-negative integral weight functions for the vertices and the edges. The goal then is to cover edges of total weight at least L, using vertices of total weight at most R. (In the WVC problem, the goal is to cover all the edges with vertices whose total weight is at most R). This paper studies several variants of the PVC problem and establishes new results from the perspective of fixed-parameter tractability and W[1]-hardness. We also introduce a new problem called the partial vertex cover with matching constraint and show that it is fixed-parameter tractable for a certain class of graphs.","Mkrtchyan, Vahan; Petrosyan, Garik; Subramani, K.; Wojciechowski, Piotr",Combinatorial Algorithms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7254907/,636

We implemented subsumption demodulation in the theorem prover Vampire, by extending Vampire with a new clause index and adapting its multi-literal matching component.

Furthermore, we examine the critical factors for explaining why the different organizations in the ecosystem cooperate. We find that associations and knowledge agents play the most relevant roles. Conversely, local and non-local governments rarely played brokerage roles to coordinate or inter-connect isolated operations of individual organizations. Finally, our results suggest important guidelines for practitioners that may facilitate the collaboration, coordination, and performance of a response network in the future.","Belso-Martínez, José Antonio; Mas-Tur, Alicia; Sánchez, Mariola; López-Sánchez, María José",Serv Bus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7371827/,636

38495,In a Pandemic Are We More Religious? Traditional Practices of Catholics and the COVID-19 in Southwestern Colombia,2020-08-31,"The same term “dose-response curve” describes the relationship between the number of ingested microbes or their logarithm, and the probability of acute illness or death (type I), and between a disinfectant’s dose and the targeted microbe’s survival ratio (type II), akin to survival curves in thermal and non-thermal inactivation kinetics. The most common model of type I curves is the cumulative form of the beta-Poisson distribution which is sometimes indistinguishable from the lognormal or Weibull distribution. The most notable survival kinetics models in static disinfection are of the Chick-Watson-Hom’s kind. Their published dynamic versions, however, should be viewed with caution. A microbe population’s type II dose-response curve, static and dynamic, can be viewed as expressing an underlying spectrum of individual vulnerabilities (or resistances) to the particular disinfectant. Therefore, such a curve can be described mathematically by the flexible Weibull distribution, whose scale parameter is a function of the disinfectant’s intensity, temperature, and other factors. But where the survival ratio’s drop is so steep that the static dose-response curve resembles a step function, the Fermi distribution function becomes a suitable substitute. The utility of the CT (or Ct) concept primarily used in water disinfection is challenged on theoretical grounds and its limitations highlighted. It is suggested that stochastic models of microbial inactivation could be used to link the fates of individual viruses or bacteria to their manifestation in the survival curve’s shape. Although the emphasis is on viruses and bacteria, most of the discussion is relevant to fungi, protozoa, and perhaps worms too.","Peleg, Micha",Food Eng Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7453085/,636

As a response, there have been several treatment recommendations published by international, federal, state, and local governing bodies. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive review of COVID-19 policies and aggregated multi-disciplinary expertise at our quaternary care academic facility to formulate objective criteria for scheduling surgery, providing neurosurgical coverage, and engaging in neurosurgical research during the COVID-19 outbreak. Recommendations from the CDC, WHO, California State Department of Public Health (CDPH), San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), and the UCSF School of Medicine were collected and reviewed by the expert panel. Treatment algorithms regarding the following issues were drafted: (1) neurosurgical case scheduling, (2) neurosurgical clinic scheduling, (3) contingency plans for neurosurgical staffing and ICU utilization, and (4) staffing neurosurgical research directives. RESULTS: Here, we present a neurosurgical treatment algorithm for varying levels of COVID-19 community infection. This algorithm (with an accompanying checklist) is centered around a three-tiered system of viral ‘surge’ quantification, which we use to triage case scheduling, and a paired coverage model for inpatient services. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 represents a challenge to ongoing practice, however with clear algorithms, checklists, and contingency planning, it is possible to provide focused neurosurgical care during this pandemic.","Burke, John F; Chan, Andrew K.H; Mummaneni, Valli; Chou, Dean; Lobo, Errol; Berger, Mitchel S; Theodosopoulos, Philip V; Mummaneni, Praveen V",Neurosurgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7717392/,636

Compared with the CON group, 0.2% M feed in the diet increased the average daily gain (ADG) on days 15–35 and day 1–35 and the average daily feed intake on days 1–35 (ADFI) (0.05 < P < 0.1). Besides, higher villus height of the duodenum and jejunum and lower crypt depth of duodenum and colon were revealed in the 0.2% M group than in the CON group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the V/C (ratio of the villus height and crypt depth) in the 0.2% M group was increased compared to that in the CON group both from the duodenum and ileum (P < 0.05). The relative mRNA expression of mucin-1, ITGB1 (β1-integrins), and PKC (protein kinase C) of ileum in the 0.2% M group were upregulated (P < 0.05) compared to that in the CON group. The digesta sample of ileum from piglets in the 0.2% M group contained greater (P < 0.05) intestinal bacterial diversity and abundances of probiotics, such as Streptococcus, Eubacterium_rectale_group, and Lactobacillus, which could promote the synthesis of carbon-containing biomolecules. Overall, dietary supplementation of 0.2% M was shown to have a tendency to improve the growth performance of weaned piglets and may enhance their intestinal mucosal barrier function via altering the gut microbiota.","Liu, Han; Wang, Congmin; Gu, Xueling; Zhao, Jing; Nie, Cunxi; Zhang, Wenju; Ma, Xi",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7723851/,636

Ternary compositions are promising for further improvement in their performance. The stability of the composition during coating formation is an important issue for blended feedstock powders in order to obtain the desired properties. This work focuses on the compositional changes of a ternary blend of Al(2)O(3), Cr(2)O(3) and TiO(x) powders of equal content by mass in a conventional atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) process using an Ar/H(2) plasma gas mixture. By increasing the argon flow rate at constant hydrogen flow rate, the total plasma gas flow rate and the Ar/H(2) ratio were varied. For the highest argon flow rate, this resulted in an average particle velocity of 140% and an average particle temperature of 90% of the initial values, respectively. Coating composition and microstructure were studied by optical microscopy, SEM, including EDS analyses, and XRD. In addition, the coating hardness and electrical impedance were also measured. Differences in the “difficulty of melting factor” (DMF) and the thermal diffusivity of the three oxides appear to be responsible for the dramatic change of the coating composition with an increasing argon flow rate. For the highest argon flow rate applied, besides TiO(2), the coating contains only 8 wt.% Al(2)O(3), while the Cr(2)O(3) content remained almost constant. At the same time, the change of the Ar/H(2) ratio resulted in the formation of stoichiometric TiO(2) in the coating by oxidation of TiO(x) in the feedstock powder. Moreover, a small content of titanium was found in the Cr(2)O(3) splats, showing that there are only limited interactions between the large oxide powder particles. Thus, the study has shown that stability of the chemical composition during spraying of ternary powder blends is strongly influenced by the process conditions.","Grimm, Maximilian; Conze, Susan; Berger, Lutz-Michael; Paczkowski, Gerd; Drehmann, Rico; Lampke, Thomas",J Therm Spray Tech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7744087/,636

However, the potential targets and molecular mechanisms of VK2 for salt-sensitive hypertension have not been fully investigated. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms of VK2 for salt-sensitive hypertension using network pharmacology and 16S rRNA sequencing strategy. The network pharmacology-based findings from KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that VK2-treated salt-sensitive hypertension was mechanically associated with the complement and coagulation cascades, calcium signaling pathway, renin–angiotensin system, etc. A total of 29 different bacteria in an animal experiment after VK2 supplementation were screened and functionally enriched using PICRUSt2. Additionally, 10 signaling pathways were identified in which the renin–angiotensin system was found to be the potential molecular mechanisms with the greatest change in multiple and statistical significance. Moreover, the results of the renin–angiotensin system-related protein expression exhibited VK2-inhibited renin–angiotensin system in salt-induced hypertensive mice, which significantly verified the previous biological and functional prediction analysis. Finally, spearman correlation analysis showed the different bacteria such as Dubosiella, Ileibacterium, etc., had a positive or negative correlation with renin–angiotensin system-related proteins in salt-induced mice. In conclusion, the potential molecular mechanisms of VK2 for salt-sensitive hypertension may be beneficially achieved by the specific inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system, contributing to the development for a new preventive strategy of salt-sensitive hypertension.","Liu, Tian-hao; Chen, Ming-hao; Tu, Wan-qing; Liang, Qiu-er; Tao, Wen-cong; Jin, Zhen; Xiao, Ya; Chen, Li-guo",Front Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7943625/,636

49986,COVID-19 Pandemic: An Unprecedented Blessing for Nature,2021-03-23,"Agricultural sources and non-agricultural emissions contribute to gaseous ammonia (NH(3)) that plays a vital role in severe haze formation. Qualitative and quantitative contributions of these sources to ambient PM(2.5) (particulate matter with an aerodynamic equivalent diameter below 2.5 µm) concentrations remains uncertain. Stable nitrogen isotopic composition (δ(15)N) of NH(3) and NH(4)(+) (δ(15)N(NH(3)) and δ(15)N(NH(4)(+)), respectively) can yield valuable information about its sources and associated processes. This review provides an overview of the recent progress in analytical techniques for δ(15)N(NH(3)) and δ(15)N(NH(4)(+)) measurement, sampling of atmospheric NH(3) and NH(4)(+) in the ambient air and their sources signature (e.g., agricultural vs. fossil fuel), and isotope-based source apportionment of NH(3) in urban atmosphere. This study highlights that collecting sample that are fully representative of emission sources remains a challenge in fingerprinting δ(15)N(NH(3)) values of NH(3) emission sources. Furthermore, isotopic fractionation during NH(3) gas-to-particle conversion under varying ambient field conditions (e.g., relative humidity, particle pH, temperature) remains unclear, which indicates more field and laboratory studies to validate theoretically predicted isotopic fractionation are required. Thus, this study concludes that lack of refined δ(15)N(NH(3)) fingerprints and full understanding of isotopic fractionation during aerosol formation in a laboratory and field conditions is a limitation for isotope-based source apportionment of NH(3). More experimental work (in chamber studies) and theoretical estimations in combinations of field verification are necessary in characterizing isotopic fractionation under various environmental and atmospheric neutralization conditions, which would help to better interpret isotopic data and our understanding on NH(x) (NH(3) + NH(4)(+)) dynamics in the atmosphere.

49987,COVID-19 and Its Impact on Carbon Dioxide Emissions,2021-03-23,"At the end of the twentieth century, two historical turns of economic inequality happened. Among the developed countries of the Global North, the secular trend of decreasing intra-national inequality turned into its opposite. At about the same time, the long period of global inequality began to bend down, among households as well as among nations, a turn less noticed but more significant than the reduction of extreme poverty in the South. The foundation of the former turn was the beginning of de-industrialization in the North, and the coming of a post-industrial society, very different from the one predicted. The paper analyzes the trigger of the turn and the central dynamics of the new inequality in the rich North, financialization, and the digital revolution. It then tries to answer two questions about the global turn: Was the decline of global inequality causally connected to the increase of Northern intra-national inequality? Will there be a development of industrial societies in the South? The answer to both is no. What lies ahead is more likely a global convergence of intra-national unequalization, albeit with both different and similar dynamics, as the decline of extreme poverty in the South is leading to inequality increases comparable to those of the North. Post-industrialism has no egalitarian dialectic like that of industrial capitalism, but the dynamics of the twenty-first century inequality are likely to be confronted not only with popular protest movements but also with an emergent scholarly and intellectual Egalitarian Enlightenment.","Therborn, Göran",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7982336/,636

However, nowadays serverless computing offers a new way of developing and deploying cloud-native applications. Serverless computing also called NoOps, offloads management and server configuration (operations work) from the user to the cloud provider and lets the user focus only on the product developments. Hence, there are debates regarding which deployment strategy to use. This research provides a performance comparison of a cloud-native web application along with three different function benchmarks in terms of scalability, reliability, and latency when deployed using DevOps and NoOps deployment strategy. NoOps deployment in this work is achieved using Google Cloud Function and OpenWhisk, while DevOps is achieved using the Kubernetes engine. This research shows that neither of the deployment strategies fits all the scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that each type of deployment strategy has its advantages under different scenarios. The DevOps deployment strategy has a huge performance advantage (almost 72% lesser 90 percentile response time) for simple web-based requests and requests accessing databases while compute-intensive applications perform better with NoOps deployment. Additionally, NoOps deployment provides better scaling-agility as compared to DevOps.","Jindal, Anshul; Gerndt, Michael",Cloud Computing and Services Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7982688/,636

The purpose of this paper is to clarify the meaning of the knowledge economy by conducting a critical review of the precursors of the knowledge economy and their major critiques so as to identify the current research implications. We aim to identify common ground in advancing the research of the knowledge economy. In essence, our understanding of the knowledge economy is viewed from a ‘new’ social-economic-theoretical perspective in which the theoretical foundation focuses on the explosion of technology that motivates people to be innovative and possess knowledge in producing knowledge products or be so engrossed with sociability using technology at home. Our finding is that the notion of the knowledge economy must be viewed from some phenomena that have transformed the contemporary economy. Other major findings include the following: (1) we use the term knowledge economy instead of the multiplicity of terms to describe this new form of economy; (2) we articulate that the theoretical foundation of the knowledge economy is a branch of social economy where the economy is not based solely on production and consumption but is based more on social values, technology, knowledge and innovation to commercialize knowledge products; and (3) the statistical assessment methodology is delivered through the use of indicators to proxy for the four knowledge economy criteria that makes up the knowledge economy. This has the following implications for economic management, knowledge-induced innovation, computerization of the economy, and knowledge management in the new economy.","Choong, Kwee Keong; Leung, Patrick W.",J Knowl Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7995391/,636

51500,Motherhood and COVID-19: a Digital Psychoeducational Booklet for the Coping with the Pandemic Stressors,2021-04-13,"The world is experiencing a rapid loss in the biodiversity of pollinator insects. Habitat segmentation caused by infrastructures is one of the contributing factors. To improve the habitat connectivity of pollinator insects, it is proposed in this study to build green corridors for pollinators over linear infrastructures such as highways. In the context of suburban areas of a large city, this study examines differences in air parameters between natural environments and a roadside environment based on monitored and estimated data. Influences of different green corridor designs on floral scent dispersion are also investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling and simulation. It is found that, if flower plants are installed on highway overpasses, the floral scents would be better preserved as compared with those in a natural environment due to the lower concentrations of oxidative radicals in the air above highways. The stronger floral scents and their wider dispersion may help attract pollinators. Conversely, highway air contains a variety of volatine organic compounds (VOCs) that are traced to highway operations and pavements. Hence, the overall profile of VOCs in a highway environment differs from that in a natural environment. Results from CFD modeling and simulation suggest that the use of green corridors planted with flowers on the highway overpass can greatly improve the connectivity of floral scents. Hence, with proper engineering design and right combination of plant species, green corridors built on highway overpasses have the potential to facilitate pollinators to cross the road, thereby improving their habitat connectivity and resilience against declining biodiversity.","Wang, Yuhong; Jia, Siqi; Wang, Zhe; Chen, Yang; Mo, Shicong; Sze, N.

Despite this high occurrence, information regarding sexual dysfunction as well as their correlates in patients receiving care for mental disorders in developing countries is still sparse. AIM: To determine the prevalence and correlates of sexual dysfunction among patients with mental disorders receiving care in a tertiary hospital in Southwest Nigeria. SETTING: This study was performed at the psychiatric outpatient clinic at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Southwest Nigeria. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a convenience sample of 238 adults aged 18–60 years. Socio-demographic and clinical information was obtained from all recruited patients. Sexual dysfunction was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire for men and the Female Sexual Function Index questionnaire for women. Questionnaires for measuring depression, medication adherence and autonomic medication side effects were also administered. Associations between sexual dysfunction and socio-demographic and clinical factors were explored. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of sexual dysfunction among male and female participants were 84.7% and 95.7%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, employment status and autonomic side effects of psychotropic medications significantly predicted male sexual dysfunction, while religion and employment status were predictors of female sexual dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Sexual dysfunction is very common among patients with mental disorders, with higher rates in female participants. There is a need for clinicians to consider routine screening for sexual dysfunction in psychiatric outpatients with a view of providing psychosocial interventions to improve patient’s quality of life.","Adesola, Adekunle O.; Oladeji, Bibilola",S Afr J Psychiatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182448/,636

Few local studies of HIV-related cardiac disease have confirmed this. Early identification of cardiac plaques would assist clinicians with risk stratification and implementation of treatment strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality. In resource-limited settings the use of conventional computed tomography (CT) may have a role in identifying at-risk individuals. OBJECTIVES: This hypothesis-generating study was aimed at determining the contribution of HIV to accelerated vascular aging by assessing cardiac calcifications, incidentally detected on conventional CT chest imaging, in a young HIV-positive population. METHOD: A retrospective quantitative analysis was performed at a tertiary hospital in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, over a 5-year period. Young patients (18–45 years) who underwent CT chest imaging for varied indications were included, further sub-categorised by immune status, the presence, absence and location of calcifications. Patients with unknown HIV statuses were excluded. RESULTS: An increased probability of cardiac calcification with increasing age, independent of the HIV status, was established. No statistically significant difference could be demonstrated between the cohorts. In the pre-contrasted subcategory, a lower P-value suggested an ‘imminent’ statistical significance. Contrast may have obscured some calcifications. The failure to record the immune status in a large number of patients resulted in their exclusion and limited the study. CONCLUSION: The increased prevalence of incidentally detected cardiac calcifications in young HIV-infected individuals warrants further evaluation and cardiovascular risk stratification.","Muller, Luize; Sewchuran, Tanusha; Durand, Miranda",South Afr J HIV Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182472/,636

Silver (Ag)-based antimicrobials are promising to combat antibiotic resistant S. aureus, yet their molecular targets are largely elusive. Herein, we separate and identify 38 authentic Ag(+)-binding proteins in S. aureus at the whole-cell scale. We then capture the molecular snapshot on the dynamic action of Ag(+) against S. aureus and further validate that Ag(+) could inhibit a key target 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase through binding to catalytic His185 by X-ray crystallography. Significantly, the multi-target mode of action of Ag(+) (and nanosilver) endows its sustainable antimicrobial efficacy, leading to enhanced efficacy of conventional antibiotics and resensitization of MRSA to antibiotics. Our study resolves the long-standing question of the molecular targets of silver in S. aureus and offers insights into the sustainable bacterial susceptibility of silver, providing a potential approach for combating antimicrobial resistance.","Wang, Haibo; Wang, Minji; Xu, Xiaohan; Gao, Peng; Xu, Zeling; Zhang, Qi; Li, Hongyan; Yan, Aixin; Kao, Richard Yi-Tsun; Sun, Hongzhe",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8184742/,636

Adult Learning as Self‐Care in COVID‐19,2021-05-29,"Nowadays, cities and towns all over the world are dotted with high-rise buildings, and floor positioning technology has gradually become the focus of indoor positioning research. Multi-level buildings with an atrium space structure mainly consist of shopping malls and hospital outpatient buildings. This kind of building is widely spread, and they usually have a lot of people and a high demand for location-based services. The specific spatial structure of the indoor atrium makes the propagation of wireless signals different, which leads to most of the wireless signal-based floor positioning methods not working well in such an environment. Aiming at this atrium structure environment, this paper proposes a high-precision multi-method adaptive weighted fusion algorithm based on Bluetooth Low Energy signals. In experiments, the real-time dynamic floor positioning accuracy reached 92.7%, while the floor positioning accuracy in the 5-s static state was as high as 100%. Besides, when using 3 s of test data rolled back, real-time effects could also be achieved, with an accuracy of 98.3%. This method can be used alone for real-time floor positioning, it is suitable for wireless fidelity signals, and it can provide a highly accurate initial floor reference for barometric or inertial methods. It could also be integrated with other methods to provide highly accurate floor locations for long periods of time. The fingerprint library acquisition in this method saves time and effort. The database volume is small and generalizable to a wide range of applications.","Qi, Hongxia; Wang, Yunjia; Bi, Jingxue; Cao, Hongji; Xu, Shenglei; Liu, Hui",Acta Geod Geophys,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8196286/,636

Ferric enterobactin protein (FepA) is a conserved protein of K. pneumoniae with high immunogenicity. In the present study, using comprehensive in silico approaches the T and B cell-specific epitopes of K. pneumoniae FepA were identified. The T (both class I and class II) and B (both linear and conformational) epitopes of FepA were predicted using prediction tools. The predicted epitopes were screened for human similarity, immunogenicity, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, conservancy, structural and physicochemical suitability, and in case of T epitopes binding to HLA alleles, using numerous immune-informatics, homology modeling, and molecular docking approaches. These analyses led to introduce the most dominant FepA epitopes that are appropriate for vaccine development. Furthermore, we introduced an antigenic peptide containing both T and B epitopes which comprises suitable structural and physiochemical properties needed for vaccine development and it is conserved in many bacteria. Altogether, here the highly immunogenic T and B epitopes of FepA as well as a final epitopic peptide containing both T and B epitopes were found and introduced for future vaccine development studies.

The traditional airfare price prediction system is limited by the nonlinear interrelationship of multiple factors and fails to deal with the impact of different time steps, resulting in low prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel civil airline fare prediction system with a Multi-Attribute Dual-stage Attention (MADA) mechanism integrating different types of data extracted from the same dimension. In this method, the Seq2Seq model is used to add attention mechanisms to both the encoder and the decoder. The encoder attention mechanism extracts multi-attribute data from time series, which are optimized and filtered by the temporal attention mechanism in the decoder to capture the complex time dependence of the ticket price sequence. Extensive experiments with actual civil aviation data sets were performed, and the results suggested that MADA outperforms airfare prediction models based on the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), random forest, or deep learning models in MSE, RMSE, and MAE indicators. And from the results of a large amount of experimental data, it is proven that the prediction results of the MADA model proposed in this paper on different routes are at least 2.3% better than the other compared models.","Zhao, Zhichao; You, Jinguo; Gan, Guoyu; Li, Xiaowu; Ding, Jiaman",Appl Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8331096/,636

Ideally, to enable effective assessment and interventions for social isolation, an issue inherent to depressive and psychotic illnesses, the isolation must be identified in real-time and at an individual level. However, research addressing sociability deficits is largely focused on determining loneliness, rather than isolation, and lacks focus on the richness of the social environment the individual revolves in. In this paper, We describe the development of an automated, objective and privacy-preserving Social Ambiance Measure (SAM) that converts unconstrained audio recordings collected from wrist-worn audio-bands into four levels, ranging from none to active. The ambiance levels are based on the number of simultaneous speakers, which is a proxy for overall social activity in the environment. Results show that social ambiance patterns and time spent at each ambiance level differed between participants with depressive or psychotic disorders and healthy controls. Individuals with depression/psychosis spent less time in diverse environments and less time in moderate/active ambiance levels. Moreover, social ambiance patterns are found associated with the severity of self-reported depression, anxiety symptoms and personality traits. The results in this paper suggest that objectively measured social ambiance can be used as a marker of sociability, and holds potential to be leveraged to better understand social isolation and develop effective interventions for sociability challenges, thus improving mental health outcomes.","Chen, Wenwan; Sabharwal, Ashutosh; Taylor, Erica; Patel, Ankit B.; Moukaddam, Nidal",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8385275/,636

It has been previously demonstrated that conditions such as tracheal stenosis, asthma and even lung transplantation may worsen with reflux and these patients have few symptoms of GERD. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of people who needed mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy increased. Our objective was to demonstrate the prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux in patients with tracheostomy and describe its characteristics. METHODS: Esophageal manometry and 24 h pH-metry was performed in 137 consecutive patients with a tracheostomy already in a chronic phase, independent of symptoms. Inquire on respiratory and digestive symptoms was also carried out at the time of the examination. Prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux was identified in this population and description of the groups with reflux and without it, as well as comparison between them. RESULTS: Of the 137 patients, 49 were male, the average age was 40.94 ± 17.3 and the body mass index was 26.3 ± 4.85. The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux was 45.2%. Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups with and without reflux. In the reflux group, the mean DeMeester score was 36.5 ± 20.8 and the presence of lower sphincter hypotonia was found in only 31% of the patients and was not correlated with reflux between the groups (p = 0.285). Regarding the symptoms, 48% had heartburn symptoms and only 30% had a combination of typical symptoms (heartburn + regurgitation). CONCLUSION: The presence of tracheostomy is related to an increased prevalence of reflux, even without typical symptoms most of the time. The mechanism for this is still unknown, perhaps the altered respiratory dynamics has a role. These patients should be investigated with functional exams if they develop any condition that may be affected by reflux.","Bianchi, Edno Tales; Tustumi, Francisco; Szachnowicz, Sergio; Nasi, Ary; Lopes, Leticia Nobre; Duarte, Andre Fonseca; Seguro, Francisco Carlos Bernal Costa; Cardoso, Paulo Francisco Guerreiro; Sallum, Rubens Antonio Aissar; Cecconello, Ivan; Nahas, Sergio Carlos",Dis Esophagus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8499990/,636

This paper briefly surveys and assesses the main narratives that attempt to explain the causes of this discontent in the region. The results show that discontent has different roots, which are mostly explained from an individual point of view rather than from a contextual one. Inequality of opportunity and institutional weaknesses play the main role. Considering the COVID-19 social and economic crisis, our results shed light on the key elements to address whether discontent is to be contained.","Segovia, Joselin; Pontarollo, Nicola; Orellana, Mercy",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8500101/,636

A single institution experience.,2021-05-10,"BACKGROUND/AIM The aim of this study is to present our experience on various endovascular treatment modalities of basilar fenestration aneurysms and to review our findings along with the literature data. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 24 patients with 26 BAF aneurysms who have admitted to our clinics were endovascularly treated, and two centers were used for this purpose. All patients were evaluated with computed tomography (CT), CT angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angio graphy (DSA) before the procedure. RESULTS Whole aneurysms were successfully occluded with 100 per cent rate of technical success. Procedure-related complications were encountered in two patients. Our comprehensive literature research has revealed that most of the papers related with the topic were case reports. In the literature, it has been reported from 46 studies that 101 patients with 113 BAF aneurysms were endovascularly treated between years 1993 and 2019. The overall positive outcome, clinical success, and the complication rate values of the studies in the literature were 97, 91 and 8.8 percent, respectively, whereas these values were 100%, 92% and 7.6% in our study. CONCLUSIONS Despite the low number of cases in the current study, it is by far the most comprehensive series in the literature to date. Our results suggest that BAF aneurysms can be successfully and safely treated with different endovascular techniques, with the gradually increased use of stents in recent years.","Korkmaz, Mehmet; Çİnar, Celal; Nas, Ömer Fatİh; Hakyemez, Bahattİn; Oran, İsmaİl",Turkish journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-2006-352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33356025/,636

An Analysis of Issue Importance, Message Fatigue, and Reactance Regarding COVID-19 Messaging.",2021-05-03,"BACKGROUND Navigation systems have the potential to facilitate intraoperative orientation and recognition of anatomical structures. Intraoperative accuracy of navigation in thoracoabdominal surgery depends on soft tissue deformation. We evaluated esophageal motion caused by respiration and pneumoperitoneum in a porcine model for minimally invasive esophagectomy. METHODS In ten pigs (20-34 kg) under general anesthesia, gastroscopic hemoclips were applied to the cervical (CE), high (T1), middle (T2), and lower thoracic (T3) level, and to the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) of the esophagus. Furthermore, skin markers were applied. Three-dimensional (3D) and four-dimensional (4D) computed tomography (CT) scans were acquired before and after creation of pneumoperitoneum. Marker positions and lung volumes were analyzed with open source image segmentation software. RESULTS Respiratory motion of the esophagus was higher at T3 (7.0 ± 3.3 mm, mean ± SD) and GEJ (6.9 ± 2.8 mm) than on T2 (4.5 ± 1.8 mm), T1 (3.1 ± 1.8 mm), and CE (1.3 ± 1.1 mm). There was significant motion correlation in between the esophageal levels. T1 motion correlated with all other esophagus levels (r = 0.51, p = 0.003). Esophageal motion correlated with ventilation volume (419 ± 148 ml) on T1 (r = 0.29), T2 (r = 0.44), T3 (r = 0.54), and GEJ (r = 0.58) but not on CE (r = - 0.04). Motion correlation of the esophagus with skin markers was moderate to high for T1, T2, T3, GEJ, but not evident for CE. Pneumoperitoneum led to considerable displacement of the esophagus (8.2 ± 3.4 mm) and had a level-specific influence on respiratory motion. CONCLUSIONS The position and motion of the esophagus was considerably influenced by respiration and creation of pneumoperitoneum. Esophageal motion correlated with respiration and skin motion. Possible compensation mechanisms for soft tissue deformation were successfully identified. The porcine model is similar to humans for respiratory esophageal motion and can thus help to develop navigation systems with compensation for soft tissue deformation.","Nickel, Felix; Kenngott, Hannes G; Neuhaus, Jochen; Andrews, Nathanael; Garrow, Carly; Kast, Johannes; Sommer, Christof M; Gehrig, Tobias; Gutt, Carsten N; Meinzer, Hans-Peter; Müller-Stich, Beat P",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6168-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29603002/,636

Ischemic cerebrovascular disease can not only cause stroke, but is also associated with a high incidence of asymptomatic infarction and minimal bleeding that can lead to cognitive and behavioral changes. These changes ultimately manifest as vascular dementia or cognitive impairment. In clinical settings, ischemic cerebrovascular disease can be classified as a transient ischemic attack, reversible ischemic neurological deficit, progressive stroke, complete stroke, marginal infarction, or lacunar infarction. In this review, the research progress of imaging technologies for ischemic cerebrovascular diseases was reviewed, with an aim to provide evidence for clinical practitioners.","Chen, Li; Zhao, Ningning; Xu, Shan",The Journal of international medical research,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300060520972601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730890/,636

The crude drugs derived from animals investigated in this study were Cervi Parvum Cornu and Trogopterorum feces, which are derived from a mix of different animal species, two chopped cicada sloughs, and two commercial Kampo drugs. The mitochondrial 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene regions were amplified and sequenced using MiSeq. The ratios of haplotype to total number of sequences reads were calculated after sequence extraction and trimming. Haplotypes that exceeded the threshold were defined as positive haplotypes, which were compared with all available sequences using BLAST. In the Cervi Parvum Cornu and Trogopterorum feces samples, the haplotype ratios corresponded roughly to the mixture ratios, although there was a slight difference from mixture ratios depending on the gene examined. This method could also roughly estimate the compositions of chopped cicada sloughs and Kampo drugs. This analysis, whereby the sequences of several genes are elucidated, is better for identifying the included animal species. This method should be useful for quality control of crude drugs and Kampo drugs.","Nakanishi, Hiroaki; Yoneyama, Katsumi; Hara, Masaaki; Takada, Aya; Saito, Kazuyuki",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85803-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33739020/,636

Improvements in outcomes have been driven by multiple advances, including the use of non-invasive monitors to assess cardiovascular and respiratory status. More recent advances have included the development and use of monitors to measure neurologic status by means of ""processed"" electroencephalography (pEEG), wherein the frontal EEG signal is analyzed by proprietary algorithms to produce a dimensionless number (scaled from 0 to 100), wherein low values are associated with deepening levels of sedation that progresses to loss of consciousness. Such monitors have been shown to enable anesthetic titration so as to expedite emergence and early recovery, and their use is advocated for the prevention of intraoperative awareness in the setting of administration of total intravenous anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade. Whether their use can minimize, or prevent, longer term adverse events is a matter of debate. In this narrative review of the most recent literature, we provide an assessment on the use of pEEG monitors in the prevention of a notable, and important, postoperative adverse outcome - delirium - in elderly patients. As we will discuss, the existing data do not support its routine use for the prevention of postoperative delirium in this, or any other, patient population.","Evered, Lisbeth A; Goldstein, Peter A",International journal of general medicine,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s242230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469352/,636

These ~24-hour internal rhythms are set to precisely 24 hours daily by exposure to the sun. However, the prevalence of night-time lighting has the potential to dysregulate these biological functions. Hospital patients may be particularly vulnerable to the consequences of light at night because of their compromised physiological state. A mouse model of stroke (middle cerebral artery occlusion; MCAO) was used to test the hypothesis that exposure to dim light at night impairs responses to a major insult. Stroke lesion size was substantially larger among animals housed in dLAN after reperfusion than animals maintained in dark nights. Mice housed in dLAN for three days after the stroke displayed increased post-stroke anxiety-like behavior. Overall, dLAN amplified pro-inflammatory pathways in the CNS, which may have exacerbated neuronal damage.

We compared performances of single-use and reusable duodenoscopes in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). DESIGN Patients with native papilla requiring ERCP were randomised to single-use or reusable duodenoscope. Primary outcome was comparing number of attempts to achieve successful cannulation of desired duct. Secondary outcomes were technical performance that measured duodenoscope manoeuvrability, mechanical-imaging characteristics and ability to perform therapeutic interventions, need for advanced cannulation techniques or cross-over to alternate duodenoscope group to achieve ductal access and adverse events. RESULTS 98 patients were treated using single-use (n=48) or reusable (n=50) duodenoscopes with >80% graded as low-complexity procedures. While median number of attempts to achieve successful cannulation was significantly lower for single-use cohort (2 vs 5, p=0.013), ease of passage into stomach (p=0.047), image quality (p<0.001), image stability (p<0.001) and air-water button functionality (p<0.001) were significantly worse. There was no significant difference in rate of cannulation, adverse events including mortality (one patient in each group), need to cross-over or need for advanced cannulation techniques to achieve ductal access, between cohorts. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, only duodenoscope type (single-use) was associated with less than six attempts to achieve selective cannulation (p=0.012), when adjusted for patient demographics, procedural complexity and type of intervention. CONCLUSION Given the overall safety profile and similar technical performance, single-use duodenoscopes represent an alternative to reusable duodenoscopes for performing low-complexity ERCP procedures in experienced hands.

Institutional reforms and public spending restrictions may leverage public-private segmentation in health financing throughout the next decades, thus potentially leading to losses of equity in the system.

The aim of this study is to evaluate retrograde access to the PICA via the contralateral vertebral artery or the posterior communicating artery. METHODS Twenty-nine proximal PICA aneurysms treated by balloon remodeling with navigation of the balloon in the PICA via the contralateral vertebral artery or posterior communicating artery were found in our database between January 2007 and December 2013 and were reviewed. RESULTS Access to the PICA was made via the contralateral vertebral artery in 26 patients (90%), six of them (23%) with a hypoplastic V4 segment. In three patients (10%) the retrograde approach was made via the posterior communicating artery. After balloon remodeling, additional stenting was performed in 16 patients (55%). The complication rate was 3% (1 acute stent thrombosis). Grade 0 or 1 occlusion was obtained in all patients at completion angiography. No recurrence was found during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Retrograde access to the PICA to perform balloon-assisted coil embolization of proximal PICA aneurysms with or without additional stenting after coiling is safe and effective.

Telemedicine and mobile application are two common applications of digital technology in managing diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). The facilitators and barriers of using it for DFU management are yet to be explored. This is a qualitative systematic review. Five bibliography databases and grey literature sources were searched (2000-2019). Two reviewers independently screened the citations, extracted the data, assessed the quality of the included studies, and performed thematic synthesis. Three studies on patients and five studies on healthcare practitioners (HCPs) were included. Two studies focused on the use of mobile applications and six on telemedicine. In studies on patients, four analytical themes were generated: the relationships with HCPs; the attitude towards the usage of digital technology; the role of wound image taking; and impact of digital technology on DFU care, encompassing 15 facilitators (eg, enabling community support, improving wound care knowledge) and 12 barriers (eg, lack of technological savviness, difficulty reading on smartphones). Three analytical themes were generated from studies on HCPs: the impact of digital technology on HCPs; the role of digital technology in DFU care; and organisation of DFU care delivery, encompassing 17 facilitators (eg, adequate wound care training, digital technology enables holistic care) and 16 barriers (eg, lack of multidisciplinary approach in caring for DFU, lack of direct contact in care provision). Patients and HCPs reported various barriers and facilitators relating to different aspects of using digital technology in DFU management.

METHODS Between June 2011 and June 2015, 631 consecutive patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms underwent coil embolization at 6 hospitals. Among 53 patients who had thromboembolic complications, 15 patients harboring 15 aneurysms underwent rescue mechanical thrombectomy with a retrievable stent for the treatment of thromboembolic occlusion during the coiling of ruptured aneurysms. The patients' clinical and radiologic outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Of the 15 aneurysms, coiling alone was used for 13 (86.7%), and stent-assisted coiling was performed for 2 (13.3%). Thromboembolic occlusion most frequently occurred distal to the aneurysm (n=10, 66.7%), followed by proximal to the aneurysm (n=3, 20%), and at the coil-parent vessel interface (n=2, 13.3%). All patients underwent mechanical thrombectomy with a retrievable stent, including 5 patients who were initially treated with an IA tirofiban infusion. Complete recanalization (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 3) was obtained in 13 (86.7%) and partial recanalization (TICI 2b) in 2 (13.3%). Two patients who had received IA tirofiban before mechanical thrombectomy had hemorrhagic complications. At 6 months after discharge, 9 patients had a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 1, 3 patients were mRS 2, 1 patient was mRS 3, 1 patient was mRS 4, and 1 patient was mRS 6.

67059,Empowering patients through technology: GP Amir Hannan.,2021-01-18,"The histone locus body (HLB) assembles at replication-dependent (RD) histone loci and concentrates factors required for RD histone mRNA biosynthesis. The D. melanogaster genome has a single locus comprised of ∼100 copies of a tandemly arrayed 5 kB repeat unit containing one copy of each of the 5 RD histone genes. To determine sequence elements required for D. melanogaster HLB formation and histone gene expression, we used transgenic gene arrays containing 12 copies of the histone repeat unit that functionally complement loss of the ∼200 endogenous RD histone genes. A 12x histone gene array in which all H3-H4 promoters were replaced with H2a-H2b promoters (12xPR) does not form an HLB or express high levels of RD histone mRNA in the presence of the endogenous histone genes. In contrast, this same transgenic array is active in HLB assembly and RD histone gene expression in the absence of the endogenous RD histone genes and rescues the lethality caused by homozygous deletion of the RD histone locus. The HLB formed in the absence of endogenous RD histone genes on the mutant 12x array contains all known factors present in the wild type HLB including CLAMP, which normally binds to GAGA repeats in the H3-H4 promoter. These data suggest that multiple protein-protein and/or protein-DNA interactions contribute to HLB formation, and that the large number of endogenous RD histone gene copies sequester available factor(s) from attenuated transgenic arrays, thereby preventing HLB formation and gene expression.","Koreski, Kaitlin P; Rieder, Leila E; McLain, Lyndsey M; Chaubal, Ashlesha; Marzluff, William F; Duronio, Robert J",Molecular biology of the cell,https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e20-03-0176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32401666/,636
68251,Three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-08-18,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a systemic disease characterized by both lung pathology and widespread extrapulmonary virus dissemination causing multiple organ injuries. In this regard, renal dysfunction is an ominous sign in patients with SARS. Indeed, clusters of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) particles have been detected in the cytoplasm of renal tubular epithelial cells in postmortem studies, explaining the presence of infectious virus in the urine of SARS patients. In order to investigate the potential SARS-CoV kidney tropism, we have evaluated the susceptibility of human renal cells of tubular and glomerular origin to in vitro SARS-CoV infection. Immortalized cultures of differentiated proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC), glomerular mesangial cells (MC), and glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes) were found to express the SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 on their surface. Productive infection, however, occurred only in PTEC but not in glomerular cells. A transient infection with poor virus production was observed in MC, whereas podocytes were not permissive to SARS-CoV infection. In contrast to the cytopathic infection of the Vero E6 cell line, SARS-CoV did not cause overt cytopathic effects in PTEC or MC. Of interest, PTEC, but not MC, maintained stable levels of SARS-CoV production in serial subcultures, suggesting a persistent state of infection. In this regard, a SARS-CoV variant with increased replication capacity in PTEC was selected after four serial subculture passages. This SARS-CoV variant acquired a single nonconservative amino acid change from glutamic acid (E) to alanine (A) at position 11 in the viral membrane (M) protein. The E11A point mutation was sufficient for enhanced SARS-CoV replication and persistence in PTEC when introduced in a SARS-CoV recombinant infectious clone. These findings indicate that human PTEC may represent a site of SARS-CoV productive and persistent replication favoring the emergence of viral variants with increased replication capacity, at least in these kidney cells.","Pacciarini, Filippo; Ghezzi, Silvia; Canducci, Filippo; Sims, Amy; Sampaolo, Michela; Ferioli, Elena; Clementi, Massimo; Poli, Guido; Conaldi, Pier Giulio; Baric, Ralph; Vicenzi, Elisa",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00096-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18367528/,636

METHODS we evaluated the metabolic profile of 304 individuals with T2DM (65% males; age 69±9 years; diabetes duration 16±10 years) attending our Diabetes Unit early at the end of lockdown period (June 8 to July 7, 2020) and compared it with the latest one recorded before lockdown. RESULTS There was no significant difference in fasting plasma glucose (8.6±2.1 vs 8.8±2.5 mmol/L; P=0.353) and HbA1c (7.1±0.9 vs 7.1±0.9%; P=0.600) before and after lockdown. Worsening of glycaemic control (i.e., ΔHbA1c≥0.5%) occurred more frequently in older patients (32.2% in >80 years vs 21.3% in 61-80 years vs 9.3% in < 60 years; P=0.05) and in insulin users (28.8 vs 16.5%; P=0.012). On multivariable analysis, age >80 years (OR 4.62; 95%CI: 1.22-16.07) and insulin therapy (OR 1.96; 95%CI: 1.10-3.50) remained independently associated to worsening in glycaemic control. CONCLUSIONS Home confinement related to COVID-19 lockdown did not exert a negative effect on glycaemic control in patients with T2DM. However, age and insulin therapy can identify patients at greatest risk of deterioration of glycaemic control.","Falcetta, Pierpaolo; Aragona, Michele; Ciccarone, Annamaria; Bertolotto, Alessandra; Campi, Fabrizio; Coppelli, Alberto; Dardano, Angela; Giannarelli, Rosa; Bianchi, Cristina; Del Prato, Stefano",Diabetes research and clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2021.108750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33722703/,636
69368,Pay gaps in medicine and the impact of COVID-19 on doctors' careers.,2020-12-15,"Research has suggested that a high variability in foot strike pattern during downhill running is associated with lower neuromuscular fatigue of the plantar flexors (PF). Given the popularity of trail running, we designed an intervention study to investigate whether a strategy with regular changes in foot strike pattern during downhill running could reduce the extent of fatigue on neuromuscular, energetics and biomechanical parameters as well as increase an uphill time-to-exhaustion trial (TTE) performance. Fourteen experienced trail runners completed two interventional conditions (separated by 15 days) in a pseudo-randomized and counter-balanced order that consisted of 2.5-h of treadmill graded running with (switch condition) or without (control condition) a change between fore- and rear-foot strike pattern every 30 s during the downhill sections. Pre and Post, neuromuscular tests were performed to assess PF central and peripheral fatigue. Energy cost of running was assessed using an indirect calorimetry system and biomechanical gait parameters were acquired with an instrumented treadmill. TTE was performed after both the graded running conditions. There were not significant condition × time interactions (P ≥ 0.085) for any of the variables considered, and TTE was not different between the two conditions (P = 0.755). A deliberate strategy to alternate between foot strike patterns did not reduce the extent of fatigue during prolonged graded running. We suggest that it is not the ability to switch between foot strike patterns that minimises fatigue; rather the ability to adapt foot strike pattern to the terrain and therefore a better running technique.","Vernillo, Gianluca; Aguiar, Matheus; Savoldelli, Aldo; Martinez, Aaron; Giandolini, Marlene; Horvais, Nicolas; Brent Edwards, W; Millet, Guillaume Y",European journal of sport science,https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2019.1645212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311427/,636
69371,An Illumination of the ICN's Core Competencies in Disaster Nursing Version 2.0: Response of advanced practice nurses to COVID-19 outbreak in China.,2020-10-26,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS Temporary tracheotomies are commonly performed in head and neck cancer surgery. The aim of this study was to propose a minimum peak inspiratory flow (PIF) as a standardized simple tool for successful decannulation after surgery. STUDY DESIGN Prospective review between January 2011 and June 2013 in a university teaching hospital. METHODS Fifty-six patients after head and neck cancer surgery requiring tracheotomies were included. Decannulation failure was defined as the need to recannulate patients within 24 hours. PIF values did not influence the decisions to decannulate or recannulate. Pre- and postdecannulation PIF values, measured with a handheld PIF meter (In-Check Dial), were registered until definitive decannulation. RESULTS A total of 67 decannulation attempts were performed, with 47 positive and nine negative decannulations at the first attempt. Of the latter, seven were positive at the second attempt and two at the third. All patients were decannulated (mean, 6.3 days). PIF values of 40 L/min appear to be the threshold with the best sensitivity (90%) and specificity (95%) for predicting decannulation success. There was a significant difference (P < .001) between mean PIF in the positive (86 L/min) and negative (20 L/min) decannulation groups and between mean PIF values with (77 L/min) and without cannula (100 L/min). CONCLUSIONS PIF ≥40 L/min with cannula (>60 L/min without) using the In-Check Dial oral method is a threshold associated with decannulation success. PIF is a simple quantitative parameter for evaluating the upper airway, aiding the decision to decannulate safely.

METHODS Psychiatric outpatient visits and patient diagnostic information were extracted from the EHR(electronic health records) of a Korean tertiary hospital during 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and 3 months before the COVID-19 outbreak. Visit rates of psychiatric outpatients according to primary psychiatric diagnosis category before and after the COVID-19 pandemic were compared using an over-dispersed Poisson regression model. The temporal associations between the number of daily outpatient visits and the daily number of newly confirmed cases were examined by time-series analysis within each diagnosis category. RESULTS Total daily outpatient visit rate was significantly reduced during the pandemic. Among the nine most prevalent diagnosis categories, the daily visit rates for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders were significantly reduced by about 29.8%, 14.8%, and 13.3% respectively. Time-series analysis showed significant temporal correlations between the daily number of newly confirmed cases and the daily visit rates for anxiety disorders and depressive disorders, whereas patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders showed no significant temporal association. LIMITATIONS Potential confounding factors unrelated to the pandemic might have influenced the results. CONCLUSIONS The present findings suggest that patients with anxiety or depressive disorders may have concerns regarding the spread of COVID-19, and may be more reluctant to visit psychiatry outpatient clinics. Delivery strategies for mental healthcare services, such as telepsychiatry, would be helpful to enhance continuity of care during the pandemic.","Seo, Jun Ho; Kim, Se Joo; Lee, Myeongjee; Kang, Jee In",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.04.070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34015622/,636
70912,Can angiotensin receptor-blocking drugs perhaps be harmful in the COVID-19 pandemic?,2020-03-11,"Epigenetic regulation plays a critical role in controlling fungal secondary metabolism. Here, we report the pleiotropic effects of the epigenetic regulator HdaA (histone deacetylase) on secondary metabolite production and the associated biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) expression in the plant endophytic fungus Penicillium chrysogenum Fes1701. Deletion of the hdaA gene in strain Fes1701 induced a significant change of the secondary metabolite profile with the emergence of the bioactive indole alkaloid meleagrin. Simultaneously, more meleagrin/roquefortine-related compounds and less chrysogine were synthesized in the ΔhdaA strain. Transcriptional analysis of relevant gene clusters in ΔhdaA and wild strains indicated that disruption of hdaA had different effects on the expression levels of two BGCs: the meleagrin/roquefortine BGC was upregulated, while the chrysogine BGC was downregulated. Interestingly, transcriptional analysis demonstrated that different functional genes in the same BGC had different responses to the disruption of hdaA. Thereinto, the roqO gene, which encodes a key catalyzing enzyme in meleagrin biosynthesis, showed the highest upregulation in the ΔhdaA strain (84.8-fold). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the upregulation of HdaA inactivation on meleagrin/roquefortine alkaloid production in the endophytic fungus P. chrysogenum. Our results suggest that genetic manipulation based on the epigenetic regulator HdaA is an important strategy for regulating the productions of secondary metabolites and expanding bioactive natural product resources in endophytic fungi.","Ding, Zhuang; Zhou, Haibo; Wang, Xiao; Huang, Huiming; Wang, Haotian; Zhang, Ruiyan; Wang, Zhengping; Han, Jun",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25163657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796640/,636

However, Th cell polarization in viral- or bacterial-mediated ALI is not well defined. Herein, an influenza virus (A/FM/1/47, H1N1) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were chosen to induce ALI in mice, and the resultant diversity of Th-cell polarization was explored. METHODOLOGY BALB/c mice were challenged intranasally with the influenza virus or LPS. Edema of the lung, infiltration of inflammatory cells (macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes), oxidative stress, and signature cytokines of Th1 and Th2 cells were detected at 2 days post virus or LPS challenge. RESULTS The mice exhibited increased capillary permeability accompanied by lung edema and protein-rich alveolar exudation after virus or LPS challenge. Additionally, excessive infiltration of inflammatory cells, robust oxidative stress, and cytokine production were observed in both mouse groups. However, there was conspicuous disparity in the inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokines between the virus- and LPS-challenged mice, where the infiltration in virus-challenged mice was mainly of macrophages and accompanied by robust Th1 cytokine elevation, whereas the infiltration in LPS-challenged mice was primarily of neutrophils and accompanied by robust Th2 cytokine elevation. CONCLUSIONS The Th cell polarization was skewed depending on whether ALI was induced by the influenza virus or LPS. The polarization in the virus-challenged mice was primarily toward a Th1 response, whereas that in the LPS-challenged mice was mainly toward Th2.","Liu, Jian-Xing; Zhang, Ying; An, Miao; Wu, Qing-Guang; Zhao, Ya; Li, Xiong; Li, Geng",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.10338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32058989/,636

MATERIAL AND METHODS The prospectively collected data of patients who underwent thyroid surgery with intraoperative neuromonitoring for external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve exploration were assessed retrospectively. The surface endotracheal tube-based Medtronic NIM3 intraoperative neuromonitoring device was used. The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve function was evaluated by the cricothyroid muscle twitch. In addition, contribution of external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve to the vocal cord adduction was evaluated using electromyographic records. RESULTS The study included data of 126 (female, 103; male, 23) patients undergoing thyroid surgery, with a mean age of 46.2±12.2 years (range, 18-75 years), and 215 neck sides were assessed. Two hundred and one (93.5%) of 215 external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves were identified, of which 60 (27.9%) were identified visually before being stimulated with a monopolar stimulator probe. Eighty-nine (41.4%) external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves were identified visually after being identified with a probe. Although 52 (24.1%) external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves were identified with a probe, they were not visualized. Intraoperative neuromonitoring provided a significant contribution to visual (p<0.001) and functional (p<0.001) identification of external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves. Additionally, positive electromyographic responses were recorded from 160 external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves (74.4%). CONCLUSION Intraoperative neuromonitoring provides an important contribution to visual and functional identification of external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves. We believe that it can not be predicted whether the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is at risk or not and the nerve is often invisible; thus, intraoperative neuromonitoring may routinely be used in superior pole dissection. Glottic electromyography response obtained via external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve stimulation provides quantifiable information in addition to the simple visualization of the cricothyroid muscle twitch.","Aygün, Nurcihan; Uludağ, Mehmet; İşgör, Adnan",Turkish journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.5152/turkjsurg.2017.3645; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28944328/,636

METHOD We created a web-based survey regarding the changes in clinical, research, and educational activity of Neurology trainees in Italy during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the preventive measures undertaken by local Institutions to reduce the risk of contagion. RESULTS 79 residents working in Italy completed the survey. 87.3% of trainees reported a substantial reduction in their neurological duties since SARS-CoV-2 appeared in Italy, and 17.8% were also recruited or volunteered for COVID-19-dedicated wards. Likewise, more than 60% of trainees experienced a reduction or interruption in research activity. As regards the perceived impact of COVID-19 outbreak on their neurological training, almost 70% of surveyed trainees believe that SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had or will have a negative impact on their formation as neurologists, for different reasons. Furthermore, trainees reported a consistent exposure (69.6%) to confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 cases at work, with divergent surveillance and preventive measures taken by local institutions. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the survey shows that SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Italy has had a subjective negative impact for Neurology residents on didactics, clinical, and research training as well as training abroad. SARS-CoV-2 outbreak poses many challenges to our academic institutions and training programs, and addressing these issues promptly is crucial to ensure continued quality of trainees' neurological education.

However, its long-term efficacy and outcome of treatment beyond progression (TBP) with nivolumab have not been clarified. METHODS The 3-year follow-up data were collected. A subset analysis was performed to explore the efficacy of TBP by assessing postprogression survival (PPS) after the first event of disease progression. RESULTS Overall, 493 patients were randomized (2:1) to receive nivolumab (n = 330) or placebo (n = 163). With a median follow-up of 38.5 (range 36.1-47.5) months, OS of the nivolumab group was significantly longer compared to the placebo group (median 5.3 vs 4.1 months; 3-year survival rate, 5.6% vs 1.9%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-0.75], P < 0.0001). The median OS of responders (n = 32) who achieved complete response or partial response was 26.7 months and the 3-year survival rate was 35.5% in the nivolumab group. Overall, 109 patients in the nivolumab group and 37 patients in the placebo group received TBP. PPS tended to be longer in the nivolumab group vs placebo group (median 5.8 vs 4.5 months; HR [95% CI], 0.69 [0.47-1.01], P = 0.057). In contrast, PPS was similar between both treatment groups in non-TBP patients (median 2.3 vs 2.2 months; HR 0.90, P = 0.42). CONCLUSIONS Long-term efficacy of nivolumab was confirmed at the 3-year follow-up, and a survival benefit of TBP with nivolumab was suggested. Biomarkers for selecting patients suitable for TBP with nivolumab should be identified in the future.","Boku, Narikazu; Satoh, Taroh; Ryu, Min-Hee; Chao, Yee; Kato, Ken; Chung, Hyun Cheol; Chen, Jen-Shi; Muro, Kei; Kang, Won Ki; Yeh, Kun-Huei; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Oh, Sang Cheul; Bai, Li-Yuan; Tamura, Takao; Lee, Keun-Wook; Hamamoto, Yasuo; Kim, Jong Gwang; Chin, Keisho; Oh, Do-Youn; Minashi, Keiko; Cho, Jae Yong; Tsuda, Masahiro; Nishiyama, Taihei; Chen, Li-Tzong; Kang, Yoon-Koo",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-021-01173-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33743112/,636

72821,Pediatric Surgical Reentry Strategy Following the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Tiered and Balanced Approach.,2021-05-19,"BACKGROUND Reduced ventilation in lung regions affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), reflected as inhomogeneities in the single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) lung image, is correlated to disease advancement. An analysis method for measuring these inhomogeneities is proposed in this work. The first aim was to develop a quantitative analysis method that could discriminate between Monte Carlo simulated normal and COPD lung SPECT images. A second aim was to evaluate the ability of the present method to discriminate between human subjects with advanced COPD and healthy volunteers. METHODS In the simulated COPD study, different activity distributions in the lungs were created to mimic the healthy lung (normal) and different levels of COPD. Gamma camera projections were Monte Carlo simulated, representing clinically acquired projections of a patient who had inhaled 125 MBq 99mTc-Technegas followed by a 10-min SPECT examination. Reconstructions were made with iterative ordered subset expectation maximisation. The coefficient of variance (CV) was calculated for small overlapping volumes covering the 3D reconstructed activity distribution. A CV threshold value (CVT) was calculated as the modal value of the CV distribution of the simulated normal. The area under the distribution curve (AUC), for CV values greater than CVT, AUC(CVT), was then calculated. Moreover, five patients with advanced emphysema and five healthy volunteers inhaled approximately 75 MBq 99mTc-Technegas immediately before the 20-min SPECT acquisition. In the human study, CVT was based on the mean CV distribution of the five healthy volunteers. RESULTS A significant difference (p < 0.001) was found between the Monte-Carlo simulated normal and COPD lung SPECT examinations. The present method identified a total reduction of ventilation of approximately 5%, not visible to the human eye in the reconstructed image. In humans the same method clearly discriminated between the five healthy volunteers and five patients with advanced COPD (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS While our results are promising, the potential of the AUC(CVT) method to detect less advanced COPD in patients needs further clinical studies.","Norberg, Pernilla; Persson, Hans Lennart; Carlsson, Gudrun Alm; Bake, Björn; Kentson, Magnus; Sandborg, Michael; Gustafsson, Agnetha",EJNMMI research,https://doi.org/10.1186/2191-219x-3-28; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23597059/,636

There are presently several research studies on the atmospheric environmental and economic effects of this dreaded virus. Supposedly, the responses ought to have also present innovations that would advance scientific research to mitigate its impacts since most of the ensuing consequences impact the atmospheric climatic conditions. Even when it appears that economic events would possibly return in no time, the circumstances will change. Specifically, from the existing literature, it appears that not much has been done to study the influence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on climate change. Hence, this present review article will explore the possible connection between the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and climate change.

75014,"Change in Reported Adherence to Nonpharmaceutical Interventions During the COVID-19 Pandemic, April-November 2020.",2021-01-22,"RATIONALE Acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory disorder characterized by hypoxemia and diffuse infiltration of neutrophils into the alveolar space. The migration and extravasation of neutrophils is guided through positive guidance cues, such as chemokines. Recent work has identified the neuronal guidance protein netrin-1 to be a negative guidance cue for leukocyte migration and to hold antiinflammatory potential. OBJECTIVES To test the role of pulmonary netrin-1 during ALI. METHODS Pulmonary netrin-1 expression was evaluated during acute inflammation in vitro and in vivo; the netrin-1 promoter was studied using pGL4 luciferase reporter. ALI was induced through LPS inhalation and mechanical ventilation in wild-type, Ntn1(+/-), and A2BAR(-/-) animals. Exogenous netrin-1 was used to evaluate its impact on pulmonary inflammation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Wild-type animals demonstrated repression of pulmonary netrin-1 after LPS inhalation. In vitro studies confirmed the repression of netrin-1. Studies in the putative netrin-1 promoter identified a nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent mechanism to be involved in this repression. Ntn1(+/-) animals demonstrated increased inflammatory changes after LPS inhalation compared with Ntn1(+/+) animals. Reconstitution with netrin-1 dampened the infiltration of neutrophils and cytokine production in the alveolar space. This effect was dependent on the adenosine 2b receptor. The importance of netrin-1 for the control of pulmonary inflammation could be corroborated in a model of ventilator-induced lung injury. CONCLUSIONS Pulmonary netrin-1 levels are repressed during ALI. This results in pronounced pulmonary damage, an increased infiltration of neutrophils, and increased pulmonary inflammation. Exogenous netrin-1 significantly dampens the extent of ALI through the adenosine 2B receptor.","Mirakaj, Valbona; Thix, Cyril A; Laucher, Stefanie; Mielke, Carina; Morote-Garcia, Julio C; Schmit, Marthe A; Henes, Janek; Unertl, Klaus E; Köhler, David; Rosenberger, Peter",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200905-0717oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20075388/,636
75823,Reframing the Opioid Epidemic as a National Emergency.,2017,"INTRODUCTION This retrospective analysis aimed to characterize patients with migraine initiating erenumab and the shifting or trend of patient characteristics over time in a real-world setting. METHODS Adult patients with at least one erenumab written prescription/administration between May 1, 2018 and September 30, 2019 were identified from the Optum De-identified Electronic Health Record (EHR) database (index date = date of the first erenumab prescription/administration). Patient demographics and characteristics, acute and preventive medications used prior to initiation of erenumab, and the initial prescriber specialty were examined. In addition, the shifting or trends of patient characteristics over time were analyzed among subgroups of patients based on when they initiated erenumab. RESULTS A total of 14,774 eligible patients who met inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the analysis. Most patients were female (86.4%), average age 46.3 (standard deviation [SD] = 13.1) years, Caucasian (88.7%), non-Hispanic (91.8%), and commercially insured (59.8%) at the index date. During the 12-month pre-index period, commonly observed selected comorbid conditions included anxiety (30.6%), depression (28.2%), and cardiovascular diseases (26.4%), and the mean (SD) Elixhauser comorbidity score was 1.7 (5.5). The most common provider specialty at erenumab initiation was neurologist/headache specialist (46.5%). Over time, there was a decrease in mean baseline Elixhauser comorbidity score at erenumab initiation, an increase in general practitioners prescribing initial erenumab, and increased utilization in patients with less severe migraine overall (a proxy of the declining trend in chronic migraine and triptan use). CONCLUSION Early use of erenumab post approval focused on patients with more severe disease and a high comorbidity index rating. Over time, utilization of this preventive medication occurred in a broader population of patients with migraine, with increased use by general practitioners and those outside of headache centers.","Fang, Juanzhi; Korrer, Stephanie; Johnson, Jonathan C; Cheadle, Mark A; Shah, Roshani; Ferraris, Matias L; Lopez, Cristina",Advances in therapy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-021-01677-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763828/,636

BACKGROUND Controversy exists regarding which technique, the open and laparoscopic, if any, is superior to the other. In addition, there is the question of which approach is best in rescuing malfunctioning PD catheters. RESULTS Rather than promoting one doctrine fits all, philosophically, doing the right thing for the patient by specific criteria is ethically the better model. These specific selection criteria include patient characteristics, the team's skills and knowledge and institutional resources and commitment. Also, the sophistication of a PD unit for training and monitoring of patients is crucial for successful outcomes. Open paramedian and two laparoscopic approaches are described in detail, outlining advantages and disadvantages of each, with suggestions when one method is preferred. CONCLUSIONS In general, the laparoscopic technique is associated with longer operative times, higher costs and the need to utilize general anesthesia. It is, however, the preferred method when rescuing malfunctioning catheters and may increase the PD patient population in patients with previous abdominal surgeries. The dialysis access surgeon should be familiar with both open and laparoscopic techniques and appropriately choose the ideal method based upon the individual patient and institutional resources.","Hwang, Christine; Davidson, Ingemar; Santarelli, Stefano; Zeiler, Matthias; Ceraudo, Emilio; Pedone, Meri; Saxena, Ramesh; Slakey, Douglas; Wade, Melissa; Gallieni, Maurizio",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.5301/jva.5000174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24043329/,636

A Multi-Center Comparative Study and Cost Analysis.,2020,"Understanding how evolution promotes pathogen emergence would aid disease management, and prediction of future host shifts. Increased pathogen infectiousness of different hosts may occur through direct selection, or fortuitously via indirect selection. However, it is unclear which type of selection tends to produce host breadth promoting pathogen emergence. We predicted that direct selection for host breadth should foster emergence by causing higher population growth on new hosts, lower among-population variance in growth on new hosts, and lower population variance in growth across new hosts. We tested the predictions using experimentally evolved vesicular stomatitis virus populations, containing groups of host-use specialists, directly selected generalists, and indirectly selected generalists. In novel-host challenges, viruses directly selected for generalism showed relatively higher or equivalent host growth, lower among-population variance in host growth, and lower population variance in growth across hosts. Thus, two of three outcomes supported our prediction that directly selected host breadth should favor host colonization. Also, we observed that indirectly selected generalists were advantaged over specialist viruses, indicating that fortuitous changes in host breadth may also promote emergence. We discuss evolution of phenotypic plasticity versus environmental robustness in viruses, virus avoidance of extinction, and surveillance of pathogen niche breadth to predict future likelihood of emergence.","Turner, Paul E; Morales, Nadya M; Alto, Barry W; Remold, Susanna K",Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01051.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20633045/,636

To increase diagnostic capacity and reduce the risk of diagnostic delay, CT colonography (CTC) and colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) are increasingly being relied upon. Endoscopic assessment and treatment will be required for those patients with large colonic polyps or malignant tumours detected by CTC or CCE, provided they are fit enough to undergo further investigation. The management of patients with intermediate (6-9mm) and diminutive (<6mm) colonic polyps, reported by CTC and CCE, will increasingly be decided by clinicians. Published literature suggests the risk of progression to malignancy of intermediate or diminutive polyps over 3 years is low. Furthermore, the risk of intermediate or diminutive polyps harbouring malignancy is extremely low. The benefits, and timeline, for the removal of these polyps must be carefully considered for patients. We present a pragmatic approach to managing intermediate and diminutive polyps. We suggest delayed polypectomy (up to one year) for patients with intermediate polyps who are likely to benefit. For those patients with diminutive polyps, we advocate further surveillance only for younger patients where clinical concern exists. This meets the aspirations of Realistic Medicine, providing a risk-based approach for patients, while appropriately prioritising resources.","MacLeod, C; Mowat, C; Winters, J; Todd, J; Ray, C; Maxwell, F; McKinley, A; Noble, C; Collins, P; Wilson, L; Cruikshank, N; Hendry, P; Leggett, G; Fletcher, J; Weber, B; Moug, S; Watson, Ajm",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34510684/,636
78796,Is Regional Anesthesia Enough Safe in Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 Patients?,2020-03-30,"OBJECTIVE First-rib resection is a key component of the treatment of Paget-Schroetter disease. There are many controversies regarding the management of this disease. We report a safe, effective, minimally invasive robotic transthoracic approach for resection of the first rib. METHODS Over an 8-month period, five patients underwent robotic first-rib resection. Preoperative assessment included physical examination and bilateral venous angiography. On a thoracoscopic platform using three 2-cm incisions and one 1-cm incision, the robot was used to dissect the first rib and divide the scalene muscles. Success of the first-rib resection was assessed by postoperative venous angiography. RESULTS There were four men and one woman. Mean age was 34.6 ± 10 years. Mean operative time was 195 ± 24.6 minutes. There were no complications and no mortality. All patients had a patent subclavian vein on the postoperative venogram and were anticoagulated with warfarin for 3 months. At a median follow-up of 12 months, all patients had an open subclavian vein for a patency rate of 100%. CONCLUSIONS Robotic thoracoscopic first-rib resection represents a feasible minimally invasive approach to en bloc resection of the first rib. This technique minimizes the risk of neurovascular complications that are associated with conventional techniques.","Gharagozloo, Farid; Meyer, Mark; Tempesta, Barbara J; Margolis, Marc; Strother, Eric T; Tummala, Srini",Innovations,https://doi.org/10.1097/imi.0b013e3182542ab3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22576034/,636

81273,Some reflections on vaccine research ethics during COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-02-09,"CCR5 (R5)-tropic, but not CXCR4 (X4)-tropic, HIV-1 is associated with primary HIV-1 infection and transmission. Recent studies have shown that IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins, including IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, restrict a broad range of viruses. Here, we demonstrate that an IFITM2 isoform (Δ20 IFITM2) lacking 20 amino acids at the N terminus differentially restricts X4 and R5 HIV-1. Δ20 IFITM2 suppresses replication of X4 HIV-1 strains by inhibiting their entry. High levels of Δ20 IFITM2 expression could be detected in CD4+ T cells and in monocytes. Infection of X4 viruses in monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells is enhanced upon depletion of IFITM2 isoforms. Furthermore, we also show that coreceptor use is the determining factor for differential HIV-1 restriction of Δ20 IFITM2. When we replace the C terminus of CCR5 with the C terminus of CXCR4, R5 viruses become more susceptible to Δ20 IFITM2-mediated restriction. In contrast to previous studies, our research reveals that neither X4 nor R5 HIV-1 is suppressed by IFITM2 and IFITM3. The multifactor gatekeeping model has been proposed to explain restriction of X4 viruses in the early stage of HIV-1 diseases. Our findings indicate that Δ20 IFITM2 may serve as a major contributor to this gatekeeping mechanism.","Wu, Wan-Lin; Grotefend, Christopher Robert; Tsai, Ming-Ting; Wang, Yi-Ling; Radic, Vladimir; Eoh, Hyungjin; Huang, I-Chueh",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1619640114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28630320/,636

METHODS From December 2001 to February 2016, 270 liver transplantations were performed at San Camillo Hospital. IH occurred in 78 patients (28.8%). IH usually appeared early within the first year post-orthotopic liver transplantation. In the first era, fascial defect was repaired by primary closure for defects smaller than 2.5 cm or with synthetic mesh for greater defects. Recently, we started using biological mesh (Permacol™, Covidien). We present a series of five transplanted patients submitted to surgery for abdominal wall defect correction repaired with biological mesh (Permacol™, Covidien). RESULTS In our cases, the use of biological prosthesis (Permacol™, Covidien) have proven to be effective and versatile in repairing hernia defects of different kinds; patients did not suffer infections of the prosthesis and no recurrence was observed. Furthermore, the prosthesis remains intact even in the years after surgery. CONCLUSION The cases that we presented show that the use of biological mesh (Permacol™, Covidien) in transplanted patients may be safe and effective, being careful in the management of perioperative immunosuppression and renal and graft function, although the cost of the product itself has been the main limiting factor and there is need for prospective studies for further evaluations.","Vennarecci, Giovanni; Mascianà, Gianluca; De Werra, Edoardo; Sandri, Giovanni Battista Levi; Ferraro, Daniele; Burocchi, Mirco; Tortorelli, Giovanni; Guglielmo, Nicola; Ettorre, Giuseppe Maria",World journal of transplantation,https://doi.org/10.5500/wjt.v7.i1.43; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28280694/,636

We hypothesized that abdominal muscle stretching as a passive operation would have a beneficial effect on a biochemical index of the activity of the sympathetic/adrenomedullary system (salivary CgA) and anxiety. METHODS Fifteen control and eighteen untreated IBS subjects underwent experimental abdominal muscle stretching for 4 min. Subjects relaxed in a supine position with their knees fully flexed while their pelvic and trunk rotation was passively and slowly moved from 0 degrees of abdominal rotation to about 90 degrees or the point where the subject reported feeling discomfort.Changes in the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), ordinate scale and salivary CgA levels were compared between controls and IBS subjects before and after stretching. A three-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) with period (before vs. after) as the within-subject factor and group (IBS vs. Control), and sex (men vs. female) as the between-subject factors was carried out on salivary CgA. RESULTS CgA showed significant interactions between period and groups (F[1, 31] = 4.89, p = 0.03), and between groups and sex (F[1, 31] = 4.73, p = 0.03). Interactions between period and sex of CgA secretion were not shown (F[1, 3] = 2.60, p = 0.12). At the baseline, salivary CgA in IBS subjects (36.7 +/- 5.9 pmol/mg) was significantly higher than in controls (19.9 +/- 5.5 pmol/mg, p < 0.05). After the stretching, salivary CgA significantly decreased in the IBS group (25.5 +/- 4.5 pmol/mg), and this value did not differ from that in controls (18.6 +/- 3.9 pmol/mg). CONCLUSION Our results suggest the possibility of improving IBS pathophysiology by passive abdominal muscle stretching as indicated by CgA, a biochemical index of the activity of the sympathetic/adrenomedullary system.","Hamaguchi, Toyohiro; Fukudo, Shin; Kanazawa, Motoyori; Tomiie, Tadaaki; Shimizu, Kunihiko; Oyama, Mineo; Sakurai, Kohji",BioPsychoSocial medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/1751-0759-2-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18983682/,636

Traditional fixation methods have been implicated as a source of chronic postoperative pain. We report 2-year outcomes with a self-gripping mesh for open tension-free repair of large incisional hernia. METHODS This prospective case series enrolled 20 patients with large primary incisional hernia (mean defect size: 84 cm(2)). Patients were electively treated by a single surgeon using a macroporous polyester mesh with resorbable polylactic acid microgrips (ProGrip, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) using open onlay technique. Main outcomes included pain severity, Carolinas Comfort Scale (CCS), complications, and hernia recurrence. Patients returned for follow-up at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. RESULTS Median mesh fixation time was 2 min. Mean operative time was 38 min and blood loss was minimal (50 cc). Most patients (75%) were discharged same day. The only perioperative complication was a minor seroma in one patient. Patient follow-up compliance through 2 years was 100%. Mean pain score was 1.8 at discharge, 0.9 at 1 month, 0.7 at 1 year, and 0 at 2 years. At 2-years, all patients were ""very satisfied"" with treatment and hernia-specific quality of life was excellent (mean CCS score = 0). No infection, mesh removal, or hernia recurrence occurred during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Open repair using a self-gripping mesh is a viable treatment option in patients with large incisional hernia.

In this study, the optimization, therapeutic efficacy, and toxicity of PRIT of colon cancer with a (177)Lu-labeled peptide was determined in mice with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-expressing human tumors. METHODS To obtain the optimal therapeutic efficacy, several strategies were evaluated to increase the total amount of radioactivity targeted to subcutaneous LS174T colon cancer tumors in BALB/c nude mice. First, the maximum amount of bispecific anti-CEA and antihapten antibody TF2 and the peptide IMP288 that could be targeted was determined. Second, the tumor targeting of repeated administrations of radiolabeled IMP288 was investigated. Mice received 1 TF2 injection, followed by multiple IMP288 injections (3-h interval) or multiple cycles, with each IMP288 administration preceded by a new TF2 injection (72-h interval). PRIT was administered at maximum doses of TF2 and (177)Lu-labeled IMP288 in groups of 9 mice with subcutaneous LS174T tumors. Mice received 1, 2, or 3 successive cycles of treatment (26 MBq/mouse/cycle) or carrier only. The primary endpoint was survival; secondary endpoints were tumor growth, body weight, bone marrow, and renal toxicity. RESULTS The highest amount of radioactivity delivered to a subcutaneous colon tumor was achieved by the administration of 5.0 nmol of TF2 and 0.28 nmol of IMP288 in 3 successive cycles, with each IMP288 preceded by a new TF2 injection (72-h interval). PRIT effectively delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival significantly. Higher activity doses, administered in successive cycles, correlated with longer survival: the median survival of untreated mice was 13 d (range, 6-20 d), whereas that of mice treated with 1, 2, or 3 cycles of PRIT was 24 (range, 24-31 d), 45 (range, 38 ≥ 130 d), and 65 (range, 48 ≥ 130 d) days, respectively. Toxicity was limited: no significant changes in mean body weight were measured. Minimal changes in leukocyte counts were measured at 2 and 3 wk after injection, with full recovery within 7 wk after treatment. Platelet counts were unaffected. Serum creatinine levels were not increased significantly; thus, there was no indication of acute renal toxicity. CONCLUSION This study indicates that PRIT in mice is an effective treatment modality against colon cancer, with limited toxicity.","Schoffelen, Rafke; van der Graaf, Winette T A; Franssen, Gerben; Sharkey, Robert M; Goldenberg, David M; McBride, William J; Rossi, Edmund A; Eek, Annemarie; Oyen, Wim J G; Boerman, Otto C","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.110.079376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21051650/,636
87335,COVID-19 and Nurse-Sensitive Indicators: Using Performance Improvement Teams to Address Quality Indicators During a Pandemic.,2020-10-19,"BACKGROUND The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has caused a persistent decline in childhood vaccination coverage, including Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, in some countries. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of decreased Hib vaccination due to COVID-19 on invasive Hib disease burden in Japan. METHODS Using a deterministic dynamic transmission model (susceptible-carriage-infection-recovery model), the incidence rates of invasive Hib disease in under 5 year olds in rapid vaccination recovery and persistent vaccination declined scenarios were compared for the next 10 years after 2020. The national Hib vaccination rate after the impact of COVID-19 reduced to 87% and 73% in 2020 from approximately 97% each in 2013-2019 for primary and booster doses. RESULTS While the persistent decline scenarios revealed an increase in invasive Hib disease incidence to 0.50/100,000 children under 5 years old, the incidence of the rapid recovery scenario slightly increased with a consistent decline of incidence after 2021. The shorter the duration of the decline in vaccination rate was, the smaller the incremental disease burden observed in the model. Compared to the rapid recovery scenario, the permanent decline scenario showed a 296.87 cumulative incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALY) loss for the next 10 years. CONCLUSIONS The persistent decline of Hib vaccination rate due to COVID-19 causes an incremental disease burden irrespective of the possible decline of Hib transmission rate by COVID-19 mitigation measures. A rapid recovery of vaccination coverage rate can prevent this possible incremental disease burden.","Kitano, Taito; Aoki, Hirosato",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.11.053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33280853/,636

METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of all robot-assisted umbilical, epigastric and incisional hernia repairs performed at our institution between 2013 and 2015 compared to laparoscopic umbilical or epigastric hernia repairs. Patient characteristics, operative details and postoperative complications were collected and analyzed using univariate analysis. Three primary minimally invasive fellowship trained surgeons performed all of the procedures included in the analysis. RESULTS 72 patients were identified during the study period. 39 patients underwent robot- assisted repair (21 umbilical, 14 epigastric, 4 incisional), and 33 patients laparoscopic repair (27 umbilical, 6 epigastric). Seven had recurrent hernias (robot: 4, laparoscopic: 3). There were no significant differences in preoperative characteristics between the two groups. Average operative time was 156 min for robot-assisted repair and 65 min for laparoscopic repair (p < 0.0001). The average defect size was significantly larger for the robot group [3.07 cm (1-9 cm)] than that for the laparoscopic group [2.02 cm (0.5-5 cm)] (p < 0.0001), although there was no significant difference in the average size of mesh used (13 vs. 13 cm). There was no difference in patients requiring postoperative admission or length of stay between the two groups. The mean duration of follow-up was 47 days. There was no difference in complication rate during this time, and no recurrences were reported.

The malignant transformation of a pigmented hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) with beta-Catenin activation is a possible cause for appearance of HCC. PRESENTATION OF CASE We present the case of a 33-year-old male with a huge HCC with bone metastasis, emerged from pigmented HCA with beta-Catenin activation. As a two-stage surgical procedure, a left hepatectomy followed by a partial rib resection was performed. DISCUSSION Giant hepatocellular carcinomas mostly develop in non-cirrhotic livers and at time of diagnosis an extrahepatic spread occurs in up to 15%. In the present case, the progression from a benign HCA to malignant HCC was documented, as a unique finding. Surgical resection is the only curative treatment and was successfully performed in this case. CONCLUSION Hepatobiliary surgery with resection of metastases is the treatment with best long-term survival for patients with huge HCC. Molecular characterization as well as pigmentation analysis is useful tools for risk assessment of HCA.","Lünse, Sebastian; Döring, Paula; Heidecke, Claus-Dieter; Partecke, Lars Ivo",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2017.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28505585/,636
88030,Psychoanalytic Perspectives on Moral Injury in Nurses on the Frontlines of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-09-19,"Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs), such as gene therapies that consist of or contain Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) need to comply with the European Union (EU) GMO legislation, as implemented in each EU Member State, before a clinical trial can commence. Complying with GMO requirements is complex, varies significantly across EU Member States and is leading to delays to clinical trials with ATMPs (see Supplemental materials). Such delays and varying implementation of the GMO legislation makes the EU less attractive as a region to conduct clinical trials with investigational gene therapies. This is detrimental to EU patients, since their timely access to these transformative, potentially curative medicines is delayed. Despite recent initiatives coordinated by the European Commission (EC) to facilitate and reduce discrepancies across the EU regarding the application of the GMO requirements, it remains particularly difficult to conduct multi-centre clinical trials with ATMPs containing or consisting of GMOs involving several EU Member States. The recent decision for the EC to temporarily derogate potential COVID-19 treatments and vaccines from some provisions of the GMO requirements was made on the basis of a clear recognition of such complexities and resulting delays to clinical development. The Alliance for Regenerative Medicine (ARM), the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) and the European Association for Bioindustries (EuropaBio), call upon the EC, together with national competent authorities, to exempt ATMPs containing or consisting of GMOs from the GMO legislation. Such a simplification will eliminate the delays currently reported to occur when submitting environmental risk assessments and GMO applications to the national competent authorities. An exemption from GMO requirements will make the EU a more attractive region for clinical development of gene therapies and could accelerate European patients' access to these potentially life-saving medicines. Maintaining a system for GMO assessment that is different across countries may also prevent ATMPS from realising the full benefits of a harmonised clinical trial approval process under the Clinical Trials Regulation. The undersigned organisations to this publication urge the EC to use its right of initiative to put forward a legislative proposal to exempt ATMPs in clinical development from the EU GMO legislation, within the timeframe proposed in the 2020 EU Pharmaceutical Strategy (by 2022). 1 Implementation of a GMO exemption scheme before the end of the transition period for the Clinical Trial Regulation (the end of 2023) is important to avoid new CTA submissions for ATMPs under the Clinical Trial Regulation having to conduct the whole GMO assessment process in parallel. It is considered that ATMPs such as human somatic cells modified ex vivo, recombinant virus-based vectors, including those containing genome editing nucleic acid sequences, pose negligible risk to the environment. Outside of controlled storage conditions, gene therapies cannot survive for any appreciable length of time. Upon clinical administration, any recombinant gene therapy viral vector particles that do not enter host cells are diluted within the body and if excreted are in such low multiplicity to no longer be viable or considered infectious to persons, animals or living organisms within the environment. Any nucleic acids released into the environment are rapidly degraded.","Beattie, Stuart Gavin",Human gene therapy,https://doi.org/10.1089/hum.2021.058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33843251/,636
88436,COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on dental education: discussing current and future perspectives.,2020,"AIMS The COVID-19 pandemic, and the focus on mitigating its effects, has disrupted diabetes healthcare services worldwide. We aimed to quantify the effect of the pandemic on diabetes diagnosis/management, using glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) as surrogate, across six UK centres. METHODS Using routinely collected laboratory data, we estimated the number of missed HbA1c tests for 'diagnostic'/'screening'/'management' purposes during the COVID-19 impact period (CIP; 23 March 2020 to 30 September 2020). We examined potential impact in terms of: (1) diabetes control in people with diabetes and (2) detection of new diabetes and prediabetes cases. RESULTS In April 2020, HbA1c test numbers fell by ~80%. Overall, across six centres, 369 871 tests were missed during the 6.28 months of the CIP, equivalent to >6.6 million tests nationwide. We identified 79 131 missed 'monitoring' tests in people with diabetes. In those 28 564 people with suboptimal control, this delayed monitoring was associated with a 2-3 mmol/mol HbA1c increase. Overall, 149 455 'screening' and 141 285 'diagnostic' tests were also missed. Across the UK, our findings equate to 1.41 million missed/delayed diabetes monitoring tests (including 0.51 million in people with suboptimal control), 2.67 million screening tests in high-risk groups (0.48 million within the prediabetes range) and 2.52 million tests for diagnosis (0.21 million in the pre-diabetes range; ~70 000 in the diabetes range). CONCLUSIONS Our findings illustrate the widespread collateral impact of implementing measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in people with, or being investigated for, diabetes. For people with diabetes, missed tests will result in further deterioration in diabetes control, especially in those whose HbA1c levels are already high.","Holland, David; Heald, Adrian H; Stedman, Mike; Hanna, Fahmy; Wu, Pensee; Duff, Christopher; Green, Lewis; Robinson, Sarah; Halsall, Ian; Gaskell, Neil; Pemberton, John; Bloor, Christine; Fryer, Anthony A",Journal of clinical pathology,https://doi.org/10.1136/jclinpath-2021-207776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34645702/,636

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is primarily activated to increase blood pressure, but recently potential pro-inflammatory effects of angiotensin II have attracted interest because of the reported association between angiotensin II levels and organ failure and mortality in sepsis. RAAS antagonists could represent a new therapeutic option in this setting. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW The role of RAAS activation in severe sepsis and septic shock, and the potential benefits (and risks) of using RAAS antagonists. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN Insight into RAAS function in severe sepsis and the potential for RAAS inhibitors to be used as an adjunctive therapy in patients with severe sepsis, with discussion of promising results from animal models of sepsis. TAKE HOME MESSAGE Use of RAAS antagonists is an emerging therapeutic option in severe sepsis because these agents may reduce endothelial damage, organ failure, and mortality. However, timing of administration of RAAS antagonists is important because reduced RAAS function may contribute to refractive hypotension later on in septic shock and benefits of RAAS antagonists seem to be restricted to the early phases of sepsis.","Salgado, Diamantino Ribeiro; Rocco, José Rodolfo; Silva, Eliézer; Vincent, Jean-Louis",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,https://doi.org/10.1517/14728220903460332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20001206/,636

Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) monitoring is a noninvasive technology with the purpose of alerting the clinician of peripheral hypoperfusion and the onset of tissue hypoxia. This integrative review examines the rigor and quality of studies focusing on StO2 monitoring in adult critically ill patients. Background. Clinicians must rapidly assess adverse changes in tissue perfusion while minimizing potential complications associated with invasive monitoring. The noninvasive measurement of tissue oxygen saturation is based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), an optical method of illuminating chemical compounds which absorb, reflect, and scatter light directed at that compound. Methods. An integrative review was conducted to develop a context of greater understanding about complex topics. An Integrative review draws on multiple experimental and nonexperimental research methodologies. Results. Fourteen studies were graded at the C category. None reported the use of probability sampling or demonstrated a cause-and-effect relationship between StO2 values and patient outcomes. Conclusions. Future research should be based on rigorous methods of sampling and design in order to enhance the internal and external validity of the findings.","Epstein, Carol Diane; Haghenbeck, Karen Toby",Critical care research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/709683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24900919/,636

METHODS We conducted a systematic review of 17 studies evaluating discontinuation of CPs for MRSA and VRE. Random-effects and fixed-effects models were used to determine the pooled risk ratios of pre incidence hospital-associated infection rate to post incidence rate. Subgroup analysis was used to assess sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS No significant difference between rates of hospital-associated MRSA infection before and after stopping the CPs was observed (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71 - 1.01; p = 0.06). An inverse association was observed between discontinuation of CPs and rates of hospital-associated VRE infection (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 - 0.94; p =0.005). A subgroup analysis of six studies that used chlorhexidine, showed no difference between rates of hospital-associated MRSA infection with discontinuation of CPs (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69 - 1.00; p = 0.05). In five studies that did not use chlorhexidine, there was no difference between rates of hospital-associated MRSA infection with discontinuation of CPs (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.55 - 1.88; p = 0.95). CONCLUSIONS There was no significant difference in rates of hospital-associated MRSA infection before and after removing CPs. Additionally, there were decreased rates of hospital-associated VRE infection following stoppage of CPs.","Kleyman, Robert; Cupril-Nilson, Sophia; Robinson, Kent; Thakore, Shaival; Haq, Furqan; Chen, Liwei; Oyesanmi, Olu; Browning, Kimberly; Pino, Joseph; Mhaskar, Rahul",American journal of infection control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.11.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33276000/,636

Although a common procedure, it is not without significant risk. It is critical for anesthesiologists to consider preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative patient factors and events to optimize safety, especially in young children. In the majority of cases, the indication for adenotonsillectomy in young children is obstructive breathing. Preoperative evaluation for patient comorbidities, especially obstructive sleep apnea, risk factors for a difficult airway, and history of recent illness are crucial to prepare the patient for surgery and develop an anesthetic plan. Communication and collaboration with the otolaryngologist is key to prevent and treat intraoperative events such as airway fires or hemorrhage. Postoperative analgesia planning is critical for safe pain control especially for those patients with a history of obstructive sleep apnea and opioid sensitivity. In young children, it is important to also consider the impact of anesthetic medications on the developing brain. This is an area of continuing research but needs to be weighed when planning for surgical treatment and when discussing risks and benefits with patients' families.","McGuire, Stephanie R; Doyle, Nichole M",World journal of otorhinolaryngology - head and neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wjorl.2021.03.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34430825/,636

The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the factors influencing local tumor progression after percutaneous RFA of hepatic metastases. METHODS Sixty-nine hepatic metastatic lesions in 54 patients were treated by percutaneous RFA. Efficacy was evaluated by contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging at 1 month after ablation, then at 3-month intervals for the first year and biannually thereafter. RESULTS The results of the log-rank test showed that tumor size of <3 cm (p = 0.024) and the absence of tumor contiguous with large vessels (p = 0.002) significantly correlated with local control for hepatic metastases. Cox regression analysis showed that the tumor size <3 cm and the absence of tumor contiguous with large vessels were independent factors (p = 0.055 and 0.009, respectively). The results of the log-rank test showed that neither the threshold post-ablation margin of 1.8 cm (p = 0.064) nor the presence of a tumor with subcapsular location (p = 0.134) correlated with the success of local control. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous RFA is more effective in achieving local control in patients with hepatic metastases when the tumor size is <3 cm and not contiguous with large vessels.","Liu, Chang-Hsien; Yu, Chih-Yung; Chang, Wei-Chou; Dai, Ming-Shen; Hsiao, Cheng-Wen; Chou, Yu-Ching",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-014-3738-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788556/,636

Whilst picornaviruses are known to infect various animals, their existence in dromedaries was unknown. We describe the discovery of a novel picornavirus, dromedary camel enterovirus (DcEV), from dromedaries in Dubai. Among 215 dromedaries, DcEV was detected in faecal samples of four (1.9 %) dromedaries [one (0.5 %) adult dromedary and three (25 %) dromedary calves] by reverse transcription PCR. Analysis of two DcEV genomes showed that DcEV was clustered with other species of the genus Enterovirus and was most closely related to and possessed highest amino acid identities to the species Enterovirus E and Enterovirus F found in cattle. The G+C content of DcEV was 45 mol%, which differed from that of Enterovirus E and Enterovirus F (49-50 mol%) by 4-5 %. Similar to other members of the genus Enterovirus, the 5' UTR of DcEV possessed a putative type I internal ribosome entry site. The low ratios of the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site to the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ka/Ks) of various coding regions suggested that dromedaries are the natural reservoir in which DcEV has been stably evolving. These results suggest that DcEV is a novel species of the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae. Western blot analysis using recombinant DcEV VP1 polypeptide showed a high seroprevalence of 52 % among serum samples from 172 dromedaries for IgG, concurring with its much higher infection rates in dromedary calves than in adults. Further studies are important to understand the pathogenicity, epidemiology and genetic evolution of DcEV in this unique group of animals.","Woo, Patrick C Y; Lau, Susanna K P; Li, Tong; Jose, Shanty; Yip, Cyril C Y; Huang, Yi; Wong, Emily Y M; Fan, Rachel Y Y; Cai, Jian-Piao; Wernery, Ulrich; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.000131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25805410/,636

This multicentre, prospective randomized controlled trial evaluates six videolaryngoscopes in patients with a simulated difficult airway. METHODS With ethics committee approval and written informed consent, 12 senior anaesthetists intubated the trachea of 720 patients. A cervical collar limited mouth opening and neck movement, making intubation difficult. We evaluated three unchannelled (C-MAC™ D-blade, GlideScope™, and McGrath™) and three channelled videolaryngoscopes (Airtraq™, A.P. Advance™ difficult airway blade, and KingVision™). The primary outcome was first-attempt intubation success rate. Secondary outcomes included overall success rate, laryngeal view, intubation times, and side-effects. The primary hypothesis for every videolaryngoscope was that the 95% confidence interval of first-attempt success rate is ≥90%. RESULTS Mouth opening was decreased from 46 (sd 7) to 23 (3) mm with the cervical collar. First-attempt success rates were 98% (McGrath™), 95% (C-MAC™ D-blade), 87% (KingVision™), 85% (GlideScope™ and Airtraq™), and 37% (A.P. Advance™, P<0.01). The 95% confidence interval of first-attempt success rate was >90% only for the McGrath™. Overall success, laryngeal view, and intubation times differed significantly between videolaryngoscopes (all P<0.01). Side-effects were minor. CONCLUSIONS This trial revealed differences in the performance of six videolaryngoscopes in 720 patients with restricted neck movement and limited mouth opening. In this setting, first-attempt success rates were 85-98%, except for the A.P. Advance™ difficult airway blade. Highest success and lowest tissue trauma rates were achieved by the McGrath™ and C-MAC™ D-blade, highlighting the importance of the videolaryngoscope blade design.

These firms were pressed to take immediate action to protect their employees' safety and financial well-being. However, firms varied considerably in the degree to which they took action, and stakeholders appeared to take notice. Leveraging attribution theory, we build theory around the impact of firm actions to protect employee safety and compensation on stakeholder sentiment toward the firm. We further examined how firm leadership helped shape stakeholder sentiment by theorizing about the joint impact of actions with Chief Executive Officer (CEO) benevolence. We built a unique, multisourced data set and tested our theory on a sample of public firms in the consumer staples sector. Our longitudinal analysis of positive stakeholder sentiment expressed on social media demonstrated the importance of these immediate firm actions on sentiment in the initial months of the pandemic. Specifically, firm compensation actions were associated with a growth in positive sentiment over these months, particularly when made by CEOs with high benevolence, whereas firm safety actions led to growth in positive sentiment but only when made by CEOs with low benevolence. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of firm actions and leadership at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

96759,"Physical activity, screen time and the COVID-19 school closures in Europe - an observational study in 10 countries.",2021-02-27,"Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are localized expansions of the abdominal aorta that develop due to chronic proteolytic disruption of the structural extracellular matrix (ECM) components (elastin and collagen) within the aorta wall. Major limitations in arresting or reversing AAAs lie in naturally poor and aberrant regeneration and repair of elastic matrix structures in the aorta wall. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have emerged as a promising regenerative tool and their therapeutic effects are also known to be effected through their paracrine secretions. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) present in these secretions have emerged as critical cellular component in facilitating many therapeutic benefits of MSCs. EV treatment is thus potentially appealing as a stem cell-inspired cell-free approach to avoid possible phenotypic plasticity of MSCs in vivo. In this study, we investigated the thus far unknown effects of BM-MSC derived EVs on vascular elastic matrix repair in the context of AAA treatment. EVs isolated from BM-MSC source were characterized and their pro-regenerative and their anti-proteolytic effects were evaluated on our established in vitro experimental conditions derived from AAA rat model. Our studies revealed the efficacy of BM-MSC derived EVs in attenuating the proteolytic activity and also in imparting elastic matrix regenerative benefits under aneurysmal environment. Interestingly, compared to cell culture conditioned media (CCM), EVs demonstrated superior regenerative and anti-proteolytic benefits in a proteolytic injury culture model of AAA. From these studies, it appears that EVs derived from BM-MSCs could be beneficial in undertaking a reparative effort in AAA induced degeneration of vascular tissue. Statement of Significance Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are localized, rupture-prone expansions of the aorta which result from loss of wall flexibility due to enzymatic breakdown of elastic fibers. There are no established alternatives to surgery, which possess high risk for the mostly elderly patients. Our previous studies have established the elastic regenerative and reparative effect of cell culture secretions derived from adult stem cell source. In this study, we propose to isolate extracellular vesicles (exosomes) from these secretions and evaluate their regenerative benefits in AAA smooth muscle cell culture model. This simple and innovative treatment approach has the potential to arrest or reverse AAA growth to rupture, not possible so far.","Sajeesh, S; Broekelman, Thomas; Mecham, Robert P; Ramamurthi, Anand",Acta biomaterialia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2020.07.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645438/,636

It is a safe, effective, and evidence-based therapy that is performed with general anesthesia. Muscle relaxation is used to prevent injuries related to the tonic-clonic seizure caused by ECT. Hypnotics are administered to induce amnesia and unconsciousness, so that, patients do not experience the period of muscle relaxation, while the generalized seizure is left unnoticed. For the anesthesiologist, ECT is associated with the challenges and pitfalls that are related to informed consent, social acceptance of ECT, airway management (especially in COVID-19 patients), and the interaction between ventilation and anesthetics from one viewpoint, and seizure induction and maintenance from another. The exact mode of action of the therapy is as unknown as the optimal choice or combination of anesthetics used.","Soehle, Martin; Bochem, Janina; Kayser, Sarah; Weyerhäuser, Jan; Valero, Ricard",Best practice & research.

99789,The Evolving COVID-19 Pandemic: An Update.,2020-05-01,"The effect of adding the chokeberry fruit additive to rape honey was studied with regard to the physicochemical properties and biological activity. Two samples of dried powdered fruits were used to enrich the honey (1 and 4% v/v) during creaming. The obtained products were characterized in terms of sugar content, acidity, conductivity, total phenolic, flavonoid and anthocyanin contents and HPTLC polyphenol profiles. The antioxidant properties of enriched honeys were studied in vitro (FRAP, DPPH, and ABTS) and in vivo using a S. cerevisiae model. The inhibitory effect against 5 bacterial strains and coronavirus surrogate bacteriophage phi6 was tested. The addition of chokeberry significantly modified the physicochemical properties of honey and enhanced its antioxidant potential (from 3 to 15 times). Using HPTLC analysis, the occurrence of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and anthocyanins in chokeberry enriched honey was determined. The modified honey protected yeast cells against H2O2-induced oxidative stress when used as a pretreatment agent. All tested bacteria were susceptible to enriched honey in a dose-dependent manner. The antiviral potential of enriched honey against the model bacteriophage was discovered for the first time. In terms of numerous health benefits determined, honey enriched with Aronia melanocarpa fruits can be considered as an interesting novel functional food, which may increase the consumption of chokeberry superfruits.","Miłek, Michał; Grabek-Lejko, Dorota; Stępień, Karolina; Sidor, Ewelina; Mołoń, Mateusz; Dżugan, Małgorzata",Food & function,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1fo02248b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34606549/,636

101228,"Letter in response to 'The good, the bad and the ugly of children´s screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic'.",2021-09-12,"BACKGROUND The rising interest towards minimally invasive surgery has led to the introduction of laparo-endoscopic single site (LESS) surgery as the natural evolution of conventional multiport laparoscopy. However, this new surgical approach is hampered with peculiar technical difficulties. The SPIDER surgical system has been developed in the attempt to overcome some of these challenges. Our study aimed to compare standard laparoscopy and SPIDER technical performance on a surgical simulator, using standardized tasks from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS). METHODS Twenty participants were divided into two groups based on their surgical laparoscopic experience: 10 PGY1 residents were included in the inexperienced group and 10 laparoscopists in the experienced group. Participants performed the FLS pegboard transfers task and pattern cutting task on a laparoscopic box trainer. Objective task scores and subjective questionnaire rating scales were used to compare conventional laparoscopy and SPIDER surgical system. RESULTS Both groups performed significantly better in the FLS scores on the standard laparoscopic simulator compared to the SPIDER. Inexperienced group: Task 1 scores (median 252.5 vs. 228.5; p = 0.007); Task 2 scores (median 270.5 vs. 219.0; p = 0.005). Experienced group: Task 1 scores (median 411.5 vs. 309.5; p = 0.005); Task 2 scores (median 418.0 vs. 331.5; p = 0.007). Same aspects were highlighted for the subjective evaluations, except for the inexperienced surgeons who found both devices equivalent in terms of ease of use only in the peg transfer task. CONCLUSIONS Even though the SPIDER is an innovative and promising device, our study proved that it is more challenging than conventional laparoscopy in a population with different degrees of surgical experience. We presume that a possible way to overcome such challenges could be the development of tailored training programs through simulation methods. This may represent an effective way to deliver training, achieve mastery and skills and prepare surgeons for their future clinical experience.","Giannotti, Domenico; Casella, Giovanni; Patrizi, Gregorio; Di Rocco, Giorgio; Castagneto-Gissey, Lidia; Metere, Alessio; Bernieri, Maria Giulia; Vestri, Anna Rita; Redler, Adriano",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-015-0038-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25935155/,636

101745,"Anticipated emotional and behavioral responses to ambiguous rejection by a significant other, friend, or acquaintance.",2020-07-25,"Tetraspanins are four-span transmembrane proteins that organize the membrane by forming tetraspanin-enriched microdomains. These have been shown to be important for virus entry. The human herpesvirus (HHV)-6A receptor CD46 is known to form complexes with the tetraspanin CD9 and β1-integrins, however the significance of this for HHV-6A infection remains unexplored. Using a genetic approach, we demonstrate that knock out of CD46 abolishes binding to and infection of SupT1 cells by both HHV-6A and HHV-6B, establishing CD46 as a necessary receptor for productive infection of these cells. Knock out of CD9 in SupT1 cells had no effect on binding of either virus to the cell surface, but it reduced expression of immediate early transcripts to between 25-60% compared with the wild type cells. Although HHV-6B required CD46 for infection of SupT1, infection of Molt3 cells was independent of CD46 expression. Conversely, the absence of CD9 expression promoted infection of Molt3 cells with HHV-6B, indicating a negative role of CD9 for CD46-independent infection. Taken together, these data demonstrate that CD9 modulates infection with HHV-6A/B by promoting CD46-dependent infection and impairing CD46-independent infection. This also suggests that HHV-6A is strictly dependent on CD46 for entry, although other proteins, like CD9, may enhance the infection, whereas HHV-6B is more promiscuous and may use CD134, as demonstrated by others, CD46 in SupT1, and a novel yet unidentified receptor in Molt3 cells.Importance The mechanisms of entry of human herpesvirus (HHV)-6A and HHV-6B into host cells are of significance in order to develop novel drugs that may inhibit infection. To elucidate the contribution of the membrane proteins CD9 and CD46, we employed a genetic approach that eliminated these molecules from the host cell. This demonstrated that CD46 is critical for infection by HHV-6A, whereas infection by HHV-6B appeared to be more promiscuous. The infection of a T-cell line in the absence of CD46 and CD134 strongly suggest that an additional receptor for HHV-6B entry exists. Moreover, elimination of CD9 and subsequent reconstitution experiments demonstrated that CD9 promoted infection with HHV-6A and HHV-6B mediated by CD46, but inhibited infection with HHV-6B that occurred independent of CD46. Together, this demonstrated a CD46-dependent role of CD9 during infection with HHV-6A and HHV-6B and emphasized that HHV-6B may employ different entry mechanisms in various cells.","Schack, Vivien R; Rossen, Litten Sørensen; Ekebjærg, Clara Christina; Thuesen, Katrine Kyd Holstein; Bundgaard, Bettina; Höllsberg, Per",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02259-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33504606/,636

The main objective of this study was to assess the safety of transluminal abdominal wall hernia repair for potential human application by specifically investigating the feasibility and challenges of using a transvaginal approach. DESIGN NOTES ventral hernia repair via a transvaginal approach. SETTING University Hospital (National University Health System, Singapore). PARTICIPANTS The study utilized five female pigs (30-40 kg) between 5 and 7 months of age, which underwent abdominal wall hernia repair using a transvaginal approach. INTERVENTION The procedures were performed using a double-channel endoscope under general endotracheal anesthesia. A mesh was placed and fixed to the abdominal wall using standard laparoscopic and endoscopic equipment. The animals survived for 2 weeks and were then euthanized and a necropsy performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES To assess the safety and feasibility of NOTES ventral hernia repair in a survival experimental model. RESULTS All of the procedures could be safely performed using the standard equipment. At the necropsy, all meshes were well in place and mild adhesions were recorded in one animal with a small abscess in the subcutaneous area. CONCLUSION This novel approach seems technically challenging but feasible using equipment and accessories currently available for conventional laparoscopic and interventional endoscopy with low intra-abdominal contamination and sepsis. New procedure-specific instruments and equipment need to be developed to allow the surgeon safer access and more degrees of instrument freedom.","Lomanto, D; Dhir, U; So, J B Y; Cheah, W K; Moe, M A; Ho, K Y",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-009-0485-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19242774/,636

Previous studies have indicated that COVID-19 patients with diabetes are prone to having poor clinical outcomes. AIM To systematically evaluate the prevalence of diabetes among COVID-19 patients in China and its impact on clinical outcomes, including ICU admission, progression to severe cases, or death. METHODS We searched studies published in PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE from December 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020 to identify relevant observational study that investigated the prevalence of diabetes among COVID-19 patients or its impact on clinical outcomes. We used a random-effects or fixed-effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence of diabetes and risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) of diabetes on outcomes. Funnel plots were used to evaluate the publication bias and the heterogeneity was evaluated by I 2 statistic. RESULTS Twenty-three eligible articles including 49564 COVID-19 patients (1573 with and 47991 without diabetes) were finally included. The pooled prevalence of diabetes was 10% (95%CI: 7%-15%) in COVID-19 patients. In the subgroup analyses, the pooled prevalence of diabetes was higher in studies with patients aged > 50 years (13%; 95%CI: 11%-16%) than in studies with patients aged ≤ 50 years (7%; 95%CI: 6%-8%), in severe patients (17%; 95%CI: 14%-20%) than in non-severe patients (6%; 95%CI: 5%-8%), and in dead patients (30%; 95%CI: 13%-46%) than in survivors (8%; 95%CI: 2%-15%) (P < 0.05 for all). Compared with patients without diabetes, the risk of severe cases was higher (RR = 2.13, 95%CI: 1.76-2.56, I 2 = 49%) in COVID-19 patients with diabetes. The risk of death was also higher in COVID-19 patients with diabetes (RR = 3.16, 95%CI: 2.64-3.78, I 2 = 34%). However, diabetes was not found to be significantly associated with admission to ICU (RR = 1.16, 95%CI: 0.15-9.11). CONCLUSION Nearly one in ten COVID-19 patients have diabetes in China. Diabetes is associated with a higher risk of severe illness and death.

DESIGN this is a retrospective/prospective observational hospital cohort. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS the study population includes all patients consecutively admitted to the emergency department of Città della salute e della scienza University Hospital from 01.03 to 31.05.2020 with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES patients were classified in two groups according to the findings of X-ray imaging, lung ultrasound and chest computer tomography, as pneumonia or not pneumonia patients. RESULTS in multivariable analysis, factors most strongly associated with emergency department admission with pneumonia were age, oxygen saturation <90% (adj OR 4.16 ;95%CI 1.44-12.07), respiratory rate >24 breaths/min (adj OR 6.50; 95%CI 2.36-17.87), fever ≥38° (adj OR 3.05; 95%CI 1.53-6.08) and the presence of gastroenteric symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea). A delay (> 7 days) between the appearance of the initial lung symptoms (cough and dyspnea) and the admission to the emergency department was also related to a higher probability of receiving a positive imaging report (OR 4.99; 95%CI 2,02-12,34). CONCLUSIONS in order to reorganize the management of COVID-19 patients in Italy, in view of the risk of a second wave of epidemic or of local outbreaks, it would be desirable to relocate the triage, and possibly the patient's care, from hospital to home. In this scenario it is important to identify all symptoms and signs associated with COVID-19 pneumonia that would facilitate the decision-making process of GPs leading to patients hospitalization.","Sacerdote, Carlotta; Castiglione, Anna; Pagano, Eva; Migliore, Enrica; Pivetta, Emanuele; Auzzas, Grazia Maria; Brenstisci, Carol; Brunetti, Francesco; Dafilé, Corina; Gangemi, Manuela; Giacometti, Lisa; Gilardetti, Marco; Martinis, Vitor Hugo; Saccona, Fabio; Stura, Antonella; Turco, Danila; Balestro, Cristina; Zozzoli, Susanna; Filandra, Umberto; Roggero, Stefano; Silvestre, Carlo; Scozzari, Gitana; Scaramozzino, Antonio; Ciccone, Giovannino",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,https://doi.org/10.19191/ep20.5-6.s2.121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412813/,636
104862,Approaches to Studying Determinants of Racial-Ethnic Disparities in Stroke and Its Sequelae.,2020-11-01,"OBJECTIVES To provide a series of recommendations based on the best available evidence to guide clinicians providing nursing care to patients with severe sepsis. DESIGN Modified Delphi method involving international experts and key individuals in subgroup work and electronic-based discussion among the entire group to achieve consensus. METHODS We used the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines as a framework to inform the structure and content of these guidelines. We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to rate the quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations, with grade 1 indicating clear benefit in the septic population and grade 2 indicating less confidence in the benefits in the septic population. In areas without complete agreement between all authors, a process of electronic discussion of all evidence was undertaken until consensus was reached. This process was conducted independently of any funding. RESULTS Sixty-three recommendations relating to the nursing care of severe sepsis patients are made. Prevention recommendations relate to education, accountability, surveillance of nosocomial infections, hand hygiene, and prevention of respiratory, central line-related, surgical site, and urinary tract infections, whereas infection management recommendations related to both control of the infection source and transmission-based precautions. Recommendations related to initial resuscitation include improved recognition of the deteriorating patient, diagnosis of severe sepsis, seeking further assistance, and initiating early resuscitation measures. Important elements of hemodynamic support relate to improving both tissue oxygenation and macrocirculation. Recommendations related to supportive nursing care incorporate aspects of nutrition, mouth and eye care, and pressure ulcer prevention and management. Pediatric recommendations relate to the use of antibiotics, steroids, vasopressors and inotropes, fluid resuscitation, sedation and analgesia, and the role of therapeutic end points. CONCLUSION Consensus was reached regarding many aspects of nursing care of the severe sepsis patient.

This relative local ischaemia might explain pathogenesis of anal fissure, which is often located posteriorly. The aim of this study was to record the exact position of the distal branches of the superior rectal artery during Doppler-guided haemorrhoidal artery ligation-rectoanal repair (HAL-RAR) procedures with special reference to posterior distribution of the arteries. METHODS All consecutive patients with symptomatic haemorrhoids who were treated with the HAL-RAR procedure between February 2008 and February 2014 in a single institution were included in the study. Number and position of Doppler-guided ligations were prospectively collected. Pearson's chi-squared test was used to compare artery locations. RESULTS A total of 150 patients (75 women) with symptomatic haemorrhoids were included in the study. Median age was 53 years (range 23-83). A median of 10 ligations were placed per patient (range 3-18). A significantly lower number of cumulative arterial ligations was recorded in the posterior position (88 ligations overall, P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS The number of distal branches of the superior rectal artery that have been localized by the Doppler-guided HAL-RAR technique is lower at the posterior midline than in the other segments of the lower rectum. This is another evidence of the vascular deficiency at the posterior pole of the anal canal that might explain the pathogenesis of the anal fissure.","Trilling, Bertrand; Mancini, Adrian; Reche, Fabian; Pflieger, Hannah; Sage, Pierre-Yves; Faucheron, Jean-Luc",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.15143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31264350/,636
108373,Community Use Of Face Masks And COVID-19: Evidence From A Natural Experiment Of State Mandates In The US.,2020-06-16,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection, accompanied with severe or fatal pneumonia like symptoms and sometime death. It has posed to be an ongoing global health emergency caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to a sudden outbreak and a large number of infections and deaths, it became a major concern all over the world. The options available as effective therapeutic, should be urgently exercised to handle this pandemic disease. So far, no specific and accurate anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment is recommended because of the absence of sufficient clinical evidence. In such cases, the clinical use of available drugs is always considered to be on top priority. A broad-spectrum antiviral agent, Remdesivir is found effective in many cases and recommended by many clinicians in many countries. This drug acts as a potential inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein, and thus likely to be efficacious in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Tocilizumab is currently recommended by many hospitals as an alternative treatment for critically ill COVID-19 patients. The tocilizumab has been administered to control cytokine storms that occurred due to the release of proinflammatory cytokine including interleukin 6. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were also used in hospitals, to handle severe COVID-19 patients. Currently, plasma therapy has been exercised as a therapeutic alternative, especially to handle severe COVID-19 patients. In addition, herbal medicines are expected to play significant role in the control and prevention of COVID-19. All these therapeutic options have their advantages and limitations. This review highlights the therapeutic potential of these available drugs, along with their mechanism of action and shortcomings. We have provided detailed information on available therapeutic options, which have proved to be effectual in improving clinical symptoms of severe COVID-19 patients.","Fatima, Urooj; Rizvi, Syed Saif Abbas; Raina, Neha; Fatima, Saher; Rahman, Safikur; Kamal, Mohammad Amjad; Hassan, Md Imtaiyaz",Current pharmaceutical design,https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612826666201125112719; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33238869/,636

METHODS In this multicenter, randomized trial, we compared preoperative biliary drainage with surgery alone for patients with cancer of the pancreatic head. Patients with obstructive jaundice and a bilirubin level of 40 to 250 micromol per liter (2.3 to 14.6 mg per deciliter) were randomly assigned to undergo either preoperative biliary drainage for 4 to 6 weeks, followed by surgery, or surgery alone within 1 week after diagnosis. Preoperative biliary drainage was attempted primarily with the placement of an endoprosthesis by means of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The primary outcome was the rate of serious complications within 120 days after randomization. RESULTS We enrolled 202 patients; 96 were assigned to undergo early surgery and 106 to undergo preoperative biliary drainage; 6 patients were excluded from the analysis. The rates of serious complications were 39% (37 patients) in the early-surgery group and 74% (75 patients) in the biliary-drainage group (relative risk in the early-surgery group, 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.71; P<0.001). Preoperative biliary drainage was successful in 96 patients (94%) after one or more attempts, with complications in 47 patients (46%). Surgery-related complications occurred in 35 patients (37%) in the early-surgery group and in 48 patients (47%) in the biliary-drainage group (relative risk, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.11; P=0.14). Mortality and the length of hospital stay did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Routine preoperative biliary drainage in patients undergoing surgery for cancer of the pancreatic head increases the rate of complications.

109493,Predicting mask-wearing behavior intention among international students during COVID-19 based on the theory of planned behavior.,2021-02-11,"BACKGROUND Since, December 2019 a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has caused global public health issue after being reported for the first time in Wuhan province of China. So far, there have been approximately 14.8 million confirmed cases and 0.614 million deaths due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection globally, and still numbers are increasing. Although, the virus has caused a global public health concern, no effective treatment has been developed. OBJECTIVE One of the strategies to combat the COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is development of vaccines that can make humans immune to these infections. Considering this approach, in this study an attempt has been made to design epitope based vaccine for combatting COVID-19 disease by analyzing the complete proteome of the virus by using immuno-informatics tools. METHODS The protein sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 was retrieved and the individual proteins were checked for their allergic potential. Then, from non-allergen proteins antigenic epitopes were identified that could bind with MHCII molecules. The epitopes were modeled and docked to predict the interaction with MHCII molecules. The stability of the epitopeMHCII complex was further analyzed by performing molecular dynamic simulation study. The selected vaccine candidates were also analyzed for their global population coverage and conservancy among SARS related coronavirus species. RESULTS The study has predicted 5 peptide molecules that can act as potential candidate for epitope based vaccine development. Among the 5 selected epitopes, the peptide LRARSVSPK can be the most potent epitope because of its high geometric shape complementarity score, low ACE and very high response to it by the world population (81.81% global population coverage). Further, molecular dynamic simulation analysis indicated the formation of stable epitope-MHCII complex. The epitope LRARSVSPK was also found to be highly conserved among the SARS-CoV-2 isolated from different countries. CONCLUSION The study has predicted T-cell epitopes that can elicit robust immune response in global human population and act as potential vaccine candidates. However, the ability of these epitopes to act as vaccine candidate needs to be validated in wet lab studies.","Akhtar, Nahid; Joshi, Amit; Singh, Bhupender; Kaushik, Vikas",Infectious disorders drug targets,https://doi.org/10.2174/1871526520666200921154149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32957905/,636

However, the receptor mediating this cell membrane-initiated rapid signaling remains unknown. This study found a putative androgen receptor splice variant in a dopaminergic N27 cell line and in several brain regions (substantia nigra pars compacta, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus) from gonadally intact and gonadectomized (young and middle-aged) male rats. This putative splice variant protein has a molecular weight of 45 kDa and lacks an N-terminal domain, indicating it is homologous to the human AR45 splice variant. Interestingly, AR45 was highly expressed in all brain regions examined. In dopaminergic neurons, AR45 is localized to plasma membrane lipid rafts, a microdomain involved in cellular signaling. Further, AR45 protein interacts with membrane-associated G proteins Gαq and Gαo. Neither age nor hormone levels altered AR45 expression in dopaminergic neurons. These results provide the first evidence of AR45 protein expression in the brain, specifically plasma membrane lipid rafts. AR45 presence in lipid rafts indicates that it may function as a membrane androgen receptor to mediate fast, nongenomic androgen actions.","Garza-Contreras, Jo; Duong, Phong; Snyder, Brina D; Schreihofer, Derek A; Cunningham, Rebecca L",eNeuro,https://doi.org/10.1523/eneuro.0109-17.2017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28856243/,636

METHODS A total of 2030 patients with PLC who underwent PTA were included between April 2009 and December 2018. The patients were grouped into a training dataset (n = 1024) and an external validation dataset (n = 1006). Baseline characteristics were collected to identify the risk factors of seeding after PTA. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model based on the risk factors was used to develop the nomogram, which was used for assessment for its predictive accuracy using mainly the Harrell's C-index and receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS The median follow-up time was 30.3 months (range, 3.2-115.7 months). The seeding risk was 0.89% per tumor and 1.5% per patient in the training set. The nomogram was developed based on tumor size, subcapsular, α-fetoprotein (AFP), and international normalized ratio (INR). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year cumulative seeding rates were 0.1%, 0.7% and 1.2% in the low-risk group, and 1.7%, 6.3% and 6.3% in the high-risk group, respectively, showing significant statistical difference (P < .001). The nomogram had good calibration and discriminatory abilities in the training set, with C-indexes of 0.722 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.661, 0.883) and AUC of 0.850 (95% CI: 0.767, 0.934). External validation with 1000 bootstrapped sample sets showed a good C-index of 0.706 (95% CI: 0.546, 0.866) and AUC of 0.736 (95% CI: 0. 646, 0.827). CONCLUSIONS The clinicopathological-based nomogram could be used to quantify the probability of seeding risk after PTA in PLC.","An, Chao; Huang, Zhimei; Ni, Jiayan; Zuo, Mengxuan; Jiang, Yiquan; Zhang, Tianqi; Huang, Jin-Hua",Cancer medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.3250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32702175/,636

The Derivo® embolisation device (DED) is a new-generation flow diverter designed to treat cerebrovascular aneurysms. The safety and efficacy of flow diverters and their long-term clinical outcome must be investigated. In the present study, the clinical outcomes of using the DED on 182 aneurysms are presented Material and Methods: In total, 146 patients with 182 aneurysms were treated with DED. The mean age of the participants was 51.5 years; among them, 46 (31.5%) presented with acute subarachnoid haemorrhage. The mean aneurysm size was 8.3 mm, and 12 aneurysms were involved the vertebrobasilar system. Ophthalmic aneurysms account for most internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms. RESULTS The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12 patients was 15. DED was associated with a mortality rate of 2.7% and permanent morbidity rate of 3.4%, and a complete aneurysm occlusion rate was achieved in 78.7% of cases after 7.02 months Conclusion: The DED device is a new-generation flow diverter with excellent opening behaviour and navigational benefits.

113469,Lessons from the Belgian experience with regulatory control during the COVID-19 pandemic for the implementation of the European IVD regulation 2017/746.,2020-07-02,"Folate receptor (FR) targeting is an attractive strategy for nuclear imaging of cancer and activated macrophages through application of folic acid radioconjugates. However, significant renal accumulation of folate radioconjugates and hence exceedingly high emission of radiation from the kidneys may mask uptake of radioactivity at sites of interest such as small metastases in the abdominal region of animal models of ovarian cancer. Recently it was observed that the antifolate pemetrexed (PMX) reduces undesired renal uptake of radiofolates. A disadvantage of this strategy is the fact that pemetrexed is a chemotherapeutic agent which may have toxic side effects. The aims of this study were therefore to investigate whether the desired effect of PMX to reduce renal accumulation of folate radioconjugates would be maintained if it was applied as a cocktail together with its antidote, thymidine, and to explore whether thymidine was an effective rescue agent against PMX's related toxicity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro internalization of (67)Ga-EC0800 was investigated using FR-positive KB tumor cells and embryonic monkey MA104 kidney cells in the absence and presence of PMX alone and in combination with thymidine. Uptake of (67)Ga-EC0800 into KB cells was increased by coincubation of the cells with PMX. In contrast uptake of (67)Ga-EC0800 into MA104 cells was reduced under the same conditions. In both cell lines coincubation of thymidine did not change the results obtained with PMX. Biodistribution and SPECT/CT imaging studies of (67)Ga-EC0800 were performed with KB tumor bearing mice injected with PMX alone or with a cocktail of PMX and thymidine. The radiofolate's kidney uptake reducing effect of PMX in mice was maintained also if PMX was employed together with its antidote thymidine. The tumor uptake of (67)Ga-EC0800 remained unchanged independent of the administration of PMX or a combination of PMX and thymidine. The effect of thymidine to abrogate PMX-induced cytotoxicity was demonstrated in vitro with an MTT assay using KB and MA104 cells. Cell viability was reduced to 50% (KB cells) and 70% (MA104 cells) of untreated controls if PMX (5 μM and 15 μM, respectively) was coincubated. Addition of thymidine (10 μM or 100 μM) compensated PMX's toxic effects in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of thymidine was also investigated in non-tumor bearing mice treated with high-dosed PMX. Rescue of mice with side effects after the third and fourth cycles of PMX application (1 mg/mouse) was achieved by application of thymidine (20 mg/mouse) at five consecutive days starting the day of PMX injection. Application of PMX together with thymidine as a cocktail is effective to improve the tissue distribution of radiofolates while preventing pharmacological and potentially toxic side effects of the chemotherapeutic agent PMX. These findings open new perspectives for folate-based nuclear imaging in preclinical research potentially allowing longitudinal investigations and monitoring therapies in animal models of cancer and inflammatory diseases.","Müller, Cristina; Reber, Josefine; Schlup, Claudia; Leamon, Christopher P; Schibli, Roger",Molecular pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.1021/mp300428p; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23394590/,636

There is extensive human evidence for a rise in ANP under acute hypoxic conditions but very little evidence regarding the BNP response to acute hypoxia in humans. We therefore subjected seven healthy subjects to an acute hypobaric hypoxic stimulus to examine if BNP secretion increases rapidly. Significant hypoxaemia (mean nadir oxygen saturation 62.3%) was induced but no significant rise in BNP occurred.

An Analysis of the Hand-Wrist Study Cohort.,2020-11-03,"INTRODUCTION Dark adaptation (DA) has been proposed as a possible functional biomarker for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In this systematic review we aim to evaluate current methodology used to assess DA in people with AMD, the evidence of precision in detecting the onset and progression of AMD, and the relationship between DA and other functional and structural measures. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES were searched for studies published between January 2006 and January 2020 that assessed DA in people with AMD. Details of eligible studies including study design, characteristics of study population and outcomes were recorded. All included studies underwent quality appraisal using approved critical appraisal tools. This systematic review follows PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42019129486). RESULTS Forty-eight studies were eligible for inclusion, reporting a variety of instruments and protocols to assess different DA parameters. Twenty of these studies used the AdaptDx (MacuLogix, Hummelstown, PA, USA) instrument and assessed rod-intercept time (RIT). Most of these reported that RIT was delayed in people with AMD and this delay worsened with AMD severity. Four studies, involving 533 participants, reported estimates of diagnostic performance of AdaptDx to separate people with AMD from visually healthy controls. DA has been compared to other measures of visual function, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and structural measures. Ten studies specifically considered evidence that the presence of certain structural abnormalities was associated with impaired DA in AMD. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review indicates overwhelming evidence of reasonable quality for an association between impaired DA and AMD. Data on the repeatability and reproducibility of DA measurement are sparse. There is evidence that structural abnormalities such as reticular drusen are associated with prolongation of DA time. Fewer studies have explored an association between DA and other measures of visual function or PROMs. We found no studies that had compared DA with performance-based measures.","Higgins, Bethany E; Taylor, Deanna J; Binns, Alison M; Crabb, David P",Ophthalmology and therapy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40123-020-00323-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33565038/,636

Malnutrition increases the risk for the development of enteric and respiratory diseases, but also diarrhea increases the risk for stunting, having a negative effect in height-for-age Z score (HAZ). Therefore, Rotavirus can be considered as one of the contributing factors to stunting. The objective was to determine if vaccination against rotavirus was associated with changes in HAZ of children aged 6-60 months. We analyzed the data of Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 2015-2017 for Peru, which is a nationwide representative. We fitted linear regression models controlling for complex sampling. The vaccine coverage was close to 75.5%, and the mean HAZ was -0.76 standard deviations. After adjusting by demographic, health, and household characteristics, children who received rotavirus vaccine, had a mean HAZ 0.06 standard deviations higher than children who did not receive it. Additionally, BCG vaccination, a higher education level of the mother, a higher wealth index, and treating water for drinking were positively associated with HAZ. On the other hand, we found low birth weight, lack of flush toilet, and altitude higher than 2500 m above sea level negatively associated with HAZ. Rotavirus vaccine is associated with better anthropometric measurements.","Loli, Sebastian; Carcamo, Cesar P",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.10.044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33139135/,636

Here we present results which draw attention to the fact that the reappearance of irrelevant and unattended background contexts of encoding significantly impairs memory discrimination functions. This manuscript presents the results of two experiments in which participants made indoor/outdoor judgements for a large number of object images presented together with individual, irrelevant and presumably unattended background scenes. On a subsequent unexpected recognition test participants saw the incidentally encoded target objects, visually similar lures or new foil objects on the same or new background scenes. Our results showed that although the reappearance of the background scene raised the hit rate for target objects, it decreased mnemonic discrimination, a behavioral score for pattern separation, a hippocampal function that is affected in early dementia. Furthermore, the presence of the encoded background scene at the recognition test increased the false recognition of lure objects, even when participants were explicitly instructed to neglect the context scene. Altogether these results gave evidence that if context increases recognition hits for target memories, it does so at the cost of increasing false recognition and diminished discriminability for similar information.","Racsmány, Mihály; Bencze, Dorottya; Pajkossy, Péter; Szőllősi, Ágnes; Marián, Miklós",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85627-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737589/,636

116444,Sooner than you think: A very early affective reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine in Argentina.,2020-12-28,"INTRODUCTION E-scooter rider injuries have been growing, but little is known about how trip and incident characteristics contribute to their severity. METHOD We enrolled 105 adults injured while riding e-scooters who presented to an emergency department in Washington, DC, during 2019. Enrolled participants completed an interview during the emergency department visit, and their charts were abstracted to document their injuries and treatment. Logistic regression examined the association of incident location and circumstances with the likelihood of sustaining an injury on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) ≥ 2, while controlling for rider characteristics. RESULTS The most common locations of e-scooter injuries in our study sample occurred on the sidewalk (58%) or road (23%). Accounting for other trip and rider attributes, e-scooter riders injured on the road were about twice as likely as those injured elsewhere to sustain AIS ≥ 2 injuries (RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.23-2.36) and those who rode at least weekly more often sustained AIS ≥ 2 injuries compared with less frequent riders (RR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.11-2.32). CONCLUSIONS Greater injury severity for riders injured on the road may reflect higher travel speeds. Practical applications: Injury severity associated with riding in the road is one factor that jurisdictions can consider when setting policy on where e-scooters should be encouraged to ride, but the risk of any crash or fall associated with facilities should also be examined. Although injuries are of lower severity on sidewalks, sharing sidewalks with slower moving pedestrians could potentially lead to more conflicts.","Cicchino, Jessica B; Kulie, Paige E; McCarthy, Melissa L",Journal of safety research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsr.2020.12.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33653557/,636
116673,COVID-19 Pandemic Impact on Cord Blood Collection for Stem Cell Use and Actual Perspectives.,2021-06-01,"We developed a tool that performs longitudinal subtraction of 3D double inversion recovery (DIR) images in follow-up magnetic resonance (MR) examinations of patients with multiple sclerosis. As DIR sequences show a high lesion-to-parenchyma contrast, we hypothesized that such a tool might lead to increased sensitivity for new lesions as well as to speeding up the routine clinical work-up of follow-up MR imaging in multiple sclerosis by directly visualizing new lesions. DIR subtraction images of serial MR examinations were calculated in 106 patients with multiple sclerosis. Existence of new lesions was assessed in three different ways: by standard visual comparison, by FLAIR, and by DIR subtraction maps. A reference standard, to which the single modalities were compared, was defined by combining all information from all readouts and all readers. The presence and number of new lesions were determined and the time needed for analysis measured. Accuracy of detecting overall existence of new lesions using DIR subtraction maps was significantly higher than using visual comparison (96 vs. 86%, p = 0.013) or FLAIR subtraction maps (p < 0.001), with increased sensitivity and higher negative predictive value. Significantly more new lesions were detected when using DIR subtraction maps (p < 0.001). Analyzing subtraction maps took less than a third of the time needed for the standard visual comparison (p = 0.007). Thus, DIR subtraction maps improve the detection of new lesions in a clinical setting both in terms of accuracy and in terms of speed.","Eichinger, Paul; Wiestler, Hanni; Zhang, Haike; Biberacher, Viola; Kirschke, Jan S; Zimmer, Claus; Mühlau, Mark; Wiestler, Benedikt",Journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-017-8576-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28756606/,636

However, realising a circular economy has ran into various biophysical constraints. Circular economy implementation is shaped by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's butterfly diagram that depicts 'biological' and 'technical' flows as separate cycles, subsequently interpreted as organic materials circulating in open loop systems via the environment and inorganic materials circulating in closed loop systems within society. Conversely, in our view, resource flows often contain tightly bound combinations of organic and inorganic materials either due to their natural composition or due to their technical design. Building on this observation, a new diagram is proposed that broadens the scope of the circular economy to cover extractive sectors and the return of materials from anthropogenic use to natural reserves, thereby reshaping the conceptual space within which solutions such as effective zero-waste-residue technologies, business models, and policies can be developed for the optimal management of integrated resources from a whole-system perspective. The diagram offers a realistic outlook on the biophysical limitations of circularity and endeavours to inspire discussion that supports the transition towards a sustainable circular economy.","Velenturf, Anne P M; Archer, Sophie A; Gomes, Helena I; Christgen, Beate; Lag-Brotons, Alfonso J; Purnell, Phil",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31280177/,636

CLINICAL FINDINGS Aural hematomas involved the left (3) or right (2) ears. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME With patients under anesthesia, the aural hematomas were approached surgically from the convex, or lateral, pinnal surface. Two small incisions were used to position a vacuum drain into the incised hematoma cavity. The drain exited at the base of the pinna and adjacent cervical skin. The free end of the drain was attached to a vacuum reservoir for 18 to 21 days. Drains and skin sutures were removed at this time along with the protective Elizabethan collar. All hematomas resolved and surgical sites healed during the minimum 6-month follow-up period. Cosmetic results were considered excellent in 4 of 5 patients. Slight wrinkling of the pinna in 1 patient resulted from asymmetric enlargement of the cartilaginous walls of the hematoma, where vacuum application resulted in a slight folding of the redundant lateral cartilage wall. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The described treatment was efficient, economical, and minimally invasive and required no bandaging or wound care. Placement of the drain tubing on the convex (lateral) aspect sheltered the system from displacement by patients with an Elizabethan collar in place. Overall cosmetic results were excellent; asymmetric enlargement of the cartilaginous walls of the hematoma with slight folding of the pinna was seen in 1 patient.","Pavletic, Michael M",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.246.1.112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25517333/,636
119332,Does high COVID-19 spread impact neighbouring countries? Quasi-experimental evidence from the first year of the pandemic in Ireland.,2021,"The study of type III RNases constitutes an important area in molecular biology. It is known that the pac1+ gene encodes a particular RNase III that shares low amino acid similarity with other genes despite having a double-stranded ribonuclease activity. Bioinformatics methods based on sequence alignment may fail when there is a low amino acidic identity percentage between a query sequence and others with similar functions (remote homologues) or a similar sequence is not recorded in the database. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) applied to protein sequences may allow an alignment-independent prediction of protein function. These sequences of QSAR-like methods often use 1D sequence numerical parameters as the input to seek sequence-function relationships. However, previous 2D representation of sequences may uncover useful higher-order information. In the work described here we calculated for the first time the spectral moments of a Markov matrix (MMM) associated with a 2D-HP-map of a protein sequence. We used MMMs values to characterize numerically 81 sequences of type III RNases and 133 proteins of a control group. We subsequently developed one MMM-QSAR and one classic hidden Markov model (HMM) based on the same data. The MMM-QSAR showed a discrimination power of RNAses from other proteins of 97.35% without using alignment, which is a result as good as for the known HMM techniques. We also report for the first time the isolation of a new Pac1 protein (DQ647826) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe strain 428-4-1. The MMM-QSAR model predicts the new RNase III with the same accuracy as other classical alignment methods. Experimental assay of this protein confirms the predicted activity. The present results suggest that MMM-QSAR models may be used for protein function annotation avoiding sequence alignment with the same accuracy of classic HMM models.","Agüero-Chapín, Guillermín; Gonzalez-Díaz, Humberto; de la Riva, Gustavo; Rodríguez, Edrey; Sanchez-Rodríguez, Aminael; Podda, Gianni; Vazquez-Padrón, Roberto I",Journal of chemical information and modeling,https://doi.org/10.1021/ci7003225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18254616/,636

OBJECTIVE To assess the risk factors associated with mortality in Mexican children with COVID-19. METHOD Secondary analysis of the General Directorate of Epidemiology database. Children younger than 19 years, in whom SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR, were included. RESULTS 1443 children were included. Median age was eight years; 3.3 % were admitted to the intensive care unit, 1.8 % required assisted mechanical ventilation, and mortality was 1.9 %. In multivariate models, the development of pneumonia was the main risk factor for mortality, with an odds ratio (OR) of 6.45 (95 % CI: 1.99, 20.89); patients who required intubation had an OR of 8.75 (95 % CI: 3.23, 23.7).

119830,The novel zoonotic COVID-19 pandemic: An expected global health concern.,2020-03-31,"More than 10 million people are thought to be infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, primarily in the Americas. The clinical manifestations of Chagas' disease (CD) are variable, but most subjects remain asymptomatic for decades. Only 15 to 30% eventually develop terminal complications. All current diagnostic tests have limitations. New approaches are needed for blood bank screening as well as for improved diagnosis and prognosis. Sera from subjects with asymptomatic CD (n = 131) were compared to those from uninfected controls (n = 164) and subjects with other parasitic diseases (n = 140), using protein array mass spectrometry. To identify biomarkers associated with CD, sera were fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography and bound to two commercial ProteinChip array chemistries: WCX2 and IMAC3. Multiple candidate biomarkers were found in CD sera (3 to 75.4 kDa). Algorithms employing 3 to 5 of these biomarkers achieved up to 100% sensitivity and 98% specificity for CD. The biomarkers most useful for diagnosis were identified and validated. These included MIP1 alpha, C3a anaphylatoxin, and unusually truncated forms of fibronectin, apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), and C3. An antipeptide antiserum against the 28.9-kDa C terminus of the fibronectin fragment achieved good specificity (90%) for CD in a Western blot format. We identified full-length ApoA1 (28.1 kDa), the major structural and functional protein component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), as an important negative biomarker for CD, and relatively little full-length ApoA1 was detected in CD sera. This work provides proof of principle that both platform-dependent (i.e., mass spectrometry-based) and platform-independent (i.e., Western blot) tests can be generated using high-throughput mass profiling.","Ndao, Momar; Spithill, Terry W; Caffrey, Rebecca; Li, Hongshan; Podust, Vladimir N; Perichon, Regis; Santamaria, Cynthia; Ache, Alberto; Duncan, Mark; Powell, Malcolm R; Ward, Brian J",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02207-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20071547/,636

The objective was to report on outcome after 2 years of a technique using laparoscopic USL colpopexy. METHODS A total of 152 uterine prolapse patients underwent laparoscopic USL colpopexy from May 2013 to April 2015. We described the surgical technique and performed a retrospective analysis of this laparoscopic technique. Patients underwent standardized assessment and examination using pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) score. The dependent values of Ba point (bladder), C point (vaginal cuff) and Bp point (rectum) were recorded preoperatively, and at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months of postoperative examination. Pre/postoperative data were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS Mean age, operative time and amount of hemorrhage were 68.2 ± 7.5 years, 118.3 ± 36.4 min and 60.5 ± 73.3 mL, respectively. Overall recurrent prolapse, which was defined as POP-Q stage II or higher, was noted in 29 patients (19%). However, only 2 patients presented recurrent rectocele among 51 patients with preoperative POP-Q stage II of uterine prolapse alone (recurrence rate; 3.9%). The pre/postoperative average POP-Q scores were -0.2/-2.7 cm (P < 0.05) at Ba point, -1.9/-5.1 cm (P < 0.05) at C point and -2.4/-2.3 cm (P = 0.06) at Bp point.

METHODS Patient charts and postoperative wound pictures were reviewed for 42 patients who underwent a compression wrap protocol and 50 patients who underwent circumferential casting after primary TAA from 2008 to 2013. A blinded reviewer graded each wound using a novel postoperative wound classification system, and recorded whether the wound was completely healed by or after 3 months. A second blinded review was performed to determine intraobserver reliability. Mean patient age was 55 years (range, 24-80) and all patients had at least 6-month follow-up. RESULTS There were significantly more total wound complications (P = .02) and mild wound complications (P = .02) in the casted group compared to the compression wrap group. There were no significant differences in the number of moderate and severe complications between each group. A significantly higher proportion of TAA incisions took longer than 3 months to heal in the casted group (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS Based on our clinical experience with postoperative wound care after TAA, use of a compression wrap protocol was safe and effective at reducing wound-related complications, and well tolerated by patients.

Network composition may affect priorities, processes, and the reach of health information to key stakeholders. This study seeks to elucidate variation in local network structures to examine how different constellations may affect information sharing across audiences. DESIGN This study analyzes data from a 2016 US survey of 491 metropolitan LHDs and 556 nonmetropolitan LHDs. Researchers first conducted social network analysis of network density, defined as the total number of potential organizations contributing to a jurisdiction's health communication activities. Researchers then conducted logistic regression to compare the relationship between network density and reported health communication activities targeting 3 specific audiences: policy makers, lay publics, and mass media. RESULTS Three network types emerged on the basis of the number of organizations that contribute to health communication activities, with low-density Minimal networks more common in nonmetropolitan jurisdictions and higher-density Expanded and Robust networks more common in metropolitan jurisdictions. LHDs in Minimal networks were significantly less likely to communicate with policy makers, lay publics, and mass media than their counterparts in higher-density networks (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS LHDs are embedded in organizational communication networks that vary in both the number of communication partners and the types of audiences reached. Examining their own local organizational communication networks may provide insights into LHDs that wish to improve the effectiveness of public health messaging. By adding organizational communication partners and reaching new audiences, LHDs in Minimal networks can expand the reach of messages designed to help policy makers, communities, and individuals promote health and prevent disease.","Hoover, Anna Goodman; Zephyr, Pierre Dominique",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001265; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32956298/,636

The aim of this study was to demonstrate a possibility of lymphocytic myocarditis and to study its morphological features in patients with the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) with a severe course.Material and methods Postmortem data were studied for 5 elderly patients (74.8±4.4 years; 3 men and 2 women) with the novel coronavirus infection and bilateral, severe polysegmental pneumonia (stage 3-4 by computed tomography). COVID-19 was diagnosed based on the typical clinical presentation and positive polymerase chain reaction test in nasopharyngeal swabs. All patients were treated in different hospitals repurposed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A standard histological study was performed with hematoxylin and eosin, toluidine blue, and van Gieson staining. Serial paraffin slices were studied immunohistochemically with antibodies to CD3, СD68, CD20, perforin, and toll-like receptors (TLR) 4 and 9.Results In none of the cases, myocarditis was suspected clinically, added to the diagnosis or indicated as a possible cause of death. IHD and acute myocardial infarction were mentioned as error diagnoses not confirmed by the postmortem examination. The morphological examination of the heart identified signs of lymphocytic myocarditis consistent with Dallas criteria for this diagnosis. Myocardial infiltrate was characterized in detail, and a combined inflammatory damage of endocardium and pericardium was described. The immunohistochemical study with cell infiltrate typing confirmed the presence of CD3-positive Т lymphocytes and the increased expression of TLR-4. A picture of coronaritis, including that with microvascular thrombosis, was found in all cases.Conclusion A possibility for development of lymphocytic viral myocarditis in COVID-19 was confirmed morphologically and immunohistochemically.

Reports from healthcare institutions in different countries show a variety of crisis exit strategies. METHODS The following is a review and update of the situation and crisis management in Zürich and Switzerland with a special focus on the impact on the cardiac surgery program and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)-therapy in COVID-19. RESULTS Regional and national measures had avoided the collapse of the health system in Switzerland. There was a reduction of over 50% of the surgical and transcatheter caseload during the first wave of the pandemic. Twenty-three ECMO devices, 150 oxygenators, and more than 300 different cannulas were at our disposal. Between March and May 2020, nine COVID-19 patients were treated by us with ECMO-therapy.

METHOD Socio-demographic and clinical information relating to suicidal and self-harm presentations to EDs in Queensland, Australia, were compared for the period before (March-August 2019) and since the COVID-19 outbreak (March-August 2020). RESULTS Since COVID, Indigenous Australians and persons with less severe suicidal and self-harm presentations had significantly reduced presentations, while persons younger than 18 years had more presentations. Less suicidal presentations resulted in an admission to inpatient care.

As a result, it is associated with chronic disease for millions of Americans. Healthcare systems take responsibility for improving patient health and thus are well positioned to create food security interventions that improve health. Given that dietary recommendations now emphasize plant-based foods (such as vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains), interventions could prioritize distributing plant-based foods that promote health and reduce food insecurity. We developed a plant-based food pantry at the Massachusetts General Hospital Revere Healthcare Center, an academic medical center-affiliated community clinic that serves many patients with food insecurity. We partnered with a local food bank and used a color-coded nutrition ranking system to prioritize healthy foods. What began as a pilot program for patients with food insecurity and chronic disease expanded to serve the entire clinic population in response to rising community level food insecurity resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed and modified a workflow that provided an average of 384 recipients (i.e., patients and their household members) with food monthly during the 10-month study period. A total of 117,742 pounds of food was distributed. Next steps for the food pantry will include investigating health outcomes, assessing patient satisfaction with plant-based foods, and securing sustainable funding. Our experience can be used to guide other health organizations interested in the intersection of food security and chronic disease management.","Mirsky, Jacob B; Zack, Rachel M; Berkowitz, Seth A; Fiechtner, Lauren",Healthcare,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hjdsi.2021.100589; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34628211/,636
128981,"[COVID-19 pandemic: the need to reorganize a Cardiology Department in a hospital of the Lombardy Region, Italy].",2020-05-01,"PURPOSE Fibrin clot is essential for post-operative abdominal adhesion formation. Fucoidans, sulfated polysaccharides, inhibit fibrin clot formation. In addition, they inhibit inflammation and fibrosis, which also play important roles in adhesion formation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate fucoidans' potential for inhibiting post-operative abdominal adhesions and measure their effects on systemic coagulation parameters when administered intraperitoneally (IP). METHODS AND MATERIALS Female Sprague Dawley rats were studied. A 2.5x2.5cm full thickness segment of abdominal wall was excised. The skin edges were approximated. This model induces extensive adhesions and allows objective quantitation. Three fucoidans were evaluated- Sigma Fucoidan Crude (SFC), Fucus vesiculosis 95% (Sigma) and, Peridan. One protocol involved continuous infusion into the abdomen from a subcutaneous osmotic pump. Alternatively, boluses of the solutions were injected IP at the end of the operation. Rats were sacrificed a week later. Adhesion extent was scored. Systemic coagulation effects of fucoidans were also evaluated. INR and aPTT were measured following IP injection of the fucoidan solutions and after 7 days of continuous infusion. RESULTS Animals given a continuous infusion of either SFC or Peridan yielded adhesion reduction of 80 to 90% from control. Bolus Peridan had no discernable influence on adhesion formation, but a single bolus of SFC caused significant adhesion reductions. Peridan resulted in prompt aPTT elevations which fell to nearly normal by 5 hours. The maximum peak value after SFC injection was seen in 15 hours. The maximal INR elevations were around 2. Measurement of INR and aPTT after a week of continuous infusion of either Peridan or SFC, were always in the normal control range. The third agent, Sigma, frequently yielded intraperitoneal infection found at autopsy. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that selected fucoidans infused intraperitoneally for a week after abdominal operations reduce adhesion extent by up to 90%.","Charboneau, Alex J; Delaney, John P; Beilman, Greg",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30462732/,636
129242,How Academic Health Systems Can Move Forward Once COVID-19 Wanes.,2020-05-20,"PURPOSE To evaluate the safety and oncologic efficacy of percutaneous thermal ablation of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and identify risk factors for local tumor progression (LTP). MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective review of an institutional tumor ablation registry demonstrated that 20 patients (9 males, 11 females; mean age 62.5 ± 15.8 years) with 50 ICCs (mean size 1.8 ± 1.3 cm) were treated with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or microwave ablation (MWA) between 2006 and 2015. Thirty-eight of the treated ICCs (76%) were metastases that developed after surgical resection of the primary tumor. Patient demographics, procedure technical parameters, and clinical outcomes were reviewed. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the risk of LTP by ablation modality. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS Mean imaging follow-up time was 41.5 ± 42.7 months. Forty-four (88%) ICCs were treated with RFA, and 6 (12%) with MWA. Eleven (22%) cases of LTP developed in 5 (25%) patients. The median time to LTP among these 11 tumors was 7.1 months (range, 2.3-22.9 months). Risk of LTP was not significantly different for ICCs treated with MWA compared to RFA (HR 2.72; 95% CI 0.58-12.84; p = 03.21). Median disease-free survival was 8.2 months (1.1-70.4 months), and median overall survival was 23.6 months (7.4-122.5 months). No major complication occurred. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous thermal ablation is a safe and effective treatment for patients with ICCs and may be particularly valuable in unresectable patients, or those who have already undergone hepatic surgery. Tumor size and ablation modality were not associated with LTP, whereas primary tumors and superficially located tumors were more likely to subsequently recur.","Takahashi, Edwin A; Kinsman, Kristin A; Schmit, Grant D; Atwell, Thomas D; Schmitz, John J; Welch, Brian T; Callstrom, Matthew R; Geske, Jennifer R; Kurup, A Nicholas",Abdominal radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-018-1656-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29869103/,636
130266,The COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Impact on Dentistry.,2020-06-01,"INTRODUCTION COVID-19 was declared pandemic due to the rapid increase of cases around the world, including the number of pregnant women. Data about vertical transmission of Covid-19 are still limited and controversial: in most cases, although a positive mother, the virus could not be isolated in amniotic fluid, cord blood, breast milk or neonatal throat swab in these patients. No data have been published about possible intrauterine sonographic signs of infection. CASE PRESENTATION A pregnant woman was diagnosed with SARS-CoV2 at 35+5 weeks of gestation and managed conservatively at home. At transabdominal ultrasound at 38+3 weeks, fetal bowel and gallbladder calcifications were noted. CMV and other infectious agents were ruled out; an iterative Caesarean Section was performed at 38+5 weeks without complications. Placenta resulted negative for SARS-CoV-2; the umbilical cord blood sample was IgG positive and IgM negative as per maternal infection. The baby developed respiratory distress syndrome requiring endotracheal surfactant administration and nasal-CPAP for one day but nasopharyngeal swabs at birth and after 48 hours were SARS-Cov2 negative. Neonatal abdominal ultrasound showed normal liver, acalculous gallbladder with mild parietal thickening. The baby was discharged in good conditions. CONCLUSIONS although gallbladder calcifications and echogenic bowel are highly suspicious of viral infection and were thought to be due to the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, these findings were not corroborated by the results of our diagnostic tests; these sonographic findings might represent a false positive of fetal infection in mother affected by COVID-19 since vertical transmission appears to be rare.","Sileo, Filomena G; Tramontano, Anna L; Leone, Chiara; Meacci, Marisa; Gennari, William; Ternelli, Giliana; La Marca, Antonio; Lugli, Licia; Berardi, Alberto; Facchinetti, Fabio; Bertucci, Emma",Minerva ginecologica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0026-4784.20.04717-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33249821/,636

DESIGN Nationwide nested case-control study. SETTINGS South Korea. PARTICIPANTS Psychiatric inpatients. INTERVENTIONS Continuity of psychiatric outpatient care was measured from the time of hospital discharge until readmission or death occurred, using the continuity of care index. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Readmission, all-cause mortality, and suicides within 1-year post-discharge. RESULTS Of 18,702 psychiatric inpatients in the study, 8,022 (42.9%) were readmitted, 355 (1.9%) died, and 108 (0.6%) died by suicide within 1 year after discharge. Compared to the psychiatric inpatients with a high continuity-of-care score, a significant increase in the readmission risk within 1 year after discharge was found in those with medium and low continuity of care scores. An increased risk of all-cause mortality within 1 year after hospital discharge was shown in the patients in the low continuity group, relative to those in the high-continuity group. The risk of suicide within 1 year after hospital discharge was higher in those with medium and low continuity of care than those with high continuity of care. CONCLUSION This study's results provide empirical evidence of the importance of continuity of care when designing policies to improve the quality of mental health care, such as increasing patient awareness of the importance of continuity and implementation of policies to promote continuity.","Choi, Young; Nam, Chung Mo; Lee, Sang Gyu; Park, Sohee; Ryu, Hwang-Gun; Park, Eun-Cheol",International journal for quality in health care : journal of the International Society for Quality in Health Care,https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzaa093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797161/,636

Furthermore, outdoor access has not been quantified in domestic animals as a risk factor with respect to latitude or parasite transmission pathway. Cats are an ideal model to test parasitic infection risk in outdoor animals because there have been many studies analysing this risk factor in this species; and there is a useful dichotomy in cat ownership between indoor-only cats and those with outdoor access. Thus, we used meta-analysis to determine whether outdoor access is a significant risk factor for parasitic infection in domestic pet cats across 19 different pathogens including many relevant to human, domestic animal and wildlife health, such as Toxoplasma gondii and Toxocara cati. Cats with outdoor access were 2.77 times more likely to be infected with parasites than indoor-only cats. Furthermore, absolute latitude trended towards significance such that each degree increase in absolute latitude increased infection likelihood by 4%. Thus, restricting outdoor access can reduce the risk of parasitic infection in cats and reduce the risk of zoonotic parasite transmission, spillover to sympatric wildlife and negative impacts on feline health.","Chalkowski, Kayleigh; Wilson, Alan E; Lepczyk, Christopher A; Zohdy, Sarah",Biology letters,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2018.0840; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30991913/,636
130874,Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Serie A Soccer Players' Physical Qualities.,2021-02-23,"UNLABELLED Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a worldwide-distributed alphacoronavirus, but the pathogenesis of PEDV infection is not fully characterized. During virus infection, type I interferon (IFN) is a key mediator of innate antiviral responses. Most coronaviruses develop some strategy for at least partially circumventing the IFN response by limiting the production of IFN and by delaying the activation of the IFN response. However, the molecular mechanisms by which PEDV antagonizes the antiviral effects of interferon have not been fully characterized. Especially, how PEDV impacts IFN signaling components has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we observed that PEDV was relatively resistant to treatment with type I IFN. Western blot analysis showed that STAT1 expression was markedly reduced in PEDV-infected cells and that this reduction was not due to inhibition of STAT1 transcription. STAT1 downregulation was blocked by a proteasome inhibitor but not by an autophagy inhibitor, strongly implicating the ubiquitin-proteasome targeting degradation system. Since PEDV infection-induced STAT1 degradation was evident in cells pretreated with the general tyrosine kinase inhibitor, we conclude that STAT1 degradation is independent of the IFN signaling pathway. Furthermore, we report that PEDV-induced STAT1 degradation inhibits IFN-α signal transduction pathways. Pharmacological inhibition of STAT1 degradation rescued the ability of the host to suppress virus replication. Collectively, these data show that PEDV is capable of subverting the type I interferon response by inducing STAT1 degradation. IMPORTANCE In this study, we show that PEDV is resistant to the antiviral effect of IFN. The molecular mechanism is the degradation of STAT1 by PEDV infection in a proteasome-dependent manner. This PEDV infection-induced STAT1 degradation contributes to PEDV replication. Our findings reveal a new mechanism evolved by PEDV to circumvent the host antiviral response.","Guo, Longjun; Luo, Xiaolei; Li, Ren; Xu, Yunfei; Zhang, Jian; Ge, Jinying; Bu, Zhigao; Feng, Li; Wang, Yue",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01091-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27384656/,636

Epidemic CoViD-19 reflects the higher risk of infections among inmates and personnel, due to closed proximity, prison overcrowding and structural conditions of Italian prisons. In the world, the higher risk infections among prisoners has been investigated in many studies, showing that, compared with the general public, people in prisons have a higher prevalence of infection such as HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and tuberculosis. This is recognized as a major issue for the health of people in prisons, as well as the general population, because the majority of people who have been incarcerated will subsequently return to their communities. In Italy there are no enough available data to know the sanitary impact of such epidemic, so that preventive measures are extremely urgent.","Camposeragna, Antonella",Recenti progressi in medicina,https://doi.org/10.1701/3366.33407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32448876/,636
133818,First year with COVID-19: Assessment and prospects.,2020-11-26,"Background Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China at the beginning of December 2019, there have been over 11,200,000 confirmed cases in the world as of the 3rd July 2020, affecting over 213 countries and regions with nearly 530,000 deaths. The pandemic has been sweeping all continents, North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and South Asia among others at an alarming rapidity. Here, we provide an estimate of the scale of the pandemic spread under different scenarios of variation in key influencing parameters with a hybrid model. Methods We developed a new hybrid model of infectious disease transmission based on Cellular Automata (CA)-configured SEIR to analyse the COVID-19 outbreak and estimate its transmission pattern. A probabilistic contamination network is embedded in the pandemic transmission model to capture the randomness feature of person-to-person spread of the novel virus. We used the improved SEIR model to quantify the population contact state with isolation measures under different continuous time series contact probability via CA. We adjusted the modelling parameters to verify the model performance in accordance to the data from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. We simulated several scenarios by varying such key parameters as number of isolation rate, average contact times of the population, number of infected people before taking prevention and control measures, medical level and number of imported cases. Results In the baseline model, we identified that the isolation control as the most influencing factor that had the largest impact on decreasing the speed of the reproductive number, accelerating the arrival of the ""inflection point"" of pandemic prevention and control, and the death rate reduction. We estimated that the probability of people contacts and the number of the onset infected cases before prevention measures also had significant effect on the infection rate reduction with appropriate prevention measures adoption, which partly reflects the impact of timely measure on the severity of the outbreak. We found that imported cases will risk the domestic prevention. Conclusions Our modelling results clearly indicate that early-stage preventive measures are the most effective way to contain the pandemic spread and a strong interventionist approach needs to be adopted by policymakers vis-à-vis of the highly contagious nature of the COVID-19. Human resources, intensified isolation and confinement as well as special hospital buildings should be prioritised in countries with large number of infections to constrain the global transmission of the virulent infection. To do so, internationally coordinated actions require to be taken to replicate good practices to less infected countries and regions immediately.","Zhou, Yimin; Li, Jun; Chen, Zuguo; Luo, Qingsong; Wu, Xiangdong; Ye, Lingjian; Ni, Haiyang; Fei, Chunnan",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-20-1315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33209406/,636

However, existing evidence dissemination approaches may be insufficient for promoting the broader application and impact of findings to benefit the health of patients and the public. Health psychology is contributing to the science of implementing research into practice. Behaviour change theory and methods typically directed towards health behaviours are now being used to understand and change the behaviour of individuals at different levels of the health system whose own behaviour impacts the delivery of evidence-based health behaviour change interventions. Despite this contribution to the science of implementation, health psychology is perhaps doing less to draw from implementation science. We propose that a redoubled focus on implementation science in health psychology could provide novel prospects for enhancing the impact of health behaviour change evidence. In this article, we report a journal-specific review of reviews of trials of health behaviour change interventions published in Health Psychology Review from inception to April 2020. We identified 34 reviews and assessed whether implementation readiness of health behaviour change intervention was discussed. We then narratively review ways in which implementation science has integrated theory and methods from health psychology and related disciplines to inform the science of how to improve health care. Finally, we demonstrate how greater synergy between implementation science and health psychology could help promote greater follow-through on advances made in the science of health behaviour change.","Presseau, Justin; Byrne-Davis, Lucie M T; Hotham, Sarah; Lorencatto, Fabiana; Potthoff, Sebastian; Atkinson, Lou; Bull, Eleanor; Dima, Alexandra L; van Dongen, Anne; French, David; Hankonen, Nelli; Hart, Jo; Ten Hoor, Gill; Hudson, Kristian; Kwasnicka, Dominika; van Lieshout, Sanne; McSharry, Jennifer; Olander, Ellinor K; Powell, Rachael; Toomey, Elaine; Byrne, Molly",Health psychology review,https://doi.org/10.1080/17437199.2020.1866638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33446062/,636

The molecular mechanisms involved in the regression of endometriotic tissue, however, remain to be elucidated. In this study, we performed genome-wide gene expression profiling of clinical specimens of ovarian endometrioma to obtain insight into the effects of leuprolide acetate treatment. METHODS We obtained clinical samples from nine normal eutopic endometrium tissues, eight ovarian endometriotic tissues, and 12 leuprolide acetate-treated endometriotic tissues. We compared the gene expression profiles of the three groups using Affymetrix GeneChip Human genome arrays and bioinformatic analysis, including molecular concept analysis. RESULTS Leuprolide acetate-treated endometriotic tissue showed downregulated genes associated with the biological functions of steroid hormone regulation, cell proliferation, inflammation, and intracellular signaling. These genes included PTGDS, GRP, APLP2, PLTP, and FGFRL1. In contrast, genes upregulated by leuprolide acetate treatment were associated with cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. These genes included CARD11 and USP18. CONCLUSIONS These preliminary results based on GeneChip analysis suggest that leuprolide acetate treatment induces a modulation of gene expression that allows for cooperative alterations in disease state. This study gives new insight into the effects of leuprolide acetate treatment. Further investigations with quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry are needed to validate this study and to explore new therapeutic targets and biomarkers of endometriosis.","Kiba, Atsushi; Banno, Kouji; Yanokura, Megumi; Asada, Mari; Nakayama, Yusuke; Aoki, Daisuke; Watanabe, Tatsuya",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,https://doi.org/10.1111/jog.12768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26374406/,636

Restaurants are frequent settings for foodborne illness transmission. Public health surveillance - the continual, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of reports of health data to prevent and control illness - is a prerequisite for an effective food control system. While restaurant inspection data are routinely collected, these data are not regularly aggregated like traditional surveillance data. However, there is evidence that these data are a valuable tool for understanding foodborne illness outbreaks and threats to food safety. This article discusses the challenges and opportunities for incorporating routine restaurant inspection data as a surveillance tool for monitoring and improving foodborne illness prevention activities. The three main challenges are: 1) lack of a national framework; 2) lack of data standards and interoperability; and 3) limited access to restaurant inspection data. Tapping into the power of public health informatics represents an opportunity to address these challenges. Advancing the food safety system by improving restaurant inspection information systems and making restaurant inspection data available to support decision-making represents an opportunity to practice smarter food safety.","Firestone, Melanie J; Rajamani, Sripriya; Hedberg, Craig W",Online journal of public health informatics,https://doi.org/10.5210/ojphi.v13i1.11087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33936525/,636

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to HV-KP is uncommon and details of its clinical and microbiological features are limited. We report the first case of CAP due to capsular genotype K2-ST86 HV-KP in Okinawa, Japan and review infections caused by the K2-ST86 strain. A 79-year-old woman presenting with fever and productive cough persisting for the past three days was admitted to hospital. Her vital signs indicated septic shock. Lung examination by auscultation revealed holo-crackle and lobar pneumonia in chest radiography, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was suspected. However, sputum and blood cultures revealed Gram-negative coccus identified as K. pneumoniae. Genetic analysis identified the isolated strain as the K2 serotype harboring rmpA, iutA, entB, and mrkD. Therefore, we identified the isolated strain as hypervirulent. The isolate belonged to ST86 as determined by multilocus sequence typing. The case was not complicated by predisposing factors such as diabetes mellitus and malignancy related to HV-KP infection; thus, this CAP-causing HV-KP strain may differ from the typical HV-KP strain that induces liver abscess. A literature review identified only nine cases with CAP due to HV-KP. In all cases, the disease mainly occurred in older males with diabetes mellitus, which makes the present case unusual, and had high rates of septic shock and death. No case, including ours, was complicated by metastatic infection, suggesting that CAP due to HV-KP poses little distant metastasis risk, even in patients with bloodstream infection. In our review, consistent with our case, K2-ST86 was the most common strain of HV-KP in patients with CAP. Therefore, studies are needed to elucidate the clinical and microbiological features of HV-KP CAP, with a focus on the K2-ST86 strain.

136925,Year in Review 2020: Noteworthy Literature in Cardiothoracic Critical Care.,2021-05-14,"BACKGROUND Asthma treatment guidelines recommend increasing corticosteroid dose to control symptoms and reduce exacerbations. This approach is potentially flawed because symptomatic asthma can occur without corticosteroid responsive type-2 (T2)-driven eosinophilic inflammation, and inappropriately high-dose corticosteroid treatment might have little therapeutic benefit with increased risk of side-effects. We compared a biomarker strategy to adjust corticosteroid dose using a composite score of T2 biomarkers (fractional exhaled nitric oxide [FENO], blood eosinophils, and serum periostin) with a standardised symptom-risk-based algorithm (control). METHODS We did a single-blind, parallel group, randomised controlled trial in adults (18-80 years of age) with severe asthma (at treatment steps 4 and 5 of the Global Initiative for Asthma) and FENO of less than 45 parts per billion at 12 specialist severe asthma centres across England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Patients were randomly assigned (4:1) to either the biomarker strategy group or the control group by an online electronic case-report form, in blocks of ten, stratified by asthma control and use of rescue systemic steroids in the previous year. Patients were masked to study group allocation throughout the entirety of the study. Patients attended clinic every 8 weeks, with treatment adjustment following automated treatment-group-specific algorithms: those in the biomarker strategy group received a default advisory to maintain treatment and those in the control group had their treatment adjusted according to the steps indicated by the trial algorithm. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with corticosteroid dose reduction at week 48, in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Secondary outcomes were inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose at the end of the study; cumulative dose of ICS during the study; proportion of patients on maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) at study end; rate of protocol-defined severe exacerbations per patient year; time to first severe exacerbation; number of hospital admissions for asthma; changes in lung function, Asthma Control Questionnaire-7 score, Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score, and T2 biomarkers from baseline to week 48; and whether patients declined to progress to OCS. A secondary aim of our study was to establish the proportion of patients with severe asthma in whom T2 biomarkers remained low when corticosteroid therapy was decreased to a minimum ICS dose. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02717689 and has been completed. FINDINGS Patients were recruited from Jan 8, 2016, to July 12, 2018. Of 549 patients assessed, 301 patients were included in the ITT population and were randomly assigned to the biomarker strategy group (n=240) or to the control group (n=61). 28·4% of patients in the biomarker strategy group were on a lower corticosteroid dose at week 48 compared with 18·5% of patients in the control group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·71 [95% CI 0·80-3·63]; p=0·17). In the per-protocol (PP) population (n=121), a significantly greater proportion of patients were on a lower corticosteroid dose at week 48 in the biomarker strategy group (30·7% of patients) compared with the control group (5·0% of patients; aOR 11·48 [95% CI 1·35-97·83]; p=0·026). Patient choice to not follow treatment advice was the principle reason for loss to PP analysis. There was no difference in secondary outcomes between study groups and no loss of asthma control among patients in the biomarker strategy group who reduced their corticosteroid dose. INTERPRETATION Biomarker-based corticosteroid adjustment did not result in a greater proportion of patients reducing corticosteroid dose versus control. Understanding the reasons for patients not following treatment advice in both treatment strategies is an important area for future research. The prevalence of T2 biomarker-low severe asthma was low.

137102,Health status changes with transitory disability over time.,2019,"BACKGROUND Policy changes including the Advancing American Kidney Health initiative and CMS's ESRD Quality Incentive Program recommend increasing educational initiatives within dialysis centers to increase living kidney donor transplant (LDKT) rates. LDKT education can be challenging in dialysis centers due to limited provider time to educate, patient fears or reluctance to learn about LDKT, and difficulty educating potential living donors. New educational innovations that increase dialysis patient curiosity about pursuing LDKT are needed. SUMMARY Digital first-person storytelling, or the sharing of narratives by individuals in their own words, is a culturally competent, health literate, patient-driven approach to expanding patient understanding about LDKT that can supplement traditional educational strategies without additional burden for dialysis providers. The Living Donation Storytelling Project is an online digital library of over 150 video stories told by diverse kidney recipients, donors, those in search of a donor, and their family/friends. By honestly discussing how they overcame fears and challenges related to LDKT, these stories address sensitive topics that can be hard for providers to introduce by using easily accessible learning methodology that may better connect with racial/ethnic minorities, scared patients, and patients facing health literacy challenges. Key Messages: Supplementing traditional educational approaches with digital storytelling may help overcome time limitations in educating for busy providers, boost providers' own knowledge about LDKT, serve as a free supplemental resource for patients, reduce fears and increase self-efficacy about transplant, help more patients to share about transplant with their social networks, and ultimately increase LDKT rates.","Wood, Emily H; Waterman, Amy D; Pines, Rachyl",Blood purification,https://doi.org/10.1159/000512651; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33440381/,636

One option is instrumental assistance (forceps or a vacuum-cup), which, if used with skill and sensitivity, can improve maternal/neonatal outcomes. This review aimed to understand the core competencies and expertise required for skilled use in AVD in conjunction with reviewing potential barriers and facilitators to gaining competency and expertise, from the point of view of maternity care practitioners, funders and policy makers. METHODS A mixed methods systematic review was undertaken in five databases. Inclusion criteria were primary studies reporting views, opinions, perspectives and experiences of the target group in relation to the expertise, training, behaviours and competencies required for optimal AVD, barriers and facilitators to achieving practitioner competencies, and to the implementation of appropriate training. Quality appraisal was carried out on included studies. A mixed-methods convergent synthesis was carried out, and the findings were subjected to GRADE-CERQual assessment of confidence. RESULTS 31 papers, reporting on 27 studies and published 1985-2020 were included. Studies included qualitative designs (3), mixed methods (3), and quantitative surveys (21). The majority (23) were from high-income countries, two from upper-middle income countries, one from a lower-income country: one survey included 111 low-middle countries. Confidence in the 10 statements of findings was mostly low, with one exception (moderate confidence). The review found that AVD competency comprises of inter-related skill sets including non-technical skills (e.g. behaviours), general clinical skills; and specific technical skills associated with particular instrument use. We found that practitioners needed and welcomed additional specific training, where a combination of teaching methods were used, to gain skills and confidence in this field. Clinical mentorship, and observing others confidently using the full range of instruments, was also required, and valued, to develop competency and expertise in AVD. However, concerns regarding poor outcomes and litigation were also raised. CONCLUSION Access to specific AVD training, using a combination of teaching methods. Complements, but does not replace, close clinical mentorship from experts who are positive about AVD, and opportunities to practice emerging AVD skills with supportive supervision. Further research is required to ascertain effective modalities for wider training, education, and supportive supervision for optimal AVD use.","Feeley, Claire; Crossland, Nicola; Betran, Ana Pila; Weeks, Andrew; Downe, Soo; Kingdon, Carol",Reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-021-01146-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33952309/,636

This intensive longitudinal study investigated the initiation and sustainment of adolescents' daily social distancing behaviors. METHODS Focus group and daily-diary approaches were used to collect 6,216 assessments from a nationwide American adolescent sample (n = 444; Mage = 15.1; 40% male; 42% black/African American, 40% white/European American, 10% Latinx, 6% Asian American, 2% Native American) over the course of 14 days at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS When adolescents were motivated by preventing others from getting sick, they were more likely to engage in social distancing (same day: B = .50, SE = .09, 95% confidence interval [CI] [.32, .68] p < .001; next day: B = .49, SE = .09, 95% CI [.31, .67] p < .001). Daily social support from friends (same day: B = .04, SE = .02, 95% CI [.01, .08] p < .05; next day: B = .08, SE = .02, 95% CI [.05, .12] p < .001), connectedness with friends via technology (same day: B = .23, SE = .04, 95% CI [.14, .32] p < .001; next day: B = .12, SE = .05, 95% CI [.03, .21] p < .001), and practical knowledge about ways to prevent contracting and transmitting COVID-19 (same day: B = .12, SE = .02, 95% CI [.08, .17] p < .001; next day: B = .05, SE = .02, 95% CI [.01, .10] p < .05) positively predicted adolescents' same- and next-day engagement in social distancing. CONCLUSIONS Adolescents who were motivated by the desire to protect others were more likely to engage in social distancing. In addition, adolescents who learned about preventative health behaviors for mitigating COVID-19, received peer support, and remained virtually connected with friends were more likely to engage in daily social distancing at the onset of the pandemic.","Wang, Ming-Te; Scanlon, Christina L; Hua, Meng; Del Toro, Juan",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.03.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33858762/,636

139291,Osteopathic Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-07-13,"BACKGROUND Lungs are the primary organ of involvement of COVID-19, and the severity of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. AIM We aimed to evaluate the visual and quantitative pneumonia severity on chest computed tomography (CT) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and compare the CT findings with clinical and laboratory findings. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated adult COVID-19 patients who underwent chest CT, clinical scores, laboratory findings, and length of hospital stay. Two independent radiologists visually evaluated the pneumonia severity on chest CT (VSQS). Quantitative CT (QCT) assessment was performed using a free DICOM viewer, and the percentage of the well-aerated lung (%WAL), high-attenuation areas (%HAA) at different threshold values, and mean lung attenuation (MLA) values were calculated. The relationship between CT scores and the clinical, laboratory data, and length of hospital stay were evaluated in this cross-sectional study. The student's t-test and chi-square test were used to analyze the differences between variables. The Pearson correlation test analyzed the correlation between variables. The diagnostic performance of the variables was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used. RESULTS The VSQS and QCT scores were significantly correlated with procalcitonin, d-dimer, ferritin, and C-reactive protein levels. Both VSQ and QCT scores were significantly correlated with disease severity (p<0.001). Among the QCT parameters, the %HAA-600 value showed the best correlation with the VSQS (r=730,p<0.001). VSQS and QCT scores had high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing disease severity and predicting prolonged hospitalization. CONCLUSION The VSQS and QCT scores can help manage the COVID-19 and predict the duration of hospitalization.","Kaya, Furkan; Konya, Petek Şarlak; Demirel, Emin; Demirtürk, Neşe; Orhan, Semiha; Ufuk, Furkan",Current medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.2174/1573405617666210215142528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33588737/,636

Most of these studies focused on specific aneurysms or a certain WEB device. Our objective was to report the experience of 2 German centers with the WEB device, including technical feasibility, safety, and short-term angiographic outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective study of all ruptured and unruptured aneurysms that were treated with a WEB device (WEB Double-Layer, Single-Layer, and Single-Layer Sphere) between April 2012 and August 2014. Primary outcome measures included the feasibility of the implantation and the angiographic outcome at 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures included the clinical outcome at discharge and procedural complications. RESULTS Fifty-five aneurysms in 52 patients, including 14 ruptured aneurysms, underwent treatment with the WEB device. The median age of patients was 55 years (range, 30-75 years); 19/55 (37%) were men. The device could be deployed in all patients and was implanted in 51/55 (93%) cases. Procedural complications occurred in 6/51 (12%), comprising 2 thromboembolic events, 2 thrombus formations, 1 high-grade posterior cerebral artery stenosis, and 1 aneurysm rupture. None of these had clinical sequelae. Angiographic follow-up at 3 months was available for 44/51 (86%) aneurysms. A favorable angiographic result at 3 months was achieved in 29/44 (66%) cases, whereas the percentage of good anatomic results increased from 40% in 2012 to 75% in 2014.

Minor histocompatibility antigen (mHAg) peptides mediate alloreactive T cell responses and induce graft-versus-leukaemia responses when expressed on patient haematopoietic tissue. We vaccinated nine HA-1-negative donors against HA-1 with a 'prime-boost' protocol of either two or three DNA 'priming' vaccinations prior to 'boost' with modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA). HA-1-specific CD8+ T cell responses were observed in seven donors with magnitude up to 1·5% of total CD8+ T cell repertoire. HA-1-specific responses peaked two weeks post-MVA challenge and were measurable in most donors after 12 months. HA-1-specific T cells demonstrated strong cytotoxic activity and lysed target cells with endogenous HA-1 protein expression. The pattern of T cell receptor (TCR) usage by HA-1-specific T cells revealed strong conservation of T cell receptor beta variable 7-9 (TRBV7-9) usage between donors. These findings describe one of the strongest primary peptide-specific CD8+ T cell responses yet recorded to a DNA-MVA prime-boost regimen and this may reflect the strong immunogenicity of mHAg peptides. Prime-boost vaccination in donors or patients may prove of substantial benefit in boosting graft-versus-leukaemia responses.","Eldershaw, Suzy A; Pearce, Hayden; Inman, Charlotte F; Piper, Karen P; Abbotts, Ben; Stephens, Christine; Nicol, Samantha; Croft, Wayne; Powell, Richard; Begum, Jusnara; Taylor, Graham; Nunnick, Jane; Walsh, Donna; Sirovica, Mirjana; Saddique, Shamyla; Nagra, Sandeep; Ferguson, Paul; Moss, Paul; Malladi, Ram",British journal of haematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.17495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046897/,636

DESIGN Cross-sectional observational study. SETTINGS Obesity treatment clinic, community and university laboratory. PARTICIPANTS Seventy-three of 133 women aged 25-75 years reported the presence of pain for at least 2 weeks and were categorised according to BMI (normal weight, overweight, obese or morbidly obese). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES BMI and questionnaires [McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Short-Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36) and Baecke Physical Activity Questionnaire]. RESULTS Pain intensity was 3 and 4.5 times higher in the MPQ and BPI, respectively, in morbidly obese women compared with women of normal weight. Morbidly obese women had 10.7 times higher pain interference and lower scores on the SF-36 domains of physical function and role function-physical compared with women of normal weight. Obese and morbidly obese women had less pain relief from treatment. Regression analysis showed that high BMI and low level of physical activity contributed to the intensity of pain, and these variables explained 16% of the variance of pain intensity. CONCLUSIONS This study found that the prevalence and intensity of pain are greater in morbidly obese women than women of normal weight, and pain is negatively associated with physical activity. The causal inter-relationships between pain, obesity and physical activity are complex and require further study.","Pazzianotto-Forti, E M; Sgariboldi, D; Rasera, I; Reid, W D",Physiotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physio.2018.05.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30025716/,636

We aimed to compare the predictive accuracy for re-intubation diagnosed by cough peak flow (CPF) measured by a spirometer and a ventilator. METHODS Endotracheally intubated subjects who passed a spontaneous breathing trial were enrolled. Before extubation, CPF was measured by a spirometer and a ventilator, respectively. Re-intubation was recorded at 72 h after extubation. RESULTS A total of 126 subjects were enrolled. Among them, 15 subjects (12%) experienced re-intubation. CPF was lower in re-intubated subjects than those without re-intubation (measured by a spirometer: 54 ± 30 L/min vs 86 ± 37 L/min, P < .001; and measured by a ventilator: 50 ± 22 L/min vs 80 ± 26 L/min, P < .001). CPF measured by a spirometer and a ventilator had similar area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic (0.79 vs 0.83, P = .26).

When it was measured by a ventilator, the cutoff value, sensitivity, and specificity were 56 L/min, 73%, and 85%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS CPF measurement by a ventilator was convenient, affordable, and safe.

Patients received treatment with 40 hyperbaric oxygen sessions and outcome parameters were assessed at Week 16. RESULTS Seven women and 13 men were included (median age 34 years). At Week 16, median scores of perianal disease activity index and modified van Assche index (co-primary outcome parameters) decreased from 7.5 (95% CI 6-9) to 4 (95% CI 3-6, P < 0.001), and from 9.2 (95% CI 7.3-11.2) to 7.3 (95% CI 6.9-9.7, P = 0.004) respectively. Perianal disease activity index scores ≤4 (representing inactive perianal disease) were observed in 13/20 patients (65%). Twelve patients showed a clinical response (60%) and four (20%) clinical remission, assessed with fistula drainage assessment. Median C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin levels decreased from 4.2 mg/mL (95% CI 1.6-8) to 2.2 (95% CI 0.9-4.3, P = 0.003) and from 399 µg/g (95% CI 52-922) to 31 (95% CI 16-245, P = 0.001), respectively.

In many cases, this has challenged patient-centered care. We set out to examine individuals' attitudes toward shared decision making (SDM) and to identify predictors of participation preference during the pandemic. METHODS We conducted an online survey with a large convenience sample (N = 1061). Our main measures of interest were participants' generic and COVID-19-related participation preference as well as their acceptance and distress regarding a triage vignette. We also assessed anxiety, e-health literacy, and aspects of participants' health. We conducted group comparisons and multiple linear regression analyses on participation preference as well as triage acceptance. RESULTS In generic decision making, most participants expressed a strong need for information and a moderate participation preference. In the hypothetical case of COVID-19 infection, most preferred physician-led decisions. Generic participation preference was the strongest predictor of COVID-19-related participation preference, followed by age, education, and anxiety. Furthermore, both higher generic and COVID-19-related participation preferences predicted lower triage acceptance. CONCLUSION Our findings demonstrate potential health care recipients' attitudes toward SDM during a severe health care crisis and emphasize that participation preference varies according to the context.","Köther, Anja K; Siebenhaar, Katharina U; Alpers, Georg W",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x211004147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33783266/,636

148360,Twin epidemics of covid-19 and non-communicable disease.,2020-06-30,"INTRODUCTION The aim was to clarify the influence on patient prognosis of ground glass opacity (GGO) component in each new TNM stage and propose grouping reflecting the prognosis more accurately. METHODS We examined the data on 1290 patients who underwent lung cancer resection from 2003 to 2011. The demographics and overall survival of patients with adenocarcinoma with and without GGO, squamous cell carcinoma, and the others were compared according to clinical stage from 0 to IB. In adenocarcinoma, we examined the distribution of histological subtypes of adenocarcinoma with and without GGO in each clinical stage. RESULTS Each clinical stage differentiated overall survival well. However, the prognosis of the patients with adenocarcinoma with GGO was considerably more favorable than that of the others in clinical stage IA2 and IA3 but not of those in clinical stage IB. In clinical stage 0 to IA3, patients showing adenocarcinoma in situ, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, and invasive lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma accounted for about 50% of the total number of patients with adenocarcinoma with GGO (stage 0, 16 of 21; stage IA1, 113 of 143; stage IA2, 80 of 157; and stage IA3, 45 of 94). In clinical stage IB, 20% of adenocarcinomas with GGO showed invasive solid predominant adenocarcinoma (IB, seven of 38). Most of the adenocarcinomas without GGO were in clinical stage IA2 to IB, and the distribution of histological subtypes was similar at each clinical stage. Invasive acinar and solid predominant adenocarcinomas were more common in adenocarcinoma without GGO. CONCLUSIONS Clinical T classification considering GGO component may offer more accurate prognosis for patients with lung cancer less than 3 cm in invasive diameter.","Aokage, Keiju; Miyoshi, Tomohiro; Ishii, Genichiro; Kusumoto, Masahiro; Nomura, Shogo; Katsumata, Shinya; Sekihara, Keigo; Tane, Kenta; Tsuboi, Masahiro",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2017.11.129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246833/,636
148477,Role of donor self-reporting in securing blood safety during COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-12-14,"PURPOSE There are various reconstruction methods for Laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy (LPG), such as esophagogastrostomy (EG), double-tract reconstruction, and jejunal interposition. We have performed EG using a circular stapler (OrVil) from 2013 and using a linear stapler from 2017. The aim of this retrospective study was to clarify which stapler is better for EG for LPG. METHODS The data of 84 patients who underwent EG for LPG between January 2013 and September 2019 were analyzed. EG with fundoplication was done using a circular stapler (OrVil) in 45 patients (CS group) and a linear stapler in 39 patients (LS group). The patients' medical records were reviewed. Clinical symptoms were obtained by interview at each outpatient consultation. All patients underwent postoperative 1-year follow-up endoscopy. To minimize bias between the two groups, propensity scores were calculated using a logistic regression model. After propensity-score matching, 60 patients (30 in the CS group and 30 in the LS group) were studied. RESULTS Patient characteristics, operative outcomes were similar in two groups. Anastomotic leakage occurred in one patient (3.3%) in both groups. Anastomotic stenosis occurred in five patients (16.7%) in the CS group and two patients (6.7%) in the LS group. The rate of patients with severe reflux esophagitis (grade C or D) was significantly lower in the LS group (3.4%) than in the CS group (26.7%) (p = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS EG with a linear stapler could reduce the risk of severe reflux esophagitis, and it could be a safe and feasible anastomosis for patients after LPG.","Sugita, Hirofumi; Sakuramoto, Shinichi; Oya, Shuichiro; Fujiwara, Naoto; Miyawaki, Yutaka; Satoh, Hiroshi; Okamoto, Kojun; Yamaguchi, Shigeki; Koyama, Isamu",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-021-02250-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34155545/,636

This is the first report describing the relationship between TSH and extraperitoneal colostomy. A 72-year-old man underwent laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection with extraperitoneal sigmoid colostomy and partial hepatectomy for rectal cancer accompanied by synchronous liver metastasis (pT3N1aM1a Stage IVA Union for International Cancer Control [UICC] 8th edition). The surgical procedures were completely performed without morbidity. After 1 year, he presented to our hospital with sudden nausea. Computed tomography (CT) revealed small bowel obstruction due to a 5-mm TSH, 1 cm from the stoma. The patient underwent laparoscopic hernia repair. The incidence of a 5-mm TSH is low. However, an abdominal wall vulnerability caused by the extensive exfoliation of the retroperitoneum due to the construction of the colostomy was observed, and the extraperitoneal colostomy influenced the onset of the 5-mm TSH. When the port and hernia sites are located in close proximity to each other, even a 5-mm trocar site may increase the incidence of TSH.","Fuse, Masahiro; Ozawa, Mayumi; Sato, Seiya; Goto, Koki; Suwa, Yusuke; Nakagawa, Kazuya; Ishibe, Atsushi; Watanabe, Jun; Endo, Itaru","Journal of the anus, rectum and colon",https://doi.org/10.23922/jarc.2020-078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33937562/,636

150281,A Psychiatric Residency in the Era of COVID-19: A Bionian Perspective.,2020,"Many nosocomial outbreaks exhibit ""superspreading events"" in which cross-transmission occurs via a single individual to a large number of patients. We investigated how heterogeneity in Health-Care Worker (HCW) behaviors, especially compliance to hand hygiene, may cause superspreading events. In particular, we compared the superspreading potential of peripatetic (noncohorted) HCWs with that of other HCWs. We developed an agent-based model for hand transmission of a pathogen in a hospital ward. Three HCW profiles were allowed: 2 assigned profiles, one with frequent contacts with a limited number of patients, another with fewer contacts but with more patients; and one peripatetic profile, with a single daily contact with all patients. We used data from the literature on common nosocomial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococci). The average number of patients colonized over 1 month increases with noncompliance to hand hygiene. Importantly, we show that this increase depends on the profile of noncompliant HCWs; for instance, it remains low for a single noncompliant assigned HCW but can be quite large for a single noncompliant peripatetic HCW. Outbreaks with this single fully noncompliant peripatetic HCW (representing only 4.5% of the staff) are similar to those predicted when all HCWs are noncompliant following 23% of patient contacts. Noncompliant peripatetic HCWs may play a disproportionate role in disseminating pathogens in a hospital ward. Their unique profile makes them potential superspreaders. This suggests that average compliance to hygiene may not be a good indicator of nosocomial risk in real life health care settings with several HCW profiles.","Temime, Laura; Opatowski, Lulla; Pannet, Yohan; Brun-Buisson, Christian; Boëlle, Pierre Yves; Guillemot, Didier",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0900974106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19841263/,636

AIMS To investigate the contribution of general practitioners (GPs) to the management of patients with CAP in the Netherlands. METHODS The study population consisted of all people enlisted in a GP network. We obtained information on CAP episodes from GP electronic records (using ICPC code R81) during the years 2002-2009. CAP registrations were also obtained from national hospital discharge data (ICD-9 codes) and cause of death statistics (ICD-10 codes). The three registration systems were linked at the individual level. We used descriptive analyses to estimate the annual number of CAP episodes (i.e. defined as a CAP diagnosis within 30 days). RESULTS From 2002 to 2009 the mean annual size of the study population was 395,039. For this population, 3,700 (0.9%) CAP episodes per year were registered in at least one of the registration systems, 2,933 (79%) of which were in the GP system only. Recovery within 30 days occurred on average in 95% (2,791/2,933) of the CAP episodes annually registered by a GP, while 2.3% (67/2,933) of patients with a GP-registered CAP episode were admitted to hospital within 30 days and 1% (26/2,933) had a fatal outcome within 30 days.

152444,"COVID-19: the biggest life-saver of all time, but how big?",2021-01-26,"COVID-19 has been associated with cardiac injury and dysfunction. While both myocardial inflammatory cell infiltration and myocarditis with myocyte injury have been reported in patients with fatal COVID-19, clinical-pathologic correlations remain limited. The objective was to determine the relationships between cardiac pathological changes in patients dying from COVID-19 and cardiac infection by SARS-CoV-2, laboratory measurements, clinical features, and treatments. In a retrospective study, 41 consecutive autopsies of patients with fatal COVID-19 were analyzed for the associations between cardiac inflammation, myocarditis, cardiac infection by SARS-CoV-2, clinical features, laboratory measurements, and treatments. Cardiac infection was assessed by in situ hybridization and NanoString transcriptomic profiling. Cardiac infection by SARS-CoV-2 was present in 30/41 cases: virus+ with myocarditis (n = 4), virus+ without myocarditis (n = 26), and virus- without myocarditis (n = 11). In the cases with cardiac infection, SARS-CoV-2+ cells in the myocardium were rare, with a median density of 1 cell/cm2. Virus+ cases showed higher densities of myocardial CD68+ macrophages and CD3+ lymphocytes, as well as more electrocardiographic changes (23/27 vs 4/10; P = 0.01). Myocarditis was more prevalent with IL-6 blockade than with nonbiologic immunosuppression, primarily glucocorticoids (2/3 vs 0/14; P = 0.02). Overall, SARS-CoV-2 cardiac infection was less prevalent in patients treated with nonbiologic immunosuppression (7/14 vs 21/24; P = 0.02). Myocardial macrophage and lymphocyte densities overall were positively correlated with the duration of symptoms but not with underlying comorbidities. In summary, cardiac infection with SARS-CoV-2 is common among patients dying from COVID-19 but often with only rare infected cells. Cardiac infection by SARS-CoV-2 is associated with more cardiac inflammation and electrocardiographic changes. Nonbiologic immunosuppression is associated with lower incidences of myocarditis and cardiac infection by SARS-CoV-2.","Bearse, Mayara; Hung, Yin P; Krauson, Aram J; Bonanno, Liana; Boyraz, Baris; Harris, Cynthia K; Helland, T Leif; Hilburn, Caroline F; Hutchison, Bailey; Jobbagy, Soma; Marshall, Michael S; Shepherd, Daniel J; Villalba, Julian A; Delfino, Isabela; Mendez-Pena, Javier; Chebib, Ivan; Newton-Cheh, Christopher; Stone, James R","Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41379-021-00790-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33727695/,636

Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene have been implicated in an autosomal dominant form of PD with variable penetrance. The identification of a common LRRK2 variant (p.Gly2019Ser) in dementia with Lewy bodies indicated its potential role in Parkinsonian disorder. The current study was aimed to identify the p.Gly2019Ser variant in Indian patients with Parkinsonian disorder. Methods The patient group consisting of 412 classical PD patients, 107 PD patients with cognitive impairment, 107 patients with Parkinson plus syndrome and 200 unrelated controls were recruited from eastern part of India. The allele representing p.Gly2019Ser variant was screened by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results The p.Gly2019Ser variant was identified in an East Indian young-onset female PD patient in a heterozygous state having several motor and autonomic problems without disturbed cognition. Her younger brother, sister and elder son harbouring the same mutation were asymptomatic carriers for the variant. However, the influence of DNM3 on decreased disease onset in this family was not clear.

This single arm cohort seeks to determine whether such methods are suitable in patients with comorbidities or higher age. METHODS Two hundred sixty-six patients received radiofrequency ablation (RFA), CT-guided high-dose rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) or Y90-radioembolization (Y90-RE) during treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This cohort comprised of patients with heterogenous disease stages from single liver lesions to multiple organ systems involvement commonly following multiple chemotherapy lines. Data was reviewed retrospectively for patient demographics, previous therapies, initial or disease stages at first intervention, comorbidities and mortality. Comorbidity was measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and age-adjusted Charlson Index (CACI) excluding mCRC as the index disease. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Overall median survival of 266 patients was 14 months. Age ≥ 70 years did not influence survival after local therapies. Similarly, CCI or CACI did not affect the patients prognoses in multivariate analyses. Moderate or severe renal insufficiency (n = 12; p = 0.005) was the only single comorbidity identified to negatively affect the outcome after local therapy. CONCLUSION Interventional procedures for mCRC may be performed safely even in elderly and comorbid patients. In severe renal insufficiency, the use of invasive techniques should be limited to selected cases.","Seidensticker, Ricarda; Damm, Robert; Enge, Julia; Seidensticker, Max; Mohnike, Konrad; Pech, Maciej; Hass, Peter; Amthauer, Holger; Ricke, Jens",BMC cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-018-4784-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30200921/,636

OBJECTIVE To explore the presentation of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in NHPI. METHOD We conducted a retrospective review of patient records from Hawaii with a diagnosis of unspecified AD or MCI from September 2000 to September 2019. Variables of interest included age at diagnosis, gender, race, marital status, insurance, comorbidities, and scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). RESULTS We reviewed the medical records of 598 patients, including 224 Asians, 202 Whites, 87 NHPI, and 85 Other. AD was more dominant than MCI across all of the groups, with the highest percentage in NHPI. Among the mean ages of diagnosis, NHPI were the youngest. Across all groups, a higher proportion of women than men had AD, with the highest female prevalence among NHPI. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes were highest among NHPI compared with the other groups. Of individuals with MMSE/MoCA scores, there were significant variations in scores by racial group. The mean MMSE/MoCA score was highest among Whites and lowest among NHPI. CONCLUSION Compared with other racial groups, NHPI have a higher proportion of AD than MCI at diagnosis, are diagnosed at a younger age, have a higher female prevalence, have more comorbidities that may contribute to AD/MCI onset, and present with lower MMSE scores.","Smith, Maiya; Van, Nicholas; Roberts, Alyssa; Hosaka, Kalei R J; Choi, So Yung; Viereck, Jason; Carrazana, Enrique; Borman, Pat; Chen, John J; Liow, Kore Kai",Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1097/wnn.0000000000000279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34473671/,636

BACKGROUND Dihydroergotamine (DHE) has long been used to treat migraine, but intravenous administration is invasive, frequently associated with adverse events (AEs), and not suitable for at-home administration. INP104 is an investigational drug device that delivers DHE mesylate to the upper nasal space using a Precision Olfactory Delivery technology and was developed to overcome the shortcomings of available DHE products. METHODS STOP 301 was an open-label, 24-week safety study, with a 28-week extension period. After a 28-day screening period where patients used their ""best usual care"" to treat migraine attacks, patients were given INP104 (1.45 mg) to self-administer nasally with self-recognized attacks. The primary objective of this study was to assess safety and tolerability, with a specific focus on nasal mucosa and olfactory function. Exploratory objectives included efficacy assessments of migraine measures and a patient acceptability questionnaire. RESULTS A total of 360 patients entered the 24-week treatment period, with 354 patients dosing at least once. INP104-related treatment-emergent AEs were reported by 36.7% (130/354) of patients, and 6.8% (24/354) discontinued treatment due to AEs over 24 weeks. No new safety signals were observed following delivery to the upper nasal space. Pain freedom, the most bothersome symptom freedom, and pain relief at 2 h post-INP104 were self-reported by 38.0% (126/332), 52.1% (173/332), and 66.3% (167/252) of patients, respectively. A low recurrence rate at 24 and 48 h was observed (7.1% [9/126] and 14.3% [18/126], respectively). Most patients found INP104 easy to use and preferred it over their current therapy. CONCLUSIONS INP104 has the potential to deliver rapid symptom relief, without injection, that is well tolerated and suitable for outpatient use. Results suggest INP104 may be a promising treatment for patients with migraine.","Smith, Timothy R; Winner, Paul; Aurora, Sheena K; Jeleva, Maria; Hocevar-Trnka, Jasna; Shrewsbury, Stephen B",Headache,https://doi.org/10.1111/head.14184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34363701/,636

155539,An outbreak of acute hemorrhagic papules on the posterior neck in children during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-09-06,"OBJECTIVE Pneumonia is a lung infection and causes the inflammation of the small air sacs (Alveoli) in one or both lungs. Proper and faster diagnosis of pneumonia at an early stage is imperative for optimal patient care. Currently, chest X-ray is considered as the best imaging modality for diagnosing pneumonia. However, the interpretation of chest X-ray images is challenging. To this end, we aimed to use an automated convolutional neural network-based transfer-learning approach to detect pneumonia in paediatric chest radiographs. METHODS Herein, an automated convolutional neural network-based transfer-learning approach using four different pre-trained models (i.e. VGG19, DenseNet121, Xception, and ResNet50) was applied to detect pneumonia in children (1-5 years) chest X-ray images. The performance of different proposed models for testing data set was evaluated using five performances metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity/recall, Precision, area under curve, and F1 score. RESULTS All proposed models provide accuracy greater than 83.0% for binary classification. The pre-trained DenseNet121 model provides the highest classification performance of automated pneumonia classification with 86.8% accuracy, followed by Xception model with an accuracy of 86.0%. The sensitivity of the proposed models was greater than 91.0%. The Xception and DenseNet121 models achieve the highest classification performance with F1-score greater than 89.0%. The plotted area under curve of receiver operating characteristics of VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 models are 0.78, 0.81, 0.81, and 0.86, respectively. CONCLUSION Our data showed that the proposed models achieve a high accuracy for binary classification. Transfer learning was used to accelerate training of the proposed models and resolve the problem associated with insufficient data. We hope that these proposed models can help radiologists for a quick diagnosis of pneumonia at radiology departments. Moreover, our proposed models may be useful to detect other chest-related diseases such as novel Coronavirus 2019. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE Herein, we used transfer learning as a machine learning approach to accelerate training of the proposed models and resolve the problem associated with insufficient data. Our proposed models achieved accuracy greater than 83.0% for binary classification.","Salehi, Mohammad; Mohammadi, Reza; Ghaffari, Hamed; Sadighi, Nahid; Reiazi, Reza",The British journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20201263; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861150/,636

The present study describes abdominal imaging features of 11 ferrets with FSCV. Abdominal survey radiographs were available for eight ferrets and ultrasound examination for all cases. Loss of lumbar musculature, decreased peritoneal detail, presence of mid-abdominal soft-tissue masses and splenomegaly were the most significant radiographic signs in these patients. Ultrasonographic findings including peritonitis, abdominal lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, abdominal soft-tissue masses, nephromegaly and changes in the renal cortex echogenicity were recorded in the majority of cases with FSCV. As an imaging modality, ultrasound is superior to radiology when abdominal contrast is reduced, as it frequently occurs in these cases. However, although imaging techniques provide additional information in the antemortem diagnosis, they can not replace the definitive diagnosis based on histological and immunohistochemical results.","Dominguez, E; Novellas, R; Moya, A; Espada, Y; Martorell, J",The Veterinary record,https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.d4705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21862468/,636

Misinterpretation of these mutations would mislead people about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Materials & methods: With 4521 lines of SARS-CoV-2, we obtained 3169 unique point mutation sites. We counted the numbers and calculated the minor allele frequency (MAF) of each mutation type. Results: Nearly half of the point mutations are C-T mismatches and 20% are A-G mismatches. The MAF of C-T and A-G mismatches is significantly higher than MAF of other mutation types. Conclusion: The excessive C-T mismatches do not resemble the random mutation profile. They are likely to be caused by the cytosine-to-uridine deamination system in hosts.","Li, Yue; Yang, Xinai; Wang, Na; Wang, Haiyan; Yin, Bin; Yang, Xiaoping; Jiang, Wenqing",Future microbiology,https://doi.org/10.2217/fmb-2020-0149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33085541/,636

Despite youth status as ""tech natives,"" limited data are available on their perspectives on telemedicine. Our study seeks to understand youth telemedicine knowledge, prior experiences, preferences for use, and the impact of COVID-19 on these perspectives. Methods: Participants in MyVoice, a national text message cohort of U.S. youth age 14-24, were sent five open-ended questions in October 2019 and October 2020. A codebook was iteratively developed by using inductive analysis. Responses were independently coded by two investigators, with discrepancies resolved by discussion or a third investigator. Results: Sixty-five percent (836/1,283) and 77% (887/1,129) of participants responded to at least 1 question in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Most youth reported awareness of telemedicine and although many have not used it, COVID-19 has increased use. Further, many are willing to try telemedicine services. Most youth noted a preference for video rather than phone visits, but they believe both to be less effective than in person. Youth also reported varied preferences on services best suited for telemedicine, with COVID-19 positively impacting their views. Discussion: Youth are aware of and willing to use telemedicine services, with many reporting use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Youth are willing to accept a wide variety of telemedicine services, though they still desire in-person options. Health systems and clinics should offer a wide range of services via telemedicine to fit the varying needs of youth both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Waselewski, Marika Elise; Waselewski, Eric Andrew; Wasvary, Margaret; Wood, Georgia; Pratt, Keagan; Chang, Tammy; Hines, Aliya Courtney",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34415810/,636

We are here to investigate the feasibility of the trans-abdominal partial extra-peritoneal (TAPE) technique in lumbar hernia repair. METHODS The TAPE technique was applied to 14 patients with lumbar hernia from May 2009 until January 2014. The surgical technique was described in details and follow-ups were performed for further evaluation. RESULTS The mean age of the 14 patients was 68 ± 8 years, with the average BMI 25.5 ± 2.1 kg/m(2). The etiology study showed that 13 cases after surgical operations and one case after trauma. The average size of the hernia defect was 86.8 ± 46.4 cm(2), while the mean size of the mesh implanted was 275 ± 61.2 cm(2). The mean operative time was 59.2 ± 8.2 min. There was no intra-operative visceral injury in this serial of cases. There was no conversion case and all patients accepted the TAPE technique successfully. The VAS was 3.8 ± 1.9 and 2.2 ± 1.6 on POD1 and POD3, respectively. The mean post-operative hospital stay was 4.0 ± 1.3 days. The median follow-up time was 33 months. All patients returned to unrestricted movement within 2 weeks after surgery. During the follow-ups, no complication as bulge, seroma, hematoma, wound infection, abscess in surgical area and chronic pain, nor recurrence was observed. CONCLUSIONS According to our experience in this series of investigations, the TAPE could be a feasible and easy-to-learn technique which can be applied to most of the lumbar hernia repairs.","Sun, Jing; Chen, Xin; Li, Jianwen; Zhang, Yun; Dong, Feng; Zheng, Minhua",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-015-0104-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26507827/,636
161086,The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Challenge for Obesity Research and Management.,2020-09-22,"BACKGROUND There is limited information on severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children. METHODS We retrieved data from the national database on SARS-CoV-2 infections. We studied in-family transmission. The level of viral load was categorized as high, moderate, or low based on the cycle threshold values. RESULTS We studied 203 SARS-CoV-2-infected children (median age: 11 years; range: 6 days to 18.4 years); 111 (54.7%) had an asymptomatic infection. Among the 92 children (45.3%) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 24 (26.1%) were hospitalized. Infants <1 year were more likely to develop COVID-19 (19.5% of all COVID-19 cases) (P-value = 0.001). There was no significant difference between viral load and age, sex, underlying condition, fever and hospitalization, as well as between type of SARS-CoV-2 infection and age, sex, underlying condition and viral load. Transmission from a household member accounted for 132 of 178 (74.2%) children for whom the source of infection was identified. An adult member with COVID-19 was the first case in 125 (66.8%) family clusters. Child-to-adult transmission was found in one occasion only. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 infection is mainly asymptomatic or mild during childhood. Adults appear to play a key role in spread of the virus in families. Most children have moderate or high viral loads regardless of age, symptoms or severity of infection. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of children in the ongoing pandemic and particularly in light of schools reopening and the need to prioritize groups for vaccination, when COVID-19 vaccines will be available.","Maltezou, Helena C; Magaziotou, Ioanna; Dedoukou, Xanthi; Eleftheriou, Eirini; Raftopoulos, Vasilios; Michos, Athanasios; Lourida, Athanasia; Panopoulou, Maria; Stamoulis, Konstantinos; Papaevangelou, Vasiliki; Petinaki, Efthimia; Mentis, Andreas; Papa, Anna; Tsakris, Athanasios; Roilides, Emmanuel; Syrogiannopoulos, George A; Tsolia, Maria",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002899; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33031141/,636

Following Michel Bitbol, I suggest one way to mitigate this crisis of faith may be for science to become more epistemically modest, renouncing some of its claims to describe reality as it objectively is, and adopting an “intransitive” rather than a “transitive” approach to Nature. This was the attitude adopted by the Greco-Roman medical school of the Empirics, which may also be of assistance in combatting the urgent problem of Fake News. The epistemology of Skepticism and the scientific methodology of the closely related Medical Empiricism shows that an epistemically modest, non-interventionist approach to science is quite compatible with a robust and sophisticated proto-experimental scientific methodology. © 2021, University of Warsaw.

However, current research efforts have largely been unilateral, focusing on psychopathology and not including well-being, and are dominated by examining average psychopathology levels or on disorder absence/presence, thereby ignoring individual differences in mental health. Knowledge on individual differences, as depicted by latent subgroups, in the full spectrum of mental health may provide valuable insights in how individuals transition between health states and factors that predict transitioning from resilient to symptomatic classes. Our aim is to (1) identify longitudinal classes (i.e., subgroups of individuals) based on indicators of PTSD, AD, and well-being in response to the pandemic and (2) examine predictors of transitioning between these subgroups. Methods and analysis We will conduct a three-wave longitudinal online survey-study of n [≥] 2000 adults from the general Dutch population. The first measurement occasion takes place six months after the start of the pandemic, followed by two follow-up measurements with six months intervals. Latent transition analysis will be used for data-analysis. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from four Dutch universities. Longitudinal study designs are vital to monitor mental health (and predictors thereof) in the pandemic to develop preventive and curative mental health interventions.

A clear understanding of the cell types and functional programs during hematopoietic development is central to research in aging, cancer, and infectious diseases. Known cell types are traditionally identified by the expression of proteins on the surface of the cells. Stem and progenitor cells defined based on these markers are assigned functions based on their lineage potential. The rapid growth of single cell RNA sequencing technologies (scRNAseq) provides a new modality for evaluating the cellular and functional landscape of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The popularity of this technology among hematopoiesis researchers enables us to conduct a robust meta-analysis of mouse bone marrow scRNAseq data. Using over 300,000 cells across 12 datasets, we evaluate the classification and function of cell types based on discrete clustering, in silico FACS sorting, and a continuous trajectory. We identify replicable signatures that define cell types based on genes and known cellular functions. Additionally, we evaluate the conservation of signatures associated with erythroid and monocyte lineage development across species using co-expression networks. The co-expression networks predict the effectiveness of the signature at identifying erythroid and monocyte cells in zebrafish and human scRNAseq data. Together, this analysis provides a robust reference, particularly marker genes and functional annotations, for future experiments in hematopoietic development.

165131,Dementia and COVID-19 pandemia: The situation in various European countries,2021,"YouTube is by far the largest host of user-generated video content worldwide. Alas, the platform has also come under fire for hosting inappropriate, toxic, and hateful content. One community that has often been linked to sharing and publishing hateful and misogynistic content are the Involuntary Celibates (Incels), a loosely defined movement ostensibly focusing on men's issues. In this paper, we set out to analyze the Incel community on YouTube by focusing on this community's evolution over the last decade and understanding whether YouTube's recommendation algorithm steers users towards Incel-related videos. We collect videos shared on Incel communities within Reddit and perform a data-driven characterization of the content posted on YouTube. Among other things, we find that the Incel community on YouTube is getting traction and that, during the last decade, the number of Incel-related videos and comments rose substantially. We also find that users have a 6.3% chance of being suggested an Incel-related video by YouTube's recommendation algorithm within five hops when starting from a non Incel-related video. Overall, our findings paint an alarming picture of online radicalization: not only Incel activity is increasing over time, but platforms may also play an active role in steering users towards such extreme content.","Papadamou, Kostantinos; Zannettou, Savvas; Blackburn, Jeremy; Cristofaro, Emiliano De; Stringhini, Gianluca; Sirivianos, Michael",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08293v7.pdf,636

In 2011, a novel member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, Influenza D virus (IDV), was identified in the respiratory tract of diseased swine. Epidemiological surveys revealed that IDV is distributed worldwide among livestock and that IDV-directed antibodies are detected in humans with occupational exposure to livestock. To identify the transmission capability of IDV to humans, we determined the viral replication kinetics and cell tropism using an in vitro respiratory epithelium model of humans. The inoculation of IDV revealed efficient replication kinetics and apical progeny virus release at different body temperatures. Intriguingly, the replication characteristics of IDV revealed many similarities to the human-associated Influenza C virus, including the cell tropism preference for ciliated cells. Collectively, these results might indicate why IDV-directed antibodies are detected among humans with occupational exposure to livestock. One-sentence summary of the conclusion We show that the ruminant-associated Influenza D virus has direct transmission capability to humans.","Holwerda, Melle; Laloli, Laura; Stürmer, Isabel; Portmann, Jasmine; Stalder, Hanspeter; Dijkman, Ronald",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/395517,636

However, limited by the space for camera installation and the miniature structure of the tool itself, monitoring the wear of LCD panel cutting wheel is not a simple task. In this research, we proposed a machine-vision based instrumentation system and a systematic methodology for cutting wheel degradation monitoring. The proposed method describes the degradation of cutting wheel by estimating the tooth height of the cutting wheel blade based on the partially observed random samples. A series of methods are proposed to improve the reliability of the results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated based on the field data that is collected from three maintenance cycles. The validation results demonstrate consistent degradation trend of the cutting wheel over production cycles.","Wang, Yinglu; Jia, Xiaodong; Li, Xiang; Yang, Shaojie; Zhao, Haodong; Lee, Jay",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920314682; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920314682,636

Critical functions of these receptors render them potential pharmacological targets for the treatment of a broad spectrum of inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we use atomistic studies to show that phospholipids can act as potent regulators of peptide binding on to the receptor. We simulated the binding of neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP27) into the transmembrane bundle of the receptor. The simulations reveal two lipid binding sites on the peptidic ligand for the negatively charged phosphodiester of phospholipids in the extracellular leaflet which lower the peptide-receptor binding free energy by ~8kBT. We further simulated the effect of anionic lipids phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). These lipids show much stronger interaction, lowering the peptide-receptor binding energy by an additional ~7kBT compared to POPC lipids. These findings suggest that lipids can play an active role in catalyzing peptide-receptor binding and activating vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptors.","Thomas, Nidhin; Agrawal, Ashutosh",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.18.436073,636

167029,Experience of Haematological Observatory Ward during Covid-10 Pandemic,2021,"The antiviral protein kinase R (PKR) is an important host restriction factor, which poxviruses must overcome to productively infect host cells. To inhibit PKR, many poxviruses encode a pseudosubstrate mimic of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), designated K3 in vaccinia virus. Although the interaction between PKR and eIF2α is highly conserved, some K3 orthologs were previously shown to inhibit PKR in a species-specific manner. To better define this host range function, we compared the sensitivity of PKR from 17 mammals to inhibition by K3 orthologs from closely related orthopoxviruses. The K3 orthologs showed species-specific inhibition of PKR and exhibited three distinct inhibition profiles. In some cases, PKR from closely related species showed dramatic differences in their sensitivity to K3 orthologs. Vaccinia virus expressing the camelpox virus K3 ortholog replicated more than three orders of magnitude better in human and sheep cells than a virus expressing vaccinia virus K3, but both viruses replicated comparably well in cow cells. Strikingly, in site-directed mutagenesis experiments between the variola virus and camelpox virus K3 orthologs, we found that different amino acid combinations were necessary to mediate improved or diminished inhibition of PKR derived from different host species. Because there is likely a limited number of possible variations in PKR that affect K3-interactions but still maintain PKR/eIF2α interactions, by chance PKR from some potential new hosts may be susceptible to K3-mediated inhibition from a virus it has never previously encountered. We conclude that neither the sensitivity of host proteins to virus inhibition nor the effectiveness of viral immune antagonists can be inferred from their phylogenetic relatedness but must be experimentally determined. Authors summary Most virus families are composed of large numbers of virus species. However, in general, only a few prototypic viruses are experimentally studied in-depth, and it is often assumed that the obtained results are representative of other viruses in the same family. In order to test this assumption, we compared the sensitivity of the antiviral protein kinase PKR from various mammals to inhibition by multiple orthologs of K3, a PKR inhibitor expressed by several closely related orthopoxviruses. We found strong differences in PKR inhibition by the K3 orthologs, demonstrating that sensitivity to a specific inhibitor was not indicative of broad sensitivity to orthologs of these inhibitors from closely related viruses. We also show that PKR from even closely related species displayed markedly different sensitivities to these poxvirus inhibitors. Furthermore, we identified amino acid residues in these K3 orthologs that are critical for enhanced or decreased PKR inhibition and found that distinct amino acid combinations affected PKRs from various species differently. Our study shows that even closely related inhibitors of an antiviral protein can vary dramatically in their inhibitory potential, and cautions that results from host-virus interaction studies of a prototypic virus genus member cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other viruses in the same genus without experimental verification.","Park, Chorong; Peng, Chen; Rahman, M.

Of the 37 provinces in Indonesia, five provinces with the highest case fatality rates were DKI Jakarta, Jawa Barat, Jawa Timur, and Banten, and the five provinces with the highest cure rate were Kepulauan Riau, Bali, Aceh, Gorontalo, and DI Yogyakarta. SARS-CoV-2 Indonesian isolates were closely related to SARS-CoV-2 isolates from other countries. The rapid and widespread distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in Indonesia was caused by the lack of compliance with territorial restrictions and dishonesty with medical personnel.

CoronaVac is an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that has been rolled out in several low and middle-income countries including Brazil, where it was the mainstay of the first wave of immunization of health care workers and the elderly population. We aimed to assess the T cell and antibody responses of vaccinees as compared to convalescent subjects. Methods. We detected IgG against SARS-CoV-2 antigens, neutralizing antibodies against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, and used SARS-CoV-2 peptides to detect IFN-g and IL-2 specific T cell responses in a cohort of CoronaVac vaccinees ( N=101) and convalescent ( N=72) individuals. Findings. Among vaccinees, 95% displayed T cell or antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 as compared to 99% convalescent individuals. However, we observed that among vaccinees, males and individuals 55 years or older developed significantly lower anti-RBD, anti-NP and neutralizing antibody responses as well as antigen-induced IL-2 production by T cells. Interpretation. Even though some studies indicated Coronavac helped reduce mortality among elderly people, considering the current dominance of the gamma variant of concern (VOC) and potential increase of the delta VOC, in Brazil, our data support that Coronavac vaccinees above 55 years old are likely to benefit from a third dose to boost immune response and protection.

One consequence has been a massive proliferation of host-virus association data, which comprise the backbone of research in viral macroecology and zoonotic risk prediction. These data remain fragmented across numerous data portals and projects, each with their own scope, structure, and reporting standards. Here, we propose that synthesis of host-virus association data is a central challenge to improve our understanding of the global virome and develop foundational theory in viral ecology. To illustrate this, we build an open reconciled mammal-virus database from four key published datasets, applying a standardized taxonomy and metadata. We show that reconciling these datasets provides a substantially richer view of the mammal virome than that offered by any one individual database. We argue for a shift in best practice towards the incremental development and use of synthetic datasets in viral ecology research, both to improve comparability and replicability across studies, and to facilitate future efforts to use machine learning to predict the structure and dynamics of the global virome.","Gibb, Rory; Albery, Gregory F.; Becker, Daniel J.; Brierley, Liam; Connor, Ryan; Dallas, Tad A.; Eskew, Evan A.; Farrell, Maxwell J.; Rasmussen, Angela L.; Ryan, Sadie J.; Sweeny, Amy; Carlson, Colin J.; Poisot, Timothée",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.14.426572,636

The Mexican federal government declared phase two of the plan to reduce COVID-19 spread on March 24, 2020. In some states, mobility restriction measures started by March 17 included the education system. On April 13, educational activities began in the remote mode exclusively, and this situation could be extended until the end of the 2020-2021 cycle, if health conditions do not improve. Universities, teachers, and students were not ready to implement the emergency remote teaching (ERT) strategy because of the limited conditions of technological adaptation and digital connectivity in the country. The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to investigate the experiences of graduate and undergraduate students concerning the change from face-to-face to the ERT modality in the health emergency context due to the COVID-19 outbreak. We collected data from 660 students from 38 universities and 22 states across the country. The study investigated students' previous experience with online courses, technological tool use, barriers faced during the new teaching-studying modality, current use of educational and specialized tools, and some physical and mental health indicators. As a result, we found problems related to time management of their work activities, the balance of time between home and school activities, and perception about studying days, which they felt strenuous. More than half of all students reported Internet connection problems. Students from private universities declared a higher use of technological tools. Students from public universities expressed more significant difficulties following teachers' instructions, perceived less attention from teachers, considered the change to remote courses was difficult, and felt overwhelmed by the required technological skills. Students in the first two years of university reported a higher proportion having deemed the most strenuous study days and having had difficulties following the teachers' instructions and considered that the distance modality change was hard. Finally, all the students declared that the expenses increased in their home in the highest proportion were electricity, mobile phone data, and Internet service. Future research should focus on measuring the impact of ERT on students' learning outcomes.","Zapata-Garibay, R.; Gonzalez-Fagoaga, J. E.; Meza-Rodriguez, E.

SARS-CoV-2 highlights the global impact emergence events can have. Considering the history and diversity of coronaviruses (CoVs), especially in bats, SARS-CoV-2 will likely not be the last to spillover from animals into human populations. We sampled and tested wildlife in the central African country Cameroon to determine which CoVs are circulating and how they relate to previously detected human and animal CoVs. We collected animal and ecological data at sampling locations and used family-level consensus PCR combined with amplicon sequencing for virus detection. Between 2003 and 2018, samples were collected from 6,580 animals of several different orders. CoV RNA was detected in 175 bats, a civet, and a shrew. The CoV RNAs detected in the bats represented 17 different genetic clusters, coinciding with alpha (n=8) and beta (n=9) CoVs. Sequences resembling human CoV-229E (HCoV-229E) were found in 40 Hipposideridae bats. Phylogenetic analyses place the human derived HCoV-229E isolates closest to those from camels in terms of the S and N genes, but closest to isolates from bats for the E, M, and RdRp genes. The CoV RNA positivity rate in bats varied significantly (p<0.001) between the wet (8.2%) and dry season (4.5%). Most sampled species accordingly had a wet season high and dry season low, while for some the opposite was found. Eight of the suspected CoV species of which we detected RNA appear to be entirely novel CoV species, which suggests that CoV diversity in African wildlife is still rather poorly understood. The detection of multiple different variants of HCoV-229E-like viruses supports the bat reservoir hypothesis for this virus, with the phylogenetic results casting some doubt on camels as an intermediate host. The findings also support the previously proposed influence of ecological factors on CoV circulation, indicating a high level of underlying complexity to the viral ecology. These results indicate the importance of investing in surveillance activities among wild animals to detect all potential threats as well as sentinel surveillance among exposed humans to determine emerging threats.","Ntumvi, Nkom F.; Ndze, Valantine Ngum; Gillis, Amethyst; Doux Diffo, Joseph Le; Tamoufe, Ubald; Takuo, Jean-Michel; Mouiche, Moctar M.

A question is whether there is an actual trade-off between saving lives and economic development. To answer this, we study the case of Vietnam, a successful story in combating the pandemic thanks to the Government’s immediate and rigorous policies. We collect official news related to the Covid-19 pandemic in Vietnam in the year 2020 by utilizing a self-developed web scraping tool. By analyzing the news data, we identify the key phases of the pandemic in Vietnam and the key Government policy announcements. We then contrast this information with the performance of the equity market and find that the two types of policies, including border and entry control and cross-country travel control, negatively impact the equity market, whilst the other policies hardly affect the stock market return.

While central countries-through their pharmaceutical multinationals-focused on the development of vaccines, semi-peripheral and peripheral countries fulfill another role, either by offering an environment for trials, or by inserting themselves in the hierarchical global order as a hub for research, development, or production of the candidate vaccines. This paper focuses on the analysis of the geopolitics of the world-system regarding production and participation in the clinical trials of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 of Oxford University-AstraZeneca, BioNTech-Pfizer, and Sinopharm in Argentina. This is a case analysis of the Argentine semi-peripheral context, the local and global pharmaceutical industry, and the geopolitical order. We conclude that Argentina, which has scientific and industrial capabilities to manufacture vaccines, has joined in global value chains on the dependence side, deepening the scientific and technological gap vis-a-vis the central countries.","Blinder, D.; Zubeldia, L.; Surtayeva, S.",Journal of World-Systems Research,https://doi.org/10.5195/jwsr.2021.1049,636

Here we measured how much explicit metacognitive information young adults have about their own facial expressions. Participants imitated pictures of themselves making facial expressions and triggered a camera to take a picture of them while doing so. They then rated confidence (how well they thought they imitated each expression). We defined metacognitive access to facial expressions as the relationship between objective performance (how well the two pictures matched) and subjective confidence ratings. Metacognitive access to facial expressions was very poor when we considered all face features indiscriminately. Instead, machine learning analyses revealed that participants rated confidence based on idiosyncratic subsets of features. We conclude that metacognitive access to own facial expressions is partial, and surprisingly limited.","Ciston, Anthony B; Forster, Carina; Brick, Timothy R; Kühn, Simone; Verrel, Julius; Filevich, Elisa",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.08.434069,636

We generated maVie16, a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, by serial passaging of a human isolate. In silico modelling revealed how Spike mutations of maVie16 enhanced interaction with murine ACE2. MaVie16 induced profound pathology in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice and the resulting mouse COVID-19 (mCOVID-19) replicated critical aspects of human disease, including early lymphopenia, pulmonary immune cell infiltration, pneumonia and specific adaptive immunity. Inhibition of the proinflammatory cytokines IFNγ and TNF substantially reduced immunopathology. Importantly, genetic ACE2-deficiency completely prevented mCOVID-19 development. Finally, inhalation therapy with recombinant ACE2 fully protected mice from mCOVID-19, revealing a novel and efficient treatment. Thus, we here present maVie16 as a new tool to model COVID-19 for the discovery of new therapies and show that disease severity is determined by cytokine-driven immunopathology and critically dependent on ACE2 in vivo. Key points The mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain maVie16 causes fatal disease in BALB/c mice and substantial inflammation, pneumonia and immunity in C57BL/6 mice TNFα/IFNγ blockade ameliorates maVie16-induced immunopathology MaVie16 infection depends on ACE2 and soluble ACE2 inhalation can prevent disease","Gawish, Riem; Starkl, Philipp; Pimenov, Lisabeth; Hladik, Anastasiya; Lakovits, Karin; Oberndorfer, Felicitas; Cronin, Shane J.F.; Ohradanova-Repic, Anna; Wirnsberger, Gerald; Agerer, Benedikt; Endler, Lukas; Capraz, Tümay; Perthold, Jan W.; Hagelkruys, Astrid; Montserrat, Nuria; Mirazimi, Ali; Boon, Louis; Stockinger, Hannes; Bergthaler, Andreas; Oostenbrink, Chris; Penninger, Josef M.; Knapp, Sylvia",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.09.455606,636

175917,Child Mortality in England During the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-08-24,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has become one of the most immediate and widely-studied systems since its identification and subsequent global outbreak from 2019-2020. In an effort to understand the biophysical changes as a result of mutations, the mechanics of multiple different proteins within the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been studied and compared with SARS-CoV-1. Focusing on the main protease (mPro), we first explored the long range dynamic-relationship, particularly in cross-chain dynamics, using the Dynamic Coupling Index (DCI) to investigate the dynamic coupling between the catalytic site residues and the rest of the protein, both inter and intra chain for the CoV-1 and CoV-2 mPro. We found that there is significant cross-chain coupling between these active sites and distal residues in the CoV-2 mPro but it was missing in CoV-1. The enhanced long distance interactions, particularly between the two chains, suggest subsequently enhanced cooperativity for CoV-2. A further comparative analysis of the dynamic flexibility using the Dynamic Flexibility Index (DFI) between the CoV-1 and CoV-2 mPros shows that the inhibitor binding near active sites induces change in flexibility to a distal region of the protein, opposite in behavior between the two systems; this region becomes more flexible upon inhibitor binding in CoV-1 while it becomes less flexible in the CoV-2 mPro. Upon inspection, we show that, on average, the dynamic flexibility of the sites substituted from CoV-1 to CoV-2 changes significantly less than the average calculated across all residues within the structure, indicating that the differences in behaviors between the two systems is likely the result of allosteric influence, where the new substitutions in COV-2 induce flexibility and dynamical changes elsewhere in the structure. SIGNIFICANCE Here we have conducted a comparative analysis between the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 mPro systems to shed mechanistic insight on the biophysical changes associated with the mutations between these two enzymes. Our work shows that the CoV-2 mPro system exhibits enhanced cross-chain communication between catalytic site residues and the rest of the structure. Further, both dynamic coupling and dynamic flexibility analyses indicates that, largely, the dynamic changes as evaluated by DCI and DFI occur at sites other than the mutation sites themselves, indicating that the functional differences between these two proteins are a result of dynamic allostery","Campitelli, P.; Lu, J.; Ozkan, S.

However, patients with CTD-ILD have required particular attention during the pandemic since they are at high risk due to immunosuppressive treatments. Thus, prompt decisions for diagnosis and treatment initiation have become more important than earlier for these patients during the pandemic. Radiological perspectives have become inevitable for the differential diagnosis of this group during the pandemic, particularly to obtain rapid and accurate results that allow the physicians to start treatment immediately. However, in addition to radiological images, a definitive diagnosis also requires access to extensive information regarding patient history, including characteristics of comorbidities, and clinical and serological findings. Consequently, the differential diagnosis of COVID-19 and CTD-ILD can yield accurate treatment regimens that differ greatly between the 2 diseases, and also prevent the spread of the outbreak with COVID-19 patients treated under isolation. © 2021, AVES.

Country-, state/region- and possibly even city-private variant profiles may contribute to varied disease exemplifications and fatality rates observed across the globe along with host factors such as age, ethnicity and comorbidity. The Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA) COVID-19 Analysis Research Database (CARD) captures up-to-date fulllength SARS-CoV-2 sequences of ~50,500 isolates from GISAID, GenBank, CHLA Center for Personalized Medicine, and other sources (as of June 18, 2020). Among which, 49,637 isolates carry at least one variation from the reference genome NC_045512, a total of 6,070 variants and 2,513 haplotypes were detected in at least three isolates independently. Together, they constituted the most likely SARS-CoV-2 variant and haplotype landscapes world-wide currently. Evidence supporting positive (orf3a, orf8, S genes) and purifying (M gene) selections were detected, which warrants further investigation. Most interestingly, we identified 1,583 countryprivate variants from 10,238 isolates (20.6% overall) reported in 48 countries. 807 countryprivate haplotypes, defined as a haplotype shared by at least 5 isolates all of which came from the same country, were identified in in 8,656 isolates from 39 countries. United Kingdom, USA, and Australia had 464, 166 and 32 private haplotypes respectively, comprising 22.4%, 16.6% and 16.4% of the isolates from each country. Together with their descendent and private haplotypes with fewer members, 22,171 (45.8%) isolates carried country-private haplotypes globally. The percentage were 28.2-29.6% in January to March, and rapidly increased to 46.4% and 59.6% in April and May, co-occurring with global travel restrictions. The localization of the variant profiles appeared to be similarly accelerating from 14.2% in March and 28.4% in April to over 40% isolates carrying the country-private variants around May. In summary, a common pattern is seen world-wide in COVID-19 in which at the onset of disease there appeared to be a significant number of SARS-CoV-2 variants that accumulate quickly and then begin to rapidly coalesce into distinct haplotypes. This may be the result of localized outbreaks due to factors such as multiple points viral introduction, geographic separation and the introduction of policies such as travel restriction, social distancing and quarantine, resulting in the emergence of country-private haplotypes.","Shen, Lishuang; Bard, Jennifer Dien; Biegel, Jaclyn A.; Judkins, Alexander R.; Gai, Xiaowu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.09.193722,636

Objective: To explore use of electronic health record (EHR) data to inform an administrative data algorithm for classification of supplemental oxygen or noninvasive ventilation (O2/NIV) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) to assess disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Design: In this retrospective cohort study, we developed an initial procedure-based algorithm to identify O2/NIV, IMV, and NEITHER O2/NIV nor IMV in two inpatient RWD sources. We then expanded the algorithm to explore the impact of adding diagnoses indicative of clinical need for O2/NIV (hypoxia, hypoxemia) or IMV (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and O2-related patient vitals available in the EHR. Observed changes in severity categorization were used to augment the administrative algorithm. Setting: Optum de-identified COVID-19 EHR data and HealthVerity claims and chargemaster data (March - August 2020). Participants: Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in each RWD source, our motivating example selected dexamethasone (DEX+) initiators and a random selection of patients who were non-initiators of a corticosteroid of interest (CSI-) matched on date of DEX initiation, age, sex, baseline comorbidity score, days since admission, and COVID-19 severity level (NEITHER, O2/NIV, IMV) on treatment index. Main Outcome and Measures: Inpatient COVID-19 severity was defined using the algorithms developed to classify respiratory support requirements among hospitalized COVID-19 patients (NEITHER, O2/NIV, IMV). Measures were reported as the treatment-specific distributions of patients in each severity level, and as observed changes in severity categorization between the initial procedure-based and expanded algorithms. Results: In the administrative data cohort with 5,524 DEX+ and CSI- patient pairs matched using the initial procedure-based algorithm, 30% were categorized as O2/NIV, 5% as IMV, and 65% as NEITHER. Among patients assigned NEITHER via the initial algorithm, use of an expanded algorithm informed by the EHR-based algorithm shifted 54% DEX+ and 28% CSI- to O2/NIV, and 2% DEX+ and 1% CSI- to IMV. Among patients initially assigned O2/NIV, 7% DEX+ and 3% CSI- shifted to IMV. Conclusions and Relevance: Application of learnings from an EHR-based exploration to our administrative algorithm minimized treatment-differential misclassification of COVID-19 severity.","Garry, E.

To contain the outbreak, a rapid and adequate emergency response was vital to control emergent public health risks, but emergency management was challenged by large uncertainty due to many unknowns about crucial determinants of the outbreak, determining the effectiveness of the response, which was often derived from uncertain information. This paper aims to draw lessons from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and it presents a review of strategies for emergency response pursued in eight European countries, including tipping points that triggered strategy shifts in emergency response. The paper shows that: (i) these countries have a culturally determined preference for policy response style (Mediterranean, continental and liberal style) depending on their relative scores on power distance and uncertainty avoidance, which (ii) is reflected in the initially adopted control paradigm and the associated strategy;(iii) Mediterranean countries (Italy, France, Spain) with high levels of power distance and uncertainty avoidance have a tendency to respond to new unknown situations by deploying strong rule-based regulatory systems which offer mental security and social order, whereas continental (Germany and Austria) and liberal countries (the Netherlands, the UK and Sweden) do this to medium and much lower extents.","van der Voorn, Tom de Jong Martin",COVID,https://doi.org/10.3390/covid1010005,636

It has been noted that human behavioral traits in disease avoidance are under selection in the presence of infectious diseases. Here we explore a complimentary trend: the pathogen itself might experience a force of selection to become less “visible”, or less “symptomatic”, in the presence of such human behavioral trends. Using a stochastic SIR agent-based model, we investigated the co-evolution of two viral strains with cross-immunity, where the resident strain is symptomatic while the mutant strain is asymptomatic. We assumed that individuals exercised self-regulated social distancing (SD) behavior if one of their neighbors was infected with a symptomatic strain. We observed that the proportion of asymptomatic carriers increased over time with a stronger effect corresponding to higher levels of self-regulated SD. Adding mandated SD made the effect more significant, while the existence of a time-delay between the onset of infection and the change of behavior reduced the advantage of the asymptomatic strain. These results were consistent under random geometric networks, scale-free networks, and a synthetic network that represented the social behavior of the residents of New Orleans.","Azizi, Asma; Komarova, Natalia L.; Wodarz, Dominik",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.09.459585,636

Small-scale fisheries are difficult to study and regulate, especially in countries with no systematic species monitoring. It is even more difficult to estimate the influence of these fisheries on vulnerable fish species and to diagnose possible damage to local fish populations. In this study, 490 individuals of badejo, or comb grouper (Mycteropeca acutirostris), were observed at the Posto 6 fishery in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro, for the periods of 2013-2014 and 2018-2020. A pattern of decreasing catches was observed for comb grouper. Therefore, provided that the fishing gear and the number of fish have remained the same, the apparent decrease in comb grouper needs to be further investigated. The results provide information regarding the reproduction of comb grouper, with major spawning season around spring (September-December) and additional spawning during April in SE Brazil. Samples from 96 groupers along the coast of Brazil were obtained, and genetic analyses were conducted. The genetic information obtained for grouper species enabled us to determine the relative genetic proximity of M. acutirostris and Mycteroperca bonaci and to obtain information that can be useful for aquaculture and conservation.","Begossi, Alpina; Salivonchyk, Svetlana; Glamuzina, Branko; Alves-Pereira, Alessandro; Araújo Batista, Carlos Eduardo De; Priolli, Regina H.

Here, we used flow cytometry to assess the magnitude, function, and phenotype of SARS coronavirus 2-specific (SARS-CoV-2-specific) CD4· T cells in 95 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 38 of them being HIV-1 and/or tuberculosis (TB) coinfected, and 38 non-COVID-19 patients. We showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4· T cell attributes, rather than magnitude, were associated with disease severity, with severe disease being characterized by poor polyfunctional potential, reduced proliferation capacity, and enhanced HLA-DR expression. Moreover, HIV-1 and TB coinfection skewed the SARS-CoV-2 T cell response. HIV-1-mediated CD4· T cell depletion associated with suboptimal T cell and humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, and a decrease in the polyfunctional capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4· T cells was observed in COVID-19 patients with active TB. Our results also revealed that COVID-19 patients displayed reduced frequency of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific CD4· T cells, with possible implications for TB disease progression. These results corroborate the important role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in COVID-19 pathogenesis and support the concept of altered T cell functions in patients with severe disease.","Riou, Catherine Du bruyn Elsa Stek Cari Daroowala Remy Goliath Rene T.; Abrahams, Fatima Said-Hartley Qonita Allwood Brian W.; Hsiao, Nei-Yuan Wilkinson Katalin A.; Arlehamn, Cecilia S.

Psychiatric nursing staff have minimal physical health experience;rarely will they need to employ strict infection control procedures. Knowing the high risk of mortality of our patients, we reacted to reduce transmission while maintaining high care standards in the least restrictive manner.We changed the functioning of the ward to reduce transmission. Formerly split into a male and female ward, we instigated a mixed-gender 4 ‘pod’ system. A step-wise model of confirmed, suspected, step-down and negative cases was developed. We held educational sessions on virology and handwashing to create understanding of why PPE is essential. Regular meetings brought together evidence and opinion with the MDT. From the onset, we followed WHO advice on 14 days isolation in contrast to our Trust’s policy of 7 days. This example of leadership lead to reduced transmission and mortality. We kept a high index of suspicion and low threshold for testing.12 out of 21 patients acquired COVID-19;3 died.

178536,Excess mortality analysis for Germany for all three COVID-19 waves in 2020 - 2021,2021-07-08,"Effective broad-spectrum antivirals are critical to prevent and control emerging human coronavirus (hCoV) infections. Despite considerable progress made towards identifying and evaluating several synthetic broad-spectrum antivirals against hCoV infections, a narrow therapeutic window has limited their success. Enhancing the endogenous interferon (IFN) and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) response is another antiviral strategy known for decades. However, the side effects of pegylated type-I IFNs (IFN-Is) and the pro-inflammatory response detected after delayed IFN-I therapy have discouraged their clinical use. In contrast to IFN-Is, IFN-λ, a dominant IFN at the epithelial surface, is shown to be less pro-inflammatory. Consequently, we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of IFN-λ in hCoV infected airway epithelial cells and mice. Human primary airway epithelial cells treated with a single dose of IFN-I (IFN-α) and IFN-λ showed similar ISG expression, whereas cells treated with two doses of IFN-λ expressed elevated levels of ISG compared to IFN-a treated cells. Similarly, mice treated with two dose IFN-λ were better protected compared to mice receiving a single dose, and a combination of prophylactic and delayed therapeutic regimens completely protected mice from lethal MERS-CoV-infection. A two dose IFN-λ regimen significantly reduced lung viral RNA and inflammatory cytokine levels with marked improvement in lung inflammation. Collectively, we identify an ideal regimen for IFN-λ use and demonstrate the protective efficacy of IFN-λ in MERS-CoV infected mice.","Dijkman, Ronald; Selvaraj, Muneeswaran; Gad, Hans Hendrik; Hartmann, Rune; More, Sunil; Perlman, Stanley; Thiel, Volker; Channappanavar, Rudragouda",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.26.445685,636

179046,Physical activity as protective factor against COVID-19 disease,2020,"Background/Introduction Untreated, symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis carries significant mortality and morbidity. Timely intervention is pivotal to ensure patient safety. The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges to the UK's National Health Service (NHS), resulting in the deferral of all elective work, including TAVI services from March 2020. We sought to evaluate clinical outcomes and time delays in patients undergoing TAVI during the pandemic period compared to an age and risk factor-matched cohort of patients prior to COVID-19. We hypothesized that there were significant time delays, more emergency procedures and related adverse outcomes in patients who underwent TAVI during the pandemic period. Methods We analysed prospectively collected data (patient characteristics, procedural details, complications and in-hospital outcomes) of 210 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI between March 2019 and February 2021 in a tertiary centre in the UK (The centre serves for a population of 2.5 million and provided in-patient treatment for 5590 COVID-positive patients over a 12-month period). We compared time-lags from an initial referral to outpatient review, CT aortograms, MDT discussions, valve implantations and 30-day mortality between patients who underwent TAVI between March 2019 and February 2020 (Control group=134) and those who underwent TAVI between March 2020 and February 2021 (COVID Group=76). Results The mean age of the cohort was 81.9 ±6.4 years compared to 80.9±6.9 in the COVID-19 group. 59% of the control group and 43% of the COVID-19 group were female. Majority were in the moderate risk category (EuroSCORE II=4.55±5.5). Mean Katz index in the control group was 5.4 ±0.9 and 5.7±0.5 in the COVID-19 cohort. Patient characteristics are summarised in table 1. Of the total cohort, 4 (5.3%) patients acquired COVID-19 pneumonia during the hospital stay. The comorbidities and risk scores were comparable between the control group and the COVID cohort. (Table 1). There were no significant differences in procedural complications in the control group compared to the COVID-19 group (table 2). The median waiting time from referral to TAVI clinic was significantly shorter in the COVID-19 group (33 (8-66) vs. 51(17-89) days (P=0.04)) and there was no significant difference in time delays for CT aortogram, MDT or TAVI procedure between the two groups (Figure 1). The median length of stay (2 (2-4) vs 2.5(2-9) days) and 30-day mortality (1.4% vs 5.3%) was comparable between the two groups. Conclusion Contrary to our hypothesis, our analysis demonstrated that there were no significant time delays, excess complications or mortality in TAVI procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic period despite the excess burden imposed on our local health services. More importantly, very few TAVI patients acquired COVID-19 sepsis during in-hospital stay. This is likely due to prompt identification of innovative ways of re-configuring an existing local patient pathway, by the TAVI team, to deliver safe and uninterrupted TAVI services during this unprecedented pandemic setting.","Tan, J.; Teoh, T.

Triggered during the so-called “fight-or-flight” response, the activation of the β-adrenergic receptors located on the cardiomyocyte membrane initiates a phosphorylation cascade of multiple ion channel targets that regulate both cellular excitability and recovery and of different proteins involved in intracellular calcium handling. As a result, β-ARS impacts both the electrophysiological and the mechanical response of the cardiomyocyte. β-ARS also plays a crucial role in several cardiac pathologies, greatly modifying cardiac output and potentially causing arrhythmogenic events. Mathematical patient-specific models are nowadays envisioned as an important tool for the personalised study of cardiac disease, the design of tailored treatments, or to inform risk assessment. Despite that, only a reduced number of computational studies of heart disease have incorporated β-ARS modelling. In this review, we describe the main existing multiscale frameworks to equip cellular models of cardiac electrophysiology with a β-ARS response. We also outline various applications of these multiscale frameworks in the study of cardiac pathology. We end with a discussion of the main current limitations and the future steps that need to be taken to adapt these models to a clinical environment and to incorporate them in organ-level simulations.","Doste, Ruben",Mathematics,https://doi.org/10.3390/math9151785,636

Structured and pretested short questionnaires were employed to obtain information electronically and physically across the six geopolitical zones on socio-demographic characteristics of participants;the knowledge of participants on COVID-19 disease;availability and accessibility to testing and isolation centers in the communities, attitudes and health seeking behaviors. Atotal of 1023 respondents;705 (68.9%) males and 318 (31.1%) females across the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria participated in this study with 477(46.6%) within the 26-45 years age category, and 6(0.6%) above 66 years. Atotal of 985(96.3%) had heard about COVID-19 at the time of survey while a total of 859(84.0%) of the respondents were aware of the presence of COVID-19 laboratory testing centers. Across the geopolitical zones, majority of the respondents 487(47.6%) claimed there are no routine testing for COVID-19 at their community level, while 303 (29.6%) affirmed otherwise and 216(21.1%) did not know if there were routine testing going on or not.

Recent clinical data indicate higher complication rates with HCQ/AZM combination treatment in comparison to monotherapy. Here, we used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) to systematically investigate the effects of HCQ and AZM individually and in combination. The clinically observed QT prolongation caused by treatment with HCQ could be recapitulated in iPSC-CMs based on prolonged field potential duration (FPDc). Interestingly, HCQ-induced FPDc prolongation was strongly enhanced by combined treatment with AZM, although AZM alone slightly shortened FPDc in iPSC-CMs. Furthermore, combined treatment with AZM and HCQ leads to higher cardiotoxicity, more severe structural disarrangement, and more pronounced contractile and electrophysiological dysfunctions, compared to respective mono-treatments. First mechanistic insights underlying the synergistic effects of AZM and HCQ on iPSC-CM functionality are provided based on increased Cx43- and Nav1.5-protein levels. Taken together, our results highlight that combined treatment with HCQ and AZM strongly enhances the adverse effects on cardiomyocytes, providing mechanistic evidence for the high mortality in patients receiving HCQ/AZM combination treatment.","Li, Wener; Luo, Xiaojing; Poetsch, Mareike S.; Oertel, Reinhard; Nichani, Kapil; Schneider, Martin; Strano, Anna; Hasse, Marcel; Steiner, Robert-Patrick; Cyganek, Lukas; Hettwer, Karina; Uhlig, Steffen; Simon, Kirsten; Guan, Kaomei; Schubert, Mario",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.19.456950,636

The ensuing public health crisis has placed aspects of this relationship in harsh relief;perceptions of scientific credibility, risk, uncertainty, and democracy are all publicly debated in ways unforeseen before the pandemic. This unprecedented situation presents opportunities to reassess how certain disciplines contribute to the public understanding of science. Space education has long provided a lens through which people can consider the intersection of the natural world with society. Space science is critical to understanding how human activity and pollution affect global warming, which in turn, inextricably links it to perceptions of the natural world, environmental change, science communication, and public engagement. The pandemic has caused a dramatic shift in how space education projects connect with public audiences, with participation pivoting to online engagement. This transition, coupled with the renewed societal examination of trust in science, means that it is an ideal time for the field of space education to reflect on its development. Whether it evolves into its own distinct field, or remains an area that straddles disciplinary boundaries, such as science education, communication, and public engagement, are crucial considerations when scientific trust, accountability, and responsibility are in question.

181425,BI08: Remote management of immunotherapy‐induced bullous pemphigoid during the COVID‐19 pandemic,2021,"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: There have been widespread concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions on children's and adolescents' mental health. While some studies have found increasing rates of mental health problems during the pandemic, other evidence suggest that mental symptoms and disorders were increasing before the pandemic. This study compared trends in mental healthcare use during the first 15 months of the pandemic with similar pre-pandemic trends. METHODS: Consultations related to mental symptoms and disorders were identified through national registries from primary and specialist healthcare services, including hospitalizations, covering the entire population of children 6-18 years in Norway (N=908 272). The monthly likelihood of having a consultation or hospitalization related to overall mental health problems, and specific diagnoses for depression, anxiety, ADHD and sleep problems were plotted from January 2020 to May 2021 and compared to trends over the same period between 2017-2019 using event study and difference-in-difference designs. FINDINGS: We found reductions in consultations for mental health symptoms and disorders in primary and specialist healthcare during the first weeks of lockdown in 2020. This decline was temporary, and volumes of consultations quickly returned to pre-pandemic levels. However, during fall 2020, consultation volumes related to mental health in primary care increased. This increase persisted into the winter of 2021 but levelled off by the last month of the sample period. The increase in consultation volumes was about 50 % compared to the pre-pandemic period. We did not find increases in consultations in specialist healthcare, except for hospitalizations. CONCLUSION: We found an increase in primary care consultation volumes related to mental health among children that depart from the previously established increases over recent years. We did not see similar increases in consultations in the specialist healthcare. It is unknown whether increases in primary care consultations represent milder cases, which primarily do not need specialist treatment, or if the stability in specialist healthcare consultations reflects capacity problems or timelags in referrals.","Evensen, M.; Hart, R.

We examined the transport of aerosols similar in size to human respiratory aerosols (0.3m-10m) in representative locations, such as high-traffic areas and restrooms. In restrooms, the observed decay of aerosol concentrations was consistent with well-mixed air exchange. In all other locations, fast decay times were measured, which were found to be independent of aerosol size (typically a few minutes). From this, we conclude that in the main retail areas, including at checkouts, rapid turbulent mixing and advection is the dominant feature in aerosol dynamics. With this, the upper bound of risk for airborne disease transmission to a susceptible is determined by direct exposure to the exhalation cloud of an infectious. For the example of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we find when speaking without a face mask and aerosol sizes up to an exhalation (wet) diameter of 50m, a distance of 1.5me to be unsafe. However, at the smallest distance between an infectious and a susceptible, while wearing typical surgical masks and for all sizes of exhaled aerosol, the upper bound of infection risk is only [~] 5% and decreases further by a factor of 100 ([~] 0.05%) for typical FFP2 masks for a duration of 20 min. This upper bound is very conservative and we expect the actual risk for typical encounters to be much lower.

Being explicit about the runtime environment and any use of software containers enables portability and reuse. Workflows written according to the CWL standards are a reusable description of that analysis that are runnable on a diverse set of computing environments. These descriptions contain enough information for advanced optimization without additional input from workflow authors. The CWL standards support polylingual workflows, enabling portability and reuse of such workflows, easing for example scholarly publication, fulfilling regulatory requirements, collaboration in/between academic research and industry, while reducing implementation costs.

One important question that remains is whether the protection conferred by vaccines wanes over time. However, estimates over time are subject to bias from differential depletion of susceptibles between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. Here we examine the extent to which biases occur under different scenarios and assess whether serologic testing has the potential to correct this bias. By identifying non-vaccine antibodies, these tests could identify individuals with prior infection. We find that the main determinant of bias is the proportion of the population that has been infected since vaccination began, which is influenced by several factors. In scenarios with high baseline VE, differential depletion of susceptibles creates minimal bias in VE estimates. However, if VE is lower, the bias for leaky vaccines (that reduce individual probability of infection given contact) is larger and should be corrected if the mechanism is known to be leaky. Conducting analyses both unadjusted and adjusted for past infection could give lower and upper bounds for the true VE. Studies of VE should therefore enroll individuals regardless of prior infection history but also collect information, ideally through serologic testing, on this critical variable.","Kahn, R.; Schrag, S.

According to the RBCI analysis, the ligands with the highest affinity against 4 enzymes in the molecular docking study were determined as 1-caffeoyl-β-D-glucose, rosmarinic acid, 3-p-coumaroylquinic acid and chlorogenic acid. It has also been observed that these compounds interacted more strongly with spike RBD, CatB and CatL enzymes. Although the top-ranked ligand, 1-caffeoyl-β-D-glucose, violated the drug-likeness criteria at 1 point (NH or OH>5) and ADMET in terms of AMES toxicity, the second top-ranked ligand rosmarinic acid neither violated drug-likeness nor exhibited incompatibility in terms of ADMET. In conclusion, with its anti-inflammatory properties, rosmarinic acid can be considered and further investigated as a plant-based pharmaceutical that can offer a treatment option in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In this study, a multifaceted genomics approach was applied to analyze the impact of differential expression of glycosyltransferases (GTs) in 16 cancers. An enzyme list was compiled and curated from numerous resources to create a consensus set of GTs. Resulting enzymes were analyzed for differential expression in cancer, and findings were integrated with experimental evidence from other analyses, including: similarity of healthy expression patterns across orthologous genes, miRNA expression, automatically-mined literature, curation of known cancer biomarkers, N-glycosylation impact, and survival analysis. The resulting list of GTs comprises 222 human enzymes based on annotations from five databases, 84 of which were differentially expressed in more than five cancers, and 14 of which were observed with the same direction of expression change across all implicated cancers. 25 high-value GT candidates were identified by cross-referencing multimodal analysis results, including PYGM, FUT6 and additional fucosyltransferases, several UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and others, and are suggested for prioritization in future cancer biomarker studies. Relevant findings are available through OncoMX at https://data.oncomx.org, and the overarching pipeline can be used as a framework for similarly analysis across diverse evidence types in cancer. This work is expected to improve the understanding of glycosylation in cancer by transparently defining the space of glycosyltransferase enzymes and harmonizing variable experimental data to enable improved generation of data-driven cancer biomarker hypotheses.","Dingerdissen, Hayley M; Vora, Jeet; Cauley, Edmund; Bell, Amanda; King, Charles Hadley; Mazumder, Raja",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.15.448506,636

184777,Is the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic an Indication to Temporarily Modify Dermatological Management Plans?,2020-04-01,"Although numerous promising therapeutic targets for human diseases have been discovered, most have not been successfully translated into clinical practice1. A bottleneck in the application of basic research findings to patients is the enormous cost, time, and effort required for high-throughput screening of potential drugs2 for given therapeutic targets. Recent advances in 3D docking simulations have not solved this problem, given that 3D protein structures with sufficient resolution are not always available and that they are computationally expensive to obtain. Here we have developed LIGHTHOUSE, a graph-based deep learning approach for discovery of the hidden principles underlying the association of small-molecule compounds with target proteins, and we present its validation by identifying potential therapeutic compounds for various human diseases. Without any 3D structural information for proteins or chemicals, LIGHTHOUSE estimates protein-compound scores that incorporate known evolutionary relations and available experimental data. It identified novel therapeutics for cancer, lifestyle-related disease, and bacterial infection. Moreover, LIGHTHOUSE predicted ethoxzolamide as a therapeutic for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and this agent was indeed effective against alpha, beta, gamma, and delta variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that are rampant worldwide. Given that ethoxzolamide is already approved for several diseases, it could be rapidly deployed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. We envision that LIGHTHOUSE will bring about a paradigm shift in translational medicine, providing a bridge from bench side to bedside.","Shimizu, Hideyuki; Kodama, Manabu; Matsumoto, Masaki; Orba, Yasuko; Sasaki, Michihito; Sato, Akihiko; Sawa, Hirofumi; Nakayama, Keiichi I.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.25.461785,636

There is a need for such challenges to inform educational and training programs, for them to enable skill development from a holistic viewpoint. Yet, most of the educational programs seem to be technological or subject-based, i.e. not skilled-based. There is an opportunity for a new approach to support and create educational programs and training for both university graduates and industry workers. This paper presents a human-centric model based on competences, age groups, and environment scenarios. The proposal supports the development of more robust means to look at educational gaps by visualizing and adapting a competency-based scenario. The aim is to provide a novel approach that is holistic, inclusive, and flexible in better preparing the future workforce.","Flores, Emmanuel; Xu, Xun; Lu, Yuqian",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920316024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920316024,636

METHODS: Three microliters of dispase at a concentration of 0.2 U/μl were injected into the vitreal cavities of 4–6-week-old mice. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunofluorescence analysis, and electroretinograms of the eyes were then performed to assess ocular changes, and enzyme-linked immunospot assays and intracellular staining of single-cell suspensions of the spleens were used to detect immune changes during an 8 week observation period. RESULTS: Neutrophils were the main inflammatory infiltrating cells appearing at the anterior chamber. No cluster of differentiation (CD)3+ labeled T cells, F4/80+ labeled macrophages, or CD56+ labeled natural killer cells were found in the vitreal cavities or retinas in dispase-injected mice within 5 days after injection. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR)-like signs first appeared at 2 weeks, gradually increased thereafter, and reached peak values at 8 weeks. There was a statistically significant difference in b-wave amplitudes between the PVR and saline-control eyes. Enzyme-linked immunospot assays and intracellular staining showed that specific CD4+ and CD8+ labeled T cells were not involved in dispase-injected mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that neutrophils in the anterior chamber and PVR-like signs in the retinas were found, and that specific immune reactions were not involved after intravitreal dispase injection in mice.","Tan, Juan; Liu, Yaqin; Li, Wei; Gao, Qianying",Mol Vis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3327440/,636

187317,"Fear, Preparedness and Covid-19.",2020-05-01,"OBJECTIVE Patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) subsequent to embolization suffer from elevated local failure rates and differences in adverse radiation effects. Onyx is a common embolic material for AVMs. Onyx is formulated with tantalum, a high atomic number (Z = 73) element that has been investigated as a source of dosimetric uncertainty contributing to the less favorable clinical results. However, prior studies have not modeled the complicated anatomical and beam geometries characteristic of GKRS. This study investigated the magnitude of dose perturbation that can occur due to Onyx embolization using clinically realistic anatomical and Gamma Knife beam models. METHODS Leksell GammaPlan (LGP) was used to segment the AVM nidus and areas of Onyx from postcontrast stereotactic MRI for 7 patients treated with GKRS postembolization. The resulting contours, skull surface, and clinically selected dose distributions were exported from LGP in DICOM-RT (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine-radiotherapy) format. Isocenter locations and dwell times were recorded from the LGP database. Contours were converted into 3D mesh representations using commercial and in-house mesh-editing software. The resulting data were imported into a Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation engine (Pegasos, Elekta Instruments AB) with a beam geometry for the Gamma Knife Perfexion. The MC-predicted dose distributions were calculated with Onyx assigned manufacturer-reported physical constants (MC-Onyx), and then compared with corresponding distributions in which Onyx was reassigned constants for water (MC-water). Differences in dose metrics were determined, including minimum, maximum, and mean dose to the AVM nidus; selectivity index; and target coverage. Combined differences in dose magnitude and distance to agreement were calculated as 3D Gamma analysis passing rates using tolerance criteria of 0.5%/0.5 mm, 1.0%/1.0 mm, and 3.0%/3.0 mm. RESULTS Overall, the mean percentage differences in dose metrics for MC-Onyx relative to MC-water were as follows; all data are reported as mean (SD): minimum dose to AVM = -0.7% (1.4%), mean dose to AVM = 0.1% (0.2%), maximum dose to AVM = 2.9% (5.0%), selectivity = 0.1% (0.2%), and coverage = -0.0% (0.2%). The mean percentage of voxels passing at each Gamma tolerance were as follows: 99.7% (0.1%) for 3.0%/3.0 mm, 98.2% (0.7%) for 1.0%/1.0 mm, and 52.1% (4.4%) for 0.5%/0.5 mm. CONCLUSIONS Onyx embolization appears to have a detectable effect on the delivered dose distribution. However, the small changes in dose metrics and high Gamma passing rates at 1.0%/1.0 mm tolerance suggest that these changes are unlikely to be clinically significant. Additional sources of delivery and biological uncertainty should be investigated to determine the root cause of the observed less favorable postembolization GKRS outcomes.","Schlesinger, David J; Nordström, Håkan; Lundin, Anders; Xu, Zhiyuan; Sheehan, Jason P",Journal of neurosurgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27903195/,636

METHODS This prospective observational study was conducted in the ED of National Taiwan University Hospital from January 2002 to January 2007. The daily ED patient numbers of different triage levels in different service specialties were collected and correlated with the daily average temperature (T) and change in temperature (deltaT) compared with the previous day. A univariate analysis was performed with the Pearson correlation and a multivariate analysis with multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS A total of 505,224 patient visits were included in this study. On univariate analysis, there was no significant correlation between T and the ED volume (r = 0.012, p = 0.608), but there was a significant correlation between deltaT and ED volume (r = 0.109, p<0.001). On multivariate analysis, deltaT and holidays were identified as independent predictors of ED volume. We established the following formula in predicting the ED patient number: y = 265.42 + (0.06 x T) + (2.57 x deltaT) + (59.77 x holiday). There was a positive association between T and the trauma patient number, while there was a negative association between T and medical and paediatric patient numbers. On the triage level, a low T was associated with increased patient triage level, while no significant association was noted between deltaT and the proportion in any triage level. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that ambient temperature had differential effects on ED patient visits of different specialties and severities.","Tai, Chia-Chun; Lee, Chien-Chang; Shih, Chung-Liang; Chen, Shyr-Chyr",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17711942/,636

This paper reviews PHPM training and employment in Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the USA. METHODS Information gathered from relevant accreditation bodies and literature searches was used to create descriptive profiles of national training demographics and structure and a narrative outlining trends and challenges facing the specialty. RESULTS Notable similarities and differences exist between national contexts. Key themes were differences in training strategies and practice scope, specialty stakeholders, certification structure, and funding. Recognition challenges faced the specialty across all six countries. Other challenges included unclear competencies and training strategies and a need for PHPM specialists to highlight their role in combating population health threats. Additional differences existed between comparator countries on the structure of training, funding sources for training programs, availability of training posts, and linkages with other physician specialties. CONCLUSION Highlighting these themes is a first step to fostering training collaborations between PHPM specialist physicians to augment transnational action on global public health challenges and also supports PHPM physician educators with innovative solutions from abroad that might address domestic specialty challenges.","Peik, Samuel M; Mohan, Keerthi M; Baba, Toshiaki; Donadel, Morgane; Labruto, Andrea; Loh, Lawrence C",Medical teacher,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27093229/,636

Discussed are the implications that such a pandemic may have on transplant patients. Logical inferences can be made from data on influenza in transplant patients and from experience with other respiratory virus outbreaks. In the event of a pandemic, it is likely that transplant patients will have more severe disease and higher mortality as compared to the general population. Vaccination and antiviral strategies may be less effective in this population.

Background COVID-19 has now spread throughout world. There is a serious need to find potential therapeutic agents. The 3C-like protease (Mpro/6LU7) is an attractive molecular target for rational anti-CoV drugs. Methods The tertiary structure of COVID-19 Mpro was obtained from a protein data bank repository, and molecular docking screening was performed by Molegro Virtual Docker, ver. 6, with a grid resolution of 0.30 Å. Docking scores (DOS) are representative of calculated ligand-receptor (protein) interaction energy; therefore, more negative scores mean better binding tendency. Another docking study was then applied on each of the selected drugs with the best ligands separately and using a more accurate RMSD algorithm. Results The docking of COVID-19 major protease (6LU7) with 17 selected drugs resulted in four FDA approved viral antiprotease drugs (Temoporfin, Simeprevir, Cobicistat, Ritonavir) showing the best docking scores. Among these 4 compounds, Temoporfin exhibited the best DOS (-202.88) and the best screened ligand with COVID-19 Mpro, followed by Simeprevir (-201.66), Cobicistat (-187.75), and Ritonavir (-186.66). As the best screened ligand, Temoporfin could target the Mpro with 20 different conformations, while Simeprevir, Cobicistat, and Ritonavir make 14, 10, and 10 potential conformations at the binding site, respectively. Conclusion The findings showed that the four selected FDA approved drugs can be potent inhibitors against COVID-19; among them, Temoporfin may be more potent for the treatment of the disease.

The water loss is entirely from the extracellular space. In severe cases, hypovolemic shock occurs with the blood volume decreased by as much as one-half. Acidosis, which results from fecal bicarbonate loss, lactic acidosis, and renal dysfunction, results in tissue buffering, which in turn causes the efflux of cellular potassium ions. Although there is a total body potassium deficit, plasma potassium concentration is increased. This, in conjunction with an intracellular deficit, causes weakness, lethargy, and potassium cardiotoxicosis resulting in death. Hypoglycemia also contributes to the weakness and lethargy seem as calves become moribund. These losses from the body and shifts in fluids and electrolytes must be understood to develop the most effective rationale for supportive therapy.","Lewis, L D; Phillips, R W",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/212408/,636

Tissue sealers as employed in laparoscopic surgery have not been previously used for Zenker's diverticulum septotomy.Supported by the established safety of linear cutters, bipolar forceps, and ultrasonic scalpels, we have started a procedure using the Ligasure 5™ tissue sealer. Safety and efficacy results in our early clinical experience are shown for a prospective series of 5 consecutive Zenker's diverticulum cases that were perorally managed with tissue sealing.The procedure was quickly and safely performed in the endoscopy room under sedation. Mean number of seals per patient was 2, and mean procedure duration was 33 minutes. No complications developed during or after the procedure, and patients were discharged with immediate dysphagia relief and adequate oral tolerance. No diverticular relapses occurred after a mean follow-up of 21 months (range 18-30). This procedure may be repeated as often as desired with no need for hospital admission. Safety should be prospectively assessed by further studies using a higher number of procedures.","Noguera-Aguilar, José; Dolz-Abadía, Carlos; Vilella, Angels; Muñoz-Pérez, José M; Canaval-Zuleta, Héctor Julián; Salvatierra-Arrieta, Leopoldo",Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852740/,636

199370,The impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on maternity care in Europe,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly emerged coronavirus (CoV) designated SARS-CoV. The virus utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the primary receptor. Although the idea is less clear and somewhat controversial, SARS-CoV is thought to use C-type lectins DC-SIGN and/or L-SIGN (collectively referred to as DC/L-SIGN) as alternative receptors or as enhancer factors that facilitate ACE2-mediated virus infection. In this study, the function of DC/L-SIGN in SARS-CoV infection was examined in detail. The results of our study clearly demonstrate that both proteins serve as receptors independently of ACE2 and that there is a minimal level of synergy between DC/L-SIGN and ACE2. As expected, glycans on spike (S) glycoprotein are important for DC/L-SIGN-mediated virus infection. Site-directed mutagenesis analyses have identified seven glycosylation sites on the S protein critical for DC/L-SIGN-mediated virus entry. They include asparagine residues at amino acid positions 109, 118, 119, 158, 227, 589, and 699, which are distinct from residues of the ACE2-binding domain (amino acids 318 to 510). Amino acid sequence analyses of S proteins encoded by viruses isolated from animals and humans suggest that glycosylation sites N227 and N699 have facilitated zoonotic transmission.","Han, Dong P; Lohani, Motashim; Cho, Michael W",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17715238/,636

METHODS A demographic approach with a counterfactual scenario in which nobody in NZ is born with FASD was used. Estimates were calculated using (Census Year) 2013 data for the NZ population, the labour force, unemployment rate and average weekly wage, all of which were obtained from Statistics NZ. In order to estimate the number of FASD cases in 2013 and the related morbidity, the prevalence of FASD, obtained from the available epidemiological literature, was applied to the general population of NZ. Assumptions made on the level of impairment that would affect the ability of individuals with FASD to participate in the workforce or would reduce their productivity were based on data obtained from the current epidemiological literature. RESULTS In 2013, approximately 0.03% of the NZ workforce experienced a loss of productivity due to FASD-attributable morbidity and premature mortality, which translated to aggregate losses ranging from $NZ49 million to $NZ200 million - that is, 0.03% to 0.09% of the annual gross domestic product in NZ. These costs represent estimates for lost productivity attributable to FASD and do not include additional costs incurred by governmental and private entities including social costs, such as both higher costs and or less effective spending by the education, health and justice systems. CONCLUSION The estimated productivity losses associated with FASD further reinforces that effective FASD prevention as a primary public health strategy may be of significant value.","Easton, Brian; Burd, Larry; Rehm, Jürgen; Popova, Svetlana",The New Zealand medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27538041/,636

199721,The Impact of COVID-19 on the Delivery of an Evidence-Based Child Maltreatment Prevention Program: Understanding the Perspectives of SafeCare® Providers,2020,"Murine coronavirus (MHV) and rat coronavirus (RCV) are antigenically related viruses that have different natural rodent hosts. Both MHV and RCV can be propagated in the L2(Percy) and CMT-93 mouse cell lines. In these cell lines MHV uses the MHV receptor (MHVR or Bgp1a) and several related murine Bgp glycoproteins in the immunoglobulin superfamily as receptors. To determine whether RCV also uses these murine glycoproteins as receptors, we characterized the envelope glycoproteins of two strains of RCV and compared the effects of anti-MHVR monoclonal antibody on susceptibility of the mouse cells to MHV and RCV. The Parker (RCV-P) and sialodacryoadenitis (RCV-SDAV) strains of RCV expressed the spike glycoprotein S, but only RCV-P expressed a hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein that had acetylesterase activity. Therefore RCV-SDAV must bind to cellular receptors by the viral S glycoprotein, whereas RCV-P might bind to cells by its hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein as well as by S. Pretreatment of L2(Percy) 41.a or CMT-93 cells with anti-MHVR monoclonal antibody blocked infection with MHV-A59 but did not prevent infection of these murine cells with RCV-P or RCV-SDAV. Baby hamster kidney cells transfected with cDNAs encoding MHVR (Bgp1a) or Bgp2 were susceptible to MHV-A59 but not to RCV-P or RCV-SDAV. Thus the RCV strains cannot use these murine coronavirus receptors and must be infecting murine cells by another, as yet unknown, receptor.","Gagneten, S; Scanga, C A; Dveksler, G S; Beauchemin, N; Percy, D; Holmes, K V",Laboratory animal science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8723231/,636

Nowadays, it represents a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, which may lead to the requirement of a mechanical ventilation in intensive care units and premature death. The increase in relative risk of poor prognosis in presence of obesity is particularly high in patients at a younger age. The underlying mechanisms are multiple: alteration of the respiratory performance, presence of frequent comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension or obstructive sleep apnea), finally inadequate and excessive immunological responses, with massive liberation of cytokines (especially interkeukin-1 and interleukin-6). Thus, COVID-19 may challenge the so-called «obesity paradox» in intensive care units among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome where obesity is commonly reported as associated with a better prognosis. In the special case of COVID-19, a condition where obviously obesity aggravates the prognosis, hypothetical mechanisms remain to be well-defined and deserve further validation.","De Flines, J; Scheen, A J",Revue medicale de Liege,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33211438/,636
200840,Impact Of Covid-19 On Vascular Education,2020,The subgenomic RNAs of the fowl coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) form a 3' co-terminal or 'nested' set. The presence of non-contiguous (leader) sequences fused to the 5' termini of murine hepatitis virus mRNAs has been demonstrated using RNase T1 oligonucleotide mapping and sequencing. The presence of a leader sequence on IBV mRNA A has been demonstrated previously. In this paper the presence of a leader identical to that present on the 5' terminus of IBV mRNA A is demonstrated to be present on the 5' terminus of IBV genomic RNA. This has been achieved by sequencing of primer extension products and cDNA clones containing the genomic leader. Analysis of these clones has revealed the presence of a sequence at the leader/genome-length RNA junction which is closely related to regions of homology identified previously within the genomic RNA sequence at the leader/body junctions of subgenomic RNAs.

201003,A multiple criteria approach for constructing a pandemic impact assessment composite indicator: The case of Covid-19 in Portugal,2021-09-24,"In early 2006, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 of the Asian lineage caused the death of wild aquatic birds in Northern Germany. In the mainly affected areas, a trans-species transmission of HPAIV H5N1 to mammals occurred between birds and domestic cats and 1 Stone Marten (Martes foina), respectively. Here, we report lesions and distribution of influenza virus antigen in 3 cats infected naturally with HPAIV H5N1 A/swan/Germany/R65/06. The hemagglutinin partial nucleotide sequences of the viruses were genetically closely related to a H5N1 HPAIV obtained from a dead Whooper Swan (Cygnus cygnus) of the same area. At necropsy, within the patchy dark-red and consolidated lungs, there was granulomatous pneumonia caused by Aelurostrongylus sp. Histologically, the main findings associated with influenza in all cats were bronchointerstitial pneumonia and marked random hepatic necrosis. In addition, all animals displayed lymphoid necrosis in the spleen and Peyer's patches and necrosis of the adrenal cortex. Immunohistochemically, nucleoprotein of HPAIV was present intralesionally in the lungs, liver, adrenal glands, and lymphoid tissues. Oropharyngeal swabs were shown to be suited to detect HPAIV by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in these cats, despite the paucity of influenza virus antigen in the upper respiratory tract by means of immunohistochemistry. The results show that outdoor cats in areas affected by HPAIV in wild birds are at risk for lethal infection. In conclusion, hepatic necrosis was, besides bronchointerstitial pneumonia, the primary lesion, suggesting that in naturally infected cats, damage to the liver plays an important role in the pathogenesis of H5N1 influenza.","Klopfleisch, R; Wolf, P U; Uhl, W; Gerst, S; Harder, T; Starick, E; Vahlenkamp, T W; Mettenleiter, T C; Teifke, J P",Veterinary pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17491066/,636

Serological immunoglobulin tests may help to better understand the development of immune mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 cases and exposed but asymptomatic individuals. The aim of this study was to investigate exposure to SARS-CoV-2, symptoms, and antibody responses in a large sample of healthcare workers following a COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A COVID-19 outbreak among staff members of a major German children's and women's hospital was followed by massive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests and provided the opportunity to study symptoms, chains of infection, and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses (IgG and IgA) by ELISA. Study participants were classified as COVID-19 cases, and persons with close, moderate, or no exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical setting, respectively. RESULTS: Out of 201 study participants, 31 were COVID-19 cases. While most study participants experienced many symptoms indicative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, anosmia and coughing were remarkably more frequent in COVID-19 cases. Approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases developed some specific antibody response (IgA and IgG) approximately 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Subjects in the non-COVID-19 groups had also elevated IgG (1.8%) and IgA values (7.6%) irrespective of contact history with cases. CONCLUSION: We found that a significant number of diseased did not develop relevant antibody responses three weeks after symptom onset. Our data also suggest that exposure to COVID-19 positive co-workers in a hospital setting is not leading to the development of measurable immune responses in a significant proportion of asymptomatic contact persons.","Brandstetter, Susanne; Roth, Samra; Harner, Susanne; Buntrock-Döpke, Heike; Toncheva, Antoaneta A; Borchers, Natascha; Gruber, Rudolf; Ambrosch, Andreas; Kabesch, Michael",Pediatr. allergy immunol,,636

To date no trial comparing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) has been performed. METHODS: Hospitalized patients &#8805;18 years old with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were treated with either HCQ or LPV/RTV if they had either respiratory insufficiency (SpO2â¯&#8804; 93% on room air or the need for oxygen insufflation) or bilateral consolidations on chest X­ray and at least 2 comorbidities associated with poor COVID-19 prognosis. Outcomes investigated included in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of stay, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) negativity and side effects of treatment. RESULTS: Of 156 patients (41% female) with a median age of 72 years (IQR 55.25-81) admitted to our department, 67 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (20 received HCQ, 47 LPV/RTV). Groups were comparable regarding most baseline characteristics. Median time from symptom onset to treatment initiation was 8 days and was similar between the groups (pâ¯= 0.727). There was no significant difference (HCQ vs. LPV/RTV) in hospital mortality (15% vs. 8.5%, pâ¯= 0.418), ICU admission rate (20% vs. 12.8%, pâ¯= 0.470) and length of stay (9 days vs. 11 days, pâ¯= 0.340). A PCR negativity from nasopharyngeal swabs was observed in approximately two thirds of patients in both groups. Side effects led to treatment discontinuation in 15% of patients in the LPV/RTV group. CONCLUSION: No statistically significant differences were observed in outcome parameters in patients treated with HCQ or LPV/RTV but patients in the LPV/RTV group showed a numerically lower hospital mortality rate. Additionally, in comparison to other studies we demonstrated a lower mortality in patients treated with LPV/RTV despite having similar patient groups, perhaps due to early initiation of treatment.","Karolyi, Mario; Pawelka, Erich; Mader, Theresa; Omid, Sara; Kelani, Hasan; Ely, Sarah; Jilma, Bernd; Baumgartner, Sebastian; Laferl, Hermann; Ott, Clemens; Traugott, Marianna; Turner, Michael; Seitz, Tamara; Wenisch, Christoph; Zoufaly, Alexander",Wien. klin.

However, significant differences in hospital conditions, as well as skepticism of doctors about machine learning algorithms, limit their introduction into clinical practice. Our goal was to test and apply the principle of ”patient-like-mine” decision support in rapidly changing conditions of a pandemic.MethodsIn the developed system we implemented a fuzzy search that allows a doctor to compare their medical case with similar cases recorded in their medical center since the beginning of the pandemic. Various distance metrics were tried for obtaining clinically relevant search results. With the use of R programming language, we designed the first version of the system in approximately a week. A set of features for the comparison of the cases was selected with the use of random forest algorithm implemented in Caret. Shiny package was chosen for the design of GUI.ResultsThe deployed tool allowed doctors to quickly estimate the current conditions of their patients by means of studying the most similar previous cases stored in the local health information system. The extensive testing of the system during the first wave of COVID-19 showed that this approach helps not only to draw a conclusion about the optimal treatment tactics and to train medical staff in real-time but also to optimize patients’ individual testing plans.ConclusionsThis project points to the possibility of rapid prototyping and effective usage of ”patient-like-mine” search systems at the time of a pandemic caused by a poorly known pathogen.","Bakin, Evgeny A.; Stanevich, Oksana V.; Danilenko, Daria M.; Lioznov, Dmitry A.; Kulikov, Alexander N.",Health Information Science and Systems,,636

Although most mutations have a minimum consequence, a small number of non-synonymous mutations may alter the virulence and antigenicity of the mutants. To evaluate the effects of viral mutations on drug safety and efficacy, we reviewed the biochemical features of the three main proteins and their potentials as drug targets, and analyzed the mutation profiles and their impacts on RNA therapeutics. We believe that monitoring and predicting mutation-introduced protein conformational changes in the three key viral proteins and evaluating their binding affinities and enzymatic activities with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated drugs by using computational modeling and machine learning processes can provide valuable information for the consideration of drug efficacy and drug safety for drug developers and drug reviewers. Finally, we propose an interactive database for drug developers and reviewers to use in evaluating the safety and efficacy of U.S. FDA regulated drugs with regard to viral mutations.","Zeng, Li; Li, Dongying; Tong, Weida; Shi, Tieliu; Ning, Baitang",Biochem Pharmacol,,636

205434,Gender Differences in the Mitigating Effect of Co-Parenting on Parental Burnout: The Gender Dimension Applied to COVID-19 Restrictions and Parental Burnout Levels,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Pandemic scenarios like the current Corona outbreak show the vulnerability of both globalized markets and just-in-time production processes for urgent medical equipment. Even usually cheap personal protection equipment becomes excessively expensive or is not deliverable at all. To avoid dangerous situations especially to medical professionals, but also to affected patients, 3D-printer and maker-communities have teamed up to develop and print shields, masks and adapters to help the medical personnel. In this study, we investigate three home-made respiratory masks for filter and protection efficacy and discuss the results and legal aspects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A home-printed respiratory mask with a commercial filter, a scuba-diving mask with a commercial filter and a mask sewn from a vacuum cleaner bag were investigated with 99mTc-labeled NaCl-aerosol, and the respective filter-efficacy was measured under a scintigraphic camera. RESULTS: The sewn mask from a vacuum cleaner bag had a filter efficacy of 69.76%, the 3D-printed mask of 39.27% and the scuba-diving mask of 85.07%. CONCLUSION: Home-printed personal protection equipment can be a-yet less efficient-alternative against aerosol in case professional masks are not available, but legal aspects of their use and distribution have to be kept in mind in order to avoid compensation claims.","Gierthmuehlen, Mortimer; Kuhlenkoetter, Bernd; Parpaley, Yaroslav; Gierthmuehlen, Stephan; Köhler, Dieter; Dellweg, Dominic",PLoS One,,636

205460,The Radiology Virtual Reading Room: During and Beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"During the course of an epidemic, one of the most challenging tasks for authorities is to decide what kind of restrictive measures to introduce and when these should be enforced. In order to take informed decisions in a fully rational manner, the onset of a critical regime, characterized by an exponential growth of the contagion, must be identified as quickly as possible. Providing rigorous quantitative tools to detect such an onset represents an important contribution from the scientific community to proactively support the political decision makers. In this paper, leveraging the quickest detection theory, we propose a mathematical model of the COVID-19 pandemic evolution and develop decision tools to rapidly detect the passage from a controlled regime to a critical one. A new sequential test-referred to as MAST (mean-agnostic sequential test)-is presented, and demonstrated on publicly available COVID-19 infection data from different countries. Then, the performance of MAST is investigated for the second pandemic wave, showing an effective trade-off between average decision delay [Formula: see text] and risk [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] is inversely proportional to the time required to declare the need to take unnecessary restrictive measures. To quantify risk, in this paper we adopt as its proxy the average occurrence rate of false alarms, in that a false alarm risks unnecessary social and economic disruption. Ideally, the decision mechanism should react as quick as possible for a given level of risk. We find that all the countries share the same behaviour in terms of quickest detection, specifically the risk scales exponentially with the delay, [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] depends on the specific nation. For a reasonably small risk level, say, one possibility in ten thousand (i.e., unmotivated implementation of countermeasures every 27 years, on the average), the proposed algorithm detects the onset of the critical regime with delay between a few days to 3 weeks, much earlier than when the exponential growth becomes evident. Strictly from the quickest-detection perspective adopted in this paper, it turns out that countermeasures against the second epidemic wave have not always been taken in a timely manner. The developed tool can be used to support decisions at different geographic scales (regions, cities, local areas, etc.), levels of risk, instantiations of controlled/critical regime, and is general enough to be applied to different pandemic time-series. Additional analysis and applications of MAST are made available on a dedicated website.","Braca, Paolo; Gaglione, Domenico; Marano, Stefano; Millefiori, Leonardo M; Willett, Peter; Pattipati, Krishna",Sci Rep,,636

205920,Building Resilience for Generations: The Tip of the Chromosome,2021,"BACKGROUND: Peptoniphilus indolicus is not usually seen in the eye or paranasal sinuses but is a commensal of the human vagina and gut. However, with COVID-19, eye infections and other unusual complications are possible with such unsuspected bacteria. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 76-year-old white male from a nursing home tested positive for COVID-19 and was sent from a nursing facility for left eye drainage and psychiatric evaluation. Upon presentation, the patient was not fully oriented and could not provide a history of the eye drainage. CT scan showed sinusitis with left orbital and periorbital abscess formation, cellulitis, and extensive osteomyelitis. He underwent endoscopic transnasal drainage and orbiotomy. Cultures returned positive for methicillin-resistant Stapholococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus constellatus, and Peptoniphilus indolicus. He was maintained on several days of IV antibiotics and returned to the nursing home. He then presented 2 months later and required enucleation of his globe, due to the presence of multiple scleral perforations in the setting of orbital abscess, as well as removal of necrotic orbital bone. CONCLUSIONS: Given the concomitant infection with COVID-19 and unusual presentation, the patient's sinus cultures support the notion that COVID-19 can affect the presence of bacteria within certain anatomical regions. Specifically, Peptoniphilus indolicus is not normally found outside of the vagina or gut biome. Avascular, pale mucosa and bone of the nasal cavity was noted during surgery of this COVID-19 infected patient, which is in contrast to the friable and edematous tissue typically found in acutely infected sinuses. Our patient's orbital abscess began to drain spontaneously through the skin, which is rare for orbital abscesses. Also uncommon with orbital abscesses is the need for enucleation, which in this case was deemed necessary given that the abscess had perforated the sclera in multiple locations.","Shires, Courtney Brooke; Klug, Theodore; Dryden, Stephen; Ford, Joshua",Int J Surg Case Rep,,636

METHODS: Data on all procedures performed during the state-wide ban on elective procedures (March 19th, 2020 to May 18th, 2020) that required anesthesia involvement were collected retrospectively and compared to the same time period in 2019. RESULTS: A total of 5785 procedures were performed: 4005 (69%) in 2019, and 1780 (31%) in 2020, representing a 55% decrease in total cases. The percentage decrease was disproportionate across surgical services. Add-on cases increased from 23% to 39%, and outpatient procedures decreased from 60% to 27%. DISCUSSION: The ban on elective procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in the volume of procedures performed at a tertiary pediatric hospital that differed among surgical services.","Utria, Alan F; Javid, Patrick J; Chen, Jingyang; Rice-Townsend, Samuel E",Am. j. surg,,636

208689,Smart Beta Allocation and Macroeconomic Variables: The Impact of COVID-19,2021,"In managing the COVID-19 pandemic, several compelling narratives seem to have played a significant role in the decision-making processes regarding which risk mitigation and management measures to implement. Many countries were to a large extent unprepared for such a situation, even though predictions about a significant probability for a pandemic to occur existed, and national governments of several countries often acted in an uncoordinated manner, which resulted in many inconsistencies in the disaster risk reduction processes. Limited evidence has also made room for strategic narratives meant to persuade the public of the chosen set of actions, even though the degree of uncertainty regarding the outcomes of these was high, further complicating the situation. In this article, we assume a normative standpoint regarding rhapsodic decision making and suggest an integrated framework for a more elaborated decision analysis under the ambiguity of how to contain the virus spread from a policy point of view, while considering epidemiologic estimations and socioeconomic factors in a multi-stakeholder-multi-criteria context based on a co-creative work process for eliciting attitudes, perceptions, as well as preferences amongst relevant stakeholder groups. The framework, applied in our paper on Romania for demonstrative purposes, is used for evaluating mitigation measures for catastrophic events such as the COVID-19 situation, to mobilize better response strategies for future scenarios related to pandemics and other hazardous events, as well as to structure the production and analysis of narratives on the current pandemic effects.","Ekenberg, Love; Mihai, Adriana; Fasth, Tobias; Komendantova, Nadejda; Danielson, Mats",Front Public Health,,636
208902,Solid organ transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States,2021,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells by binding to the host cell receptor ACE2 and undergoing virus-host membrane fusion. Fusion is triggered by the protease TMPRSS2, which processes the viral Spike (S) protein to reveal the fusion peptide. SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a multibasic site at the S1-S2 boundary, which is thought to be cleaved by furin in order to prime S protein for TMPRSS2 processing. Here we show that CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of furin reduces, but does not prevent, the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. Comparing S processing in furin knockout cells to multibasic site mutants reveals that while loss of furin substantially reduces S1-S2 cleavage it does not prevent it. SARS-CoV-2 S protein also mediates cell-cell fusion, potentially allowing virus to spread virion-independently. We show that loss of furin in either donor or acceptor cells reduces, but does not prevent, TMPRSS2-dependent cell-cell fusion, unlike mutation of the multibasic site that completely prevents syncytia formation. Our results show that while furin promotes both SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and cell-cell spread it is not essential, suggesting furin inhibitors may reduce but not abolish viral spread.","Papa, Guido; Mallery, Donna L; Albecka, Anna; Welch, Lawrence G; Cattin-Ortolá, Jérôme; Luptak, Jakub; Paul, David; McMahon, Harvey T; Goodfellow, Ian G; Carter, Andrew; Munro, Sean; James, Leo C",PLoS Pathog,,636

The pandemic highlights the significance of the immediate local community or neighborhood, be it for providing assistance to individuals in need, the sensible sharing of public spaces or a renewed conscience for supporting local businesses. We argue that online neighborhood social networks (ONSNs) represent a viable solution for improving social resilience as they enhance a community's resistance to disruptions, quicken recovery to a normal level of functioning and can become a platform for creative solutions to strengthening social resilience. We conduct a multiple case study to demonstrate how ONSNs foster social resilience in the focal crisis and beyond.

209475,Optimal use of limited colonoscopy capacity in a fit-based crc screening program duringCOVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Over the past 20 years, research on the training-load-injury relationship has grown exponentially. With the benefit of more data, our understanding of the training-performance puzzle has improved. What were we thinking 20 years ago, and how has our thinking changed over time? Although early investigators attributed overuse injuries to excessive training loads, it has become clear that rapid spikes in training load, above what an athlete is accustomed, explain (at least in part) a large proportion of injuries. In this respect, it appears that overuse injuries may arise from athletes being underprepared for the load they are about to perform. However, a question of interest to both athletic trainers (ATs) and researchers is why some athletes sustain injury at low training loads, while others can tolerate much greater training loads? A higher chronic training load and well-developed aerobic fitness and lower body strength appear to moderate the training-injury relationship and provide a protective effect against spikes in load. The training-performance puzzle is complex and dynamic-at any given time, multiple inputs to injury and performance exist. The challenge facing researchers is obtaining large enough longitudinal data sets to capture the time-varying nature of physiological and musculoskeletal capacities and training-load data to adequately inform injury-prevention efforts. The training-performance puzzle can be solved, but it will take collaboration between researchers and clinicians as well as an understanding that efficacy (ie, how training load affects performance and injury in an idealized or controlled setting) does not equate to effectiveness (ie, how training load affects performance and injury in the real-world setting, where many variables cannot be controlled).","Gabbett, Tim J",J Athl Train,,636

The adoption of preventive practices by the public remains the mainstay in reducing the spread of COVID-19 but there is a dearth of validated tools to assess such infection prevention practices related to pandemics. This study was conducted to develop and validate a questionnaire for the assessment of preventive practices against COVID-19 in the general population. It was done following a standardized protocol involving questionnaire development through literature review, focused group discussions, in-depth interviews, expert opinion, and pre-testing. This was followed by the validation of the questionnaire through a cross-sectional survey on 108 individuals from diverse backgrounds in New Delhi, India in July 2020. Exploratory factor analysis was used to evaluate construct validity. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The developed questionnaire for assessing preventive practices consists of two sections: the first section of 18 items to evaluate preventive practices and the second section of 19 items for assessing various reasons for deficiencies in the preventive practices. The first section has good content validity (CVR=0.81 and S-CVI/Av =0.97) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient 0.82). Thus, this questionnaire is a valid and reliable tool for the comprehensive assessment of preventive practices and barriers related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Thus, we longitudinally investigated the dynamic changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and parallel changes in cytokine levels in COVID-19 patients with different disease severities to further address disease pathogenesis. METHODS: A total of 67 patients (10 moderate, 38 severe and 19 critical cases) with COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Wuhan from February 8th to April 6th, 2020 were retrospectively studied. Dynamic data of lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines were collected. RESULTS: On admission, compared with moderate cases, severe and critical cases showed significantly decreased levels of total lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells. IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly higher in the critical group. During the following hospitalization period, most of the lymphocyte subsets in the critical group began to recover to levels comparable to those in the severe group from the fourth week after illness onset, except for NK cells, which recovered after the sixth week. A sustained decrease in the lymphocyte subsets and an increase in IL-6 and IL-10 were observed in the nonsurvivors until death. There was a strong negative correlation between IL-6 and IL-10 and total lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells. CONCLUSIONS: A sustained decrease in lymphocyte subsets, especially CD4+ T cells and NK cells, interacting with proinflammatory cytokine storms was associated with severe disease and poor prognosis in COVID-19.","Liu, Yangli; Tan, Weiping; Chen, Haihong; Zhu, Ying; Wan, Li; Jiang, Ke; Guo, Yubiao; Tang, Kejing; Xie, Canmao; Yi, Hui; Kuang, Yukun; Luo, Yifeng",BMC Infect Dis,,636

As of April 16, 2020, the confirmed case count of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had surpassed 2 million. Based on full-genome sequence analysis, SARS-CoV-2 shows high homology to SARS-related coronaviruses identified in horseshoe bats1,2. Here we show the establishment and characterization of expandable intestinal organoids derived from horseshoe bats of the Rhinolophus sinicus species that can recapitulate bat intestinal epithelium. These bat enteroids are fully susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and sustain robust viral replication. Development of gastrointestinal symptoms in some patients with COVID-19 and detection of viral RNA in fecal specimens suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might cause enteric, in addition to respiratory, infection3,4. Here we demonstrate active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human intestinal organoids and isolation of infectious virus from the stool specimen of a patient with diarrheal COVID-19. Collectively, we established the first expandable organoid culture system of bat intestinal epithelium and present evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can infect bat intestinal cells. The robust SARS-CoV-2 replication in human intestinal organoids suggests that the human intestinal tract might be a transmission route of SARS-CoV-2.","Zhou, Jie; Li, Cun; Liu, Xiaojuan; Chiu, Man Chun; Zhao, Xiaoyu; Wang, Dong; Wei, Yuxuan; Lee, Andrew; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Chu, Hin; Cai, Jian-Piao; Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; Chan, Ivy Hau-Yee; Wong, Kenneth Kak-Yuen; Tsang, Owen Tak-Yin; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Chen, Honglin; Yuen, Kwok Yung",Nat Med,,636

We present our data on the use of rapid antigen test (RAT) as a screening tool prior to endoscopy to prevent the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent any GI endoscopic procedure from July 2020 to October 2020 at a tertiary referral center in New Delhi, India. All patients underwent screening for COVID-19 using RAT, and endoscopy was performed only when the RAT was negative. The data are presented as numbers and percentages. Results: A total of 3,002 endoscopic procedures were performed during the study period. Only one endoscopic procedure was performed in a COVID-19 positive patient. A total of 53 healthcare workers were involved in conducting these procedures. Only 2 healthcare workers (3.8%) were diagnosed COVID-19 positive, presumably due to community-acquired infection, during this period. Conclusions: The COVID-19 RAT is easily usable as a simple screening tool prior to GI endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dalal, Ashok; Sonika, Ujjwal; Kumar, Manish; George, Roshan; Kumar, Ajay; Srivastava, Siddharth; Sachdeva, Sanjeev; Sharma, Barjesh Chander",,,636

The objectives of this scoping review were to synthesise, evaluate and make recommendations based on the available literature regarding PGData use in HIV care. DESIGN: Scoping review. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Medline, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO and Emcare databases. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies involving PGData use within HIV care for people living with HIV and/or healthcare professionals (HCPs) published before February 2021. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted using a table and the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess empirical rigour. We used thematic analysis to evaluate content. RESULTS: 11 articles met the eligibility criteria. Studies were observational, predominantly concerned hypothetical or novel digital platforms, mainly conducted in high-income settings, and had small sample sizes (range=10-160). There were multiple definitions of PGData. In the majority of studies (n=9), participants were people living with HIV, with a few studies including HCPs, informatics specialists or mixed participant groups. Participants living with HIV were aged 23-78 years, mostly men, of diverse ethnicities, and had low educational, health literacy and income levels.We identified four key themes: (1) Perceptions of PGData and associated digital platforms; (2) Opportunities; (3) Anticipated barriers and (4) Potential impact on patient-HCP relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Use of PGData within HIV care warrants further study, especially with regard to digital inequalities, data privacy and security. There is a need for longitudinal data on use within HIV in a variety of settings with a broad range of users, including impact on clinical outcomes. This will allow greater understanding of the role of PGData use in improving the health and well-being of people living with HIV, which is increasingly pertinent as digital healthcare becomes more widespread as a result of COVID-19.","Hewitt, Clara; Lloyd, Karen C; Tariq, Shema; Durrant, Abigail; Claisse, Caroline; Kasadha, Bakita; Gibbs, Jo",BMJ Open,,636
213514,Legitimizing the development and use of Cameroon's national languages: lessons from COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is common and associated with worse outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome, RV dysfunction develops due to pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction, inflammation, and alveolar overdistension or atelectasis. Although similar pathogenic mechanisms may induce RV dysfunction in COVID-19, other COVID-19-specific pathology, such as pulmonary endothelialitis, thrombosis, or myocarditis, may also affect RV function. We quantified RV dysfunction by echocardiographic strain analysis and investigated its correlation with disease severity, ventilatory parameters, biomarkers, and imaging findings in critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We determined RV free wall longitudinal strain (FWLS) in 32 patients receiving mechanical ventilation for COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. Demographics, comorbid conditions, ventilatory parameters, medications, and laboratory findings were extracted from the medical record. Chest imaging was assessed to determine the severity of lung disease and the presence of pulmonary embolism. RESULTS: Abnormal FWLS was present in 66% of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients and was associated with higher lung compliance (39.6 vs 29.4 mL/cmH2O, P = 0.016), lower airway plateau pressures (21 vs 24 cmH2O, P = 0.043), lower tidal volume ventilation (5.74 vs 6.17 cc/kg, P = 0.031), and reduced left ventricular function. FWLS correlated negatively with age (r = -0.414, P = 0.018) and with serum troponin (r = 0.402, P = 0.034). Patients with abnormal RV strain did not exhibit decreased oxygenation or increased disease severity based on inflammatory markers, vasopressor requirements, or chest imaging findings. CONCLUSIONS: RV dysfunction is common among critically ill COVID-19 patients and is not related to abnormal lung mechanics or ventilatory pressures. Instead, patients with abnormal FWLS had more favorable lung compliance. RV dysfunction may be secondary to diffuse intravascular micro- and macro-thrombosis or direct myocardial damage.

213795,"Comparing the laws of England, Wales and Italy Relating to the Unilateral Modification for the Terms of Operational Contract during the COVID-19 Pandemic",2021,"During a severe pandemic, especially one causing respiratory illness, many people may require mechanical ventilation. Depending on the extent of the outbreak, there may be insufficient capacity to provide ventilator support to all of those in need. As part of a larger conceptual framework for determining need for and allocation of ventilators during a public health emergency, this article focuses on the strategies to assist state and local planners to allocate stockpiled ventilators to healthcare facilities during a pandemic, accounting for critical factors in facilities' ability to make use of additional ventilators. These strategies include actions both in the pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic stages. As a part of pandemic preparedness, public health officials should identify and query healthcare facilities in their jurisdiction that currently care for critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation to determine existing inventory of these devices and facilities' ability to absorb additional ventilators. Facilities must have sufficient staff, space, equipment, and supplies to utilize allocated ventilators adequately. At the time of an event, jurisdictions will need to verify and update information on facilities' capacity prior to making allocation decisions. Allocation of scarce life-saving resources during a pandemic should consider ethical principles to inform state and local plans for allocation of ventilators. In addition to ethical principles, decisions should be informed by assessment of need, determination of facilities' ability to use additional ventilators, and facilities' capacity to ensure access to ventilators for vulnerable populations (eg, rural, inner city, and uninsured and underinsured individuals) or high-risk populations that may be more susceptible to illness.","Koonin, Lisa M; Pillai, Satish; Kahn, Emily B; Moulia, Danielle; Patel, Anita",Health Secur,,636

215157,PIN42 Molecular Testing Dynamics Is Reactive to COVID-19 Incidence: Observations from the Colombian Experience,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has spread worldwide via international travel. This study traced its diffusion from the global to national level and identified a few superspreaders that played a central role in the transmission of this disease in India. DATA AND METHODS: We used the travel history of infected patients from January 30 to April 6, 2020, as the primary data source. A total of 1386 cases were assessed, of which 373 were international, and 1013 were national contacts. The networks were generated in Gephi software (version 0.9.2). RESULTS: The maximum numbers of connections were established from Dubai (degree 144) and the UK (degree 64). Dubai's eigenvector centrality was the highest that made it the most influential node. The statistical metrics calculated from the data revealed that Dubai and the UK played a crucial role in spreading the disease in Indian states and were the primary sources of COVID-19 importations into India. Based on the modularity class, different clusters were shown to form across Indian states, which demonstrated the formation of a multi-layered social network structure. A significant increase in confirmed cases was reported in states like Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Andhra Pradesh during the first phase of the nationwide lockdown, which spanned from March 25 to April 14, 2020. This was primarily attributed to a gathering at the Delhi Religious Conference (DRC) known as Tabliqui Jamaat. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 got induced into Indian states mainly due to International travels with the very first patient travelling from Wuhan, China. Subsequently, the contacts of positive cases were located, and a significant spread was identified in states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Kerala, and Karnataka. The COVID-19's spread in phase one was traced using the travelling history of the patients, and it was found that most of the transmissions were local.","Azad, Sarita; Devi, Sushma",J. travel med,,636

A positive correlation has been observed between the spread of the virus and air pollution, one of the greatest challenges of our millennium. Covid-19 could have an air transmission and atmospheric particulate matter (PM) could create a suitable environment for transporting the virus at greater distances than those considered for close contact. Moreover, PM induces inflammation in lung cells and exposure to PM could increase the susceptibility and severity of the Covid-19 patient symptoms. The new coronavirus has been shown to trigger an inflammatory storm that would be sustained in the case of pre-exposure to polluting agents. In this review, we highlight the potential role of PM in the spread of Covid-19, focusing on Italian cities whose PM daily concentrations were found to be higher than the annual average allowed during the months preceding the epidemic. Furthermore, we analyze the positive correlation between the virus spread, PM, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor involved in the entry of the virus into pulmonary cells and inflammation.","Comunian, Silvia; Dongo, Dario; Milani, Chiara; Palestini, Paola",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,636

217548,Time-sensitive ambulatory orthopaedic soft-tissue surgery paradigms during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The countries around the world are dealing with air quality issues for decades due to their mode of production and energy usages. The outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic and consequent global economic shutdown, for the first time, provided a base for the real-time experiment of the effect of reduced emissions across the globe in abetting the air pollution issue. The present study dealt with the changes in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), a marker of air pollution, because of global economic shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. The study considered the countries in south and south-east Asia (SSEA), Europe and the USA for their extended period of lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic. Daily Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and tropospheric column density of NO2 and SO2 from Ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) sensors, including meteorological data such as wind speed (WS) and relative humidity (RH) were analyzed during the pre-lockdown (2017-2019) and lockdown periods (2020). The average AOD, NO2 and SO2 during the lockdown period were statistically compared with their pre-lockdown average using Wilcoxon-signed-paired-rank test. The accuracy of the MODIS-derived AOD, including the changing pattern of AOD due to lockdown was estimated using AERONET data. The weekly anomaly of AOD, NO2 and SO2 was used for analyzing the space-time variation of aerosol load as restrictions were imposed by the concerned countries at the different points of time. Additionally, a random forest-based regression (RF) model was used to examine the effects of meteorological and emission parameters on the spatial variation of AOD. A significant reduction of AOD (-20%) was obtained for majority of the areas in SSEA, Europe and USA during the lockdown period. Yet, the clusters of increased AOD (30-60%) was obtained in the south-east part of SSEA, the western part of Europe and US regions. NO2 reductions were measured up to 20-40%, while SO2 emission increased up to 30% for a majority of areas in these regions. A notable space-time variation was observed in weekly anomaly. We found the evidence of the formation of new particles for causing high AOD under high RH and low WS, aided by the downward vertical wind flow. The RF model showed a distinguishable relative importance of emission and meteorological factors among these regions to account for the spatial variability of AOD. Our findings suggest that the continued lockdown might provide a temporary solution to air pollution; however, to combat persistent air quality issues, it needs switching over to the cleaner mode of production and energy. The findings of this study, thus, advocated for alternative energy policy at the global scale.","Acharya, Prasenjit; Barik, Gunadhar; Gayen, Bijoy Krishna; Bar, Somnath; Maiti, Arabinda; Sarkar, Ashis; Ghosh, Surajit; De, Sikhendra Kisor; Sreekesh, S",Environ Res,,636

Between 25 March-8 June 2020, COVID-19 restrictions severely reduced access to dentistry in England. Dental practices were instructed to manage patients remotely with advice, analgesics and antibiotics, where appropriate.Aim To describe the impact of the policy to restrict dental access on antibiotic prescribing.Methods NHS Business Services Authority 2018-2020 data for England were analysed to describe national and regional trends in dental antibiotic use.Results Antibiotic prescribing in April to July 2020 was 25% higher than April to July 2019, with a peak in June 2020. Some regions experienced greater increases and for longer periods than others. The increase was highest in London (60%) and lowest in the South West (10%). East of England had the highest rate of dental antibiotic prescriptions per 1,000 of the population every month over the study period (April to July 2020).Conclusion Restricted access to dental care due to COVID-19 resulted in greatly increased dental antibiotic prescribing, against an otherwise downward trend. As dental care adapts to the COVID-19 era, it is important to ensure access for all to high-quality urgent dental care. Understanding the reasons for variation will help to optimise the use of antibiotics in the future.","Shah, Sagar; Wordley, Valerie; Thompson, Wendy",Br Dent J,,636

Identifying resources that help mitigate stress is critical to maintaining HCPs' well-being. However, to our knowledge, no instrument has systematically examined how different levels of resources help HCPs cope with stress during COVID-19. This cross-sectional study involved 119 HCPs (64 nurses and 55 physicians) and evaluated the perceived availability, utilization, and helpfulness of a list of personal, hospital, and healthcare system resources. Participants also reported on their level of burnout, psychological distress, and intentions to quit. Results revealed that HCPs perceived the most useful personal resource to be family support; the most useful hospital resources were a safe environment, personal protective equipment, and support from colleagues; the most useful system resources were job protection, and clear communication and information about COVID. Moreover, HCPs who perceived having more available hospital resources also reported lower levels of psychological distress symptoms, burnout, and intentions to quit. Finally, although training and counseling services were perceived as useful to reduce stress, training was not perceived as widely available, and counseling services, though reported as being available, were underutilized. This instrument helps identify resources that support HCPs, providing implications for healthcare management.","Lou, Nigel Mantou; Montreuil, Tina; Feldman, Liane S; Fried, Gerald M; Lavoie-Tremblay, Mélanie; Bhanji, Farhan; Kennedy, Heather; Kaneva, Pepa; Drouin, Susan; Harley, Jason M",Eval Health Prof,,636

Estudo transversal realizado com idosos brasileiros que participaram de um inquérito de saúde (N = 9.173), com método de amostragem ""bola de neve virtual"". Os dados foram coletados via web, por meio de questionário autopreenchido. Foram estimadas prevalências, intervalos de confiança e, para verificar a independência das estimativas, utilizou-se o teste qui-quadrado de Pearson. Durante a pandemia, houve diminuição da renda em quase metade dos domicílios dos idosos. O distanciamento social total foi adotado por 30,9% (IC95%: 27,8; 34,1) e 12,2% (IC95%: 10,1; 14,7) não aderiram. Idosos que não trabalhavam antes da pandemia aderiram em maior número às medidas de distanciamento social total. Grande parte apresentou comorbidades associadas ao maior risco de desenvolvimento da forma grave de COVID-19. Sentimentos de solidão, ansiedade e tristeza foram frequentes entre os idosos, especialmente entre as mulheres. A pandemia da COVID-19 aprofundou a desigualdade ao afetar os idosos mais vulneráveis. Estratégias para mitigar a solidão e o distanciamento social devem ser feitas levando-se em conta a vulnerabilidade social e a acentuada diferença entre homens e mulheres quanto à composição domiciliar e às condições socioeconômicas e de trabalho. Recomenda-se o desenvolvimento de pesquisas representativas da população idosa brasileira e que investiguem o impacto da pandemia neste grupo.","Romero, Dalia Elena; Muzy, Jéssica; Damacena, Giseli Nogueira; Souza, Nathalia Andrade de; Almeida, Wanessa da Silva de; Szwarcwald, Celia Landmann; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Barros, Marilisa Berti de Azevedo; Souza Júnior, Paulo Roberto Borges de; Azevedo, Luiz Otávio; Gracie, Renata; Pina, Maria de Fátima de; Lima, Margareth Guimarães; Machado, Ísis Eloah; Gomes, Crizian Saar; Werneck, André Oliveira; Silva, Danilo Rodrigues Pereira da",Cad.

Currently, there is no effective treatment for the infection. Areas covered: We have recently described the NZACE2-Patari project, which seeks to administer modified Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) molecules early in the infection to intercept and block SARS-CoV-2 binding to the pulmonary epithelium. Expert opinion: Since the nasopharyngeal mucosa is infected in the first asymptomatic phase of the infection, treatment of the nose is likely to be safe and potentially effective. The intercepted virus will be swallowed and destroyed in the stomach. There is however a limited window of opportunity to alter the trajectory of the infection in an individual patient, which requires access to rapid testing for SARS-CoV-2. The proposed strategy is analogous to passive immunization of viral infections such as measles and may be of particular benefit to immunodeficient and unvaccinated individuals.","Ameratunga, Rohan; Woon, See-Tarn; Steele, Richard; Snell, Russell; Medlicott, Natalie; Mears, Emily; Leung, Euphemia; Lehnert, Klaus; Jordan, Anthony; Das, Shyamal; Abbott, William; Longhurst, Hilary; Quiñones-Mateu, Miguel E",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,,636

OBJECTIVE: Describe the experience and perceptions of students of the Nursing university degree during their participation as health support in the COVID-19 health crisis in Spain. DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional survey study. METHOD: 503 students enrolled in the 4th course of the Nursing degree in Spain during the months of March and April 2020. An online questionnaire was developed, based on a pilot study and distributed through the Nursing Association, students' unions and students' associations. Variables were used to describe their participation, degree of preparedness and training needs to determine how to improve training through descriptive statistics, as well as nonparametric tests to analyse the relationship between training and degree of preparedness nursing students. Results are reported according to the STROBE Statement. RESULTS: 73.2% (368) of students offered to participate in healthcare aid, of which 225 were actively involved. 27.8% carried out nursing tasks without supervision, and 47.7% assisted COVID-19 patients as any other nurse. Only 3.4% felt very prepared to work in the field of intensive care, finding that those students who perceived a higher degree of preparedness had received previous training in personal protective equipment and mechanical ventilation (p < 0.005). The highest scores for training activities that may improve their preparedness were simulations to improve levels of anxiety and stress when managing critical patients, simulation in ventilatory support and mandatory practices in services where ventilators are used. CONCLUSIONS: Although three out of four students were willing to provide health assistance, they recognise that they were not specially prepared in the field of intensive care and demand training with simulation to improve anxiety and stress levels in the management of critical patients and simulation in ventilatory support. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Students have been vital resources for our health system and society when they have been needed. It is now up to us, both teachers and health authorities, to share their efforts by implementing the necessary improvements in training and safety measures not only because these affects the health and safety of the patient, but because they will be essential parts in future pandemics.","Hernández-Martínez, Antonio; Rodríguez-Almagro, Julián; Martínez-Arce, Alejandro; Romero-Blanco, Cristina; García-Iglesias, Juan Jesús; Gómez-Salgado, Juan",J. clin. nurs,,636
220839,Practical tips for managing change during the Covid-19 pandemic,2020,"Governments around the world must rapidly mobilize and make difficult policy decisions to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly, how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider the age composition of local and national contexts as well as intergenerational interactions. We also call for countries to provide case and fatality data disaggregated by age and sex to improve real-time targeted forecasting of hospitalization and critical care needs.","Dowd, Jennifer Beam; Andriano, Liliana; Brazel, David M; Rotondi, Valentina; Block, Per; Ding, Xuejie; Liu, Yan; Mills, Melinda C",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,636

The bidirectional relationship between the inhabitants of our gut, the gut microbiota, and COVID-19 pathogenesis, as well as the underlying mechanism involved, must be elucidated in order to increase FMT safety and efficacy. In this perspective, we discuss the crucial cross-talk between the gut microbiota and the lungs, known as the gut-lung axis, during COVID-19 infection, as well as the putative effect of these microorganisms and their functional activity (i.e., short chain fatty acids and bile acids) on FMT treatment. In addition, we highlight the urgent need to investigate the possible impact of COVID-19 on FMT safety and efficacy, as well as instilling stringent screening protocols of donors and recipients during COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 pandemic to produce a cohesive and optimized FMT treatment plan across all centers and in all countries across the globe.","Kazemian, Negin; Kao, Dina; Pakpour, Sepideh",Int. j. mol. sci.

Matching criteria for controls were age, sex, body mass index, race, ethnicity, comorbidities, week of admission, oxygen requirement, D-dimer, lymphocyte counts, corticosteroid use, and anticoagulation use. There was no difference in mortality or oxygenation between CCP recipients and controls at day 28. When stratified by age, compared with matched controls, CCP recipients less than 65 years had 4-fold lower risk of mortality and 4-fold lower risk of deterioration in oxygenation or mortality at day 28. For CCP recipients, pretransfusion spike protein IgG, IgM, and IgA titers were associated with mortality at day 28 in univariate analyses. No adverse effects of CCP were observed. Our results suggest CCP may be beneficial for hospitalized patients less than 65 years, but data from controlled trials are needed to validate this finding and establish the effect of aging on CCP efficacy.","Yoon, Hyun Ah; Bartash, Rachel; Gendlina, Inessa; Rivera, Johanna; Nakouzi, Antonio; Bortz, Robert H; Wirchnianski, Ariel S; Paroder, Monika; Fehn, Karen; Serrano-Rahman, Leana; Babb, Rachelle; Sarwar, Uzma N; Haslwanter, Denise; Laudermilch, Ethan; Florez, Catalina; Dieterle, M Eugenia; Jangra, Rohit K; Fels, J Maximilian; Tong, Karen; Mariano, Margarette C; Vergnolle, Olivia; Georgiev, George I; Herrera, Natalia G; Malonis, Ryan J; Quiroz, Jose A; Morano, Nicholas C; Krause, Gregory J; Sweeney, Joseph M; Cowman, Kelsie; Allen, Stephanie; Annam, Jayabhargav; Applebaum, Ariella; Barboto, Daniel; Khokhar, Ahmed; Lally, Brianna J; Lee, Audrey; Lee, Max; Malaviya, Avinash; Sample, Reise; Yang, Xiuyi A; Li, Yang; Ruiz, Rafael; Thota, Raja; Barnhill, Jason; Goldstein, Doctor Y; Uehlinger, Joan; Garforth, Scott J; Almo, Steven C; Lai, Jonathan R; Gil, Morayma Reyes",JCI insight,,636

Particularly, orthopedic departments had to adapt their operational models. Purpose: This review aimed to quantify the reduction in surgical and outpatient caseloads, identify other significant trends and ascertain the impact of these trends on orthopedic residency training programs. Methods: Medline and Embase were searched for articles describing case load for surgeries, outpatient clinic attendance, or emergency department (ED) visits. Statistical analysis of quantitative data was performed after a Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. Results were pooled with random effects by DerSimonian and Laird model. When insufficient data was available, a systematic approach was used to present the results instead. Results: A total of 23 studies were included in this study. The number of elective surgeries, trauma procedures and outpatient attendance decreased by 80% (2013/17400, 0.20, CI: 0.12 to 0.29), 47% (3887/17561, 0.53, CI: 0.37 to 0.69) and 63% (84174/123967, 0.37, CI: 0.24 to 0.51) respectively. During the pandemic, domestic injuries and polytrauma increased. Residency training was disrupted due to diminished clinical exposure and changing teaching methodologies. Additionally, residents had more duties which contributed to a lower quality of life. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has made an unprecedented impact on orthopedics departments worldwide. The slow return of orthopedic departments to normalcy and the compromised training of residents due to the pandemic points to an uncertain future for healthcare institutions worldwide, wherein the impact of this pandemic may yet still be felt far in the future.","Ow, Zachariah Gene Wing; Cheong, Chin Kai; Chin, Yip Han; Chin, Brian Zhaojie",,,636

(Special Issue: Safety & CoVid-19.),2021,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world issued stay-at-home orders, which required that individuals stay at home unless they were engaging in certain activities. Often these orders would designate certain goods and services as ""essential"" and would permit individuals engaged in the production, delivery, and purchase of those goods and services to leave their homes to do so. Implicit in these policies, of course, is the assumption that policymakers can know ex ante which goods and services are essential. As proved true while these stay-at-home orders were in effect, essentialness is necessarily subjective and depends on knowledge that is often dispersed, inarticulate, and changes over time. Policymakers, however, do not and often cannot have access to the local knowledge needed to determine ex ante which goods and services are essential, and they lack the feedback mechanisms they would need to adroitly adapt when circumstances change. This paper examines these knowledge problems associated with designating certain goods and services as ""essential"" when crafting and implementing stay-at-home orders.","Storr, Virgil Henry; Haeffele, Stefanie; Lofthouse, Jordan K; Grube, Laura E",Southern economic journal,,636

226864,Covid-19 and the kin contract: Navigating the family and the state during the pandemic,2020,"ABSTRACT Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, used face masks have increasingly littered the environment and are causes for concern since they are commonly made of plastics such as polypropylene. Understanding production of microplastics from face masks is essential for predicting the post COVID-19 pandemic impact on the soil ecosystem. We investigated the generation of nanofibers from meltblown face mask filters (MB filters) and their adverse effects on soil species, particularly the earthworm and springtail. Results of MB filter soil bioassays at a high concentration (1000mg/kg dry soil) suggest inhibited reproduction and stunted growth in springtails, decreased intracellular esterase activity in earthworm coelomocytes, and inhibited spermatogenesis in male earthworm reproductive tissues. Moreover, it was estimated that generation of nanofibers from microfibers and fragments of MB filters might occur in the soil ecosystem post COVID-19. This study does not oppose the use of face masks but aims to encourage appropriate disposal of the masks. Preservation of human health and the ecosystem should be prioritized even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.","Il Kwak, Jin An Youn-Joo",Journal of Hazardous Materials,,636

METHODS: 73 patients who died from COVID-19 were retrospectively included. The clinical and laboratory data of the patients were extracted from electronic medical records. The clinical data, inflammation-related laboratory results, and CT imaging features were summarized. The laboratory results and dynamic changes of imaging features and severity scores of lung involvement based on chest CT were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age was 67±12 years. The typical clinical symptoms included fever (88%), cough (62%) and dyspnea (23%). 65% patients had at least one underlying disease. GGO with consolidation was the most common feature for the five lung lobes (47%-53% among the various lobes), with total severity score of 12.97±5.87 for the both lungs. The proportion of GGO with consolidation is markedly increased on follow-up chest CT compared with initial CT scans, as well as the averaging total CT scores (14.53±5.76 vs. 6.60±5.65; P<0.001). The severity score was rated as severe (white lung) in 13% patients on initial CT scans, and in 60% on follow-up CT scans. Moderate positive correlations were found between CT scores and leucocytes, neutrophils and IL-2R (r = 0.447-0581, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Chest CT findings and laboratory test results were worsening in patients who died of COVID-19, with moderate positive correlations between CT severity scores and inflammation-related factors of leucocytes, neutrophils, and IL-2R. Chest CT imaging may play an more important role in monitoring disease progression and predicting prognosis.","Hu, Yiqi; Zhan, Chenao; Chen, Chengyang; Ai, Tao; Xia, Liming",PLoS One,,636

Social distancing and lockdown drove the educational system to uncharted territories at an accelerated pace, leaving educators little time to adjust. OBJECTIVES: To describe changes in teaching during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We described the steps implemented at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Faculty of Medicine during the initial 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic to preserve teaching and the academic ecosystem. RESULTS: Several established methodologies, such as the flipped classroom and active learning, demonstrated effectiveness. In addition, we used creative methods to teach clinical medicine during the ban on bedside teaching and modified community engagement activities to meet COVID-19 induced community needs. CONCLUSIONS: The challenges and the lessons learned from teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted us to adjust our teaching methods and curriculum using multiple online teaching methods and promoting self-learning. It also provided invaluable insights on our pedagogy and the teaching of medicine in the future with emphasis on students and faculty being part of the changes and adjustments in curriculum and teaching methods.

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). No qualitative assessment has yet described the physical and mental health conditions of frontline medical personnel in the COVID-19 outbreaks. Methods: Here, 251 frontline medical personnel involved in COVID-19 missions completed electronic questionnaires, consisting of 31 categorical variables related to their physical and mental health status, medical history and environmental conditions. We constructed a correlation amongst these variables through pairwise Kendall rank correlation coefficient test. Then, clusters of highly correlated variables were identified using the leading eigenvector. Finally, we used the network and clusters to clarify the correlations amongst variables. Results: This qualitative study identified the six clusters. Cluster 1 was characterized by skin allergy. Cluster 2 was predominantly associated with anxiety. Cluster 3 consisted mostly of respiratory symptoms. The participants in cluster 4 had medical history. Cluster 5 and cluster 6 were characterized by disinfection and demography, respectively. Finally, we revealed three major findings. First, more than 80% of medical personnel worry about COVID-19-related infection and experience newly appearing anxiety (56.2%), airway or heart symptoms (34.3%) and skin allergies (20.3%). Second, COVID-19-related worry significantly associates with all variables in the anxiety and respiratory symptom clusters. Third, new-onset skin allergies did not associate with either disinfection or anxiety, but did associate with a previous history of allergies. Conclusions: COVID-19-related worry leads to physical and mental health problems amongst medical personnel. Effective responses and interventions could relieve a series of new-onset physical and mental health problems.","Gao, Jing; Li, Jing; Han, Xia; Yuan, Yuan; Li, Chuan-Xing; Zhang, Dong-Quan",Int J Med Sci,,636

228923,Quantifying early COVID-19 outbreak transmission in South Africa and exploring vaccine efficacy scenarios,2020,"Objective: The digitalization of the healthcare system poses new challenges for physicians. Thus, the relevance of learning digital competencies (DiCo), such as dealing with data sets, apply telemedicine or using apps, is already growing in medical education. DiCo should be clearly separated from digitized teaching formats, which have been increasingly used since the COVID 19 pandemic. This article outlines the faculties in Germany where DiCo are already integrated into medical education. Methods: Courses with DiCo as teaching content were collected by a literature research on Pubmed and Google as well as by contacting all dean's offices and other persons responsible for teaching at German medical faculties. The courses were summarized in a table. Results: In a first survey, 16 universities were identified that offer courses on DiCo. In the elective area at the universities, 17 courses and in the compulsory area eight courses could be identified. The scope and content of the courses diverged between compulsory curricula, integrated courses of different lengths, and elective courses that are one-time or longitudinally integrated. The topics taught are heterogeneous and include fundamentals of medical informatics such as data management on the one hand and a collection of e.g. ethics, law, apps, artificial intelligence, telemedicine and robotics on the other hand. Conclusion: Currently, only some German medical faculties offer courses on DiCo. These courses vary in scope and design. They are frequently part of the elective curriculum and only reach some of the students. The possibility of embedding DiCo in the already existing cross-sectional area appears limited. In view of the ongoing digitalization of healthcare, it is necessary to make future courses on DiCo accessible to all medical students. In order to drive this expansion forward, the implementation of the new learning objectives catalogue, in which DiCo are integrated, a network formation, a teaching qualification as well as the involvement of students is recommended.","Aulenkamp, Jana; Mikuteit, Marie; Löffler, Tobais; Schmidt, Jeremy",GMS J Med Educ,,636

This paper aimed to examine the effect of n3-PUFA supplementation on inflammatory and biochemical markers in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized clinical trial study was conducted on 128 critically ill patients infected with COVID-19 who were randomly assigned to the intervention (fortified formula with n3-PUFA) (n = 42) and control (n = 86) groups. Data on 1 month survival rate, blood glucose, sodium (Na), potassium (K), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), albumin, hematocrit (HCT), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), mean arterial pressure (MAP), O2 saturation (O2sat), arterial pH, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), bicarbonate (HCO3), base excess (Be), white blood cells (WBCs), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), hemoglobin (Hb), platelet (Plt), and the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were collected at baseline and after 14 days of the intervention. RESULTS: The intervention group had significantly higher 1-month survival rate and higher levels of arterial pH, HCO3, and Be and lower levels of BUN, Cr, and K compared with the control group after intervention (all P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between blood glucose, Na, HCT, Ca, P, MAP, O2sat, PO2, PCO2, WBCs, GCS, Hb, Plt, PTT, and albumin between two groups. CONCLUSION: Omega-3 supplementation improved the levels of several parameters of respiratory and renal function in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Further clinical studies are warranted.

229576,Impact of COVID-19 on biochemical parameters: a narrative review,2020,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D has diverse and extensive effects on the immune system, including activating innate immunity and reducing the overactive adaptive immune response. A systematic review was performed to identify and synthesize the best available evidence on the association between vitamin D level and risk of COVID-19, adverse outcomes and possible benefits of supplementation in aged 60 years or over. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed© and Scopus© for all publications from inception published before 15 March 2021. Studies reporting data from aged patients on vitamin D use and COVID-19 were included. Basic science articles, editorials and correspondence were excluded. Publication year, study design and setting, characteristics of the study population were extracted. This study is registered with PROSPERO, under the number CRD42020223993. RESULTS: In total, 707 studies were identified, of which 11 observational studies were included in the final review. Four studies compared vitamin D-supplemented COVID-19 patients to non-supplemented patients, and seven compared patients with vitamin D deficiency to patients without deficiency. In all four studies, patients with vitamin D supplementation had better rates of primary clinical outcomes (death, the severity of the disease, oxygen therapy requirement ). In studies comparing patients with vitamin D deficiency and patients without vitamin D deficiency, those without vitamin D deficiency had better primary clinical outcomes (death rate, the severity of the disease, oxygen therapy requirement, invasive mechanical ventilation need ). CONCLUSION: This systematic review seems to support an association between vitamin D deficiency and the risk of COVID-19 in aged people. In addition, vitamin D deficiency appears to expose these subjects to a greater risk of adverse outcomes. Because of its simplicity of administration, and the rarity of side effects, including vitamin D in preventive strategies for certain viral diseases, it appears to be an attractive option.","Dramé, Moustapha; Cofais, Cécilia; Hentzien, Maxime; Proye, Emeline; Coulibaly, Pécory Souleymane; Demoustier-Tampère, David; Destailleur, Marc-Henri; Lotin, Maxime; Cantagrit, Eléonore; Cebille, Agnès; Desprez, Anne; Blondiau, Fanny; Kanagaratnam, Lukshe; Godaert, Lidvine",Nutrients,,636

The former is an extended black-hole entropy that arises due to quantum-gravitational effects which deform the black-hole surface by giving it an intricate, fractal form. We extract a simple differential equation for the evolution of the dark energy density parameter, which possesses standard holographic dark energy as a limiting sub-case, and we show that the scenario can describe the universe thermal history, with the sequence of matter and dark energy eras. Additionally, the new Barrow exponent $\Delta$ significantly affects the dark energy equation of state, and according to its value it can lead it to lie in the quintessence regime, in the phantom regime, or experience the phantom-divide crossing during the evolution. Finally, in the limiting case of maximal quantum-gravitational effects, Barrow holographic dark energy becomes constant and $\Lambda$CDM paradigm is restored, although through a completely different physical framework.","Saridakis, Emmanuel N.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04115v1.pdf,636

However, the activities and efficiencies of the transition metal-based nanoparticles or single-atom sites are still ambiguous in Fenton-like reactions. Herein, to compare the Fenton-like catalytic efficiencies of the nanoparticles and single atoms, the free-standing nanofibrous catalyst comprising Co nanocrystals and Co-Nx codoped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or bare Co-Nx doped CNTs is fabricated. It is noteworthy that all these nanofibrous catalysts exhibit efficient activities, mesoporous structures, and conductive carbon networks, which allow a feasible validation of the catalytic effects. Benefiting from the maximized atomic utilization, the atomic Co-Nx centers exhibit much higher reaction kinetic constant (&#954; = 0.157 min-1 ) and mass activity toward the degradation of bisphenol A, far exceeding the Co nanocrystals (&#954; = 0.082 min-1 ). However, for the volume activities, the single-atom catalyst does not show apparent advantages compared to the nanocrystal-based catalyst. Overall, this work not only provides a viable pathway for comparing Fenton-like catalytic effects of transition metal-based nanoparticles or single atoms but also opens up a new avenue for developing prominent catalysts for organic pollutants' degradation.","Gao, Yun; Yang, Chengdong; Zhou, Mi; He, Chao; Cao, Sujiao; Long, Yanping; Li, Shuang; Lin, Yi; Zhu, Puxin; Cheng, Chong",Small,,636

Methods: Human post-mortem eyes from 13 non-diabetic control cases and 11 diabetic retinopathy cases were analyzed for the expression of ACE2. To compare the vascular ACE2 expression between different organs that involve in diabetes, the expression of ACE2 was investigated in renal specimens from nondiabetic and diabetic nephropathy patients. Expression of TMPRSS2, a cell-surface protease that facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry, was also investigated in human nondiabetic retinas. Primary human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) and primary human retinal pericytes (HRPCs) were further used to confirm the vascular ACE2 expression in human retina. Results: We found that ACE2 was expressed in multiple nonvascular neuroretinal cells, including the retinal ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, and photoreceptor outer segments in both nondiabetic and diabetic retinopathy specimens. Strikingly, we observed significantly more ACE2 positive vessels in the diabetic retinopathy specimens. By contrast, in another end-stage organ affected by diabetes, the kidney, ACE2 in nondiabetic and diabetic nephropathy showed apical expression of ACE2 tubular epithelial cells, but no endothelial expression in glomerular or peritubular capillaries. Western blot analysis of protein lysates from HRECs and HRPCs confirmed expression of ACE2. TMPRSS2 expression was present in multiple retinal neuronal cells, vascular and perivascular cells, and Müller glia. Conclusions: Together, these results indicate that retina expresses ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Moreover, there are increased vascular ACE2 expression in diabetic retinopathy retinas.","Zhou, Lingli; Xu, Zhenhua; Guerra, James; Rosenberg, Avi Z; Fenaroli, Paride; Eberhart, Charles G; Duh, Elia J",Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,,636

METHODS: This 8-week webinar series ran from July 1 to August 28, 2020. An optional exit survey was distributed to participants. Data were analyzed to characterize and better understand trends among a global cohort of participants. RESULTS: A total of 16,484 people registered for BRAINterns, and 6675 took the survey (40.5% response rate). Responders represented 87 countries, of which the majority were from the United States and Canada (90.48%, n = 6039). Responders were primarily female (82.9%, n = 5521). Racial and ethnic representation was majority Asian (42%, n = 2798), followed by White (22.7%, n = 1514), Hispanic/Latino (16.2%, n = 1080), and Black and African American (7.7%, n = 516). Participants reported hearing about BRAINterns through various social media platforms (72.18%, n = 4818)-the most popular was TikTok (33.4%, n = 2232). Overall, 93.4% of participants reported that the course was a good use of their time during the pandemic, and 86.7% reported that the course helped replace lost opportunities. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that webinar-based education is an effective method of expanding access to careers in medicine and in particular, neurosurgery, to traditionally underrepresented populations. Social media can be a powerful tool to combat barriers to early exposure and vastly improve diversity within the field.","D039,; Amico, Randy S; Immidisetti, Amanda V; Katz, Joshua; White, Tim; Bedi, Anupama; Baum, Griffin; Ellis, Jason; Levine, Mitchell; Ortiz, Rafael; Boockvar, John A; Langer, David J",World Neurosurg,,636
231233,"The COVID-19 lockdown and psychological distress among Italian parents: Influence of parental role, parent personality, and child difficulties",2021,"As the segmentation labels are scarce, extensive researches have been conducted to train segmentation networks without labels or with only limited labels. In particular, domain adaptation, self-supervised learning, and teacher-student architecture have been introduced to distill knowledge from various tasks to improve the segmentation performance. However, these approaches appear different from each other, so it is not clear how these seemingly different approaches can be combined for better performance. Inspired by the recent StarGANv2 for multi-domain image translation, here we propose a novel segmentation framework via AdaIN-based knowledge distillation, where a single generator with AdaIN layers is trained along with the AdaIN code generator and style encoder so that the generator can perform both domain adaptation and segmentation. Specifically, our framework is designed to deal with difficult situations in chest X-ray (CXR) segmentation tasks where segmentation masks are only available for normal CXR data, but the trained model should be applied for both normal and abnormal CXR images. Since a single generator is used for abnormal to normal domain conversion and segmentation by simply changing the AdaIN codes, the generator can synergistically learn the common features to improve segmentation performance. Experimental results using CXR data confirm that the trained network can achieve the state-of-the art segmentation performance for both normal and abnormal CXR images.","Oh, Yujin; Ye, Jong Chul",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05892v2.pdf,636

[...]the coronavirus pandemic's effect that hit all parts of Indonesia did not include being able to disrupt the manufacturing and logistics related sectors in various countries such as China, Japan, and America. The storage capacity of the log data is substantial [6]. [...]it requires a long time due to the many verification documents that must be provided to all relevant departments to carry out the procurement of goods and services, resulting in the purchase of products and services experiencing a time delay and many procedural misuses. The process of filling goods and services needed in the activity data log will go through stages such as data extraction, preprocessing, discovery phase, conformity checking phase and placement phase, and analysis and evaluation by producing a new business process diagram model to provide adequate and timely decision direction [14]. Process conformance checking phase The purpose of the phase check process is to determine the fitness value of the casual matrix data using heuristic miners and produce a fitness and precision table where the activities that occur in the event log are related to the initial business model and the dependence of the model on process discovery.","Pane, Syafrial Fachri Awangga Rolly Maulana Siregar M.

Moreover, parents and children know they need help managing these circumstances. Perhaps for the first time, behavior analysts hold the reinforcers for increasing parental involvement in effective child-rearing practices. In fact, behavior analysts can help parents enlist their children in managing the household by framing their behavior in terms of hidden superpowers. In the current article, we argue that behavior analysts have a range of tools to offer that are grounded in evidence-based principles, strategies, and kernels-or essential units of behavioral influence. When combined into scheduled daily practices and invoked by children taught to see their use of the tools as nothing short of heroic, these practices function as ""vaccinations"" that inoculate families against toxic and unsafe behaviors.","Szabo, Thomas G; Richling, Sarah; Embry, Dennis D; Biglan, Anthony; Wilson, Kelly G",Behav Anal Pract,,636

Until vaccination becomes available, a bundle of effective preventive measures is desperately needed. Recent research is indicating the relevance of aerosols in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, in this study commercially available antiseptic mouthwashes based on the active ingredients chlorhexidine digluconate and octenidine dihydrochloride (OCT) were investigated regarding their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 using the European Standard 14476. Based on the requirement of EN 14476 in which reduction of at least four decimal logarithms (&#8805;4 log10) of viral titre is requested to state efficacy, the OCT-based formulation was found to be effective within a contact time of only 15 s against SARS-CoV-2. Based on this in-vitro data the OCT mouthwash thus constitutes an interesting candidate for future clinical studies to prove its effectiveness in a potential prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by aerosols.","Steinhauer, K; Meister, T L; Todt, D; Krawczyk, A; Paßvogel, L; Becker, B; Paulmann, D; Bischoff, B; Pfaender, S; Brill, F H H; Steinmann, E",J. hosp. infect,,636
232903,COVID-19 and telehealth: Applying telehealth and telemedicine in a pandemic,2021,"Immune-based therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy have revolutionized the landscape of cancer treatment in recent years. Although this class of therapy has demonstrated impressive clinical efficacy against cancers that were once thought to be incurable, its success is in part limited by unique toxicities which can be severe or even fatal. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is the most commonly observed toxicity and occurs as a result of non-antigen specific immune activation. Similar to macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)/hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), CRS is associated with elevated levels of several cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) that serve as a driver for host immune dysregulation. As a direct anti-cytokine drug, tocilizumab has been a cornerstone in the treatment of CAR-T-associated CRS through its ability to dampen CRS without compromising CAR-T-cell function. However, optimal timing of administration is yet unknown. Here, we review the use of tocilizumab in the management of CAR-T-associated CRS, emphasizing on the clinical efficacy across various CAR constructs and its role in current CRS management algorithms. We also discuss alternative therapies that may be considered for refractory CRS therapy and the use of tocilizumab in the current COVID-19 global pandemic.","Si, Stephanie; Teachey, David T",Ther Clin Risk Manag,,636

234527,In Science We Trust: The Effects of Information Sources on COVID-19 Risk Perceptions,2021,"PURPOSE: New York State (NYS) is an epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United States. Reliable estimates of cumulative incidence in the population are critical to tracking the extent of transmission and informing policies. METHODS: We conducted a statewide seroprevalence study in a 15,101 patron convenience sample at 99 grocery stores in 26 counties throughout NYS. SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence was estimated from antibody reactivity by first poststratification weighting and then adjusting by antibody test characteristics. The percent diagnosed was estimated by dividing the number of diagnoses by the number of estimated infection-experienced adults. RESULTS: Based on 1887 of 15,101 (12.5%) reactive results, estimated cumulative incidence through March 29 was 14.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.3%-14.7%), corresponding to 2,139,300 (95% CI: 2,035,800-2,242,800) infection-experienced adults. Cumulative incidence was highest in New York City 22.7% (95% CI: 21.5%-24.0%) and higher among Hispanic/Latino (29.2%), non-Hispanic black/African American (20.2%), and non-Hispanic Asian (12.4%) than non-Hispanic white adults (8.1%, P < .0001). An estimated 8.9% (95% CI: 8.4%-9.3%) of infections in NYS were diagnosed, with diagnosis highest among adults aged 55 years or older (11.3%, 95% CI: 10.4%-12.2%). CONCLUSIONS: From the largest U.S. serosurvey to date, we estimated >2 million adult New York residents were infected through late March, with substantial disparities, although cumulative incidence remained less than herd immunity thresholds. Monitoring, testing, and contact tracing remain essential public health strategies.","Rosenberg, Eli S; Tesoriero, James M; Rosenthal, Elizabeth M; Chung, Rakkoo; Barranco, Meredith A; Styer, Linda M; Parker, Monica M; John Leung, Shu-Yin; Morne, Johanne E; Greene, Danielle; Holtgrave, David R; Hoefer, Dina; Kumar, Jessica; Udo, Tomoko; Hutton, Brad; Zucker, Howard A",Ann Epidemiol,,636

The purpose of this study was to understand the visible and invisible potential challenges being faced by the 1st year medical and dental students while attending digital anatomy classes. METHODS: The present study was conducted on 81st year medical and dental students who were admitted to their respective college in August 2019 and were willing to participate in the study. A multiple choice close-ended questionnaire regarding their opinion on virtual classes was designed and feedback was taken from the students. RESULTS: Majority (65%) of the students agreed that they missed their traditional anatomy learning i.e., dissection courses, face to face lectures and interaction with mentors. The students strongly felt the lack of confidence and difficulty in the topics completed without dissections, models, microscopic slides and other modalities. 83% felt lack of proper gadgets, high-band width and strong internet connections, a potential barrier in their digital learning. Lack of self-motivation was felt by 69% students. CONCLUSIONS: The current situation of anatomy education is not intentional, and is not the long term silver bullet solution for a visual subject like anatomy. Though learners face a lot of challenges, however, a shift to online must be supported at this time of health crisis. As the digital learning may go for indefinite period, the feedback of students may be helpful for relevant and timely modifications in digital anatomy education.","Singal, Anjali; Bansal, Agam; Chaudhary, Priti; Singh, Harsimranjit; Patra, Apurba",,,636

Their mental health and future competences as citizens depend on the quality of care from foster parents and group home staff in nonparental care settings. Caregivers are challenged by poor work conditions, too many children, and a lack of knowledge about care for traumatized children. How can our profession match this challenge by upscaling interventions? Digital designs for applications of psychology are growing, recently accelerated by the COVID-19 crisis. From 2008, the author developed a blended learning intervention. In partnerships with nongovernmental organizations and government agencies, care recommendations from an international network of researchers are transformed into start-up seminars for staff, followed by a 6-month online classroom education. Students learn and practice how to train local caregiver groups in attachment-based care, using training sessions developed in local languages, adjusted to culture. At present, the author's Fairstart Foundation educated 500 staff from partners in 26 countries, who have trained the caregivers of some 40,000 children. The theoretical, logistic and technical steps from research to daily caregiver-child practices are described, to inspire discussions of how online designs and international partnerships may benefit underserved populations.

SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell and assembles a multisubunit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex of viral nonstructural proteins that plays a substantial role in the transcription and replication of the viral genome. Therefore, RdRp is among the most suitable targets in RNA viruses. Our aim was to investigate the FDA approved antiviral drugs having potential to inhibit the viral replication. The methodology adopted was virtual screening and docking of FDA-approved antiviral drugs into the RdRp protein. Top hits were selected and subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to understand the dynamics of RdRp in complex with these drugs. The antiviral activity of the drugs against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in Vero E6 cells. Notably, both remdesivir (half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) 6.6 µM, 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) > 100 µM, selectivity index (SI) = 15) and ledipasvir (EC50 34.6 µM, CC50 > 100 µM, SI > 2.9) exerted antiviral action.

A number of convergent findings suggest de-mono-ADP-ribosylation (de-MARylation) of STAT1 by the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 as a putative cause of the cytokine storm observed in the most severe cases of COVID-19. This may suggest new therapeutic approaches and help in designing assays to predict the virulence of naturally circulating SARS-like animal coronaviruses.","Claverie, Jean-Michel",Viruses,,636

In this chapter, we summarize recent studies using large public Twitter data sets on these issues. We have three primary objectives. First, we delineate epistemological and practical considerations when combining the traditions of computational research and social science research. A sensible balance should be struck when the stakes are high between advancing social theory and concrete, timely reporting of ongoing events. We additionally comment on the computational challenges of gleaning insight from large amounts of social media data. Second, we characterize the role of social bots in social media manipulation around the discourse on the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. Third, we compare results from 2020 to prior years to note that, although bot accounts still contribute to the emergence of echo-chambers, there is a transition from state-sponsored campaigns to domestically emergent sources of distortion. Furthermore, issues of public health can be confounded by political orientation, especially from localized communities of actors who spread misinformation. We conclude that automation and social media manipulation pose issues to a healthy and democratic discourse, precisely because they distort representation of pluralism within the public sphere.","Chang, Ho-Chun Herbert; Chen, Emily; Zhang, Meiqing; Muric, Goran; Ferrara, Emilio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08436v1.pdf,636

241054,Addiction and Covid-19 Disease: Risks and Misconceptions,2021,"Background: The incidence of acute myocardial infarction has decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but sex and age differences in this change in incidence have not been tested. Thus, we aimed to compare the incidence of acute myocardial infarction in a health-care region in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic with previous years and to evaluate sex and age differences. Methods: We did a retrospective, observational cohort study using data from a national registry of patients admitted to coronary care units in Sweden. All patients admitted to one of three hospitals in Region Jönköping County with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1 to July 31, 2020) or reference period (March 1 to July 31, 2017–19) were included. The incidence of acute myocardial infarction (ST-elevation and non-ST-elevation) was calculated for both study periods. Participants were grouped according to sex and age (&lt;70 years vs ≥70 years). The incidence and the incidence rate ratio (IRR) between the two study periods was calculated for each group and compared between groups using the Breslow-Day test. Findings: The study included 1088 participants, 846 who were admitted for acute myocardial infarction during the reference period and 242 who were admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The IRR of acute myocardial infarction for the COVID-19 period compared with the reference period was 0·85 (95% CI 0·73–0·98). The IRR for acute myocardial infarction was significantly lower among women aged 70 years or older (0·56 [0·40–0·78]) than among men aged 70 years or older (0·97 [0·77–1·23];p=0·0074). Interpretation: The incidence of acute myocardial infarction decreased predominantly among women aged 70 years or older during the COVID-19 pandemic. This highlights potential sex differences in health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which should be further elucidated. Funding: None. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is no directly effective antiviral drug application against respiratory viral pathogens; generally, the metaphylactic antibacterial drug applications are used for BRD. Ivermectin (IVM) is currently used as a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic agent both for veterinary and human medicine on some occasions. Moreover, since it is identified as an inhibitor for importin &#945;/ß-mediated nuclear localization signal (NLS), IVM is also reported to have antiviral potential against several RNA and DNA viruses. Since therapeutic use of IVM in COVID-19 cases has recently been postulated, the potential antiviral activity of IVM against bovine respiratory viruses including BRSV, BPIV-3, BoHV-1, BCoV and BVDV are evaluated in this study. For these purposes, virus titration assay was used to evaluate titers in viral harvest from infected cells treated with non-cytotoxic IVM concentrations (1, 2.5 and 5 µM) and compared to titers from non-treated infected cells. This study indicated that IVM inhibits the replication of BCoV, BVDV, BRSV, BPIV-3 and BoHV-1 in a dose-dependent manner in vitro as well as number of extracellular infectious virions. In addition, it was demonstrated that IVM has no clear effect on the attachment and penetration steps of the replication of the studied viruses. Finally, this study shows for the first time that IVM can inhibit infection of BRD-related viral agents namely BCoV, BPIV-3, BVDV, BRSV and BoHV-1 at the concentrations of 2.5 and 5 µM. Consequently, IVM, which is licensed for antiparasitic indications, also deserves to be evaluated as a broad-spectrum antiviral in BRD cases caused by viral pathogens.","Yesilbag, Kadir; Toker, Eda Baldan; Ates, Ozer",Virus Res,,636
243846,Hygienic Aspects of Lifestyle of Kharkiv National Medical University Junior Students in the Conditions of Quarantine,2021,"Automated Screening of COVID-19 from chest CT is of emergency and importance during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide in 2020. However, accurate screening of COVID-19 is still a massive challenge due to the spatial complexity of 3D volumes, the labeling difficulty of infection areas, and the slight discrepancy between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia in chest CT. While a few pioneering works have made significant progress, they are either demanding manual annotations of infection areas or lack of interpretability. In this paper, we report our attempt towards achieving highly accurate and interpretable screening of COVID-19 from chest CT with weak labels. We propose an attention-based deep 3D multiple instance learning (AD3D-MIL) where a patient-level label is assigned to a 3D chest CT that is viewed as a bag of instances. AD3D-MIL can semantically generate deep 3D instances following the possible infection area. AD3D-MIL further applies an attention-based pooling approach to 3D instances to provide insight into each instance's contribution to the bag label. AD3D-MIL finally learns Bernoulli distributions of the bag-level labels for more accessible learning. We collected 460 chest CT examples: 230 CT examples from 79 patients with COVID-19, 100 CT examples from 100 patients with common pneumonia, and 130 CT examples from 130 people without pneumonia. A series of empirical studies show that our algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 97.9%, AUC of 99.0%, and Cohen kappa score of 95.7%. These advantages endow our algorithm as an efficient assisted tool in the screening of COVID-19.","Han, Zhongyi; Wei, Benzheng; Hong, Yanfei; Li, Tianyang; Cong, Jinyu; Zhu, Xue; Wei, Haifeng; Zhang, Wei",IEEE Trans Med Imaging,,636

The aims of the current study were to examine trends in barbiturate-related deaths in Australia from 2000 to 2019 and determine the case characteristics and circumstances of barbiturate-related deaths. METHODS: All barbiturate-related deaths identified in the Australian National Coronial Information System were examined. Information was collected on cause, manner, demographics, location, psychosocial factors, circumstances of deaths and toxicology. We examined these based on the age categories 18-44 years, 45-64 years and &#8805;65 years. RESULTS: We identified 511 cases. Mean age was 57.9 years (SD 20.2, range 18-100) and 56% were male. Intentional poisoning was the most common cause of death (87.5%) and was slightly higher in the oldest age group (92.1%) and lowest in the youngest age group (81.1%). Pentobarbitone was the most common barbiturate (75.7%) and pentobarbitone-related deaths increased from 0% in 2000 to 93.6% in 2017. There were notable differences between age categories, with the youngest age group recording more severe psychiatric histories. In contrast, the oldest age group were more likely to have severe physical health problems, such as cancer, chronic non-cancer pain, neurological conditions and significant cardiopulmonary morbidity. Euthanasia resources were commonly documented (33.9%), most frequently in the oldest age group (52.3%). CONCLUSION: Barbiturate-related deaths in Australia are increasing, particularly pentobarbitone-related deaths. Most deaths were intentional and involved adults across the lifespan. Younger people were more likely to have significant mental health problems, whilst the oldest age group were more likely to have severe physical health conditions.","Campbell, G; Darke, S; Zahra, E; Duflou, J; Shand, F; Lappin, J",Clin Toxicol (Phila),,636
245446,Lessons for health service: The chernobyl accident and the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"This study describes the development of a simple and easy-to-build portable automated bag valve mask (BVM) compression system, which, during acute shortages and supply chain disruptions can serve as a temporary emergency ventilator. The resuscitation system is based on the Arduino controller with a real-time operating system installed on a largely RepRap 3-D printable parametric component-based structure. The cost of the materials for the system is under $170, which makes it affordable for replication by makers around the world. The device provides a controlled breathing mode with tidal volumes from 100 to 800 mL, breathing rates from 5 to 40 breaths/minute, and inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio from 1:1 to 1:4. The system is designed for reliability and scalability of measurement circuits through the use of the serial peripheral interface and has the ability to connect additional hardware due to the object-oriented algorithmic approach. Experimental results after testing on an artificial lung for peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), respiratory rate (RR), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), tidal volume, proximal pressure, and lung pressure demonstrate repeatability and accuracy exceeding human capabilities in BVM-based manual ventilation. Future work is necessary to further develop and test the system to make it acceptable for deployment outside of emergencies such as with COVID-19 pandemic in clinical environments, however, the nature of the design is such that desired features are relatively easy to add using protocols and parametric design files provided.","Petsiuk, Aliaksei; Tanikella, Nagendra G.; Dertinger, Samantha; Pringle, Adam; Oberloier, Shane; Pearce, Joshua M.",HardwareX,,636

245807,Changes in Lifestyle and Dietary Habits during COVID-19 Lockdown in Italy: Results of an Online Survey,2021,"Introduction: A new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes a respiratory distress syndrome that has been called COVID-19 and has generated an unprecedented pandemic. Serious complications include pneumonia, and mortality ranges from 2 to 5%. Until March 26, the World Health Organization reports 462 684 confirmed cases and 20 834 deaths worldwide. Dissemination occurs from aerosols or respiratory droplets. Different scientific societies have published clinical practice guidelines regarding ophthalmic care in the COVID-19 pandemic, but the information is presented inconsistently, which makes decision-making difficult. Methods: We conducted a sensitive bibliographic search in EMBASE and ophthalmic society webpages, of the clinical practice guidelines of ophthalmic care in pandemic COVID-19. We extracted the recommendations, organizing them into three categories: ""Which patients to attend"", ""How should the clinic work"", and ""What interventions should be avoided"". For each guideline, we assessed whether the search was systematic and whether the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was followed. Results: Fourteen relevant articles were found. Fifty-one recommendations were extracted and are shown in a summary table. None are based on a systematic search for evidence, nor do any use GRADE to develop the recommendations. Conclusions: The clinical practice guidelines that we reviewed all recommend rescheduling all non-urgent consultations and surgeries, reinforcing contact precautions, the use of personal protection elements, and the disinfection of surfaces and instruments. The guidelines should be improved by incorporating systematic searches for evidence, using GRADE for recommendations, and Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) for reporting.","Vargas-Peirano, Manuel; Navarrete, Pamela; Díaz, Traccy; Iglesias, Gabriel; Hoehmann, Martin",Medwave,,636

246639,COVID-19 IDD: A global survey exploring family members' and paid staff's perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their caregivers,2020,"A detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of plant stress resistance in the face of ever-changing environmental stimuli will be helpful for promoting the growth and production of crop and forage plants. Investigations of plant responses to various single abiotic or biotic factors, or combined stresses, have been extensively reported. However, the molecular mechanisms of plants in responses to environmental stresses under natural conditions are not clearly understood. In this study, we carried out a transcriptome analysis using RNA-sequencing to decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms of Onobrychis viciifolia responding and adapting to the extreme natural environment in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). The transcriptome data of plant samples collected from two different altitudes revealed a total of 8212 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 5387 up-regulated and 2825 down-regulated genes. Detailed analysis of the identified DEGs uncovered that up-regulation of genes potentially leading to changes in hormone homeostasis and signaling, particularly abscisic acid-related ones, and enhanced biosynthesis of polyphenols play vital roles in the adaptive processes of O. viciifolia. Interestingly, several DEGs encoding uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases, which putatively regulate phytohormone homeostasis to resist environmental stresses, were also discovered. Furthermore, numerous DEGs encoding transcriptional factors, such as members of the myeloblastosis (MYB), homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP), WRKY, and nam-ataf1,2-cuc2 (NAC) families, might be involved in the adaptive responses of O. viciifolia to the extreme natural environmental conditions. The DEGs identified in this study represent candidate targets for improving environmental stress resistance of O. viciifolia grown in higher altitudes of the QTP, and can provide deep insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the responses of this plant species to the extreme natural environmental conditions of the QTP.","Yin, Hengxia; Zhou, Huakun; Wang, Wenying; Tran, Lam-Son Phan; Zhang, Benyin",Biomolecules,,636

247080,Disability Rights Concerns and Clinical Triage Protocol Development During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"To study concepts that are coded in language, researchers often collect lists of conceptual properties produced by human subjects. From these data, different measures can be computed. In particular, inter-concept similarity is an important variable used in experimental studies. Among possible similarity measures, the cosine of conceptual property frequency vectors seems to be a de facto standard. However, there is a lack of comparative studies that test the merit of different similarity measures when computed from property frequency data. The current work compares four different similarity measures (cosine, correlation, Euclidean and Chebyshev) and five different types of data structures. To that end, we compared the informational content (i.e., entropy) delivered by each of those 4 × 5 = 20 combinations, and used a clustering procedure as a concrete example of how informational content affects statistical analyses. Our results lead us to conclude that similarity measures computed from lower-dimensional data fare better than those calculated from higher-dimensional data, and suggest that researchers should be more aware of data sparseness and dimensionality, and their consequences for statistical analyses.","Canessa, Enrique; Chaigneau, Sergio E; Moreno, Sebastián; Lagos, Rodrigo",,,636

We sought to provide information on differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes between male and female patients and to explore the effect of estrogen in disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Method: In this retrospective, multi-center study, we included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 admitted to four hospitals in Hubei province, China from Dec 31, 2019 to Mar 31, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analyzed for demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiographic parameters. Random-effect logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between sex and disease outcomes. Results: A total of 2501 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included in the present study. The clinical manifestations of male and female patients with COVID-19 were similar, while male patients have more comorbidities than female patients. In terms of laboratory findings, compared with female patients, male patients were more likely to have lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, inflammatory response, hypoproteinemia, and extrapulmonary organ damage. Random-effect logistic regression analysis indicated that male patients were more likely to progress into severe type, and prone to ARDS, secondary bacterial infection, and death than females. However, there was no significant difference in disease outcomes between postmenopausal and premenopausal females after propensity score matching (PSM) by age. Conclusions: Male patients, especially those age-matched with postmenopausal females, are more likely to have poor outcomes. Sex-specific differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes do exist in patients with COVID-19, but estrogen may not be the primary cause. Further studies are needed to explore the causes of the differences in disease outcomes between the sexes.","Wang, Mengdie; Jiang, Nan; Li, Changjun; Wang, Jing; Yang, Heping; Liu, Li; Tan, Xiangping; Chen, Zhenyuan; Gong, Yanhong; Yin, Xiaoxv; Zong, Qiao; Xiong, Nian; Zhang, Guopeng",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,636
248054,Scare in a medical college lessons to be learn an Indian perspective of COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a national lockdown in India from midnight on 25 March 2020, with conditional relaxation by phases and zones from 20 April. We evaluated the impact of the lockdown in terms of healthcare provisions, physical health, mental health and social well-being within a multicentre cross-sectional study in India. METHODS: The SMART India study is an ongoing house-to-house survey conducted across 20 regions including 11 states and 1 union territory in India to study diabetes and its complications in the community. During the lockdown, we developed an online questionnaire and delivered it in English and seven popular Indian languages (Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Telegu, Kannada, Bengali, Malayalam) to random samples of SMART-India participants in two rounds from 5 May 2020 to 24 May 2020. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the overall impact on health and healthcare provision in phases 3 and 4 of lockdown in red and non-red zones and their interactions. RESULTS: A total of 2003 participants completed this multicentre survey. The bivariate relationships between the outcomes and lockdown showed significant negative associations. In the multivariable analyses, the interactions between the red zones and lockdown showed that all five dimensions of healthcare provision were negatively affected (non-affordability: OR 1.917 (95% CI 1.126 to 3.264), non-accessibility: OR 2.458 (95% CI 1.549 to 3.902), inadequacy: OR 3.015 (95% CI 1.616 to 5.625), inappropriateness: OR 2.225 (95% CI 1.200 to 4.126) and discontinuity of care: OR 6.756 (95% CI 3.79 to 12.042)) and associated depression and social loneliness. CONCLUSION: The impact of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on health and healthcare was negative. The exaggeration of income inequality during lockdown can be expected to extend the negative impacts beyond the lockdown.","Raman, Rajiv; Rajalakshmi, Ramachandran; Surya, Janani; Ramakrishnan, Radha; Sivaprasad, Sobha; Conroy, Dolores; Thethi, Jitendra Pal; Mohan, V; Netuveli, Gopalakrishnan",BMJ Open,,636
248395,COPD Management during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Repurposing approved drugs may rapidly establish effective interventions during a public health crisis. This has yielded immunomodulatory treatments for severe COVID-19, but repurposed antivirals have not been successful to date because of redundancy of the target in vivo or suboptimal exposures at studied doses. Nitazoxanide is an FDA approved antiparasitic medicine, that physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling has indicated may provide antiviral concentrations across the dosing interval, when repurposed at higher than approved doses. Within the AGILE trial platform (NCT04746183) an open label, adaptive, phase 1 trial in healthy adult participants was undertaken with high dose nitazoxanide. Participants received 1500mg nitazoxanide orally twice-daily with food for 7 days. Primary outcomes were safety, tolerability, optimum dose and schedule. Intensive pharmacokinetic sampling was undertaken day 1 and 5 with Cmin sampling on day 3 and 7. Fourteen healthy participants were enrolled between 18th February and 11th May 2021. All 14 doses were completed by 10/14 participants. Nitazoxanide was safe and well tolerated with no significant adverse events. Moderate gastrointestinal disturbance (loose stools) occurred in 8 participants (57.1%), with urine and sclera discolouration in 12 (85.7%) and 9 (64.3%) participants, respectively, without clinically significant bilirubin elevation. This was self-limiting and resolved upon drug discontinuation. PBPK predictions were confirmed on day 1 but with underprediction at day 5. Median Cmin was above the in vitro target concentration on first dose and maintained throughout. Nitazoxanide administered at 1500mg BID with food was safe and well tolerated and a phase 1b/2a study is now being initiated in COVID-19 patients.","Walker, Lauren E; FitzGerald, Richard; Saunders, Geoffrey; Lyon, Rebecca; Fisher, Michael; Martin, Karen; Eberhart, Izabela; Woods, Christie; Ewings, Sean; Hale, Colin; Rajoli, Rajith KR; Else, Laura; Dilly-Penchala, Sujan; Amara, Alieu; Lalloo, David G; Jacobs, Michael; Pertinez, Henry; Hatchard, Parys; Waugh, Robert; Lawrence, Megan; Johnson, Lucy; Fines, Keira; Reynolds, Helen; Rowland, Timothy; Crook, Rebecca; Byrne, Kelly; Mozgunov, Pavel; Jaki, Thomas; Khoo, Saye; Owen, Andrew; Griffiths, Gareth; Fletcher, Thomas E",,,636
249610,Development and Potential Usefulness of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip Diagnostic Assay in a Pandemic Context,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several criteria have been described to noninvasively predict the presence of high-risk esophageal varices in patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD). However, a recent study showed that treatment with ß blockers could increase decompensation-free survival in patients with clinically significant portal hypertension, thereby making it important to predict the presence of any esophageal varices. We aimed to develop a simple scoring system to predict any esophageal varices. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who had vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) at Cook County Hospital, Chicago, USA. Patients with cACLD and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) &#8805; 10 kPa with esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed within one year of VCTE were analyzed. We generated a novel score to predict esophageal varices, using the beta coefficient of predictive variables. The score was validated in an external cohort at the University of Iowa Hospital, USA. RESULTS: There were 372 patients in the development cohort and 200 patients in the validation cohort. LSM, platelet count, and albumin were identified as predictors of esophageal varices and were included for generating the Cook County score as ""platelet count * - 0.0155872 + VCTE score * 0.0387052 + albumin * - 0.8549209."" The area under receiver operating curve for our score was 0.86 for any varices and 0.85 for high risk varices and avoided more endoscopies than the expanded Baveno VI criteria while maintaining a very low miss rate (negative predictive value > 99%). CONCLUSION: We propose a new, highly accurate, and easy-to-use scoring system to predict the presence of not only high-risk but any esophageal varices in patients with cACLD.","Kotwal, Vikram; Mbachi, Chimezie; Wang, Yuchen; Attar, Bashar; Randhawa, Tejinder; Flores, Estefania; Robles, Julian; Rosenstengle, Craig; Demetria, Melchor; Adeyemi, Oluwatoyin; Huhn, Gregory; Murali, Arvind R",Dig. dis. sci,,636

METHODS: The prospective open non-randomized interventional study (Siena Eye-Cross Study 2) included 156 eyes of 112 patients with early progressive KC undergoing the Epi-Off 9 mW/5.4 J/cm2 ACXL at the Siena Crosslinking Centre, Italy. The mean age was 18.05 ± 5.6 years. The 20-min treatments were performed using the New KXL I (Avedro, Waltham, USA), 10 min of 0.1% HPMC Riboflavin soaking (VibeX Rapid, Avedro, Waltham, USA) and 10 min of continuous-light UV-A irradiation. Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), Kmax, coma, minimum corneal thickness (MCT), surface asymmetry index (SAI), endothelial cell count (ECC) were measured, and corneal OCT performed. RESULTS: UDVA and CDVA improved significantly at the 3rd (P = 0.028), &#916; + 0.17 Snellen lines and 6th postoperative month, respectively (P < 0.001), &#916; + 0.23 Snellen lines. Kmax improved at the 6th postoperative month (P = 0.03), &#916; - 1.49 diopters from the baseline value. Also, coma aberration value improved significantly (P = 0.004). A mild temporary haze was recorded in 14.77% of patients without affecting visual acuity and without persistent complications. Corneal OCT revealed a mean demarcation line depth at 332.6 ± 33.6 µm. CONCLUSION: The 5-year results of Epi-Off 9 mW/5.4 J/cm2 ACXL demonstrated statistically significant improvements in UCVA and CDVA, corneal curvature and corneal higher-order aberrations which confers a long-term stability for progressive ectasia. Based on the results of the Siena Eye-Cross Study 2, the 9 mW/5.4 J/cm2 ACXL is a candidate to be the natural evolution of Epi-Off CXL treatment for the management of early progressive corneal ectasia, and thus optimize clinic workflow.","Mazzotta, Cosimo; Raiskup, Frederik; Hafezi, Farhad; Torres-Netto, Emilio A; Armia Balamoun, Ashraf; Giannaccare, Giuseppe; Bagaglia, Simone Alex",Eye Vis (Lond),,636
250859,Evidence-Based Supported Employment in the Rural United States: Challenges and Adaptations,2021,"BACKGROUND: The 30-day readmission rate is an important indicator of patient safety and hospital's quality performance. In this study, we aimed to find out the 30-day readmission rate of mild and moderate severity COVID-19 patients discharged from a tertiary care university hospital and to demonstrate the possible factors associated with readmission. METHODS: This is an observational, single-center study. Epidemiological and clinical data of patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were retrieved from a research database where patient information was recorded prospectively. Readmission data was sought from the hospital information management system and National Health Record System to detect if the patients were readmitted to any hospital within 30 days of discharge. Adult patients (&#8805;18 years-old) hospitalized in COVID-19 wards with a diagnosis of mild or moderate COVID-19 between March 20, 2020 (when the first case was admitted to our hospital), and April 26, 2020 were included. RESULTS: From March 26 to May 1, there were 154 mild or moderate severity (non-critical) COVID-19 patients discharged from COVID-19 wards, of which 11 (7.1%) were readmitted The median time of readmission was 8.1 days (IQR=5.2). Two patients (18.1%) were categorized to have mild disease and the remaining 9 (81.9%) as moderate disease. Two patients who were over 65 years of age and had metastatic cancers and hypertension developed sepsis and died in the hospital during the readmission episode. Malignancy (18.7% vs 2.1%, P = 0.04) and hypertension (45.5% vs 14%, P = 0.02) were more common in those who were readmitted.

251264,Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients Living With Vasculitis,2020,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has been declared an international public health emergency, and it may have long-lasting effects on people’s mental health. There is a need to identify effective health behaviors to mitigate the negative mental health impact of COVID-19. Objective: The objectives of this study were to (1) examine the regional differences in mental health and COVID-19–related worry, attention to news, and stress, in light of the state-level prevalence of COVID-19 cases;(2) estimate the associations between mental health and COVID-19–related worry, attention to news, and stress and health behavior engagement (ie, physical activity, mindfulness meditation);and (3) explore the mediating effect of health behavior engagement on the associations between mental health and COVID-19–related worry, attention to news, and stress. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to a sample of US adult paying subscribers to the Calm app (data were collected from April 22 to June 3, 2020). The survey assessed COVID-19–related worry, attention to news, and stress;health behavior engagement;and mental health (ie, perceived stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety and depression). Statistical analyses were performed using R software. Differences in COVID-19–related worry, attention to news, and stress and mental health by location were assessed using t tests and chi-square tests. Logistic and ordinary least squares models were used to regress mental health and health behavior on COVID-19–related worry, attention to news, and stress;moreover, causal mediation analysis was used to estimate the significance of the mediation effects. Results: The median age of the respondents (N=8392) was 47 years (SD 13.8). Participants in the Mid-Atlantic region (New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania) reported higher levels of stress, more severe depression symptoms, greater worry about COVID-19, paying more attention to COVID-19–related news, and more stress related to social distancing recommendations than participants living in other regions. The association between worry about COVID-19 and perceived stress was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P&lt;.001), strength of meditation habit (P&lt;.001), and stopping meditation (P=.046). The association between worry about COVID-19 and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P&lt;.001) and strength of meditation habit (P&lt;.001). Conclusions: Our findings describe the mental health impact of COVID-19 and outline how continued participation in health behaviors such as physical activity and mindfulness meditation reduce worsening of mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These data have important implications for public health agencies and health organizations to promote the maintenance of health habits to reduce the residual mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Green, Jennifer Huberty Jennifer Puzia Megan Stecher Chad",JMIR Mental Health,,636

251669,Impact of COVID-19 damage on Japanese monkeys survey in Fukushima,2021,"Recently, Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) researchers have paid lots of attentions on the conversational robots that can provide didactic or pedagogy teachings, especially for the children and young adolescents with cognitive disabilities, such as autism and epilepsy. The research and developments of such robots for educational purposes are investigated intensively. Above all the difficult challenges, how to evaluate the effectiveness of a conversational robot, which mimics a teacher communicating with a student, to improve the performance of learning and studying, is the key factor to deploy such robots in our society and be widely adopted. However, we haven't seen much investigation in previous literatures so far. In order to bridge the gap, this preliminary study had explored the use of conversational robot with electroencephalogram (EEG) biosignals as evidence measurements to improve the self-learning performance during COVID-19 pandemic crisis, while the schools are forced to close, and the students are inevitably segregated in social isolations. We had collected 10 student participants' EEG data, which were calculated to find concentration levels, and then the robot had conversations with the students adaptively according to his/her concentration levels. The result showed that the conversations between robot and humans, who are constantly not concentrating on the learning tasks, could effectively increase his/her level of concentrations. © 2021 IEEE.","Wang, K.

252277,Self-sampling in Human Papillomavirus screening during and post-COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic imposed a drastic reduction in surgical activity in order to respond to the influx of hospital patients and to protect uninfected patients by avoiding hospitalization. However, little is known about the risk of infection during hospitalization or its consequences. The aim of this work was to report a series of patients hospitalized on digestive surgery services who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 virus. METHODS: This is a non-interventional retrospective study carried out within three departments of digestive surgery. The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 were collected from the computerized medical record. RESULTS: From March 1, 2020 to April 5, 2020, among 305 patients admitted to digestive surgery departments, 15 (4.9%) developed evident nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2. There were nine men and six women, with a median age of 62 years (35-68 years). All patients had co-morbidities. The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n=5), complex emergencies (n=5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n=3), gastroplasty (n=1), and stoma closure (n=1). The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection was 34 days (5-61 days). In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15-63 days). At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were still hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk. Measures are necessary to minimize this risk in order to return to safe surgical activity.","Luong-Nguyen, M; Hermand, H; Abdalla, S; Cabrit, N; Hobeika, C; Brouquet, A; Goéré, D; Sauvanet, A",J Visc Surg,,636

253037,"Summary of adverse drug events for hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and chloroquine during the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Kidney cancers account for about 2% of human malignancies. In recent decades, the incidence of this cancer type has gradually increased, mainly due to advances in imaging. The metastatic potential of these cancers is significant: a quarter of patients will immediately present with metastases and more than one third of patients treated with nephrectomy for a localized disease will develop metastases during their course. In total, more than half of patients will suffer from the consequences of metastasis. The median survival at this stage is only thirteen months, so the therapeutic challenge is immense. CASE REPORT: The present case report describes a case of left renal clear cell carcinoma with brain, lung, right adrenal, bone and lymph node metastases in a 55-year-old male. The patient received only one line of anticancer treatment with sunitinib, which could not be continued due to haemorrhagic manifestations in brain metastases. The treatment was changed with immunotherapy which showed its effect even if it was stopped due to the patient wishes in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSION: Immunotherapy opens the doors to a new era in treatment of metastatic renal cancer and shows efficiency even after it has been stopped.","Haineala, Bogdan; Zgura, Anca; Diaconu, Camelia; Mehedintu, Claudia; Bacinschi, Xenia; Anghel, Rodica Maricela",In Vivo,,636
253096,A Knowledge Distillation Ensemble Framework for Predicting Short and Long-term Hospitalisation Outcomes from Electronic Health Records Data,2020-11-18,"Introduction: COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip, an immunochromatographic (ICT) assay for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen on nasopharyngeal specimen, has been developed to identify positive COVID-19 patients allowing prompt clinical and quarantine decisions. In this original research article, we describe the conception, the analytical and clinical performances as well as the risk management of implementing the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip in a diagnostic decision algorithm. Materials and Methods: Development of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip resulted in a ready-to-use ICT assay based on a membrane technology with colloidal gold nanoparticles using monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highly conserved nucleoprotein antigen. Four hundred observations were recorded for the analytical performance study and thirty tests were analyzed for the cross-reactivity study. The clinical performance study was performed in a retrospective multi-centric evaluation on aliquots of 328 nasopharyngeal samples. COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip results were compared with qRT-PCR as golden standard for COVID-19 diagnostics. Results: In the analytical performance study, the reproducibility showed a between-observer disagreement of 1.7%, a robustness of 98%, an overall satisfying user friendliness and no cross-reactivity with other virus-infected nasopharyngeal samples. In the clinical performance study performed in three different clinical laboratories during the ascendant phase of the epidemiological curve, we found an overall sensitivity and specificity of 57.6 and 99.5%, respectively with an accuracy of 82.6%. The cut-off of the ICT was found at CT &lt;22. User-friendliness analysis and risk management assessment through Ishikawa diagram demonstrate that COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip may be implemented in clinical laboratories according to biosafety recommendations. Conclusion: The COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip represents a promising rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay for the first-line diagnosis of COVID-19 in 15 min at the peak of the pandemic. Its role in the proposed diagnostic algorithm is complementary to the currently-used molecular techniques.","Mertens, Pascal; De Vos, Nathalie; Martiny, Delphine; Jassoy, Christian; Mirazimi, Ali; Cuypers, Lize; Van den Wijngaert, Sigi; Monteil, Vanessa; Melin, Pierrette; Stoffels, Karolien; Yin, Nicolas; Mileto, Davide; Delaunoy, Sabrina; Magein, Henri; Lagrou, Katrien; Bouzet, Justine; Serrano, Gabriela; Wautier, Magali; Leclipteux, Thierry; Van Ranst, Marc; Vandenberg, Olivier",Front.

253484,Missouri State Medical Association's COVID-19 Pandemic Presidency,2021,"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged from China causing pneumonia outbreaks, first in the Wuhan region of China and then spread worldwide because of its probable high transmission efficiency. Owing to the lack of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug repurposing appears to be the best tool to find a therapeutic solution. Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin and ritonavir have shown efficacy to inhibit coronavirus in vitro. Teicoplanin, an antibiotic used to treat staphylococcal infections, previously showed efficacy to inhibit the first stage of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) viral life cycle in human cells. This activity is conserved against SARS-Cov-2, thus placing teicoplanin as a potential treatment for patients with this virus.","Baron, Sophie Alexandra; Devaux, Christian; Colson, Philippe; Raoult, Didier; Rolain, Jean-Marc",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,636

Therefore, we investigated the role of anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders for levels and longitudinal changes of COVID-19-related fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. In a longitudinal observational design with four assessment waves from March, 27th until June, 15th 2020, a total of 6,551 adults from Germany was assessed. 4,175 individuals participated in one, 1,070 in two, 803 in three, and 503 in all four waves of data collection. Multilevel analyses revealed that across all assessment waves, COVID-19-related fear, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were significantly higher in individuals with vs. without anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders. All symptoms decreased on average over time, and this decrease was significantly stronger in individuals with vs. without anxiety disorders, and particularly driven by individuals with generalized anxiety disorder. Our findings suggest that individuals with mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders - and in particular those with a generalized anxiety disorder - seem to be vulnerable to experience psychological strain in the context of the pandemic, might likely overestimate potential threat, and should be targeted by preventive and therapeutic interventions.","Bendau, Antonia; Kunas, Stefanie Lydia; Wyka, Sarah; Petzold, Moritz Bruno; Plag, Jens; Asselmann, Eva; Ströhle, Andreas",J Anxiety Disord,,636

The availability of genomes in the public domain after the epidemic provides a unique opportunity to understand the evolution and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus across the globe. Methods: We performed whole-genome sequencing of 303 Indian isolates, and we analyzed them in the context of publicly available data from India. Results: We describe a distinct phylogenetic cluster (Clade I/A3i) of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India, which encompasses 22% of all genomes deposited in the public domain from India. Globally, approximately 2% of genomes, which to date could not be mapped to any distinct known cluster, fall within this clade. Conclusions: The cluster is characterized by a core set of 4 genetic variants and has a nucleotide substitution rate of 1.1â ×â 10-3 variants per site per year, which is lower than the prevalent A2a cluster. Epidemiological assessments suggest that the common ancestor emerged at the end of January 2020 and possibly resulted in an outbreak followed by countrywide spread.

257243,Global Ophthalmology Practice Patterns during COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown,2021,"BACKGROUND: The body adiposity index (BAI), uses anthropometry to estimate percent body fat (%F). However, previous studies have shown that the BAI has limited accuracy for children and adolescents. OBJECTIVE: We propose to develop and validate an adjusted BAI for use in male children and adolescents from 7 to 17 years of age. METHODS: The sample consisted of 141 physically active male children and adolescents (age: 12.5 ± 2.14). The %F was determined by X-ray dual energy absorptometry equipment (DXA) as the standard method and by BAI, using an equation that uses height and hip circumference. Arithmetic modeling was used to adjust the structure of the BAI mathematical model. RESULTS: The BAI arithmetic adjustment was successful, resulting in the mathematical model named in the present study of adjusted body adiposity index (BAIADJ ). BAI and BAIADJ correlated with DXA (r &#8804; .70, p < .001). Regression analyzes indicate that, BAI (CI 95% ß: [1.35; 1.90], p < .0001) and BAIADJ (CI 95% ß: [1.40; 1.90], p < .0001) have the potential to estimate %F. BAI pointed out a difference in relation to DXA (p = .04). While there was no difference between BAIADJ and DXA (p = .1). There was a proportion bias of 13.2% for BAI (p < .05), but not for BAIADJ (p > .05). CONCLUSION: The adjusted model of the body adiposity index proves to be an effective tool for the analysis of the fat percentage in young males. In addition, it demonstrated significant degrees of agreement and validity in relation to DXA.","de Macêdo Cesário, Tatianny; de Almeida-Neto, Paulo Francisco; de Matos, Dihogo Gama; Wells, Jonathan; Aidar, Felipe J; da Costa, Roberto Fernandes; de Araújo Tinoco Cabral, Breno Guilherme",Am J Hum Biol,,636

Training activities, conferences, lectures, face-to-face workshops were suspended until the Health Situation was over. Alternatives to face-to-face training were needed to guarantee the continuity of these activities. Online training, teaching and evaluation emerged as a relatively fast, simple, operational and flexible solution. Universities and faculties promoted online teaching through virtual classes. The Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy supported this initiative by signing an agreement with the Board of Deans and Chancellors of Pharmacy to make it possible for undergraduate students to continue their studies and supervised practices in hospital pharmacy departments. Specialized training was affected. Pharmacy residency programs were significantly modified by hospital pharmacies to be able to provide the new clinical and research activities required, everyday, by the pandemic situation. Postgraduate and residency training were also negatively affected. Again, online activities made up for restrictions to face-to-face teaching and training. The Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy promoted continuing education and provided updated information on the SARS-CoV-2 virus through its website. Thus, numerous virtual sessions, lectures and webinars have been held, and high-quality material was offered to provide up-todate knowledge, on the pharmacological management of patients with COVID-19. Online teaching and education has demonstrated to be an invaluable tool for hard times. During the lockdown, technology has kept us closer and has emerged as an ally. Many of us have found a new means of communication, information, and training. The Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy has substantially contributed to make it possible.","Soy-Muner, Dolors",Farm Hosp,,636
258787,The Influence of Factors Such as Parenting Stress and Social Support on the State Anxiety in Parents of Special Needs Children During the COVID-19 Epidemic,2020,"Air pollution is linked to higher rates of human mortality especially those infected with COVID 19. Ozone is a harmful pollutant and is responsible for many health issues. However, some reports suggest that ozone is a strong disinfectant, and can kill the viruses. We hereby, report on the vulnerability of ozone due to COVID-19 lockdown whose levels flutter from surging to saturation in a highly polluted Indian capital, due to significant decline in anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors. Average observed levels stabilized at 30 ppb, 12 ppb, 740 ppb, and 900 ppb for ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) respectively during lockdown period from 27th March to 10th April 2020. The NO2, CO and VOC declined by 50 %, 37 %, 38 % respectively during the lockdown period of 2020 as compared to similar period in 2019. The anomalous response of ozone during the lockdown is explained by resolving the poorly known complex O3-NOx-VOCs mechanism with the help of data from air monitoring stations in Delhi, India. The data obtained from this study advances the fundamental understanding of ozone chemistry that may lead to improved ozone parameterization in chemical transport models and better planning of ozone risk management strategies for any global mega cities.","Rathod, A; Sahu, S K; Singh, S; Beig, G",Heliyon,,636

One means to address this question is to review our understanding of the physical mechanisms by which masks and coverings operate-steric interception, inertial impaction, diffusion, and electrostatic capture We enquire as to what extent these can be used to predict the efficacy of coverings We combine the predictions of the models of these mechanisms which exist in the filtration literature and compare the predictions with recent experiments and lattice Boltzmann simulations, and find reasonable agreement with the former and good agreement with the latter Building on these results, we explore the parameter space for woven cotton fabrics to show that three-layered cloth masks can be constructed with comparable filtration performance to surgical masks under ideal conditions Reusable cloth masks thus present an environmentally friendly alternative to surgical masks so long as the face seal is adequate enough to minimize leakage","Robinson, J.

We developed a set of 10 improved molecular assays for surveillance of GC-AMR and prediction of susceptibilities in NAAT specimens. METHODS: Multiplex real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assays were developed to detect SNPs associated with cephalosporin (ponA, porB, mtrR -35delA, penA A311V, penA A501, N513Y, G545S), ciprofloxacin (gyrA S91, parC D86/S87/S88) and azithromycin [23S (A2059G, C2611T), mtrR meningitidis-like promoter] resistance. The assays were validated on 127 gonococcal isolates, 51 non-gonococcal isolates and 50 NAATs with matched culture isolates. SNPs determined from the assay were compared with SNPs determined from in silico analysis of WGS data. MICs were determined for culture isolates using the agar dilution method. RESULTS: SNP analysis of the 50 NAAT specimens had 96% agreement with the matched culture RT-PCR analysis. When compared with MICs, presence of penA A311V or penA A501 and two or more other SNPs correlated with decreased susceptibility and presence of three or more other SNPs correlated with intermediate susceptibility to cephalosporins; presence of any associated SNP correlated with ciprofloxacin or azithromycin resistance. NAAT-AMR predictions correlated with matched-culture cephalosporin, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin MICs at 94%, 100% and 98%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We expanded molecular tests for N. gonorrhoeae AMR prediction by adding new loci and multiplexing reactions to improve surveillance where culture isolates are unavailable.","Peterson, S W; Martin, I; Demczuk, W; Barairo, N; Naidu, P; Lefebvre, B; Allen, V; Hoang, L; Hatchette, T F; Alexander, D; Tomas, K; Trubnikov, M; Wong, T; Mulvey, M R",J. antimicrob. chemother,,636

Effective ART reduces morbidity and mortality rates among persons with HIV infection and prevents HIV transmission once viral load is suppressed to undetectable levels (2,3). In April 2019, through the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR),* CDC launched an 18-month ART Surge program in nine Nigerian states to rapidly increase the number of persons with HIV infection receiving ART. CDC analyzed programmatic data gathered during March 31, 2019-September 30, 2020, to describe the ART Surge program's progress on case finding, ART initiation, patient retention, and ART Surge program growth. Overall, the weekly number of newly identified persons with HIV infection who initiated ART increased approximately eightfold, from 587 (week ending May 4, 2019) to 5,329 (week ending September 26, 2020). The ART Surge program resulted in 208,202 more HIV-infected persons receiving PEPFAR-supported ART despite the COVID-19 pandemic (97,387 more persons during March 31, 2019-March 31, 2020 and an additional 110,815 persons during April 2020-September 2020). Comprehensive, data-guided, locally adapted interventions and the use of incident command structures can help increase the number of persons with HIV infection who receive ART, reducing HIV-related morbidity and mortality as well as decreasing HIV transmission.","Dirlikov, Emilio; Jahun, Ibrahim; Odafe, Solomon F; Obinna, Ogbanufe; Onyenuobi, Chibuzor; Ifunanya, Mgbakor; Efuntoye, Timothy A; Tingir, Nguhemen; Ene, Uzoma; Fagbemi, Ayodele; Meribe, Chidozie; Bassey, Orji; Ayo, Adeola; Fagbamigbe, Omodele Johnson; Amafah, Joy; Bamidele, Moyosola; Alagi, Matthias; Oladipo, Ademola; Dalhatu, Ibrahim; Okoye, McPaul; Onotu, Dennis; Gwamna, Jerry; Abrams, William A; Conner, Deborah A; Nwaohiri, Anuli; Carpenter, Deborah; Ijeoma, Ugonna C; Shah, Sarita; Tison, Laura I; Shah, Minesh; Chun, Helen; Williams-Sherlock, Michelle; Boyd, Andrew T; Bachanas, Pamela; Ikpeazu, Akudo; Aliyu, Gambo Gumel; Ellerbrock, Tedd; Swaminathan, Mahesh",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,636

261122,"The ""Labeled"" Side of COVID-19 in India: Psychosocial Perspectives on Islamophobia During the Pandemic",2020,"PURPOSE: Over the past few decades maternal mortality has progressively declined because of improved management of the major obstetric problems of hemorrhage, infection, and toxemia. As a result, the relative incidence of deaths resulting from non obstetric causes has increased. Chief among nonobstetric causes are neurologic disorders. Those most common during pregnancy are low back pain, intracranial tumors, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and neurotrauma. The management of the neurosurgical pathologies during pregnancy needs some specifications for both the mother and the fetus. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study evaluating the clinical, radiological, and surgical characteristics of 9 patients who have cranial neuropathologies and have undergone neurosurgical intervention. RESULTS: Most of the patients in this study had vaginal delivery. Prominent neurosurgical disease related to cerebral damage. Every patient underwent a laboratory and radiological evaluation. All except one survived the neurosurgical pathology. Neither baby nor mother had significant problem during delivery and neurosurgical intervention. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women may face to every kind of neurosurgical pathology that nonpregnant women have faced. In addition, pregnancy itself, gives rise some metabolic changes in the women and those changes may cause some neurologic pathologies to be symptomatic or to aggravate the present symptomatology. Because of those reasons, close neurologic follow up of a pregnant woman is of vital importance. At the end of a pregnancy having experienced some neurologic interventions including diagnostic evaluation or surgical intervention does not necessitates the cesarean section for a neurologically intact infant and mother.","Cirak, Bayram; Kiymaz, Nejmi; Kerman, Memduh; Tahta, Kadir",Acta cir. bras.,,636
261313,Analysis of self-concept in adolescents before and during COVID-19 lockdown: differences by gender and sports activity,2020,"Many health care systems around the world continue to struggle with large numbers of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, while others have diminishing numbers of cases following an initial surge. There will most likely be significant oscillations in numbers of cases for the foreseeable future, based on the regional epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Less affected hospitals and facilities will attempt to progressively resume elective procedures and surgery. Ramping up elective care in hospitals that deliberately curtailed elective care to focus on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients will present unique and serious challenges. Among the challenges will be protecting patients and providers from recurrent outbreaks of disease while increasing procedure throughput. Anesthesia providers will inevitably be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by patients who have not been diagnosed with infection. This is particularly concerning in consideration that aerosols produced during airway management may be infective. In this article, we recommend an approach to routine anesthesia care in the setting of persistent but variable prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We make specific recommendations for personal protective equipment and for the conduct of anesthesia procedures and workflow based on evidence and expert opinion. We propose practical, relatively inexpensive precautions that can be applied to all patients undergoing anesthesia. Because the SARS-CoV-2 virus is spread primarily by respiratory droplets and aerosols, effective masking of anesthesia providers is of paramount importance. Hospitals should follow the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for universal masking of all providers and patients within their facilities. Anesthesia providers should perform anesthetic care in respirator masks (such as N-95 and FFP-2) whenever possible, even when the SARS-CoV-2 test status of patients is negative. Attempting to screen patients for infection with SARS-CoV-2, while valuable, is not a substitute for respiratory protection of providers, as false-negative tests are possible and infected persons can be asymptomatic or presymptomatic. Provision of adequate supplies of respirator masks and other respiratory protection equipment such as powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) should be a high priority for health care facilities and for government agencies. Eye protection is also necessary because of the possibility of infection from virus coming into contact with the conjunctiva. Because SARS-CoV-2 persists on surfaces and may cause infection by contact with fomites, hand hygiene and surface cleaning are also of paramount importance.","Bowdle, Andrew; Jelacic, Srdjan; Shishido, Sonia; Munoz-Price, L Silvia",Anesth Analg,,636
261605,Network study of responses to unusualness and psychological stress during the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea,2021,"It is often of interest to use observational data to estimate the causal effect of a target exposure or treatment on an outcome. When estimating the treatment effect, it is essential to appropriately adjust for selection bias due to observed confounders using, for example, propensity score weighting. Selection bias due to confounders occurs when individuals who are treated are substantially different from those who are untreated with respect to covariates that are also associated with the outcome. A comparison of the unadjusted, naive treatment effect estimate with the propensity score adjusted treatment effect estimate provides an estimate of the selection bias due to these observed confounders. In this article, we propose methods to identify the observed covariate that explains the largest proportion of the estimated selection bias. Identification of the most influential observed covariate or covariates is important in resource-sensitive settings where the number of covariates obtained from individuals needs to be minimized due to cost and/or patient burden and in settings where this covariate can provide actionable information to healthcare agencies, providers, and stakeholders. We propose straightforward parametric and nonparametric procedures to examine the role of observed covariates and quantify the proportion of the observed selection bias explained by each covariate. We demonstrate good finite sample performance of our proposed estimates using a simulation study and use our procedures to identify the most influential covariates that explain the observed selection bias in estimating the causal effect of alcohol use on progression of Huntington's disease, a rare neurological disease.","Parast, Layla; Griffin, Beth Ann",Stat. med,,636

We explored the ways occupational health nurses can use social media as a helpful resource as well as identified potential concerns associated with its use. Methods: A review of the literature was conducted between December 1, 2019, and April 10, 2020, using PubMed and Google Scholar. Key search terms included social media, social network, nurse or nursing, occupational health, and online health. Criteria for selection included studies with results on social media within health care, nursing, and/or occupational health. Studies were also included if the health effects of social media were addressed. Six additional studies that had been previously identified by hand searching were included. Findings: These findings support the use of social media in occupational health for encouraging participatory health care among employees. Occupational health nurses can also utilize social media for health information, online health communities, emergency communication, health education workshops, professional connections, and continuing education. However, awareness of safe social media practice is necessary due to the possibility of misinformation and privacy breaches. Conclusion/Application to Practice: Social media can be used for education and communication with employees and is a way to support employees with specific health conditions through participation in online health communities . Occupational health nurses can take advantage of the speed and accessibility of social media to reach large numbers of employees. It is also a useful tool for addressing many health concerns encountered by employees; however, careful sourcing of information, awareness of company policies, and other safe practices can help to ensure it is helpful and not harmful.","Siegmund, Lee Anne",Workplace Health Saf,,636

However, the exact effect of TRAF6 on gastric cancer stem cells has not been extensively studied. In this study, abnormal expression of TRAF6 was found in gastric cancer tissues. Overexpression of TRAF6 enhanced proliferation and migration, and TRAF6 knockdown reversed this phenomenon in gastric cancer cells. Moreover, TRAF6 may inhibit differentiation and promote stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Transcriptome profiles revealed 701 differentially expressed genes in the wild-type group and the TRAF6 knockout group. Potential molecules associated with cell proliferation and migration were identified, including MAPK, FOXO, and IL-17.

265076,PNS14 Direct Medical Costs Related to COVID-19 in Colombia,2021,"Endophytic fungi have proven to be prolific producers of bioactive secondary metabolites with agricultural applications. In this study, bioassay-guided isolation of the endophytic fungus Acremonium vitellinum yielded four anthraquinone derivatives (compounds 1-4), including a previously undescribed dimethylated derivative of bipolarin, 6,8-di-O-methylbipolarin (1). Their structures were determined by 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance analysis as well as high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry data, and the absolute configuration of 1 was established by comparing the calculated and experimental electronic circular dichroism spectra. The insecticidal activity of the isolated compounds against the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera was evaluated. The new compound 1 showed the strongest larvicidal activity against the 3rd instar larvae of H. armigera with an LC50 value of 0.72 mg/mL. In addition, transcriptome sequencing was performed to evaluate the molecular mechanism of the insecticidal activity. In total, 5732 differentially expressed genes were found, among which 2904 downregulated genes and 2828 upregulated genes were mainly involved in cell autophagy, apoptosis, and DNA mismatch repair and replication. The results presented in this study reveal how 1 exerts its insecticidal effects against H. armigera via genome-wide differential gene expression analyses. Our findings suggest that anthraquinone derivatives are potential biopesticides for cotton bollworm control.","Yuan, Xiao-Long; Wang, Xiu-Fang; Xu, Kuo; Li, Wei; Chen, Dan; Zhang, Peng",J Agric Food Chem,,636
265625,School teachers: the forgotten frontline workers of Covid-19,2021,"Naturally occurring phenanthroindolizidine and phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids (PIAs and PQAs) are two small groups of herbal metabolites sharing a similar pentacyclic structure with a highly oxygenated phenanthrene moiety fused with a saturated or an unsaturated N-heterocycle (indolizidine/quinolizidine moieties). Natural PIAs and PQAs only could be obtained from finite plant families (such as Asclepiadaceae, Lauraceae and Urticaceae families, etc.). Up to date, more than one hundred natural PIAs, while only nine natural PQAs had been described. PIA and PQA analogues have been applied to the development of potent anticancer agents all along because of their excellent cytotoxic activity. However, in the last two decades, other great biological properties, such as anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities were revealed successively by different pharmacological assays. Especially because of their potent antiviral activity against coronavirus (TGEV, SARS CoV and MHV) and tobacco mosaic virus, PIA and PQA analogues have attracted much pharmaceutical attention again, some of them have been used to present interesting targets for total or semi synthesis, and structure-activity relationship (SAR) study for the development of antiviral agents. In this review, natural PIA and PQA analogues obtained in the last two decades with their herbal origins, key spectroscopic characteristics for structural identification, biological activity with possible SARs and application prospects were systematically summarized. We hope this paper can stimulate further investigations on PIA and PQA analogues as an important source for potential drug discovery.","Jia, Xian-Hui; Zhao, Huan-Xin; Du, Cheng-Lin; Tang, Wen-Zhao; Wang, Xiao-Jing",Phytochem Rev,,636

Considering that many microbes evade innate immune mechanisms to initiate infection, and in light of the discovery of epigenetically mediated innate immune training, the paradigm of vaccine design has the potential to change. The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine induces some level of protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) while stimulating trained immunity that correlates with lower mortality and increased protection against unrelated pathogens. This review will explore BCG-induced trained immunity, including the required pathways to establish this phenotype. Additionally, potential methods to improve or expand BCG trained immunity effects through alternative vaccine delivery and formulation methods will be discussed. Finally, advances in new anti-Mtb vaccines, other antimicrobial uses for BCG, and ""innate memory-based vaccines"" will be examined.","Pasco, Samuel T; Anguita, Juan",,,636
266921,"The link between fear about COVID-19 and insomnia: Mediated by economic concerns and psychological distress, moderated by mindfulness",2021,"Introduction. Laboratories worldwide are facing high demand for molecular testing during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, which might be further aggravated by the upcoming influenza season in the northern hemisphere.Gap Statement. Given that the symptoms of influenza are largely indistinguishable from those of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), both SARS-CoV-2 and the influenza viruses require concurrent testing by RT-PCR in patients presenting with symptoms of respiratory tract infection.Aim. We adapted and evaluated a laboratory-developed multiplex RT-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 (dual target), influenza A and influenza B (SC2/InflA/InflB-UCT) on a fully automated high-throughput system (cobas6800).Methodology. Analytical performance was assessed by serial dilution of quantified reference material and cell culture stocks in transport medium, including pretreatment for chemical inactivation. For clinical evaluation, residual portions of 164 predetermined patient samples containing SARS-CoV-2 (n=52), influenza A (n=43) or influenza B (n=19), as well as a set of negative samples, were subjected to the novel multiplex assay.Results. The assay demonstrated comparable analytical performance to currently available commercial tests, with limits of detection of 94.9 cp ml-1 for SARS-CoV-2, 14.6 cp ml-1 for influenza A and 422.3 cp ml-1 for influenza B. Clinical evaluation showed excellent agreement with the comparator assays (sensitivity of 98.1, 97.7 and 100â% for Sars-CoV-2 and influenza A and B, respectively).Conclusion. The SC2/InflA/InflB-UCT allows for efficient high-throughput testing for all three pathogens and thus provides streamlined diagnostics while conserving resources during the influenza season.","Nörz, Dominik; Hoffmann, Armin; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Pfefferle, Susanne; Lütgehetmann, Marc",J. medical microbiol,,636

Currently, in Germany over 140,000 cases of COVID-19 are confirmed. Here we report a nosocomial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the pediatric dialysis unit of the University Hospital of Münster (UHM). METHODS: Single-step real-time RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swaps was used to diagnose the index patient and identify infected contacts. Epidemiological links were analyzed by patient interviews and chart reviews. In addition, each contact was assessed for exposure to the index case and monitored for clinical symptoms. Threshold cycle (Ct) values of all positive test results were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. RESULTS: Forty-eight cases were involved in this nosocomial outbreak. Nine contact cases developed laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infections. Two SARS-CoV-2 positive cases remained clinically asymptomatic. Eleven cases reported flu-like symptoms without positive results. Ct values were significantly lower in cases presenting typical COVID-19 symptoms, suggesting high viral shedding (p =0.007). CONCLUSION: Person-to-person transmission was at the heart of a hospital outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients in the pediatric dialysis unit at the UHM. Semi quantitative real-time RT-PCR results suggest that individuals with high viral load pose a risk to spread SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting. Our epidemiological observation highlights the need to develop strategies to trace and monitor SARS-CoV-2 infected HCWs in order to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in the hospital setting.","Schwierzeck, Vera; König, Jens Christian; Kühn, Joachim; Mellmann, Alexander; Correa-Martínez, Carlos Luis; Omran, Heymut; Konrad, Martin; Kaiser, Thomas; Kampmeier, Stefanie",Clin. infect. dis,,636
267465,A universal generic description of the dynamics of the current COVID-19 pandemic,2020-07-06,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spain has been one of the countries heavily stricken by COVID-19. But this epidemic has not affected all regions equally. We analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital stroke admissions and in-hospital mortality in tertiary referral hospitals from North-West Spain. METHODS: Spanish multicenter retrospective observational study based on data from tertiary hospitals of the NORDICTUS network. We recorded the number of patients admitted for ischemic stroke between 30 December 2019 and 3 May 2020, the number of IVT and EVT procedures, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: In the study period, 2737 patients were admitted with ischemic stroke. There was a decrease in the weekly mean admitted patients during the pandemic (124 vs. 173, p<0.001). In-hospital mortality of stroke patients increased significantly (9.9% vs. 6.5%, p = 0.003), but there were no differences in the proportion of IVT (17.3% vs. 16.1%, p = 0.405) or EVT (22% vs. 23%, p = 0.504). CONCLUSION: We found a decrease in the number of ischemic stroke admissions and an increase in in-hospital mortality during the COVID-19 epidemic in this large study from North-West Spain.

The need to promote effective Training Programs also reflects the job satisfaction needs of trainees. The objective of this study is to evaluate the trainees’ satisfaction with the quality of Training Programs and assess the degree of achievement based on the defined parameters to provide baseline data based on which strategies for improvement can be formulated. Our study was conducted in Saudi Arabia and our targeted population was residents in medical programs supervised by the Saudi Commission for the Health Specialties (SCFHS). The trainees’ response rate to the online survey was 27% (3696/13,688) and the key aspects of job satisfaction investigated include: Satisfaction with Academic Activities in the Center;Satisfaction with the Residents and Colleagues in the Center;Satisfaction with the Administrative Components in the Center;Satisfaction with the Training Programs;Satisfaction with the Specialty;Satisfaction with the Training Center;Satisfaction with the SCFHS. The main contribution of our work is a benchmark model for job satisfaction that can be used as a managerial tool for the enhancement of medical education with reference to the satisfaction of trainees. We analyze the key aspects and components of training satisfaction and we introduce our progressive model for Trainees’ Satisfaction in Medical Training. In future work, we intend to enhance the proposed framework with a set of key performance indicators as well as with a focused cause and effect focused survey on factors related to the key benchmark of this study.","Housawi, Abdulrahman Amal Al Amoudi Alsaywid Basim Lytras Miltiadis bin Μoreba Yara H.; Abuznadah, Wesam Munshi Fadi Sami Al Haider Tolah Abrar W.",Sustainability,,636

The DFT method at B3LYP/6-31 + G (d,p) level of theory was used. Reactivity indices, transition structures theory, IGM and ELF analysis were employed to reveal the mechanism of the reaction. The addition of DZM to PSH takes place through a one-step mechanism and an asynchronous transition states. Eight possible addition channels of reaction were investigated (addition of C (sp2) to Diazomethane at C4, C5, C6 or C7). The addition of C (sp2) at C5 leading to P1 product is the preferred channel. The addition of ether does not affect the chemo-, regio- and stereo-selectivity of the reaction. Analysis of transfer of charges along the IRC path associated with the P1 product shows a polar character for the studied reaction. We have also used the noncovalent interaction (NCI) which is very helpful to reveal the most favored addition channel of the reaction, by analyzing the weak interactions in different TSs.

This study aimed to explore the key parameters of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to assess the effectiveness of interventions to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-asymptomatic-recovered (SEIAR) model was developed for the assessment. The information of each confirmed case and asymptomatic infection was collected from Ningbo Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to calculate the key parameters of the model in Ningbo City, China. A total of 157 confirmed COVID-19 cases (including 51 imported cases and 106 secondary cases) and 30 asymptomatic infections were reported in Ningbo City. The proportion of asymptomatic infections had an increasing trend. The proportion of elder people in the asymptomatic infections was lower than younger people, and the difference was statistically significant (Fisher's Exact Test, P = 0.034). There were 22 clusters associated with 167 SARS-CoV-2 infections, among which 29 cases were asymptomatic infections, accounting for 17.37%. We found that the secondary attack rate (SAR) of asymptomatic infections was almost the same as that of symptomatic cases, and no statistical significance was observed (&#967;2 = 0.052, P = 0.819) by Kruskal-Wallis test. The effective reproduction number (Reff) was 1.43, which revealed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was moderate. If the interventions had not been strengthened, the duration of the outbreak would have lasted about 16 months with a simulated attack rate of 44.15%. The total attack rate (TAR) and duration of the outbreak would increase along with the increasing delay of intervention. SARS-CoV-2 had moderate transmissibility in Ningbo City, China. The proportion of asymptomatic infections had an increase trend. Asymptomatic infections had the same transmissibility as symptomatic infections. The integrated interventions were implemented at different stages during the outbreak, which turned out to be exceedingly effective in China.","Lao, Xuying; Luo, Li; Lei, Zhao; Fang, Ting; Chen, Yi; Liu, Yuhui; Ding, Keqin; Zhang, Dongliang; Wang, Rong; Zhao, Zeyu; Rui, Jia; Zhu, Yuanzhao; Xu, Jingwen; Wang, Yao; Yang, Meng; Yi, Bo; Chen, Tianmu",Sci Rep,,636

Since its outset, efforts have been made to guide the rapid generation of research in medicine. There are gaps in some areas of rehabilitation research for patients with COVID-19. The development of a specific research framework might serve to help monitor the status of research (mapping), shape and strengthen research by pointing to under-investigated areas, and promote rehabilitation research in this context. This article introduces and discusses the COVID-19 Rehabilitation Research Framework (CRRF) and presents the methodology used for its development. The questions have been developed among the World Health Organization (WHO) Rehabilitation Programme, Cochrane Rehabilitation, and the experts of its Rehabilitation-COVID-19 Evidence-based Response Action International Multiprofessional Steering Committee. The framework is divided into 2 parts and includes 20 questions organized in 4 groups: epidemiology, and evidence at the micro- (individual), meso- (health services), and macro- (health systems) levels. The CRRF offers a comprehensive view of the research areas relevant to COVID-19 and rehabilitation that are necessary to inform best practice and ensure rehabilitation services and health systems can best serve the population with COVID-19. The collaboration between Cochrane Rehabilitation and the WHO Rehabilitation Programme in establishing the CRRF brought together perspectives from the health systems, health management, and clinical evidence.

270061,Challenges and Opportunities for enhanced cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT-E) in light of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Opinion polls on vaccination intentions suggest that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is increasing worldwide; however, the usefulness of opinion polls to prepare mass vaccination campaigns for specific new vaccines and to estimate acceptance in a country's population is limited. We therefore aimed to assess the effects of vaccine characteristics, information on herd immunity, and general practitioner (GP) recommendation on vaccine hesitancy in a representative working-age population in France. METHODS: In this survey experiment, adults aged 18-64 years residing in France, with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, were randomly selected from an online survey research panel in July, 2020, stratified by gender, age, education, household size, and region and area of residence to be representative of the French population. Participants completed an online questionnaire on their background and vaccination behaviour-related variables (including past vaccine compliance, risk factors for severe COVID-19, and COVID-19 perceptions and experience), and were then randomly assigned according to a full factorial design to one of three groups to receive differing information on herd immunity (>50% of adults aged 18-64 years must be immunised [either by vaccination or infection]; >50% of adults must be immunised [either by vaccination or infection]; or no information on herd immunity) and to one of two groups regarding GP recommendation of vaccination (GP recommends vaccination or expresses no opinion). Participants then completed a series of eight discrete choice tasks designed to assess vaccine acceptance or refusal based on hypothetical vaccine characteristics (efficacy [50%, 80%, 90%, or 100%], risk of serious side-effects [1 in 10â000 or 1 in 100â000], location of manufacture [EU, USA, or China], and place of administration [GP practice, local pharmacy, or mass vaccination centre]). Responses were analysed with a two-part model to disentangle outright vaccine refusal (irrespective of vaccine characteristics, defined as opting for no vaccination in all eight tasks) from vaccine hesitancy (acceptance depending on vaccine characteristics). FINDINGS: Survey responses were collected from 1942 working-age adults, of whom 560 (28·8%) opted for no vaccination in all eight tasks (outright vaccine refusal) and 1382 (71·2%) did not. In our model, outright vaccine refusal and vaccine hesitancy were both significantly associated with female gender, age (with an inverted U-shaped relationship), lower educational level, poor compliance with recommended vaccinations in the past, and no report of specified chronic conditions (ie, no hypertension [for vaccine hesitancy] or no chronic conditions other than hypertension [for outright vaccine refusal]). Outright vaccine refusal was also associated with a lower perceived severity of COVID-19, whereas vaccine hesitancy was lower when herd immunity benefits were communicated and in working versus non-working individuals, and those with experience of COVID-19 (had symptoms or knew someone with COVID-19). For a mass vaccination campaign involving mass vaccination centres and communication of herd immunity benefits, our model predicted outright vaccine refusal in 29·4% (95% CI 28·6-30·2) of the French working-age population. Predicted hesitancy was highest for vaccines manufactured in China with 50% efficacy and a 1 in 10â000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 27·4% [26·8-28·0]), and lowest for a vaccine manufactured in the EU with 90% efficacy and a 1 in 100â000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 61·3% [60·5-62·1]). INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 vaccine acceptance depends on the characteristics of new vaccines and the national vaccination strategy, among various other factors, in the working-age population in France.

This study has attempted to make an overall description and analysis of this phenomenon by collecting credible data from the field, news, and reports published by the emergency centers and the Iranian Ministry of Health. The investigations showed that in May 20, 2020, more than 6150 people have been affected by methanol poisoning from whom 804 deaths have been reported. A major cause of the increased rate of alcohol poisoning in this period was actually the illusion that alcohol could eliminate the coronaviruses having entered the body. It is of utmost importance that all mass media try to dismiss the cultural, religious, and political considerations and prepare convincing programs to openly discuss the side-effects of forged alcohol consumption with the public, especially with the youth. It must be clearly specified that ""consuming alcohol cannot help prevent COVID-19.""","Heidari, Mohammad; Sayfouri, Nasrin",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,636

271218,Oscillometry-A reasonable option to monitor lung functions in the era of COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: In epidemics of highly infectious diseases, such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or coronavirus (COVID-19), healthcare workers (HCW) are at much greater risk of infection than the general population, due to their contact with patients' contaminated body fluids. Personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce the risk by covering exposed body parts. It is unclear which type of PPE protects best, what is the best way to put PPE on (i.e. donning) or to remove PPE (i.e. doffing), and how to train HCWs to use PPE as instructed. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate which type of full-body PPE and which method of donning or doffing PPE have the least risk of contamination or infection for HCW, and which training methods increase compliance with PPE protocols. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL to 20 March 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all controlled studies that evaluated the effect of full-body PPE used by HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases, on the risk of infection, contamination, or noncompliance with protocols. We also included studies that compared the effect of various ways of donning or doffing PPE, and the effects of training on the same outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in included trials. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses were appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Earlier versions of this review were published in 2016 and 2019. In this update, we included 24 studies with 2278 participants, of which 14 were randomised controlled trials (RCT), one was a quasi-RCT and nine had a non-randomised design. Eight studies compared types of PPE. Six studies evaluated adapted PPE. Eight studies compared donning and doffing processes and three studies evaluated types of training. Eighteen studies used simulated exposure with fluorescent markers or harmless microbes. In simulation studies, median contamination rates were 25% for the intervention and 67% for the control groups. Evidence for all outcomes is of very low certainty unless otherwise stated because it is based on one or two studies, the indirectness of the evidence in simulation studies and because of risk of bias. Types of PPE The use of a powered, air-purifying respirator with coverall may protect against the risk of contamination better than a N95 mask and gown (risk ratio (RR) 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.43) but was more difficult to don (non-compliance: RR 7.5, 95% CI 1.81 to 31.1). In one RCT (59 participants), people with a long gown had less contamination than those with a coverall, and coveralls were more difficult to doff (low-certainty evidence). Gowns may protect better against contamination than aprons (small patches: mean difference (MD) -10.28, 95% CI -14.77 to -5.79). PPE made of more breathable material may lead to a similar number of spots on the trunk (MD 1.60, 95% CI -0.15 to 3.35) compared to more water-repellent material but may have greater user satisfaction (MD -0.46, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.08, scale of 1 to 5). Modified PPE versus standard PPE The following modifications to PPE design may lead to less contamination compared to standard PPE: sealed gown and glove combination (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78), a better fitting gown around the neck, wrists and hands (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55), a better cover of the gown-wrist interface (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78, low-certainty evidence), added tabs to grab to facilitate doffing of masks (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80) or gloves (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31). Donning and doffing Using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for doffing may lead to less contamination compared to no guidance (small patches: MD -5.44, 95% CI -7.43 to -3.45). One-step removal of gloves and gown may lead to less bacterial contamination (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.77) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28) than separate removal. Double-gloving may lead to less viral or bacterial contamination compared to single gloving (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28). Additional spoken instruction may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -0.9, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.4) and to fewer contamination spots (MD -5, 95% CI -8.08 to -1.92). Extra sanitation of gloves before doffing with quaternary ammonium or bleach may decrease contamination, but not alcohol-based hand rub. Training The use of additional computer simulation may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7). A video lecture on donning PPE may lead to better skills scores (MD 30.70, 95% CI 20.14 to 41.26) than a traditional lecture. Face-to-face instruction may reduce noncompliance with doffing guidance more (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98) than providing folders or videos only. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found low- to very low-certainty evidence that covering more parts of the body leads to better protection but usually comes at the cost of more difficult donning or doffing and less user comfort, and may therefore even lead to more contamination. More breathable types of PPE may lead to similar contamination but may have greater user satisfaction. Modifications to PPE design, such as tabs to grab, may decrease the risk of contamination. For donning and doffing procedures, following CDC doffing guidance, a one-step glove and gown removal, double-gloving, spoken instructions during doffing, and using glove disinfection may reduce contamination and increase compliance. Face-to-face training in PPE use may reduce errors more than folder-based training. We still need RCTs of training with long-term follow-up. We need simulation studies with more participants to find out which combinations of PPE and which doffing procedure protects best. Consensus on simulation of exposure and assessment of outcome is urgently needed. We also need more real-life evidence. Therefore, the use of PPE of HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases should be registered and the HCW should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection.","Verbeek, Jos H; Rajamaki, Blair; Ijaz, Sharea; Sauni, Riitta; Toomey, Elaine; Blackwood, Bronagh; Tikka, Christina; Ruotsalainen, Jani H; Kilinc Balci, F Selcen",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,636
271456,The impact of covid-19 on business: how to deal with it,2020,"In this paper, I argue that genetic screening for beta thalassemia major is ethically justified in the context of Vietnam. First, I differentiate genetic screening from the moral objections commonly associated with eugenics on the basis of the primary motive for screening (avoidance of suffering) and the preservation of voluntary choice. To lay the groundwork for ethical discussion, I explain the basics of beta thalassemia biochemistry and screening and the clinical picture of beta thalassemia major. I then elaborate on a specific example of the challenges of beta thalassemia major in Cyprus before moving on to the case of Vietnam and discuss the improbability of treatment for this disorder in Vietnam and therefore, the extensive suffering that it causes the Vietnamese people. This leads to my argument that a beta thalassemia screening in Vietnam would hold up the ethical principle of nonmaleficence and also preserves and enhances reproductive choice. I then propose that Vietnam's successful COVID-19 response can be used as a roadmap for beta thalassemia screening.","Riquier, Mai-Tram",,,636

Providing RRT for this large number of patients is proving challenging, and so alternatives to continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) in the intensive care unit (ICU) are needed. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) can be initiated immediately after percutaneous insertion of the catheter, but there are concerns about impact on ventilation and RRT efficacy. We sought to describe our recent experience with percutaneous catheter insertion and peritoneal dialysis in patients in the ICU with COVID-19 infection. Method: Patients were selected according to local protocol, and catheters were inserted percutaneously by experienced operators using a Seldinger technique. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and ventilation requirements were recorded at the time of insertion and 24 hours later. Procedural complications, proportion of RRT provided by PD, renal recovery, and RRT parameters (serum potassium and maximum base excess) during PD were assessed. Results: Percutaneous PD catheters were successfully inserted in 37 of 44 patients (84.1%) after a median of 13.5 days (interquartile range [IQR] = 10.0, 20.3 days) in the ICU. No adverse events were reported; SOFA scores and ventilation requirements were comparable before and after insertion; and adequate RRT parameters were achieved. The median proportion of RRT provided by PD following catheter insertion was 94.6% (IQR = 75.0, 100%). Conclusion: Peritoneal dialysis provides a safe and effective alternative to CRRT in selected patients with AKI and COVID-19 infection requiring ventilation on intensive care.","Bowes, Elaine; Joslin, Jennifer; Braide-Azikiwe, Dandisonba C B; Tulley, Caroline; Bramham, Kate; Saha, Sujit; Jayawardene, Satish; Shakoane, Babakang; Wilkins, C Jason; Hutchings, Sam; Hopkins, Philip; Lioudaki, Eirini; Shaw, Catriona; Cairns, Hugh; Sharpe, Claire C",,,636

273686,"Consequences of COVID-19 Confinement on Anxiety, Sleep and Executive Functions of Children and Adolescents in Spain",2021,"COVID-19 is reducing the ability to perform surgical procedures worldwide, giving rise to a multitude of ethical, practical and medical dilemmas. Adapting to crisis conditions requires a rethink of traditional best practices in surgical management, delving into an area of unknown risk profiles. Key challenging areas include cancelling elective operations, modifying procedures to adapt local services and updating the consenting process. We aim to provide an ethical rationale to support change in practice and guide future decision-making. Using the four principles approach as a structure, Medline was searched for existing ethical frameworks aimed at resolving conflicting moral duties. Where insufficient data were available, best guidance was sought from educational institutions: National Health Service England and The Royal College of Surgeons. Multiple papers presenting high-quality, reasoned, ethical theory and practice guidance were collected. Using this as a basis to assess current practice, multiple requirements were generated to ensure preservation of ethical integrity when making management decisions. Careful consideration of ethical principles must guide production of local guidance ensuring consistent patient selection thus preserving equality as well as quality of clinical services. A critical issue is balancing the benefit of surgery against the unknown risk of developing COVID-19 and its associated complications. As such, the need for surgery must be sufficiently pressing to proceed with conventional or non-conventional operative management; otherwise, delaying intervention is justified. For delayed operations, it is our duty to quantify the long-term impact on patients' outcome within the constraints of pandemic management and its long-term outlook.","Macleod, Jack; Mezher, Sermed; Hasan, Ragheb",J Med Ethics,,636

However, whether this dominant variant can potentially spread through the cold chain and whether the spike protein affects virus stability after cold storage remain unclear. To compare the infectivity of two SARS-CoV-2 variants, namely, SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike protein with the D614 mutation (S-D614) and G614 mutation (S-G614), after different periods of refrigeration (4°C) and freezing (-20°C). We also determined the integrity of the viral RNA and the ability of the spike protein to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) after storage at these conditions. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was more stable and infectious after storage at -20°C than at 4°C. Particularly, the S-G614 variant was found to be more stable than the S-D614 variant. The spike protein of the S-G614 variant had better binding ability with the ACE2 receptor than that of the S-D614 variant after storage at -20°C for up to 30 days. Our findings revealed that SARS-CoV-2 remains stable and infectious after refrigeration or freezing, and their stability and infectivity up to 30 days depends on the spike variant. Stability and infectivity are related to each other, and the higher stability of S-G614 compared to that of S-D614 may contribute to rapid viral spread of the S-G614 variant.IMPORTANCE It has been observed that variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are more stable and infectious after storage at -20°C than at 4°C. A SARS-CoV-2 S-D614G variant is currently the most dominant variant in circulation and is associated with enhanced infectivity. We compared the stability of two SARS-CoV-2 variants: the early S-D614 variant carrying the D614 spike protein and the new S-G614 variant carrying the G614 spike protein, stored at both 4°C and -20°C for different periods. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 remains stable and infectious after refrigeration or freezing, which further depends on the spike variant, that is, the ability of the spike protein to bind with the ACE2 receptor with higher efficiency. The high stability of the S-G614 variant also explains its rapid spread and infectivity. Therefore, precautions should be taken during and after handling food preserved under cold conditions.","Huang, Sheng-Yu; Kung, Yu-An; Huang, Peng-Nien; Chang, Sheng-Yun; Gong, Yu-Nong; Han, Yi-Ju; Chiang, Huan-Jung; Liu, Kuan-Ting; Lee, Kuo-Ming; Chang, Chia-Yu; Chang, Chia-Ching; Huang, Chung-Guei; Shih, Shin-Ru",MSphere,,636

STUDY DESIGN: There were 207 parents of children with disabilities who completed a web-based survey about their child[ren]'s access to, and satisfaction with, therapy services during COVID-19. Parents also completed the Family-Provider Partnership Scale and the Telehealth Satisfaction Scale. Satisfaction was compared between families receiving therapies in school, early intervention, outpatient, and multiple settings. RESULTS: Forty-four percent of parents reported low satisfaction with their child[ren]'s therapy services during the pandemic. Access to telehealth positively predicted overall satisfaction and satisfaction with the family-provider partnership, whereas receiving school-based therapies negatively predicted overall satisfaction and satisfaction with the family-provider partnership. CONCLUSIONS: School-based therapies are legally mandated for eligible students, free of cost to families, integrated in the academic setting, and less burdensome on parents than other services. Thus, given the disparity in parental satisfaction regarding school-based service delivery, addressing therapy delivery in school-based settings during the duration of COVID-19 is critical for preventing increased disparities and more effectively meeting children's needs. Telehealth seems to be a promising option for continuing high-quality services during the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and for families who face barriers in accessing services in general. Future studies are warranted with larger and more diverse samples, as well as longitudinal studies that monitor service access and parent satisfaction throughout the remainder of the pandemic.","Murphy, Ashley; Pinkerton, Linzy M; Bruckner, Ellie; Risser, Heather J",J. pediatr.

Small studies have shown an effect of glucocorticoids on inflammatory marker levels, but definitive proof is lacking. We investigated the influence of prednisone on inflammatory biomarkers in a previous placebo-controlled, randomized-controlled multicenter trial which compared a 7-day treatment course of 50 mg prednisone to placebo in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We compared levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), leukocyte and neutrophil count between patients with and without glucocorticoid treatment at baseline and on days 3, 5, 7, and at discharge by Wilcoxon tests and variance analysis. 356 patient data sets in the prednisone group and 355 in the placebo group were available for analysis. Compared to placebo, use of prednisone was associated with reductions in levels of CRP on days 3, 5, and 7, (mean difference of 46%, p < 0.001 for each time point). For PCT, no such difference was observed. Leukocyte and neutrophil count were higher in the prednisone group at all time points (mean difference of 27% for leukocytes and 33% for neutrophils, p < 0.001 for all time points). We conclude that after administration of glucocorticoids in CAP, patients had lower CRP levels and increased leukocyte and neutrophil count as compared to the placebo group. PCT levels were not different between treatment groups. PCT levels thus may more appropriately mirror the resolution of infection compared to more traditional inflammatory markers.

276209,Health informatics and EHR to support clinical research in the COVID-19 pandemic: an overview,2021,"Background: To investigate the acute effects of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on lifestyle and metabolic parameters in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 34 patients who were admitted to our hospital from April 16 to May 1, 2020. Data on stress levels, sleep duration, exercise, total diet, snacks, and prepared food intake were obtained from the questionnaires. Changes in the values of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body weight from 3 months before the administration of the questionnaire to the time the study questionnaire was administered (pandemic year), and those from 15 months before to 12 months before the administration of the questionnaire (pre-pandemic year) were evaluated. Results: Increased stress levels and decreased exercise volumes were observed in approximately 60% and 50% of participants during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Decreased sleep duration was associated with changes in the body weight for 3 months during pandemic year (r = - 0.40, p = 0.043). Furthermore, compared with changes in HbA1c for 3 months during pre-pandemic year, changes in HbA1c during the pandemic year were worse (0.12% [0.33] % during pandemic year vs. - 0.09 [0.39] % during pre-pandemic year, p = 0.027). Conclusions: Many patients experienced stress and exercised less due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Glycemic control in patients with T1D was worse than that in the previous year. Since the pandemic is currently ongoing, more attention should be paid to stress and lifestyle factor management in patients with T1D.

276803,Ocular-symptoms-related Google Search Trends during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Europe,2021,"Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an inherited error in the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) caused by a severe deficiency of the branched chain keto-acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) enzyme, which ultimately leads to neurological disorders. The limited therapies, including protein-restricted diets and liver transplants, are not as effective as they could be for the treatment of MSUD due to the current lack of molecular insights into the disease pathogenesis. To address this issue, we developed a Drosophila model of MSUD by knocking out the dDBT gene, an ortholog of the human dihydrolipoamide branched chain transacylase (DBT) subunit of BCKDH. The homozygous dDBT mutant larvae recapitulate an array of MSUD phenotypes, including aberrant BCAA accumulation, developmental defects, poor mobile behavior, and disrupted L-glutamate homeostasis. Moreover, the dDBT mutation causes neuronal apoptosis during the developmental progression of larval brains. The genetic and functional evidence generated by in vivo depletion of dDBT expression in the eye shows severe impairment of retinal rhadomeres. Further, the dDBT mutant shows elevated oxidative stress and higher lipid peroxidation accumulation in the larval brain. Therefore we conclude from in vivo evidence that the loss of dDBT results in oxidative brain damage that may led to neuronal cell death and contribute to aspects of MSUD pathology. Importantly, when the dDBT mutants were administrated with Metformin, the aberrances in BCAA levels and motor behavior were ameliorated. This intriguing outcome strongly merits the use of the dDBT mutant as a platform for developing MSUD therapies.","Tsai, Hui-Ying; Wu, Shih-Cheng; Li, Jian-Chiuan; Chen, Yu-Min; Chan, Chih-Chiang; Chen, Chun-Hong",Dis. model. mech.

Many argue such policies are discriminative and inconsistent with human rights law. Thus, this paper aims at analyzing the concept of human rights in the implementation of religion manifestation during the pandemic and investigating how states implement policies according to the international human rights legal framework. This normative research which uses comparative and conceptual approach concludes that policies established by states in general can be legitimized on several conditions, among others for public health concerns. In addition, the proportionality and the non-discrimination principles need to be applied accordingly.","Widhiyanti, Hanif Nur; Saraswati, Anak Agung Ayu Nanda; en,",Diponegoro Law Review,,636

In this study, we aimed to show that the surgical treatment of COVID-19 (-) colorectal cancer patients can be performed in a hospital which was declared as a pandemic hospital. METHOD: In our study, we included patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer in the general surgery clinic between the dates 03.20.2020 and 05.20.2020, when the hospital was declared COVID-19 pandemic hospital. Emergency colorectal cancer surgeries such as ileus and perforation were excluded from the study. RESULTS: While in the status of pandemic hospital, 80 COVID-19 (+) and 563 COVID-19 (+) suspicious patients were treated. Between 10 March 2020 and 15 May 2020, 12 colorectal cancer patients were operated in the General Surgery Clinic of BAIBU Faculty of Medicine, as well. CONCLUSION: We think that with our study we have shown that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the surgical treatment can be performed for patients with colorectal cancer by eliminating COVID-19 suspicions (Tab. 1, Ref. 14).","Catal, O; Ozer, B; Sit, M",Bratisl Lek Listy,,636

279471,Medical Robots for Infectious Diseases: Lessons and Challenges from the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-12-14,"PURPOSE: In the prediction of COVID-19 disease progression, a clear illustration and early determination of an area that will be affected by pneumonia remain great challenges. In this study, we aimed to predict and visualize the progression of lung lesions in COVID-19 patients in the early stage of illness by using chest CT. METHODS: COVID-19 patients who underwent three chest CT scans in the progressive phase were retrospectively enrolled. An extended CT ventilation imaging (CTVI) method was proposed in this work that was adapted to use two chest CT scans acquired on different days, and then lung ventilation maps were generated. The prediction maps were obtained according to the fractional ventilation values, which were related to pulmonary regional function and tissue property changes. The third CT scan was used to validate whether the prediction maps could be used to distinguish healthy regions and potential lesions. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients (mean age ± SD, 43 ± 10 years, 19 females, and 2-12 days between the second and third CT scans) were included in this study. The predicted lesion locations and sizes were almost the same as the true ones visualized in third CT scan. Quantitatively, the predicted lesion volumes and true lesion volumes showed both a good Pearson correlation (R2 = 0.80; P < 0.001) and good consistency in the Bland-Altman plot (mean bias = 0.04 cm3). Regarding the enlargements of the existing lesions, prediction results also exhibited a good Pearson correlation (R2 = 0.76; P < 0.001) with true lesion enlargements. CONCLUSION: The present findings demonstrated that the extended CTVI method could accurately predict and visualize the progression of lung lesions in COVID-19 patients in the early stage of illness, which is helpful for physicians to predetermine the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and make effective treatment plans in advance.","Wang, Cheng; Huang, Lu; Xiao, Sa; Li, Zimeng; Ye, Chaohui; Xia, Liming; Zhou, Xin",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,,636

In 2019, the Collaboration launched a standardised training programme developed by Wikimedia-trained committee members, academic dental school staff and the Cochrane Oral Health global community. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of this training programme in ensuring WCODS editors follow the processes underpinning Evidence-Based Dentistry (EBD). METHOD: A cohort of dental students and staff (n=136) from six dental schools in the UK and Malaysia took part in a standardised and structured training programme at the annual WCODS training meeting. Participants' abilities and their perceived levels of confidence in carrying out critical analysis of the literature were measured using pre- and post-training surveys, and competency assessments. RESULTS: Participants' skills in conducting literature searches, critical appraisal of the findings and creating and editing a Wikipedia page improved after training. CONCLUSION: The training programme provided participants with the skill set and confidence to apply best practice to create and edit Wikipedia entries.

280034,Alcohol- and Cigarette-Use Related Behaviors During Quarantine and Physical Distancing Amid COVID-19 in Indonesia,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The Lombardy region was among the areas most affected by COVID-19 infection worldwide; the Lombardy Emergency Medical System (EMS) responded immediately to this emergency. We analyzed several critical aspects to understand what occurred in that region. METHODS: This retrospective study compares the events managed by the dispatch center and the characteristics of the patients transported to the hospital -age, sex, SpO2, deaths- managed by the EMS in Brescia and Bergamo provinces between March-April 2020 and March-April 2019. Ambulances' waiting time at the hospitals before discharging patients and the patients' severity at emergency department admission were also analyzed. RESULTS: EMS managed 37,340 events in March-April 2020, +51.5% versus 2019. ""Breathing"" or ""Infective"" events reported to the dispatch center increased more than ten-fold (OR 25.1, p < 0.0001) in March 2020 and two-fold in April 2020 compared to 2019 (OR 3, p < 0.0001). Deaths increased +246% (OR 1.7, p < 0.0001), and patients not transported to hospital +481% (OR 2.9, p < 0.0001) in March 2020 compared to 2019. In some hospitals, ambulances waited more than one hour before discharging the patients, and the emergency departments doubled the admission of critically ill patients. Transported patients for ""Breathing"" or ""Infective"" events were primarily males (OR 1.5, p < 0.0001). The patients had lower SpO2 in 2020 than in 2019 and they were younger. CONCLUSIONS: The Lombardy region experienced an unexpected outbreak in an extremely short timeframe and in a limited area. The EMS coped with this pandemic, covering an extremely higher number of requests, with a ten-fold increase in the number of events managed.","Fagoni, Nazzareno; Perone, Giovanna; Villa, Guido Francesco; Celi, Simone; Bera, Paola; Sechi, Giuseppe Maria; Mare, Claudio; Zoli, Alberto; Botteri, Marco",Prehosp Emerg Care,,636

Molecular diagnosis of the disease is typically performed via nucleic acid-based detection of the virus from swabs, sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). However, the positive rate from the commonly used specimens (swabs or sputum) was less than 75%. Immunological assays for SARS-CoV-2 are needed to accurately diagnose COVID-19. Sera were collected from patients or healthy people in a local hospital in Xiangyang, Hubei Province, China. The SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibodies were then detected using a SARS-CoV-2 IgM colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay (GICA). Results were analysed in combination with sera collection date and clinical information. The GICA was found to be positive with the detected 82.2% (37/45) of RT-qPCR confirmed COVID-19 cases, as well as 32.0% (8/25) of clinically confirmed, RT-qPCR negative patients (4-14 days after symptom onset). Investigation of IgM-negative, RT-qPCR-positive COVID-19 patients showed that half of them developed severe disease. The GICA was found to be a useful test to complement existing PCR-based assays for confirmation of COVID-19, and a delayed specific IgM antibody response was observed among COVID-19 patients with severe progression.","Shen, Liang; Wang, Chunhua; Zhao, Jianzhong; Tang, Xiaoyong; Shen, Ying; Lu, Mingqing; Ding, Zhe; Huang, Canping; Zhang, Ji; Li, Shichao; Lan, Jiaming; Wong, Gary; Zhu, Yufang",Emerg Microbes Infect,,636

Governments have issued stay-at-home directives, and as a result, colleges and universities have been shut down across the world. Hence, online classes have become a key component in the continuity of education. The present study aimed to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on online education at the College of Medicine (COM) of Alfaisal University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Between March and April 2020, we emailed a survey to 1,289 students and faculty members of the COM. We obtained 208 responses (16.1%); 54.8% of the respondents were females, and 66.8% were medical students; 14.9% were master's students, and 18.3% were faculty. Among the respondents, 41.8% reported having little or no online teaching/learning experience before the pandemic, and 62.5% preferred blending online and face-to-face instruction. The reported challenges to online medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic included issues related to communication (59%), student assessment (57.5%), use of technology tools (56.5%), online experience (55%), pandemic-related anxiety or stress (48%), time management (35%), and technophobia (17%). Despite these challenges, most of the respondents (70.7%) believed that the COVID-19 pandemic has boosted their confidence in the effectiveness of online medical education. Consequently, 76% of participants intended to integrate the online expertise garnered during the pandemic into their practice.

We presented a 29-year-old male patient with COVID-19 who developed new-onset transient attention deficit and memory problems following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Structural neuroimaging was normal. MR-spectroscopy (MRS) of the bilateral DLPFC revealed significant for decreased levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), glutamate, and glutamate/glutamine ratio. After a follow-up without any medical treatment but with suggestions of memory exercises for three months a control MRS screening of DLPFC showed improved levels of NAA, glutamate, and glutamate/glutamine ratio. This report may suggest that cognitive deficits in SARS-CoV-2 infection can result from glutamatergic dysfunction with decreased NAA and glutamate levels in bilateral DLPFC.","Yesilkaya, Umit Haluk; Sen, Meltem; Balcioglu, Yasin Hasan",J Clin Neurosci,,636

services (hygiene practices and physical barriers) to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to patients et healthcare personnel Phone calls to patients planned to be admitted the following days should be organized to ensure these patien s do not present any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 Telemedicine or phone calls should replace office visits unless an ultrasound examination is scheduled for the pre-intervention evaluation If CT examination is necessary for the oncological evaluation, pulmonary lesions compatible with COVID-19 may be accidentally diagnosed Careful attention should be

Also, primary attention to RES has been given at the EU level with the new Green Deal and the new objectives of the Next Generation EU after the Covid pandemic, and at the level of national Governments worldwide. So far, there has not been an analysis of the RES convergence process across countries worldwide, given that the issue of climate change is a global externality. Previous analyses have focused on specific regions, such as EU, OECD, provinces of China. This paper fills this gap, providing new evidence on the convergence process of RES for the 176 countries that account for more than 98% of the world population, from 1990 to 2018. A common panel data set has been used to take into account countries' specific effects. Several socio-economics and political variables are introduced to test conditional convergence such as openness to trade, developments in financial markets, income distribution, level of education. The results of this new contribution reveal that there is evidence of sigma-absolute and conditional beta-convergence process for several groups of countries. Moreover, the conditional convergence analysis shows that spatial spillover effects exert rich and complex impact on convergence speed. Finally, we provide policy recommendations, highlighting that the decarbonization target in 2050 needs additional mobilization of public and private resources to pursue a common, convergence path worldwide.","Bigerna, Simona; Bollino, Carlo Andrea; Polinori, Paolo",J Environ Manage,,636

We tried to find some useful information by analyzing the covid-19 screening data, so as to provide help for clinical practice. METHOD: We collected nucleic acid and hematology data from 2510 patients for COVID-19 infection for retrospective analysis. RESULT: COVID-19 and influenza A and B infection rates were 1.3%, 3%, and 3%, respectively. COVID-19 nucleic acid was detected in stool but not in tear samples from 8 positive patients. Among the 32 patients with COVID-19, 15 (47%) and 16 (50%) patients showed decreased lymphocyte count and lymphocyte ratio, 21(66%) and 24(75%) patients showed decreased eosinophil count and eosinophil ratio, and 18 (56%) patients showed increased C-reactive protein. Ten hematological indicators significantly differed in the blood of patients with COVID-19 and those with influenza A and B (P < 0.05). Eighteen hematological indicators significantly differed between patients with COVID-19 and negative patients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The positive rate of influenza A and B infection was higher than that of COVID-19. When pharyngeal swab collection may cause infection, fecal samples can be examined. Evaluation of pharyngeal swab and fecal samples can improve the positive rate of nucleic acid detection. The COVID-19 can cause some hematological indices changes.","Yun, Hu; Sun, Zhuoran; Wu, Jun; Tang, Aiguo; Hu, Min; Xiang, Zhongyuan",Clin Chim Acta,,636

Situated in the global outbreak of COVID-19, our research aims at detecting semantic shifts in social media language triggered by the health crisis. With COVID-19 related big data extracted from Twitter, we train separate word embedding models for different time periods after the outbreak. We employ an alignment-based approach to compare these embeddings with a general-purpose Twitter embedding unrelated to COVID-19. We also compare our trained embeddings among them to observe diachronic evolution. Carrying out case studies on a set of words chosen by topic detection, we verify that our alignment approach is valid. Finally, we quantify the size of global semantic shift by a stability measure based on back-and-forth rotational alignment.","Guo, Yanzhu; Xypolopoulos, Christos; Vazirgiannis, Michalis",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.07836v1.pdf,636

284372,A Rapid Primary Healthcare Response to COVID-19: An Equity-Based and Systems-Thinking Approach to Care Ensuring that No One Is Left Behind,2020,"BACKGROUND: The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is a public health emergency and the case fatality rate in the United Kingdom is significant. Although there appear to be several early predictors of outcome, there are no currently validated prognostic models or scoring systems applicable specifically to patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: We aim to create a point-of-admission mortality risk scoring system using an artificial neural network (ANN). METHODS: We present an ANN that can provide a patient-specific, point-of-admission mortality risk prediction to inform clinical management decisions at the earliest opportunity. The ANN analyzes a set of patient features including demographics, comorbidities, smoking history, and presenting symptoms and predicts patient-specific mortality risk during the current hospital admission. The model was trained and validated on data extracted from 398 patients admitted to hospital with a positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Patient-specific mortality was predicted with 86.25% accuracy, with a sensitivity of 87.50% (95% CI 61.65%-98.45%) and specificity of 85.94% (95% CI 74.98%-93.36%). The positive predictive value was 60.87% (95% CI 45.23%-74.56%), and the negative predictive value was 96.49% (95% CI 88.23%-99.02%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 90.12%. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates an adaptive ANN trained on data at a single site, which demonstrates the early utility of deep learning approaches in a rapidly evolving pandemic with no established or validated prognostic scoring systems.","Abdulaal, Ahmed; Patel, Aatish; Charani, Esmita; Denny, Sarah; Mughal, Nabeela; Moore, Luke",J Med Internet Res,,636
285068,"A projection for psychiatry in the post-COVID-19 era: potential trends, challenges, and directions",2020,"The COVID-19 (Coronavirus 2019) pandemic has proven to be the biggest global shock since World War II. That war resulted in 5.5 million deaths. The number of COVID-19-infected persons exceeded 13 million in the first 6 months of the pandemic and many more asymptomatic cases are undocumented. The global economy has been affected severely. The tension, the fear, the drastic measures to try to control the spread of the disease disrupted everyone’s life from child to senior. The condition is worse in the global south, such as in Bangladesh, where the average population density is 7.5 times higher than that of China, where COVID-19 began and spread uncontrollably at the end of 2019. Lockdowns and social distancing were tried to stop the transmission of the disease but were often not observed faithfully or were less effective than thought to be. People need to trade and interact to earn money to survive but these activities could endanger others’ lives if they do not maintain safety measures. Individual awareness is not only curtailing the spread of COVID-19 but also saves others’ lives. This cross-sectional study used Ordinal and Binary logit models to predict the level of awareness through potential regressors of the citizen toward COVID-19 in Bangladesh. Findings of the study are that the level of awareness is dependent on the level of trauma;also, that household income is a statistically-significant predictor of awareness. Behavioral activities such as use of masks, outdoor activities, and stockpiling tendencies are found to be statistically significant predictors of awareness as well.","Hossain, Md Rifat Chakma Salit Tasnim Farah Zahra Zuairia",Heliyon,,636

Understanding of the immune response and biomarker analysis is needed to progress toward understanding disease pathology and developing improved treatment options. The goal of this study is to identify pathogenic factors that are linked to disease severity and patient characteristics. Patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized from March 17 to June 5, 2020 were analyzed for clinical features of disease and soluble plasma cytokines in association with disease severity and sex. Data from COVID-19 patients with acute illness were examined along with an age- and gender-matched control cohort. We identified a group of 16 soluble factors that were found to be increased in COVID-19 patients compared to controls, whereas 2 factors were decreased. In addition to inflammatory cytokines, we found significant increases in factors known to mediate vasculitis and vascular remodeling (PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB-BB, soluble CD40L (sCD40L), FGF, and IP10). Four factors such as platelet-derived growth factors, fibroblast growth factor-2, and IFN-Î³-inducible protein 10 were strongly associated with severe disease and ICU admission. Th2-related factors (IL-4 and IL-13) were increased with IL-4 and sCD40L present at increased levels in males compared with females. Our analysis revealed networking clusters of cytokines and growth factors, including previously unknown roles of vascular and stromal remodeling, activation of the innate immunity, as well activation of type 2 immune responses in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. These data highlight biomarker associations with disease severity and sex in COVID-19 patients.","Petrey, Aaron C; Qeadan, Fares; Middleton, Elizabeth A; Pinchuk, Irina V; Campbell, Robert A; Beswick, Ellen J",J. leukoc. biol,,636
285390,Staying ahead of the curve: Modified approach to emergency caesarean section under general anaesthesia in COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTIONWithin 2 months of first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Honduras, its government promoted nationwide implementation of multi-drug COVID-19 inpatient and outpatient treatment protocols. This was associated with a case fatality rate decrease from 9.33% to 2.97%. No decrease was seen in Mexico, a similar Latin American country that did not introduce multi-drug treatment protocols at that time. OBJECTIVEThe primary objective of the study was to use statistical process control to assess the likelihood that the decrease in case fatality rate in Honduras was due to chance, using Mexico as a control country. METHODSFourteen day running average COVID-19 case fatality rates in Honduras and Mexico were used to create Shewhart control charts during the first 6 months of the epidemic. The date of implementation in Honduras of the inpatient and outpatient multi-drug COVID-19 protocols were plotted on control charts, with a Mexican COVID-19 case fatality control chart for comparison. RESULTSThe case fatality rate for COVID-19 in Honduras dropped below the lower control limit 9 days after implementation of an inpatient and outpatient multi-drug therapeutic protocol, from an average 9.33% case fatality rate to 5.01%. The Honduran COVID-19 case fatality rate again dropped below the lower control limit to 2.97%, 17 days after launching a substantial government program to make the protocol medications accessible to underserved areas. Shewhart control chart plots of case fatality rates in Honduras suggest a plausible temporal association between the implementation dates of both the initial protocol implementation on May 3, 2020, and the outreach effort on June 10, 2020, and statistically significant control chart anomalies. No control chart anomalies were seen during that time in Mexico. CONCLUSIONDecreases in COVID-19 case fatality rates in Honduras were associated with both the initial publication a multi-drug COVID-19 therapeutic protocol and a subsequent outreach program.","Ontai, Sidney C; Pascua, Fernando Valerio; Zeng, Li; Hoffman, Miguel Sierra; VanBuren, Vincent; McCullough, Peter A",,,636
285561,Maintenance treatment for schizophrenia during the COVID-19 pandemic: the views of Japanese psychiatrists,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has stunted medical education activities, resulting in most conferences being cancelled or postponed. To continue professional education during this crisis, web-based conferences can be conducted via livestream and an audience interaction platform as an alternative. OBJECTIVE: The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has affected human connections worldwide. Conventional conferences have been replaced by web-based conferences. However, web-based conferencing has its challenges and limitations. This paper reports the logistics and preparations required for converting an international, on-site, multidisciplinary conference into a completely web-based conference within 3 weeks during the pandemic. METHODS: The program was revised, and a teleconference system, live recording system, director system setup, and broadcasting platform were arranged to conduct the web-based conference. RESULTS: We used YouTube (Alphabet Inc) and WeChat (Tencent Holdings Limited) for the web-based conference. Of the 24 hours of the conventional conference, 21.5 hours (90%) were retained in the web-based conference via live broadcasting. The conference was attended by 71% (37/52) of the original international faculties and 71% (27/38) of the overall faculties. In total, 61 out of 66 presentations (92%) were delivered. A special session-""Dialysis access management under the impact of viral epidemics""-was added to replace precongress workshops and competitions. The conference received 1810, 1452, and 1008 visits on YouTube and 6777, 4623, and 3100 visits on WeChat on conference days 1, 2, and 3, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Switching from a conventional on-site conference to a completely web-based format within a short period is a feasible method for maintaining professional education in a socially responsible manner during a pandemic.","Ko, Po-Jen; Yu, Sheng-Yueh; Chang, John Chien-Hwa; Hsieh, Ming-Ju; Chu, Sung-Yu; Tan, Jimmy Wei-Hwa; Cheng, Wan-Ling; Ho, Pei",JMIR Med Educ,,636

METHODS: A total of 203 healthcare workers of a pandemic centre of Istanbul, Turkey, were included in this retrospective study. According to the presence or absence of flu vaccination, participants were divided into group 1 and group 2. A comparison of the rate of COVID-19 was done between these two groups. Also, the mean age and the sex ratio of females/males were evaluated and compared between these two groups. RESULTS: Group 1 participants (n = 65) were older than participants in group 2 (n = 138) (p < 0.05). Despite of this, interestingly, the COVID-19 infection rate was lower in the 1st group (in comparison to the 2nd group) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study results showed that, even if low, the flu vaccination may have a protective effect on the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. Using this beneficial adjuvant effect of the vaccine may help us in this unpredictable battle with the COVID-19 pandemic.

286439,Smoking amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic - the invisible threat?,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to over 2.26 million deaths for almost 104 million confirmed cases worldwide, as of 4 February 2021 (WHO). Risk factors include pre-existing conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Although several vaccines have been deployed, there are few alternative anti-viral treatments available in the case of reduced or non-existent vaccine protection. Adopting a long-term holistic approach to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic appears critical with the emergence of novel and more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our objective was to identify comorbidity-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), potentially conferring increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection using a computational meta-analysis approach. SNP datasets were downloaded from a publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) catalog for 141 of 258 candidate COVID-19 comorbidities. Gene-level SNP analysis was performed to identify significant pathways by using the program MAGMA. An SNP annotation program was used to analyze MAGMA-identified genes. Differential gene expression was determined for significant genes across 30 general tissue types using the Functional and Annotation Mapping of GWAS online tool GENE2FUNC. COVID-19 comorbidities (n = 22) from six disease categories were found to have significant associated pathways, validated by Q-Q plots (p &lt; 0.05). Protein-protein interactions of significant (p &lt; 0.05) differentially expressed genes were visualized with the STRING program. Gene interaction networks were found to be relevant to SARS and influenza pathogenesis. In conclusion, we were able to identify the pathways potentially affected by or affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in underlying medical conditions likely to confer susceptibility and/or the severity of COVID-19. Our findings have implications in future COVID-19 experimental research and treatment development.","Beckman, M. F.; Mougeot, F. B.; Mougeot, J. C.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,636

Orthopedic literature review,2020,"BACKGROUND: The recent outbreak of Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) which has rapidly spread around the world in about three months with tens of thousands of deaths recorded so far is a global concern. An urgent need for potential therapeutic intervention is of necessity. Mpro is an attractive druggable target for the development of anti-COVID-19 drug development. Compounds previously characterized from Melissa officinalis were queried against main protease of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 using computational approach. RESULTS: Melitric acid A and salvanolic acid A had higher affinity than lopinavir and ivermectin using both AutodockVina and XP docking algorithms. The computational approach was employed in the generation of QSAR model using automated QSAR, and in the docking of ligands from Melissa officinalis with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. The best model obtained was KPLS_Radial_28 (R2 = 0.8548 and Q2=0.6474, and was used in predicting the bioactivity of the lead compounds. Molecular mechanics based MM-GBSA confirmed salvanolic acid A as the compound with the highest free energy and predicted bioactivity of 4.777; it interacted with His-41 of the catalytic dyad (Cys145-His41) of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), as this may hinder the cutting of inactive viral protein into active ones capable of replication. CONCLUSION: Salvanolic acid A can be further evaluated as potential Mpro inhibitor.","Elekofehinti, Olusola O; Iwaloye, Opeyemi; Famusiwa, Courage D; Akinseye, Olanrewaju; Rocha, Joao B T","Current drug discovery technologies, 1570-1638",,636

The gonads of both sexes are among the organs that may be affected by COVID-19 and/or may affect the severity of the disease. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection clearly differs between genders. The current evidence indicates that the underlying mechanism of such an interaction could be associated with genetic, hormonal, and immunological differences, as well as with gender differences in such habits as smoking and alcohol use. On the other hand, there are controversies as to how and to what extent the gonads could be affected by COVID-19, possibly impacting upon sex steroids, fertility, and other functions. This review underlines the possible mechanisms that could clarify these questions concerning COVID-19 and the gonads.

This change will be analyzed by looking at three trends in mathematics education: the use of digital technology, philosophy of mathematics education, and critical mathematics education. Digital technology became a trend in mathematics education in response to the arrival of a different kind of artifact to the mathematics classroom. It was thrust into the spotlight as the pandemic suddenly moved classrooms online around the world. Challenges specific to mathematics education in this context must be addressed. The link between the COVID-19 pandemic and digital technology in education also raises epistemological issues highlighted by philosophy of mathematics education and critical mathematics education. Using the notion that the basic unit of knowledge production throughout history is humans-with-media, I discuss how humans are connected to the virus, how it has laid bare social inequality, and how it will change the agendas of these three trends in mathematics education. I highlight the urgent need to study how mathematics education happens online for children when the home environment and inequalities in access to digital technologies assume such significant roles as classes move on-line. We need to understand the political role of agency of artifacts such as home in collectives of humans-with-media-things, and finally we need to learn how to implement curricula that address social inequalities.

Methods: Adverse events were prospectively evaluated using an electronic diary in 135 healthy adults who received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (AZD1222, AstraZeneca/Oxford, n = 42; or BNT162b2, Pfizer/BioNTech, n = 93). We semi-quantitatively measured anti-S1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline, 3 weeks after the first dose of AZD1222 or BNT162b2, and 2 weeks after the second dose of BNT162b2. We evaluated the association between the maximum grade of local or systemic adverse events and the anti-S1 IgG optical density using multivariate linear regression with adjustment for age, sex, and use of antipyretics. Results: The median age of the 135 vaccinees was 30 years (36 years in the AZD1222 group and 29 years in the BNT162b2 group) and 25.9% were male (9.5% in the AZD1222 group and 33.3% in the BNT162b2 group). Local and systemic adverse events were generally comparable after the first dose of AZD1222 and the second dose of BNT162b2. The grades of local and systemic adverse events were not significantly associated with anti-S1 IgG levels in the AZD1222 or BNT162b2 group.

Using the enantiomerically pure (R)- and (S)-forms of the ligand, depending on the organometallic moiety, either the SM,R or RM,S diastereomers, respectively, were observed in the molecular structures of the Ru- and Os(cym) (cym = Î·6-p-cymene) compounds, whereas the RM,R or SM,S diastereomers were found for the Rh- and Ir(Cp*) (Cp* = Î·5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) derivatives. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the energy difference between the diastereomers is very small, and therefore a mixture of both will be present in solution. The organometallics exhibited varying antiproliferative activity in a series of human cancer cell lines, with the complexes featuring the (R)-enantiomer of the ligand being more potent than the (S)-configured counterparts. Notably, the Rh and Ir complexes demonstrated high KSP inhibitory activity, even at 1 nM concentration, which was independent of the chirality of the ligand, whereas the Ru and especially the Os derivatives were much less active.","Lomzik, Michal; Hanif, Muhammad; Budniok, Aleksandra; Blauz, Andrzej; Makal, Anna; Tchon, Daniel M; Lesniewska, Barbara; Tong, Kelvin K H; Movassaghi, Sanam; Söhnel, Tilo; Jamieson, Stephen M F; Zafar, Ayesha; Reynisson, Jóhannes; Rychlik, Blazej; Hartinger, Christian G; Plazuk, Damian",Inorg Chem,,636
288381,Telehealth Beyond COVID-19,2020,"Recently, recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of three Ig isotypes (IgG, IgA, and IgM) sharing the same anti-spike protein Fab region were developed;we evaluated their neutralizing abilities using a pseudo-typed lentivirus coated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2-transfected Crandell–Rees feline kidney cells as the host cell line. Although each of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs was able to neutralize the spike-coated lentiviruses, IgM and IgA neutralized the viral particles at 225-fold and 125-fold lower concentrations, respectively, than that of IgG. Our finding that the neutralization ability of Igs with the same Fab domain was dramatically higher for IgM and IgA than IgG mAbs suggests a strategy for developing effective and affordable antibody therapies for COVID-19. The efficient neutralization conferred by IgM and IgA mAbs can be explained by their capacity to bind multiple virions. While several IgG mAbs have been approved as therapeutics by the FDA, there are currently no IgM or IgA mAbs available. We suggest that mAbs with multiple antigen-binding sites such as IgM and IgA could be developed as the new generation of therapy.","Pisil, Yalcin Yazici Zafer Shida Hisatoshi Miura Tomoyuki",Pathogens,,636

The assessment and management of these patients constitute a key element to stop dissemination. AIM: To describe the assessment and treatment of asymptomatic infection in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: We searched five databases and search engines for preprints/preproofs, up to August 22, 2020. We included cohort, cross-sectional, and case series studies, reporting the assessment and management of asymptomatic individuals. We extracted data on total discharges with negative PCR, length of hospitalization, treatment, and number of patients who remained asymptomatic. A random-effects model with inverse variance method was used to calculate the pooled prevalence. RESULTS: 41 studies (nine cross-sectional studies, five retrospective studies and 27 reports/case series; 647 asymptomatic individuals), were included, of which 47% were male (233/501). The age of patients was between 1month and 73 years. In patients who became symptomatic, length of hospitalization mean was 13.6 days (SD 6.4). Studies used lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine plus ritonavir/lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine with and without azithromycin, ribavirin plus interferon and interferon alfa. The proportion of individuals who remained asymptomatic was 91% (463/588 patients; 95%CI: 78.3%-98.7%); and asymptomatic individuals discharged with negative PCR was 86% (102/124 individuals; 95%CI: 58.4%-100%).

The wildlife rehabilitation centers (WRCs) play a relevant role in animal welfare; nevertheless, they also represent an imminent risk of pathogen transmission between humans-to-animals and between animals. Moreover, WRCs could spread pathogens into natural habitats through the reintroduction of infectious individuals. These biosafety concerns at WRCs may increase as the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 extends. We explored the current situation of Latin American WRCs under the COVID-19 pandemic to determine the feasibility of SARS-CoV-2 introduction, amplification, and spread within these institutions. We surveyed WRCs from eight Latin American countries. We found that pandemic is affecting these institutions in many aspects: workers with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, reduced economic resources, and lack of information and support from governmental authorities. These have forced WRCs to reduce the workforce, veterinary visits, and animal food rations and to increase the number of animals released. This scenario generates a risky environment for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially for felids, mustelids, and non-human primates. Therefore, it is imperative to respect quarantine periods, monitor incoming patients, increase biosecurity measures, develop and apply guidelines and recommendations for the protection of personnel and biosafety of enclosures and instruments. It is of utmost importance the proper and safer reintroduction of recovered wildlife.","Chaves, Andrea; Montecino-Latorre, Diego; Alcázar, Paloma; Suzán, Gerardo",Biotropica,,636

However, a global and detailed characterization of the changes that human circulating immune cells undergo with age is lacking. Here, we combined scRNA-seq, mass cytometry and scATAC-seq to compare immune cell types in peripheral blood collected from young and old subjects and patients with COVID-19. We found that the immune cell landscape was reprogrammed with age and was characterized by T cell polarization from naive and memory cells to effector, cytotoxic, exhausted and regulatory cells, along with increased late natural killer cells, age-associated B cells, inflammatory monocytes and age-associated dendritic cells. In addition, the expression of genes, which were implicated in coronavirus susceptibility, was upregulated in a cell subtype-specific manner with age. Notably, COVID-19 promoted age-induced immune cell polarization and gene expression related to inflammation and cellular senescence. Therefore, these findings suggest that a dysregulated immune system and increased gene expression associated with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility may at least partially account for COVID-19 vulnerability in the elderly.","Zheng, Yingfeng; Liu, Xiuxing; Le, Wenqing; Xie, Lihui; Li, He; Wen, Wen; Wang, Si; Ma, Shuai; Huang, Zhaohao; Ye, Jinguo; Shi, Wen; Ye, Yanxia; Liu, Zunpeng; Song, Moshi; Zhang, Weiqi; Han, Jing-Dong J; Belmonte, Juan Carlos Izpisua; Xiao, Chuanle; Qu, Jing; Wang, Hongyang; Liu, Guang-Hui; Su, Wenru",Protein Cell,,636

The purpose of this research was to assess the risk of COVID-19 epidemic dissemination in Japan by estimating the current state of epidemic dissemination and providing some epidemic prevention and control recommendations. Firstly, the period from 6 January to 31 March 2020 was divided into four stages and the relevant parameters were estimated according to the imported cases in Japan. The basic reproduction number of the current stage is 1.954 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.851-2.025), which means COVID-19 will spread quickly, and the self-healing rate of Japanese is about 0.495 (95% CI 0.437-0.506), with small variations in the four stages. Secondly, the results were applied to the actual reported cases from 1 to 5 April 2020, verifying the reliability of the estimated data using the accumulated reported cases located within the 95% confidence interval and the relative error of forecast data of five days being less than 2 . 5 % . Thirdly, considering the medical resources in Japan, the times the epidemic beds and ventilators become fully occupied are predicted as 5 and 15 May 2020, respectively. Keeping with the current situation, the final death toll in Japan may reach into the millions. Finally, based on experience with COVID-19 prevention and control in China, robust measures such as nationwide shutdown, store closures, citizens isolating themselves at home, and increasing PCR testing would quickly and effectively prevent COVID-19 spread.","Chen, Zhongxiang; Yang, Jun; Dai, Binxiang",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,636

Data on vaccine safety and immunogenicity in these populations are therefore limited. Objective: To evaluate the immunogenicity of COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines in pregnant and lactating women, including against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Design, Setting, and Participants: An exploratory, descriptive, prospective cohort study enrolled 103 women who received a COVID-19 vaccine from December 2020 through March 2021 and 28 women who had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from April 2020 through March 2021 (the last follow-up date was March 26, 2021). This study enrolled 30 pregnant, 16 lactating, and 57 neither pregnant nor lactating women who received either the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) or BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccines and 22 pregnant and 6 nonpregnant unvaccinated women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain binding, neutralizing, and functional nonneutralizing antibody responses from pregnant, lactating, and nonpregnant women were assessed following vaccination. Spike-specific T-cell responses were evaluated using IFN-Î³ enzyme-linked immunospot and multiparameter intracellular cytokine-staining assays. Humoral and cellular immune responses were determined against the original SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain as well as against the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. Results: This study enrolled 103 women aged 18 to 45 years (66% non-Hispanic White) who received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. After the second vaccine dose, fever was reported in 4 pregnant women (14%; SD, 6%), 7 lactating women (44%; SD, 12%), and 27 nonpregnant women (52%; SD, 7%). Binding, neutralizing, and functional nonneutralizing antibody responses as well as CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses were present in pregnant, lactating, and nonpregnant women following vaccination. Binding and neutralizing antibodies were also observed in infant cord blood and breast milk. Binding and neutralizing antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern were reduced, but T-cell responses were preserved against viral variants. Conclusion and Relevance: In this exploratory analysis of a convenience sample, receipt of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was immunogenic in pregnant women, and vaccine-elicited antibodies were transported to infant cord blood and breast milk. Pregnant and nonpregnant women who were vaccinated developed cross-reactive antibody responses and T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.","Collier, Ai-Ris Y; McMahan, Katherine; Yu, Jingyou; Tostanoski, Lisa H; Aguayo, Ricardo; Ansel, Jessica; Chandrashekar, Abishek; Patel, Shivani; Apraku Bondzie, Esther; Sellers, Daniel; Barrett, Julia; Sanborn, Owen; Wan, Huahua; Chang, Aiquan; Anioke, Tochi; Nkolola, Joseph; Bradshaw, Connor; Jacob-Dolan, Catherine; Feldman, Jared; Gebre, Makda; Borducchi, Erica N; Liu, Jinyan; Schmidt, Aaron G; Suscovich, Todd; Linde, Caitlyn; Alter, Galit; Hacker, Michele R; Barouch, Dan H",JAMA,,636

Methodology: Using a combined qualitative-quantitative approach, Q-method, we tried to assess people's discernment from different perspectives. This was done through a questionnaire survey method during the national-level lockdown 1.0 in India. Results: We have differentiated the perceptions of youth respondents into seven factors, including six subdimensions, on COVID-19 pandemic (viz., science, society, environment, economy, politics, and religion). The choices and opinions have been segregated into two major groups: quantitative and qualitative. Conclusion: This work yielded a firsthand ground-level insight into the comprehensive yet diverse responses from youths regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in India. There are various topics that arise from this study, for example, misinformation, misinterpretation of science, dubious nature of faith in governance and policy, turbid understanding of strategy, polarization of opinion, and so forth.

In this study, we incorporate social network theories and analyses to investigate how emotions shape online content diffusion, using a computational approach. We rigorously quantify and characterize the structural properties of diffusion cascades, in which more than six million unique individuals transmitted 387,486 articles in a massive-scale online social network, WeChat. We detected the degree of eight discrete emotions (i.e., surprise, joy, anticipation, love, anxiety, sadness, anger, and disgust) embedded in these articles, using a newly generated domain-specific and up-to-date emotion lexicon. We found that articles with a higher degree of anxiety and love reached a larger number of individuals and diffused more deeply, broadly, and virally, whereas sadness had the opposite effect. Age and network degree of the individuals who transmitted an article and, in particular, the social ties between senders and receivers, significantly mediated how emotions affect article diffusion. These findings offer valuable insight into how emotions facilitate or hinder information spread through social networks and how people receive and transmit online content that induces various emotions.","Yu, Yifan; Huang, Shan; Liu, Yuchen; Tan, Yong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.09003v1.pdf,636

The present study aimed at testing the efficacy of CHM on digestive symptoms and liver function (primary outcomes), the aggravation of COVID-19, and the time to viral assay conversion (secondary outcomes), among patients with COVID-19, compared with standard pharmacotherapy. The literature search was undertaken in 11 electronic databases from December 1, 2019 up to November 8, 2020. Appraisal of the evidence was conducted with Cochrane risk of bias tool or Newcastle Ottawa Scale. A random-effects model or subgroup analysis was conducted when significant heterogeneity was identified in the meta-analysis. The certainty of the evidence was assessed with the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation approach. Forty-eight included trials involving 4,704 participants were included. Meta-analyses favored CHM plus standard pharmacotherapy for COVID-19 on reducing the aggravation of COVID-19 and the time to viral assay conversion compared with standard pharmacotherapy. However, the present CHM as a complementary therapy for treating COVID-19 may not be beneficial for improving most gastrointestinal symptoms and liver function based on the current evidence.

As we write, infection rates are at their highest point globally and are rising extremely rapidly in some areas due to more infectious variants. The primary target of SARS-CoV-2 is the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Recent sequence analyses of the ACE2 gene predict that many nonhuman primates are also likely to be highly susceptible to infection. However, the anticipated risk is not equal across the Order. Furthermore, some taxonomic groups show high ACE2 amino acid conservation, while others exhibit high variability at this locus. As an example of the latter, analyses of strepsirrhine primate ACE2 sequences to date indicate large variation among lemurs and lorises compared to other primate clades despite low sampling effort. Here, we report ACE2 gene and protein sequences for 71 individual strepsirrhines, spanning 51 species and 19 genera. Our study reinforces previous results while finding additional variability in other strepsirrhine species, and suggests several clades of lemurs have high potential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Troublingly, some species, including the rare and endangered aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), as well as those in the genera Avahi and Propithecus, may be at high risk. Given that lemurs are endemic to Madagascar and among the primates at highest risk of extinction globally, further understanding of the potential threat of COVID-19 to their health should be a conservation priority. All feasible actions should be taken to limit their exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","Melin, Amanda D; Orkin, Joseph D; Janiak, Mareike C; Valenzuela, Alejandro; Kuderna, Lukas; Marrone, Frank; Ramangason, Hasinala; Horvath, Julie E; Roos, Christian; Kitchener, Andrew C; Khor, Chiea Chuen; Lim, Weng Khong; Lee, Jessica G H; Tan, Patrick; Umapathy, Govindhaswamy; Raveendran, Muthuswamy; Alan Harris, R; Gut, Ivo; Gut, Marta; Lizano, Esther; Nadler, Tilo; Zinner, Dietmar; Le, Minh D; Manu, Sivakumara; Rabarivola, Clément J; Zaramody, Alphonse; Andriaholinirina, Nicole; Johnson, Steig E; Jarvis, Erich D; Fedrigo, Olivier; Wu, Dongdong; Zhang, Guojie; Farh, Kyle Kai-How; Rogers, Jeffrey; Marques-Bonet, Tomas; Navarro, Arcadi; Juan, David; Arora, Paramjit S; Higham, James P",Am J Primatol,,636

In an early U.S. epicenter of the outbreak, we designed and implemented a system to expedite this testing and the results here from the first 3 weeks. The process included a Laboratory Medicine designee for communication with organ recovery and transplant clinical staff, specialized sample labeling and handoff, and priority processing. Thirty-two organs recovered from 14 of 17 screened donors were transplanted vs 70 recovered from 23 donors during the same period in 2019. No pretransplant or organ donors tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Median turnaround time from specimen receipt was 6.8 hours (donors), 6.5 hours (recipients): 4.5 hours faster than daily inpatient median. No organ recoveries or transplantations were disrupted by a lack of SARS-CoV-2 testing. Waitlist inactivations for COVID-19 precautions were reduced in our region. Systems that include specialized ordering pathways and adequate testing capacity can support continued organ transplantation, even in a SARS-CoV-2 hyperendemic area.","Lieberman, Joshua A; Mays, James A; Wells, Candy; Cent, Anne; Bell, Deborah; Bankson, Daniel D; Greninger, Alexander L; Jerome, Keith R; Limaye, Ajit P",Am. j. transplant,,636

We proposed label-free Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with deep learning (DL) and non-negative least squares (NNLS) as a solution to overcome the drug fast screening bottleneck, which is not only a great challenge to drug administration, but also a major scientific challenge linked to falsified and/or substandard medicines. The result showed that Raman spectroscopy remains a cost effective, rapid, and user-friendly method, which if combined with DL and NNLS leads to fast implantation in the identification of lactose dominated drug (LDD) formulations. Meanwhile, Raman spectroscopy with the peak matching method allows a visual interpretation of the spectral signature (presence or absence of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and low content APIs).","Fu, Xiang; Zhong, Li-Min; Cao, Yong-Bing; Chen, Hui; Lu, Feng",,,636

295770,Procedural justice and egalitarian principles for rationing decisions in the COVID-19 crisis,2020,"Facing a growing and more affluent world population, changing climate and finite natural resources, world food systems will have to change in the future. The aim of the Agrimonde-Terra foresight study was to build global scenarios linking land use and food security, with special attention paid to overlooked aspects such as nutrition and health, in order to help explore the possible future of the global food system. In this article, we seek to highlight how the resulting set of scenarios contributes to the debate on land use and food security and enlarges the range of possible futures for the global food system. We highlight four main contributions. Combining a scenario building method based on morphological analysis and quantitative simulations with a tractable and simple biomass balance model, the proposed approach improves transparency and coherence between scenario narratives and quantitative assessment. Agrimonde-Terra's scenarios comprise a wide range of alternative diets, with contrasting underlying nutritional and health issues, which accompany contrasting urbanization and rural transformation processes, both dimensions that are lacking in other sets of global scenarios. Agrimonde-Terra's scenarios share some similarities with existing sets of global scenarios, notably the SSPs, but are usually less optimistic regarding agricultural land expansion up to 2050. Results suggest that changing global diets toward healthier patterns could also help to limit the expansion in agricultural land area. Agrimonde-Terra's scenarios enlarge the scope of possible futures by proposing two pathways that are uncommon in other sets of global scenarios. The first proposes to explore possible reconnection of the food industry and regional production within supranational regional blocs. The second means that we should consider that a 'perfect storm', induced by climate change and an ecological crisis combined with social and economic crises, is still possible. Both scenarios should be part of the debate as the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic shows.","Mora, Olivier; Le Mouël, Chantal; de Lattre-Gasquet, Marie; Donnars, Catherine; Dumas, Patrice; Réchauchère, Olivier; Brunelle, Thierry; Manceron, Stéphane; Marajo-Petitzon, Elodie; Moreau, Clémence; Barzman, Marc; Forslund, Agneta; Marty, Pauline",PLoS One,,636

The sample of the study consists of 402 elderly people. The relationships of all factors and the scores of QoL were analyzed with Pearson correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression analysis. The average value of QoL was found to be 3.56. It was observed that communication with physicians during the restriction process could positively affect the perception of quality of life. Elderly adults who reported using the Internet reported better QoL levels. Significant relationships were found between educational status, marital status, health insurance and chronic illness status, and QoL. Our sample shows that the epidemic does not negatively affect the perception of quality of life in the short term. Personal characteristics of elderly adults and their communications with the physician appear to have a protective effect on QoL during the epidemic.

297993,Getting Ready for COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected health and lifestyle behaviors of people globally. This project aims to identify the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle behavior of individuals in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region during confinement. METHODS: We conducted an online survey in 17 countries (Egypt, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Yemen, Syria, Palestine, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, Iraq, and Sudan) from the MENA region on August and September 2020. The questionnaire included self-reported information on lifestyle behaviors, including physical activity, eating habits, smoking, watching television, social media use and sleep before and during the pandemic. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle behaviors. RESULTS: A total of 5896 participants were included in the final analysis and 62.8% were females. The BMI of the participants was 25.4 ± 5.8 kg/m2. Around 38.4% of the participants stopped practicing any physical activities during the confinement (P < 0.001), and 57.1% reported spending more than 2 h on social media (P < 0.001). There were no significant changes in smoking habits. Also, 30.9% reported an improvement in their eating habits compared with 24.8% reported worsening of their eating habits. Fast-food consumption decreased significantly in 48.8% of the study population. This direct/indirect exposure to COVID-19 was associated with an increased consumption of carbohydrates (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.02-1.17; P = 0.01), egg (OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.02-1.16; P = 0.01), sugar (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.02-1.16; P = 0.02), meat, and poultry (OR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.06-1.20; P < 0.01). There was also associated increase in hours spent on watching television (OR = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.02-1.12; P < 0.01) and social media (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.01-1.18; P = 0.03). However, our results showed a reduction in sleeping hours among those exposed to COVID-19 infection (OR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.77-0.94; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increase in food consumption and sedentary life. Being exposed to COVID-19 by direct infection or through an infected household is a significant predictor of amplifying these changes. Public health interventions are needed to address healthy lifestyle behaviors during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Abouzid, Mohamed; El-Sherif, Dina M; Eltewacy, Nael Kamel; Dahman, Nesrine Ben Hadj; Okasha, Salah A; Ghozy, Sherief; Islam, Sheikh Mohammed Shariful",J Transl Med,,636

298479,Covid-19 pandemic and bats: a lucky symbol of evil fortune,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present enormous challenges for colleges and universities and strategies for save reopening remain a topic of ongoing debate. Many institutions that reopened cautiously in the fall experienced a massive wave of infections and colleges were soon declared as the new hotspots of the pandemic. However, the precise effects of college outbreaks on their immediate neighborhood remain largely unknown. Here we show that the first two weeks of instruction present a high-risk period for campus outbreaks and that these outbreaks tend to spread into the neighboring communities. By integrating a classical mathematical epidemiology model and Bayesian learning, we learned the dynamic reproduction number for 30 colleges from their daily case reports. Of these 30 institutions, 14 displayed a spike of infections within the first two weeks of class, with peak seven-day incidences well above 1,000 per 100,000, an order of magnitude larger than the nation-wide peaks of 70 and 150 during the first and second waves of the pandemic. While most colleges were able to rapidly reduce the number of new infections, many failed to control the spread of the virus beyond their own campus: Within only two weeks, 17 campus outbreaks translated directly into peaks of infection within their home counties. These findings suggests that college campuses are at risk to develop an extreme incidence of COVID-19 and become superspreaders for neighboring communities. We anticipate that tight test-trace-quarantine strategies, flexible transition to online instruction, and-most importantly-compliance with local regulations will be critical to ensure a safe campus reopening after the winter break.","Lu, Hannah; Weintz, Cortney; Pace, Joseph; Indana, Dhiraj; Linka, Kevin; Kuhl, Ellen",Comput Methods Biomech Biomed Engin,,636

There is a growing body of evidence, obtained from clinical trials and case reports, demonstrating clinical and paraclinical improvement in patients following administration of baricitinib including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata, interferon-mediated auto-inflammatory diseases, graft versus host disease, diabetic kidney disease, and recently, coronavirus disease-19. However, despite overall encouraging results, many adverse effects have been observed in baricitinib-treated patients ranging from simple infections to increased risk of malignancies, particularly in long-term use. The significant efficacy of baricitinib on one hand and the probable adverse effects, on the other hand, urge for further investigations before establishing it as a part of standard therapeutic protocols. Herein, we have provided a review of the studies which have used baricitinib for treating various inflammatory disorders and summarized the advantages and disadvantages of its administration.

301568,"COVID-19, youth, and the engineered social movements in Iran",2021,"INTRODUCTION: At the end of 2019, the COVID-19 broke out, and spread to Guizhou province in January of 2020. METHODOLOGY: To acquire the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 in Guizhou province, we collected data from 169 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 related cases. We described the demographic characteristics of the cases and estimated the incubation period, serial interval and the effective reproduction number. We also presented two representative case studies in Guizhou province: Case Study 1 was an example of the asymptomatic carrier; while Case Study 2 was an example of a large and complex infection chain that involved four different regions, spanning three provinces and eight families. RESULTS: Two peaks in the incidence distribution associated with COVID-19 in Guizhou province were related to the 6.04 days (95% CI: 5.00 - 7.10) of incubation period and 6.14±2.21 days of serial interval. We also discussed the effectiveness of the control measures based on the instantaneous effective reproduction number that was a constantly declining curve. CONCLUSIONS: As of February 2, 2020, the estimated effective reproduction number was below 1, and no new cases were reported since February 26. These showed that Guizhou Province had achieved significant progress in preventing the spread of the epidemic. The medical isolation of close contacts was consequential. Meanwhile, the asymptomatic carriers and the super-spreaders must be isolated in time, who would cause a widespread infection.","Ping, Kaike; Lei, Mingyu; Gou, Yun; Tao, Zhongfa; Yao, Guanghai; Hu, Can; Tao, Qin; Zou, Zhiting; Wang, Dingming; Li, Shijun; Huang, Yan",J Infect Dev Ctries,,636

302413,Covid-19: Japan's success despite inept bureaucracy and incompetence,2020,"The adaptive immunity that protects patients from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is not well characterized. In particular, the asymptomatic patients have been found to induce weak and transient SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown; meanwhile, the protective immunity that guide the recovery of these asymptomatic patients is elusive. Here, we characterized SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in 10 asymptomatic patients and 64 patients with other disease severity (mild, n = 10, moderate, n = 32, severe, n = 12) and found that asymptomatic or mild symptomatic patients failed to mount virus-specific germinal center (GC) B cell responses that result in robust and prolonged humoral immunity, assessed by GC response indicators including follicular helper T (TFH) cell and memory B cell responses as well as serum CXCL13 levels. Alternatively, these patients mounted potent virus-specific TH1 and CD8+ T cell responses. In sharp contrast, patients of moderate or severe disease induced vigorous virus-specific GC B cell responses and associated TFH responses; however, the virus-specific TH1 and CD8+ T cells were minimally induced in these patients. These results, therefore, uncovered the protective immunity in asymptomatic patients and also revealed the strikingly dichotomous and incomplete humoral and cellular immune responses in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity, providing important insights into rational design of effective COVID-19 vaccines.","Gao, Leiqiong; Zhou, Jing; Yang, Sen; Wang, Lisha; Chen, Xiangyu; Yang, Yang; Li, Ren; Pan, Zhiwei; Zhao, Jing; Li, Zhirong; Huang, Qizhao; Tang, Jianfang; Hu, Li; Liu, Pinghuang; Zhang, Guozhong; Chen, Yaokai; Ye, Lilin",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,636

Based on the population mobility metrics derived from mobile phone geolocation data across 135 countries or territories during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, we built a metapopulation epidemiological model to measure the effect of travel and contact restrictions on containing COVID-19 outbreaks across regions. We found that if these interventions had not been deployed, the cumulative number of cases could have shown a 97-fold (interquartile range 79-116) increase, as of May 31, 2020. However, their effectiveness depended upon the timing, duration, and intensity of the interventions, with variations in case severity seen across populations, regions, and seasons. Additionally, before effective vaccines are widely available and herd immunity is achieved, our results emphasize that a certain degree of physical distancing at the relaxation of the intervention stage will likely be needed to avoid rapid resurgences and subsequent lockdowns.","Lai, Shengjie; Ruktanonchai, Nick W; Carioli, Alessandra; Ruktanonchai, Corrine W; Floyd, Jessica R; Prosper, Olivia; Zhang, Chi; Du, Xiangjun; Yang, Weizhong; Tatem, Andrew J",,,636

(Special Issue: COVID-19: conventional therapies, fates, and mechanisms.)",2020,"BACKGROUND: Patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) engages patients as partners in research and focuses on questions and outcomes that are important to patients. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced PCOR teams to engage through web-based platforms rather than in person. Similarly, virtual engagement is the only safe alternative for members of the cystic fibrosis (CF) community, who spend their lives following strict infection control guidelines and are already restricted from in-person interactions. In the absence of universal best practices, the CF community has developed its own guidelines to help PCOR teams engage through web-based platforms. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the important attributes, facilitators, and barriers to teams when selecting web-based platforms. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with CF community members, nonprofit stakeholders, and researchers to obtain information regarding their experience with using web-based platforms, including the effectiveness and efficiency of these platforms and their satisfaction with and confidence while using each platform. Interviews conducted via Zoom were audio recorded and transcribed. We identified key themes through content analysis with an iterative, inductive, and deductive coding process. RESULTS: In total, 15 participants reported using web-based platforms for meetings, project management, document sharing, scheduling, and communication. When selecting web-based platforms, participants valued their accessibility, ease of use, and integration with other platforms. Participants speculated that successful web-based collaboration involved platforms that emulate in-person interactions, recognized the digital literacy levels of the team members, intentionally aligned platforms with collaboration goals, and achieved team member buy-in to adopt new platforms. CONCLUSIONS: Successful web-based engagement in PCOR requires the use of multiple platforms in order to fully meet the asynchronous or synchronous goals of the project. This study identified the key attributes for the successful practice of PCOR on web-based platforms and the common challenges and solutions associated with their use. Our findings provide the best practices for selecting platforms and the lessons learned through web-based PCOR collaborations.","Thayer, Erin K; Pam, Molly; Al Achkar, Morhaf; Mentch, Laura; Brown, Georgia; Kazmerski, Traci M; Godfrey, Emily",J Particip Med,,636
303690,The COVID-19 Pandemic and the $16 Trillion Virus,2020,"Objectives: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been affecting many people on earth and our society. Japan is known to have relatively smaller number of its infections as well as deaths among developed nations. However, accurate prevalence of COVID-19 in Japan remains unknown. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibody using 1000 samples from patients at outpatient settings who visited the clinic from March 31 to April 7, 2020, stratified by the decade of age and sex. Results: There were 33 positive IgG among 1000 serum samples (3.3%, 95%CI: 2.3-4.6%). By applying this figure to the census of Kobe City (population: 1,518,870), it is estimated that the number of people with positive IgG be 50,123 (95%CI: 34,934-69,868). Age and sex adjusted prevalence of positivity was calculated 2.7% (95%CI: 1.8-3.9%), and the estimated number of people with positive IgG was 40,999 (95%CI: 27,333-59,221). These numbers were 396 to 858-fold more than confirmed cases with PCR testing in Kobe City. Conclusions: Our cross-sectional serological study suggests that the number of people with seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kobe, Japan is far more than the confirmed cases by PCR testing.","Doi, Asako; Iwata, Kentaro; Kuroda, Hirokazu; Hasuike, Toshikazu; Nasu, Seiko; Kanda, Aya; Nagao, Tomomi; Nishioka, Hiroaki; Tomii, Keisuke; Morimoto, Takeshi; Kihara, Yasuki",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,,636

303867,Guide to safe medical practice in outpatient settings during COVID-19 pandemic. (Special Issue: COVID-19.),2020,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 related home confinement on the paediatric population by focusing on anxiety, behavioural disturbances and somatic symptoms. BACKGROUND: To limit the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, governments have imposed nationwide lockdowns to prevent direct contact; this has affected everyday lives and activities such as attending school classes. Such isolation may have impacted children's anxiety levels. DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study using a web-based anonymous questionnaire from 22-26 April, 2020, among children (N = 2,292) in Spain. For children below 7 years of age, parents reported the children's behavioural, emotional and somatic symptoms and family environment data on a questionnaire designed by the researchers. Children over 7 years answered the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale either independently or with their parents' assistance. RESULTS: Children over 7 years, boys in particular, scored high on the anxiety spectrum. Moreover, participants who knew someone who had suffered from COVID-19 at home or whose parent was directly involved in the pandemic, obtained higher Total Anxiety scores. Significantly high values were found in all aspects of anxiety among those who feared infection or whose parents been unemployed. Of the children below 7 years, 56.3% had four or more anxiety-related symptoms, the most frequent of which were tantrums, emotional changes, restlessness and fear of being alone. The number of symptoms reported was significant when someone in the family home had been infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 home confinement had a significant impact on children, causing anxiety, behavioural problems and somatic manifestations. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses play a key role in screening children who have experience confinement owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to detect early anxiety symptoms using tele-health. Suitable direct interventions can then be implemented or interdisciplinary manage could be started.","Garcia-Adasme, Salvador I; Cárdenas-Rebollo, José M; Jimenez-Perianes, Ana; Lalinde, Margarita; Jimeno, Sara; Ventura, Paula S; Díaz, Alvaro; López-Escobar, Alejandro",J. clin. nurs,,636

305147,Global Collaboration in Times of COVID-19: Cuba's Emergency Medical Contingent,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) and Public Health England (PHE) have successfully worked together on the surveillance of influenza and other infectious diseases for over 50 years, including three previous pandemics. With the emergence of the international outbreak of the coronavirus infection (COVID-19), a UK national approach to containment has been established to test people suspected of exposure to COVID-19. At the same time and separately, the RCGP RSC's surveillance has been extended to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the community as well as assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study are to surveil COVID-19 in both asymptomatic populations and ambulatory cases with respiratory infections, ascertain both the rate and pattern of COVID-19 spread, and assess the effectiveness of the containment policy. METHODS: The RCGP RSC, a network of over 500 general practices in England, extract pseudonymized data weekly. This extended surveillance comprises of five components: (1) Recording in medical records of anyone suspected to have or who has been exposed to COVID-19. Computerized medical records suppliers have within a week of request created new codes to support this. (2) Extension of current virological surveillance and testing people with influenza-like illness or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)-with the caveat that people suspected to have or who have been exposed to COVID-19 should be referred to the national containment pathway and not seen in primary care. (3) Serology sample collection across all age groups. This will be an extra blood sample taken from people who are attending their general practice for a scheduled blood test. The 100 general practices currently undertaking annual influenza virology surveillance will be involved in the extended virological and serological surveillance. (4) Collecting convalescent serum samples. (5) Data curation. We have the opportunity to escalate the data extraction to twice weekly if needed. Swabs and sera will be analyzed in PHE reference laboratories. RESULTS: General practice clinical system providers have introduced an emergency new set of clinical codes to support COVID-19 surveillance. Additionally, practices participating in current virology surveillance are now taking samples for COVID-19 surveillance from low-risk patients presenting with LRTIs. Within the first 2 weeks of setup of this surveillance, we have identified 3 cases: 1 through the new coding system, the other 2 through the extended virology sampling. CONCLUSIONS: We have rapidly converted the established national RCGP RSC influenza surveillance system into one that can test the effectiveness of the COVID-19 containment policy. The extended surveillance has already seen the use of new codes with 3 cases reported. Rapid sharing of this protocol should enable scientific critique and shared learning.

Since prevention and social isolation are known to be the only ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19, this has created challenges among the lower-middle income countries (LMIC) including Pakistan, as it battles between an under-resourced healthcare, an economic shutdown, and widespread myths and misconceptions. Therefore, a study was conducted to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and perceptions regarding COVID-19 as public understanding is vital to help facilitate the control of this outbreak. METHODS: A pre-validated online questionnaire was distributed among the general population of Pakistan from 1st to 12th June 2020. Descriptive statistics were analyzed using SPSS v25. Adequate knowledge was assigned as a score of > 4 (range: 0-8) and good perception as a score of > 3 (range: 0-5). Chi-square test was used to determine the significance of difference in knowledge and perception of COVID-19 with socio-demographic characteristics. Logistic regression analysis was run to identify factors associated with adequate knowledge and perception. P < 0.05 was considered as significant. RESULTS: A total of 1200 respondents participated in this study with a wide range of age groups and education. Majority of the respondents had adequate knowledge (93.3%) with a mean score of 6.59 ± 1.35, and good perception (85.6%) with a mean score of 4.29 ± 0.82. Significant differences in knowledge and perception were observed among genders, age groups, education and between students and employees in the healthcare and non-healthcare department. A multivariate analysis revealed a higher educational status and female gender to be significant predictors of adequate knowledge and perception. CONCLUSIONS: Albeit the surge of COVID-19 cases in Pakistan, the participants demonstrated an overall adequate knowledge and good perception towards COVID-19. There is a need to follow the preventive protocols and dissemination of correct information through conducting educational interventions that target safe health practices and provide appropriate information on this infection.","Ladiwala, Zoya Fatima Rizwan; Dhillon, Rubaid Azhar; Zahid, Ibrahim; Irfan, Omar; Khan, Muhammad Sharjeel; Awan, Safia; Khan, Javaid Ahmad",BMC Public Health,,636

306901,The potential impact of vulnerability and coping capacity on the pandemic control of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Continuing medical education and continuing professional development have been affected by the ongoing 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Therefore, we developed the 2020 International Web-Based Neurosurgery Congress (2020 IWBNC), which became the first successful virtual neurosurgical congress. The aim of this article was to describe the experience designing and organizing a web congress by the 2020 IWBNC method. METHODS: The 2020 IWBNC was organized by the Center for Research and Training in Neurosurgery (Centro de Investigación y Entrenamiento en Neurocirugía [CIEN]) in a record time of 4 weeks. Eight committees were created and assigned a specific task. The event followed a strict protocol based on the double-room method, which consisted of 2 virtual rooms (A and B) hosted from 4 different physical locations to avoid lecture overlapping and connection drops. Quality and impact were measured by a videoconferencing platform and social media parameters as well as an audience perception survey. RESULTS: High quality was achieved in academic standards, worldwide assistance, schedule adherence, and security. The 2020 IWBNC hosted 25 internationally renowned speakers and offered 30 top-of-the-line multidisciplinary conferences. There were 3096 participants from 125 countries, and 22,266 live-stream views were registered. No technical or cybersecurity-related issues occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based academic meetings will continue to be a helpful educational tool for continuing medical education and continuing professional development. The 2020 IWBNC double-room method represents an alternative design that may be replicated by the academic community planning web congresses and similar events.","Ruiz-Barrera, Miguel A; Agudelo-Arrieta, Mariana; Aponte-Caballero, Rafael; Gutierrez-Gomez, Santiago; Ruiz-Cardozo, Miguel Angel; Madrinan-Navia, Humberto; Vergara-Garcia, David; Riveros-Castillo, William M; Saavedra, Javier M",World Neurosurg,,636
307356,COVID-19 Pandemic and Child Neurology Training: A Bumpy Road Ahead,2020,"AIM: This study sought to describe the experiences of critical care nurses caring for patients infected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DESIGN: A qualitative phenomenological design was used. METHODS: We enrolled 15 nurses who provided care for patients infected by COVID-19 purposively and through snowballing, using a phenomenological approach in critical care units of Iran's public hospitals between May and June 2020. The semi-structured interviews were carried out either via face-to-face or telephone and were analyzed using the 7-step method of Colaizzi. RESULTS: The experiences of nurses caring for patients infected with COVID-19 were categorized into four challenges, including psychological (eight subthemes), organizational (six subthemes), social (six subthemes), and professional (five subthemes). In general, based on the current classification, there seems to be a mixture of positive and negative effects on the psychological, social, and professional challenges and the negative effect only on the organizational challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Positive and negative emotions and experiences have coexisted for the critical care nurses since the COVID-19 outbreak. Emotional support and psychological counseling play an important role in maintaining nurses' optimal mental health during the COVID-19 crisis. Adequate protective equipment, financial and nonfinancial supports, effective communication, training and hiring of staff, and appropriate work shifts are also required to reduce nurses' negative experiences when providing care for the affected individuals.","Chegini, Zahra; Arab-Zozani, Morteza; Rajabi, Mohammad Reza; Kakemam, Edris",Nurs. forum,,636

METHODS: 39 Patients confirmed by RT-PCR were included. We collected clinical features, laboratory test results, smear sample information, and quarantine room information. Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were conducted. We analyzed the factors associated with environmental contamination. RESULT: Among 39 COVID-19 cases, 10 were asymptomatic and 37 were imported from aboard. We collected 271 swab samples from environmental surfaces related to observational patients. Eighteen swab samples from seven patients were positive. The highest contamination rates occurred on cups (100%), followed by hand sink (12.82%), toilet seat and flush (7.89%), telephone (5.56%), bedside table (5.56%), and floor drain (5.41%). The results showed that environmental surface contamination was associated with the clinical cycle threshold values for patients (P = 0.01) and the sampling interval time after the cases left their rooms (P = 0.03). The duration of environmental surface contamination was associated with the wet status of the sampling site (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that environmental contamination might be attributed to the viral load in the respiratory tracts of patients and the sampling interval time after the cases left their rooms. Moist surfaces were more vulnerable to remaining SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive. Our study highlights the importance of implementing strict chemical disinfection strategies in quarantine rooms.","Liu, Jie; Liu, Jingwen; He, Zheng; Yang, Zhicong; Yuan, Jun; Wu, Haoying; Zhu, Pingting; Fu, Xuesong; Lin, Yunwan; Zhang, Ying; Zhao, Zhengyang; He, Shiyu; Ma, Xiaowei",Int J Infect Dis,,636

Besides having a great impact on public health, this phenomenon raises the question of immunity generated by a single infection is sufficient to provide sterilizing/protective immunity to a subsequent SARS-CoV-2 re-exposure. The Golden Syrian hamster is a manageable animal model to explore immunological mechanisms able to counteract COVID-19, as it recapitulates pathological aspects of mild to moderately affected patients. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2-inoculated hamsters resolve infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts within seven days upon inoculation with the Cat01 (G614) SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Three weeks after the primary challenge, and despite high titres of neutralizing antibodies, half of the animals were susceptible to reinfection by both identical (Cat01, G614) and variant (WA/1, D614) SARS-CoV-2 isolates. However, upon re-inoculation, only nasal tissues were transiently infected with much lower viral replication than those observed after the first inoculation. These data indicate that a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is not sufficient to elicit a sterilizing immunity in hamster models but protects against lung disease.","Brustolin, Marco; Rodon, Jordi; Rodríguez de la Concepción, María Luisa; Ávila-Nieto, Carlos; Cantero, Guillermo; Pérez, Mónica; Te, Nigeer; Noguera-Julián, Marc; Guallar, Víctor; Valencia, Alfonso; Roca, Núria; Izquierdo-Useros, Nuria; Blanco, Julià; Clotet, Bonaventura; Bensaid, Albert; Carrillo, Jorge; Vergara-Alert, Júlia; Segalés, Joaquim",Emerg Microbes Infect,,636
308150,Economic Impact of Covid-19 Lockdown on Households in Nigeria,2021,"OBJECTIVES: This pilot survey aims to study the oral manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection and report the prevalence of oral signs and symptoms in COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 15 to June 10, 2020, we used an online questionnaire containing the oral manifestations that are expected to be associated with the COVID-19 infection. Adults in our survey who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 positive were confirmed with reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), and isolated in various hospitals in Cairo, Egypt. RESULTS: This pilot study included 58 (53.4% males and 46.6% females) COVID-19 patients ages 18-46 years, and 13 (22.4%) were healthcare workers. Our results showed that 67.2% of the patients had at least one manifestation related to the oral cavity and salivary glands, and 32.8% (n = 19) did not have any symptoms associated with the oral cavity. The highest prevalence symptoms were dry mouth 39.7% (n = 23), gustatory dysfunction as 34.5% (n = 20) loss of salt sensation, 29.3% (n = 17) loss of sweet sensation, and 25.9% (n = 15) altered food taste, while the least prevalent symptoms were tongue redness 8.8% (n = 5), and gingival bleeding 7% (n = 4). The most frequently associated symptoms were loss of salt and sweetness, as reported by 27.6% of the participants. However, there was no significant association between the incidence of oral symptoms and demographic data (age, gender, or job) of the patients (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Based on limited data, COVID-19 significantly impacts the oral cavity and salivary glands, as salivary gland-related symptoms and taste disorders are highly prevalent in COVID-19 patients.","El Kady, Dina M; Gomaa, Esraa Ahmad; Abdella, Walid Shaban; Ashraf Hussien, Reham; Abd ElAziz, Rawda H; Khater, Ahmad G A",,,636

308627,Media use and acute psychological outcomes during COVID-19 outbreak in China,2020,"The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, is native from South America but has become one of the most invasive species in the world. These ants heavily rely on trail pheromones for foraging and previous studies have focused on this signal to develop a strategy of chemical control. Here, we studied the effect of pre-exposure to the trail pheromone on sugar acceptance and olfactory learning in Argentine ants. We used the synthetic trail pheromone component (Z)-9-hexadecenal, which triggers the same attraction and trail following behavior than the natural trail pheromone. We found that pre-exposure to (Z)-9-hexadecenal increases the acceptance of sucrose solutions of different concentrations, thus changing the ants subjective evaluation of a food reward. On the other hand, although ants learned to associate an odor with a sucrose reward, pheromone pre-exposure did neither affect the learning nor the mid-term memory of the odor-reward association. Taking into account the importance of the Argentine ant as a pest and invasive organism, our results highlight the importance of pheromonal cues in resource evaluation, a fact that could be useful in control strategies implemented for this species.","Rossi, Natacha; Pereyra, Muriel; Moauro, Mariel Alejandra; Giurfa, Martin; d039,; Ettorre, Patrizia; Josens, Roxana",J. exp. biol,,636

308671,Pandemic pupils: COVID-19 and the impact on student paramedics,2020,"Post COVID-19 vaccine development, nations are now getting ready to face another challenge: how to effectively distribute vaccines among the masses to quickly achieve herd immunity against the infection. According to some experts, herd immunity for COVID-19 can be achieved by inoculating 67% of the population. India may find it difficult to achieve this service level target, owing to several infrastructural deficiencies in its vaccine supply chain. Effect of these deficiencies is to cause frequent lead time disruptions. In this context, we develop a novel modelling approach to identify few nodes, which require additional inventory allocations (strategic inventory reserves) to ensure minimum service level (67%) under the possibility of lead time disruptions. Later, through an illustrative case study on distribution of Japanese Encephalitis vaccine, we identify conditions under which strategic inventory reserve policy cannot be practically implemented to meet service level targets. Nodes fulfilling these conditions are termed as critical nodes and must be overhauled structurally to make the implementation of strategic inventory policy practically viable again. Structural overhauling may entail installation of better cold storage facilities, purchasing more quality transport vans, improving reliability of transport network, and skills of cold storage manager by training. Ideally, conditions for identifying critical nodes for COVID-19 vaccine distribution must be derived separately by substituting COVID-19 specific parametric values in our model. In the absence of the required data for COVID-19 scenario, JE specific criteria can be used heuristically to identify critical nodes and structurally overhaul them later for efficiently achieving service level targets.","Sinha, Priyank; Kumar, Sameer; Chandra, Charu",European journal of operational research,,636
308691,Commentary: COVID-19 pandemic — 1 Year later,2021,"Background: There are no known medicines or vaccines to control the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (nCoV). Antiviral peptides are superior to conventional drugs and may also be effective against COVID-19. Hence, we investigated the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (nCoV-RBD) that interacts with hACE2 for viral attachment and entry. Methods: Three strategies and bioinformatics approaches were employed to design potential nCoV-RBD - hACE2 interaction-blocking peptides that may restrict viral attachment and entry. Firstly, the key residues interacting with nCoV-RBD - hACE2 are identified and hACE2 sequence-based peptides are designed. Second, peptides from five antibacterial peptide databases that block nCoV-RBD are identified; finally, a chimeric peptide design approach is used to design peptides that can bind to key nCoV-RBD residues. The final peptides are selected based on their physiochemical properties, numbers and positions of key residues binding, binding energy, and antiviral properties. Results: We found that: (i) three amino acid stretches in hACE2 interact with nCoV-RBD; (ii) effective peptides must bind to three key positions of nCoV-RBD (Gly485/Phe486/Asn487, Gln493, and Gln498/Thr500/Asn501); (iii) Phe486, Gln493, and Asn501 are critical residues; (iv) AC20 and AC23 derived from hACE2 may block two key critical positions; (iv) DBP6 identified from databases can block the three sites of the nCoV-RBD and interacts with one critical position, Gln498; (v) seven chimeric peptides were considered promising, among which cnCoVP-3, cnCoVP-4, and cnCoVP-7 are the top three; and (vi) cnCoVP-4 meets all the criteria and is the best peptide. Conclusions: To conclude, using three different bioinformatics approaches, we identified 17 peptides that can potentially bind to the nCoV-RBD that interacts with hACE2. Binding these peptides to nCoV-RBD may potentially inhibit the virus to access hACE2 and thereby may prevent the infection. Out of 17, 10 peptides have promising potential and need further experimental validation.","Barh, Debmalya; Tiwari, Sandeep; Silva Andrade, Bruno; Giovanetti, Marta; Almeida Costa, Eduardo; Kumavath, Ranjith; Ghosh, Preetam; Góes-Neto, Aristóteles; Carlos Junior Alcantara, Luiz; Azevedo, Vasco",F1000Res,,636

This article attempts to account for the case when each individual entails in different kinds of interactions which have therefore different probabilities of transmitting the disease. The majority of these results can be also stated in the language of percolation theory. The main contributions of the article are: (1) Extend to this setting some results which were previously known in the case when each individual has only one kind of interactions. (2) Find an explicit formula for the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] which depends only on the probabilities of transmitting the disease along the different edges and the first two moments of the degree distributions of the associated graphs. (3) Motivated by the recent Covid-19 pandemic, we use the framework developed to compute the [Formula: see text] of a model disease spreading in populations whose trees and degree distributions are adjusted to several different countries. In this setting, we shall also compute the probability that the outbreak will not lead to an epidemic.

We assessed the use of the emergency department by frequent attenders during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and explored any changes in emergency department attendance by this group. METHODS: As part of ongoing improvement work, we utilised a cohort design to evaluate the difference in patterns of attendance for the frequent attender group in a single centre. We created a 2019 'top attender' cohort and a similar cohort for 2020. We compared admission patterns between the two time periods in order to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on this group. RESULTS: Both groups were predominately male. Mental health and substance misuse use problems were common across both cohorts. The majority of patients lived in a socio-economically deprived areas. The median number emergency department visits in 2019, for the top attender cohort was 6 (IQR: 4-9) vs 4 (IQR: 2-7) for the top attender cohort of 2020 (p < .0013). CONCLUSION: This single centre evaluation has shown a significant reduction in emergency department attendances for a frequent attender cohort in a single centre.

309900,COVID-19: Addressing Patients' Social Needs Can Help Reduce Health Inequity During COVID-19,2020,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global health burden and a major cause of disability and mortality. An early cascade of physical and structural damaging events starts immediately post-TBI. This primary injury event initiates a series of neuropathological molecular and biochemical secondary injury sequelae, that last much longer and involve disruption of cerebral metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and can lead to neuronal damage and death. Coupled to these events, recent studies have shown that lifestyle factors, including diet, constitute additional risk affecting TBI consequences and neuropathophysiological outcomes. There exists molecular cross-talk among the pathways involved in neuronal survival, neuroinflammation, and behavioral outcomes, that are shared among western diet (WD) intake and TBI pathophysiology. As such, poor dietary intake would be expected to exacerbate the secondary damage in TBI. Hence, the aim of this review is to discuss the pathophysiological consequences of WD that can lead to the exacerbation of TBI outcomes. We dissect the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal injury in this context. We show that currently available data conclude that intake of a diet saturated in fats, pre- or post-TBI, aggravates TBI, precludes recovery from brain trauma, and reduces the response to treatment.","Shaito, Abdullah; Hasan, Hiba; Habashy, Karl John; Fakih, Walaa; Abdelhady, Samar; Ahmad, Fatimah; Zibara, Kazem; Eid, Ali H; El-Yazbi, Ahmed F; Kobeissy, Firas H",EBioMedicine,,636

In addition, we sought to reveal the relationship between myocardial injury and clinical outcomes such as death, intensive care unit uptake and hospital stay, and the relationship between inflammatory parameters and cardiac biomarkers in a cardiovascular perspective. METHODS: Patients admitted to the emergency department in the Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, with laboratory or clinically and radiologically confirmed COVID-19 were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study, which was conducted from 11 March to 10 April 2020. The demographic (age and gender) and clinical (symptoms, co-morbidities, treatments, complications and outcomes) characteristics, laboratory findings, and results of cardiac examinations (cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiography) of patients during hospitalisation were collected from their medical records by two investigators. Data were analysed using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM). A two-sided p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analysis began on 11 April 2020. RESULTS: Mortality and intensive care unit admission rates were statistically significantly higher in patients with cardiac injury than in those without. There was a positive correlation between levels of high-sensitivity TNT and fibrinogen, D-dimer, ferritin, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (r = 0.24, p < 0.01; r = 0.37, p < 0.01; r = 0.25, p < 0.01, r = 0.34, p < 0.01; r = 0.31, p < 0.01).

METHODS: Using the convenience sampling method, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and questionnaires to determine psychological distress levels and sociodemographic characteristics were distributed online to 405 participants. RESULTS: The mean psychological distress score of the participants was 34.55 ± 8.07, while their mean sleep quality score was 6.39 ± 3.31. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was 55.1%. The psychological distress scores were higher among the men than the women, married participants than single ones, those with children than those without children and those who were employed than those who were not. The sleep quality of the single participants and the participants with low education levels was poorer. The sleep quality of those who left work in the pandemic period was poorer than those who were working from home/office and those who were already not employed before the pandemic. The sleep quality of those not working in the field of health was better than healthcare professionals and those not working at all. The scores for psychological distress were positively correlated with gender and negatively correlated with sleep quality levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on the psychological distress and sleep quality of adults. It is recommended for healthcare professionals to take the necessary psychosocial precautions.","Duran, Songül; Erkin, Özüm",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,636
310985,Apathy and anhedonia in adult and adolescent cannabis users and controls before and during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Calls to poison control about exposure to household cleaners have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. This dynamic may reflect increased exposure from public health efforts as well as health misinformation shared on social media. METHODS: We analyzed the dynamics of calls to the Regional Center for Poison Control and Prevention serving Massachusetts and Rhode Island (MARI PCC) and tweets discussing treating COVID-19 with house cleaners from January 20, 2020 to May 5, 2020. We obtained publicly available tweets discussing the use of household cleaners to ""cure COVID"" from the same time period with geographic co-ordinates indicating that they were emitted from the Greater Boston Area. RESULTS: Our main finding is that public health efforts were followed by a sustained increase in calls after March 15, 2020 (10 ± 2 calls per day before to 15 ± 2.5 after) while misinformation on social media was associated with intermittent spikes in calls. Overall, calls significantly increased during the study period by 34% as compared to the previous 8 years, mostly reporting unintentional ingestions with no serious effects. The daily volume of tweets and retweets was significantly correlated with daily call rates to MARI PCC for the surrounding 7-10 days. CONCLUSIONS: Health misinformation on social media about using household cleaning agents to treat COVID-19 and public health efforts lead to different dynamics in PCC calls. Public health efforts were followed by a sustained increase in calls after March 15, 2020 while misinformation on social media was followed by intermittent spikes in calls. This analysis is the first to link the geospatial dynamics of social media and public health interventions to poison center calls about exposure to household cleaners.","Chary, Michael A; Overbeek, Daniel L; Papadimoulis, Alexandria; Sheroff, Adina; Burns, Michele M",Clin Toxicol (Phila),,636

METHODS: We retrospectively compared outcomes in a cohort of critical COVID-19 patients who received standard care (SC Group) and those who, in addition, received convalescent plasma (CP Group). RESULTS: In total, 40 patients were included in each group. The median patient age was 53.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] 42-60.5), and the majority of patients required invasive ventilation (69, 86.2%). Plasma was harvested from donors after a median of 37 days (IQR 31-46) from the first positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result and 26 days (IQR 21-32) after documented viral clearance; it was administered after a median of 10 days (IQR 9-10) from the onset of symptoms and 2.5 days (IQR 2-4) from admission to intensive care unit. The primary endpoint of improvement in respiratory support status within 28 days was achieved in 26 patients (65%) in the SC Group and 31 patients (77.5%) in the CP Group (p = .32). The 28-day all-cause mortality (12.5% vs. 2.5%; p = .22) and viral clearance (65% vs. 55%; p = .49) were not significantly different between the two groups. Convalescent plasma was not significantly associated with the primary endpoint (adjusted hazard ratio 0.87; 95% confidence interval 0.51-1.49; p = .62). Adverse events were balanced between the two study groups. CONCLUSION: In severe COVID-19, convalescent plasma therapy was not associated with clinical benefits.

314365,The Impact of COVID-19 on Inpatient Psychiatry Resident Supervision,2020,"PURPOSE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities evacuated their campuses, requiring students to vacate on campus residences. The psychological outcomes of students who relocated during the pandemic remains unknown. We examined mandated relocation experiences related to self-reported worry, grief, loneliness, and depressive, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional survey data obtained from April 9 to August 4, 2020 on 791 young adults (ages 18-30 years) who were enrolled at a U.S. university. The CARES 2020 Project (COVID-19 Adult Resilience Experiences Study) is an online survey of young adults' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment relied on snowball sampling. Participants were asked if they were required to relocate from campus and among those who did, their experiences in moving. COVID-19-related worry and grief, loneliness, and depressive, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms were assessed. RESULTS: Approximately one-third of students reported being mandated to relocate. Students mandated to relocate reported more COVID-19-related grief, loneliness, and generalized anxiety symptoms compared to those who did not even after controlling for the severity level of local COVID-19 outbreaks. Students who had to leave behind valuable personal belongings reported more COVID-19-related worries, grief, and depressive, generalized anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Students who were mandated to relocate reported worse psychological outcomes compared to students who were not mandated to relocate. Our findings have implications for addressing the psychological impact of evacuating college campuses during public health emergencies and other disasters.","Conrad, Rachel C; Hahm, Hyeouk Chris; Koire, Amanda; Pinder-Amaker, Stephanie; Liu, Cindy H",J Psychiatr Res,,636
314429,The COVID-19 pandemic: a new challenge for syndromic surveillance,2020,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this open supplement study was to evaluate the effects of Pycnogenol® in comparison with controls on symptoms of post-COVID-19 syndrome and in improving endothelial function, microcirculation, inflammatory markers and oxidative stress over 3 months in symptomatic subjects recovering from COVID-19. METHODS: Sixty subjects recovering from symptomatic COVID-19 were included. One group of 30 followed a standard recovery management while 30 comparable subjects received a supplement of 150 mg Pycnogenol® daily (in 3 doses of 50 mg) in addition to standard management. RESULTS: Two groups of selected subjects were comparable at baseline. The groups progressively improved both with the SM (standard management) and with the SM in combination with the supplement. Patients, supplemented with Pycnogenol® showed significantly better improvement compared to the control group patients. No side effects from the supplementation were observed; tolerability was optimal. The progressive evolution over time was visible in all target measurements. Physiological tests. Endothelial function, low in all subjects at inclusion was assessed by flow mediated dilation (FMD) and finger reactive hyperemia in the microcirculation (laser Doppler measurements) after the release of an occluding suprasystolic cuff). It was significantly improved in the Pycnogenol® group after one month and after 3 months (p<0.05 vs controls). The rate of ankle swelling (RAS) by strain gauge decreased significantly in the supplemented group (p<0.05) in comparison with controls showing an improvement of the capillary filtration rate. At inclusion, the kidney cortical flow velocity indicated a decrease in perfusion (lower systolic and diastolic flow velocity) in all patients. Kidney cortical flow velocity increased significantly with the supplement (p<0.05) in comparison with controls with improvement in systolic velocity and in diastolic component. High sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and Il-6 plasma levels decreased progressively over 3 months with a significant more pronounced decrease in the supplement group (p<0.05). The number of patients with normal plasma IL-6 levels at the end of the study was higher (p<0,05) with the supplement. ESR followed the same pattern with a progressive and a more significant decrease in the supplemented subjects (p<0.02). Oxidative stress decreased significantly in the supplemented group (p<0.05) compared with the control group. Blood pressure and heart rate were normalized in all subjects in the supplement group; systolic pressure was significantly lower in the supplemented group (p<0,05) at the end of the study. Finally, the scores of Quality-of-life, mood and fatigue questionnaire and the Karnofsky scale performance index significantly improved in the supplement group (p<0.05) compared to controls after 1 and 3 months. All other blood parameters (including platelets and clotting factors) were within normal values at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, Pycnogenol® may offer a significant option for managing some of the signs and symptoms associated with post-COVID-19 syndrome. This pilot evaluation offers some potential rationale for the use of Pycnogenol® in this condition that will have significant importance in the coming years.","Belcaro, Gianni; Cornelli, Umberto; Cesarone, Maria Rosaria; Scipione, Claudia; Scipione, Valeria; Hu, Shu; Feragalli, Beatrice; Corsi, Marcello; Cox, David; Cotellese, Roberto; Hosoi, Morio",Minerva med,,636

To determine if administration of convalescent plasma to patients with coronavirus disease 2019 increases antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and improves outcome. DESIGN: Double-blind randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Hospital in New York. PATIENTS: Patients with polymerase chain reaction documented coronavirus disease 2019 infection. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized (4:1) to receive 2 U of convalescent plasma versus standard plasma. Antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were measured in plasma units and in trial recipients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Enrollment was terminated after emergency use authorization was granted for convalescent plasma. Seventy-four patients were randomized. At baseline, mean (SD) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (23.4 [5.6] and 22.5 [6.6]), percent of patients intubated (19% and 20%), and median (interquartile range) days from symptom onset to randomization of 9 (6-18) and 9 (6-15), were similar in the convalescent plasma versus standard plasma arms, respectively. Convalescent plasma had high neutralizing activity (median [interquartile range] titer 1:526 [1:359-1:786]) and its administration increased antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by 14.4%, whereas standard plasma administration led to an 8.6% decrease (p = 0.005). No difference was observed for ventilator-free days through 28 days (primary study endpoint): median (interquartile range) of 28 (2-28) versus 28 (0-28; p = 0.86) for the convalescent plasma and standard plasma groups, respectively. A greater than or equal to 2 point improvement in the World Health Organization scale was achieved by 20% of subjects in both arms (p = 0.99). All-cause mortality through 90 days was numerically lower in the convalescent plasma versus standard plasma groups (27% vs 33%; p = 0.63) but did not achieve statistical significance. A key prespecified subgroup analysis of time to death in patients who were intubated at baseline was statistically significant; however, sample size numbers were small.

315720,COVID-19 pandemic and allergen immunotherapy - an EAACI survey,2021,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence and associated factors of COVID-19 in people with flu-like syndrome in Ceará, Brazil. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has led to a worldwide public health emergency. More than 30,000 cases were confirmed in Brazil, especially in the States of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Ceará. The capital of the Ceará State is the one with the highest incidence of COVID-19 in Brazil. Estimating the prevalence of the disease and its associated factors is important to offer adequate health care. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study with secondary data of people notified with flu-like syndrome and COVID-19 test results. METHODS: 19,967 cases of flu-like syndrome were analysed according to the result of the COVID-19 test. Predictive variables were as follows: age range, sex, women in puerperium, presence or absence of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, haematological illness, immunodeficiencies, neurological diseases, obesity, renal diseases and Down syndrome. Robust Poisson regression models estimated the prevalence ratios of COVID-19. The research was reported via STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies. RESULTS: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the population was 10.37%. In the final model, the following variables were associated with COVID-19: aged people, male sex, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. CONCLUSION: Among the flu-like syndrome cases, COVID-19 prevalence was high. In the Ceará State, clinical factors such as aged people, male sex, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes can enhance the prevalence of COVID-19 by up to 2.57 times. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The identification of factors that are associated with the enhanced prevalence of COVID-19 facilitates early diagnosis, and adequate and prompt treatment. This knowledge may avoid an unfavourable prognosis of the disease.","Garces, Thiago S; Sousa, George J B; Florêncio, Raquel S; Cestari, Virna R F; Pereira, Maria L D; Moreira, Thereza M M",J. clin. nurs,,636

This has affected the management of many long-term conditions including osteoporosis as resources are diverted to cover urgent care. Osteoporosis is a public health concern worldwide and treatment is required for the prevention of further bone loss, deterioration of skeletal micro-architecture, and fragility fractures. This review provides information on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis. We also provide clinical recommendations on the adaptation of care pathways based on experience from five referral centres to ensure that patients with osteoporosis are still treated and to reduce the risk of fractures both for the individual patient and on a societal basis. We address the use of the FRAX tool for risk stratification and initiation of osteoporosis treatment and discuss the potential adaptations to treatment pathways in view of limitations on the availability of DXA. We focus on the issues surrounding initiation and maintenance of treatment for patients on parenteral therapies such as zoledronate, denosumab, teriparatide, and romosozumab during the pandemic. The design of these innovative care pathways for the management of patients with osteoporosis may also provide a platform for future improvement to osteoporosis services when routine clinical care resumes.","Hampson, G; Stone, M; Lindsay, J R; Crowley, R K; Ralston, S H",Calcif. tissue int,,636

CZZ-1T was pink-pigmented, Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, non-motile and aerobic. The 16S rRNA gene analysis indicated that strain CZZ-1T shows high similarities to Fluviicola taffensis DSM 16823T (92.6%) and Fluviicola hefeinensis KACC 16597T (92.5%) and less than 91% sequence similarities to other genus or species in the family Crocinitomicaceae. It was able to grow at 10-37 °C, with 0-6% (w/v) NaCl. It could hydrolyze gelatin, but could not reduce nitrates to nitrites. The predominant fatty acids of strain CZZ-1T were iso-C15:0 (51.3%), C15:0 2-OH (11.0%), iso-C17:0 3-OH (8.0%), C14: 0 (7.0%), iso-C15:1 G (6.8%) and Summed Feature 3 (C16:1 &#969;7c and/or C16:1 &#969;6c, 4.4%). The polar lipid profile was composed of five unidentified lipids, two unidentified phospholipids, one phosphatidylethanolamine, one unidentified aminolipid and one unidentified glycolipid. The predominant respiratory quinone was MK-6. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain CZZ-1T was 41.5 mol%. Based on data from phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic analysis in this study, strain CZZ-1T represents a novel species in a new genus in the family Crocinitomicaceae, for which the name Taishania pollutisoli gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed.

316433,"[COVID-19: Knowledge, risk perception and strategies for handling the pandemic]",2020,"BACKGROUND: Subsequent epidemic waves have already emerged in many countries and in the absence of highly effective preventive and curative options, the role of patient characteristics on the development of outcomes needs to be thoroughly examined, especially in middle-east countries where such epidemiological studies are lacking. There is a huge pressure on the hospital services and in particular, on the Intensive Care Units (ICU). Describing the need for critical care as well as the chance of being discharged from hospital according to patient characteristics, is essential for a more efficient hospital management. The objective of this study is to describe the probabilities of admission to the ICU and the probabilities of hospital discharge among positive COVID-19 patients according to demographics and comorbidities recorded at hospital admission. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of all patients with COVID-19 found in the Electronic Medical Records of Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital in Kuwait was conducted. The study included 3995 individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic) of all ages who tested positive from February 24th to May 27th, 2020, out of which 315 were treated in the ICU and 3619 were discharged including those who were transferred to a different healthcare unit without having previously entered the ICU. A competing risk analysis considering two events, namely, ICU admission and hospital discharge using flexible hazard models was performed to describe the association between event-specific probabilities and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Results showed that being male, increasing age and comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and weakened immune system increased the risk of ICU admission within 10 days of entering the hospital. CKD and weakened immune system decreased the probabilities of discharge in both females and males however, the age-related pattern differed by gender. Diabetes, which was the most prevalent comorbid condition, had only a moderate impact on both probabilities (18% overall) in contrast to CKD which had the largest effect, but presented only in 7% of those admitted to ICU and in 1% of those who got discharged. For instance, within 5 days a 50-year-old male had 19% (95% C.I.: [15,23]) probability of entering the ICU if he had none of these comorbidities, yet this risk jumped to 31% (95% C.I.: [20,46]) if he had also CKD, and to 27% in the presence of asthma/COPD (95% C.I.: [19,36]) or of weakened immune system (95% C.I.: [16,42]). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides useful insight in describing the probabilities of ICU admission and hospital discharge according to age, gender, and comorbidities among confirmed COVID-19 cases in Kuwait. A web-tool is also provided to allow the user to estimate these probabilities for any combination of these covariates. These probabilities enable deeper understanding of the hospital demand according to patient characteristics which is essential to hospital management and useful for developing a vaccination strategy.","Kipourou, Dimitra-Kleio; Leyrat, Clémence; Alsheridah, Nourah; Almazeedi, Sulaiman; Al-Youha, Sarah; Jamal, Mohammad H; Al-Haddad, Mohannad; Al-Sabah, Salman; Rachet, Bernard; Belot, Aurélien",BMC Public Health,,636

317109,Cardiovascular safety of hydroxychloroquine in the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"We consider the problem of estimating frame-level full human body meshes given a video of a person with natural motion dynamics. While much progress in this field has been in single image-based mesh estimation, there has been a recent uptick in efforts to infer mesh dynamics from video given its role in alleviating issues such as depth ambiguity and occlusions. However, a key limitation of existing work is the assumption that all the observed motion dynamics can be modeled using one dynamical/recurrent model. While this may work well in cases with relatively simplistic dynamics, inference with in-the-wild videos presents many challenges. In particular, it is typically the case that different body parts of a person undergo different dynamics in the video, e.g., legs may move in a way that may be dynamically different from hands (e.g., a person dancing). To address these issues, we present a new method for video mesh recovery that divides the human mesh into several local parts following the standard skeletal model. We then model the dynamics of each local part with separate recurrent models, with each model conditioned appropriately based on the known kinematic structure of the human body. This results in a structure-informed local recurrent learning architecture that can be trained in an end-to-end fashion with available annotations. We conduct a variety of experiments on standard video mesh recovery benchmark datasets such as Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW, demonstrating the efficacy of our design of modeling local dynamics as well as establishing state-of-the-art results based on standard evaluation metrics.","Li, Runze; Karanam, Srikrishna; Li, Ren; Chen, Terrence; Bhanu, Bir; Wu, Ziyan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12847v1.pdf,636
317151,COVID-19 and the Need for Leadership Training in Psychiatry,2020,"We present a method for novel view synthesis from input images that are freely distributed around a scene. Our method does not rely on a regular arrangement of input views, can synthesize images for free camera movement through the scene, and works for general scenes with unconstrained geometric layouts. We calibrate the input images via SfM and erect a coarse geometric scaffold via MVS. This scaffold is used to create a proxy depth map for a novel view of the scene. Based on this depth map, a recurrent encoder-decoder network processes reprojected features from nearby views and synthesizes the new view. Our network does not need to be optimized for a given scene. After training on a dataset, it works in previously unseen environments with no fine-tuning or per-scene optimization. We evaluate the presented approach on challenging real-world datasets, including Tanks and Temples, where we demonstrate successful view synthesis for the first time and substantially outperform prior and concurrent work.","Riegler, Gernot; Koltun, Vladlen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05511v1.pdf,636

Role of Leader Behavioral Integrity,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is responsible for many hospitalizations in intensive care units (ICU), with widespread use of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) which exposes patients to the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The characteristics of VAP in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on all patients hospitalized for COVID-19 during the first phase of the epidemic in one of the seven ICUs of the Pays-de-Loire region (North-West France) and who were on invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h. We studied the characteristics of VAP in these patients. VAP was diagnosed based on official recommendations, and we included only cases of VAP that were confirmed by a quantitative microbiological culture. FINDINGS: We analyzed data from 188 patients. Of these patients, 48.9% had VAP and 19.7% experienced multiple episodes. Our study showed an incidence of 39.0 VAP per 1000 days of IMV (until the first VAP episode) and an incidence of 33.7 VAP per 1000 days of IMV (including all 141 episodes of VAP). Multi-microbial VAP accounted for 39.0% of all VAP, and 205 pathogens were identified. Enterobacteria accounted for 49.8% of all the isolated pathogens. Bacteremia was associated in 15 (10.6%) cases of VAP. Pneumonia was complicated by thoracic empyema in five cases (3.5%) and by pulmonary abscess in two cases (1.4%). Males were associated with a higher risk of VAP (sHR 2.24 CI95% [1.18; 4.26] p = 0.013). INTERPRETATION: Our study showed an unusually high incidence of VAP in patients admitted to the ICU for severe COVID-19, even though our services were not inundated during the first wave of the epidemic. We also noted a significant proportion of enterobacteria. VAP-associated complications (abscess, empyema) were not exceptional.

We developed a candidate vaccine ZyCoV-D comprising of a DNA plasmid vector carrying the gene encoding the spike protein (S) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The S protein of the virus includes the receptor binding domain (RBD), responsible for binding to the human angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) receptor. The DNA plasmid construct was transformed into E. coli cells for large scale production. The immunogenicity potential of the plasmid DNA has been evaluated in mice, guinea pig, and rabbit models by intradermal route at 25, 100 and 500 µg dose. Based on the animal studies proof-of-concept has been established and preclinical toxicology (PCT) studies were conducted in rat and rabbit model.

Liver enzyme elevation is commonly seen in this group, but its clinical significance remains elusive. In this study, we calculated the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score for a cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and assessed its association with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, inflammatory cytokine levels, and clinical outcome. A total of 202 hospitalized participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal sampling were included in this analysis. FIB-4 was calculated for each participant using the alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, age, and platelet count. We evaluated the association between FIB-4 and mortality using both multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards model. Correlations between FIB-4 and SARS-CoV-2 RNA and cytokine levels were evaluated using the Spearman test. Among the 202 participants, 22 died. The median FIB-4 in participants who survived and died were 1.91 and 3.98 (P < 0.001 by Mann-Whitney U test), respectively. Each one-unit increment in FIB-4 was associated with an increased odds of death (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.36, 2.35; P < 0.001) after adjusting for baseline characteristics including sex, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, and history of liver diseases. During hospitalization, FIB-4 peaked and then normalized in the survival group but failed to normalize in the death group. FIB-4 was positively correlated with the level of SARS-CoV-2 viral load and monocyte-associated cytokines, especially interleukin-6 and interferon gamma-induced protein 10. Conclusion: FIB-4 is associated with mortality in COVID-19, independent of underlying conditions including liver diseases. FIB-4 may be a simple and inexpensive approach to risk-stratify individuals with COVID-19.","Li, Yijia; Regan, James; Fajnzylber, Jesse; Coxen, Kendyll; Corry, Heather; Wong, Colline; Rosenthal, Alexandra; Atyeo, Caroline; Fischinger, Stephanie; Gillespie, Elizabeth; Chishti, Rida; Baden, Lindsey; Yu, Xu G; Alter, Galit; Kim, Arthur; Li, Jonathan Z",,,636

There is no confirmed drug for the treatment of COVID-19 yet. As the disease spread fast and threaten human life, repositioning of FDA approved drugs may provide fast options for treatment. In this aspect, structure-based drug design could be applied as a powerful approach in distinguishing the viral drug target regions from the host. Evaluation of variations in SARS-CoV-2 genome may ease finding specific drug targets in the viral genome. In this study, 3458 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences isolated from all around the world were analyzed. Incidence of C17747T and A17858G mutations were observed to be much higher than others and they were on Nsp13, a vital enzyme of SARS-CoV-2. Effect of these mutations was evaluated on protein-drug interactions using in silico methods. The most potent drugs were found to interact with the key and neighbor residues of the active site responsible from ATP hydrolysis. As result, cangrelor, fludarabine, folic acid and polydatin were determined to be the most potent drugs which have potency to inhibit both the wild type and mutant SARS-CoV-2 helicase.

In late 2020, several variants of concern emerged globally, including the UK variant (B.1.1.7), the South Africa variant (B.1.351), Brazil variants (P.1 and P.2), and two related California variants of interest (B.1.429 and B.1.427). These variants are believed to have enhanced transmissibility. For the South Africa and Brazil variants, there is evidence that mutations in spike protein permit it to escape from some vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. On the basis of our extensive genome sequencing program involving 20,453 coronavirus disease 2019 patient samples collected from March 2020 to February 2021, we report identification of all six of these SARS-CoV-2 variants among Houston Methodist Hospital (Houston, TX) patients residing in the greater metropolitan area. Although these variants are currently at relatively low frequency (aggregate of 1.1%) in the population, they are geographically widespread. Houston is the first city in the United States in which active circulation of all six current variants of concern has been documented by genome sequencing.

The survey was conducted online during the period of national lockdown in 2020 and collected information on hours allocated to paid work, housework, child care, educational childcare and leisure by both members of the couple before and during the lockdown, as well as socio-demographic characteristics. Our sample consists of 961 couples of which 785 have children. Our results indicate that during the lockdown, despite a reduction in time assigned to paid work and an increase in time spent in unpaid activities for both members of the couple, gender gaps regarding the latter increased. Specifically, while the load of men and women's work for pay became more equitable, women took up a larger proportion of the additional housework and childcare. We found that some factors mitigated (whether the man reduced his hours of work or whether both partners kept on doing so) while others potentiated (whether the woman reduced her hours of work, whether she continued working from home, or whether the couple outsourced housework before lockdown) the changes in the within-couple gender gaps in unpaid activities.","Costoya, Victoria; Echeverría, Lucía; Edo, María; Rocha, Ana; Thailinger, Agustina",J Fam Econ Issues,,636

This paper considers research fatigue in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, to identify contributory factors and possible solutions for future post-disaster research. Design/methodology/approach: The authors draw on examples from the literature and their own observations from the recruitment and data collection phases of qualitative and quantitative studies, to provide an overview of possible research fatigue in the current COVID-19 pandemic, with implications for future post-disaster research. Findings: People affected by disasters sometimes receive multiple requests for study participation by separate teams who may not necessarily be coordinating their work. Not keeping participants informed of the research process or outcomes can lead to disillusionment. Being overburdened with too many research requests and failing to see any subsequent changes following participation may cause individuals to experience research fatigue. Originality/value: Guidelines for researchers wishing to reduce the occurrence of research fatigue include ensuring greater transparency within research; sharing of results and using oversight or gatekeeper bodies to aid coordination. Failure to restrict the number of times that people are asked to participate in studies risks poor participation rates. This can subsequently affect the quality of information with which to inform policy-makers and protect the health of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health disasters/emergencies.","Patel, Sonny S.; Webster, Rebecca K.; Greenberg, Neil; Weston, Dale; Brooks, Samantha K.",Disaster Prev.

Although isolated from others, people can still receive support from others, which might lower their COVID-19 anxiety. To examine the relationship between loneliness, perceived social support, and anxiety, we measured 222 Chinese participants' (54.50% female, M age = 31.53, SD = 8.17) trait loneliness, chronic anxiety before the outbreak, COVID-19 anxiety at the peak and decline stages of COVID-19, and their perceived social support across the three time points. The results showed that people's perceived social support dramatically increased from the pre-pandemic to the peak COVID-19 stage, and remained stable during the decline of COVID-19 stage. In contrast, COVID-19 anxiety decreased from the peak to the decline stage. Further, perceived social support consistently moderated the relationship between loneliness with both chronic anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety. The current study provides initial evidence that perceived social support provides protection for lonely people in daily life as well as during unexpected disasters, which will contribute to finding ways to alleviate lonely people's anxiety during this global health crisis.","Xu, Jianjie; Ou, Jingyi; Luo, Shuyi; Wang, Zhuojun; Chang, Edward; Novak, Claire; Shen, Jingyi; Zheng, Shaoying; Wang, Yinan",Front Psychol,,636

In this scenario, deep learning models are being proposed as a possible option to assist the diagnostic process based on chest X-ray and computed tomography images. Therefore, this research aims to automate the process of detecting COVID-19 cases from chest images, using convolutional neural networks (CNN) through deep learning techniques. The results can contribute to expand access to other forms of detection of COVID-19 and to speed up the process of identifying this disease. All databases used, the codes built, and the results obtained from the models' training are available for open access. This action facilitates the involvement of other researchers in enhancing these models since this can contribute to the improvement of results and, consequently, the progress in confronting COVID-19.","Soares, Lucas P.; Soares, Cesar P.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05494v1.pdf,636

A robust estimate is urgently needed to convey appropriate information to the society and the public, in the time of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis through a comprehensive literature search in major databases in English and Chinese, and two investigators conducted publication selection and data extraction independently. A meta-analysis was used to obtain estimates of pooled prevalence of cancer in patients with COVID-19 and determine the association of cancer with severe events, after assessment of potential heterogeneity, publication bias, and correction for the estimates when necessary. Total 38 studies comprising 7094 patients with COVID-9 were included; the pooled prevalence of cancer was estimated at 2.3% (95% confidence limit [CL] [0.018, 0.029]; P < .001) overall and 3.2% (95% CL [0.023, 0.041]; P < .001) in Hubei province; the corresponding estimates were 1.4% and 1.9% after correction for publication bias; cancer was significantly associated with the events of severe cases (odds ratio [OR] = 2.20, 95% CL [1.53, 3.17]; P < .001) and death (OR = 2.97, 95% CL [1.48, 5.96]; P = .002) in patients with COVID-19, there was no significant heterogeneity and a minimal publication bias. We conclude that cancer comorbidity is associated with the risk and severe events of COVID-19; special measures should be taken for individuals with cancer.","Tian, Yehong; Qiu, Xiaowei; Wang, Chengxiang; Zhao, Jianxin; Jiang, Xin; Niu, Wenquan; Huang, Jinchang; Zhang, Fengyu",Int. j. cancer,,636

326210,"Neighborhood Effects and Urban Inequalities: The Impact of Covid-19 on the Periphery of Salvador, Brazil",2020,"Transmission rates in epidemic outbreaks vary over time depending on the societal and government response to infections and mortality data, as evidenced in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following a mean field approach that models individuals like molecules in a well-mixed solution, I derive a modified SIR model in which the average daily contacts between susceptible and infected population are reduced based on the known infection levels, capturing the effects of social distancing policies. This approach yields a time-varying reproduction number that is continuously adjusted based on infection information through a negative-feedback term that is equivalent to Holling type II functions in ecology and Hill functions in chemistry and molecular biology. This feedback-adjustment of the transmission rate causes a structural reduction in infection peak, and simulations indicate that such reduction persists even in the presence of information delays. Simulations also show that a distancing policy based on infection data may substantially extend the duration of an epidemic. If the distancing rate is linearly proportional to infections, this model adds a single parameter to the original SIR, making it useful to illustrate the effects of social distancing enforced based on awareness of infections.","Franco, Elisa",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13216v2.pdf,636

326264,Prolonged grief related to COVID-19 deaths: Do we have to fear a steep rise in traumatic and disenfranchised griefs?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the time of global SARS-CoV-2 spread across the earth in February 2020, most of countries faced the problem of massive stress of their healthcare systems. In many cases, the structural stress was a result of incorrect allocation of medical care resources. In turn, this misallocation resulted from fear and apprehensions that superseded thorough calculations. A key role in exacerbating the healthcare sector overburdening was played by misleading information on the virus and disease caused by it. In the current paper, we study the situation in Russian healthcare system and advance recommendations how to avoid further crises. MATERIALS AND METHODS: (a) Surveying the medical personnel (231 doctors, 317 nurses and 355 ambulance medical workers of lower levels) in five hospitals and six ambulance centres in Moscow. (b) Content analysis of 3164 accounts in Russian segment of social networks (VKontakte, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Odnoklassniki); official and unofficial media (TV, informational webpages). RESULTS: We revealed positive-feedback loop that threatened the sustainability of Russian care sector. The main knot was occupied by incorrect/exaggerated media coverage of COVID-19. General public scared by misinformation in media and social networks, started to panic. This negative social background undermined the productivity of a significant part of medical workers who were afraid of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The most serious problems of Russian healthcare sector related to COVID-19 pandemic, were informational problems. The exaggerated information on COVID-19 had big negative influence upon Russian society and healthcare system, despite SARS-CoV-2 relatively low epidemiological hazard.","Sharov, Konstantin S",Eur J Clin Invest,,636

METHOD: Participants included women from the United States (n = 438; age: M = 31.3, SD = 12.71) who completed measures examining their use of video chatting services, self-objectification, video chatting appearance comparison, and appearance satisfaction. RESULTS: The total time spent on video chatting services was not associated with appearance satisfaction; however, self-objectification moderated the relationship between total hours of video chatting and appearance satisfaction. In addition, participants who engaged in more video chatting appearance comparisons reported lower face and body satisfaction. Furthermore, video chatting appearance comparison was associated with more frequent usage of certain Zoom features, such as the ""touch up my appearance"" feature, and more time spent looking at oneself on video calls. Finally, those who spent more time engaged with their families over video chatting services reported greater face and body satisfaction. DISCUSSION: The results of the current study demonstrate that time spent video chatting is not predictive of appearance satisfaction, but that self-objectification can exacerbate these associations.","Pfund, Gabrielle N; Hill, Patrick L; Harriger, Jennifer",Int J Eat Disord,,636

A preliminary study aimed at obtaining the Italian translation of the first 16 item of HTQ IV part [1] which was administered, 20 months after the disaster, at 281 survivors. In backward stepwise logistic regressions models, we estimated among the respondent's characteristics and event-related variables the best predictors of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).A Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) revealed a HTQ five-factors solution as best model, with satisfactory indexes of fit. HTQ held a positive correlation with both the SQD-P (r = .65, p < .05) and SQD-D subscales (r = .47, p < .05). ROC analysis suggested an area of .951 (95% CI = .917-.985) for the PTSD prediction. Basing on sensibility (.963) and specificity (.189), the best cut-off of 2.0 allowed discriminating for PTSD positive cases. After 20 months of the earthquake, the estimate prevalence of PTSD among the survivors is of 21.71% with a consistent and graded association between exposure variables and vulnerability factors (gender, age, exposure to death and home damage) and PTSD symptoms.","Pino, Olimpia; Pelosi, Annalisa; Artoni, Valentina; Mari, Massimo",Psychiatr. q,,636

METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 109 ICU patients were assessed for malnutrition based on GLIM and SGA criteria. The relation between nutrition assessment tools and duration of hospitalization and mortality were also evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of GLIM criteria concerning the detection of malnutrition was assessed based on the area under the curve. RESULTS: Malnutrition, according to the SGA and GLIM criteria, was found in 68 (62.4%) and 66 (61.5%) of our subjects. There was an optimal agreement between the GLIM criteria and the SGA criteria regarding malnutrition diagnosis (K = 0.85, P < 0.001).

Structured reporting systems simplify the interpretation and reporting of imaging examinations, serve as a framework for consistent generation of recommendations, and improve the quality of patient care. PURPOSE: To compose a comprehensive lexicon for description of the imaging findings and propose a grading system and structured reporting format for CT findings in COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We updated our published systematic review on imaging findings in COVID-19 to include 37 published studies pertaining to diagnostic features of COVID-19 in chest CT. Using the reported imaging findings of 3647 patients, we summarized the typical chest CT findings, atypical features, and temporal changes of COVID-19 in chest CT. Subsequently, we extracted a list of descriptive terms and mapped it to the terminology that is commonly used in imaging literature. RESULTS: We composed a comprehensive lexicon that can be used for documentation and reporting of typical and atypical CT imaging findings in COVID-19 patients. Using the same data, we propose a grading system with five COVID-RADS categories. Each COVID-RADS grade corresponds to a low, moderate, or high level of suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients. KEY POINTS: â¢ Chest CT has high sensitivity in diagnosing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). â¢ Structured reporting systems simplify the interpretation and reporting of imaging examinations, serve as a framework for consistent generation of recommendations, and improve the quality of patient care. â¢ The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","Salehi, Sana; Abedi, Aidin; Balakrishnan, Sudheer; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",Eur Radiol,,636
331387,Professionally responsible counseling about birth location during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The collection and clinical use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) as a therapy for COVID-19 infection is under development and early use in many centers worldwide. We conducted an international survey of centers undertaking studies of CCP to provide understanding of the common themes and differences between them. Sixty-four studies in 22 countries were identified from clinical trial registries and personal contacts of the authors. Twenty of the 64 centers (31%) from 12 of 22 countries (55%) responded to the survey. Of the 20 studies, 11 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 9 were case series. Only 4 of the RCTs plan to recruit 400 patients or more, and only 3 RCTs were blinded. The majority of studies will study the effect of CCP on sick patients requiring hospitalization and those requiring critical care, and none is examining the role of CCP in non-infected at-risk individuals. A wide variety of primary and secondary outcomes are being used. The donor eligibility criteria among the studies are very similar, and the use of plasmapheresis for the collection of CCP is almost universal. The planned dose of CCP ranges from as little as 200 mL to well over 1 L, but is 400 to 800 mL or 4 mL/kg or greater in all the RCTs. There is considerable variability in donor antibody testing with no consistency regarding the cut-off for antibody titer for acceptance as CCP or the use of pathogen-inactivation. Our survey provides an understanding of the similarities and differences among the studies of CCP, and that by virtue of their design some studies may be more informative than others.","Murphy, Michael; Estcourt, Lise; Grant-Casey, John; Dzik, Sunny",Transfus Med Rev,,636

Among these connections is the idea that wearable technologies – with their attendant claims to know more and know better about the relationship between human bodies and daily life – are able to predict the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and, in doing so, to help mitigate its spread. This article considers this imaginary through a case study of the Oura ‘smart ring’ and Oura’s partnership with medical researchers and the National Basketball Association. Through a close, critical reading of popular press reports, I examine how Oura is imagined as a productive articulation between technology and public health capable of compensating for the failure of the United States government to implement adequate COVID-19 testing. This analysis demonstrates one way cultural studies scholars might interrogate and map the politics of this unfolding conjuncture – that is, to understand how a series of public failings is offloaded to private companies in an effort to develop quick solutions that only further entrench existing crises.","Gilmore, James N.",Cultural Studies,,636

332030,Pregnancy during COVID-19 pandemic - Maternal and neonatal outcomes: A concise review,2020,"Negative infectious disease externalities are less prevalent in the absence of government intervention and less costly to society than is often supposed. That is so for three reasons. (1) Unlike externality-creating behaviors in many classical externality contexts, such behaviors are often self-limiting in the context of infectious disease. (2) In market economies, behaviors that may create infectious disease externalities typically occur at sites that are owned privately and visited voluntarily. Owners have powerful incentives to regulate such behaviors at their sites, and visitors face residual infection risk contractually. (3) The social cost of infectious disease externalities is limited by the cheapest method of avoiding externalized infection risk. That cost is modest compared to the one usually imagined: the value of life (or health) lost to the disease if government does not intervene. We elaborate these arguments in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Leeson, Peter T; Rouanet, Louis",Southern economic journal,,636

This study aimed to investigate the coping strategies among the healthcare workers from different countries and their attitude towards teamwork during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by using an online, web-based questionnaire, which was distributed to healthcare workers from 32 countries during April and May 2020. The respondents were recruited by the non-random convenience sampling method. Results: A total of 2166 respondents responded to the survey and the majority were working in low- and middle-income countries. Among them, 36% were doctors, 24% were nurses and 40% worked in other healthcare sectors. More than 70% of the respondents answered that ""getting family support"" and ""positive thinking"" were coping methods for them during the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately half of the respondents worshiped according to their belief and conducted prayers (58.4%) and had adequate sleep and food intake (48.2%). The significant associations were observed between attitude score towards interprofessional teamwork and gender (pâ¯=â¯0.009), age (31-45 years) (pâ¯<â¯0.001), marital status (pâ¯<â¯0.001), occupation (pâ¯<â¯0.001), working experience (2-5 years) (pâ¯=â¯0.005), current workplace (clinics) (pâ¯=â¯0.002). Conclusion: The local healthcare authorities should promote coping methods and develop an innovative way to encourage practicing among healthcare workers. Digital mental health support interventions or workplace mental health support teams should be accessible to protect mental wellbeing among healthcare workers.","Nu Htay, Mila Nu; Marzo, Roy Rillera; Bahari, Rafidah; AlRifai, Ayesha; Kamberi, Fatjona; El-Abasiri, Radwa Abdullah; Nyamache, Jeldah Mokeira; Hlaing, Htet Aung; Hassanein, Mayada; Moe, Soe; Abas, Adinegara Lutfi; Su, Tin Tin",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,,636

333060,The Impact of Lockdown During the COVID-19 Outbreak on Dietary Habits in Various Population Groups: A Scoping Review,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Since the start of the pandemic, millions of people have been infected, with thousands of deaths. Many foci worldwide have been identified in retirement nursing homes, with a high number of deaths. Our study aims were to evaluate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the retirement nursing homes, the predictors to develop symptoms, and death. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective study enrolling all people living in retirement nursing homes (PLRNH), where at least one SARS-CoV-2 infected person was present. Medical and clinical data were collected. Variables were compared with Student's t-test or Pearson chi-square test as appropriate. Uni- and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate variables' influence on infection and symptoms development. Cox proportional-hazards model was used to evaluate 30 days mortality predictors, considering death as the dependent variable. We enrolled 382 subjects. The mean age was 81.15±10.97 years, and males were 140(36.7%). At the multivariate analysis, mental disorders, malignancies, and angiotensin II receptor blockers were predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection while having a neurological syndrome was associated with a lower risk. Only half of the people with SARS-CoV-2 infection developed symptoms. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neurological syndrome were correlated with an increased risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 related symptoms. Fifty-six (21.2%) people with SARS-CoV-2 infection died; of these, 53 died in the first 30 days after the swab's positivity. Significant factors associated with 30-days mortality were male gender, hypokinetic disease, and the presence of fever and dyspnea. Patients' autonomy and early heparin treatment were related to lower mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS: We evidenced factors associated with infection's risk and death in a setting with high mortality such as retirement nursing homes, that should be carefully considered in the management of PLRNH.","De Vito, Andrea; Fiore, Vito; Princic, Elija; Geremia, Nicholas; Panu Napodano, Catello Mario; Muredda, Alberto Augusto; Maida, Ivana; Madeddu, Giordano; Babudieri, Sergio",PLoS One,,636

The concept draws a close association between viral biology on the one hand, and information science on the other–it is an illustration and prime example of bioinformationalism that brings together two of the most powerful forces that now drive cultural evolution. The concept of viral modernity applies to viral technologies, codes and ecosystems in information, publishing, education and emerging knowledge (journal) systems. This paper traces the relationship between epidemics, quarantine, and public health management and outlines elements of viral-digital philosophy (VDP) based on the fusion of living and technological systems. We discuss Covid-19 as a ‘bioinformationalist’ response that represents historically unprecedented level of sharing information from the sequencing of the genome to testing for a vaccination. Finally, we look at the US response to Covid-19 through the lens of infodemics and post-truth.

Although kidney is a crucial target of Ni toxicity, information on autophagy and the potential mechanisms of Ni-induced renal toxicity are still poorly described. As we discovered, NiCl2 could induce renal damage including decrease in renal weight, renal histological alterations, and renal function injury. According to the obtained results, NiCl2 could obviously increase autophagy, which was characterized by increase of LC3 expression and decrease of p62 expression. Meanwhile, the result of ultrastructure observation showed increased autolysosomes numbers in the kidney of NiCl2-treated mice. In addition, NiCl2 increased mRNA and protein levels of autophagy flux proteins including Beclin1, Atg5, Atg12, Atg16L1, Atg7, and Atg3. Furthermore, NiCl2 induced autophagy through AMPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways which featured down-regulated expression levels of p-PI3K, p-AKT and p-mTOR and up-regulated expression levels of p-AMPK and p-ULK1. In summary, the above results indicate involvement of autophagy in renal injury induced by NiCl2, and NiCl2 induced autophagy via PI3K/AKT/mTOR and AMPK pathways in mouse kidney.","Yin, Heng; Zuo, Zhicai; Yang, Zhuangzhi; Guo, Hongrui; Fang, Jing; Cui, Hengmin; Ouyang, Ping; Chen, Xia; Chen, Jian; Geng, Yi; Chen, Zhengli; Huang, Chao; Zhu, Yanqiu",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,636

The most important determinant of disease severity is age, with individuals over 65 years having the greatest risk of requiring intensive care, and men are more susceptible than women. In contrast to other respiratory viral infections, young children seem to be less severely affected. It is now clear that mild to severe acute infection is not the only outcome of COVID-19, and long-lasting symptoms are also possible. In contrast to severe acute COVID-19, such 'long COVID' is seemingly more likely in women than in men. Also, postinfectious hyperinflammatory disease has been described as an additional outcome after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here I discuss our current understanding of the immunological determinants of COVID-19 disease presentation and severity and relate this to known immune-system differences between young and old people and between men and women, and other factors associated with different disease presentations and severity.","Brodin, Petter",Nat Med,,636

Our study included three females and two male patients aged between 27 and 51 with a mean age of 39. Out of the five, four patients had a mild COVID-19 infection, and one patient had mild COVID-19 pneumonia. After 18-25 days of the disappearance of COVID-19 symptoms, subacute thyroiditis was developed in patients. Laboratory tests such as thyroid hormones and, especially, free thyroxin showed high levels while the thyroid-stimulating hormone was found to be low. The thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody, anti-thyroid peroxidase, and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies were negative in all patients while the inflammatory markers were high. Thyroid ultrasound showed diffuse hypoechoic areas and diffused enlargement. There was no iodine uptake observed in the thyroid scintigraphy. The patients were diagnosed with subacute thyroiditis and prescribed oral prednisolone therapy. After a few days of starting the treatment, symptoms disappeared in all patients, and after four weeks of the onset of subacute thyroiditis symptoms, inflammatory markers turned to normal range in all patients.

Investigating the adaptive immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, in patients who have recovered from this disease could contribute to our understanding of the natural host immune response. We enrolled 38 participants in this study. 7 healthy participants and 31 COVID-19 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and categorized them into 3 groups according to their previous clinical presentations: 10 moderate, 9 mild, and 12 asymptomatic. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral lymphocyte counts in recovered patients showed significantly increased levels of CD4+ T cells in patients with a history of mild and moderate COVID-19 symptoms compared with those healthy individuals (p < 0.05 and p < 0.0001 respectively). whereas no significant difference was observed in the CD8+ T cell percentage in COVID-19-recovered patients compared with healthy individuals. Our study demonstrated that antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (anti-S) IgG antibody production could be observed in all recovered COVID-19 patients, regardless of whether they were asymptomatic (p < 0.05)or presented with mild (p < 0.0001) or moderate symptoms (p < 0.01) . Anti-S IgG antibodies could be detected in participants up to 90 days post-infection. In conclusion, the lymphocyte levels in recovered patients were associated with the clinical presentation of the disease, and further analysis is required to investigate relationships between different clinical presentations and lymphocyte activation and function.","Alsayb, May A; Dakhilallah D Alsamiri, Ali; Makhdoom, Hatem Q; Alwasaidi, Turki; Mohammed Osman, Haitham; Mahallawi, Waleed H",,,636

Countries and towns took various measures such as turning school and work to remote and prohibiting social relations via curfews. In order to estimate the impact of these lockdown scenarios, we propose a multi-layer undirected weighted network, where vertices are the individuals of a town that tend to interact locally. In this network, there are seven layers such as""household"",""work"",""school"", and""friends"". Edges in a layer represent interactions that can cause a disease to spread. Depending on the type and intensity of the interactions, transmission probabilities are assigned to edges. With this layered-architecture, various lock down scenarios can be simulated by adding or removing layers. Our simulations indicate that locking down""friends""layer has the highest impact.","Turker, Meliksah; Bingol, Haluk O.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02272v1.pdf,636
339021,COVID-19 Pandemic and Infertility: Gynecological Dilemma from an Indian Perspective,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The lack of resources and coordination to face the coronavirus epidemic raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we still have memories of the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims to propose guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemic in France. METHODS: The authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and in local initiatives in France. RESULTS: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities among patients with mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found among patients with mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which are risk factors for severe covid-19 infection; (2) age (the elderly form the population most vulnerable to the coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioural disorders, which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability as a result of stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly suited to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortages of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds have been closed, wards have high densities of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, and medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. There are also major issues when referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain the continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of ""COVID+ units"". These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants are placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nursing staff receives specific training, daily medical check-ups and close psychological support. Family visits are prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management are organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support patients when they get back home and to help them cope with the experience of confinement, which is liable to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of community mental health facilities is particularly disturbing for patients, but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of suicide risk and psycho-education strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private practice psychiatrists also have a crucial role of information towards their patients on confinement and barrier measures, and also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent in confinement: maintenance of regular sleep r, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. DISCUSSION: French mental healthcare is now facing a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the confinement of the general population.","Chevance, A; Gourion, D; Hoertel, N; Llorca, P-M; Thomas, P; Bocher, R; Moro, M-R; Laprévote, V; Benyamina, A; Fossati, P; Masson, M; Leaune, E; Leboyer, M; Gaillard, R",Encephale,,636

METHODS: This is a prospective study enrolling all ACHD patients who answered a questionnaire dedicated telematic cardiovascular examination. RESULTS: A total of 289 patients were enrolled, 133 (47%) were male, 25 (9%) were affected by a genetic syndrome. The median age was 38 (29-51) years, whereas the median time interval between the last visit and the telematic follow-up was 9.5 (7.5-11.5) months. Overall, 35 patients (12%) reported a worsening of fatigue in daily life activity, 17 (6%) experienced chest pain, 42 (15%) had presyncope and 2 (1%) syncope; in addition, 28 patients (10%) presented peripheral edema and 14 (5%) were orthopneic. A total of 116 (40%) patients reported palpitations and 12 had at least one episode of atrial fibrillation and underwent successful electrical (8) or pharmacological (4) cardioversion. One patient was admitted to the emergency department for uncontrolled arterial hypertension, five for chest pain, and one for heart failure. Two patients presented fever but both had negative COVID-19 nasal swab. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of telemedicine dramatically increased and here we report a positive experience in ACHD patients. The postpandemic role of telemedicine will depend on permanent regulatory solutions and this early study might encourage a more systematic telematic approach for ACHD patients.","Grandinetti, Maria; Di Molfetta, Arianna; Graziani, Francesca; Delogu, Angelica Bibiana; Lillo, Rosa; Perri, Gianluigi; Pavone, Natalia; Bruno, Piergiorgio; Aspromonte, Nadia; Amodeo, Antonio; Crea, Filippo; Massetti, Massimo",J. cardiovasc. med.

As the virus belongs to the same genus of MERS and SARS, researchers have been trying to draw lessons from previous outbreaks to find a potential cure. Although there were five Phase I human vaccine trials against SARS and MERS, the lack of data in humans provided us with limited benchmarks that could help us design a new vaccine for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, we showcase the similarities in structures of virus components between SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in areas relevant to vaccine design. Using the ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization (WHO) databases, we shed light on the 16 current approved clinical trials worldwide in search for a COVID-19 vaccine. The different vaccine platforms being tested are Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccines, DNA and RNA-based vaccines, inactivated vaccines, protein subunits, and viral vectors. By thoroughly analyzing different trials and platforms, we also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using each type of vaccine and how they can contribute to the design of an adequate vaccine for COVID-19. Studying past efforts invested in conducting vaccine trials for MERS and SARS will provide vital insights regarding the best approach to designing an effective vaccine against COVID-19.","Al-Kassmy, Jawad; Pedersen, Jannie; Kobinger, Gary",Viruses,,636

OBJECTIVE: To systematically review (1) the reliability of the physical examination of the spine using telehealth as it pertains to spinal pathology and (2) patient satisfaction with the virtual spine physical examination. METHODS: We searched EMBASE, PubMed, Medline Ovid, and SCOPUS databases from inception until April 2020. Eligible studies included those that reported on performing a virtual spine physical examination. Two reviewers independently assessed all potential studies for eligibility and extracted data. The primary outcome of interest was the reliability of the virtual spine physical exam. Secondary outcomes of interest were patient satisfaction with the virtual encounter. RESULTS: A total of 2321 studies were initially screened. After inclusion criteria were applied, 3 studies (88 patients) were included that compared virtual with in-person spine physical examinations. These studies showed acceptable reliability for portions of the low back virtual exam. Patient satisfaction surveys were conducted in 2 of the studies and showed general satisfaction (>80% would recommend). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the virtual spine examination may be comparable to the in-person physical examination for low back pain, though there is a significant void in the literature regarding the reliability of the physical examination as it pertains to specific surgical pathology of the spine. Because patients are overall satisfied with virtual spine assessments, validating a virtual physical examination of the spine is an important area that requires further research.","Piche, Joshua; Butt, Bilal B; Ahmady, Arya; Patel, Rakesh; Aleem, Ilyas",Global Spine J,,636
341220,COVID-19: Assessing the impact of lockdown on recreational athletes,2021,"Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory condition, accounts for numerous dermatology visits for patients with skin of color. The inflammatory process often leads to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, especially in patients with skin of color, which may negatively impact quality of life. We present a case that demonstrates clinical improvement of atopic dermatitis, post inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and lightening of pigmentation in clinically non-lesional areas after initiation of dupilumab. Lightening of the patient's skin even in areas that previously appeared clinically normal supports the scientific evidence that non-lesional skin in those with atopic dermatitis is often subclinically involved. For skin of color patients, aggressive treatment with duplimab may accelerate the return of the patient's overall normal skin tone.

Data on the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy are limited to small case series. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes in pregnancy and the vertical transmission potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical records were retrospectively reviewed for 116 pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia from 25 hospitals in China between January 20, 2020, and March 24, 2020. Evidence of vertical transmission was assessed by testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal pharyngeal swab samples. RESULTS: The median gestational age on admission was 38+0 (interquartile range, 36+0-39+1) weeks. The most common symptoms were fever (50.9%, 59/116) and cough (28.4%, 33/116); 23.3% (27/116) patients presented without symptoms. Abnormal radiologic findings were found in 96.3% (104/108) of cases. Of the 116 cases, there were 8 cases (6.9%) of severe pneumonia but no maternal deaths. One of 8 patients who presented in the first trimester and early second trimester had a missed spontaneous abortion. Of 99 patients, 21 (21.2%) who delivered had preterm birth, including 6 with preterm premature rupture of membranes. The rate of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation was 6.1% (6/99). One case of severe neonatal asphyxia resulted in neonatal death. Furthermore, 86 of the 100 neonates tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 had negative results; of these, paired amniotic fluid and cord blood samples from 10 neonates used to test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 had negative results. CONCLUSION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and spontaneous preterm birth. There is no evidence of vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection when the infection manifests during the third trimester of pregnancy.","Yan, Jie; Guo, Juanjuan; Fan, Cuifang; Juan, Juan; Yu, Xuechen; Li, Jiafu; Feng, Ling; Li, Chunyan; Chen, Huijun; Qiao, Yuan; Lei, Di; Wang, Chen; Xiong, Guoping; Xiao, Fengyi; He, Wencong; Pang, Qiumei; Hu, Xiaoling; Wang, Suqing; Chen, Dunjin; Zhang, Yuanzhen; Poon, Liona C; Yang, Huixia",Am J Obstet Gynecol,,636

Materials and methods: All the skeletally immature (younger than 18 ys) patients managed in the Emergency Unit of our Hospital between March 8 2020 and 8thApril 2020 (COVID-19 period, C19) for a shoulder and elbow trauma were retrospectively included and compared to patients with similar ages admitted in the same period of 2019 (no COVID-19 period, NC19). Six categories of diagnosis were distinguished: 1) contusions, 2) no physeal fractures, 3) physeal fractures (Salter-Harris), 4) sprains/subluxations,5) dislocations, 6) others (tendinitis, wounds, low back pain, joint inflammation). According to the mechanism of injury we arbitrarily distinguished 6 subgroups: a) Accidental fall;b) Sport trauma; c) Accident at school; d) High energy trauma occurred by car, public transport, pedestrian investment; e) Fall from high. Results: During the C19 period, the number of total accesses in our Trauma Center steeply decreased: two thirds less. Regardless of the patient age, we performed 65% less first aid shoulder/elbow services. Skeletally immature patients treated at our Trauma Center for all types of injury during the NC19 period were 350 and 54 during the C19 period; therefore, the influx of pediatric patients during the C19 period decreased by 84.6%. Furthermore: a) in the C19 period there were no cases of fractures, physeal fractures and dislocations of the shoulder; b) in the C19 period we had no cases of contusion, physeal fractures, and dislocations of the elbow; c) during the C19 period we observed the absence of high-energy, sports and school injuries; d) during the pandemic, shoulder and elbow injuries mainly occurred as a result of accidental fall at home. Conclusions: The pandemic forced us to become aware of the ways and places where skeletally immature subjects report shoulder and elbow traumas; therefore, it would be desirable that more considerable attention be directed towards the prevention of injury in areas at risk.","Gumina, S; Proietti, R; Villani, C; Carbone, S; Candela, V",,,636

342544,"Impact of COVID-19 on Selected Criminal Activities in Dhaka, Bangladesh",2021,"Coronaviruses constitute a family of viruses that gives rise to respiratory diseases. As COVID-19 is highly contagious, early diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial for an effective treatment strategy. However, the RT-PCR test which is considered to be a gold standard in the diagnosis of COVID-19 suffers from a high false-negative rate. Chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis has emerged as a feasible and effective diagnostic technique towards this objective. In this work, we propose the COVID-19 classification problem as a three-class classification problem to distinguish between COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia classes. We propose a three-stage framework, named COV-ELM. Stage one deals with preprocessing and transformation while stage two deals with feature extraction. These extracted features are passed as an input to the ELM at the third stage, resulting in the identification of COVID-19. The choice of ELM in this work has been motivated by its faster convergence, better generalization capability, and shorter training time in comparison to the conventional gradient-based learning algorithms. As bigger and diverse datasets become available, ELM can be quickly retrained as compared to its gradient-based competitor models. The proposed model achieved a macro average F1-score of 0.95 and the overall sensitivity of ${0.94 \pm 0.02} at a 95% confidence interval. When compared to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the COV-ELM is found to outperform its competitors in this three-class classification scenario. Further, LIME has been integrated with the proposed COV-ELM model to generate annotated CXR images. The annotations are based on the superpixels that have contributed to distinguish between the different classes. It was observed that the superpixels correspond to the regions of the human lungs that are clinically observed in COVID-19 and Pneumonia cases.","Rajpal, Sheetal; Agarwal, Manoj; Rajpal, Ankit; Lakhyani, Navin; Saggar, Arpita; Kumar, Naveen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08637v6.pdf,636
342645,[Needs of long-term nursing in the COVID-19 pandemic],2020,"By analyzing COVID-19 sequential COVID-19 test results of patients across the United States, we herein attempt to quantify some of the observations we've made around long-term infection (and false-positive rates), as well as provide observations on the uncertainty of sampling variability and other dynamics of COVID-19 infection in the United States. Retrospective cohort study of a registry of RT-PCR testing results for all patients tested at any of the reference labs operated by Labcorp® including both positive, negative, and inconclusive results, from March 1, 2020 to January 28, 2021, including patients from all 50 states and outlying US territories. The study included 22 million patients with RT-PCR qualitative test results for SARS-CoV-2, of which 3.9 million had more than one test at Labcorp. We observed a minuscule <0.1% basal positive rate for follow up tests >115 days, which could account for false positives, long-haulers, and/or reinfection but is indistinguishable in the data. In observing repeat-testing, for patients who have a second test after a first RT-PCR, 30% across the cohort tested negative on the second test. For patients who test positive first and subsequently negative within 96 h (40% of positive test results), 18% of tests will subsequently test positive within another 96-h span. For those who first test negative and then positive within 96 h (2.3% of negative tests), 56% will test negative after a third and subsequent 96-h period. The sudden changes in RT-PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2 from this large cohort study suggest that negative test results during active infection or exposure can change rapidly within just days or hours. We also demonstrate that there does not appear to be a basal false positive rate among patients who test positive >115 days after their first RT-PCR positive test while failing to observe any evidence of widespread reinfection.","Sullivan, Adam; Alfego, David; Poirier, Brian; Williams, Jonathan; Adcock, Dorothy; Letovsky, Stan",Front Public Health,,636

343547,Perspective: What a Difference a Disaster Makes: The Telehealth Revolution in the Age of COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Forest fires impact on soil, water and biota resources has been widely researched. Although forest fires profoundly impact the atmosphere and air quality across the ecosystems, much less research has been developed to examine its impact on the current pandemic. In-situ air pollution data were utilized to examine the effects of the 2020 forest fire on atmosphere and coronavirus (COVID 19) casualties. The spatiotemporal concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) were collected from August 1 to October 30 for 2020 (fire year) and 2019 (reference year). Both spatial (Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression) and non spatial (negative binomial regression) regression analysis was performed to assess the adverse effects of fire emission on human health. The in situ data led measurements showed that the maximum increases in PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations were clustered in the West Coastal fire-prone states during the August 1 to October 30 period. The average concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and NO2 were increased in all the fire states affected badly by forest fires. The average PM2.5 concentration over the period was recorded as 7.9, 6.3, 5.5, and 5.2 for California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington in 2019, which was increased up to 24.9, 13.4, 25, and 17 in 2020. Both spatial and non-spatial regression models exhibited a statistically significant association between fire emission and COVID 19 incidents. A total of 30 models were developed for analyzing the spatial non-stationary and local association between the predictor and response factors. All these spatial models have demonstrated a statistically significant association between fire emissions and COVID counts. More thorough research is needed to better understand the complex association between forest fire and human health.","Sannigrahi, Srikanta; Maiti, Arabinda; Pilla, Francesco; Zhang, Qi; Bar, Somnath; Keesstra, Saskia; Cerda, Artemi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03130v1.pdf,636

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) functions as the primary cell entry receptor for Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is thought to cause distinct clinical features between children and old people. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether differences exist in the level of expression and distribution of ACE2 between neonatal and adult rat lungs. The lung tissues from rats of various ages were used to investigate the expression patterns of ACE2. Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were used to quantify or identify the localization of ACE2 in rat lungs. ACE2 was homogenously expressed in fewer alveolar type II (AT2) cells in the neonatal lung, with no polarization to the alveolar space and additional expression in pulmonary endothelium when compared to adult rat lungs. These findings suggest that the patterns of ACE2 distribution and cellular localization in rat lungs change with age.","Zhao, Depeng; Chen, Xueyu; Han, Dongshan; Zhong, Junyan; Zhang, Su-E; Yang, Chuanzhong",,,636

345064,Mood Responses Associated With COVID-19 Restrictions,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread throughout the world's population since its initial discovery in 2019. The virus infects cells via a glycosylated spike protein located on its surface. The protein primarily binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, using glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) as co-receptors. Here, we performed bioinformatics and molecular dynamics simulations of the spike protein to investigate the existence of additional GAG binding sites on the receptor-binding domain (RBD), separate from previously reported heparin-binding sites. A putative GAG binding site in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the protein was identified, encompassing residues 245-246. We hypothesized that GAGs of a sufficient length might bridge the gap between this site and the PRRARS furin cleavage site, including the mutation S247R. Docking studies using GlycoTorch Vina and subsequent MD simulations of the spike trimer in the presence of dodecasaccharides of the GAGs heparin and heparan sulfate supported this possibility. The heparan sulfate chain bridged the gap, binding the furin cleavage site and S247R. In contrast, the heparin chain bound the furin cleavage site and surrounding glycosylation structures, but not S247R. These findings identify a site in the spike protein that favors heparan sulfate binding that may be particularly pertinent for a better understanding of the recent UK and South African strains. This will also assist in future targeted therapy programs that could include repurposing clinical heparan sulfate mimetics.","Schuurs, Zachariah P; Hammond, Edward; Elli, Stefano; Rudd, Timothy R; Mycroft-West, Courtney J; Lima, Marcelo A; Skidmore, Mark A; Karlsson, Richard; Chen, Yen-Hsi; Bagdonaite, Ieva; Yang, Zhang; Ahmed, Yassir A; Richard, Derek J; Turnbul, Jeremy; Ferro, Vito; Coombe, Deirdre R; Gandhi, Neha S",,,636

Study 1 used Google mobility data and nation-level personality data from 31 countries, both before and after region-specific legislative interventions, finding that agreeable nations are most consistently compliant with mobility restrictions. Study 2 (N = 105,857) replicated these findings using individual-level data, showing that several personality traits predict sheltering in place behavior, but extraverts are especially likely to remain mobile. Overall, our analyses reveal robust relationships between traits and regulatory compliance (mobility behavior), both before and after region-specific legislative interventions, and the global declaration of the pandemic. Further, we find significant effects on reasons for leaving home, as well as age and gender differences, particularly relating to female agreeableness for previous and future social mobility behaviors. These sex differences, however, are only visible for those living in households with two or more people, suggesting that such findings may be driven by division of labor.","Chan, Ho Fai; Moon, Jordan W.; Savage, David A.; Skali, Ahmed; Torgler, Benno; Whyte, Stephen",Soc.

345740,Lessons (so far) from the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic influences health care facilities world-wide. The flow rate, type, and severity of cases presented to emergency departments varied during the pandemic in comparison to the past years. However, this change has not been well-described among the cases of hospital admission due to toxic exposure. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Recognition of the pattern of toxic exposure among the cases refereed to Tanta Poison Control Center (TPCC; Tanta, Egypt) during the past five years, and furthermore, exploration of the impact of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the pattern of presented cases. METHODS: The current study is a five-year retrospective, comparative cross-sectional study carried out among acutely intoxicated patients admitted to TPCC during the spring months (March through May) of 2016-2020. A total of 1,916 patients with complete medical records were recruited. The type and manner of toxic exposure, demographic, clinical data, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The current study noted that there were delays in time from toxic exposure to emergency services during the lockdown period. This was reflected in significant lower recovery rates (884.8/1,000 population; z = -3.0) and higher death rates (49.4/1,000 population; z = 2.1) despite the marked decrease in the total number of hospital admissions in comparison to the past four years. The lockdown period showed significantly higher phosphides (z = 3.5; &#967;2 = 34.295; P <.001) and antipsychotics exposure (z = 3.6; &#967;2 = 21.494; P <.001) than the previous years. However, predominance of female exposure and intentional self-poisoning was maintained over the past five years, including the lockdown. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-associated lockdown greatly reformed the usual intoxication pattern of the cases admitted to emergency room. Also, it played a role in delaying time of hospital arrival, which was reflected as lower recovery rates and higher death rates.","Fayed, Manar M; Sharif, Asmaa F",Prehosp Disaster Med,,636
345747,Impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on surgical practice - Part 1,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed to cause the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), an essential enzyme for viral replication, is a valid target to combat SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In this work, we present a structure-based study to identify potential covalent inhibitors containing a variety of chemical warheads. The targeted Asinex Focused Covalent (AFCL) library was screened based on different reaction types and potential covalent inhibitors were identified. In addition, we screened FDA-approved protease inhibitors to find candidates to be repurposed against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. A number of compounds with significant covalent docking scores were identified. These compounds were able to establish a covalent bond (C-S) with the reactive thiol group of Cys145 and to form favorable interactions with residues lining the substrate-binding site. Moreover, paritaprevir and simeprevir from FDA-approved protease inhibitors were identified as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The mechanism and dynamic stability of binding between the identified compounds and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro were characterized by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The identified compounds are potential inhibitors worthy of further development as COVID-19 drugs. Importantly, the identified FDA-approved anti-hepatitis-C virus (HCV) drugs paritaprevir and simeprevir could be ready for clinical trials to treat infected patients and help curb COVID-19.

The Fear of COVID-19 scale is a scale that can measure anxiety related to COVID-19 in a short time. The purpose of this study was to verify the reliability and validity the Korean version of Fear of COVID-19 scale (KF-COVID-19S). METHODS: The data of total 186 normal adults and 17 patients were finally used for the statistical analysis. For internal consistency, Cronbach's &#945; was calculated. For concurrent and discriminant validity, the correlations with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS), Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment Instrument Brief Form (WHOQOLBREF) were analyzed. For construct validity, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted. RESULTS: Cronbach alpha was 0.88. The two-factor model (factor 1: Physical fear, factor 2: Emotional fear) showed significantly positive correlations and appeared to be ""good"" fitness (CFI=0.906, IFI=0.907, NFI=0.902). CONCLUSION: The KF-COVID-19S can be a useful scale that can measure the physical and emotional fears associated with COVID-19 in a short time. Because the psychiatric patients are a more vulnerable group to the fear, it is thought that the KF-COVID-19S will help to determine the patient's level of anxiety and make a therapeutic plan for the underlying mental disorder.","Hwang, Kyu-Sic; Choi, Hye-Ji; Yang, Chan-Mo; Hong, Jeongwan; Lee, Hye-Jin; Park, Min-Cheol; Jang, Seung-Ho; Lee, Sang-Yeol",,,636

In the present scenario CoVs has been transmitted to the European and American regions through the travellers from wide spread countries like China and Japan. The viral disease is spreading through the contact in any form by the infected persons or patients and creating huge risk of mortality. CoVs are a single positive-sense RNA virus; mutation rates are higher than DNA viruses and indicate a more effective survival adaption mechanism. Human CoVs can cause common cold and influenza-like illness and a variety of severe acute respiratory disease such as pneumonia. Early in infection, CoVs infects epithelial cells, macrophages, T-cells, dendritic cells and also can affect the development and implantation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. It mainly produces the melanoma differentiation associated with protein-5, retinoic acid inducible gene-1 and endosomal toll-like receptor 3. How CoVs affects the function of the immune system is still unclear due to lack of this knowledge. No Food and Drug Administration approved treatment is available till date.

As a great threat to global public health, the development of a treatment has become vital, and a rush to find a cure has mobilized researchers from all areas across the world. Synthetic drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, have gained attention. However, the efficacy of repositioned drugs is still under evaluation, and besides, some severe side effects are a cause for concern. This emphasizes the urgency for treatment options, which can be both safe and effective. With this in mind, natural products could be an important resource in the development of COVID-19 treatment, as they have already contributed in the past to treatments against other viruses, such as HIV, MERS-CoV, and influenza. Natural products are described long term as bioactive substances and some phytochemical classes such as flavonoids, alkaloids, and peptides are known antiviral bioproducts, and have been virtually tested with success against COVID-19. However, important issues still need to be addressed as to their bioavailability and true efficacy in vivo. This review intends to systematically evaluate the natural metabolites that could potentially be used against this new disease looking at their natural sources, mechanism of action and previous pharmacological usages.

347152,Does Higher Self-Reported Cardiorespiratory Fitness Reduce the Odds of Hospitalization From COVID-19?,2021,"The structure of an RNA molecule plays a significant role in its biological function. Predicting structure given a one dimensional sequence of RNA nucleotide bases is a difficult and important problem. Many computer programs (known as in silico) are available for predicting 2-dimensional (secondary) structures however 3-dimensional (tertiary) structure prediction is much more difficult mainly due to the far greater number of feasible solutions and fewer experimental data on the thermodynamic energies of 3D structures. It is also challenging to verify the most likely three dimensional structure even with the availability of sophisticated x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging technologies. In this paper we develop three dimensional RNA folding predictions by adding penalty and reward parameters to a previous two dimensional approach based on Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) models. These parameters provide flexibility in the amount of three dimensional folding allowed. We address the problem of multiple near-optimal structures via a new weighted similarity structure measure and illustrate folding pathways via progressively improving local optimal solutions. The problems are solved via a new commercial QUBO solver AlphaQUBO (Meta-Analytics, 2020) that solves problems having hundreds of thousands of binary variables.","Lewis, Mark W.; Verma, Amit; Hennig, Rick",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07527v1.pdf,636

The comparison of past pandemics will enable us to determine post-COVID-19 precautions that should be followed. Separate tables are prepared to highlight the lessons learned and measures to be taken. Both general precautions and preventive measures for pregnant women are compiled. Results: The literature shows a continuous struggle of humans with disease outbreaks, with the most adverse impact of the Spanish flu killing 20-50 million people. Precautions need to be taken including social distancing, compulsory mask-wearing, avoiding public gatherings and washing hands regularly. The lessons from earlier pandemics show that they were equally devastating, and vaccines were not available at the time of outbreaks. Vaccines developed for polio, H1N1, measles, and other viral diseases have proven to save countless lives. Living with COVID-19 and evolving the work culture of protecting oneself and protecting others also has to be adopted. Conclusions: COVID-19 has become an everyday topic of discussion throughout the world, indicating the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, deaths and recoveries. The lessons learned from past pandemics such as social distancing, wearing masks, avoiding public gatherings and adherence to guidelines, along with personal hygiene, are the key measures that must be taken in order to live with COVID-19. Precautions for the elderly and pregnant women advised by medical authorities are to be strictly adhered to. These will help in reducing COVID-19 cases and in turn will reduce the pressure on hospitals to serve those in need. India has learned lessons from the past and the present pandemic and will move towards growth through its self-reliance.","Munnoli, Prakash Mallappa; Nabapure, S; Yeshavanth, G",Z Gesundh Wiss,,636
347566,Social Distancing to Mitigate COVID-19 Risks Is Associated With COVID-19 Discriminatory Attitudes Among People Living with HIV,2020,"The molecular basis for the severity and rapid spread of the COVID-19 disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is largely unknown. ORF8 is a rapidly evolving accessory protein that has been proposed to interfere with immune responses. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 was determined at 2.04-Å resolution by X-ray crystallography. The structure reveals a â¼60-residue core similar to SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a, with the addition of two dimerization interfaces unique to SARS-CoV-2 ORF8. A covalent disulfide-linked dimer is formed through an N-terminal sequence specific to SARS-CoV-2, while a separate noncovalent interface is formed by another SARS-CoV-2-specific sequence, 73YIDI76 Together, the presence of these interfaces shows how SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 can form unique large-scale assemblies not possible for SARS-CoV, potentially mediating unique immune suppression and evasion activities.","Flower, Thomas G; Buffalo, Cosmo Z; Hooy, Richard M; Allaire, Marc; Ren, Xuefeng; Hurley, James H",Proc.

We previously observed in a retrospective cohort study, a three-fold increase in SAA paediatric intensive care (PICU) admissions between 2003 and 2013 in the Netherlands, with a significant increase during those years of numbers of children without treatment of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Objectives: To determine whether steroid-naïve children are at higher risk of PICU admission among those hospitalised for SAA. Furthermore, we included the secondary risk factors tobacco smoke exposure, allergic sensitisation, previous admissions and viral infections. Methods: A prospective, nationwide multicentre study of children with SAA (2-18â years) admitted to all Dutch PICUs and four general wards between 2016 and 2018. Potential risk factors for PICU admission were assessed using logistic regression analyses. Measurements and main results: 110 PICU and 111 general ward patients were included. The proportion of steroid-naïve children did not differ significantly between PICU and ward patients. PICU children were significantly older and more exposed to tobacco smoke, with symptoms >1â week prior to admission. Viral susceptibility was not a significant risk factor for PICU admission. Conclusions: Children with SAA admitted to a PICU were comparable to those admitted to a general ward with respect to ICS treatment prior to admission. Preventable risk factors for PICU admission were >7â days of symptoms without adjustment of therapy and exposure to tobacco smoke. Physicians who treat children with asthma must be aware of these risk factors.","Boeschoten, Shelley A; Boehmer, Annemie L; Merkus, Peter J; van Rosmalen, Joost; de Jongste, Johan C; Fraaij, Pieter L A; Molenkamp, Richard; Heisterkamp, Sabien G; van Woensel, Job B; Kapitein, Berber; Haarman, Eric G; Wösten-van Asperen, Roelie M; Kneyber, Martin C; Lemson, Joris; Hartman, Stan; van Waardenburg, Dick A; Bunker-Wiersma, Heleen E; Brouwer, Carole N; van Ewijk, Bart E; Landstra, Anneke M; Verwaal, Mariel; Vaessen-Verberne, Anja A; Hammer, Sanne; Buysse, Corinne M; de Hoog, Matthijs",ERJ open res,,636
348180,A call to action: why medical education curriculum needs to encourage young physicians to innovate,2021,"Over the past decade, rates of depression and of suicide in adolescents have been increasing (Collishaw, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 56, 2015, 370; Bor et al., The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 48, 2014, 606). At the same time, there is some evidence that rates of diagnosis and, in the US at least, referral for depression in adolescents has been declining (Libby et al., Archives of General Psychiatry, 66, 2009, 633; John et al., Psychological Medicine, 46, 2016, 3315). These worrying statistics highlight the importance of disseminating accurate information about the risks and benefits of treatments for adolescent depression, in order to combat therapeutic nihilism. Extant controversy about the best ways to treat adolescent depression, and in particular with regards to the use of antidepressants, may have contributed to these trends. More specifically, we believe that some recent, high profile publications have incorrectly interpreted the benefit to risk ratio for the use of antidepressants in adolescent depression as unfavourable (e.g. Cipriani et al., The Lancet, 388, 2016, 881). In this editorial, we review clinical trial and pharmaco-epidemiological data that supports the retention of the use of antidepressants in the management of depressed adolescents.","Dubicka, Bernadka; Brent, David",Child Adolesc Ment Health,,636

350356,Shanghai Zhongshan Experience on Digestive Endoscopic Procedures During 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"COVID-19 is a widespread and highly contagious disease in the human population. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is still a great demand for point-of-care tests for detection, epidemic prevention and epidemiological investigation, both now and after the epidemic. We present a lateral flow immunoassay kit based on a selenium nanoparticle-modified SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, which detects anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in human serum, and the results can be read by the naked eye in 10 minutes. We expressed and purified the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein in HEK293 cells, with a purity of 98.14% and a concentration of 5 mg mL-1. Selenium nanoparticles were synthesized by l-ascorbic acid reduction of seleninic acid at room temperature. After conjugation with the nucleoprotein, a lateral flow kit was successfully prepared. The IgM and IgG detection limits of the lateral flow kit reached 20 ng mL-1 and 5 ng mL-1, respectively, in human serum. A clinical study sample comprising 90 COVID-19-diagnosed patients and 263 non-infected controls was used to demonstrate a sensitivity and specificity of 93.33% and 97.34%, respectively, based on RT-PCR and clinical results. No cross-reactions with rheumatoid factor and positive serum for anti-nuclear antibodies, influenza A, and influenza B were observed. Moreover, the lateral flow kit remained stable after storage for 30 days at 37 °C. Our results demonstrate that the selenium nanoparticle lateral flow kit can conveniently, rapidly, and sensitively detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in human serum and blood; it can also be suitable for the epidemiological investigation of COVID-19.","Wang, Zhizeng; Zheng, Zhi; Hu, Hangzhan; Zhou, Qianwen; Liu, Wei; Li, Xiaoquan; Liu, Zhigang; Wang, Yaohui; Ma, Yuanfang",Lab Chip,,636
350975,A cohort analysis of patients receiving neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy prior to robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy during the Covid-19 pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the world economically and medically. Understanding and defining the biology of this specific coronavirus infection may lead to targeted therapies to lessen its virulence and expand the host resistance. This study's objective was to apply morphoproteomics to pulmonary lung sections from a forensic autopsy of an untreated COVID-19 victim, so that we may better define its biology from the perspective of its interaction with the host and provide options for therapeutic targets. DESIGN: Morphoproteomic analysis from a case study of this COVID-19 pulmonary infection included immunohistochemical probes to detect phosphorylated p-STAT3 (Tyr 705), as part of the interleukin (IL)-6 pathway; cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes, Programmed Death (PD)-1 receptor+ lymphoid cells, CD56+ NK lymphoid cells, CD163+ (M2 polarized monocytes/macrophages), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression as part of the host response to interaction with the COVID-19 virus. RESULTS: Representative sections of the COVID-19 victim's lung showed: nuclear expression of p-STAT3 (Tyr 705) in many of the alveolar pneumocytes and in occasional endothelial cells; COX-2 expression in the alveolar pneumocytes; a relative paucity of CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes; absence of CD56+ NK lymphoid cells; abundance of intra-alveolar and alveolar interstitial CD163+ macrophages/monocytes; PD-L1 expression on occasional macrophages, focally on collections of alveolar pneumocytes, and on cells in the alveolar interstitium; and rare PD-1+ lymphocytes in similar regions as CD8+ lymphocytes. CONCLUSION: Morphoproteomics and microanatomical features coincide with the etiopathogenic features of pulmonary coronavirus infection and the host response. This suggests that a targeted therapy could address the biology of COVID-19 pneumonia, enhance the host immune response and prevent its progression to a life-threatening, ventilator-dependent clinical situation.","Brown, Robert E; Wolf, Dwayne A; Hunter, Robert L; Zhao, Bihong; Buja, L Maximilian",Ann Clin Lab Sci,,636

351475,Using an online learning module to teach nursing students about food insecurity as a social determinant of health,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 outbreak spread rapidly in Italy and the lack of intensive care unit (ICU) beds soon became evident, forcing the application of noninvasive respiratory support (NRS) outside the ICU, raising concerns over staff contamination. We aimed to analyse the safety of the hospital staff and the feasibility and outcomes of NRS applied to patients outside the ICU. METHODS: In this observational study, data from 670 consecutive patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 referred to pulmonology units in nine hospitals between March 1 and May 10, 2020 were analysed. Data collected included medication, mode and usage of NRS (i.e. high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), noninvasive ventilation (NIV)), length of stay in hospital, endotracheal intubation (ETI) and deaths. RESULTS: 42 (11.1%) healthcare workers tested positive for infection, but only three of them required hospitalisation. Data are reported for all patients (69.3% male), whose mean±sd age was 68±13â years. The arterial oxygen tension/inspiratory oxygen fraction ratio at baseline was 152±79, and the majority (49.3%) of patients were treated with CPAP. The overall unadjusted 30-day mortality rate was 26.9%, with 16%, 30% and 30% for HFNC, CPAP and NIV, respectively, while the total ETI rate was 27%, with 29%, 25% and 28%, respectively; the relative probability of death was not related to the NRS used after adjustment for confounders. ETI and length of stay were not different among the groups. Mortality rate increased with age and comorbidity class progression. CONCLUSIONS: The application of NRS outside the ICU is feasible and associated with favourable outcomes. Nonetheless, it was associated with a risk of staff contamination.","Franco, Cosimo; Facciolongo, Nicola; Tonelli, Roberto; Dongilli, Roberto; Vianello, Andrea; Pisani, Lara; Scala, Raffaele; Malerba, Mario; Carlucci, Annalisa; Negri, Emanuele Alberto; Spoladore, Greta; Arcaro, Giovanna; Tillio, Paolo Amedeo; Lastoria, Cinzia; Schifino, Gioachino; Tabbì, Luca; Guidelli, Luca; Guaraldi, Giovanni; Ranieri, V Marco; Clini, Enrico; Nava, Stefano",Eur. respir. j,,636

352338,"A Perfect Storm? Health Anxiety, Contamination Fears, and COVID-19: Lessons Learned from Past Pandemics and Current Challenges",2021,"MOTIVATION: Aligning single-cell transcriptomes is important for the joint analysis of multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, which in turn is vital to establishing a holistic cellular landscape of certain biological processes. Although numbers of approaches have been proposed for this problem, most of which only consider mutual neighbors when aligning the cells without taking into account known cell type annotations. RESULTS: In this work, we present MAT2 that aligns cells in the manifold space with a deep neural network employing contrastive learning strategy. Compared with other manifold-based approaches, MAT2 has two-fold advantages. Firstly, with cell triplets defined based on known cell type annotations, the consensus manifold yielded by the alignment procedure is more robust especially for datasets with limited common cell types. Secondly, the batch-effect-free gene expression reconstructed by MAT2 can better help annotate cell types. Benchmarking results on real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that MAT2 outperforms existing popular methods. Moreover, with MAT2, the hematopoietic stem cells are found to differentiate at different paces between human and mouse.

352502,Assessment of Anxiety and Stress among Dental Students to Return to Training in Dental College in COVID-19 Era,2020,"This study focused on classifying and disposing Circulating fluidized bed (CFB) fly ashes from the level of its origin, and proposed an optimal formulation system for clinker-free cemented backfill materials. CFB fly ash-blast furnace slag (BFS)-based cemented backfill materials with unequal strength grades are used in different locations of the goaf that require more than 1 Mpa and 4 Mpa, respectively, and the leaching levels of all toxic components are lower than the underground III water quality standard limit when the additional amount of CFB fly ash does not exceed 60 wt.%. The stable S/S of Cl- is due to the combined effect of chemical fixation of HCC and physical adsorption of the C-S-H/C-A-S-H phase. B2(20 wt.% CFB fly ash) exhibits more functional hydration products and higher degree of polymerization with the hydration age extension. Ettringite is the major effective product of CFB fly ash-BFS-based cemented system due to low level of chlorine environment and HCC transformation. CFB fly ash with appropriate active Al2O3 can dissolve and promote [AlO4]5- to substitute [SiO4]4- to form the C-A-S-H phase with longer chains and higher degree of polymerization with increase in Al/Si ratio of C-A-S-H/C-S-H phase.","Zhang, Siqi; Shi, Tengyu; Ni, Wen; Li, Keqing; Gao, Wei; Wang, Ke; Zhang, Yuying",J Hazard Mater,,636
352554,Safe nasendoscopy assisted procedure in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era,2020,"The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is spreading all across the globe. By June 29, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the number of cases worldwide had reached 9 994 206 and resulted in more than 499 024 deaths. The earliest case of COVID-19 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was registered on March 2 in 2020. Since then, the number of infections as per the outcome of the tests increased gradually on a daily basis. The KSA has 182 493 cases, with 124 755 recoveries and 1551 deaths on June 29, 2020. There have been significant efforts to develop models that forecast the risks, parameters, and impacts of this epidemic. These models can aid in controlling and preventing the outbreak of these infections. In this regard, this article details the extent to which the infection cases, prevalence, and recovery rate of this pandemic are in the country and the predictions that can be made using the past and current data. The well-known classical SIR model was applied to predict the highest number of cases that may be realized and the flattening of the curve afterward. On the other hand, the ARIMA model was used to predict the prevalence cases. Results of the SIR model indicate that the repatriation plan reduced the estimated reproduction number. The results further affirm that the containment technique used by Saudi Arabia to curb the spread of the disease was efficient. Moreover, using the results, close interaction between people, despite the current measures remains a great risk factor to the spread of the disease. This may force the government to take even more stringent measures. By validating the performance of the applied models, ARIMA proved to be a good forecasting method from current data. The past data and the forecasted data, as per the ARIMA model provided high correlation, showing that there were minimum errors.","Abuhasel, Khaled Ali; Khadr, Mosaad; Alquraish, Mohammed M",Computational intelligence,,636

Para tanto, foi realizado um conjunto de simulações para estimar a demanda de leitos gerais (microrregiões de saúde), leitos de UTI e equipamentos de ventilação assistida (macrorregiões de saúde) em diferentes cenários, para intensidade (taxas de infecção equivalentes a 0,01, 0,1 e 1 caso por 100 habitantes) e horizontes temporais (1, 3 e 6 meses). Os resultados evidenciam uma situação crítica do sistema para atender essa demanda potencial, uma vez que diversas microrregiões e macrorregiões de saúde operariam além de sua capacidade, comprometendo o atendimento a pacientes principalmente aqueles com sintomas mais severos. O estudo apresenta três mensagens relevantes. Em primeiro lugar, é necessário reduzir a velocidade de propagação da COVID-19 na população brasileira, permitindo um tempo maior para a reorganização da oferta e aliviando a pressão sobre o sistema de saúde. Segundo, é necessário expandir o número de leitos disponíveis. Ainda que o setor privado contribua para amortecer o déficit de demanda, a oferta conjunta dos dois setores não seria suficiente em várias macrorregiões. A construção de hospitais de campanha é importante, tanto em locais onde historicamente há vazios assistenciais como também naqueles onde já se observa uma pressão do lado da demanda. A terceira mensagem diz respeito à organização regionalizada dos serviços de saúde que, apesar de adequada em situações de demanda usual, em momentos de pandemia este desenho implica desafios adicionais, especialmente se a distância que o paciente tiver de percorrer for muito grande.","Noronha, Kenya Valeria Micaela de Souza; Guedes, Gilvan Ramalho; Turra, Cássio Maldonado; Andrade, Mônica Viegas; Botega, Laura; Nogueira, Daniel; Calazans, Julia Almeida; Carvalho, Lucas; Servo, Luciana; Ferreira, Monique Félix",Cad.

We identified the curricular components of an internal medicine (IM) clerkship that would be compromised if students learned solely from online didactics, case studies, and simulations (i.e., prerounding, oral presentations, diagnostic reasoning, and medical management discussions). Using these guiding principles, we created a virtual rounds (VR) curriculum to provide IM clerkship students with clinical exposure during a virtual learning period. Methods: Held three times a week for 2 weeks, VR consisted of three curricular components. First, clerkship students prerounded on an assigned hospitalized patient by remotely accessing the electronic health record and calling into hospital rounds. Second, each student prepared an oral presentation on their assigned patient. Third, using videoconferencing, students delivered these oral presentations to telemedicine VR small groups consisting of three to four students and three tele-instructors. Tele-instructors then provided feedback on oral presentations and taught clinical concepts. We assessed the effectiveness of VR by anonymously surveying students and tele-instructors. Results: Twenty-nine students and 34 volunteer tele-instructors participated in VR over four blocks. A majority of students felt VR improved their prerounding abilities (86%), oral presentation abilities (93%), and clinical reasoning skills (62%). All students found small group to be useful. Discussion: VR allowed students to practice rounding skills in a supportive team-based setting. The lessons learned from its implementation could facilitate education during future pandemics and could also supplement in-person clerkship education.","Sukumar, Smrithi; Zakaria, Adam; Lai, Cindy J; Sakumoto, Matthew; Khanna, Raman; Choi, Nancy",MedEdPORTAL,,636
354236,The Polish Society of Gynecologists and Obstetricians statement on surgery in gynecology during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel viral illness originating out of Wuhan China in late 2019. This global pandemic has infected nearly 3 million people and accounted for 200 000 deaths worldwide, with those numbers still climbing. Case summary: We present a 54-year-old patient who developed respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation from her infection with SARS-CoV-2. This patient was subsequently found to have a right ventricular thrombus and bilateral pulmonary emboli, likely contributing to her respiratory status. On the 14th day of hospitalization, the patient was successfully extubated, and 5 days later was discharged to the rehabilitation unit. Discussion: SARS-CoV-2 presents primarily with pulmonary symptoms; however, many patients, particularly those who are severely ill, exhibit adverse events related to hypercoagulability. The exact mechanism explaining this hypercoagulable state has yet to be elucidated, but these thrombotic events have been linked to the increased inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2. This novel viral illness is still largely misunderstood, but the hypercoagulable state, seen in severely ill patients, appears to play a major role in disease progression and prognosis.","Kaplan, Jason G; Kanwal, Arjun; Malek, Ryan; Dickey, John Q; Keirn, Richard; Zweig, Bryan; Minter, David",Eur Heart J Case Rep,,636

The objectives are to study the clinical features of COVID-19 patients and assess the relationship between the severity of COVID-19, age, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The retrospective data of 134 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in 3 hospitals of Xiaogan City, between February 1 and March 1, 2020, was collected. This study documented COVID-19 patients. Clinical data in terms of body temperature, history of travel, and direct contact with COVID-19 patients, and incubation period was collected. Out of the 134 patients, only 5 required intensive care. Moreover, 2 patients succumbed during this period. The median age of patients was 45 (33-56) years. The most common symptoms at the onset of disease were fever (66.4%), cough (33, 6%), and sore throat (14.7%). Amongst the medicines used, antiviral agents (92.3%) followed by the traditional Chinese medicine (89.5%) were most commonly used. In both the crude and adjusted (I to III) models, odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval for both age and CRP levels were > 1. Moreover, the smooth curve fitting graph reflected that the severity of COVID-19 was positively correlated with both age and CRP levels (all P value < 0.05). The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 patients were fairly moderate. The health care professionals treating the COVID-19 patients should be aware of the increased likelihood of progression to severe COVID-19 in elderly patients and those with high CRP levels.","Feng, Gong; Huang, Wan-Qiang; Liu, Man-Ling; Lin, Si-Ceng; Zhang, Xiao-Zhou; Zhang, Yan; He, Xiao-Qing; Liu, Jun-Lin; Chen, Zi-Jun; Guo, Zi-Kai; Gao, Jie; Yao, Cheng-Zi; He, Na; Yan, Qin-Qin; Mi, Man",SN Compr Clin Med,,636

Respiratory viruses such as the influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) typically infect the upper respiratory tract by entry through the respiratory mucosa before reaching the lower respiratory tract, resulting in respiratory disease. Generally, vaccination is the primary method in preventing virus pathogenicity and it has been shown to remarkably reduce the burden of various infectious diseases. Nevertheless, the efficacy of conventional vaccines may be hindered by certain limitations, prompting the need to develop novel vaccine delivery vehicles to immunize against various strains of respiratory viruses and to mitigate the risk of a pandemic. In this review, we provide an insight into how polymer-based nanoparticles can be integrated with the development of vaccines to effectively enhance immune responses for combating viral respiratory tract infections.","Chan, Yinghan; Ng, Sin Wi; Singh, Sachin Kumar; Gulati, Monica; Gupta, Gaurav; Chaudhary, Sushil Kumar; Hing, Goh Bey; Collet, Trudi; MacLoughlin, Ronan; Löbenberg, Raimar; Oliver, Brian G; Chellappan, Dinesh Kumar; Dua, Kamal",Life Sci,,636

Cumulative results show that macrophages contribute to the development and progression of acute or chronic inflammatory responses through the secretion of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and the activation of transcription factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung diseases, such as acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ARDS related to COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)), allergic asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This review summarizes the functions of macrophages and their associated underlying mechanisms in the development of ALI, ARDS, COVID-19-related ARDS, allergic asthma, COPD, and IPF and briefly introduces the acute and chronic experimental animal models. Thus, this review suggests an effective therapeutic approach that focuses on the regulation of macrophage function in the context of inflammatory lung diseases.","Lee, Jae-Won; Chun, Wanjoo; Lee, Hee Jae; Min, Jae-Hong; Kim, Seong-Man; Seo, Ji-Yun; Ahn, Kyung-Seop; Oh, Sei-Ryang",,,636

Also, there is often a critical interest in \textit{online} versions of such factorization algorithms to learn progressively from minibatches, without requiring the full data as in conventional algorithms. However, the current theory of Online NTF algorithms is quite nascent, especially compared to the comprehensive literature on online NMF algorithms. In this work, we introduce a novel online NTF algorithm that learns a CP basis from a given stream of tensor-valued data under general constraints. In particular, using nonnegativity constraints, the learned CP modes also give localized dictionary atoms that respect the tensor structure in multi-model data. On the application side, we demonstrate the utility of our algorithm on a diverse set of examples from image, video, and time series data, illustrating how one may learn qualitatively different CP-dictionaries by not needing to reshape tensor data before the learning process. On the theoretical side, we prove that our algorithm converges to the set of stationary points of the objective function under the hypothesis that the sequence of data tensors have functional Markovian dependence. This assumption covers a wide range of application contexts including data streams generated by independent or MCMC sampling.","Strohmeier, Christopher; Lyu, Hanbaek; Needell, Deanna",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07612v1.pdf,636

Although thrombosis likely results from inflammatory activation of vascular cells, the mediators of thrombosis remain unconfirmed. In a cross-sectional cohort of 36 severe COVID-19 patients, we show that markedly increased plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels were accompanied by a partial reduction in the VWF regulatory protease ADAMTS13. In all patients we find this VWF/ADAMTS13 imbalance to be associated with persistence of ultra-high-molecular-weight (UHMW) VWF multimers that are highly thrombogenic in some disease settings. Incubation of plasma samples from patients with severe COVID-19 with recombinant ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13) substantially reduced the abnormally high VWF activity, reduced overall multimer size and depleted UHMW VWF multimers in a time and concentration dependent manner. Our data implicate disruption of normal VWF/ADAMTS13 homeostasis in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and indicate that this can be reversed ex vivo by correction of low plasma ADAMTS13 levels. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for rADAMTS13 in helping restore haemostatic balance in COVID-19 patients.","Turecek, Peter L; Peck, Rachel C; Rangarajan, Savita; Reilly-Stitt, Christopher; Laffan, Michael A; Kazmi, Rashid; James, Izabela; Dushianthan, Ahilanandan; Schrenk, Gerald; Gritsch, Herbert; Ewenstein, Bruce M; Mellgard, Bjorn; Erdlenbruch, Wolfhard; Jain, Nisha; Binder, Nikolaus B; Mumford, Andrew D",Thromb Res,,636

Focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) occupies a ""Goldilocks zone"" in vEM: iterative and automated cycles of milling and imaging allow the interrogation of microns-thick specimens in 3-D at resolutions of tens of nanometers or less. This bestows on FIB-SEM the unique ability to aid the accurate and precise study of architectures of virus-cell interactions. Here we give the virologist or cell biologist a primer on FIB-SEM imaging in the context of vEM and discuss practical aspects of a room temperature FIB-SEM experiment. In an in vitro study of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we show that accurate quantitation of viral densities and surface curvatures enabled by FIB-SEM imaging reveals SARS-CoV-2 viruses preferentially located at areas of plasma membrane that have positive mean curvatures.","Baena, Valentina; Conrad, Ryan; Friday, Patrick; Fitzgerald, Ella; Kim, Taeeun; Bernbaum, John; Berensmann, Heather; Harned, Adam; Nagashima, Kunio; Narayan, Kedar",Viruses,,636

The recent introduction of vaccines has provided a reason for hope, but new problems, such as vaccine hesitancy, have arisen. One of the most important of these issues is the safety of vaccines for pregnant women. In this article, we collected worldwide indications for vaccination, including women who are pregnant or who wish to become pregnant, and reports of adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccination. The Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Japanese Society of Infectious Diseases in Obstetrics and Gynecology have published recommendations for the vaccination of pregnant women with a COVID-19 vaccine. The guidelines are as follows: (1) pregnant women should not be excluded from vaccination; (2) informed consent should be obtained before vaccination; (3) healthcare workers and pregnant women with complications such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity should be vaccinated preferentially; (4) vaccination should be avoided until 12 weeks of gestation during organogenesis; (5) spouse and family members should be vaccinated actively; and (6) nursing mothers are not particularly affected. This policy has been adopted in government guidelines. Additional efforts should be made to protect pregnant women from infection and severe illness with COVID-19 by eliminating vaccine hesitancy.","Hayakawa, Satoshi; Komine-Aizawa, Shihoko; Takada, Kazuhide; Kimura, Tadashi; Yamada, Hideto",J. obstet. gynaecol. res,,636

Recently, the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence of band topology has been extended to higher-order cases that enable explorations of topological states with codimensions larger than one such as hinge and corner states. Here, we demonstrate a higher-order quantum spin Hall effect in a two-dimensional photonic crystal. Owing to the non-trivial higher-order topology and the pseudospin-pseudospin coupling, we observe a directional localization of photons at corners with opposite pseudospin polarizations through pseudospin-momentum-locked edge waves, resembling the quantum spin Hall effect in a higher-order manner. Our work inspires an unprecedented route to transport and trap spinful waves, supporting potential applications in topological photonic devices such as spinful topological lasers and chiral quantum emitters.","Xie, Biye; Su, Guangxu; Wang, Hong-Fei; Liu, Feng; Hu, Lumang; Yu, Si-Yuan; Zhan, Peng; Lu, Ming-Hui; Wang, Zhenlin; Chen, Yan-Feng",Nat Commun,,636

Understanding these perturbations will assist in designing better therapeutics to combat viral infection. System-based proteomic assays now provide unprecedented opportunity to monitor large numbers of cellular proteins. AREAS COVERED: This review will describe various quantitative and functional mass spectrometry-based methods, and complementary non-mass spectrometry-based methods, such as aptamer profiling and proximity extension assays, and examples of how each are used to delineate how viruses affect host cells, identify which viral proteins interact with which cellular proteins, and how these change during the course of a viral infection. PubMed was searched multiple times prior to manuscript submissions and revisions, using virus, viral, proteomics; in combination with each keyword. The most recent examples of published works from each search were then analyzed. EXPERT OPINION: There has been exponential growth in numbers and types of proteomic analyses in recent years. Continued development of reagents that allow increased multiplexing and deeper proteomic probing of the cell, at quantitative and functional levels, enhancements that target more important protein modifications, and improved bioinformatics software tools and pathway prediction algorithms will accelerate this growth and usher in a new era of host proteome understanding.","Coombs, Kevin M",Expert Rev Proteomics,,636

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data retrospectively of 180 cases of COVID-19, from 15 January 2020 to 31 March 2020, from both the Wuhan Zhongnan and Beijing Ditan Hospitals, including 103 cases of mild and 77 cases of severe pneumonia. All patients had their first chest computed tomography scan within five days of symptom onset. The dandelion sign was defined by a focal ground glass opacity (GGO) with a central thickening of the airway wall, and the focal crazy paving sign was defined by a focal GGO with thickening of the interlobular septa. RESULTS: Consolidation presented in only 4.9% (5/103) of the mild pneumonia cases, which was significantly lower than that in severe pneumonia cases (70.1% 54/77), p < .001). Multifocal distribution and pure GGOs were observed more frequently in severe cases of pneumonia (p < .05). The dandelion sign was present in 86.4% (89/103) of the mild pneumonia cases, significantly more frequent than those with severe pneumonia (13.0% [10/77], p < .001). The focal crazy paving sign presented in 65.0% (67/103) of the mild pneumonia cases and was significantly more frequent than in severe cases (23.4% [18/77], p < .001). The hospital stay duration of the mild pneumonia group (13.6 ± 7.2 days) was significantly shorter than the severe pneumonia group (26.6 ± 11.7 days, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Consolidation, pure GGO and multifocal distribution on a CT scan were associated with severe COVID-19. The dandelion and focal crazy paving signs indicate mild COVID-19.","Zhan, Xi; Chen, Zhihai; Hu, Huijuan; Yang, Yibin; Wu, Kaisong; Cheng, Zhenshun; Liu, Bing",Curr Med Res Opin,,636

As such, the identification of inhibitory drugs against its etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2, is of utmost importance, and in particular, repurposing may provide the fastest route to curb the disease. As the first step in this route, we sought to identify an attractive and viable target in the virus for pharmaceutical inhibition. Using three bacteria-based assays that were tested on known viroporins, we demonstrate that one of its essential components, the E protein, is a potential ion channel and, therefore, is an excellent drug target. Channel activity was demonstrated for E proteins in other coronaviruses, providing further emphasis on the importance of this functionally to the virus' pathogenicity. The results of a screening effort involving a repurposing drug library of ion channel blockers yielded two compounds that inhibit the E protein: Gliclazide and Memantine. In conclusion, as a route to curb viral virulence and abate COVID-19, we point to the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 as an attractive drug target and identify off-label compounds that inhibit it.","Singh Tomar, Prabhat Pratap; Arkin, Isaiah T",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,636

363601,Compliance with Feeding Guidelines in COVID+ Patients,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has lead to a worldwide effort to characterize its evolution through the mapping of mutations in the genome of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Ideally, one would like to quickly identify new mutations that could confer adaptive advantages (e.g. higher infectivity or immune evasion) by leveraging the large number of genomes. One way of identifying adaptive mutations is by looking at convergent mutations, mutations in the same genomic position that occur independently. However, the large number of currently available genomes precludes the efficient use of phylogeny-based techniques. Here, we establish a fast and scalable Topological Data Analysis approach for the early warning and surveillance of emerging adaptive mutations based on persistent homology. It identifies convergent events merely by their topological footprint and thus overcomes limitations of current phylogenetic inference techniques. This allows for an unbiased and rapid analysis of large viral datasets. We introduce a new topological measure for convergent evolution and apply it to the GISAID dataset as of February 2021, comprising 303,651 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected since the beginning of the pandemic. We find that topologically salient mutations on the receptor-binding domain appear in several variants of concern and are linked with an increase in infectivity and immune escape, and for many adaptive mutations the topological signal precedes an increase in prevalence. We show that our method effectively identifies emerging adaptive mutations at an early stage. By localizing topological signals in the dataset, we extract geo-temporal information about the early occurrence of emerging adaptive mutations. The identification of these mutations can help to develop an alert system to monitor mutations of concern and guide experimentalists to focus the study of specific circulating variants.","Bleher, Michael; Hahn, Lukas; Patino-Galindo, Juan Angel; Carriere, Mathieu; Bauer, Ulrich; Rabadan, Raul; Ott, Andreas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07292v1.pdf,636

A natural experiment,2021,"To put estimates of COVID-19 mortality into perspective, we estimate age-specific mortality for an epidemic claiming for illustrative purposes 1 million US lives, with results approximately scalable over a broad range of deaths. We calculate the impact on period life expectancy (down 2.94 y) and remaining life years (11.7 y per death). Avoiding 1.75 million deaths or 20.5 trillion person years of life lost would be valued at $10.2 to $17.5 trillion. The age patterns of COVID-19 mortality in other countries are quite similar and increase at rates close to each country's rate for all-cause mortality. The scenario of 1 million COVID-19 deaths is similar in scale to that of the decades-long HIV/AIDS and opioid-overdose epidemics but considerably smaller than that of the Spanish flu of 1918. Unlike HIV/AIDS and opioid epidemics, the COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in a period of months rather than spread out over decades.","Goldstein, Joshua R; Lee, Ronald D",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,636

Using this portable toolbox on site, we successfully characterized the microbiome of water samples collected from Birtley Sewage Treatment Plant, UK, and its environs. We also demonstrated the applicability of the portable metagenomics toolbox in a low-income country by surveying water samples from the Akaki River around Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing workflow, including DNA extraction, PCR amplification, sequencing library preparation, and sequencing was accomplished within one working day. The metagenomic data became available within 24-72 h, depending on internet speed. Metagenomic analysis clearly distinguished the microbiome of pristine samples from sewage influenced water samples. Metagenomic analysis identified the potential role of two bacterial genera not conventionally monitored, Arcobacter and Aeromonas, as predominant faecal pollution indicators/waterborne hazards. Subsequent quantitative PCR analysis validated the high Arcobacter butzleri abundances observed in the urban influenced Akaki River water samples by portable next generation sequencing with the MinION device. Overall, our field deployable metagenomics toolbox advances the capability of scientists to comprehensively monitor microbiomes anywhere in the world, including in the water, food and drinks industries, the health services, agriculture and beyond.","Acharya, Kishor; Blackburn, Adrian; Mohammed, Jemila; Haile, Alemseged Tamiru; Hiruy, Andualem Mekonnen; Werner, David",Water Res,,636

In this paper, we tackle these questions through an investigation of the factors that drove Latino turnout in 2020 and what might explain Latino favorability for Joe Biden and Donald Trump To contextualize these findings, we compare these results to the 2016 election We find that the most predictive factors of Latino turnout in 2020 were perceived group discrimination and mobilization efforts by campaigns and other organizations We also find that Latino candidate preference in 2020 can be best explained by issue prioritization Latinos for whom the economy was the most important issue were more likely to support Donald Trump However, Latinos for whom COVID-19 and racism towards the Latino community were the top pressing political priorities were more likely to favor Joe Biden These findings continue to shed light on the diversity and heterogeneity of the Latino vote and speak to the significance of outreach efforts by political parties, candidates and community organizations [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Forum (2194-6183) is the property of De Gruyter and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","Ocampo, Angela X.; Garcia-Rios, Sergio I.; Gutierrez, Angela E.",Forum (2194-6183),,636

Due to its unique characteristics of being water soluble, biocompatible, biodegradable, and non-toxic, this macromolecule is highly attractive for a broad range of applications. In addition, its complex behavior and the number of ways it interacts with different components in a system result in an astonishing variety of chitosan-based materials. Herein, we present recent advances in the field of chitosan-based materials from a physico-chemical perspective, with focus on aqueous mixtures with oppositely charged colloids, chitosan-based thin films, and nanocomposite systems. In this review, we focus our attention on the physico-chemical properties of chitosan-based materials, including solubility, mechanical resistance, barrier properties, and thermal behaviour, and provide a link to the chemical peculiarities of chitosan, such as its intrinsic low solubility, high rigidity, large charge separation, and strong tendency to form intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds.","Cavallaro, Giuseppe; Micciulla, Samantha; Chiappisi, Leonardo; Lazzara, Giuseppe",,,636

(COVID-19 special issue.),2020,"With more than three billion people in isolation, the status of digital spaces is switching from an amenity to a necessity, as they become not only the main way to access information and services, but also one of the only remaining vectors for economic, educational, and leisure activities as well as for social interactions to take place. However, not all are equals in terms of access to networks or connected devices, or when it comes to the skills required to navigate computerized spaces optimally. Digital inequalities were already existing, yet the COVID-19 crisis is exacerbating them dramatically. On the one hand, the crisis will worsen digital inequalities within the population. On the other hand, digital inequalities represent a major risk factor of vulnerability for exposure to the virus itself, and for the non-sanitary consequences of the crisis. Therefore, this paper aims at exploring the reciprocal impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and digital inequalities, and to propose operative solutions to help fight the nefarious consequences of the crisis. We first describe how digital inequalities are a determinant of health. We then investigate how COVID-19 can potentiate digital inequalities, and how digital inequalities potentiate vulnerability to COVID-19. Finally, in order to contribute to the mitigation of this crisis, we propose a set of multi-layered strategies focusing on actionability that can be implemented at multiple structural levels, ranging from governmental to corporate and community levels.","Beaunoyer, Elisabeth; Dupéré, Sophie; Guitton, Matthieu J",Comput Human Behav,,636

Upcoming evidence from confirmed cases of COVID-19 suggests an anticipated incursion of patients with neurological manifestations in the weeks to come. An expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2), the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 over the glial cells and neurons have made the brain a potential target. Neurotoxicity may occur as a result of direct, indirect and post-infectious complications. Attention to neurological deficits in COVID-19 is fundamental to ensure appropriate, timely, beneficial management of the affected patients. Most common neurological manifestations seen include dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, and seizures. Anosmia and ageusia have recently been hinted as significant early symptoms in COVID-19.

Furthermore, these populations typically lack proper sanitation and hygiene conditions, which are requirements to adequately control the outbreak. This paper proposes the use of System Dynamics modeling to support the public policy-making process in order to avert negative effects of the pandemic in the Brazilian favelas based on measures elicited from the social movement named ""Favelas Contra o Corona."" The simulation model assessed the effectiveness of strategies and policy bundles encompassing temporary transfer of the favela population, supply of hygiene products, emergency sanitation structures, and expansion of Intensive Care Units. Results indicate that a suitable combination of strategies can bring significant effects to the number of avoidable deaths and the availability of Intensive Care Units for the population.","Rodrigues, Vinícius Picanço; Oliveira, Igor Czermainski de; Chaves, Gisele de Lorena Diniz; Aquino, Ellen Larissa de Carvalho; Viegas, Cláudia Viviane",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,636

A major way this has been accomplished is through the regular assessment of wastewater samples by qRT-PCR to detect the prevalence of viral nucleic acid with respect to time and location. Further expansion of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring efforts to include the detection of variants of interest / concern through next-generation sequencing have enhanced the understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. In this report we detail the results of a collaborative effort between public health and metropolitan wastewater management authorities and the University of Louisville to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic through the monitoring of aggregate wastewater samples over a period of 28 weeks. Our data indicates that wastewater monitoring of water quality treatment centers and smaller neighborhood-scale catchment areas is a viable means by which the prevalence and genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2 within a metropolitan community of approximately one million individuals may be monitored. Importantly, these efforts confirm that regional emergence and spread of variants of interest / concern may be detected as readily in aggregate wastewater samples as compared to the individual wastewater sheds.","Rouchka, Eric Christian; Chariker, Julia H.; Saurabh, Kumar; Waigel, Sabine; Zacharias, Wolfgang; Zhang, Mei; Talley, Daymond; Santisteban, Ian; Puccio, Madeline; Moyer, Sarah; Holm, Rochelle; Yeager, Ray; Sokoloski, Kevin J; Fuqua, Joshua; Bhatnagar, Aruni; Smith, Ted",,,636

This paper aims to assess and characterise SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg to identify groups at greatest risk, to establish early measures to curb transmission. We analysed all mandatory notified (i.e. laboratory-confirmed) coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks with more than two cases in Baden-Wuerttemberg from calendar weeks 18-49 (from 27 April to 6 December 2020). We used the following classification for settings: asylum and refugee accommodation, care homes, care facilities, day care child centres, hobby-related, hospitality, hospitals, households, other, residence halls, schools, supported housing, training schools, transportation, treatment facilities and workplace (occupational). We used R program version 3.6.3 for analysis. In our analysis, 3219 outbreaks with 22 238 individuals were included. About 48% were in household and hobby-related settings. Care homes accounted for 9.5% of outbreaks and 21.6% of cases. The median age across all settings was 43 (interquartile range (IQR) 24-63). The median age of cases in care homes was 81 (IQR 56-88). Of all reported cases in care homes, 72.1% were women. Over 30% (466/1511) of hospitalisations were among cases in care homes compared to 17.7% (268/1511) in households. Overall, 70% (500/715) of all deceased persons in outbreaks in the study period were in care homes compared to 4.2% in household settings (30/715). We observed an exponential increase in the number of notified outbreaks starting around the 41st week with N = 291 outbreaks reported in week 49. The median number of cases in outbreaks in care homes and care facilities after the 40th week was 14 (IQR 5-29) and 11 (IQR 5-20), respectively, compared to 3 (IQR 3-5) in households. We observed an increase in hospitalisations, and mortality associated with COVID-19 outbreaks in care homes after the 40th week. We found the care home demographic to be at greatest risk after the 40th week, based on the exponential increase in outbreaks, the number of cases, hospitalisations and mortality trends. Our analysis highlights the necessity of targeted, setting-specific approaches to control transmission in this vulnerable population. Regular screening of staff members and visitors' using rapid antigen point-of-care-tests could be a game-changer in curbing transmission in this setting.","Dressler, Aparna; Finci, Iris; Wagner-Wiening, Christiane; Eichner, Martin; Brockmann, Stefan O",Epidemiol Infect,,636

The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 pose a series of challenges both in understanding and delimiting the disease secondary to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is due to the fact that the main axis of this disease is the endothelial compromise and the production of a ""cytokine storm,"" triggering multiple organ failure and death. Given that a complete understanding of its pathophysiology and clinical behavior has not yet been achieved, we wondered if coinfection with other respiratory viruses modifies its performance and outcomes described so far. A literature search was performed, obtaining 68 articles, of which 25 were analyzed. The analysis showed us that there is a high variety both in the types of associated infections and in the clinical behavior of patients and their outcomes. Therefore, we consider that the search for other infections should be performed exhaustively, especially in those cases that may be susceptible to treatment such as Influenza A, human immunodeficiency virus, or bacterial infections. As well as optimize the analysis of these cases and establish if there are characteristics that allow establishing the possibility of carrying an additional infection to that of SARS-CoV-2 and the implications for the management and prognosis of the patient.","Barrera-López, Pedro; Pérez-Riveros, Erika D; Moreno-Montoya, José; Ballesteros, Silvia Marcela; Valencia, Sergio A; De la Hoz-Valle, José A",J. med. virol,,636
368589,Predicting mask-wearing behavior intention among international students during COVID-19 based on the theory of planned behavior,2021,"BACKGROUND: Currently, the novel coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic poses the greatest global health threat worldwide, and India is no exception. As an overpopulated developing country, it is very difficult to maintain social distancing to restrict the spread of the disease in India. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to examine India's interstate performances to combat COVID-19. This study aims to explore twin objectives: to investigate the comparative efficiency of Indian states to combat COVID-19 and to unfold the factors responsible for interstate disparities in the efficiency in combatting COVID-19. METHODS: The stochastic production frontier model was utilized for data analysis. The empirical analysis was facilitated by the inefficiency effects model, revealing the factors that influence interstate variability in disease management efficiency. Three types of variables, namely, output, inputs, and exogenous, were used to measure health system efficiency. The relevant variables were compiled from secondary sources. The recovery rate from COVID-19 was the output variable and health infrastructures were considered as the input variable. On the contrary, the non-health determinants considered to have a strong influence on the efficiency of states' disease management, but could not be considered as input variables, were recognised as exogenous variables. These exogenous variables were specifically used for the inefficiency analysis. RESULTS: The empirical results demonstrated the existence of disparities across Indian states in the level of efficiency in combatting COVID-19. A non-trivial outcome of this study was that Tamil Nadu was the best performer and Manipur was the worst performer of the investigated states. Variables such as elderly people, sex ratio, literacy rate, population density, influenced the efficiency of states, and thus, affected the recovery rate. CONCLUSION: This study argues for the efficient utilisation of the existing health infrastructures in India. Simultaneously, the study suggests improving the health infrastructure to achieve a long-run benefit.","Maity, Shrabanti; Ghosh, Nandini; Barlaskar, Ummey Rummana",BMC Public Health,,636

DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: University Hospital. PATIENT: Few days after the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, a 21-year-old woman experienced massive thrombosis in the deep and superficial cerebral veins together with seizures, neurologic focal deficit, and thrombocytopenia. In the neurointensive care unit, her condition worsened despite early decompressive craniectomy. She developed bilateral segmental pulmonary embolism, left hepatic, and left external iliac venous thrombosis. INTERVENTION: Argatroban (0.5-2.2 µg/kg/min) and high-dose IV immunoglobulin (1 g/kg/d for 2 consecutive days) were initiated on day 6 after admission. With these therapies, there was a gradual resolution of multiple sites of venous thrombosis, and platelet count returned to normal. The patient left the ICU with full consciousness, expressive aphasia, and right hemiparesis. CONCLUSIONS: This case of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia shows that a good outcome can be obtained even with multiple and life-threatening venous thrombotic lesions.

It is an enveloped virus with positive-sense single-stranded RNA. Patients with COVID-19 are usually present with symptoms of fever, dry cough, myalgia, dysgeusia, nausea, diarrhoea, hyposmia and later it progresses into pneumonia. Dentists are at potential risk because they are in consistent exposure of blood and saliva, so they should have knowledge of COVID-19 infection, transmission & prevention for proper infection control practices. Aims and Objectives: The aim of the study is to assess the knowledge and perception of DHPs toward COVID-19. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was undertaken among practicing dental professionals in Lucknow city (U.P) India. A total of 302 Dental Health Practitioners (DHPs) participated in the study. Knowledge was assessed using self-administered, structured questionnaire. The questions were administered online through Google Forms by sending link to the registered Dentist through E-mail. Results: A total of 350 DHPs were participated in the study, among which 302 DHPs has given complete responses and was included in the analysis. Simple linear regression showed a significant relationship between knowledge with age of dentist (p < 0.001), qualification as MDS (p = 0.025), practice as private (p < 0.001), experience between 5 and 10 years (p = 0.009), and experienced more than 10 years(p = 0.006). Correct answers in each sections of questionnaire were defined an internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach`s alpha. Conclusion: Despite having high standard of knowledge, practices and perceptions DHPs around the world are in a state of anxiety and fear while working in their respective field due to COVID-19 impact. DHPs are advised to follow the guidelines for clinical recommendations given by health authorities like WHO, CDC, ADA and IDA.","Arif, Khushboo; Malhotra, Sitanshu; Mohammad, Shadab; Farooqui, Sana; Harayan, Manu; Singh, Pallavi; Saleem, Mohd",J Maxillofac Oral Surg,,636
369213,Fireside Chats: A Novel Wellness Initiative for Medical Students in the COVID-19 Era,2021,"Primary care coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinics were rapidly introduced across the UK to review potentially infectious patients. Evaluation of these services is needed to guide future implementation. This mixed-methods study evaluates patient demographics, clinical presentation, co-morbidities, service usage, and outcomes for the Islington COVID-19 service (London, UK) and from April to May 2020 and thematically analyses survey responses from 29 service clinicians and 41 GP referrers on their service experience. Of the 237 patients booked into the service, a significant number of referrals (n = 91; 38.6%) were made after the presumed infectious period of 14 days. Almost half of all adult referrals (49%) were dealt with remotely (via telephone/video consultation +/- remote oxygen saturation monitoring). The service was perceived to provide a safe way to see patients; it developed local expertise, learning, and empowerment; and it was a positive teamworking experience. These findings suggest that the management of many patients with COVID-19 symptoms is possible in routine general practice with minimal risk through the implementation of remote consultation methods and in patients who present after the post-infectious period. Additionally, the use of remote saturation monitoring and local GP COVID-19 ""experts"" can support practices to manage COVID-19 patients. Future primary care COVID-19 services should act as empowerment tools to assist GPs to safely manage their own patients and provide support for GPs in this process.","Hibberd, James; Carter, Jessica; McCoy, Michaella; Rafiq, Meena; Varma, Amita; Sanghera, Rita; Matthews, Philippa; Rait, Greta",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,636

369883,Effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on human sleep and rest-activity rhythms,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is characterized by a rapid change in the patient's condition, with major changes occurring over a few days. We aimed to develop and evaluate an emergency system for monitoring patients with COVID-19, which may be useful in hospitals where more severe patients stay in their homes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The system consists of the home-based patient unit, which is set up around the patient and the hospital unit, which enables the medical staff to telemonitor the patient's condition and help to send medical recommendations. The home unit allows the data transmission from the patient to the hospital, which is performed using a cell phone application. The hospital unit includes a virtual instrument developed in LabVIEW® environment that can provide a real-time monitoring of the oxygen saturation (SpO2), beats per minute (BPM), body temperature (BT), and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Abnormal events may be fast and automatically identified. After the design details are described, the system is validated by a 30-day home monitoring study in 12 controls and 12 patients with COVID-19 presenting asymptomatic to mild disease. Patients presented reduced SpO2 (p<0.0001) and increased BPM values (p<0.0001). Three patients (25%) presented PEF values between 50 and 80% of the predicted. Three of the 12 monitored patients presented events of desaturation (SpO2<92%). The experimental results were in close agreement with the involved pathophysiology, providing clear evidence that the proposed system can be a useful tool for the remote monitoring of patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: An emergency system for home monitoring of patients with COVID-19 was developed in the current study. The proposed system allowed us to quickly respond to early abnormalities in these patients. This system may contribute to conserving hospital resources for those most in need while simultaneously enabling early recognition of patients under acute deterioration, requiring urgent assessment.","Motta, Leonardo Pereira; Silva, Pedro Paulo Ferreira da; Borguezan, Bruno Max; Amaral, Jorge Luis Machado do; Milagres, Lucimar Gonçalves; Bóia, Márcio Neves; Ferraz, Marcos Rochedo; Mogami, Roberto; Nunes, Rodolfo Acatauassú; Melo, Pedro Lopes de",PLoS One,,636

We emphasise the need to be aware of the potential risk of transfusion reactions and disease worsening with convalescent plasma administration and to weigh the risk and benefits of this therapy before administration to patients and propose that further study be done regarding the potential risks of convalescent plasma.","Wang, Kevin Y; Shah, Pratik; Pierce, Matthew",BMJ case reports,,636

To gain a better understanding of the rising occupational uncertainty during this critical time, based on the job demands-resources (JD-R) theory, we examined the associations of employees' job crafting behaviors (JCB) with their occupational satisfaction and innovation workplace behavior (IWB), as well as the mediating effect of work engagement on the above relationships. The final usable data were obtained from the formal survey of 311 employees of six manufacturing companies that have returned to work amid COVID-19. Structural equation modelling was adopted to analyze the data. Results show that employees' JCB strengthens their occupational satisfaction and IWB via work engagement. Theoretically, our research enriches the existing body of knowledge about JCB from a cross-disciplinary angle integrating the perspectives of career and psychology. Practically, we offer valuable first-hand evidence about how manufacturing employees conducted JCB to re-orient their careers and to innovate in the face of the high unemployment situation.","Ren, TianZhou Cao LeLe Chin TaChia",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,636

More than half a year have passed since the first discovery of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), no effective treatment has been established especially in intensive care unit. Inflammatory cytokine storm caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported to play a central role in COVID-19; therefore, treatments for suppressing cytokines, including extracorporeal treatments, are considered to be beneficial. However, until today the efficacy of removing cytokines by extracorporeal treatments in patients with COVID-19 is unclear. Herein, we report our experience with a 66-year-old male patient undergoing maintenance peritoneal dialysis who became critically ill with COVID-19 and underwent several extracorporeal treatment approaches including plasma exchange, direct hemoperfusion using a polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column and continuous hemodiafiltration. Though the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) repeatedly and subacute cerebral infarction and finally died for respiratory failure on day 30 after admission, these attempts appeared to dampen the cytokine storm based on the observed decline in serum IL-6 levels and were effective against ARDS and secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. This case suggests the significance of timely initiation of extracorporeal treatment approaches in critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Nihei, Yoshihito; Nagasawa, Hajime; Fukao, Yusuke; Kihara, Masao; Ueda, Seiji; Gohda, Tomohito; Suzuki, Yusuke",CEN case reports,,636

Here, we report a massive crystallographic screening and computational docking effort, identifying new chemical matter primarily targeting the active site of the macrodomain. Crystallographic screening of 2533 diverse fragments resulted in 214 unique macrodomain-binders. An additional 60 molecules were selected from docking more than 20 million fragments, of which 20 were crystallographically confirmed. X-ray data collection to ultra-high resolution and at physiological temperature enabled assessment of the conformational heterogeneity around the active site. Several fragment hits were confirmed by solution binding using three biophysical techniques (differential scanning fluorimetry, homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence, and isothermal titration calorimetry). The 234 fragment structures explore a wide range of chemotypes and provide starting points for development of potent SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain inhibitors.","Schuller, Marion; Correy, Galen J; Gahbauer, Stefan; Fearon, Daren; Wu, Taiasean; Díaz, Roberto Efraín; Young, Iris D; Carvalho Martins, Luan; Smith, Dominique H; Schulze-Gahmen, Ursula; Owens, Tristan W; Deshpande, Ishan; Merz, Gregory E; Thwin, Aye C; Biel, Justin T; Peters, Jessica K; Moritz, Michelle; Herrera, Nadia; Kratochvil, Huong T; Aimon, Anthony; Bennett, James M; Brandao Neto, Jose; Cohen, Aina E; Dias, Alexandre; Douangamath, Alice; Dunnett, Louise; Fedorov, Oleg; Ferla, Matteo P; Fuchs, Martin R; Gorrie-Stone, Tyler J; Holton, James M; Johnson, Michael G; Krojer, Tobias; Meigs, George; Powell, Ailsa J; Rack, Johannes Gregor Matthias; Rangel, Victor L; Russi, Silvia; Skyner, Rachael E; Smith, Clyde A; Soares, Alexei S; Wierman, Jennifer L; Zhu, Kang; O039,; Brien, Peter; Jura, Natalia; Ashworth, Alan; Irwin, John J; Thompson, Michael C; Gestwicki, Jason E; von Delft, Frank",Sci.

Inhalation of nitric oxide (NO) gas is currently being investigated as a treatment for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. In addition to the expected vasodilation effect, it has been also suggested that NO potentially prevents infection by SARS-CoV-2. Since NO is an unstable radical molecule that is easily oxidized by multiple mechanisms in the human body, it is practically difficult to control its concentration at lesions that need NO. Inorganic nitrate and/or nitrite are known as precursors of NO that can be produced through chemical as well enzymatic reduction. It appears that this NO synthase (NOS)-independent mechanism has been overlooked in the current developing of clinical treatments. Here, I suggest the missing link between nitrate and COVID-19 in terms of hypoxic NO generation.","Yamasaki, Hideo",Nitric Oxide,,636

Early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment in order to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system. The standard image diagnosis tests for pneumonia are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan. Although CT scan is the gold standard, CXR are still useful because it is cheaper, faster and more widespread. This study aims to identify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other types and also healthy lungs using only CXR images. METHODS: In order to achieve the objectives, we have proposed a classification schema considering the following perspectives: i) a multi-class classification; ii) hierarchical classification, since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy. Given the natural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling algorithms in the schema in order to re-balance the classes distribution. We observed that, texture is one of the main visual attributes of CXR images, our classification schema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also using a pre-trained CNN model. We also explored early and late fusion techniques in the schema in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors and base classifiers at once. To evaluate the approach, we composed a database, named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs. The classes distribution follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others. RESULTS: The proposed approach tested in RYDLS-20 achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario. CONCLUSIONS: As far as we know, the top identification rate obtained in this paper is the best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes. We must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here.","Pereira, Rodolfo M; Bertolini, Diego; Teixeira, Lucas O; Silla, Carlos N; Costa, Yandre M G",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,636
373285,Banks' Liquidity Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint),2021,"Acute kidney injury is a common complication in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Similar to acute kidney injury associated with other conditions such as sepsis and cardiac surgery, morbidity and mortality are much higher in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who develop acute kidney injury, especially in the intensive care unit. Management of coronavirus disease 2019–associated acute kidney injury with kidney replacement therapy should follow existing recommendations regarding modality, dose, and timing of initiation. However, patients with coronavirus disease 2019 are very hypercoagulable, and close vigilance to anticoagulation strategies is necessary to prevent circuit clotting. During situations of acute surge, where demand for kidney replacement therapy outweighs supplies, conservative measures have to be implemented to safely delay kidney replacement therapy. A collaborative effort and careful planning is needed to conserve dialysis supplies, to ensure that treatment can be safely delivered to every patient who will benefit for kidney replacement therapy.","Shaikh, Sana; Matzumura Umemoto, Gonzalo; Vijayan, Anitha",Adv.

373653,Paediatric urology practice during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Overall mental health depends in part on the blood-brain barrier, which regulates nutrient transfer in-and-out of the brain and its central nervous system. Lactoferrin, an innate metal-transport protein, synthesized in the substantia nigra, particularly in dopaminergic neurons and activated microglia is vital for brain physiology. Lactoferrin rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier via receptor-mediated transcytosis and accumulates in the brain capillary endothelial cells. Lactoferrin receptors are additionally present on glioma cells, brain micro-vessels, and neurons. As a regulator of neuro-redox, microglial lactoferrin is critical for protection/repair of neurons and healthy brain function. Iron imbalance and oxidative stress are common among patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, depression, and multiple sclerosis. As an endogenous iron-chelator, lactoferrin prevents iron accumulation and dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease patients. Oral lactoferrin supplementation could modulate the p-Akt/PTEN pathway, reduce Aß deposition, and ameliorate cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Novel lactoferrin-based nano-therapeutics have emerged as effective drug-delivery systems for clinical management of neurodegenerative disorders. Recent emergence of the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, initially considered a respiratory illness, demonstrated a broader virulence spectrum with the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and inflict a plethora of neuropathological manifestations in the brain - the Neuro-COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are widely reported in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and multiple sclerosis patients with aggravated clinical outcomes. Lactoferrin, credited with several neuroprotective benefits in the brain could serve as a potential adjuvant in the clinical management of Neuro-COVID-19.","Naidu, Sreus A G; Wallace, Taylor C; Davies, Kelvin J A; Naidu, A Satyanarayan",J Diet Suppl,,636

Methods: The epidemic feature of COVID-19 was described by different phases and was used to observe the effectiveness of intervention. Hierarchical spot map was drawn to clarify the distribution and transmission risk of infection sources at different time points. The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Asymptomatic-Recovered model was established to estimate case numbers without intervention and compare with the actual number of cases to determine the effect of intervention. The positive rate of the nucleic acid test was used to reflect the risk of human exposure. A survey on COVID-19 related knowledge, attitude and behaviors were used to estimate the abilities of personal protection and emergency response. Results: The epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen experienced the rising, plateau and decline stage. The case number increased rapidly at the beginning, with short duration of peak period. Although the epidemic curve showed human-to-human transmission, the ""trailing"" was not obvious. From the spot map, during the intervention period, the source of infection was widely distributed. More cases and higher transmission risk were observed in areas with higher population density. After the effective intervention measures, both infection sources and the risk of transmission decreased. After compared with the estimated case numbers without intervention, actual number proved the COVID-19 control strategies were effective. The positive rate of nucleic acid test for high risk populations decreased and no new cases reported since February 16. Shenzhen citizens had high knowledge, attitude and behavior level, and high protection ability and emergency response. Conclusions: Although the response initiated by the health administration department played a key role at the early stage of the epidemic, it was not enough to contain the outbreak of COVID-19. The first-level emergency response initiated by provincial and municipal government was effective and ensured the start of work resumption after the Spring Festival.

METHODS: The online survey, conducted on social media in May 2020, yielded 1393 responses across the country (66% from the Adriatic area). The questionnaire consisted of socio-demographic questions and questions on the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to PPE use. The &#967;2 test, t test, and multivariate logistic regression were used in data analysis. RESULTS: As many as 84.0% of participants reported the compliance with social distancing measures, while 52.8% reported using PPE (mask and/or gloves) when shopping or visiting friends and family. Participants demonstrated good knowledge (mean of 10.4 [95% CI 10.3-10.4] correct answers out of 13 questions) and neutral to moderately positive attitude about PPE use (mean of 36.6 [36.1-37.1] out of 50 points). Participants with higher education, women, and health care workers had a greater probability for having a high knowledge score. Women, older individuals, public transport users, people with more positive PPE use attitude, and those who complied with social distancing had a higher probability of PPE use, while health care workers and highly educated participants had a reduced probability of PPE use in public. CONCLUSIONS: Croatians had good knowledge and neutral to moderately positive attitudes about PPE use. Nevertheless, health authorities need to promote positive attitudes about PPE use in order to retain trust and compliance with epidemiological measures.","Marendic, Mario; Bokan, Ivana; Buljan, Ivan; Dominikovic, Paula; Suton, Ruzica; Kolcic, Ivana",Croat Med J,,636

METHODS: The currently available literature was reviewed for microbiologically confirmed infections by 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 at the time of writing (13 February 2020). A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and Cochrane Library. Search terms included 'novel coronavirus' or '2019-nCoV' or 'COVID-19'. RESULTS: Published cases occurred mostly in males (age range, 8-92 years). Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases [e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis] that were surprisingly underreported. Fever was present in all of the case series available, flanked by cough, dyspnoea, myalgia and fatigue. Multiple bilateral lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV infection, at least in the early phases of the disease.

The present study investigates if unemployment increases the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization for men and women of working age in Germany. METHODS: The study uses the health insurance data from AOK Rhineland/Hamburg (from 1 January 2020 until 18 June 2020) of 1,288,745 persons aged between 18 and 65. Four employment situations are distinguished: (1) regular employment, (2) low-wage employment with social support, (3) unemployment with receipt of unemployment benefit 1, and (4) long-term unemployment with receipt of unemployment benefit 2. COVID-19 hospitalizations are measured on the basis of the ICD codes U07.1 and U07.2 reported by the hospitals. Multiple logistic regression models are calculated (adjusted for age and sex). RESULTS: During the observation period, 1521 persons had hospitalization with COVID-19 as primary or secondary diagnosis. Overall, this corresponds to a rate of 118 cases per 100,000 insured persons. Rates varied by employment situation. Compared with regularly employed persons, the odds ratio for a hospitalization was 1.94 (CI 95%: 1.74-2.15) for long-term unemployment, 1.29 (0.86-1.94) for unemployed, and 1.33 (0.98-1.82) for low-wage employment. CONCLUSION: The results are in line with earlier studies from the USA and Great Britain reporting socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 hospitalization risk. This provides the first empirical support that socioeconomic inequalities in the severity of COVID-19 also exists in Germany.","Wahrendorf, Morten; Rupprecht, Christoph J; Dortmann, Olga; Scheider, Maria; Dragano, Nico",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,636

There is very limited data regarding ASIA syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. OBJECTIVES: This work aims to report cases of subacute thyroiditis related to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. METHODS: We describe the clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of three cases of subacute thyroiditis after inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac®). Three female healthcare workers have applied to our clinic with anterior neck pain and fatigue four to seven days after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Two of them were in the breastfeeding period. They were negative for thyroid antibodies, and there was no previous history of thyroid disease or upper respiratory tract infection, or COVID-19. Laboratory test results and imaging findings were consistent with subacute thyroiditis. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can lead to subacute thyroiditis as a phenomenon of ASIA syndrome. Subacute thyroiditis may develop within a few days after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Being in the postpartum period may be a facilitating factor for the development of ASIA syndrome after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of subacute thyroiditis as a phenomenon of ASIA syndrome after inactivated COVID-19 vaccination. Clinicians should be aware that subacute thyroiditis may develop as a manifestation of ASIA syndrome after the inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","Iremli, Burçin Gönül; Sendur, Süleyman Nahit; Ünlütürk, Ugur",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,636
380916,Cardiac surgery in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection: Early experience,2020,"Much work has considered the evolution of pathogens, but little is known about how they respond to changes in host behaviour. We build a model of sublethal disease effects where hosts are able to choose to engage in prophylactic measures that reduce the likelihood of disease transmission. This choice is mediated by utility costs and benefits associated with prophylaxis, and the fraction of hosts engaged in prophylaxis is also affected by population dynamics. When prophylactic host behaviour occurs, we find that the level of pathogen host exploitation is reduced, by the action of selection, relative to the level that would otherwise be predicted in the absence of prophylaxis. Our work emphasizes the significance of the transmission-recovery trade-off faced by the pathogen and the ability of the pathogen to influence host prophylactic behaviour.","Mitchell, Evan; Wild, Geoff",J Theor Biol,,636
381564,"""Optimization of Surgical Resident Safety and Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic - Lessons Learned""",2020,"Covid-19 pandemic, continues all over the world with the increasing number of confirmed cases and performed tests day by day. It has been shown that collecting nasopharyngeal samples, as the most commonly prefered method to perform RT-PCR, has disadvantages like causing discomfort and bleeding in patients. Sample collecting procedure also renders healthcare professionals by exposing them to the risk of transmission of the virus related to the direct contact with patients. These disadvantages make this procedure undesirable for the researchers and forces them to search for an alternative technique. At this point, saliva appears as an opportunity, regarding its high viral load. On the other hand, this high viral load poses a threat, especially for professions such as dental practitioners, with too much aerosol exposure. Since dentistry is a branch of health that constantly needs direct operations, it is necessary to be protected from the virus as much as possible while caring for the patient. A literature review was done using electronic databases “PubMed,” “Google Scholar,” and “Cochrane Database,” on January 2021. Studies have proposed many different preventive measures in this regard. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to draw attention to the saliva by bringing together the recent research and also to provide information and a perspective to dental clinicians about both prevention and a potential diagnostic technique.","Sadikoglu, I.

The CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is used to solve many real-world problems with Artificial Intelligence (AI) based machines. We have proposed and implemented a multi-channeled Deep Convolutional Network (DCNN) for automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 disease from human respiratory sounds like a voice, dry cough, and breath, and it will give better accuracy and performance than previous models. We have applied multi-feature channels such as the data De-noising Auto Encoder (DAE) technique, GFCC (Gamma-tone Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), and IMFCC (Improved Multi-frequency Cepstral Coefficients) methods on augmented data to extract the deep features for the input of the CNN.

In this debate, the authors attempted to depict and reflect upon the overall framework of China's mental health support, with particular reference to the psychological intervention in response to COVID-19 over the last few months. Although a lot of effort has been made to meet the mental health needs, the accessibility, acceptability and effectiveness of the support system still have much room for improvement. Therefore, it is very important to re-think the predicament and challenge on ways of enhancing public mental health emergency responses in China. The concepts of universality, timeliness and scientific rigour were proposed as a possible reform in preparation for large-scale natural or man-made disasters in the coming future.","Ju, Yumeng; Zhang, Yan; Wang, Xiaoping; Li, Weihui; Ng, Roger M K; Li, Lingjiang",Global Health,,636

The present research aims at investigating the therapeutic potential of Chloroquine and its potent derivative Hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. At the same time screening was performed for some chemically synthesized derivatives of Chloroquine and compared their binding efficacy with chemically synthesized Chloroquine derivatives through in silico approaches. For the purpose of the study, some essential viral proteins and enzymes were selected that are implicated in SARS-CoV-2 replication and multiplication as putative drug targets. Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, and some of their chemically synthesized derivatives, taken from earlier published studies were selected as drug molecules. We have conducted molecular docking and related studies between Chloroquine and its derivatives and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, and the findings show that both Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine can bind to specific structural and non-structural proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection with different efficiencies. Our current study also shows that some of the chemically synthesized Chloroquine derivatives can also potentially inhibit various SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins by binding to them and concomitantly effectively disrupting the active site of these proteins. These findings bring into light another possible mechanism of action of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine and also pave the way for further drug repurposing and remodeling.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Population-based evaluation in a COVID-19 high-prevalence region. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the clinical course of OD and GD in a cohort of home-quarantined SARS-CoV-2-positive patients from Northern Italy. Physicians administered a survey-based questionnaire at recruitment (T0). During follow-up, patients responded to online dedicated surveys modulated according to symptoms at T0. RESULTS: A total of 151 patients completed the follow-up survey. OD and/or GD were observed in 83% and 89% of subjects, respectively. Resolution rates of OD and GD at 30 days from onset were 87% and 82%, respectively. Risk factors for late resolution were grade of dysfunction at onset (total vs partial), gender, and presence of nasal congestion. Three (2%) patients previously reporting complete resolution of symptoms complained of subsequent recurrence of OD and/or GD after a mean of 19 days from resolution of the previous episode. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related OD and GD had high rate of resolution in the first month from onset of symptoms. However, in 10% to 15% of patients, these symptoms showed only partial improvement after this period.","Paderno, Alberto; Mattavelli, Davide; Rampinelli, Vittorio; Grammatica, Alberto; Raffetti, Elena; Tomasoni, Michele; Gualtieri, Tommaso; Taboni, Stefano; Zorzi, Silvia; Del Bon, Francesca; Lombardi, Davide; Deganello, Alberto; Redaelli De Zinis, Luca Oscar; Schreiber, Alberto",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,636

Using this model, we were able to reproduce the real behavior of the epidemic with an average error of 5\%. Moreover, we illustrate possible future scenarios, associated to different intervals of $R_0$. This model has been used since the beginning of March 2020, predicting the Italian peak of the epidemic in April 2020 with about 100.000 detected active cases. The real peak of the epidemic happened on the 20th of April 2020, with 108.000 active cases.

A total of 668 adults (64.7% males, M = 28.12 years, SD = 9.09 years) participated in the online survey. The participants were grouped as; yoga practitioners, other spiritual practitioners, and non-practitioners based on their responses to daily practices that they follow. Yoga practitioners were further examined based on the duration of practice as; long-term, mid-term and beginners. Multivariate analysis indicates that yoga practitioners had significantly lower depression, anxiety, & stress (DASS), and higher general wellbeing (SWGB) as well as higher peace of mind (POMS) than the other two groups. The results further revealed that the yoga practitioners significantly differed in the perception of personal control, illness concern and emotional impact of COVID19. However, there was no significant difference found for the measure of resilience (BRS) in this study. Yoga practitioners also significantly differed in the cognitive reappraisal strategy for regulating their emotions than the other two groups. Interestingly, it was found that beginners -those who had started practicing yoga only during the lockdown period reported no significant difference for general wellbeing and peace of mind when compared to the mid- term practitioner. Evidence supports that yoga was found as an effective self- management strategy to cope with stress, anxiety and depression, and maintain wellbeing during COVID19 lockdown.","Sahni, Pooja Swami; Singh, Kamlesh; Sharma, Nitesh; Garg, Rahul",PLoS One,,636

Any CNS disease in which the neuronal myelin sheath is damaged is referred to as demyelinating disease. The present work was designed to study the histopathological, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical changes in rat brain, mainly corpus callosum (CC), following oral administration of cuprizone (CPZ), and the role of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in reducing these changes. Demyelination was induced by CPZ administration for short (4Ws) and long (8Ws) periods. NAC was given concomitantly and sequentially for similar periods. Spontaneous recovery after cessation of CPZ followed by no medication was also investigated. At the end of each experimental period, both cerebral hemispheres were extracted and prepared for light and electron microscopic examination and immuno-histochemical study. The obtained results showed a direct proportion between the duration of CPZ administration and the severity of demyelination. The co-administration of CPZ and NAC, had a fair protective impact that was stronger than the sequential administration of the two drugs. Incomplete spontaneous remyelination was observed after cessation of CPZ, being more evident in short than in long period group, indicating that when CPZ administration is prolonged, remyelination is delayed. In the light of the above results, it could be concluded that NAC has neuroprotective effects and has the potential to be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis; however, treatment should begin as soon as the disease manifests.","El Sharouny, S H; Shaaban, M H; Elsayed, R M; Tahef, A W; Abd ElWahed, M K",Folia morphol.

388371,Barriers to Vaccination for COVID-19 Control - Experience from the United States,2021,"International spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has prompted many MRI scanning facilities to require scan subjects to wear a facial covering (""mask"") during scanning as a precaution against transmission of the virus. Because wearing a mask mixes expired air with the subject's inspired air stream, the concentration of inspired carbon dioxide [CO2] is elevated, resulting in mild hypercapnia. Changes in the inspired gas mixture have been demonstrated to alter R2*-weighted Blood Oxygen Dependent (BOLD) contrast. In this study, we investigate a potential for face masking to alter BOLD contrast during a sensory-motor task designed to activate visual, auditory, and sensorimotor cortices in 8 subjects. We utilize a nasal cannula to supply air to the subject wearing a surgical mask in on-off blocks of 90s to displace expired CO2, while the subject performs the sensory-motor task. While only a small fraction (2.5%) of the sensory-motor task activation is related to nasal air modulation, a 30.0% change in gray matter BOLD signal baseline is found due to air modulation. Repeating the scan with mask removed produces a small subject-specific bias in BOLD baseline signal from nasal air supply, which may be due to cognitive influence of airflow or cannula-induced hypoxia. Measurements with capnography demonstrate wearing a mask induces an average increase in ETCO2 of 7.4%. Altogether, these results demonstrate that wearing a face mask during gradient-echo fMRI can alter BOLD baseline signal but minimally affects task activation.","Law, Christine S W; Lan, Patricia S; Glover, Gary H",Neuroimage,,636

As the testing of coronavirus happened manually in the initial stage, the ever-increasing number of COVID-19 cannot be handled efficiently. Also, the coronavirus is divided into 3 phases and it has different effects on lungs. To handle this situation, researchers have attempted to detect coronavirus using chest X-ray images and Chest CT scan images by using Artificial Intelligence [AI] technologies. AI helps to forecast the coronavirus cases for analysing the virus structure and chest X-Ray and CT scan images helps to predict the stags of corona virus. Henceforth, this paper has developed a CNN model, which utilizes 3 classes as follows: positive COVID-19 images, normal images and viral pneumonia images. The model has been trained on these set of images and got 94% of accuracy on training dataset and 96% of accuracy on validation dataset. The proposed model has achieved the test accuracy of 94% for 3 classes in Chest X-Ray image classification. The main motive behind developing this model is to reduce its computational time by using less layers and more hyper parameter tuning. The proposed model is compared with pre-existing models as they were more complex and took much training time. Till now 94% of accuracy has been achieved on test dataset. © 2021 IEEE.","Sharma, S.; Tiwari, S.","Proc. - Int. Conf. Artif. Intell. Smart Syst., ICAIS",,636
389297,Health Inequalities During COVID-19 and Their Effects on Morbidity and Mortality,2021,"The epidemic of pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been listed as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO), and its harm degree is defined as a global ""pandemic"". At present, the efforts of various countries focus on the rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients, as well as to find a treatment that can combat the most serious impact of the disease. The number of reported COVID-19 virus infections is still increasing. Unfortunately, no drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of human coronaviruses, but there is an urgent need for in-depth research on emerging human infectious coronaviruses. Clarification transmission routes and pathogenic mechanisms, and identification of potential drug treatment targets will promote the development of effective prevention and treatment measures. In the absence of confirmed effective treatments, due to public health emergencies, it is essential to study the possible effects of existing approved antivirals drugs or Chinese herbal medicines for SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes the epidemiological characteristics, pathogenesis, virus structure and targeting strategies of COVID-19. Meanwhile, this review also focus on the re-purposing of clinically approved drugs and Chinese herbal medicines that may be used to treat COVID-19 and provide new ideas for the discovery of small molecular compounds with potential therapeutic effects on novel COVID-19.","Huang, Fangfang; Li, Ying; Leung, Elaine Lai-Han; Liu, Xiaohua; Liu, Kaifeng; Wang, Qu; Lan, Yongqi; Li, Xiaoling; Yu, Haibing; Cui, Liao; Luo, Hui; Luo, Lianxiang",Pharmacol Res,,636
389796,Changes in nutrition and lifestyle habits during the covid-19 pandemic in Turkey and the effects of healthy eating attitudes,2021,"Clinical practice in intensive care units (ICUs) requires early warnings when a patient's condition is about to deteriorate so that preventive measures can be undertaken. To this end, prediction algorithms have been developed that estimate the risk of mortality in ICUs. In this work, we propose a novel generative deep probabilistic model for real-time risk scoring in ICUs. Specifically, we develop an attentive deep Markov model called AttDMM. To the best of our knowledge, AttDMM is the first ICU prediction model that jointly learns both long-term disease dynamics (via attention) and different disease states in health trajectory (via a latent variable model). Our evaluations were based on an established baseline dataset (MIMIC-III) with 53,423 ICU stays. The results confirm that compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our AttDMM was superior: AttDMM achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.876, which yielded an improvement over the state-of-the-art method by 2.2%. In addition, the risk score from the AttDMM provided warnings several hours earlier. Thereby, our model shows a path towards identifying patients at risk so that health practitioners can intervene early and save patient lives.","Ozyurt, Yilmazcan; Kraus, Mathias; Hatt, Tobias; Feuerriegel, Stefan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04702v2.pdf,636

Retrospective cohort study with patients evaluated for COVID-19 pneumonia in the ED, from March 3 to April 30, 2020. All of them were discharged home and controlled by HH. The main outcomes were ED revisit and the need for deferred hospital admission (protocol failure). Outcome predictors were analyzed by simple logistic regression model (OR; 95% CI). Potential savings of this medical care model were estimated. Of the 377 patients attended in the ED, 109 were identified as having mild pneumonia and were included in the ED/HH medical care model. Median age was 50.0 years, 52.3% were males and 57.8% had Charlson index &#8805; 1. The median HH stay was 8 (IQR 3.7-11) days. COVID-19-related ED revisit was 19.2% (n = 21) within 6 days (IQR 3-12.5) after discharge from ED. Overall protocol failure (deferred hospital admission) was 6.4% (n = 7), without ICU admission. The ED/HH model provided potential cost savings of 77% compared to traditional stay, due to the costs of home care entails 23% of the expenses generated by a conventional hospital stay. 789 days of hospital stay were avoided by HH, rather than hospital admission. An innovative ED/HH model for selected patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia is feasible, safe and effective. Less than 6.5% of patients requiring deferred hospital admission and potential savings were generated due to hospitalization.","Llorens, Pere; Moreno-Pérez, Oscar; Espinosa, Begoña; García, Tamara; Payá, Ana Belén; Sola, Sonia; Molina, Francisca; Román, Francisco; Jiménez, Inmaculada; Guzman, Sergio; Gil-Rodrigo, Adriana; Peña-Pardo, Bárbara; Merino, Esperanza; Gil, Joan; San-Inocencio, David; Andrés, Mariano; Sánchez-Payá, José",Intern. emerg. med,,636
391102,"Rapid Publication, Knowledge Sharing, and Our Responsibility During the COVID-19 Pandemic",2020,"The performance of ride-sourcing services such as Uber and Lyft is determined by the collective choices of individual drivers who are not only chauffeurs but private fleet providers. In such a context, ride-sourcing drivers are free to decide whether to accept or decline ride requests assigned by the ride-hailing platform. Drivers' ride acceptance behaviour can significantly influence system performance in terms of riders' waiting time (associated with the level of service), drivers' occupation rate and idle time (related to drivers' income), and platform revenue and reputation. Hence, it is of great importance to identify the underlying determinants of the ride acceptance behaviour of drivers. To this end, we collected a unique dataset from ride-sourcing drivers working in the United States and the Netherlands through a cross-sectional stated preference experiment designed based upon disparate information conveyed to the respondents. Using a choice modelling approach, we estimated the effects of various existing and hypothetical attributes influencing the ride acceptance choice. Employment status, experience level with the platform, and working shift are found to be the key individual-specific determinants. Part-time and beginning drivers who work on midweek days (Monday-Thursday) have a higher tendency to accept ride offers. Results also reveal that pickup time, which is the travel time between the driver's location and the rider's waiting spot, has a negative impact on ride acceptance. Moreover, the findings suggest that a guaranteed tip (i.e., the minimum amount of tip that is indicated upfront by the prospective rider, a feature that is currently not available) and an additional income due to surge pricing are valued noticeably higher than trip fare. The provided insights can be used to develop customised matching and pricing strategies to improve system efficiency.","Ashkrof, Peyman; Correia, Gonccalo Homem de Almeida; Cats, Oded; Arem, Bart van",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07864v1.pdf,636

This survey was performed to assess aspects of this process including training & education, tasks expected, availability of personal protection equipment (PPE) used and the overall anxiety of ophthalmologists around their redeployment. METHOD: Online anonymous survey around the existing guidance on safe redeployment of secondary care NHS staff and PPE use by NHS England and Public Health England respectively. The survey was open to all ophthalmologists across the UK irrespective of their redeployment status. FINDINGS: 145 surveys were completed and returned during a 2-week period between 17th April 2020 and 1st May 2020, when 52% of ophthalmologists were redeployed. The majority of this group consisted of ophthalmologists in training (79%). 81% of those redeployed were assigned to areas of the hospital where patients with confirmed Coronavirus disease were being treated as inpatients. There was a statistically significant improvement in anxiety level following redeployment which was mainly attributed to the support received by staff within the redeployed area. 71% of the redeployed group were found to have sufficient PPE was provided for the area they worked in. INTERPRETATION: This is the first national survey performed on redeployment of ophthalmologists in the UK. The study showed that ophthalmologists across all grades were able to contribute in most aspects of patient care. Anxiety of redeployment was reduced by prior training and good support in the redeployment area.","Lim, Christina; De Silva, Ian; Moussa, George; Islam, Tahir; Osman, Lina; Malick, Huzaifa; Deol, Sundeep; Youssef, Moheeb; Farrag, Abdelsattar; Ashraf, Rehana; Burgula, Sreekala; Thompson, Jonathan",Eur J Ophthalmol,,636

Learning from past epidemics enables public health authorities to assess aspects of the overall response system to improve the system. Moreover, learning during a crisis makes it possible to develop an approach to address unique and rapidly evolving epidemic situations. In this study, the literature was reviewed, and interviews were conducted with a director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a regulatory manager of a multinational medical equipment company. On the basis of that research, this article examines how crisis learning has facilitated a South Korean disease control agency’s surveillance of infectious diseases and its development of in vitro diagnosis kits. Those kits enabled qualified private health providers to diagnose COVID-19 infections in cooperation with multiple partners in the early period of the outbreak response. The agency’s learning from a past epidemic crisis, shared sense-making, and proactive efforts helped the nation to flatten the curve of the numbers of the confirmed cases in a short period of time.

Deferment of elective surgeries and procedures coupled with a shift of resources toward increased inpatient clinical needs for the care of COVID-19 patients has resulted in substantially decreased imaging examinations at many institutions. Additionally, both infection control and risk mitigation measures have resulted in minimal on-site staffing of both trainees and staff radiologists at many institutions. As a result, residents have been placed in nonstandard learning environments, including working from home, engaging in a virtual curriculum, and participating in training sessions in preparation for potential reassignment to other patient care settings. Typically, for residents to gain the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience to practice independently upon graduation, radiology training programs must provide an optimal balance between resident education and clinical obligations. We describe our experience adapting to the challenges in educational interruptions and clinical work reassignments of 41 interventional and diagnostic radiology residents at a large academic center. We highlight opportunities for collaboration and teamwork in creatively adjusting and planning for the short and long-term impact of the pandemic on resident education. This experience shows how the residency educational paradigm was shifted during a pandemic and can serve as a template to address future disruptions.","Shi, Junzi; Miskin, Nityanand; Dabiri, Borna E; DeSimone, Ariadne K; Schaefer, Peter M; Matalon, Shanna A; Uyeda, Jennifer W; Guenette, Jeffrey P; Gaviola, Glenn C",Clin Imaging,,636

393931,Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) across countries: Measurement invariance issues,2021,"Viruses are nanomaterials with a number of properties that surpass those of many synthetic nanoparticles (NPs) for biomedical applications. They possess a rigorously ordered structure, come in a variety of shapes, and present unique surface elements, such as spikes. These attributes facilitate propitious biodistribution, the crossing of complex biological barriers and a minutely coordinated interaction with cells. Due to the orchestrated sequence of interactions of their stringently arranged particle corona with cellular surface receptors they effectively identify and infect their host cells with utmost specificity, while evading the immune system at the same time. Furthermore, their efficacy is enhanced by their response to stimuli and the ability to spread from cell to cell. Over the years, great efforts have been made to mimic distinct viral traits to improve biomedical nanomaterial performance. However, a closer look at the literature reveals that no comprehensive evaluation of the benefit of virus-mimetic material design on the targeting efficiency of nanomaterials exists. In this review we, therefore, elucidate the impact that viral properties had on fundamental advances in outfitting nanomaterials with the ability to interact specifically with their target cells. We give a comprehensive overview of the diverse design strategies and identify critical steps on the way to reducing them to practice. More so, we discuss the advantages and future perspectives of a virus-mimetic nanomaterial design and try to elucidate if viral mimicry holds the key for better NP targeting.","Maslanka Figueroa, Sara; Fleischmann, Daniel; Goepferich, Achim",J. control. release,,636

The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) chart and PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist were used to document the review process. The McMaster critical review checklist was used to determine the quality of the included studies. Thematic analyses were conducted using NVivo version 12. RESULTS: Three studies showed evidence on the impact of COVID-19 and family planning services, six studies reported on maternal and child services and eleven studies reported on sexual health (sexual behavior). Limited access to family planning use, reduction in multiple sexual partnership, decreased transactional sex, and maternal and child services disruption were some impacts reported in the included studies. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated the impacts of COVID-19 on family planning access, multiple sexual partnership, transactional sex, and disruption of maternal and child health services. Interventions that will consider the immediate availability of and access to all sexual and reproductive health services should be prioritized.","Bolarinwa, O. A.; Ahinkorah, B. O.; Seidu, A.

394419,Impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on scientific research and implications for clinical academic training - A review,2021,"Before the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged Africa, a large percentage of Africans were already affected by poverty and food insecurity. The pandemic wreaked havoc on their already unfavorable situation. The direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 included but not limited to illness and deaths of food systems' workers, interruption of food supply chains, unemployment, depreciation of currency value, and disruption of social protection programs. COVID-19 will lead to further economic fallout. Thus, the situation needs careful observation and timely intervention to safeguard the vulnerable African communities. Although Africa has sought ways to lessen the dire impact of the pandemic on food security, short-term solutions should include and enhance social and economic relief initiatives such as monetary intervention and social safety net. Considering a balance between health benefits of COVID-19 restrictions and their economic implications, the African countries, at the regional level, must preserve open and efficient social protection programs and cross-border supply and distribution networks for agricultural inputs. Africa's medium- and long-term strategies for improving food security should include improving and diversifying its agricultural productivity and production of key food commodities. This will reduce Africa's dependence on importation of these key commodities, and will help the continent address underlying economic vulnerabilities and better manage food, pandemic, and/or health-related crises affecting food security in the long term.","Ali Mohamed, Esraa Mahadi; Alhaj Abdallah, Samar Mohammed; Ahmadi, Attaullah; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,636

For conditions within the respiratory tract, targeted drug delivery directly to the site of action can achieve a high local concentration for efficacy with reduced unwanted systemic exposure and adverse effect. For systemic conditions, the unique physiology of the lung evolutionarily designed for rapid gaseous exchange presents an entry route for systemic drug delivery. Although the development of inhaled formulations has come a long way over the last few decades, many aspects of it remain to be elucidated. In particular, a reliable and well-understood method for in vitro-in vivo correlations remains to be established. With the rapid and ongoing advancement of technology, there is much potential to better utilise computational methods including different types of modelling and simulation approaches to support inhaled formulation development. This review intends to provide an introduction on some fundamental concepts in pulmonary drug delivery and inhaled formulation development followed by discussions on some challenges and opportunities in the translation of inhaled pharmaceuticals from preclinical studies to clinical development. The review concludes with some recent advancements in modelling and simulation approaches that could play an increasingly important role in contemporary formulation development of inhaled pharmaceuticals.","Sou, Tomás; Bergström, Christel A S",J. pharm. sci,,636

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the risk factors for mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with severe and critical COVID-19 from four hospitals in Wuhan, China, by evaluating the clinical characteristics and laboratory results, and using Cox proportional hazards model to assess the risk factors involved in disease progression. RESULTS: In total, 446 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The study indicated a high mortality rate (20.2%) in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. At the time of admission, all patients required oxygen therapy, and 52 (12%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, of which 50 (96%) died. The univariate Cox proportional hazards model showed a white blood cell count of more than 10 × 109/L (HR 3.993,95%CI 2.469 to 6.459) that correlated with an increased mortality rate. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that older age (HR 1.066, 95% CI 1.043 to 1.089) and higher white blood cell count (HR 1.135, 95% CI 1.080 to 1.192) were independent risk factors for determining COVID-19 associated mortality. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with a significant risk of morbidity and mortality in the population. Older age and higher white blood cell count were found to be independent risk factors for mortality.","Wang, Liulin; Cheng, Xiaobin; Dong, Qiufen; Zhou, Chenliang; Wang, Yeming; Song, Bin; Li, Weinan; Wang, Min; Qin, Rui; Long, Qi; Liu, Juan; Li, Jing; Li, Dan; Li, Gang; Ba, Yuanming",BMC Infect Dis,,636

397350,Self-Interested Framed and Prosocially Framed Messaging Can Equally Promote COVID-19 Prevention Intention: A Replication and Extension of Jordan et al.'s Study (2020) in the Japanese Context,2021,"Real-world drug repurposing-the immediate ""off-label"" prescribing of drugs to address urgent clinical needs-is an indispensable strategy gaining rapid traction in the current COVID-19 crisis. Although off-label prescribing (ie, for a nonapproved indication) is legal in most countries, it tends to shift the burden of liability and cost to physicians and patients, respectively. Nevertheless, in urgent public health crises, it is often the only realistic source of a meaningful potential solution. To be considered for real-world repurposing, drug candidates should ideally have a track record of safety, affordability, and wide accessibility. Although thousands of such drugs are already available, the absence of a central repository of off-label uses presents a barrier to the immediate identification and selection of the safest, potentially useful interventions. Using the current COVID-19 pandemic as an example, we provide a glimpse at the extensive literature that supports the rationale behind six generic drugs, in four classes, all of which are affordable, supported by decades of safety data, and pleiotropically target the underlying pathophysiology that makes COVID-19 so dangerous. Having previously fast-tracked this paper to publication in summary form, we now expand on why cimetidine/famotidine (histamine type-2 receptor antagonists), dipyridamole (antiplatelet agent), fenofibrate/bezafibrate (cholesterol/triglyceride-lowering agents), and sildenafil (phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor) are worth considering for patients with COVID-19 based on their antiviral, anti-inflammatory, renoprotective, cardioprotective, and anticoagulation properties. These examples also reveal the unlimited opportunity to future-proof public health by proactively mining, synthesizing, and cataloging the off-label treatment opportunities of thousands of safe, well-established, and affordable generic drugs.","Rogosnitzky, Moshe; Berkowitz, Esther; Jadad, Alejandro R",JMIRx Med,,636

As the number of COVID-19 positive patients across the nation continues to increase, the need for options to address ventilator shortages is inevitable. Multi-patient ventilation (MPV), in which more than one patient can use a single ventilator base unit, has been proposed as a potential solution to this problem. To our knowledge, this option has been discussed but remains untested in live patients with differing severity of lung pathology. METHODS: The objective of this study was to address ventilator shortages and patient stacking limitations by developing and validating a modified breathing circuit for two patients with differing lung compliances using simple, off-the-shelf components. A multi-patient ventilator circuit (MPVC) was simulated with a mathematical model and validated with four animal studies. Each animal study had two human-sized pigs: one healthy and one with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced ARDS. LPS was chosen because it lowers lung compliance similar to COVID-19. In a previous study, a control group of four pigs was given ARDS and placed on a single patient ventilation circuit (SPVC). The oxygenation of the MPVC ARDS animals was then compared to the oxygenation of the SPVC animals. RESULTS: Based on the comparisons, similar oxygenation and morbidity rates were observed between the MPVC ARDS animals and the SPVC animals. CONCLUSION: As healthcare systems worldwide deal with inundated ICUs and hospitals from pandemics, they could potentially benefit from this approach by providing more patients with respiratory care.","Wankum, Benjamin P; Reynolds, Riley E; McCain, Andrea R; Zollinger, Nathaniel T; Buesing, Keely L; Sindelar, Russel D; Freihaut, Frank M; Fekadu, Tariku; Terry, Benjamin S",J Anesth,,636

To explore an alternate way to determine activity of brachytherapy plaques. METHODS: The surface dose rates of 106Ru/106Rh plaque developed indigenously were measured by extrapolation chamber. To rule out possibility of any error in the activity distribution and quantity, same source was used in two different configurations namely planar and curved. EBT3 Gafchromic film was used for determination of uniformity in activity. Monte Carlo-based Codes EGSnrc and FLUKA were used to calculate dose rate in tissue, percentage depth dose and for determination of activity. Parameters and correction factors were estimated using simulations. RESULTS: The measured reference absorbed dose rates for planar and curved 106Ru/106Rh eye plaques are found to be 589 ± 29 mGy/h and 560 ± 28 mGy/h, respectively. The difference in the reference absorbed dose rate of curved eye plaque is about ~5% as compared to planar configuration. The FLUKA-calculated dose values are almost independent of cavity length of the extrapolation chamber for both eye plaques. The FLUKA-based dose rates per µCi 106Ru/106Rh are about 17.28 ± 0.08 mGy/h and 16.48 ± 0.06 mGy/h, respectively for planar and curved eye plaques which match well with the measurements. The calculated activities for planar and curved eye plaques are 34.08 µCi and 33.98 µCi, respectively.

METHODS: In total, 32 healthy adults and 6 patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) received adjuvant QIV during 2018-2019 influenza season. Depending on initial antibody titers, healthy volunteers were divided into seronegative (&#8804;1:20) and seropositive (&#8805;1:40). To evaluate immunogenicity hemagglutination inhibition assay was used. RESULTS: All participants completed the study without developing serious post-vaccination reactions. Analysis of antibody titer 3 weeks after immunization in healthy participants showed that seroprotection, seroconversion levels, GMR and GMT for strains A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B/Colorado, B/Phuket among initially seronegative and seropositive participants meet the criterion of CHMP effectiveness. CVID patients showed increase in post-vaccination antibody titer without reaching conditionally protective antibody levels. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant QIV promotes formation of specific immunity to vaccine strains, regardless of antibodies' presence or absence before. In CVID patients search of new regimens should be continued.","Kostinov, Mikhail P; Latysheva, Elena A; Kostinova, Aristitsa M; Akhmatova, Nelly K; Latysheva, Tatyana V; Vlasenko, Anna E; Dagil, Yulia A; Khromova, Ekaterina A; Polichshuk, Valentina B",,,636

(COVID-19 preparedness: Lessons learned from the pandemic center: Issue 1.),2020,"BACKGROUND: The primary aim was to evaluate the efficacy of financial incentives for reducing paediatric tobacco smoke exposures (TSEs) through motivating cigarette usage reduction among low-income maternal caregivers and members of their social network. DESIGN: Randomised control pilot trial over a 6-month study follow-up time period. The study was undertaken from May 2017 to -May 2018. Once monthly follow-up visits occurred over the 6-month study period. SETTING: Baltimore City, Maryland, USA. PARTICIPANTS: We grouped 135 participants into 45 triads (asthmatic child (2-12 years of age), maternal caregiver and social network member). Triads were assigned in a 1:1 allocation ratio. The maternal caregiver and social network members were active smokers and contributed to paediatric TSE. INTERVENTIONS: Triads were randomised to receive either usual care (TSE education and quitline referrals) or usual care plus financial incentives. Cash incentives up to $1000 were earned by caregivers and designated social network participants. Incentives for either caregivers or social network participants were provided contingent on their individual reduction of tobacco usage measured by biomarkers of tobacco usage. Study visits occurred once a month during the 6-month trial. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was mean change in monthly paediatric cotinine levels over 6 months of follow-up interval and was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: The mean change in monthly child cotinine values was not significantly different in the intervention cohort over the 6-month follow-up period, compared with the control group (p=0.098, CI -0.16 to 1.89). Trends in child cotinine could not be ascribed to caregivers or social network members. Despite decreasing mean monthly cotinine values, neither the intervention cohort's caregivers (difference in slope (control-intervention)=3.30 ng/mL/month, CI -7.72 to 1.13, p=0.144) or paired social network members (difference in slope (control-intervention)=-1.59 ng/mL/month, CI -3.57 to 6.74, p=0.546) had significantly different cotinine levels than counterparts in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Financial incentives directed at adult contributors to paediatric TSE did not decrease child cotinine levels.

As his fever did not improve until 8 days after, he was admitted into another acute care hospital, where his respiratory condition rapidly worsened. Therefore, the patient was transferred to our hospital. On the day of transfer (day 1), he was started on mechanical ventilation. COVID-19 was diagnosed using a polymerase chain reaction assay 6 days after admission (day 6). The rehabilitation therapy was begun on day 6. The initial rehabilitation programs focused on positioning and postural drainage. The patient was extubated on day 19, and he began standing and stepping on the same day. Gait exercises began on day 22, and endurance training was initiated on day 28. The patient was discharged from our hospital on day 34 as he met the physical function milestones. One month after discharge, the Medical Research Council sum score and Barthel Index had each improved; therefore, muscle strength and daily activities had returned to normal. It was assumed that mobilization should be performed as soon as possible after the end of sedation during the acute phase of severe COVID-19 infection in patients receiving mechanical ventilation.","Saeki, Takuya; Ogawa, Fumihiro; Chiba, Ryosuke; Nonogaki, Manabu; Uesugi, Jo; Takeuchi, Ichiro; Nakamura, Takeshi",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,,636

Sex however affects several aspects of IHD, including pathophysiology, incidence, clinical presentation, diagnosis as well as treatment and outcome. Several diseases or risk factors frequently associated with IHD can modify cellular signalling cascades, thus affecting ischemia/reperfusion injury as well as responses to cardioprotective interventions. Importantly, the prevalence and impact of risk factors and several comorbidities differ between males and females, and their effects on IHD development and prognosis might differ according to sex. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these differences are still poorly understood, and their identification might have important translational implications in the prediction or prevention of risk of IHD in men and women. Despite this, most experimental studies on IHD are still undertaken in animal models in the absence of risk factors and comorbidities, and assessment of potential sex-specific differences are largely missing. This ESC WG Position Paper will discuss: a) the importance of sex as a biological variable in cardiovascular research, b) major biological mechanisms underlying sex-related differences relevant to IHD risk factors and comorbidities, c) prospects and pitfalls of preclinical models to investigate these associations, and finally d) will provide recommendations to guide future research.

To do this, we provide a platform for studying the news by measuring this overlap and scoring news stories according to the degree of attention in near-real time. This can enable multiple studies, including identifying topics that receive the most attention from news organizations and identifying slow news days versus major news days. Our application, StoryGraph, periodically (10-minute intervals) extracts the first five news articles from the RSS feeds of 17 US news media organizations across the partisanship spectrum (left, center, and right). From these articles, StoryGraph extracts named entities (PEOPLE, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS, etc.) and then represents each news article with its set of extracted named entities. Finally, StoryGraph generates a news similarity graph where the nodes represent news articles, and an edge between a pair of nodes represents a high degree of similarity between the nodes (similar news stories). Each news story within the news similarity graph is assigned an attention score which quantifies the amount of attention the topics in the news story receive collectively from the news media organizations. The StoryGraph service has been running since August 2017, and using this method, we determined that the top news story of 2018 was the""Kavanaugh hearings""with attention score of 25.85 on September 27, 2018.

401179,Changes in the consumption of foods characterising the Mediterranean dietary pattern and major correlates during the COVID-19 confinement in Italy: results from two cohort studies,2021,"The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has brought countries around the world to a standstill in the early part of 2020. Several nations and territories around the world insisted their population stay indoors for practicing social distance in order to avoid infecting the disease. Consequently, industrial activities, businesses, and all modes of traveling have halted. On the other hand, the pollution level decreased ‘temporarily’ in our living environment. As fewer pollutants are supplied in to the hydrosphere, and human recreational activities are stopped completely during the lockdown period, we hypothesize that the hydrological residence time (HRT) has increased in the semi-enclosed or closed lake bodies, which can in turn increase the primary productivity. To validate our hypothesis, and to understand the effect of lockdown on primary productivity in aquatic systems, we quantitatively estimated the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in different lake bodies using established Chl-a retrieval algorithm. The Chl-a monitored using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 sensor in the lake bodies of Wuhan, China, showed an elevated concentration of Chl-a. In contrast, no significant changes in Chl-a are observed for Vembanad Lake in India. Further analysis of different geo-environments is necessary to validate the hypothesis.","Avtar, Ram Kumar Pankaj Supe Hitesh Jie Dou Sahu Netranada Mishra Binaya Kumar Yunus Ali P.",Water,,636

In order to achieve this ambition, there is a need for new and more mineral extraction which is necessary for the technology for this low-carbon transition. These minerals are known as critical minerals and this article examines the role of justice needed in their development. The literature to-date lacks any holistic yet focused examination of the key elements of justice in the development of this industry. This conceptual article makes an original contribution that utilises an interdisciplinary perspective, legal geography, and explores key issues of justice that include distributive, procedural, restorative, recognition and cosmopolitan. The research identifies the key questions that need to be resolved under each element of justice and the unfortunate limited timeframes for action. Critical justice areas include taxation, environmental impact assessments, waste management, social license to operate, and cross-border actions. Resolving these issues will directly address societal issues of inequality and ensure a just transition to a low-carbon economy. Already there is a global race for critical minerals, and justice needs a stronger role in its development based on evidence to-date.","Heffron, Raphael J",Extr Ind Soc,,636

A population mental health perspective informed by clinical psychology, psychiatry and dissemination and implementation science is ideally suited to address the broad, multi-faceted and long-lasting mental health impact of the pandemic. Informed by a systematic review of the burgeoning empirical research on the COVID-19 pandemic and research on prior coronavirus pandemics, we link pandemic risk factors, negative mental health outcomes and appropriate intervention strategies. We describe how social risk factors and pandemic stressors will contribute to negative mental health outcomes, especially among vulnerable populations. We evaluate the scalability of primary, secondary and tertiary interventions according to mental health target, population, modality, intensity and provider type to provide a unified strategy for meeting population mental health needs. Traditional models, in which evidence-based therapies delivered are delivered in-person, by a trained expert, at a specialty care location have proved difficult to scale. The use of non-traditional models, tailoring preventive interventions to populations based on their needs, and ongoing coordinated evaluation of intervention implementation and effectiveness will be critical to refining our efforts to increase reach.","Boden, Matt; Zimmerman, Lindsey; Azevedo, Kathryn J; Ruzek, Josef I; Gala, Sasha; Abdel Magid, Hoda S; Cohen, Nichole; Walser, Robyn; Mahtani, Naina D; Hoggatt, Katherine J; McLean, Carmen P",Clin Psychol Rev,,636

We answered the question whether the higher sensitivity of women and elderly persons is quantitatively meaningful. Specifically, we investigated if it is large enough to hamper the diagnosis, classification and follow-up of pain conditions by clinicians. Materials and Methods: From each age stratum (18-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, and >80 years), 40 pain-free women and 40 pain-free men were recruited. They rated the intensity of pressure of ten Newtons over ten seconds on an analogue zero to ten rating scale. The pressure was applied on their middle fingers and ear lobes with a threshold algometer. Centile curves visualized the sex- and age-dependent fluctuation of pressure sensitivity. Results: Over the entire age range from 20 to 80 years, the median curves fluctuated within the interval of less than two points. The distance between the median curves of men and women was also less than two points. On the average, the median difference was half a point on the finger (p = 0.249) and the ear lobe (p = 0.083). Conclusion: Less than two points is below the minimal clinically important difference for a zero to ten analogue pain rating scale; differences smaller than one point are even below the resolution of the scale.

METHODS: We recruited 73 patients with COVID-19 [49 men and 24 women; average age: 58.36 years (SD: 14.31)] admitted to the intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from December 30, 2019 to February 16, 2020. Demographics, underlying diseases, and laboratory test results on admission were collected and analyzed. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS: The non-survivors were older (65.46 [SD 9.74]vs 46.23 [12.01]) and were more likely to have chronic medical illnesses. Non-survivors tend to develop more severe lymphopenia, with higher C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, D-dimer, and hs-Troponin I(hs-TnI) levels. Patients with elevated hs-TnI levels on admission had shorter duration from symptom onset to death. Increased hs-TnI level was related to dismal prognosis. Death risk increased by 20.8% when the hs-TnI level increased by one unit. After adjusting for inflammatory or coagulation index, the independent predictive relationship between hs-TnI and death disappeared.

On top of the ubiquitous challenges for all children, this public health crisis imparts unique difficulties for children with special health needs. We identify children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as being particularly vulnerable to negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we examine why children with ASD are uniquely vulnerable, recommend strategies to mitigate these stressors for children with ASD and their parents, explore the potential challenges of reintegration into society as conditions improve, and examine the obligations of healthcare and community stakeholders to support these families.","Bellomo, Tiffany R; Prasad, Sanjana; Munzer, Tiffany; Laventhal, Naomi",J Pediatr Rehabil Med,,636

404097,Management of skin damage of health workers' face: the role of plastic surgery in the time of Pandemic,2021,"Abstract Communication is a key factor in containing a pandemic. Fragmented information may affect people's perceptions and behaviors, especially in times of governmental miscommunication, potentially jeopardizing efforts aimed at containing the spread of the disease. To test whether and how people have been sensitive to broken information during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, we performed a randomized survey experiment on a sample of 571 respondents. We found that more pessimistic or more optimistic fragmented messages about the pandemic have no overall significant average effect on perceptions and planned behavior of the respondents. The exploratory analyses showed that particular sociodemographic groups are more sensitive to these fragmented messages. While less educated people react to more pessimistic messages with an increased likelihood to intensify prevention measures, people aged 60 or older - the high-risk group for COVID-19 complications - react to more optimistic messages with a reduced probability to intensify prevention measures. Besides providing insights to the public administration literature on disaster management, the results reinforce the need for governments to consistently centralize communication efforts to guarantee that people are equipped with complete and accurate information to form their perceptions and adequate their behaviors towards a health crisis.","Melo, Carolina; Cabral, Sandro",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,636

The spatial aspect of such data is also of primordial importance, as many infectious diseases are transmitted from one subject to another. In this paper, a spatially correlated frailty model is introduced that accommodates for the correlation between subjects based on the distance between them. Estimates are obtained through a stochastic approximation version of the Expectation Maximization algorithm combined with a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain, for which convergence is proven. The novelty of this model is that spatial correlation is introduced for survival data at the subject level, each subject having its own frailty. This univariate spatially correlated frailty model is used to analyze spatially dependent malaria data, and its results are compared with other standard models.","Oodally, Ajmal; Kuhn, Estelle; Goethals, Klara; Duchateau, Luc",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05504v1.pdf,636

The Lesson Learned in Italy in the Early Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"In the last few years, we have witnessed an important development in the medical field of both Mobile Health, such as the use of mobile communication devices, and other telemedicine tools in general, in order to support the surveillance of diseases from the moment of the first diagnosis to the therapeutic follow-up. Long before COVID-19, some authors had analyzed various possible evidence-based scenarios and had indicated how the use of telemedicine could prove to be extremely useful in epidemic situations, especially for the management of chronic patients, such as immune-allergic ones, who are notoriously in greater need of regular follow-up; however, as expected, the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the differences between various countries, from the point of view of the propensity to use technological solutions in the health sector. The hope is that one positive outcome of the ongoing pandemic is that it will lead to an acceleration, by all the stakeholders involved, of the process of modernization of health care.","Pattini, Stefano; Malizia, Velia; Travaglini, Alessandro; Brighetti, Maria Antonia; Della Giustina, Auro; Sfika, Ifigenia; Di Menno Di Bucchianico, Alessandro; Tripodi, Salvatore",Pediatr Allergy Immunol,,636

405381,Anxiety among Australian Nurses during COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 containment strategies created challenges with patient-centered ICU rounds. We examined how hybrid rounds with virtual communication added to in-person rounds could facilitate social distancing while maintaining patient-centered care. DESIGN: Continuous quality improvement. SETTING: Quaternary care referral pediatric hospital. PATIENTS: Daytime rounds conducted on PICU patients. INTERVENTIONS: Following a needs assessment survey and pilot trials, multiple technological solutions were implemented in a series of plan-do-study-act cycles. Hybrid rounds model was deployed where a videoconference platform was used to establish communication between the bedside personnel (nurse, patient/family, and partial ICU team) with remotely located remaining ICU team, ancillary, and consultant providers. Floor labels marking 6-feet distance were placed for rounders. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcome metrics included compliance with social distancing, mixed methods analysis of surveys, direct interviews of providers and families, and reports of safety concerns. The clinicians adopted hybrid rounds readily. Compliance with social distancing and use of floor labels needed reminders. One-hundred fourteen providers completed the feedback survey. Twenty-five providers and 11 families were interviewed. Feedback about hybrid rounds included inability to teach effectively, suboptimal audio-video quality, loss of situational awareness of patient/unit acuity, alarm interference, and inability to socially distance during other ICU interactions. Benefits noted were improved ancillary input, fewer interruptions, improved efficiency, opportunity to integrate with data platforms, and engage remote consultants and families. Nurses and families appreciated the efforts to ensure safety but wanted the ICU attending/fellow supervising the team to participate at bedside, during rounds. Clinicians appreciated the multidisciplinary input but felt that teaching was difficult. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid rounds employed during pandemic facilitated social distancing while retaining patient-centered multidisciplinary ICU rounds but compromised teaching during rounds. A change to ingrained rounding habits needs team commitment and ongoing optimization. The hybrid rounds model has potential for generalizability to other settings.","Bavare, Aarti C; Goldman, Jordana R; Musick, Matthew A; Sembera, Kerry A; Sardual, Alex A; Lam, Anne K; Tume, Sebastian C; Thammasitboon, Satid X; Williams, Eric A",Pediatric critical care medicine,,636
405720,The socioeconomic and environmental drivers of the COVID-19 pandemic: A review,2021,"The current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the approval of numerous molecular diagnostic assays with various performance and technical capacities. There are limited data comparing performance among assays. We conducted a retrospective analysis of >10,000 test results among three widely used RT-PCR assays for COVID-19 (CDC, Simplexa Direct, and TaqPath) to assess performance characteristics. We also re-tested remnant weakly positive specimens to assess analytical sensitivity. All assays had strong linear correlation and little bias among cycle threshold (Ct) values for PCR targets. In patients with first-test negative results (n=811), most (795, 98.0%) remained negative for all subsequent testing. Re-testing of weakly positive specimens (Ct>30) showed sensitivities as TaqPath (97.8%), CDC (91%), Simplexa (75.3%). Our analysis showed no performance difference among PCR targets within the same assay, suggesting a single target is sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens had higher negative predictive value (NPV) (100%) than upper respiratory tract specimens (98%), highlighting the utility of testing LRT specimens when clinically indicated. NPV did not increase upon further repeat testing, providing strong evidence for discouraging unnecessary repeat testing for SARS-CoV-2.","Price, Travis K; Bowland, Brian C; Chandrasekaran, Sukantha; Garner, Omai B; Yang, Shangxin",J. mol. diagn,,636
406610,Reopening schools in the context of increasing COVID-19 community transmission: The French experience,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Brain atrophy (BA) is often found in neuroimaging of hemodialysis patients, representing parenchymal cerebral damage. Likely contributing factors to BA are age, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular risk factors of atherosclerosis that are also common among hemodialysis patients. BA may also occur due to focal ischemia and hypoperfusion during hemodialysis. However, data on optimal blood pressure (BP) in these patients are limited. The goal of this study was to determine whether the prevalence and severity of BA would be higher among hemodialysis patients with lower BP. METHODS: A blinded neuroradiologist graded BA of all hemodialysis patients who underwent brain non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) from 2015 to 2017 in our institution. Age- and sex-matched patients with normal kidney function who underwent brain CT during the same period and technique served as the control group. RESULTS: A total of 280 patients were included in this retrospective study, with average BP of 140/70 mmHg among hemodialysis patients and 142/75 mmHg in the control group. BA was more common in dialysis patients and its severity increased with age and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. We observed a significant negative correlation between diastolic BP (DBP) at dialysis initiation and BA. Average DBP decreased with increasing severity of BA. These findings were observed in both hemodialysis and non-CKD patients. CONCLUSION: BA was associated with lower DBP, which may induce cerebral hypoperfusion and ischemia. This finding should discourage over-treatment of hypertension among hemodialysis patients. This article is protected by copyright.

408116,Optimizing Lessons Learned from COVID-19's Effects on School Nutrition Programs,2020,"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is initiated by virus binding to the ACE2 cell-surface receptors1-4, followed by fusion of the virus and cell membranes to release the virus genome into the cell. Both receptor binding and membrane fusion activities are mediated by the virus spike glycoprotein5-7. As with other class-I membrane-fusion proteins, the spike protein is post-translationally cleaved, in this case by furin, into the S1 and S2 components that remain associated after cleavage8-10. Fusion activation after receptor binding is proposed to involve the exposure of a second proteolytic site (S2'), cleavage of which is required for the release of the fusion peptide11,12. Here we analyse the binding of ACE2 to the furin-cleaved form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using cryo-electron microscopy. We classify ten different molecular species, including the unbound, closed spike trimer, the fully open ACE2-bound trimer and dissociated monomeric S1 bound to ACE2. The ten structures describe ACE2-binding events that destabilize the spike trimer, progressively opening up, and out, the individual S1 components. The opening process reduces S1 contacts and unshields the trimeric S2 core, priming the protein for fusion activation and dissociation of ACE2-bound S1 monomers. The structures also reveal refolding of an S1 subdomain after ACE2 binding that disrupts interactions with S2, which involves Asp61413-15 and leads to the destabilization of the structure of S2 proximal to the secondary (S2') cleavage site.","Benton, Donald J; Wrobel, Antoni G; Xu, Pengqi; Roustan, Chloë; Martin, Stephen R; Rosenthal, Peter B; Skehel, John J; Gamblin, Steven J",Nature (Lond.),,636

As inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease, and most patients are on long-term immunosuppressive agents, there is understandable concern, particularly in terms of therapy. In view of this, experts in IBD across the Asia Pacific region were invited to put together recommendations based on their experience and the currently available data. In general, most IBD therapies (with a few exceptions) can be continued safely, and the general consensus is that maintaining disease control should remain the main principle of management. In addition, social distancing measures and the appropriate use of personal protective equipment should be strictly adhered to. During the current pandemic, face-to-face clinic follow ups and non-urgent procedures should be kept to a minimum.","Ling, Khoon Lin; Hilmi, Ida; Raja Ali, Raja Affendi; Leong, Rupert W L; Leung, Wai Keung; Ng, Siew Chien; Wu, Kai Chun; Chen, Min Hu; Ran, Zhi Hua; Hisamatsu, Tadakazu; Ahuja, Vineet; Makharia, Govind K; Banerjee, Rupa; Wei, Shu Chen; Wu, Deng Chyang; Pisespongsa, Pises; Ye, Byong Duk; Sollano, Jose; Simadibrata, Marcellus; Chuah, Sai Wei; Ooi, Choon Jin",JGH Open,,636

METHODS: A total of 44 patients with COVID-19 (17 subjects in a critical group and 27 patients in a non-critical group) and 14 healthy controls, who were admitted to Hospitals in Babol, were recruited to the study. In subjects' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we compared the phenotype of CD8 T lymphocytes, expressing PD-1, TIM-3, or CD39, both alone and in various combinations. RESULTS: The findings showed that the percentage of CD8+ cells was significantly lower in patients. Critical and non-critical patients were more likely than healthy controls to have an escalated frequency of CD8+ TIM-3+, CD8+ CD39+, and CD8+ TIM-3+ CD39+ cells. No significant differences were observed between all groups in the CD8+ PD-1+ cell counts. There was also no difference between three groups regarding the counts of CD8+ TIM-3+ PD-1+, CD8+ PD-1+ CD39+, and CD8+ TIM-3+ PD-1+ CD39+ cells. The counts of non-exhausted cells were significantly lower in critical and non-critical individuals compared to the healthy individuals' value. CONCLUSION: Patients, infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), altered exhausted CD8 T lymphocytes with CD39 and TIM-3 exhaustion markers, which may account the dysregulated immune response found in COVID-19.","Shahbazi, Mehdi; Moulana, Zahra; Sepidarkish, Mahdi; Bagherzadeh, Mojgan; Rezanejad, Maryam; Mirzakhani, Mohammad; Jafari, Mohammad; Mohammadnia-Afrouzi, Mousa",Microb Pathog,,636

There is no information about the effects of tight glycemic control on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes in patients with hyperglycemia. Therefore, we examined the effects of optimal glycemic control in patients with hyperglycemia affected by COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with COVID-19 hospitalized with moderate disease were evaluated. On the basis of admission glycemia >7.77 mmol/L, patients were divided into hyperglycemic and normoglycemic groups. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and D-dimer levels were evaluated at admission and weekly during hospitalization. The composite end point was severe disease, admission to an intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: Thirty-four (57.6%) patients were normoglycemic and 25 (42.4%) were hyperglycemic. In the hyperglycemic group, 7 (28%) and 18 (72%) patients were diagnosed with diabetes already before admission, and 10 (40%) and 15 (60%) were treated without and with insulin infusion, respectively. The mean of glycemia during hospitalization was 10.65 ± 0.84 mmol/L in the no insulin infusion group and 7.69 ± 1.85 mmol/L in the insulin infusion group. At baseline, IL-6 and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in the hyperglycemic group than in the normoglycemic group (P < 0.001). Even though all patients were on standard treatment for COVID-19 infection, IL-6 and D-dimer levels persisted higher in patients with hyperglycemia during hospitalization. In a risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis, both patients with hyperglycemia and patients with diabetes had a higher risk of severe disease than those without diabetes and with normoglycemia. Cox regression analysis evidenced that patients with hyperglycemia treated with insulin infusion had a lower risk of severe disease than patients without insulin infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin infusion may be an effective method for achieving glycemic targets and improving outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","Sardu, Celestino; D039,; Onofrio, Nunzia; Balestrieri, Maria Luisa; Barbieri, Michelangela; Rizzo, Maria Rosaria; Messina, Vincenzo; Maggi, Paolo; Coppola, Nicola; Paolisso, Giuseppe; Marfella, Raffaele",Diabetes Care,,636

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 72 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the critical ward of Cancer Center of Union Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan from February to March in 2020. The patients were divided into two groups: moderate type (non-severe group) and severe/critical type (severe group). The results of white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEU), lymphocyte count (LYM), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and D-dimer were collected at the 2nd day after admission from the two groups, and the NLR was calculated. The diagnostic value of WBC, NEU, LYM, IL-6, D-dimer and NLR on COVID-19 classification was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: A total of 72 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, among whom 52 were moderate, 17 were severe, and 3 were critical. The most common clinical manifestations of patients were fever (70.8%), cough (36.1%), chest tightness and breathlessness (37.5%), diarrhea (15.3%), fatigue (15.3%), vomiting and nausea (11.1%), occasionally accompanied by acute dyspnea (2.8%), and only one patient had no clinical symptom (1.4%). The levels of WBC, NEU, IL-6, D-dimer and NLR in the severe group were significantly higher than those in the non-severe group [WBC (×109/L): 7.81±3.65 vs. 5.34±1.69, NEU (×109/L): 5.83±3.13 vs. 3.24±1.53, IL-6 (ng/L): 133.63 (71.09, 249.61) vs. 28.05 (6.41, 101.24), D-dimer (mg/L): 0.86 (0.31, 2.56) vs. 0.33 (0.20, 0.71), NLR: 6.14±4.75 vs. 2.66±1.93, all P < 0.05], and the level of LYM was significantly lower than that in the non-severe group (×109/L: 1.09±0.56 vs. 1.49±0.74, P < 0.05). The results of ROC curve analysis showed that the areas under ROC curve (AUC) of WBC, NEU, LYM, IL-6, D-dimer and NLR for COVID-19 classification were 0.790 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.684-0.897), 0.869 (95%CI was 0.789-0.949), 0.719 (95%CI was 0.592-0.847), 0.790 (95%CI was 0.682-0.898), 0.676 (95%CI was 0.526-0.827), and 0.888 (95%CI was 0.814-0.963) respectively. The AUC of NLR was the highest, which was of high diagnostic value; when the optimum cut-off value of NLR was 3.00, the sensitivity was 100%, and the specificity was 73.1%. CONCLUSIONS: NLR can be used as a biomarker to predict classification of COVID-19 patients independently, which can provide a theoretical basis for the classification management of COVID-19 patients.","Fei, Mingming; Tong, Fei; Tao, Xiaogen; Wang, Jinquan",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,,636

413344,Digestive symptoms and COVID-19: Importance of ruling out associated surgical pathology,2021,"[...]the pandemic also threatens to worsen neoliberal structures that have taken advantage of crisis points in the past, as many public sectors, such as local government and education, lose a massive amount of state funding and millions lose their jobs.2 Meanwhile, the wealthiest capitalize on emerging social needs, having increased their collective net worth by $637 billion since March.3 One sector where the endoskeleton has revealed itself is the lowwage healthcare sector, inseparable from domestic work in nursing homes, care facilities, and private residences. Significantly less attention has been given to the lowest-paid and most highly exploited healthcare workers, such as nursing and housekeeping staff at nursing homes and other care facilities as well as care laborers and health aides in private residences.4 These undervalued sectors of the healthcare industry are predominated by black women and other women of color, often immigrants. Black healthcare workers in general are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, and the vulnerability of home health aides and domestic workers is compounded by the fact that, when privately employed, they are often uninsured.5 Vulnerability to COVID-19 is determined not only by age and health status, but also by race and class independent of these other factors, with black and Indigenous people dying of the illness at rates five times higher than white people.6 In line with general trends, black healthcare workers are dying at the highest rates. A recent jama study confirms that in addition to the usual stressors, long hours, and little pay, home healthcare workers are particularly stressed and overlooked in the COVID-19 pandemic, given little to no preparation or personal protective equipment, and experiencing high rates of infection.13 Still, many report feeling con- cerned about the possibility of being unable to return to work.","Alomar, Maisam",Feminist Studies,,636

All specialities have changed their way of working during the pandemic. In this study, we evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on the practice of interventional pulmonology at our centre. All interventional pulmonology procedures done during the three months after implementation of lockdown were evaluated retrospectively for patient demographics, clinical diagnosis, indication for procedure and diagnostic accuracy. The changes in practices, additional human resources requirement, the additional cost per procedure and impact on resident training were also assessed. Procedures done during the month of January 2020 were used as controls for comparison. Twenty-two flexible bronchoscopies (75.8%), four semirigid thoracoscopies (13.7%) and three EBUS-TBNAs (10.3%) were carried out during three month lockdown period as compared to 174 during January 2020. Twenty-three of the procedures were for the diagnostic indication (79%), and six were therapeutic (20.6%). The diagnostic yield in suspected neoplasm was 100% while for suspected infections was 58.3%. The percentage of independent procedures being done by residents reduced from 45.4% to 0%. The workforce required per procedure increased from 0.75 to 4-8, and the additional cost per procedure came out to be 135 USD. To conclude, COVID 19 has impacted the interventional pulmonology services in various ways and brought about a need to reorganize the services, while also thinking of innovative ideas to reduce cost without compromising patient safety.","Tyagi, Rahul; Mittal, Saurabh; Madan, Karan; Mohan, Anant; Hadda, Vijay; Tiwari, Pawan; Guleria, Randeep",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,636
413715,Adaptation of the Cuban version of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused over one million deaths worldwide, thus there is an urgent need to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies. The anti-tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) demonstrates non-specific protective innate immune-boosting effects. Here, we determined if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion in a retrospective observational study of a diverse cohort of health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: We assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and collected medical questionnaires, including BCG vaccination status and pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics, from an observational cohort of HCWs in a multi-site Los Angeles healthcare organization. We used multi-variate analysis to estimate if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion. RESULTS: Of the 6,201 HCWs, 29.6% reported a history of BCG vaccination whereas 68.9% did not receive BCG vaccination. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG as well as incidence of self-reported clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 were significantly decreased among HCWs with a history of BCG vaccination compared to those without BCG vaccination. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that history of BCG vaccination, but not meningococcal, pneumococcal or influenza vaccination, was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS: History of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and reduced reported COVID-19-related clinical symptoms in this cohort of HCWs. Therefore, large randomized prospective clinical trials of BCG vaccination are urgently needed to confirm if BCG vaccination can induced a protective effect against SARS-CoV2 infection. FUNDING: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (U54 CA26059) and the Erika J. Glazer Family Foundation. Key words: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, BCG, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, healthcare workers, trained immunity.","Noval Rivas, Magali; Ebinger, Joseph E; Wu, Min; Sun, Nancy; Braun, Jonathan; Sobhani, Kimia; Van Eyk, Jennifer E; Cheng, Susan; Arditi, Moshe",J. clin. invest,,636

There is an urgent need to develop a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Currently, several strategies are being pursued to develop a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, each vaccine strategy has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, it is important to evaluate multiple vaccine platforms to select the most efficient vaccine platform for SARS-CoV-2. In this regard, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian virus, has several well-suited properties for development of a vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we elaborate on the idea of considering NDV as a vaccine vector for SARS-CoV-2.","Shirvani, Edris; Samal, Siba K.",Pathogens,,636

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed to assess if sex differences exist in the clinical manifestations and transitions of care among hospitalized individuals dying with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italy (February 27-June 11, 2020). Clinical characteristics and the times from symptoms' onset to admission, nasopharyngeal swab, and death were compared between sexes. Adjusted multivariate analysis was performed to identify the clinical features associated with male sex. RESULTS: Of the 32,938 COVID-19-related deaths that occurred in Italy, 3517 hospitalized and deceased individuals with COVID-19 (mean 78 ± 12 years, 33% women) were analyzed. At admission, men had a higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease (adj-OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.39-2.23), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (adj-OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.29-2.27), and chronic kidney disease (adj-OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.13-1.96), while women were older and more likely to have dementia (adj-OR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.95) and autoimmune diseases (adj-OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.25-0.63), yet both sexes had a high level of multimorbidity. The times from symptoms' onset to admission and nasopharyngeal swab were slightly longer in men despite a typical acute respiratory illness with more frequent fever at the onset. Men received more often experimental therapy (adj-OR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.45-5.74) and experienced more likely acute kidney injury (adj-OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.13-1.90). CONCLUSIONS: Men and women dying with COVID-19 had different clinical manifestations and transitions of care.

Some drugs are underway or being used to combat this disease. Several proteins of the virus can be targeted in therapeutic approaches. Two structural proteins, membrane (M), envelope (E) have critical roles in virus life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation and pathogenesis. Here, we employed the in silico strategies to identify and evaluate the selected potential compounds against M and E proteins. For this, the structures of proteins were modeled and then several groups of compounds as FDA approved, natural products or under clinical trials were screened from DrugBank and ZINC databases. The selected dockings were analyzed and the ligands with best binding affinity scores were subjected to evaluate drug-likeness and medicinal chemistry friendliness through prediction of ADMET properties. Normal mode analyses were also performed for six selected complexes to explore the collective motions of proteins. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was also performed to calculate the stability of two docked protein–ligand complexes. The results revealed that several compounds had high affinity to the proteins along with some acceptable profiles of mobility and deformability, especially, for M protein. The aim of this study was finding the potential compounds with inhibitory effect on membrane and envelope proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and according to the results several compounds especially some FDA-approved drugs and natural compounds shown that can be applied as hit compounds against these structural proteins of the virus.

415928,COVID-19 Pandemic – A Review with a Dental Perspective,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Information from critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is limited and in many cases coming from health systems approaches different from the national public systems existing in most countries in Europe. Besides, patient follow-up remains incomplete in many publications. Our aim is to characterize acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients admitted to a medical critical care unit (MCCU) in a referral hospital in Spain. DESIGN: Retrospective case series of consecutive ARDS COVID-19 patients admitted and treated in our MCCU. SETTING: 36-bed MCCU in referral tertiary hospital. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal/pharyngeal swabs. INTERVENTIONS: None MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Demographic and clinical data were collected, including data on clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality. RESULTS: Forty-four ARDS COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Median age was 61.50 (53.25 - 67) years and most of the patients were male (72.7%). Hypertension and dyslipidemia were the most frequent co-morbidities (52.3 and 36.4% respectively). Steroids (1mg/Kg/day) and tocilizumab were administered in almost all patients (95.5%). 77.3% of the patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 16 days [11-28]. Prone position ventilation was performed in 33 patients (97%) for a median of 3 sessions [2-5] per patient. Nosocomial infection was diagnosed in 13 patients (29.5%). Tracheostomy was performed in ten patients (29.4%). At study closing all patients had been discharged from the CCU and only two (4.5%) remained in hospital ward. MCCU length of stay was 18 days [10-27]. Mortality at study closing was 20.5% (n 9); 26.5% among ventilated patients. CONCLUSIONS: The seven-week period in which our MCCU was exclusively dedicated to COVID-19 patients has been challenging. Despite the severity of the patients and the high need for invasive mechanical ventilation, mortality was 20.5%.","Ramírez, P; Gordón, M; Martín-Cerezuela, M; Villarreal, E; Sancho, E; Padrós, M; Frasquet, J; Leyva, G; Molina, I; Barrios, M; Gimeno, S; Castellanos, Á","Med. intensiva (Madr., Ed. impr.)",,636

As the burden of the disease escalates, routine elective surgeries are being cancelled. The aim of this paper was to provide a guideline for management of endocrine surgical disorders during a pandemic. METHODS: We used Delphi method with a nine-scale Likert scale on two rounds of voting involving 64 experienced eminent surgeons and endocrinologists who had the necessary experience to provide insight on endocrine disorder management. All voting was done by email using a standard questionnaire. RESULTS: Overall, 37 recommendations were voted on. In two rounds, all recommendations reached an agreement and were either endorsed or rejected. Endorsed statements include dietary change in primary hyperparathyroidism, Cinacalcet treatment in secondary hyperparathyroidism, alpha-blocker administration for pheochromocytoma, methimazole ± ß-blocker combination for Graves' disease, and follow-up for fine-needle aspiration results of thyroid nodules indicated as Bethesda 3-4 cytological results and papillary microcarcinoma. CONCLUSION: This survey summarizes expert opinion for the management of endocrine surgical conditions during unprecedented times when access to surgical treatment is severely disrupted. The statements are not applicable in circumstances in which surgical treatment is possible.","Agcaoglu, Orhan; Sezer, Atakan; Makay, Ozer; Erdogan, Murat Faik; Bayram, Fahri; Guldiken, Sibel; Raffaelli, Marco; Sonmez, Yusuf Alper; Lee, Yong-Sang; Vamvakidis, Kyriakos; Mihai, Radu; Duh, Quan-Yang; Akinci, Baris; Alagol, Faruk; Almquist, Martin; Barczynski, Marcin; Bayraktaroglu, Taner; Berber, Eren; Bukey, Yusuf; Cakmak, Guldeniz Karadeniz; Canturk, Nuh Zafer; Canturk, Zeynep; Celik, Mehmet; Celik, Ozlem; Ceyhan, Banu Ozturk; Cherenko, Sergii; Clerici, Thomas; Coombes, David Scott; Demircan, Orhan; Deyneli, Oguzhan; Dionigi, Gianlorenzo; Emre, Ali Ugur; Erbil, Yesim; Filiz, Ali Ilker; Gozu, Hulya Iliksu; Gurdal, Sibel Ozkan; Gurleyik, Gunay; Haciyanli, Mehmet; Kebudi, Abut; Kim, Seokmo; Koutelidakis, Giannis; Kuru, Bekir; Mert, Meral; Oruk, Guzide Gonca; Ozbas, Serdar; Palazzo, Fausto; Pandev, Rumen; Riss, Phillip; Sabuncu, Tevfik; Sahin, Ibrahim",Updates surg.

Like most members of this family, the virus is composed of structural and non-structural proteins (NSPs). The non-structural proteins are critical elements of the replication and transcription complex (RTC), as well as immune system evasion. Through hijacking the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, NSPs help the virus establish the RTC, inducing ER stress after membrane rearrangement and causing severe neuronal disturbance. In this review, we focus on the role of Nsp3, 4, and 6 in intracellular membrane rearrangement and evaluate the potential disruption of the central nervous system and the neurodegeneration which it could trigger. Studies of these NSPs will not only bring to light their specific role in viral infection but also facilitate the discovery of novel targeted drugs.","Santerre, Maryline; Arjona, Sterling P; Allen, Charles Ns; Shcherbik, Natalia; Sawaya, Bassel E",J. neurol,,636

418283,Role of Teledentistry in COVID-19 Pandemic: A Nationwide Comparative Analysis among Dental Professionals,2020,"In case of oncological disease there is a deterioration of patients' quality of life as such of its characteristics as physiological, psychological, emotional and social decrease These problems are especially worsened by additional threats of social life Today, such a challenge to the health of all mankind, and especially cancer patients, is the global pandemic caused by the spread of coronavirus disease COVID-19 Fear of death and loss of loved ones, isolation, economic shock and uncertainty about the future -- all this certainly affects the quality of life, especially for patients after mastectomy, because they were already in emotional and physiological stress The problem of determining the patients' quality of life after mastectomy and correcting the nature of the personal reaction to the disease in the coronavirus pandemic is an integral part of the physical rehabilitation programme The objective of the study: to assess the quality of life and effectiveness of physical rehabilitation programmes of women after mastectomy in the conditions of pandemic COVID-19 Research methods The study involved 36 women aged from 42-69, who underwent radical mastectomy and were receiving adjuvant treatment at the Kherson Regional Oncological Center To restore their health, the patients passed an author's programme of physical therapy for people after radical mastectomy The methodology of building the author's programme was based on continuity, phasing and its implementation both in the mammology department and at home The quality of life parameters and the volume indicators of mobility of the joints of the upper extremity were evaluated by the operated part before the application of physical therapy methods (early hospital period), after physical therapy (late hospital period) and after discharge from a hospital, but women continued to perform rehabilitation measures independently and were at home during the COVID-19 pandemic (posthospital period + quarantine) To assess the quality of life, we used the questionnaire ""MOS SF-36"", which was used at each stage of rehabilitation Research results Based on the conducted goniometry of women after radical mastectomy, it can be concluded that the amplitude of movements in the shoulder joint differs significantly at all periods of physical therapy (early hospital period, late hospital period and post-hospital period + quarantine) from the standard indicators Extension of the shoulder among most women after the application of an individual rehabilitation programme has fully recovered, forced quarantine and lack of general physical activity did not affect this indicator Independent performance of therapeutic gymnastics (in the post-hospital period + quarantine) did not significantly improve this indicator and did not lead to complete recovery of movement The analysis of the obtained results showed that among women, who underwent mastectomy under the influence of physical exercises, already in the late hospital period of rehabilitation, there was not only an improvement in joint mobility, but there was an improvement in quality of life At the same time, women in the post-hospital period of physical rehabilitation, which coincided with the quarantine period, there was a slight decrease in quality of life Namely: there was a decrease in physical activity (PF) by 4 5%, which indicated a decrease in daily physical activity;it was found that the role of physical problems in the limitation of vital functions (RF) decreased by 2 7% (this indicator reflected the impact of physical condition on daily role activities) Low RF values indicate that daily activities are significantly limited by the patient's physical condition;women noted an increase in pain indicator (BP) by 9 6% and its effect on the ability to engage in daily activities, which led to limited activity of patients;deterioration of mental health (MH) -- by 3 8%, which was characterized by low mood, depression, anxiety and a decrease in the overall rate of positive emotions Low scores indicated the presence of depres ive, anxious experience and mental distress;decrease of the indicator of role functioning, which is due to emotional state (RE), during forced quarantine by 13 6%, interpreted as a restriction in the performance of daily work, which is due to the deterioration of emotional state;vital activity parameters (VT) decreased during quarantine by 11 7% The obtained indicators testified to higher fatigue of patients, decrease of their vital activity and decrease of their vivacity Conclusions Quarantine conditions and self-isolation, which appeared during the spread of coronavirus disease, are an additional source of concern for patients after mastectomy and have identified a decline in their quality of life and the effectiveness of physical therapy in general Although before the quarantine measures, the indicators of quality of life and mobility of the shoulder joints on the operated side were significantly increased under the influence of the physical therapy programme for this category of patients Assessment of the quality of life of patients after mastectomy is an integral characteristic of physical, mental, social and spiritual condition, which allows determining the effectiveness of physical rehabilitation measures Therefore, the assessment of the life quality of women after mastectomy, which is made by the patients themselves, is a secure and reliable indicator of their general condition under normal conditions and during the pandemic period of coronavirus disease The obtained data on the quality of life allow for constant monitoring of the patients' general condition after undergoing surgery on the mammary, as well as timely, if necessary, to adjust the physical therapy programme [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

However, the cleavage sites of 3CLpro and their relevant nsps remain unclear, which is the subject of this perspective. Here, we address the subject from three standpoints. First, we explore the inconsistency in the cleavage sites and relevant nsps across CoVs, and investigate the function of nsp11. Second, we consider the nsp16 mRNA overlapping of the spike protein mRNA, and analyze the effect of this overlapping on mRNA vaccines. Finally, we study nsp12, whose existence depends on ribosomal frameshifting, and investigate whether 3CLpro requires a large number of inhibitors to achieve full inhibition. This perspective helps us to clarify viral replication and is useful for developing anti-CoV drugs with 3CLpro as a target in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Yan, Shaomin; Wu, Guang",FASEB J,,636

418710,Mitigating ethnic disparities in covid-19 and beyond: census linkage can help tackle the data deficit,2021,"We hypothesized that visits to green and blue spaces may have enabled respite, connection and exercise during the COVID-19 pandemic, but such benefits might have been inequitably distributed due to differences in financial difficulties, opportunities to work from home, and localized restrictions in spatial mobility generated by 'lockdowns'. A nationally representative online and telephone survey conducted in 12-26 October on the Social Research Centre's Life in AustraliaTM panel (aged &#8805; 18 y, 78.8% response, N = 3043) asked about access, visitation, and felt benefits from green and/or blue spaces. Increasing financial difficulty was associated with less time in and fewer visits to green and/or blue spaces, as well as fewer different types visited. Financial difficulty was also associated with feelings that visits to green and/or blue space had less benefit for maintaining social connection. Working from home was associated with more frequent and longer visitation to green and/or blue spaces, as well as discovery of ones previously unvisited. Working from home was also associated with increased levels of exercise and respite resulting from visits to green and/or blue spaces. Residents of Melbourne, a city of 4.9 million who were in 'lockdown' at the time of the survey, appeared more likely to benefit from visits to green and/or blue spaces than residents of Sydney, Australia's largest city at 5.2 million, who were not in lockdown. Residents of Melbourne compared with Sydney reported consistently increased visitation of, discovery of, and greater levels of various felt benefits derived from green and/or blue spaces, including more respite, connection, and exercise. Comparatively shorter distances to preferred green and/or blue spaces and closure of alternative settings at the time of the survey completion in Melbourne compared with Sydney may provide partial explanation, though more acute responses to experiencing green and/or blue spaces within highly cognitively demanding antecedent conditions posed by lockdown are also plausible and warrant further investigation with other health indicators. These results were robust to adjustment for a range of covariates including preferences for natural settings, which were consistently associated with greater levels of green and/or blue space visitation and felt benefits. Collectively, these results indicate that parallel efforts to generate (or renew) felt connection to natural settings, to increase working from home opportunities, and to mitigate financial difficulties may be important to help maximize the population health benefits of urban planning strategies intended to improve the availability of, and to reduce inequities in access to, green and blue spaces. Benefits felt more commonly by people living through lockdown underlines the role previous investments in green and blue space have played in enabling coping during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Astell-Burt, Thomas; Feng, Xiaoqi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,636

At pediatric ages, especially newborns, symptoms from other organ systems without respiratory illness could make COVID-19 hard to diagnose. We are reporting three cases of newborns who were attended in the course of the mitigation phase in the emergency service of a maternal hospital in Barranquilla, Colombia, for high temperature and general compromised condition. During their clinical course, they developed gastrointestinal symptoms without showing any respiratory manifestations. They were not epidemiologically linked to a contact suspected to be a COVID-19 case and their mothers had had no respiratory symptoms since the public health emergency in our country was declared 45 days before. The absence of clinical respiratory manifestations in this group of patients with COVID-19 should draw clinicians' attention to the need to suspect SARS CoV-2 infection in febrile newborns.","Baquero, Hernando; Venegas Martinez, María Elena; Velandia Forero, Lorena; Neira Safi, Fredy; Navarro Lechuga, Edgar",Biomedica,,636

Since emission intensity varies greatly between different foods, changing food choices towards those with lower GHGE could make an important contribution to mitigating climate change. Public engagement events offer an opportunity to communicate these multifaceted issues and raise awareness about the climate change impact of food choices. An interdisciplinary team of researchers was preparing food and climate change educational activities for summer 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown disrupted these plans. In this paper, we report on shifting these events online over the month of June 2020. We discuss what we did and the reception to our online programme.

420359,The Perceived Impact of COVID-19 on Comfort Food Consumption over Time: The Mediational Role of Emotional Distress,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is responsible for a global pandemic and many deaths. This context requires an adaptation of health systems as well as the role of each healthcare professional, including physiotherapists. STATE OF THE ART: In order to optimize the management of people with COVID-19, many savant societies published guidelines about physiotherapy interventions within the crisis but none offered a global overview from the intensive care unit to home care. Therefore, the aim of this review is to offer an overview of recommended physiotherapy interventions in order to facilitate the management of these patients, whatever the stage of the disease. PERSPECTIVES: Owing to the emergent character of the COVID-19, actual guidelines will have to be adjusted according to the evolution of the pandemic and the resources of the hospital and liberal sectors, in particular for the long-term follow-up of these patients. Current and future research will aim to assess the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions for people with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The emergence of COVID-19 required a very rapid adaptation of the health system. The role of physiotherapists is justified at every stage of patients care in order to limit the functional consequences of the disease.","Smondack, P; Gravier, F-É; Prieur, G; Repel, A; Muir, J-F; Cuvelier, A; Combret, Y; Medrinal, C; Bonnevie, T",Rev Mal Respir,,636
420672,COVID-19: Threat and fear in Indonesia,2020,"Originated in China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)- the highly contagious and fatal respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has already infected more than 29 million people worldwide with a mortality rate of 3.15% (according to World Health Organization's (WHO's) report, September 2020) and the number is exponentially increasing with no remedy whatsoever discovered till date. But it is not the first time this infectious viral disease has appeared, in 2002 SARS-CoV infected more than 8000 individuals of which 9.6% patients died and in 2012 approximately 35% of MERS-CoV infected patients have died. Literature reports indicate that a chymotripsin-like cystein protease (3CLpro) is responsible for the replication of the virus inside the host cell. Therefore, design and synthesis of 3CLpro inhibitor molecules play a great impact in drug development against this COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we are discussing the anti-SARS effect of some small molecule 3CLpro inhibitors with their various binding modes of interactions to the target protein.","Konwar, Manashjyoti; Sarma, Diganta",Tetrahedron,,636

So far postmortem CT (PMCT) has not been used as a screening instrument for the evaluation of deaths with and without autopsy. In this respect, its validity has to be proved in comparison to clinical-radiological experiences. STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: Postmortem CT METHODICAL INNOVATIONS: So far, PMCT can be regarded as a methodological innovation that has not yet been sufficiently evaluated for pneumonia. PERFORMANCE: CT in clinical routine has a high sensitivity for pneumonia. However, to what extent postmortem artifacts are relevant to PMCT still has to be determined. ACHIEVEMENTS: There is still no standard procedure for the postmortem radiological diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Despite postmortem artifacts, PMCT can provide valuable information about the presence of pneumonia with interstitial character, especially without autopsy. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: PMCT is particularly useful in the assessment of suspected cases of COVID-19 pneumonia for morphological assessment in the context of monitoring deaths in the current pandemic situation.","Kniep, I; Lutter, M; Ron, A; Edler, C; Püschel, K; Ittrich, H; Heller, M; Heinemann, A",Radiologe,,636
421459,Psychological factors associated with the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among nurses working in health sectors in Saudi Arabia,2021,"BACKGROUND: Each year there are more than 800,000 deaths by suicide across the world, while India alone accounts for one third of female suicides and one fourth of male suicides worldwide. Responsible media reporting of suicide is an important suicide prevention intervention at the population level. There is sufficient evidence to show that the way suicide is reported and portrayed in the media can have a significant impact on individuals experiencing suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Recognizing the important role of the media in suicide prevention, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued guidelines for responsible reporting of suicides by the media. The Press Council of India, in 2019 endorsed WHO's guidelines for media reporting of suicides, however there is no evidence that the Indian media is complying with these guidelines. METHODS: To encourage responsible media reporting, we developed a scorecard to assess and rate media reports on suicide. We reviewed several resource documents that contained guidelines on responsible reporting of suicide. After consulting with a team of experts, we arrived at a scorecard that consisted of 10 positive and 10 negative parameters. RESULTS: We applied the scorecard to 1318 reports on suicide from 9 English language newspapers, with the highest readership in India between the dates of 1 April to 30 June 2020. For the articles analyzed, the average positive score across all newspapers was 1.32 and the average negative score was 3.31. DISCUSSION: The scorecard can be a useful tool to assess media reports on suicide and provide metrics for the same. It can facilitate improved monitoring and engagement with media organizations, who can quickly check their own reporting compliance to the WHO guidelines and compare how well they are performing compared to their peers over time.","Vijayakumar, Lakshmi; Shastri, Manisha; Fernandes, Tanya Nicole; Bagra, Yash; Pathare, Aaryaman; Patel, Arpita; Jain, Padam; Merchant, Yesha; Armstrong, Gregory; Pathare, Soumitra",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,636

METHODS: This study analyzed transplant outcomes during the pre-pandemic [PPE, 1/2019-2/2020] and pandemic era [PE, 3/2020-8/2020] based on changes in induction immunosuppression. During PPE, high immunological risk patients received 4-6 mg/kg, moderate risk 2-4mg/kg, and low risk 1-2 mg/kg of ATG. During PE, ATG doses were reduced to 3-4 mg/kg for high risk, 1-2 mg/kg for moderate, and low changed to basiliximab. Primary outcomes: biopsy-proven rejection [BPAR], de-novo donor-specific antibody [DSA], delayed graft function [DGF], infection rates, graft loss, and all-cause of mortality. RESULTS: During PPE, 224 kidney transplants [KTx], 14 kidney/pancreas transplants [KP] were included, while 180 KTx, 5 KP were included for PE. Basiliximab use increased by 30% in the PE. The odds of DGF were statistically significant between PE vs PPE, OR 1.7 [1.05, 2.8, p-value=0.042]. The odds of developing DSAs and BPAR during the PE versus PPE was 0.34 [0.16, 0.71, p-value = 0.004] and OR 0.34 (0.1 to 1.1, p-value, 0.104)] respectively. Cytomegalovirus [19% in PE, 37% in PPE] and BK virus [5.4% PE vs. 16% PPE] incidence reduced during PE versus PPE. COVID-19, graft loss, and mortality were comparable between groups. CONCLUSION: KTx and KP transplants were performed safely during the COVID-19 pandemic with a reduction of induction immunosuppression.","Von Stein, Lauren; Witkowsky, Olya; Samidurai, Lakshmi; Doraiswamy, Mohan; Flores, Karen; Pesavento, Todd E; Singh, Priyamvada",Clin Transplant,,636

The role of anticoagulation (AC) at therapeutic (tAC) or prophylactic doses (pAC) is unclear. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the impact on survival of different AC doses in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Retrospective, multi-center cohort study of consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 13 and May 5, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 3480 patients were included (mean age, 64.5 years [17.0]; 51.5% female; 52.1% black and 40.6% white). 18.5% (n = 642) required intensive care unit (ICU) stay. 60.9% received pAC (n = 2121), 28.7% received &#8805;3 days of tAC (n = 998), and 10.4% (n = 361) received no AC. Propensity score (PS) weighted Kaplan-Meier plot demonstrated different 25-day survival probability in the tAC and pAC groups (57.5% vs 50.7%). In a PS-weighted multivariate proportional hazards model, AC was associated with reduced risk of death at prophylactic (hazard ratio [HR] 0.35 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.22-0.54]) and therapeutic doses (HR 0.14 [95% CI 0.05-0.23]) compared to no AC. Major bleeding occurred more frequently in tAC patients (81 [8.1%]) compared to no AC (20 [5.5%]) or pAC (46 [2.2%]) subjects.

424055,How COVID-19 deepens child oral health inequities,2020,"The global coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated lockdown restrictions resulted in the majority of sports competitions around the world being put on hold. This includes the National Basketball Association, the UEFA Champions League, Australian Football League, the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, and regional competitions. The mitigation strategies in place to control the pandemic have caused disruption to daily schedules, working environments, and lifestyle factors. Athletes rely on regular access to training facilities, practitioners, and coaches to maintain physical and mental health to achieve maximal performance and optimal recovery. Furthermore, participation in sport at any level increases social engagement and promotes better mental health. It is, therefore, critical to understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures have affected the lives of athletes. We surveyed elite and sub-elite athletes (n = 565) across multiple sports. Significant disruptions were reported for all lifestyle factors including social interactions, physical activity, sleep patterns, and mental health. We found a significant increase in total sleep time and sleep latency, as well as a delay in mid-sleep times and a decrease in social jetlag. Training frequency and duration significantly decreased. Importantly, the changes to training and sleep-related factors were associated with mental health outcomes. With spikes in COVID-19 cases rising around the world and governments reinstituting lockdowns (e.g. United Kingdom; Melbourne, Australia; California, USA) these results will inform messaging and strategies to better manage sleep and mental health in a population for whom optimal performance is critical.","Facer-Childs, Elise R; Hoffman, Daniel; Tran, Jennie N; Drummond, Sean P A; Rajaratnam, Shantha M W",Sleep,,636

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) has been considered the main receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells, and they are known to be present not only in lungs (therefore the common viral pneumonia) but also in nasopharyngeal mucosa, salivary cells and oral epithelial cells. Moreover, there seems to be recent evidence showing that the crevicular fluid on the periodontal pockets of patients presenting periodontitis could harbor SARS-CoV-2 and act as a potential reservoir for increased viral load in the oral cavity of COVID-positive patients. Additionally, sites with active periodontal disease might contribute for virus binding and tissue infection due to elevated expression of furin and cathepsin L proteases, which play a major role in enabling the SARS-CoV-2 to bind ACE-2 receptors and facilitating endosomal fusion in the host cells. Taken together this news and views article highlight possible virus reservoirs in COVID-positive patients, as well as increased risk for infection in patients with active periodontal disease, further proposing potential targets for antiviral intervention on SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bertolini, Martinna; Pita, Afroditi; Koo, Sungeun; Cardenas, Anibal; Meethil, Archana",Pesqui. bras. odontopediatria clín. integr,,636

DESIGN: Repeated cross-sectional survey. Between 17 July and 10 September 2020, mother-child pairs who were enrolled in a population-based survey in 2017 were re-contacted by telephone for consent and to complete a telephonic COVID-19 survey. We used the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale to assess food security and the Self Reporting Questionnaire-20 to assess MMD. McNemar's test for paired data that also accounted for clustering was used. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship of unemployment and receipt of government assistance with food insecurity and MMD in 2020. SETTING: Ceará, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred and seventy-seven mother-child pairs completed the 2017 and 2020 surveys. At the time of the 2020 interview, the child cohort was 36-108 months of age. RESULTS: The proportion of mothers reporting food insecurity was 15·5 % higher (95 % CI 5·9, 25·1, P value < 0·001) during the pandemic in July-August 2020 as compared with November 2017, while the prevalence of MMD was 40·2 % higher during the pandemic (95 % CI 32·6, 47·8, P value < 0·001). Loss of formal employment was associated with increased risk of food insecurity, but not with the risk of MMD.

425521,"Face Mask Use Among Commercial Drivers During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Accra, Ghana",2021,"BACKGROUND: Stressful events due to the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are likely to have profound effects on mental health, and validated methods for assessing these experiences and associations with psychopathology are needed. We developed the Pandemic Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and tested its psychometric properties, characterized experiences in emerging adults, and examined associations with internalizing symptoms. METHODS: Emerging adults (N = 450) completed the PSQ and measures of internalizing symptoms and perceived stress through an online platform in May 2020. One month later, 288 participants completed a follow-up questionnaire to assess reliability of the PSQ and longitudinal associations between stress and internalizing symptoms. RESULTS: Results supported the validity/reliability of PSQ total scores and indicated that stressful events were highly prevalent in May, particularly among younger, female, and Black emerging adults. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were high overall, but decreased at the follow-up assessment. Pandemic-related stress was moderately associated with both depression and anxiety at each assessment, but baseline stress did not predict change in symptoms when controlling for baseline symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide empirical evidence that emerging adults are at high risk for depression and anxiety related to the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlight specific types of experiences associated with greatest risk. Further, this study provides support for a questionnaire measure of experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic that can be applied in future work to advance understanding of risk and resilience in response to stressful events.","Kujawa, Autumn; Green, Haley; Compas, Bruce E; Dickey, Lindsay; Pegg, Samantha",Depress Anxiety,,636
425762,"Costs and benefits of early response in the COVID-19 outbreak in Cameroon: DALYs, treatment cost and labour supply lost",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many hospitals severely limiting or denying parents access to their hospitalised children. This article provides guidance for hospital managers, healthcare staff, district-level managers and provincial managers on parental access to hospitalised children during a pandemic such as COVID-19. It: (i) summarises legal and ethical issues around parental visitation rights; (ii) highlights four guiding principles; (iii) provides 10 practical recommendations to facilitate safe parental access to hospitalised children; (iv) highlights additional considerations if the mother is COVID-19-positive; and (v) provides considerations for fathers. In summary, it is a child's right to have access to his or her parents during hospitalisation, and parents should have access to their hospitalised children; during an infectious disease pandemic such as COVID-19, there is a responsibility to ensure that parental visitation is implemented in a reasonable and safe manner. Separation should only occur in exceptional circumstances, e.g. if adequate in-hospital facilities do not exist to jointly accommodate the parent/caregiver and the newborn/infant/child. Both parents should be allowed access to hospitalised children, under strict infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and with implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including handwashing/sanitisation, face masks and physical distancing. Newborns/infants and their parents/caregivers have a reasonably high likelihood of having similar COVID-19 status, and should be managed as a dyad rather than as individuals. Every hospital should provide lodger/boarder facilities for mothers who are COVID-19-positive, COVID-19-negative or persons under investigation (PUI), separately, with stringent IPC measures and NPIs. If facilities are limited, breastfeeding mothers should be prioritised, in the following order: (i) COVID-19-negative; (ii) COVID-19 PUI; and (iii) COVID-19-positive. Breastfeeding, or breastmilk feeding, should be promoted, supported and protected, and skin-to-skin care of newborns with the mother/caregiver (with IPC measures) should be discussed and practised as far as possible. Surgical masks should be provided to all parents/caregivers and replaced daily throughout the hospital stay. Parents should be referred to social services and local community resources to ensure that multidisciplinary support is provided. Hospitals should develop individual-level policies and share these with staff and parents. Additionally, hospitals should ideally track the effect of parental visitation rights on hospital-based COVID-19 outbreaks, the mental health of hospitalised children, and their rate of recovery.","Goga, A; Feucht, U; Pillay, S; Reubenson, G; Jeena, P; Mahdi, S; Mayet, N T; Velaphi, S; McKerrow, N; Mathivha, L R; Makubalo, N; Green, R J; Gray, G",S Afr Med J,,636

Objective: To compare intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) plus methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone as initial therapy in MIS-C. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study drawn from a national surveillance system with propensity score-matched analysis. All cases with suspected MIS-C were reported to the French National Public Health Agency. Confirmed MIS-C cases fulfilling the World Health Organization definition were included. The study started on April 1, 2020, and follow-up ended on January 6, 2021. Exposures: IVIG and methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was persistence of fever 2 days after the introduction of initial therapy or recrudescence of fever within 7 days, which defined treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included a second-line therapy, hemodynamic support, acute left ventricular dysfunction after first-line therapy, and length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit. The primary analysis involved propensity score matching with a minimum caliper of 0.1. Results: Among 181 children with suspected MIS-C, 111 fulfilled the World Health Organization definition (58 females [52%]; median age, 8.6 years [interquartile range, 4.7 to 12.1]). Five children did not receive either treatment. Overall, 3 of 34 children (9%) in the IVIG and methylprednisolone group and 37 of 72 (51%) in the IVIG alone group did not respond to treatment. Treatment with IVIG and methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone was associated with lower risk of treatment failure (absolute risk difference, -0.28 [95% CI, -0.48 to -0.08]; odds ratio [OR], 0.25 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.70]; P = .008). IVIG and methylprednisolone therapy vs IVIG alone was also significantly associated with lower risk of use of second-line therapy (absolute risk difference, -0.22 [95% CI, -0.40 to -0.04]; OR, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.06 to 0.61]; P = .004), hemodynamic support (absolute risk difference, -0.17 [95% CI, -0.34 to -0.004]; OR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.06 to 0.76]), acute left ventricular dysfunction occurring after initial therapy (absolute risk difference, -0.18 [95% CI, -0.35 to -0.01]; OR, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.06 to 0.66]), and duration of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (median, 4 vs 6 days; difference in days, -2.4 [95% CI, -4.0 to -0.7]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among children with MIS-C, treatment with IVIG and methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone was associated with a more favorable fever course. Study interpretation is limited by the observational design.","Ouldali, Naïm; Toubiana, Julie; Antona, Denise; Javouhey, Etienne; Madhi, Fouad; Lorrot, Mathie; Léger, Pierre-Louis; Galeotti, Caroline; Claude, Caroline; Wiedemann, Arnaud; Lachaume, Noémie; Ovaert, Caroline; Dumortier, Morgane; Kahn, Jean-Emmanuel; Mandelcwajg, Alexis; Percheron, Lucas; Biot, Blandine; Bordet, Jeanne; Girardin, Marie-Laure; Yang, David Dawei; Grimaud, Marion; Oualha, Mehdi; Allali, Slimane; Bajolle, Fanny; Beyler, Constance; Meinzer, Ulrich; Levy, Michael; Paulet, Ana-Maria; Levy, Corinne; Cohen, Robert; Belot, Alexandre; Angoulvant, François",JAMA,,636

Understanding the socioeconomic, demographic and health determinants affecting the pandemic is of interest to stakeholders. The purpose of this ecological study is to analyse the effect of the different socioeconomic, demographic and healthcare determinants on the mortality rate and estimated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 first wave in the Spanish regions. METHODS: From the available data of the 17 Spanish regions (Autonomous Communities), we have carried out an ecological study through multivariate linear regression using ordinary least squares. To do this, we conducted an analysis using two distinct dependent variables: the logarithm of mortality rate per 1,000,000 inhabitants and the estimated cumulative incidence. The study has 12 explanatory variables. RESULTS: After applying the backward stepwise multivariate analysis, we obtained a model with nine significant variables at different levels for mortality rate and a model with seven significant variables for estimated cumulative incidence. Among them, six variables are statistically significant and of the same sign in both models: ""Nursing homes beds"", ""Proportion of care homes over 100 beds"", ""Log GDP per capita"", ""Aeroplane passengers"", ""Proportion of urban people"", and the dummy variable ""Island region"". CONCLUSIONS: The different socioeconomic, demographic and healthcare determinants of each region have a significant effect on the mortality rate and estimated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in territories where the measures initially adopted to control the pandemic have been identical.","García, Carlos Navarro",BMC Public Health,,636

This study aimed to determine the relationship between changes in temperature, humidity, rainfall, and SARS-CoV-2 contagion. Five ecologically and climatically distinct regions were considered-Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar, and Gilgit-Baltistan. Method: Data on daily COVID-19 cases and deaths were retrieved from government officials, while meteorological information was collected from Pakistan Meteorological Department.. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20 and the Spearman rank correlation test was used to analyze the correlation between the meteorological factors and COVID-19 cases and deaths. Result: Positive correlation of COVID-19 incidence was observed with all the temperature ranges (maximum, minimum and average) and negative correlation was seen with humidity, DTR and rainfall. COVID-19 deaths were positively associated with temperature and were negatively associated only with humidity. Linear regression showed that for every unit increase in humidity, there was a -3.345 daily significant decrease in COVID-19 cases, while in Karachi for every unit increase in humidity, there remained a 10.104 daily significant increase in cases. In Gilgit-Baltistan, for every unit increase in average temperature and rainfall respectively, significant increases of 0.534 and 1.286 in daily cases were found. Conclusion: This study signifies the effect of climate factors on COVID-19 incidence and mortality rate, but climate factors are not the only variable and several other interlinked factors enhance the spread of COVID-19. Hence, effective mitigation policies, enhancing testing capacities, and developing public attitudes toward adopting precautionary measures are important to overcome this overwhelming pandemic.","Basray, Rabia; Malik, Amber; Waqar, Wajiha; Chaudhry, Ambreen; Wasif Malik, Muhammad; Ali Khan, Mumtaz; Ansari, Jamil A; Ikram, Aamir",J Biosaf Biosecur,,636

Clinical evidence has implicated the emergence of cytokine release syndrome as the prominent cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we observed massive elevation of plasma Galectin-9 (Gal-9) in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (HCs). By using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, we found that a baseline of 2,042 pg/ml plasma Gal-9 can differentiate SARS-CoV-2-infected from noninfected individuals with high specificity/sensitivity (95%). Analysis of 30 cytokines and chemokines detected a positive correlation of the plasma Gal-9 with C-reactive protein (CRP) and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;), IP-10, MIP-1&#945;, and MCP-1 but an inverse correlation with transforming growth factor ß (TGF-ß) in COVID-19 patients. In agreement, we found enhanced production of IL-6 and TNF-&#945; by monocytes and NK cells of COVID-19 patients once treated with the recombinant human Gal-9 in vitro Also, we observed that although the cell-membrane expression of Gal-9 on monocytes does not change in COVID-19 patients, those with higher Gal-9 expression exhibit an activated phenotype. Furthermore, we noted significant downregulation of surface Gal-9 in neutrophils from COVID-19 patients compared to HCs. Our further investigations indicated that immune activation following SARS-CoV-2 infection results in Gal-9 shedding from neutrophils. The strong correlation of Gal-9 with proinflammatory mediators suggests that inhibition of Gal-9 may severe as a therapeutic approach in COVID-19 infection. Besides, the plasma Gal-9 measurement may be used as a surrogate diagnostic biomarker in COVID-19 patients.IMPORTANCE The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection has enormously impacted our lives. Clinical evidence has implicated the emergence of cytokine release syndrome as the prominent cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients. We observed substantial elevation of the plasma Galectin-9 (Gal-9) in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Gal-9 is an abundant protein in many immune and nonimmune cells. We found that Gal-9 detection assay can differentiate SARS-CoV-2-infected from noninfected individuals with a specificity/sensitivity of 95%. Importantly, we found a positive correlation of the plasma Gal-9 with a wide range of proinflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. In agreement, we found enhanced expression and production of such proinflammatory molecules by immune cells of COVID-19 patients once treated with Gal-9 in vitro Our results propose Gal-9 as an important contributing factor in cytokine release syndrome; therefore, Gal-9 inhibition may serve as a beneficial therapeutic approach by suppressing the hyperimmune activation in COVID-19 patients.","Bozorgmehr, Najmeh; Mashhouri, Siavash; Perez Rosero, Eliana; Xu, Lai; Shahbaz, Shima; Sligl, Wendy; Osman, Mohammed; Kutsogiannis, Demetrios J; MacIntyre, Erika; O039,; Neil, Conar R; Elahi, Shokrollah",mBio (Online),,636

To place recent findings into context, we compared symptoms and functional health status in two independent samples assessed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were recruited via an online panel using quota sampling. We assessed symptoms, functional health, and global quality of life with the EORTC QLQ-C30 in two general population samples in Spain (collected in July 2019 and April 2020). We also assessed several COVID-19 related variables, such as adherence to social distancing. RESULTS: Data from N = 1010 participants before the pandemic (mean age 47.1 years, 50.5% female) were compared with data from N = 504 participants during the pandemic (mean age 47.1 years, 50.8% female). Participants during the pandemic (vs. before the pandemic) reported lower role functioning and emotional functioning, as well as less symptom burden. A lower degree of social distancing was associated with better functional health and lower symptom burden. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on functional health and symptom burden in the Spanish general population. The comparison of before and during the pandemic can be used to benchmark results raised only during the pandemic.","Lehmann, Jens; Holzner, Bernhard; Giesinger, Johannes M; Bottomley, Andrew; Ansari, Shaad; von Butler, Ludwig; Kemmler, Georg",BMC Public Health,,636

428215,The management of COVID-19 across the NHS,2020,"The novel COVID-19 global pandemic has raised, among many others, major concerns regarding the impact of infection during pregnancy. Current evidence suggests that vertical transmission from mother to baby, antenatally or intrapartum, does occur, but is uncommon. According to the published reports of infants born to COVID-19-affected mothers, as well as the anecdotal experience of current practices worldwide, it appears that investigations regarding the potential of SARS-COV-2 vertical transmission in pregnancy have so far been based, to a large extent, on PCR testing of neonatal pharyngeal swab samples. Given that the transplacental route of intrauterine transmission for SARS-COV-2 is less likely to immediately involve the upper respiratory tract of the newborn, contrary to what happens after birth, it would be advisable to include appropriate biological samples, such as cord blood, placenta, amniotic fluid and neonatal blood, along with the pharyngeal samples, in order to contribute significantly to such investigations. It is important to point out that negative PCR tests of neonatal pharyngeal samples do not exclude the possibility of intrauterine viral transmission, while positive pharyngeal swabs are more likely to reflect intrapartum or postpartum contaminants, rather than antenatal intrauterine transmission, in the absence of other criteria. Revision and enhancement of the so far prevailing practices appear important, in order to facilitate the development of good clinical practice for managing neonates and ensuring safety of families and healthcare providers.","Konstantinidou, Anastasia-E; Skaltsounis, Panagiotis; Eleftheriades, Makarios; Antsaklis, Panagiotis; Charitou, Antonia; Anatolitou, Fani; Moutafi, Athina; Petropoulos, Panagiotis; Daskalakis, George",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,,636

428460,The influence of COVID-19-related stress on food motivation,2021,"Recently released interim numbers from advanced vaccine candidate clinical trials suggest that a COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) of >90% is achievable. However, SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics are highly heterogeneous and exhibit localized bursts of transmission, which may lead to sharp localized peaks in the number of new cases, often followed by longer periods of low incidence. Here we show that, for interim estimates of VE, these characteristic bursts in SARS-CoV-2 infection may introduce a strong positive bias in VE. Specifically, we generate null models of vaccine effectiveness, i.e., random models with bursts that over longer periods converge to zero VE but that for interim periods frequently produce apparent VE near 100%. As an example, by following the relevant clinical trial protocol, we can reproduce recently reported interim outcomes from an ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of an RNA-based vaccine candidate. Thus, to avoid potential random biases in VE, it is suggested that interim estimates on COVID-19 VE should control for the intrinsic inhomogeneity in both SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics and reported cases.","Lisewski, Andreas Martin",Int J Infect Dis,,636

429481,Antiviral Drug Discovery To Address the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore has largely centred around migrant worker dormitories, comprising over 90% of all cases in the country. Dormitories are home to a culturally and linguistically distinct, low-income population, without on-site healthcare after-hours. The primary objective of this study was to assess the engagement and utilisation of a simple, low-cost, accessible, mobile health solution for remote self-reporting of vital parameters in dormitory residents with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective review of medical care. SETTING: Two large migrant worker dormitories with a combined population of 31 546. PARTICIPANTS: All COVID-19-affected residents housed in dormitories during the study period. INTERVENTION: All residents were taught to use a chat assistant to self-report their temperature, heart rate and oxygen saturations. Results flowed into a dashboard, which alerted clinicians of abnormal results. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome measure was engagement rate. This was derived from the total number of residents who registered on the platform over the total number of COVID-19-affected residents in the dormitories during the study period. Secondary outcome measures included outcomes of the alerts and subsequent escalations of care. RESULTS: 800 of the 931 COVID-19-affected residents (85.9%) engaged with the platform to log a total of 12 511 discrete episodes of vital signs. Among 372 abnormal readings, 96 teleconsultations were initiated, of which 7 (1.8%) were escalated to emergency services and 18 (4.9%) were triaged to earlier physical medical review on-site. CONCLUSIONS: A chat-assistant-based self-reporting platform is an effective and safe community-based intervention to monitor marginalised populations with distinct cultural and linguistic backgrounds, living communally and affected by COVID-19.

Although this technique is usually performed to sedated patients on invasive mechanical ventilation, it has been used in non-intubated patients frequently during the coronavirus diseases-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Favorable outcomes have been reported mainly in combining the prone positioning with high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Due to limited data, a standard approach for the awake prone positioning has not yet been defined. In this manuscript, we reviewed the literature data about prone positioning in non-intubated patients with COVID-19. According to available literature data, we concluded that prone positioning in non-intubated COVID-19 patients may improve oxygenation and prevent the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. But the efficacy is still controversial in the early stage of the disease due to pulmonary mechanics. Further studies are needed to the defined optimal approach of awake prone positioning in COVID-19 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure.","Gürün Kaya, Aslihan; Öz, Miraç; Erol, Serhat; Çiftçi, Fatma; Çiledag, Aydin; Kaya, Akin",Tuberk Toraks,,636

Alternatively, surrogate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using ACE2 as the target structure for the detection of neutralization-competent antibodies have been developed. They are capable of high throughput, have a short turnaround time, and can be performed under standard laboratory safety conditions. However, there are very limited data on their clinical performance and how they compare to the PRNT. We evaluated three surrogate immunoassays (GenScript SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test Kit (GenScript Biotech, Piscataway Township, NJ, USA), the TECO® SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Assay (TECOmedical AG, Sissach, Switzerland), and the Leinco COVID-19 ImmunoRank™ Neutralization MICRO-ELISA (Leinco Technologies, Fenton, MO, USA)) and one automated quantitative SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-based IgG antibody assay (Abbott GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany) by testing 78 clinical samples, including several follow-up samples of six BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer, Mainz, Germany/New York, NY, USA) vaccinated individuals. Using the PRNT as a reference method, the overall sensitivity of the examined assays ranged from 93.8 to 100% and specificity ranged from 73.9 to 91.3%. Weighted kappa demonstrated a substantial to almost perfect agreement. The findings of our study allow these assays to be considered when a PRNT is not available. However, the latter still should be the preferred choice. For optimal clinical performance, the cut-off value of the TECO assay should be individually adapted.","Kohmer, N.; Rühl, C.; Ciesek, S.; Rabenau, H. F.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,636

We demonstrate an adaptive microscope employing a tunable objective and a tunable eyepiece with large zooming range. The tunable objective consists of three glass lenses and four electrowetting liquid lenses. The tunable eyepiece consists of an achromatic eyepiece and an electrowetting liquid lens. The focal point between the objective and the eyepiece is designed to be tunable, which are controlled by voltages. Thus, the tuning range is relatively large. We fabricate the adaptive microscope and observe the specimen. In the experiment, the magnification of the microscope changes continuously from ~ 59.1 × to ~ 159.2 × , and the largest numerical aperture is ~ 0.212. The tunable eyepiece can release the back focal length of the tunable objective, which increases the zoom range of the microscope. No mechanical movement is required and the aberrations can be corrected over a wide wavelength range. Thus, the proposed adaptive microscope has a potential application in biological research and clinical medical examination.","Kuang, Feng-Lin; Yuan, Rong-Ying; Wang, Qiong-Hua; Li, Lei",Sci Rep,,636

The Covid 19 crisis permits to increase the role of Telemedicine as a tool for the delivery of health care services at distance and to slow down the virus diffusion. This technology is cheap and easy to use but it is limited by governmental licensing restrictions, reimbursement barriers, lesser extent of infrastructure and difficulties related to the change. During COVID 19 Epidemy, Telemedicine is safe, low cost and permits to treat urgent and routine specialist cases without human proximity and contact which would spread infection, particularly to the elderly and immunocompromised patients.

Despite this, the vaccine has protected many millions from severe and disseminated forms of tuberculosis (TB). In addition, BCG has cross-mycobacterial effects against non-tuberculous mycobacteria and off-target (also called non-specific or heterologous) effects against other infections and diseases. More recently, BCG's effects on innate immunity suggest it might improve the immune response against viral respiratory infections including SARS-CoV-2. New TB vaccines, developed over the last 30â¯years, show promise, particularly in prevention of progression to disease from TB infection in young adults. The role of BCG in the context of new TB vaccines remains uncertain as most participants included in trials have been previously BCG immunised.

442695,Covid-19 pandemic: Will a vaccine be available soon?,2020,"The article analyzes how global socio-political destabilization manifests itself, and how this is associated with the growing inefficiency of many international institutions due to an increasingly dysfunctional “unipolar” world order model By focusing on the examples of the EU and the Russian Federation, this article studies the influence of global destabilization on the dynamics of political institutions both on the level of individual states and on the supranational level Some general characteristics defining the modern political and institutional dynamics across EU countries are analyzed;these are associated with processes for strengthening socio-political destabilization These trends, in particular, include: the decline in the effectiveness of traditional political parties, the growing polarization of party-political systems;the rise of populism, euroscepticism and right-wing radicalism;intensified contradictions in interactions between central and regional political institutions, amidst the growth of separatist sentiments;and the collapse and fundamental transformation of the structure and functions of the national state (nation-state) as an “ideal” It is shown that the supranational political institutions of the EU as a whole are not effective enough in responding to the new challenges of external cultural migration, political polarization within European societies, the crisis of the social state, and the global COVID-19 epidemic The reasons for this inefficiency are analyzed In Russia, which is yet to fully take the form of a Western European-type nation-state, the political institutions introduced in the 1990s are undergoing intensive changes, adapting to this global destabilization in accordance with the model of institutional tracks that is different from the model of the national state This involves applying elements of an imperial socio-political organization Therefore, the first part of the study is devoted to the analysis of the problems and symptoms of increasing global destabilization and the formulation of the research problem;this is then solved in the next three parts In a comparative perspective, three cases of institutional dynamics were studied: the EU as a whole, the EU at the level of national states, and the Russian Federation as a paradoxical state (national in form, but evolving in a different direction) The final part discusses the results and main findings of the study From 2020 to 2030, as the EU and Russia are entering a period of deep and critical institutional, it is predicted that they must transform and adapt to the upcoming dramatic remodeling of the world order В статье проанализированы основные проявления глобальной социально-политической дестабилизации, связанные с растущей неэффективностью многих международных институтов и с усилением дисфункций “униполярной” модели мирового порядка На примере ЕС и РФ исследовано влияние глобальной дестабилизации на динамику политических институтов на уровне отдельных государств и на наднациональном уровне Проанализированы некоторые общие тенденции современной политико-институциональной динамики в странах ЕС, связанные с процессами усиления социально-политической дестабилизации К этим тенденциям, в частности, относятся: падение эффективности традиционных политических партий, растущая поляризация партийно-политических систем;подъем популизма, евроскептицизма и правого радикализма;усиление противоречий во взаимодействии центральных и региональных политических институтов, рост сепаратистских настроений;кризис и принципиальная трансформация структуры и функционала национального государства как идеального типа (nation-state) Показано, что наднациональные политические институты ЕС в целом недостаточно эффективно отвечают на новые вызовы, связанные с инокультурной миграцией, политической поляризацией внутри европейских обществ, кризисом социального государства, глобальной эпидемией COVID-19 Проанализированы причины этой неэффективности В России, где национальное государство западноевропейского типа по ряду причин не сформировалось, политические институты, имплантированные в 1990-е годы, претерпевают интенсивные изменения, адаптируясь к условиям глобальной дестабилизации в русле иных, нежели модель nation-state, институциональных

443334,Suicide in the context of COVID-19 diagnosis in India: Insights and implications from online print media reports,2021,"Remdesivir (RDV; GS-5734; Veklury®), the first FDA-approved antiviral to treat COVID-19, is a single diastereomer monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analogue. RDV is taken up in the target cells and metabolized in multiple steps to form the active nucleoside triphosphate (TP) (GS-443902), which in turn acts as a potent and selective inhibitor of multiple viral RNA polymerases. In this report, we profiled the key enzymes involved in the RDV metabolic pathway with multiple parallel approaches: (1) bioinformatic analysis of nucleoside/tide metabolic enzyme mRNA expression using public human tissue and lung single-cell RNAseq datasets; (2) protein and mRNA quantification of enzymes in human lung tissue and primary lung cells; (3) biochemical studies on the catalytic rate of key enzymes; (4) effects of specific enzyme inhibitors on the GS-443902 formation; and (5) the effects of these inhibitors on RDV antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. Our data collectively demonstrated that carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and cathepsin A (CatA) are enzymes involved in hydrolyzing RDV to its alanine intermediate Met X, which is further hydrolyzed to the monophosphate form by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1). The monophosphate is then consecutively phosphorylated to diphosphate and triphosphate by cellular phosphotransferases. Our data support the hypothesis that the unique properties of RDV prodrug not only allow lung-specific accumulation critical for the treatment of respiratory viral infection such as COVID-19, they also enable efficient intracellular metabolism of RDV and its Met X to monophosphate and successive phosphorylation to form the active TP in disease-relevant cells.","Li, Ruidong; Liclican, Albert; Xu, Yili; Pitts, Jared; Niu, Congrong; Zhang, Jingyu; Kim, Cynthia; Zhao, Xiaofeng; Soohoo, Daniel; Babusis, Darius; Yue, Qin; Ma, Bin; Murray, Bernard P; Subramanian, Raju; Xie, Xuping; Zou, Jing; Bilello, John P; Li, Li; Schultz, Brian E; Sakowicz, Roman; Smith, Bill J; Shi, Pei-Yong; Murakami, Eisuke; Feng, Joy Y",Antimicrob Agents Chemother,,636

El objetivo de esta investigación es dimensionar el impacto de la crisis sobre la inversión publicitaria, pero también analizar sus repercusiones sobre el sistema de medios y sus nuevas dinámicas de consumo. El análisis comparado de datos secundarios de fuentes nacionales e internacionales de gran consenso empresarial y social, durante el período de la primera ola de la pandemia en España (marzo-septiembre de 2020), permite calibrar las mutaciones en curso y dejar esbozados nuevos escenarios para la industria publicitaria y para los modelos de negocio mediáticos, todavía en construcción, marcados por el predominio de los soportes digitales y de internet, pero también por su conjunción con la televisión y sus nuevas formas y públicos. Entre los hallazgos más relevantes se sugieren contradicciones inéditas en el comportamiento de la publicidad durante el período a estudio, tales como la ruptura de la estacionalidad publicitaria por primera vez desde que existen datos de medición en España, y la paradoja entre el fuerte ascenso del consumo mediático y el hundimiento de las inversiones publicitarias.Alternate abstract:The economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has severely affected the advertising industry worldwide, but the Spanish case can be seen as a particularly privileged laboratory for such observations as a result of the collapse of investments and their redistribution to other time periods, economic sectors, or communication channels. The aim of this research is, firstly, to estimate the impact of the crisis on advertising investment, and secondly to analyze its con-sequences for the media system and new consumption dynamics. We carry out a comparative analysis of secondary data from national and international sources which enjoy broad business and social consensus, covering the period of the first wave of the pandemic in Spain (March-September 2020). The results enable the identification of the ongoing transformations and an outline of new scenarios for the advertising industry and media business. These scenarios are still under construction and feature a predominance of digital media and the Internet, but also a conjunction with tele-vision and its new formats and audiences. Among the most relevant findings of this research, we observed unexpected contradictions in advertising behavior. These include the first breakdown of advertising seasonality since measurement data exist in Spain, and a paradoxical, sharp rise in media use in conjunction with the collapse of advertising expenditure.","Corredor-Lanas, Patricia Marcos-Recio Juan-Carlos Montañés-García Fernando",El Profesional de la Información,,636

C57BL/6 mice were injected with Adenoviruses (Ad)-shTHRIL or negative control (NC) before caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) operation. MPVECs were transfected with Ad-shTHRIL or NC, followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. MiR-424 and Rho-associated kinase 2 (ROCK2) were predicted and verified as direct targets of THRIL and miR-424, respectively, by using dual-luciferase reporter assay. ROCK2 overexpression vector and shTHRIL were co-transfected into mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells for 24 h before LPS treatment. Our results showed that THRIL was highly expressed in the lung of sepsis mice. CLP triggered severe lung injury and apoptosis in mice, which was abolished by THRIL knockdown. Moreover, CLP treatment visibly increased protein concentration, the number of total cell of neutrophils, and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Besides, elevated protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, interleukin-1ß, and interleukin-6 were observed in both lung and BALF. However, inhibition of THRIL reduced the number of inflammatory cells and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in sepsis mouse model. The effect of THRIL on inflammatory response and apoptosis in the lung was confirmed in sepsis cell model. Moreover, mechanistic studies have shown that THRIL up-regulated ROCK2 level through sponging miR-424. Furthermore, ROCK2 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effects of THRIL knockdown on LPS-induced inflammatory response and apoptosis. Overall, in vivo and in vitro results suggested that THRIL accelerates sepsis-induced lung injury by sponging miR-424 and further restoring ROCK2.","Chen, Huibin; Hu, Xuemei; Li, Ruiting; Liu, Boyi; Zheng, Xiang; Fang, Zhicheng; Chen, Li; Chen, Wei; Min, Li; Hu, Shengli",Mol Immunol,,636

445872,A Call to the CMS: Mandate Adequate Professional Nurse Staffing in Nursing Homes,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Many routine sinonasal procedures utilising powered instruments are regarded as aerosol-generating. This study aimed to assess how different instrument settings affect detectable droplet spread and patterns of aerosolised droplet spread during simulated sinonasal surgery in order to identify mitigation strategies. DESIGN: Simulation series using three-dimensional (3-D) printed sinonasal model. Fluorescein droplet spread was assessed following microdebriding and drilling of fluorescein-soaked grapes and bones, respectively. SETTING: University dry lab. PARTICIPANTS: 3-D printed sinonasal model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patterns of aerosolised droplet spread. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There were no observed fluorescein droplets or splatter in the measured surgical field after microdebridement of nasal polyps at aspecific irrigation rate and suction pressure. Activation of the microdebrider in the presence of excess fluid in the nasal cavity (reduced or blocked suction pressure, excessive irrigation fluid or bleeding) resulted in detectable droplet spread. Drilling with either coarse diamond or cutting burs resulted in detectable droplets and greater spread was observed when drilling within the anterior nasal cavity. High-speed drilling is a high-risk AGP but the addition of suction using a third hand technique reduces detectable droplet spread outside the nasal cavity. Using the instrument outside the nasal cavity inadvertently, or when unblocking, produces greater droplet spread and requires more caution.","Leong, Samuel C; Mogre, Dilesh; Andrews, Peter; Davies, Elgan",Clin Otolaryngol,,636

446446,"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity, anxiety, and depression in patients with Parkinson's disease",2021,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large positive stranded enveloped RNA viruses that generally cause enteric and respiratory diseases in humans and in animals. Most human CoVs have recently attracted global attention to their lethal potential and great infectious capacity. A highly pathogenic CoV, called COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2, dramatically emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. This new CoV has caused severe pneumonia in China and rapidly spreads around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic. Growing evidence pieces show that viruses, such as CoVs, can enter the central nervous system from different pathways and inducing neurotoxicity. Therefore, it is urgent to make clear whether SARS-CoV-2 has access to the central nervous system and can cause direct neuronal effects. Moreover, a brain-lung-brain axis is been proposed from the scientific community where severe neurological dysfunction and injury are associated with lung injury, and vice versa. In this axis, virus-induced inflammation and oxidative stress could be the common mechanisms responsible for CoV neurological symptoms. Therefore, is important to make clear whether SARS-CoV-2 lung damage can cause direct or indirect neuronal effects.","Nuzzo, Domenico; Picone, Pasquale",Neurosci Res,,636

447043,On reading richard preston’s the hot zone during the covid-19 pandemic,2020,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at a higher risk of developing colitis-associated colorectal cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of CD73 in IBD-associated tumorigenesis. A mouse model of colitis-associated tumorigenesis (CAT) induced by azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium was successfully constructed. Model mice were injected with CD73 inhibitor or adenosine receptor agonist. Colon length, body weight loss and tumor formation were assessed macroscopically. Inflammatory cytokine measurement and RNA sequencing on colon tissues were performed. Inhibition of CD73 by adenosine 5'-(&#945;,ß-methylene) diphosphate (APCP) suppressed the severity of CAT with attenuated weight loss, longer colons, lower tumor number and smaller tumor size compared with the model group. Activation of adenosine receptors using 1-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-1-deoxy-N-ethyl-ß-D-ribofuranuronamide (NECA) exacerbated CAT. Histological assessment indicated that inhibition of CD73 reduced, while activation of adenosine receptors exacerbated, the histological damage of the colon. Increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-&#945; and interleukin-6) in colonic tissue was detected in the NECA group. According to RNA sequencing results, potential oncogenes such as arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), Bcl-2-like protein 15 (Bcl2l15) and N-acetylaspartate synthetase (Nat8l) were downregulated in the APCP group and upregulated in the NECA group compared with the model group. Therefore, inhibition of CD73 attenuated IBD-associated tumorigenesis, while activation of adenosine receptors exacerbated tumorigenesis in a C57BL/6J mouse model. This effect may be associated with the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the regulation of ALOX15, Bcl2l15 and Nat8l.","Liu, Xuan-Hui; Wu, Xian-Rui; Lan, Nan; Zheng, Xiao-Bin; Zhou, Chi; Hu, Tuo; Chen, Yu-Feng; Cai, Ze-Rong; Chen, Ze-Xian; Lan, Ping; Wu, Xiao-Jian",Oncol Lett,,636

It has been suggested that frequent infections due to low-pathogenicity coronaviruses in children, imparts immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in this age group. From a prospective birth cohort study prior to the pandemic, we identified children (n=42) with proven low-pathogenicity coronavirus infections. Convalescent sera from these samples had antibodies against the respective seasonal CoVs as demonstrated by immunofluorescence assay. We tested these samples for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 using virus microneutralization assay. Forty serum samples showed no significant neutralization of SARS-CoV-2, while 2 samples showed inconclusive results. These findings suggest that the antibodies generated in low-pathogenicity coronavirus infections offer no protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection in young children.","Dhochak, Nitin; Agrawal, Tanvi; Shaman, Heena; Khan, Naseem Ahmed; Kumar, Prawin; Kabra, Sushil K; Medigeshi, Guruprasad R; Lodha, Rakesh",,,636

Thus, there is a need for alternative programs for HCV therapy implementation and disease monitoring. Our aim was to provide a multidisciplinary approach, so that HCV-infected patients from distant locations may benefit from HCV antivirals during the COVID-19 outbreak and within the lockdown period in Romania. Previously diagnosed HCV patients willing to participate in this telemedicine pilot study were included. Patient characteristics and medical adherence were assessed and compared to the year preceding the pandemic. We proposed a multidisciplinary approach by using a telemedicine program for HCV therapy monitoring. Patients also received a satisfaction questionnaire after delivering the sustained virologic response (SVR) result. A total of 41 patients agreed to participate in this study. The medication adherence was 100% for patients included in the telemedicine group, with a statistically significant difference from the medication adherence of the patients treated in 2019. The satisfaction item score was 4.92 out of 5 and our results (r = -0.94, p &lt; 0.0001) suggested that older patients embraced the telemedicine program less, but with the same success in terms of SVR (100%) and medication adherence (100%). Our pilot study offers the first example of a telemedicine program in Romania for HCV therapeutic management. During the lockdown period, telemedicine has served as a reliable tool and novel alternative for conventional monitoring of patients treated with direct antiviral agents and should be further considered even following the pandemic.","Doica, I.

In response to the school closures, parents of students were obliged to care for their children during the daytime, when children usually were at school. Did the increase in the burden of childcare influence parents' mental health? Based on short panel data from mid-March to mid-April 2020, we explore how school closures influenced the mental health of parents with school-aged children. Using a fixed-effects model, we find that school closures led to mothers of students suffering from worse mental health compared to other females, while the fathers' mental health did not differ from that of other males. This tendency is only observed for less-educated mothers who had children attending primary school, not for those with children attending junior high school nor for more-educated mothers. The contribution of this paper is showing that school closures increased the inequality of mental health between genders and parents with different educational backgrounds.","Yamamura, Eiji; Tsustsui, Yoshiro",J Popul Econ,,636

DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional regression analysis via the Fama-MacBeth procedure is adopted. SETTING: We use the data for COVID-19 daily symptom-onset cases for 100 Chinese cities and COVID-19 daily confirmed cases for 1005 US counties. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 69 498 cases in China and 740 843 cases in the USA are used for calculating the effective reproductive numbers. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Regression analysis of the impact of temperature and relative humidity on the effective reproductive number (R value). RESULTS: Statistically significant negative correlations are found between temperature/relative humidity and the effective reproductive number (R value) in both China and the USA. CONCLUSIONS: Higher temperature and higher relative humidity potentially suppress the transmission of COVID-19. Specifically, an increase in temperature by 1°C is associated with a reduction in the R value of COVID-19 by 0.026 (95% CI (-0.0395 to -0.0125)) in China and by 0.020 (95% CI (-0.0311 to -0.0096)) in the USA; an increase in relative humidity by 1% is associated with a reduction in the R value by 0.0076 (95% CI (-0.0108 to -0.0045)) in China and by 0.0080 (95% CI (-0.0150 to -0.0010)) in the USA.

METHODS: The epidemiological characteristics of 67 local clusters of COVID-19 cases in Sichuan Province reported as of March 17, 2020 were described and analyzed. Information about all COVID-19 clusters and involved cases was acquired from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention and analyzed with the epidemiological investigation results taken into account. RESULTS: The clusters were temporally and regionally concentrated. Clusters caused by imported cases from other provinces accounted for 73.13%; familial clusters accounted for 68.66%; the average attack rate was 8.54%, and the average secondary attack rate was 6.11%; the median incubation period was 8.5 d; a total of 28 cases met the criteria for incubation period determination, and in the 28 cases, the incubation period was > 14 d in 21.43% (6/28). a total of 226 confirmed cases were reported in the 67 clusters. Ten cases were exposed before the confirmed cases they contacted with developed clinical symptoms, and the possibility of exposure to other infection sources was ruled out; two clusters were caused by asymptomatic carriers; confirmed cases mainly presented with fever, respiratory and systemic symptoms; a gradual decline in the severity of clinical symptoms was noted with the increase of the case generation. CONCLUSIONS: Population movement and gathering restrictions and strict close contact management measures will significantly contribute to the identification and control of cases. Transmission during the incubation period and asymptomatic infections have been noted. Studies on the pathogenicity and transmissibility in these populations and on COVID-19 antibody levels and protective effects in healthy people and cases are required.","Mao, Suling; Huang, Ting; Yuan, Heng; Li, Min; Huang, Xiaomei; Yang, Changxiao; Zhou, Xingyu; Cheng, Xiuwei; Su, Qian; Wu, Xianping",BMC Public Health,,636

453523,Cohort profile: Early pandemic evaluation and enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II) database,2021,"The latest threat to global health is the COVID-19 outbreak. Although there exist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans, few COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy. At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in the biomedical literature. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of COVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from COVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset. We extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in the article and separated compound figures into subfigures. We also designed a deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify them accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as of May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute to improved DL performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza and trained a DL baseline to distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of diseases on CT. (3) We trained an unsupervised one-class classifier from non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4) From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared clinical symptoms and clinical findings of COVID-19 vs. those of influenza to demonstrate the disease differences in the scientific publications. We believe that our work is complementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset, code, and DL models are publicly available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/COVID-19-CT-CXR.","Peng, Yifan; Tang, Yu-Xing; Lee, Sungwon; Zhu, Yingying; Summers, Ronald M.; Lu, Zhiyong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06177v1.pdf,636
453584,A survey of anxiety and burnout in the radiology workforce of a tertiary hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"A mysterious outbreak of atypical pneumonia in late 2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan of China. Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization. We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes. Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spike's receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus. These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.","Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Kok, Kin-Hang; Zhu, Zheng; Chu, Hin; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Yuan, Shuofeng; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Emerg Microbes Infect,,636

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted in participants with MNCD recruited from two residential settings. Participants exergamed for 15 min, three times per week for 8 weeks. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in all participants of the trial after 4 and 8 weeks. Audio files were transcribed and subsequently a thematic content analysis was performed using NVivo 12. Activity logs including adherence and attrition rates were kept. RESULTS: Thirty-one participants with MNCD participated (median age = 85 (67-93) years; 77.4% women; Mini-Mental State Examination score = 19 (10-25)). Four broad themes emerged: (1) cognitive effects; (2) physical effects; (3) psychosocial effects and (4) motivators. The tailored exergame program was perceived as enjoyable. It stimulated participants' attention, concentration, reaction time, and memory. Participants reported improvements in balance, flexibility, and gait. Exergaming made participants energetic and calm. The attrition rate was 0% and the mean attendance rate was 79.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that standing balance exergaming is feasible, beneficial, and engaging in people with MNCD. Implications for rehabilitation Exergames present a personalised intervention for engaging people with major neurocognitive disorder in physical activity. An exergame intervention is feasible and highly appreciated in this population. Exergames should be adapted to the individuals' needs and possibilities in order to enhance motivation and learning.","Swinnen, Nathalie; Vandenbulcke, Mathieu; de Bruin, Eling D; Akkerman, Riekje; Stubbs, Brendon; Vancampfort, Davy",Disabil Rehabil,,636
454254,[Pediatric ophthalmology consultations during COVID-19 pandemic],2020,"The TMC genes encode a set of homologous transmembrane proteins, whose functions are not well understood. Biallelic mutations in either TMC6 or TMC8 are detected in more than half of cases of the pre-malignant skin disease epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). It is controversial whether EV induced by mutations in TMC6 or TMC8 originates from keratinocyte or lymphocyte defects. Quantification of TMC6 and TMC8 RNA levels in various organs revealed that lymphoid tissues have the highest levels of expression of both genes, and custom antibodies confirmed protein expression in mouse lymphocytes. To study the function of these proteins we generated mice with targeted deletion mutant alleles of Tmc6 or Tmc8. Either TMC6 or TMC8 deficiency induced a reduction in apparent molecular weight and/or amount of the other TMC molecule. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that TMC6 and TMC8 formed a protein complex in mouse and human T cells. Mass spectrometry and biochemical analysis demonstrated that TMC6 and TMC8 additionally interacted with the CIB1 protein to form TMC6-TMC8-CIB1 trimers. We demonstrated that TMC6 and TMC8 regulated CIB1 levels by protecting CIB1 from ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Reciprocally, CIB1 was needed for stabilizing TMC6 and TMC8 levels. These results suggest why inactivating mutations in any of the three human genes lead to similar clinical presentations. We also demonstrated that TMC6 and TMC8 levels are drastically lower and the proteins are less active in regulating CIB1 in keratinocytes than in T cells. Our study suggests that defects in lymphocytes may contribute to etiology and pathogenesis of EV.","Wu, Chuan-Jin; Li, Xing; Sommers, Connie L; Kurima, Kiyoto; Huh, Sunmee; Bugos, Grace; Dong, Lijin; Li, Wenmei; Griffith, Andrew J; Samelson, Lawrence E",J. biol. chem,,636

METHODS: We retrospectively collected chest CT images of 495 patients from three hospitals in China. 495 datasets were randomly divided into 395 cases (80%, 294 of COVID-19, 101 of other pneumonia) of the training set, 50 cases (10%, 37 of COVID-19, 13 of other pneumonia) of the validation set and 50 cases (10%, 37 of COVID-19, 13 of other pneumonia) of the testing set. We trained a multi-view fusion model using deep learning network to screen patients with COVID-19 using CT images with the maximum lung regions in axial, coronal and sagittal views. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated by both the validation and testing sets. RESULTS: The multi-view deep learning fusion model achieved the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.732, accuracy of 0.700, sensitivity of 0.730 and specificity of 0.615 in validation set. In the testing set, we can achieve AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 0.819, 0.760, 0.811 and 0.615 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based on deep learning method, the proposed diagnosis model trained on multi-view images of chest CT images showed great potential to improve the efficacy of diagnosis and mitigate the heavy workload of radiologists for the initial screening of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Wu, Xiangjun; Hui, Hui; Niu, Meng; Li, Liang; Wang, Li; He, Bingxi; Yang, Xin; Li, Li; Li, Hongjun; Tian, Jie; Zha, Yunfei",Eur J Radiol,,636

456912,Mobile cardiac monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic: Necessity is the mother of invention,2020,"BACKGROUND: People living in group situations or with dementia are more vulnerable to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Older people and those with multimorbidity have higher mortality if they become infected than the general population. However, no systematic study exists of COVID-19-related outcomes in older inpatients in psychiatric units, who comprise people from these high-risk groups. We aimed to describe the period prevalence, demographics, symptoms (and asymptomatic cases), management, and survival outcomes of COVID-19 in the older inpatient psychiatric population and people with young-onset dementia in five National Health Service Trusts in London, UK, from March 1 to April 30, 2020. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we collected demographic data, mental health diagnoses, clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, symptoms, management, and COVID-19-related outcome data of inpatients aged 65 years or older or with dementia who were already inpatients or admitted as inpatients to five London mental health Trusts between March 1 and April 30, 2020, and information about available COVID-19-related resources (ie, testing and personal protective equipment). Patients were determined to have COVID-19 if they had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, or had relevant symptoms indicative of COVID-19, as determined by their treating physician. We calculated period prevalence of COVID-19 and analysed patients' characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. FINDINGS: Of 344 inpatients, 131 (38%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period (period prevalence 38% [95% CI 33-43]). The mean age of patients who had COVID-19 was 75·3 years (SD 8·2); 68 (52%) were women and 47 (36%) from ethnic minority groups. 16 (12%) of 131 patients were asymptomatic and 121 (92%) had one or more disease-related comorbidity. 108 (82%) patients were compulsorily detained. 74 (56%) patients had dementia, of whom 13 (18%) had young-onset dementia. On average, sites received COVID-19 testing kits 4·5 days after the first clinical COVID-19 presentation. 19 (15%) patients diagnosed with COVID-19 died during the study period, and their deaths were determined to be COVID-19 related. INTERPRETATION: Patients in psychiatric inpatient settings who were admitted without known SARS-CoV-2 infection had a high risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 compared with those in the community and had a higher proportion of deaths from COVID-19 than in the community. Implementation of the long-standing policy of parity of esteem for mental health and planning for future COVID-19 waves in psychiatric hospitals is urgent.

In this work, we present for the first time a variational multi-task framework that allows joining three relevant tasks in MRI: reconstruction, registration and super-resolution. Our framework takes a set of multiple undersampled MR acquisitions corrupted by motion into a novel multi-task optimisation model, which is composed of an $L^2$ fidelity term that allows sharing representation between tasks, super-resolution foundations and hyperelastic deformations to model biological tissue behaviors. We demonstrate that this combination yields to significant improvements over sequential models and other bi-task methods.

METHODS: For this retrospective study, 143 hospitalized patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who underwent an unenhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan between January 1, 2020, and March 30, 2020, were included. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: There were 45 patients who were identified as critically ill. High visceral to subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio (called visceral adiposity) (odds ratio: 2.47; 95% CI: 1.05-5.98, P = 0.040) and low mean attenuation of skeletal muscle (called high intramuscular fat [IMF] deposition) (odds ratio: 11.90; 95% CI: 4.50-36.14; P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for critical illness. Furthermore, visceral adiposity or high IMF deposition increased the risk of mechanical ventilation (P = 0.013, P < 0.001, respectively). High IMF deposition increased the risk of death (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with visceral adiposity or high IMF deposition have higher risk for critical illness. Therefore, patients with abdominal obesity should be monitored more carefully when hospitalized.","Yang, Yang; Ding, Lin; Zou, Xianlun; Shen, Yaqi; Hu, Daoyu; Hu, Xuemei; Li, Zhen; Kamel, Ihab R",Obesity (Silver Spring),,636

However, the closure of our in-person operations provided our student management team with an opportunity to innovate. In consultation with Stanford's Telehealth team and educators, we rapidly developed a telehealth clinic model for our patients. We adapted available telehealth guidelines to meet our patient care needs and educational objectives, which manifested in 3 key innovations: reconfigured clinic operations, an evidence-based social needs screen to more effectively assess and address social needs alongside medical needs, and a new telehealth training module for student volunteers.

459926,COVID-19: The New Normal,2020,"BACKGROUND: Media play a key part in shaping nurses' social perception. Newspapers were chosen as the subject of this content analysis, as they are the main resource that Italians use to inform themselves. For this reason, ne wspapers are an appropriate resource to analyse the image of the nurse that, as found in literature, is seen as a dynamic phenomenon that changes according to different scenarios. Given the media focus on nurses during COVID- 19 it seems reasonable to analyse what nurse image was emerged. METHOD: A Content Analysis with an inductive process was conducted. The analysis' objective was to evaluate the image of the nurse in national and local newspapers, published between the 30th of January and the 18th of May 2020. A triangulation methodology was used between the two researchers to ensure data quality. R ESULTS: Five themes were identified. The risks for the nurse's psycho-physic wellbeing. Taking responsibility and human relations despite barriers. The acknowledgment of professional attributes. Uncertainty on the continuity of the nurses' social role emerged from the media. Nurses only wish to be appreciated for what they do. The agreement between the researchers on the themes has a Krippendor ff 's alpha between =0.713 and =0.985. CONCLUSIONS: The media's interest highlighted the nurses' competence in assisting patients with COVID-19. However, there isn't in-depth analysis, of the contemporar y image of the nurse, specifically in relation to leadership. Positive and negative tropes are recalled. The superficiality and fragility of the mediatic phenomena emerged, as opposed to a real positive strengthening of the nurse's social perception.","Giorgetta, Stefano; Pasquot, Laura",Prof Inferm,,636

The superiority of the design is that the nanofibers can absorb and store visible light energy and maintain the activity under light or dark environment. Moreover, the nanofibers can uninterruptedly release ROS in the absence of an external hydrogen donor, acting as a biocide under all weather conditions. A facile spraying method is proposed to rapidly deploy the functional nanofibers to existing PPE, such as protective suits and masks.

461307,Guidance for Building Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: We previously introduced PCPS (Proteasome Cleavage Prediction Server), a web-based tool to predict proteasome cleavage sites using n-grams. Here, we evaluated the ability of PCPS immunoproteasome cleavage model to discriminate CD8+ T cell epitopes. RESULTS: We first assembled an epitope dataset consisting of 844 unique virus-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes and their source proteins. We then analyzed cleavage predictions by PCPS immunoproteasome cleavage model on this dataset and compared them with those provided by a related method implemented by NetChop web server. PCPS was clearly superior to NetChop in term of sensitivity (0.89 vs. 0.79) but somewhat inferior with regard to specificity (0.55 vs. 0.60). Judging by the Mathew's Correlation Coefficient, PCPS predictions were overall superior to those provided by NetChop (0.46 vs. 0.39). We next analyzed the power of C-terminal cleavage predictions provided by the same PCPS model to discriminate CD8+ T cell epitopes, finding that they could be discriminated from random peptides with an accuracy of 0.74. Following these results, we tuned the PCPS web server to predict CD8+ T cell epitopes and predicted the entire SARS-CoV-2 epitope space. CONCLUSIONS: We report an improved version of PCPS named iPCPS for predicting proteasome cleavage sites and peptides with CD8+ T cell epitope features. iPCPS is available for free public use at https://imed.med.ucm.es/Tools/pcps/ .","Gomez-Perosanz, Marta; Ras-Carmona, Alvaro; Lafuente, Esther M; Reche, Pedro A",BMC Bioinformatics,,636

Increased morbidity and mortality is associated with older age, male gender, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and smoking. As COVID-19 spreads from coastal borders, both state to state and country to country, our understanding of its pathophysiology has evolved. Age and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) play especially important roles in COVID-19 progression. T2DM is an age-related disease associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemia), hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and endothelial activation and dysfunction. This review evaluates the relationships and intersection between endothelial cell activation and dysfunction in T2DM and COVID-19. COVID-19 induces multiple injuries of the terminal bronchioles and alveolar blood-gas barrier and associated ultrastructural tissue remodeling. COVID-19 may unmask multiple vulnerabilities associated with T2DM including damage to the endothelial glycocalyx and multiple end-organ macro and microvascular diseases. Unmasking existing vulnerabilities in diabetic patients with COVID-19 is important. Globally, we must come together to better understand why T2DM is associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.","Hayden, Melvin R",J Int Med Res,,636
461832,"Covid-19: Rich countries are putting ""relationships with big pharma"" ahead of ending pandemic, says Oxfam",2021,"BACKGROUND: Older adults and those with pre-existing medical conditions are at risk of death from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). In this period of quarantine, one of the reasons for going out is physical activity. This issue is important, as the impact of a sedentary lifestyle might be lower for children and young adults, but is far more severe for older adults. Although older adults need to stay at home because they have a higher risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), they need to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. Physical activity is important for older adults, especially to maintain their level of independence, mental health, and well-being. Maintaining mobility in old age is necessary, as it may predict loss of independence in older adults. OBJECTIVE: Our first objective was to evaluate the impact of this quarantine period on physical activity programs and on the physical and mental health of older adults. Our second objective was to discuss alternatives to physical activity programs that could be suggested for this population to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative survey using semistructured interviews with professionals (managers in charge of physical activity programs for older adults and sports trainers who run these physical activity programs) from the French Federation of Physical Education and Voluntary Gymnastics (FFPEVG) and older adults participating in a physical activity program of the FFPEVG. We followed a common interview guide. For analysis, we carried out a thematic analysis of the interviews. RESULTS: This study suggests that the COVID-19 epidemic has affected, before quarantine measures, the number of seniors attending group physical activity programs in the two study territories. In addition, despite the decline in their participation in group physical activities before the quarantine, older adults expressed the need to perform physical activity at home. There is a need to help older adults integrate simple and safe ways to stay physically active in a limited space. A national policy to support older adults for physical activity at home appears essential in this context. CONCLUSIONS: Given the results of our study, it seems necessary to globally communicate how important it is for older adults to maintain physical activity at home. We are concerned about the level of independence and mental health state of older adults after the end of quarantine if there is no appropriate campaign to promote physical activity among them at home.","Goethals, Luc; Barth, Nathalie; Guyot, Jessica; Hupin, David; Celarier, Thomas; Bongue, Bienvenu",JMIR Aging,,636

The total number of Covid-19-infected people in São Paulo has reached more than 1 million, while its total death toll stands at 25% of all the country's fatalities. Joining the Brazilian academia efforts in the fight against Covid-19, in this paper we describe a unified framework for monitoring and forecasting the Covid-19 progress in the state of São Paulo. More specifically, a freely available, online platform to collect and exploit Covid-19 time-series data is presented, supporting decision-makers while still allowing the general public to interact with data from different regions of the state. Moreover, a novel forecasting data-driven method has also been proposed, by combining the so-called Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased model with machine learning strategies to better fit the mathematical model's coefficients for predicting Infections, Recoveries, Deaths, and Viral Reproduction Numbers. We show that the obtained predictor is capable of dealing with badly conditioned data samples while still delivering accurate 10-day predictions. Our integrated computational system can be used for guiding government actions mainly in two basic aspects: real-time data assessment and dynamic predictions of Covid-19 curves for different regions of the state. We extend our analysis and investigation to inspect the virus spreading in Brazil in its regions.

We aimed to assess whether baricitinib improved pulmonary function in patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids for moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS: This observational study enrolled patients with moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) <200 mmHg] who received lopinavir/ritonavir and HCQ plus either corticosteroids (CS group, n = 50) or corticosteroids and baricitinib (BCT-CS group, n = 62). The primary end point was the change in oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2)/FiO2 from hospitalization to discharge. Secondary end points included the proportion of patients requiring supplemental oxygen at discharge and 1 month later. Statistics were adjusted by the inverse propensity score weighting (IPSW). RESULTS: A greater improvement in SpO2/FiO2 from hospitalization to discharge was observed in the BCT-CS vs CS group (mean differences adjusted for IPSW, 49; 95% CI: 22, 77; P < 0.001). A higher proportion of patients required supplemental oxygen both at discharge (62.0% vs 25.8%; reduction of the risk by 82%, OR adjusted for IPSW, 0.18; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.43; P < 0.001) and 1 month later (28.0% vs 12.9%, reduction of the risk by 69%, OR adjusted for IPSW, 0.31; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.86; P = 0.024) in the CS vs BCT-CS group.

463504,Reply to the Letter to the Editor: Value-based Healthcare: Not Going Anywhere-Why Orthopaedic Surgeons Will Continue Using Telehealth in a Post-COVID-19 World,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) associates with a considerable high rate of mortality and represents currently the most important concern in global health. The risk of more severe clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is higher in males and steeply raised with age but also increased by the presence of chronic comorbidities. Among the latter, early reports suggested that arterial hypertension associates with higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, more severe course and increased COVID-19-related deaths. Furthermore, experimental studies suggested that key pathophysiological hypertension mechanisms, such as activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), may play a role in COVID-19. In fact, ACE2 (angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2) is the pivotal receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells and provides thus a link between COVID-19 and RAS. It was thus anticipated that drugs modulating the RAS including an upregulation of ACE2 may increase the risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2 and poorer outcomes in COVID-19. Since the use of RAS-blockers, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, represents the backbone of recommended antihypertensive therapy and intense debate about their use in the COVID-19 pandemic has developed. Currently, a direct role of hypertension, independent of age and other comorbidities, as a risk factor for the SARS-COV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcome, particularly death, has not been established. Similarly, both current experimental and clinical studies do not support an unfavorable effect of RAS-blockers or other classes of first line blood pressure lowering drugs in COVID-19. Here, we review available data on the role of hypertension and its management on COVID-19. Conversely, some aspects as to how the COVID-19 affects hypertension management and impacts on future developments are also briefly discussed. COVID-19 has and continues to proof the critical importance of hypertension research to address questions that are important for global health.","Savoia, Carmine; Volpe, Massimo; Kreutz, Reinhold",Circ Res,,636

463855,Mortality of COVID-19 and Seasonal Influenza in Southern Nevada and the United States,2021,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly pathogenic, transmittable and invasive pneumococcal disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in December 2019 and January 2020 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China and fast spread later on the middle of February 2020 in the Northern part of Italy and Europe. This study investigates the correlation between the degree of accelerated diffusion and lethality of COVID-19 and the surface air pollution in Milan metropolitan area, Lombardy region, Italy. Daily average concentrations of inhalable particulate matter (PM) in two size fractions PM2.5, PM10 and maxima PM10 ground level atmospheric pollutants together air quality and climate variables (daily average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure field and Planetary Boundary Layer-PBL height) collected during 1 January-30 April 2020 were analyzed. In spite of being considered primarily transmitted by indoor bioaerosols droplets and infected surfaces, or direct human-to-human personal contacts, it seems that high levels of urban air pollution, weather and specific climate conditions have a significant impact on the increased rates of confirmed COVID-19 Total number, Daily New and Total Deaths cases, possible attributed not only to indoor but also to outdoor airborne bioaerosols distribution. Our analysis demonstrates the strong influence of daily averaged ground levels of particulate matter concentrations, positively associated with average surface air temperature and inversely related to air relative humidity on COVID-19 cases outbreak in Milan. Being a novel pandemic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) version, COVID-19 might be ongoing during summer conditions associated with higher temperatures and low humidity levels. Presently is not clear if this protein ""spike"" of the new coronavirus COVID-19 is involved through attachment mechanisms on indoor or outdoor airborne aerosols in the infectious agent transmission from a reservoir to a susceptible host in some agglomerated urban areas like Milan is.","Zoran, Maria A; Savastru, Roxana S; Savastru, Dan M; Tautan, Marina N",Sci Total Environ,,636
464134,PNS263 Pandemics and Access to Care: Use of Real-World DATA to Examine the IMPACT of COVID-19 on Pharmacy Visits in JAPAN,2020,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is a novel strain of human beta-coronavirus that has produced over two million deaths and affected one hundred million individuals worldwide. As all the proposed drugs proved to be unstable, inducing side effects, the need to develop a vaccine crystallized in a short time. As a result, we searched the databases for articles in which the authors reported the efficacy and safety of the use of several vaccines vaccines by sex, age group, and frequency of adverse reactions. We identified a total of 19 relevant articles that were discussed throughout this manuscript. We concluded that from all eleven vaccines, three had an efficacy >90% (Pfizer-BioNTech (~95%), Moderna (~94%), and Sputnik V (~92%)) except for Oxford-AstraZeneca (~81%). However, Moderna, Sputnik V, and Oxford-AstraZeneca also alleviate severe adverse reactions, whereas in Pfizer-BioNTech this was not revealed. The remaining five (Convidicea (AD5-nCOV); Johnson & Johnson (Ad26.COV2.S); Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV); Covaxin (BBV152), and Sinovac (CoronaVac)) were discussed based on their immunogenicity, and safety reported by the recipients since only phases 1 and 2 were conducted without clear evidence published regarding their efficacy. CoviVac and EpiVacCorona have just been approved, which is why no published article could be found. All adverse events reported following the administration of one of the four vaccines ranged from mild to moderate; limited exceptions in which the patients either developed severe forms or died, because most effects were dose-dependent. It can be concluded that aforementioned vaccines are efficient and safe, regardless of age and sex, being well-tolerated by the recipients.","Doroftei, Bogdan; Ciobica, Alin; Ilie, Ovidiu-Dumitru; Maftei, Radu; Ilea, Ciprian",Diagnostics (Basel),,636

464513,The Pandemic in the Periphery of Delhi: Covid-19 and Boundary (Re)Making in Peri-Urban India,2020,"Purpose: To determine if sex or age influence whether COVID-19 health care closures affect the health, recovery, and access to resources of pre- and post-operative orthopaedic sport medicine patients. Methods: Electronic questionnaires assessing physical and emotional health, the value of virtual care, and access to resources were distributed to patients with postponed (PP) orthopaedic restorative surgeries and those within three-months post-operative (PO) at the time of the COVID-19 health care closures. The EQ-5D-3L was included as a standardized measure of general health. Chi-square tests compared responses between sexes and age groups. Unpaired t-tests compared the EQ VAS by sex, and a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared the EQ VAS by age. Results: Females in the PO group were more likely to report that their recovery was delayed (49.5% vs 36%) and that closures had negatively affected their recovery (p = 0.013). Females in the PP group reported more symptoms of pain/discomfort on the EQ-5D-3L (p = 0.023). In the PP group, patients aged 25 to 44 years were most likely to identify pain as a concern (p = 0.54). In the PO group, patients younger than 45 years reported a significantly lower mean EQ VAS health state ( p = 0.017). For the final analysis, there were 115 subjects in the PP group and 198 in the PO group. Conclusion: This study demonstrated significant sex- and age-specific differences in health and recovery among orthopaedic sport medicine patients as a result of the COVID-19 health care closures. Females reported significantly more pain, anxiety, and delay in their rehabilitation, while younger patients reported greater negative impacts and worse overall health state.

465496,Medicine and humanism in the time of COVID-19. Ethical choices,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge to surgical residency programs. Due to the restrictions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other organizations, the educational landscape for surgical residents is rapidly changing. In addition, the time course of these changes is undefined. METHODS: We attempt to define the scope of the problem of maintaining surgical resident education while maintaining the safety of residents, educators, and patients. Within the basic framework of limiting in-person gatherings, postponing or canceling elective operations in hospitals, and limiting rotations between sites, we propose innovative solutions to maintain rigorous education. RESULTS: We propose several innovative solutions including the flipped classroom model, online practice questions, teleconferencing in place of in-person lectures, involving residents in telemedicine clinics, procedural simulation, and the facilitated use of surgical videos. Although there is no substitute for hands-on learning through operative experience and direct patient care, these may be ways to mitigate the loss of learning exposure during this time. CONCLUSIONS: These innovative solutions utilizing technology may help to bridge the educational gap for surgical residents during this unprecedented circumstance. The support of national organizations may be beneficial in maintaining rigorous surgical education.","Chick, Robert Connor; Clifton, Guy Travis; Peace, Kaitlin M; Propper, Brandon W; Hale, Diane F; Alseidi, Adnan A; Vreeland, Timothy J",J Surg Educ,,636

Yet, by focusing on household mixing within the home, these local lockdowns have not inflicted the large declines in consumption accompanying the March 2020 national lockdown, which limited all social contact. Our study harnesses a new source of real-time, transaction-level consumption data that we show to be highly correlated with official statistics. The effectiveness of local lockdowns are evaluated applying a difference-in-difference approach which exploits nearby localities not subject to local lockdowns as comparison groups. Our findings indicate that policymakers may be able to contain virus outbreaks $\textit{without}$ killing local economies. However, the ultimate effectiveness of local lockdowns is expected to be highly dependent on co-ordination between regions and an effective system of testing.","Gathergood, John; Guttman-Kenney, Benedict",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04129v2.pdf,636

To design a protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to understand which SARS-CoV-2 specific epitopes can elicit a T cell response and provide protection across a broad population. In this study, PLpro and RdRp, two immunogenic non-structural proteins from an immunodominant gene region ORF1ab, as well as ORF3a and ORF9b are identified as potential vaccine targets against SARS-CoV-2. To select top epitopes for vaccine design, we used various clinical properties, such as antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity and IFN-y secretion. The analysis of CD8 and CD4 T cell epitopes revealed multiple potential vaccine constructs that cover a high percentage of the world population. We identified 8 immunogenic, antigenic, non-allergenic, non-toxic, stable and IFN-y inducing CD8 proteins for nsp3, 4 for nsp12, 11 for ORF3a and 3 for ORF9b that are common across four lineages of variants of concern - B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2, which protect 98.12%, 87.08%, 96.07% and 63.8% of the world population, respectively. We also identified variant specific T cell epitopes that could be useful in targeting each variant strain separately. Including the prediction of mouse MHC affinity towards our top CD8 epitopes, our study revealed a total of 3 immunogenic, antigenic, non-allergenic, non-toxic, stable and IFN-y inducing CD8 epitopes overlapping with 6 antigenic, non-allergenic, non-toxic, stable and IFN-y inducing CD4 epitopes across all four variants of concern which can effectively be utilized in pre-clinical studies. The landscape of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes that we identified can help lead SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development as well as epitope-based peptide vaccine research in the future.","Parn, Simone; Jabbour, Gabriel; Nguyenkhoa, Vincent; Dakshanamurthy, Sivanesan",,,636

In the absence of effective antiviral and limited medical resources, many measures are recommended by WHO to control the infection rate and avoid exhausting the limited medical resources. Wearing mask is among the non-pharmaceutical intervention measures that can be used as barrier to primary route of SARS-CoV2 droplets expelled by presymptomatic or asymptomatic individuals. Regardless of discourse on medical resources and diversities in masks, all countries are mandating coverings over nose and mouth in public areas. Towards contribution of public health, the aim of the paper is to devise a real-time technique that can efficiently detect non mask faces in public and thus enforce to wear mask. The proposed technique is ensemble of one stage and two stage detectors to achieve low inference time and high accuracy. We took ResNet50 as a baseline model and applied the concept of transfer learning to fuse high level semantic information in multiple feature maps. In addition, we also propose a bounding box transformation to improve localization performance during mask detection. The experiments are conducted with three popular baseline models namely ResNet50, AlexNet and MobileNet. We explored the possibility of these models to plug-in with the proposed model, so that highly accurate results can be achieved in less inference time. It is observed that the proposed technique can achieve high accuracy (98.2%) when implemented with ResNet50. Besides, the proposed model can generate 11.07% and 6.44% higher precision and recall respectively in mask detection when compared to RetinaFaceMask detector. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","Sethi, S.; Kathuria, M.; Kaushik, T.",CMES - Computer Modeling in Engineering and Sciences,,636

Efforts are needed to develop rapid and accurate diagnostic tools for extensive testing allowing for effective containment of the infection, via timely identification and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 carriers. Current gold standard nucleic acid tests require many separate steps that need trained personnel to operate specialist instrumentation in laboratory environments, hampering turnaround time and test accessibility, especially in low-resource settings. We devised an integrated on-chip platform coupling RNA extraction based on immiscible filtration assisted by surface tension (IFAST), with RNA amplification and detection via colorimetric reverse-transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), using two sets of primers targeting open reading frame1a (ORF1a) and nucleoprotein (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2. Results were identified visually, with a colour change from pink to yellow indicating positive amplification, and further confirmed by DNA gel electrophoresis. The specificity of the assay was tested against HCoV-OC43 and H1N1 RNAs. The assay based on use of gene N primers was 100% specific to SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity to HCoV-OC43 nor H1N1. Proof-of-concept studies on water and artificial sputum containing genomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA showed our IFAST RT-LAMP device to be capable of extracting and detecting 470 SARS-CoV-2 copies mL-1 within 1 h (from sample-in to answer-out). IFAST RT-LAMP is a simple-to-use, integrated, rapid and accurate COVID-19 diagnostic platform, which could provide an attractive means for extensive screening of SARS-CoV-2 infections at point-of-care, especially in resource-constrained settings.","Rodriguez-Mateos, Pablo Ngamsom Bongkot Walter Cheryl Dyer Charlotte E.; Gitaka, Jesse Iles Alexander Pamme Nicole",Analytica Chimica Acta,,636

Th22 cells display a CCR6+CCR10+ phenotype and could thus respond to CCL20- and CCL28-mediated chemotaxis, while Th17 cells, which express CCR6 but not CCR10, depend on CCL20. Herein, we found that CCL28 is normally expressed by duodenal enterocytes of treated HIV-1-infected individuals, while CCL20 expression is blunted. Ex vivo, we showed that Th22 cells contribute to the reduction of CCL20 production by enterocytes through an IL-22- and IL-18-dependent mechanism. Th22 cells preferentially migrate via CCL20- rather than CCL28-mediated chemotaxis when both chemokines are available in the microenvironment. However, when the CCL20/CCL28 ratio drops, as in treated HIV-1-infected individuals, Th22 cells can migrate via the CCR10-CCL28 axis, as an alternative to CCR6-CCL20. This could explain the better reconstitution of gut Th22 compared with Th17 cells on antiretroviral therapy. Lastly, we assessed the relationships between the frequencies of gut Th17 and Th22 cells and inflammatory markers related to microbial translocation, and showed that Th22 cells do not compensate for the loss of Th17 cells in treated HIV-1-infected individuals.","Nayrac, Manon; Requena, Mary; Loiseau, Claire; Cazabat, Michelle; Suc, Bertrand; Carrere, Nicolas; Barange, Karl; Alric, Laurent; Martin-Blondel, Guillaume; Izopet, Jacques; Delobel, Pierre",,,636

470675,Fear vs. Hope in India: Finding the Silver Lining amid the Dark Clouds of COVID-19,2021,"Rest homes for the elderly have been particularly hit during the crisis due the current COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of writing this article, more than 17,500 elderly people that lived in Care Homes have died due to coronavirus, more than 66% of the deaths. The infection and mortality rates in the institutionalised population are high. This is due to the advanced age, immune system deficit, and the presence of comorbidities, as well as because there are frail, because they live with other residents and carers in a closed institution, and transmission is easy in the context of a highly contagious and virulent virus. The elderly often have more severe forms of the disease. Atypical presentations are more frequent in the elderly and can delay the diagnosis. The Polymer Chain Reaction (PCR) test in the first 7 days for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA is considered the test of reference ('Gold standard'). The criteria for referring to a hospital site from Care Homes should take into account an assessment of comorbidity, the severity, the presence of severe cognitive impairment, and the dependency or necessity of ventilatory support in seriously ill patients. The social-health centres should have contingency plans available in order to offer a response when cases of COVID-19 appear. Isolation during pandemics may have important physical and psychosocial consequences in the residents. It is necessary to reflect and claim a new residential model from a person-centered care approach that seeks the integration of health and social services.","Blanco-Tarrio, E; Blanco Sánchez, G",Semergen,,636

470756,Physiological advantages of children against COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: There is currently a lack of clinical data on the novel beta-coronavirus infection [caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] and concomitant primary lung cancer. Our goal was to report our experiences with 5 patients treated for lung cancer while infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 5 adult patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were admitted to our thoracic surgery unit between 29 January 2020 and 4 March 2020 for surgical treatment of a primary lung cancer. Clinical data and outcomes are reported. RESULTS: All patients were men with a mean age of 74.0 years (range 67-80). Four of the 5 patients (80%) reported chronic comorbidities. Surgery comprised minimally invasive lobectomy (2 patients) and segmentectomy (1 patient), lobectomy with en bloc chest wall resection (1 patient) and pneumonectomy (1 patient). Mean chest drain duration was 12.4 days (range 8-22); mean hospital stay was 33.8 days (range 21-60). SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms were fever (3 patients), persistent cough (3 patients), diarrhoea (2 patients) and syncope (2 patients); 1 patient reported no symptoms. Morbidity related to surgery was 60%; 30-day mortality was 40%. Two patients (1 with a right pneumonectomy, 74 years old; 1 with a lobectomy with chest wall resection and reconstruction, 70 years old), developed SARS-CoV-2-related lung failure leading to death 60 and 32 days after surgery, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer surgery may represent a high-risk factor for developing a severe case of coronavirus disease 2019, particularly in patients with advanced stages of lung cancer. Additional strategies are needed to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection during treatment for lung cancer.","Gonfiotti, Alessandro; Gatteschi, Lavinia; Salvicchi, Alberto; Bongiolatti, Stefano; Lavorini, Federico; Voltolini, Luca",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,,636

471020,Upper limb movements and the risk of unplanned device removal in mechanically ventilated patients,2020,"New corona virus infection (Covid-19) is a pandemic that affects the whole world and progresses with high morbidity and mortality. It has a high contagion rate and a course capable of rapidly lung involvement with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary insuficiency. Severe clinical picture develops as a result of a ""perfect cytokin storm"" as a result of possible immunological mechanisms triggered by viral infection. Immun system disregulation and possible autoinflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms are responsible for higher amount cytokines release from immune cells. Although there is no clear treatment of Covid-19 infection yet, it is argued that some disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be effective in addition to anti-viral treatments. These drugs (antimalarial drugs, colchicum dispert, biologics) have been well known to rheumatologists for years, because they have been used in the treatment of many inflammatory rheumatologic diseases, so now all eyes are on rheumatologists. Another important issue is whether DMARDs, which can cause severe immunosuppression, pose a risk for Covid-19 infection and whether they are discontinued beforehand. Although there are insufficient data on this subject, considering the risk of disease reactivation, patients may continue their DMARDs treatment under the supervision of the rheumatologist. In this article, the possible immunological mechanisms in the pathogenesis of Covid-19 infection and the efficacy and safety of various DMARDs used in the treatment have been discussed with a rheumatologist perspective in the light of recent literature data.","Kobak, Senol",Current rheumatology reviews (Online),,636

There is an urgent need for important Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as N95 and surgical masks. This project examined the factors that were associated with nursing homes' N95 and surgical mask supply. We analyzed data from the Nursing Home COVID-19 Public File and conducted a multivariate logistic regression estimating the association between nursing home characteristics and county-level demographic parameters with mask supply. We found that a high number of resident COVID-19 cases contributed to the supply of N95, but not surgical masks, whereas a high number of staff cases did not lead to an adequate supply of either N95 or surgical masks. Compared with not-for-profit (NFP) facilities, for-profit (FP) nursing homes were less likely to get enough masks. A better supply distribution plan is needed to prepare for future possible PPE shortage.","Li, Yumeng; Fang, Fang; He, Mengying",J Appl Gerontol,,636

With the current COVID-19 pandemic, an even greater need for remote monitoring exists. Mobile tools enhance the ability to monitor patients virtually by enabling remote monitoring of VA and Amsler grid findings. DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter reliability analysis. METHODS: Participants: Patients (N = 108) with near corrected VA better than 20/200 and a diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or healthy patients without retinal disease (best-corrected visual acuity [BCVA] of 20/32 or better). INTERVENTION: participants were tested using the Checkup, reference VA, and Amsler tests, with the order of testing (Checkup or reference) randomized. Patients monitored their vision using Checkup at least twice a week at home between office visits. Main outcome measurements were near corrected VA and Amsler grid test results. RESULTS: Agreement was strong between Checkup and reference tests for VA (r = 0.86) and Amsler grid (sensitivity: 93%; specificity: 92%). Home versus clinic testing showed excellent agreement (r = 0.96). Patients reported successful home use. There were no serious adverse events or discontinuations. Patients rated the usability of Checkup to be excellent. CONCLUSIONS: There was good agreement between Checkup and in-clinic test results for VA and Amsler grid. The low variance of Checkup testing, agreement between in-clinic and home results, and excellent usability support Checkup as a reliable method for monitoring retinal pathology in clinic and home settings.","Khurana, Rahul N; Hoang, Carol; Khanani, Arshad M; Steklov, Nikolai; Singerman, Lawrence J",Am J Ophthalmol,,636
471775,Management strategies for the colonoscopic surveillance of people with Lynch syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Diabetes is a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19, but the pathogenesis remains unclear. We investigated if the association of diabetes and COVID-19 severity may be mediated by inflammation. We also hypothesized that this increased risk may extend to prediabetes. Hospitalized patients in Singapore with COVID-19 were subdivided into three groups in a retrospective cohort: normoglycemia (HbA1c: &#8804;5.6%), prediabetes (HbA1c: 5.7%-6.4%) and diabetes (HbA1c: &#8805;6.5%). The primary outcome of severe COVID-19 was defined by respiratory rate &#8805;30, SpO2 &#8804;93% or intensive care unit admission. The association between clinical factors on severe COVID-19 outcome was analyzed by cox regression. Adjusted mediation analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP) on the relationship between diabetes and severe COVID-19 was performed. Of 1042 hospitalized patients, mean age 39 ± 11 years, 13% had diabetes, 9% prediabetes and 78% normoglycemia. Severe COVID-19 occurred in 4.9% of subjects. Compared to normoglycemia, diabetes was significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on both univariate (hazard ratio [HR]: 9.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.54-17.84; p < .001) and multivariate analysis (HR: 3.99; 95% CI: 1.92-8.31; p < .001), while prediabetes was not a risk factor (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.22-4.03; p = .929). CRP, a biomarker of inflammation, mediated 32.7% of the total association between diabetes and severe COVID-19 outcome. In conclusion, CRP is a partial mediator of the association between diabetes and severe COVID-19 infection, confirming that inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 in diabetes.","Koh, Huilin; Moh, Angela Mei Chung; Yeoh, Ester; Lin, Yi; Low, Serena Kiat Mun; Ooi, Say Tat; Tan, Seng Kiong; Lin, Jaime Hui Xian; Hoong, Caroline Wei Shan",J Med Virol,,636

This scoping review aimed to provide insight into the incidence, patterns, risk factors, histopathological findings, and relationship with disease severity of COVID-19-associated liver injury. Furthermore, we identified existing gaps in the research on the hepatic manifestations of COVID-19 and highlighted areas for future investigations. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Mallay. Five online databases, along with grey literature, were searched for articles published until 22 May 2020, and we included 62 articles in the review. The research domains, methodological characteristics, and key conclusions were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Retrospective observational studies comprised more than one third (41.9%) of the included publications, and 77.8% were conducted on living patients. The incidence of liver injury varied widely across the studies (4.8%-78%), and liver injury was frequently associated with severe COVID-19. We identified the following risk factors for liver injury: male sex, lymphopoenia, gastrointestinal involvement, old age, increased neutrophil count, and the use of hepatotoxic drugs. Histopathological findings indicate that COVID-19 has direct cytopathic effects and causes liver function test derangements secondary to inflammation, hypoxia, and vascular insult. CONCLUSIONS: Liver injury following COVID-19 infection is common and primarily hepatocellular, with a greater elevation of aspartate aminotransferase than of alanine aminotransferase. However, the evidence regarding hepatic failure secondary to COVID-19 is insufficient. Standardised criteria to diagnose liver injury need to be devised. Current use of hepatotoxic drugs necessitates close monitoring of liver function.","Bin Arif, T; Khalid, S; Siddiqui, M S; Hussain, H; Sohail, H",Hong Kong med. j,,636

473462,"COVID-19 and traumatic stress: The role of perceived vulnerability, COVID-19-related worries, and social isolation",2020,"BACKGROUND: Holding conspiracy beliefs regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been associated with reductions in both actions to prevent the spread of the infection (eg, mask wearing) and intentions to accept a vaccine when one becomes available. Patterns of media use have also been associated with acceptance of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. Here we ask whether the type of media on which a person relies increased, decreased, or had no additional effect on that person's COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs over a 4-month period. OBJECTIVE: We used panel data to explore whether use of conservative and social media in the United States, which were previously found to be positively related to holding conspiracy beliefs about the origins and prevention of COVID-19, were associated with a net increase in the strength of those beliefs from March to July of 2020. We also asked whether mainstream news sources, which were previously found to be negatively related to belief in pandemic-related conspiracies, were associated with a net decrease in the strength of such beliefs over the study period. Additionally, we asked whether subsequent changes in pandemic conspiracy beliefs related to the use of media were also related to subsequent mask wearing and vaccination intentions. METHODS: A survey that we conducted with a national US probability sample in March of 2020 and again in July with the same 840 respondents assessed belief in pandemic-related conspiracies, use of various types of media information sources, actions taken to prevent the spread of the disease and intentions to vaccinate, and various demographic characteristics. Change across the two waves was analyzed using path analytic techniques. RESULTS: We found that conservative media use predicted an increase in conspiracy beliefs (ß=.17, 99% CI .10-.25) and that reliance on mainstream print predicted a decrease in their belief (ß=-.08, 99% CI -.14 to -.02). Although many social media platforms reported downgrading or removing false or misleading content, ongoing use of such platforms by respondents predicted growth in conspiracy beliefs as well (ß=.072, 99% CI .018-.123). Importantly, conspiracy belief changes related to media use between the two waves of the study were associated with the uptake of mask wearing and changes in vaccination intentions in July. Unlike other media, use of mainstream broadcast television predicted greater mask wearing (ß=.17, 99% CI .09-.26) and vaccination intention (ß=.08, 95% CI .02-.14), independent of conspiracy beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to the need for greater efforts on the part of commentators, reporters, and guests on conservative media to report verifiable information about the pandemic. The results also suggest that social media platforms need to be more aggressive in downgrading, blocking, and counteracting claims about COVID-19 vaccines, claims about mask wearing, and conspiracy beliefs that have been judged problematic by public health authorities.","Romer, Daniel; Jamieson, Kathleen Hall",J Med Internet Res,,636

Steers with medium frame showed superiority in important marketing aspects such as warm (p 0.0001) and cold carcass (p 0.0001) weights. Muscularity measurements such as longissimus dorsi area in relation to cold carcass (p = 0.0477) and empty body (p = 0.0419) weights were lower for medium-frame steers. Carcass conformation, longissimus dorsi area and cushion thickness were similar in both frame. The commercial cuts, forequarter (p 0.001), flank (p = 0.009) and saw cut (p = 0.0003) in kg were higher for medium-frame steers. Saw cut decreased 0.18% with an increase in frame (p = 0.0404). Weight of the carcass tissues increased with the steers frame, whereas the percentage of muscle tissue decreased 0.57% (p = 0.0410)","Ziegler Arboitte, Miguelangelo; Luiz Brondani, Ivan; Restle, João; da Silva Freitas, Leandro; Braido Pereira, Lucas; dos Santos Cardoso, Gilmar",Acta Sci.

METHODS: In a prospective study, patients from two states in Australia attending dedicated COVID-19 collection clinics were offered the option to first self-collect (SC) nasal and throat swabs (SCNT) prior to health worker collect (HC) using throat and nasal swabs (Site 1) or throat and nasopharyngeal swabs (Site 2). Samples were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 as well as common respiratory viruses. Concordance of results between methods was assessed using Cohen's kappa (&#954;) and Cycle threshold (Ct) values were recorded for all positive results as a surrogate measure for viral load. RESULTS: Of 236 patients sampled by HC and SC, 25 had SARS-CoV-2 (24 by HC and 25 by SC) and 63 had other respiratory viruses (56 by HC and 58 by SC). SC was highly concordant with HC (&#954;â¯=â¯0.890) for all viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and more concordant than HC to positive results by any method (&#954;â¯=â¯0.959 vs 0.933). Mean SARS-CoV-2 E-gene and N-gene, rhinovirus and parainfluenza Ct values did not differ between HC and SCNT. CONCLUSIONS: Self-collection of nasal and throat swabs offers a reliable alternative to health worker collection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses and provides patients with easier access to testing, reduces exposure of the community and health workers to those being tested and reduces requirement for PPE.","Wehrhahn, Michael C; Robson, Jennifer; Brown, Suzanne; Bursle, Evan; Byrne, Shane; New, David; Chong, Smathi; Newcombe, James P; Siversten, Terri; Hadlow, Narelle",J Clin Virol,,636

(Special Issue: COVID preparedness: lessons learned from the pandemic center: issue 2.),2020,"Background: There are more than 258 million international migrants worldwide and the majority reside in countries with ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic outbreaks. International migrants may not receive adequate and timely disease information during epidemics, increasing vulnerability to disease transmission. This is one of very limited studies focusing on international migrants' COVID-19 prevention knowledge and attitudes during the epidemic. Methods: A national cross-sectional online survey was conducted across 100 cities and 26 regions in China from February 17 and March 1, 2020. The sample included 1,426 international migrants representing 77 countries and 6 continents. Knowledge was defined as the number of correct responses to questions about COVID-19. Attitudes included worries, expectations, and general preparedness. Multivariable ordinal logistic regressions evaluated correlates of knowledge and attitudes including information channels and preferences, and trust in Chinese institutions and groups. Results: Just half of the sample, 730/1426 (51.2%) had a good level of knowledge and 656/1426 (46.0%) had a positive attitude towards the COVID-19 epidemic. Knowledge was associated with receiving information through social media (aOR: 2.0, 95%CI: 1.2-3.2), the Internet (aOR: 1.4, 95%CI: 1.2-1.8), the community (aOR: 1.5, 95%CI: 1.2-1.8), and encountering language barriers when receiving medical services (aOR: 0.8, 95%CI: 0.7-1.0). Positive attitude was associated with the level of trust in various Chinese institutions and groups. Conclusions: Roughly half of the sample reported inadequate knowledge and poor attitudes toward prevention and control of COVID-19. Tailored public health campaigns are needed to ensure that international migrants possess adequate knowledge to protect their health during future epidemics and disasters.","Wang, Cheng; Tian, Qi; Zhao, Peizhen; Xiong, Mingzhou; Latkin, Carl A; Gan, Yiqun; Hall, Brian J; Yang, Bin",Int J Biol Sci,,636

476829,Challenges and opportunities in health care and nursing management research in times of COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"The recent coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has negatively impacted the whole economy, especially the oil industry, in at least two ways. First, it created a demand shock as COVID-19 reduced global demand for crude oil, increased uncertainty, and triggered a serious economic recession in most developed and emerging countries. Second, it led to a supply shock as the pandemic resulted in an oil trade war between the major oil-producing nations (Saudi Arabia and Russia). Both shocks led to very high levels of oil price volatility. Our paper explores the dynamics of this volatility and explains the effects of these two shocks (induced by an adjustment of oil demand and supply) on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price volatility. Accordingly, we show that oil price volatility reacted substantially to the pandemic-induced oil shocks. In particular, we document the impact of uncertainty caused by these shocks and investor anxiety on oil price volatility. We show that greater uncertainty leads to more oil price volatility. Our findings remained unchanged even after controlling for modeling robustness. © 2021","Bourghelle, D.; Jawadi, F.; Rozin, P.",International Economics,,636
476830,Challenges and opportunities in health care and nursing management research in times of COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"Since the emergence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in late 2019, domestic cats have been demonstrated to be susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) under natural and experimental conditions. As pet cats often live in very close contact with their owners, it is essential to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infections in cats in a One-Health context. This study reports the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cat in a COVID-19-affected household in Switzerland. The cat (Cat 1) demonstrated signs of an upper respiratory tract infection, including sneezing, inappetence, and apathy, while the cohabiting cat (Cat 2) remained asymptomatic. Nasal, oral, fecal, fur, and environmental swab samples were collected twice from both cats and analyzed by RT-qPCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Both nasal swabs from Cat 1 tested positive. In addition, the first oral swab from Cat 2 and fur and bedding swabs from both cats were RT-qPCR positive. The fecal swabs tested negative. The infection of Cat 1 was confirmed by positive SARS-CoV-2 S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody testing and neutralizing activity in a surrogate assay. The viral genome sequence from Cat 1, obtained by next generation sequencing, showed the closest relation to a human sequence from the B.1.1.39 lineage, with one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) difference. This study demonstrates not only SARS-CoV-2 infection of a cat from a COVID-19-affected household but also contamination of the cats' fur and bed with viral RNA. Our results are important to create awareness that SARS-CoV-2 infected people should observe hygienic measures to avoid infection and contamination of animal cohabitants.","Klaus, Julia; Meli, Marina L; Willi, Barbara; Nadeau, Sarah; Beisel, Christian; Stadler, Tanja; Egberink, Herman; Zhao, Shan; Lutz, Hans; Riond, Barbara; Rösinger, Nina; Stalder, Hanspeter; Renzullo, Sandra; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina",Viruses,,636

A specific adaptation of the Shewhart p-chart, called a funnel chart, was used to compare case fatality rates. Important differences in case fatality rates across the counties did not appear to be reflective of differences in testing or incidence rates. Instead, a higher prevalence of comorbidities and vulnerabilities was observed in high fatality rate counties, while showing no differences in access to acute care. Funnel charts reliably identify counties with unexpected high and low COVID-19 case fatality rates. Social determinants of health are strongly associated with such differences.

477312,Excess mortality analysis for Germany for all three COVID-19 waves in 2020 - 2021,2021,"Unlike developed countries which have purely intensivists also called critical care physicians or intensive care physicians to manage critically ill patients like those with severe forms of COVID-19, the practice of critical care medicine in Africa is coined to anaesthesiology. Hence, anaesthesiologist-intensivist physicians are the medical specialists taking care of critically ill COVID-19 patients in Africa. Likewise, unlike intensive care units (ICUs) in high income countries, those in most African countries face the challenge of a lack of emergency drugs and resuscitation equipment, limited health infrastructure and understaffed and underfunded health care systems. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented one faced by intensivists in high-income countries and anaesthesiologist-intensivist phycisians in Africa. Infected patients with severe forms of the disease like those having grave COVID-19 complications like massive pulmonary embolism, severe cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, septic shock, acute kidney injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome require ICU admission for better management. Both intensivists or anaesthesiologist-intensivist physicians have the peculiarity of securing the airways of critically COVID-19 patients and providing respiratory support with mechanical ventilation after laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation when needed. In so doing, they can easily be infected from respiratory droplets or aerosols expired by the COVID-19 patients. Hence, in Africa, anaesthesiologist-intensivist phycisians have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to other health professionals. It's worth to mention that the COVID-19 pandemic struck African anaesthesiologist-intensivist phycisians and ICUs when there were neither prepared skillfully or lacked the required ICU capacity to meet the demands of thousands of severe COVID-19 African patients. These further weakened the already strained health systems in Africa. It required a lot of creativity, engineering skills and courage for these ill prepared African anaesthesiologist-intensivist physicians to provide care to these critically ill patients and improve their outcomes as the pandemic progressed. However, despites the numerous efforts made in African anaesthesiologist-Intensivist phycisians to care for critically ill COVID-19 patients, the pandemic is spreading at a rapid rate across Africa. There is an urgent need for African health authorities to anticipate on how to scale up the future high ICU capacity needs and limited ICU workforce, infrastructure and equipment to manage severe forms of COVID-19 in future. It cannot be overemphasized that these severe forms of COVID-19 are potentially fatal and are a major contributor to the death toll of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Metogo, Junnette Arlette Mbengono; Tochie, Joel Noutakdie; Etoundi, Paul Owono; Bengono, Roddy Stephan Bengono; Ndikontar, Raymond; Minkande, Jacqueline Ze",Pan Afr Med J,,636

Korea,2020,"mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines offer a preventive strategy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections that is of interest in the care of patients on hemodialysis (HDP). We measured humoral immune responses in 72 HDP after standard vaccination with two doses of the mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech). Antibody responses were evaluated with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ChemiLuminescent ImmunoAssay (CLIA) two weeks after the second dose. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 IgG was determined in a control of 16 healthy healthcare workers (HCW). The control group of HCW has shown a strong antibody response with a median (MD (Q1;Q3)) antibody titer of 800.0 AU/mL (520.5;800.0). In comparison to HCW, HDP under 60 years of age responded equally (597.0 AU/mL (410.5;800.0), p = 0.051). However, the antibody responses of the HDP negatively correlated with age (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.2954 p &lt; 0.0001), leading to significantly lower antibody titers in HDP over 60 years (280.0 AU/mL (45.7;477.0), p &lt; 0.0001). To thoroughly understand the immunogenicity of the new mRNA-based vaccines in HDP, longitudinal data on the effectiveness and durability of antibody responses are needed. Modifications of immunization schedules should be considered in HDP with low or without antibody responsiveness after standard vaccination to boost immune reactivity and prolong protective effects in these vulnerable patients.","Jahn, M.; Korth, J.; Dorsch, O.; Anastasiou, O.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether pregnant women with COVID-19 have virus in their lower genital tract. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we present an analysis of prospectively gathered data collected at a single tertiary university hospital from 19 April to 19 May 2020. We included 13 pregnant women hospitalized with suspected COVID-19. Results of laboratory tests, imaging tests, and nucleic acid tests on vaginal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were also analyzed for pregnant women with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: Twelve pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Mean age was 32 ± 7.9 years. All patients had mild symptoms and were followed in the maternity ward, with none of them needing critical care unit follow-up. All lower genital tract samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2.

478904,A Study of UK Household Wealth through Empirical Analysis and a Non-linear Kesten Process,2021-07-05,"BACKGROUND: Trauma, natural and man-made catastrophic events can be predictors of postpartum psychological distress. In a public health response due to coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, the Italian government imposed a lockdown from March 9 to May 3. This extraordinary situation may have been challenging for maternal psychological health. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms in women giving birth during the Covid-19 pandemic and its associations with quarantine measures, obstetrical factors, and relational attachment style. METHODS: Women who gave birth in a high-volume obstetric/gynaecological medical centre located in an epidemic area during the Covid-19 pandemic (March 8 to June 15) were asked to complete an online survey about their childbirth experience and the perceived effect of the pandemic. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) were administered to assess levels of postpartum depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and relational style of attachment, respectively. Multivariate analysis was applied to identify associations between quarantine measures, childbirth experience, attachment style, and EPDS and IES-R scores. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 163 women (response rate 60.8%). The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 44.2% (EPDS cut-off score &#8805; 11) and the PTSS rate was 42.9% (IES-R cut-off score &#8805; 24). Dismissive and fearful avoidant attachment styles were significantly associated with the risk of depression and PTSS, respectively. Perceived pain during birth was a risk factor for postpartum depression. Perceived support provided by healthcare staff was a protective factor against depression and PTSS. Another protective factor against PTSS was quiet on the ward due to the absence of hospital visitors. CONCLUSION: This study reports a high prevalence of postpartum depressive and PTSS in women who gave birth during the Covid-19 pandemic. Postnatal psychological distress seemed to be associated more with the prenatal experience and other individual factors than with the pandemic hospital restrictions. Early detection during pregnancy of an insecure attachment style is fundamental to provide targeted preventive and therapeutic psychological interventions.","Ostacoli, Luca; Cosma, Stefano; Bevilacqua, Federica; Berchialla, Paola; Bovetti, Marialuisa; Carosso, Andrea Roberto; Malandrone, Francesca; Carletto, Sara; Benedetto, Chiara",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,636
479124,Managing Burns During COVID-19 Outbreak,2020,"Kidney transplant recipients may be at a high risk of developing critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness due to chronic immunosuppression and comorbidities. We identified hospitalized adult kidney transplant recipients at 12 transplant centers in the United States, Italy, and Spain who tested positive for COVID-19. Clinical presentation, laboratory values, immunosuppression, and treatment strategies were reviewed, and predictors of poor clinical outcomes were determined through multivariable analyses. Among 9845 kidney transplant recipients across centers, 144 were hospitalized due to COVID-19 during the 9-week study period. Of the 144 patients, 66% were male with a mean age of 60 (±12) years, and 40% were Hispanic and 25% were African American. Prevalent comorbidities included hypertension (95%), diabetes (52%), obesity (49%), and heart (28%) and lung (19%) disease. Therapeutic management included antimetabolite withdrawal (68%), calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal (23%), hydroxychloroquine (71%), antibiotics (74%), tocilizumab (13%), and antivirals (14%). During a median follow-up period of 52 days (IQR: 16-66 days), acute kidney injury occurred in 52% cases, with respiratory failure requiring intubation in 29%, and the mortality rate was 32%. The 46 patients who died were older, had lower lymphocyte counts and estimated glomerular filtration rate levels, and had higher serum lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, and interleukin-6 levels. In sum, hospitalized kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 have higher rates of acute kidney injury and mortality.","Cravedi, Paolo; Mothi, Suraj S; Azzi, Yorg; Haverly, Meredith; Farouk, Samira S; Pérez-Sáez, María J; Redondo-Pachón, Maria D; Murphy, Barbara; Florman, Sander; Cyrino, Laura G; Grafals, Monica; Venkataraman, Sandheep; Cheng, Xingxing S; Wang, Aileen X; Zaza, Gianluigi; Ranghino, Andrea; Furian, Lucrezia; Manrique, Joaquin; Maggiore, Umberto; Gandolfini, Ilaria; Agrawal, Nikhil; Patel, Het; Akalin, Enver; Riella, Leonardo V",Am. j. transplant,,636

No qualitative study has yet been published describing the experience of physical therapists during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to describe and explore the experiences and perspectives of physical therapists working in public hospitals in Madrid, Spain, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted based on an interpretive framework. Thirty physical therapists working at 11 national public hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak were recruited by purposeful sampling and snowball techniques. In-depth interviews and researchers' field notes were used to collect data. Interviews were transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify emerging themes. RESULTS: After identifying 3912 codes and 13 categories, 3 themes emerged. First theme was ""Call of Duty,"" COVID-19 infection dramatically spread, the hospitals were contaminated and overwhelmed, and all floors were converted into COVID-19 wards. Second theme was ""Working in War Time."" Every day, therapists were given ""the war report,"" receiving their orders, meeting protective personal equipment requirements, and doing a job with fear. Third theme was ""When I Arrive at Home."" Working during the pandemic had an impact on the therapists' families and the information shared with them. CONCLUSIONS: Physical therapists described the COVID-19 outbreak as an apocalyptic and unexpected war. Comprehensive support is needed for all frontline health care professionals. The COVID-19 outbreak revealed that health care systems were not prepared for a pandemic. IMPACT: This is the first qualitative study to be published describing the experience of physical therapists during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Palacios-Ceña, Domingo; Fernández-de-Las-Peñas, César; Palacios-Ceña, María; de-la-Llave-Rincón, Ana I; Florencio, Lidiane L",Phys. ther,,636

480886,The COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis: The Loss and Trauma Event of Our Time,2020,"Replication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is a fundamental step in the virus life cycle and inhibiting the SARS-CoV2 replicase machinery has been proven recently as a promising approach in combating the virus. Despite this recent success, there are still several aspects related to the structure, function and dynamics of the CoV-2 polymerase that still need to be addressed. This includes understanding the dynamicity of the various polymerase subdomains, analyzing the hydrogen bond networks at the active site and at the template entry in the presence of water, studying the binding modes of the nucleotides at the active site, highlighting positions for acceptable nucleotides' substitutions that can be tolerated at different positions within the nascent RNA strand, identifying possible allosteric sites within the polymerase structure and studying their correlated dynamics relative to the catalytic site. Here, we combined various cutting-edge modelling tools with the recently resolved SARS-CoV-2 cryo-EM polymerase structures to fill this gap in knowledge. Our findings provide a detailed analysis of the hydrogen bond networks at various parts of the polymerase structure and suggest possible nucleotides' substitutions that can be tolerated by the polymerase complex. We also report here three 'druggable' allosteric sites within the NSP12 RdRp that can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors. Our correlated motion analysis shows that the dynamics within one of the newly identified sites are linked to the active site, indicating that targeting this site can significantly impact the catalytic activity of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The unprecedented COVID-19 crisis will likely accelerate the implementation of automation and create unique problems involving human-automation trust for naïve users of automated technologies in the future. METHOD: We briefly review factors that can influence the development of human-automation trust amidst and following the COVID-19 pandemic. We focus on two theories on human-automation trust and how naïve users develop and maintain their trust in unfamiliar technologies. RESULTS: The current review identifies user workload and perceived risk as critical factors that will impact human-automation trust during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both theories predict that it is important for naïve users to accumulate and analyze behavioral evidence of automated technologies to maintain appropriate trust levels as the pandemic progresses. CONCLUSION AND APPLICATION: Theories of human-automation trust inform trajectories of trust development toward unfamiliar technologies for naïve users. In application, manufacturers and distributers should focus on communicating system information effectively to retain users who may be ""forced"" to use unfamiliar technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yamani, Yusuke; Long, Shelby K; Itoh, Makoto",Hum Factors,,636
481347,Current regulatory approaches for accessing potential COVID-19 therapies,2020,"BACKGROUND: Intervention measures have been implemented around the world to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding the dynamics of the disease spread and the effectiveness of the interventions is essential in predicting its future evolution. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to simulate the effect of different social distancing interventions and investigate whether their timing and stringency can lead to multiple waves (subepidemics), which can provide a better fit to the wavy behavior observed in the infected population curve in the majority of countries. METHODS: We have designed and run agent-based simulations and a multiple wave model to fit the infected population data for many countries. We have also developed a novel Pandemic Response Index to provide a quantitative and objective way of ranking countries according to their COVID-19 response performance. RESULTS: We have analyzed data from 18 countries based on the multiple wave (subepidemics) hypothesis and present the relevant parameters. Multiple waves have been identified and were found to describe the data better. The effectiveness of intervention measures can be inferred by the peak intensities of the waves. Countries imposing fast and stringent interventions exhibit multiple waves with declining peak intensities. This result strongly corroborated with agent-based simulations outcomes. We also provided an estimate of how much lower the number of infections could have been if early and strict intervention measures had been taken to stop the spread at the first wave, as actually happened for a handful of countries. A novel index, the Pandemic Response Index, was constructed, and based on the model's results, an index value was assigned to each country, quantifying in an objective manner the country's response to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic can be successfully modeled as a series of epidemic waves (subepidemics) and that it is possible to infer to what extent the imposition of early intervention measures can slow the spread of the disease.","Kaxiras, Efthimios; Neofotistos, Georgios",J Med Internet Res,,636
481352,[CME: Hypertension and the COVID-19 Pandemic: What to Consider in Medical Practice],2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been spreading rapidly around the world, while ""multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"" (MIS-C) is a new type of syndrome that has now been reported in many countries. Similar and different characteristics between KD and MIS-C have been reported in a variety of literature. We aimed to focus on reviewing clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of KD and MIS-C. METHODS: We searched articles in the electronic databases, including the Cochrane Library database, EMBASE, and MEDLINE with the keywords ""multiple inflammatory syndrome"" and/or ""COVID-19"" and/or ""Kawasaki disease"" and ""children"". RESULTS: Main presentations of MIS-C and KD include fever, rashes, mucous membrane involvement, conjunctivitis, hands and feet erythema/edema, and cervical lymphadenopathy. However, compared with the highest incidence of KD among some Asian countries, MIS-C is common among Black and Hispanic children. MIS-C is common in older children and teenagers, whereas classic KD is common in children under five years of age. Gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, and coagulopathy are common in MIS-C patients but are not common in classic KD. Cardiac manifestations are more common than KD, including myocarditis with cardiac dysfunction and coronary artery dilation or aneurysms. Severe cases in MIS-C present with vasodilated or cardiogenic shock that requires fluid resuscitation, muscular support, and even mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), whereas KD rarely presents with these manifestations and requires these treatments. Increased serum ferritin, leukopenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia are common in MIS-C. However, thrombocytosis is a characteristic feature of KD. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and moderate-high dose aspirin are still a standard recommended treatment for KD. In addition to the above-mentioned medications, steroids and biological drugs are frequently used in patients with MIS-C. Most of the children with KD have a good prognosis; however, the long-term clinical outcomes of MIS-C are not clear. CONCLUSIONS: The overall presentation and treatment of MIS-C appear to overlap with KD. However, there are still great differences between the syndromes, and it is controversial to say whether MIS-C is a new entity or is a ""severe type"" of KD.","Zhang, Qing-You; Xu, Bo-Wen; Du, Jun-Bao",World j. pediatr,,636

Using the example of a clinic for visceral, transplantation, thorax and vascular surgery (VTTG), the performance development of inpatient care in the first 7 weeks in comparison to the previous year as well as an evaluation of the compensation measures laid down by law were evaluated. METHODOLOGY: Based on the performance figures, a comparison was made between the period from 16 March to 3 May 2019 and the same period in 2020. Changes in the number of cases, case mix, case mix index and day mix index as well as the bed occupancy days were recorded. The monetary measures from the COVID-19 Hospital Relief Act were applied to these changes and the adequacy was evaluated. RESULTS: Compared to the previous year there was a decrease in inpatient admissions of 120 patients during the observation period. As a result there was a decrease of 370 points in case mix and 1433 days of occupancy. For the whole VTTG this resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately 0.8â¯million , which was completely compensated by the flat rate payment for empty beds. The individual areas of the VTTG showed a heterogeneous picture in relation to the compensation for the loss of revenue. Elective units in particular showed a shortfall up to 128,163â¯ with respect to inpatient treatment for 7 weeks. CONCLUSION: The measures taken by the Government are an important support for the economic security of German hospitals. The lack of differentiation of measures by specialty leads to a heterogeneous picture in compensation for VTTG revenues and has to be understood as an alarm signal especially for elective surgical healthcare.","von Dercks, Nikolaus; Seehofer, Daniel; Steinert, Matthias; Krämer, Sebastian; Branzan, Daniela; Dietrich, Arne; Schürmann, Olaf; Gockel, Ines",Chirurg,,636

Moreover, a few recent studies have proposed the combination of protease inhibitors for therapeutic use against SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting the role of viral protease in virus infectivity. In this regard, this review focuses on the analysis, through literature and docking studies, of a number of natural products able to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection, acting both as iron chelators and protease inhibitors.","Carota, Giuseppe Ronsisvalle Simone Panarello Federica Tibullo Daniele Nicolosi Anna Li Volti Giovanni",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,636

While these peaks are symmetric in shape, the peak in coincidence with the COVID-19 pandemics is asymmetric and more pronounced. We fit the former with a Gaussian function and the latter with a Gompertz function, in order to quantify number of casualties, the duration and the position of all causes of excess deaths. The overall quality of the fit to the data turns out to be very good. We discuss the trend of casualties in Italy by different classes of ages and for the different genders.

However, the effectiveness of this approach depends on the adherence of a large segment of the population. OBJECTIVE: Our aims were to estimate, the acceptability in France of a contact tracing app using mobile phones, and to investigate the barriers to its use. METHODS: The Health Literacy Survey 2019 survey questioned 1 003 people in France during the COVID-19 pandemic on the basis of quota sampling. It collected sociodemographic characteristics and health literacy but also information on communication with caregivers, trust in institutions, and COVID-19 knowledge and preventive behaviours. The acceptability of a mobile app for contact tracing was measured by a single question, the responses of which were grouped into three modalities: App-supporting, App-willing and App-reluctant. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with the acceptability of a mobile app in the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Only 19.2% (193 out of 1 003) were App-supporting while half of the participants (n=504, 50.3%) were reluctant. The factors associated with willing or supporting the tracking app were: lower financial deprivation (respectively adjusted Odds Ratio=0.8, 95% Confidence Interval [0.69 - 0.93] and adjusted Odds Ratio=0.7, 95% Confidence Interval [0.58 - 0.84]) and higher perceived usefulness of using a mobile app to send health questionnaires to doctors (respectively adjusted Odds Ratio=2.3, 95% Confidence Interval [1.70 - 3.26] and adjusted Odds Ratio=3.1, 95% Confidence Interval [2.04 - 4.82]). Age over 60 (adjusted Odds Ratio=1.9, 95% Confidence Interval [1.13 - 3.22]), trust in political representatives (adjusted Odds Ratio=2.7, 95% Confidence Interval [1.72 - 4.23]), feeling concerned about the pandemic situation (adjusted Odds Ratio=2.2, 95% Confidence Interval [1.47 - 3.32]), and knowledge about the transmission of COVID-19 (adjusted Odds Ratio=2.0, 95% Confidence Interval [1.39 - 2.96]) increased the likelihood of supporting the tracking app. CONCLUSIONS: The most economically precarious people, who are more at risk of SARS-CoV-2, are also the most reluctant to use a contact tracing app. Therefore, optimal adherence can only be effective with a targeted discourse on public health benefits to adopt such an app which should be combined with a reduction in inequalities by acting on structural determinants.","Touzani, Rajae; Schultz, Emilien; Holmes, Seth M; Vandentorren, Stéphanie; Arwidson, Pierre; Guillemin, Francis; Rey, Dominique; Rouquette, Alexandra; Bouhnik, Anne-Déborah; Mancini, Julien",,,636

In this study, we explored the feasibility of using tracking data from a football match to assess interpersonal contact between individuals by calculating two measures of respiratory exposure. The dynamic tracking positioning of all players and referees during one international football match was analyzed. For each individual, two measures of respiratory exposure were calculated, based on the 2 m interpersonal distance recommendations for contact tracing for COVID-19 control. Overall, individuals spent a median of 0.12 mm:ss (IQR = 0.45 mm:ss) exposed to interpersonal contact of fewer than 2 m from others. The highest value of exposure was observed between two players of opposing teams (6.35 mm:ss). The results suggest that tracking data can be used to assess respiratory exposure to interpersonal contact in team sports, such as football. The measures of exposure calculated can be used to the prompt identification of high-risk contacts of COVID-19 cases during a match or a training session, but also the risk stratification of different sports and physical activities.","Gonçalves, Bruno; Mendes, Romeu; Folgado, Hugo; Figueiredo, Pedro; Travassos, Bruno; Barros, Henrique; Campos-Fernandes, Adalberto; Beckert, Paulo; Brito, João",Sensors (Basel),,636
486793,The Rebooting in Sports and Physical Activities After COVID-19 Italian Lockdown: An Exploratory Study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Frail older persons may have an atypical presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The value of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing for identifying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nursing homes (NHs) residents is not known. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether (i) atypical symptoms may predict rRT-PCR results and (ii) rRT-PCR results may predict immunisation against SARS-CoV-2 in NH residents. DESIGN: A retrospective longitudinal study. SETTING: Eight NHs with at least 10 rRT-PCR-positive residents. SUBJECTS: A total of 456 residents. METHODS: Typical and atypical symptoms recorded in residents' files during the 14 days before and after rRT-PCR testing were analysed. Residents underwent blood testing for IgG-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein 6 to 8 weeks after testing. Univariate and multivariate analyses compared symptoms and immunisation rates in rRT-PCR-positive and negative residents. RESULTS: A total of 161 residents had a positive rRT-PCR (35.3%), 17.4% of whom were asymptomatic before testing. Temperature >37.8°C, oxygen saturation <90%, unexplained anorexia, behavioural change, exhaustion, malaise and falls before testing were independent predictors of a further positive rRT-PCR. Among the rRT-PCR-positive residents, 95.2% developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies vs 7.6% in the rRT-PCR-negative residents. Among the residents with a negative rRT-PCR, those who developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies more often had typical or atypical symptoms (P = 0.02 and <0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study supports a strategy based on (i) testing residents with typical or unexplained atypical symptoms for an early identification of the first SARS-CoV-2 cases, (ii) rT-PCR testing for identifying COVID-19 residents, (iii) repeated wide-facility testing (including asymptomatic cases) as soon as a resident is tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and (iv) implementing SARS-CoV-2 infection control measures in rRT-PCR-negative residents when they have unexplained typical or atypical symptoms.","Blain, Hubert; Gamon, Lucie; Tuaillon, Edouard; Pisoni, Amandine; Giacosa, Nadia; Albrand, Mylène; Miot, Stéphanie; Rolland, Yves; Picot, Marie-Christine; Bousquet, Jean",Age Ageing,,636

Originally, quinine was extracted from the bark of Chinchona trees by South American natives of the Amazon forest, and it has been used to treat fever since the seventeenth century. The recent COVID-19 pandemic caused by Sars-Cov-2 infection has forced researchers to search for ways to prevent and treat this disease. Based on the antiviral potential of two 4-aminoquinoline compounds derived from quinine, known as chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), clinical investigations for treating COVID-19 are being conducted worldwide. However, there are some discrepancies among the clinical trial outcomes.Thus, even after one hundred years of quinine use during the Spanish flu pandemic, the antiviral properties promoted by 4-aminoquinoline compounds remain unclear. The underlying molecular mechanisms by which CQ and HCQ inhibit viral replication open up the possibility of developing novel analogs of these drugs to combat COVID-19 and other viruses.","Bazotte, Roberto Barbosa; Hirabara, Sandro Massao; Serdan, Tamires Afonso Duarte; Gritte, Raquel Bragante; Souza-Siqueira, Talita; Gorjao, Renata; Masi, Laureane Nunes; Antunes, Marina Masetto; Cruzat, Vinicius; Pithon-Curi, Tania Cristina; Curi, Rui",Biomed Pharmacother,,636

488368,Compliance with immunosuppression for rheumatic disease during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that COVID-19-associated severe respiratory failure (CARDS) might differ from usual acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to failing autoregulation of pulmonary vessels and higher shunt. We sought to investigate pulmonary hemodynamics and ventilation properties in patients with CARDS compared to patients with ARDS of pulmonary origin. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from consecutive adults with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patients treated in our ICU in 04/2020 and a comparison of the data to matched controls with ARDS due to respiratory infections treated in our ICU from 01/2014 to 08/2019 for whom pulmonary artery catheter data were available. RESULTS: CARDS patients (n = 10) had ventilation characteristics similar to those of ARDS (n = 10) patients. Nevertheless, mechanical power applied by ventilation was significantly higher in CARDS patients (23.4 ± 8.9 J/min) than in ARDS (15.9 ± 4.3 J/min; P < 0.05). COVID-19 patients had similar pulmonary artery pressure but significantly lower pulmonary vascular resistance, as cardiac output was higher in CARDS vs. ARDS patients (P < 0.05). Shunt fraction and dead space were similar in CARDS compared to ARDS (P > 0.05) and were correlated with hypoxemia in both groups. The arteriovenous pCO2 difference (âµpCO2) was elevated (CARDS 5.5 ± 2.8 mmHg vs. ARDS 4.7 ± 1.1 mmHg; P > 0.05), as was the P(v-a)CO2/C(a-v)O2 ratio (CARDS mean 2.2 ± 1.5 vs. ARDS 1.7 ± 0.8; P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients seems to differ only slightly from ARDS regarding ventilation characteristics and pulmonary hemodynamics. Our data indicate microcirculatory dysfunction. More data need to be collected to assure these findings and gain more pathophysiological insights into COVID-19 and respiratory failure.","Becker, André; Seiler, Frederik; Muellenbach, Ralf M; Danziger, Guy; Kamphorst, Maren; Lotz, Christopher; Bals, Robert; Lepper, Philipp M",J Intensive Care Med,,636

SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell through a specific receptor (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) expressed on epithelial cells of various tissues. The virus, by inducing cell apoptosis and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, generates as cytokine storm, which is the major cause of mortality in the patients. This type of response, along with responses by other immune cell, such as alveolar macrophages and neutrophils causes extensive damage to infected tissue. Newly, a novel cell-based therapy by Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) as well as by their exosomes has been developed for treatment of COVID-19 that yielded promising outcomes. In this review study, we discuss the characteristics and benefits of MSCs therapy as well as MSC-secreted exosome therapy in treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Dauletova, Meruyert; Hafsan, Hafsan; Mahhengam, Negah; Zekiy, Angelina Olegovna; Ahmadi, Majid; Siahmansouri, Homayoon",Clin Immunol,,636

We investigated the relationship between trust in scientists and medical professionals and perceptions of vaccine safety and effectiveness. We also build on past studies by exploring the relationship between confidence in global health organizations and vaccine hesitancy. Methods: We conducted an online survey in seventeen countries/territories across five world regions between May -June 2020. We assessed the relationship between COVID19 vaccine hesitancy, confidence in public health organizations, and trust in key experts and leaders. Results: Our findings strongly suggest that confidence in the World Health Organization combined with trust in domestic scientists and healthcare professionals is a strong driver of vaccine acceptance across multiple countries/territories. Conclusion: We find that hesitancy is widespread, and uptake would be insufficient to achieve herd immunity. There is widespread confidence in how public health organizations have responded to the current pandemic and this is related to vaccine acceptance. Our results also highlight the important role of trust in health care providers and scientists in reducing COVID19 vaccine hesitancy.","Rozek, L.

Such information may in turn be used for reducing geometric uncertainties during therapeutic planning, dose delivery and response assessment. However, given the multiple imaging modalities and/or contrasts potentially included within the imaging protocol over the course of the treatment, the current manual approach to determining tissue displacement may become time-consuming and error prone. In this context, variational multi-modal deformable image registration (DIR) algorithms allow automatic estimation of tumor and OAR deformations across the acquired images. In addition, they require short computational times and a low number of input parameters, which is particularly beneficial for online adaptive applications, which require on-the-fly adaptions with the patient on the treatment table. However, the majority of such DIR algorithms assume that all structures across the entire field-of-view (FOV) undergo a similar deformation pattern. Given that various anatomical structures may behave considerably different, this may lead to the estimation of anatomically implausible deformations at some locations, thus limiting their validity. Therefore, in this paper we propose an anatomically-adaptive variational multi-modal DIR algorithm, which employs a regionalized registration model in accordance with the local underlying anatomy. The algorithm was compared against two existing methods which employ global assumptions on the estimated deformations patterns. Compared to the existing approaches, the proposed method has demonstrated an improved anatomical plausibility of the estimated deformations over the entire FOV as well as displaying overall higher accuracy. Moreover, despite the more complex registration model, the proposed approach is very fast and thus suitable for online scenarios. Therefore, future adaptive IGRT workflows may benefit from an anatomically-adaptive registration model for precise contour propagation and dose accumulation, in areas showcasing considerable variations in anatomical properties.","Zachiu, Cornel; Denis de Senneville, Baudouin; Willigenburg, Thomas; van der Voort van Zyp, Jochem R N; de Boer, J C J; Raaymakers, Bas W; Ries, Mario G",Phys. med. biol,,636

The robots operate by executing cycles of the states wait-look-compute-move. They are oblivious, indistinguishable, anonymous, and do not communicate via message passing. First, we solve the uniform circle formation problem while assuming the robots to be transparent.

Because they transport oxygen, red blood cells (RBCs) may play a role in the severity of hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients. The present study combines state-of-the-art metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics approaches to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on RBCs from 23 healthy subjects and 29 molecularly diagnosed COVID-19 patients. RBCs from COVID-19 patients had increased levels of glycolytic intermediates, accompanied by oxidation and fragmentation of ankyrin, spectrin beta, and the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band 3 (AE1). Significantly altered lipid metabolism was also observed, in particular, short- and medium-chain saturated fatty acids, acyl-carnitines, and sphingolipids. Nonetheless, there were no alterations of clinical hematological parameters, such as RBC count, hematocrit, or mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, with only minor increases in mean corpuscular volume. Taken together, these results suggest a significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on RBC structural membrane homeostasis at the protein and lipid levels. Increases in RBC glycolytic metabolites are consistent with a theoretically improved capacity of hemoglobin to off-load oxygen as a function of allosteric modulation by high-energy phosphate compounds, perhaps to counteract COVID-19-induced hypoxia. Conversely, because the N-terminus of AE1 stabilizes deoxyhemoglobin and finely tunes oxygen off-loading and metabolic rewiring toward the hexose monophosphate shunt, RBCs from COVID-19 patients may be less capable of responding to environmental variations in hemoglobin oxygen saturation/oxidant stress when traveling from the lungs to peripheral capillaries and vice versa.","Thomas, Tiffany; Stefanoni, Davide; Dzieciatkowska, Monika; Issaian, Aaron; Nemkov, Travis; Hill, Ryan C; Francis, Richard O; Hudson, Krystalyn E; Buehler, Paul W; Zimring, James C; Hod, Eldad A; Hansen, Kirk C; Spitalnik, Steven L; D039,; Alessandro, Angelo",J Proteome Res,,636

The cardiovascular mechanisms of injury are poorly understood and speculative. We aim to use multimodality cardiac imaging including cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) and positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose integrated with computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) to identify the cardiac pathophysiological mechanisms related to COVID-19 infections. METHODS: This is a single-centre exploratory observational study aiming to recruit 50 patients with COVID-19 infection who will undergo cardiac biomarker sampling. Of these, 30 patients will undergo combined CTCA and 18F-FDG-PET/CT, followed by CMR. Prevalence of obstructive and non-obstructive atherosclerotic coronary disease will be assessed using CTCA. CMR will be used to identify and characterise myocardial disease including presence of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, myocardial oedema and myocardial infarction. 18F-FDG-PET/CT will identify vascular and cardiac inflammation. Primary endpoint will be the presence of cardiovascular pathology and the association with troponin levels. DISCUSSION: The results of the study will identify the presence and modality of cardiac injury associated COVID-19 infection, and the utility of multi-modality imaging in diagnosing such injury. This will further inform clinical decision making during the pandemic.

The present study undertakes a scoping review of research focused on telehealth in otolaryngology (teleotolaryngology) to identify key themes and commonly utilized outcome measures that will assist future development in this growing field. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases and reference review. REVIEW METHODS: Per guidelines of the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews, we performed database queries using a comprehensive search strategy developed in collaboration with research librarians at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. We identified 596 unique references to undergo title and abstract review by 2 independent reviewers, leaving 439 studies for full-text review. RESULTS: We included 285 studies for extraction of notable findings, leaving 262 unique studies after accounting for content overlap. We identified core outcome measures, including patient and provider satisfaction, costs and benefits, quality of care, feasibility, and access to care. Publication volume increased markedly over time, though only 4% of studies incorporated randomized study group assignment. Using an iterative approach to thematic development, we organized article content across 5 main themes: (1) exploration of teleotolaryngology evolution, (2) role in virtual clinical encounters, (3) applications in interdisciplinary care and educational initiatives, (4) emerging and innovative technologies, and (5) barriers to implementation. CONCLUSION: This scoping review of teleotolaryngology documents its evolution and identifies current use cases, limitations, and emerging applications, providing a foundation from which to build future studies, inform policy decision making, and facilitate implementation where appropriate.","Gonzalez, Joseph N; Axiotakis, Lucas G; Yu, Victoria X; Gudis, David A; Overdevest, Jonathan B",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,636

491188,Postacute Care Preparedness for COVID-19: Thinking Ahead,2020,"BACKGROUND: Training for new and existing child protection system (CPS) caseworkers is critical to developing and maintaining a competent workforce that effectively works towards safety, permanency, and wellbeing outcomes for children in the system. The COVID-19 pandemic required a shift to virtual training to continue training CPS professionals safely. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our project was to determine if there were differences in learning outcomes between learners who completed training in the usual delivery methods (Pre-COVID) and the fully virtual delivery methods (Post-COVID). We also sought to understand any factors that facilitated or impeded successful virtual training during the pandemic. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Caseworkers-in-training completed learning and satisfaction assessments through standard continuing quality improvement efforts. Training facilitators, course developers, and leadership completed qualitative interviews. METHODS: We assessed quantitative differences in one US state in learner knowledge, satisfaction, and behaviors before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and conducted a qualitative thematic analysis of interviews with training system employees. RESULTS: Overall, there were limited differences in learner outcomes before and after the transition to virtual training delivery. Across the employee interviews, three main themes emerged: organizational culture facilitated the transition, external constraints caused challenges during the transition, and there were opportunities to evolve training practices positively. CONCLUSIONS: The shift to a virtual learning environment had little impact on learner knowledge or satisfaction. Employee perspectives indicated that the pre-COVID investment in organizational culture has substantial dividends for performance during the crisis.","Schwab-Reese, Laura M; Drury, Ida; Allan, Heather; Matz, Kasey",Child Abuse Negl,,636
492142,Afterthoughts from an Unexpected Morbidity under COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"In the current COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has been quantified in wastewater in various countries, and wastewater based epidemiology has been proposed as a potential early warning tool for new outbreaks. However, even taking into account that poorly treated wastewater and sewage sludge may be spread on soils, there is no published paper dealing with the quantification of the virus in soil-related liquid samples, as could be runoff, leachates, or soil solution. To fill this gap, the authors of this piece propose reflections on the development of a methodological approach for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 (and eventually other pathogens) in soil-related liquid samples.","Conde-Cid, Manuel; Arias-Estévez, Manuel; Núñez-Delgado, Avelino",Environ Pollut,,636
492154,Experiences of New Zealand registered nurses of Chinese ethnicity during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Background: Incidence and mortality from COVID-19 are starkly elevated in poor, minority and marginalized communities. These differences reflect longstanding disparities in income, housing, air quality, preexisting health status, legal protections, and access to health care. The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences have made these ancient disparities plainly visible. Methodology: As scholars in Catholic research universities committed to advancing both scientific knowledge and social justice, we examined these disparities through the lenses of both epidemiology and ethics. Findings: We see these widening disparities as not only as threats to human health, societal stability, and planetary health, but also as moral wrongs - outward manifestations of unrecognized privilege and greed. They are the concrete consequences of policies that promote structural violence and institutionalize racism. Recommendations: We encourage governments to take the following three scientific and ethical justified actions to reduce disparities, prevent future pandemics, and advance the common good: (1) Invest in public health systems; (2) Reduce economic inequities by making health care affordable to all; providing education, including early education, to all children; strengthening environmental and occupational safeguards; and creating more just tax structures; and (3) Preserve our Common Home, the small blue planet on which we all live.","Landrigan, Philip J; Ferrer, Lilian; Keenan, James",Ann Glob Health,,636

METHODS: Three N95 masks of different makes (A, B and C) were subjected to six decontamination methods: ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) dip, plasma sterilization (Sterrad®), ethylene oxide (ETO, 3M®), dry heat sterilization, and moist heat sterilization (autoclaving). The integrity of the N95 masks was assessed by measuring their particle filtering efficiency at particle sizes ranging 0.3-0.5 microns. RESULTS: All the masks decontaminated with ETO and plasma sterilization retained over 95% particle filtering efficiency. Masks decontaminated using IPA dip and autoclaving showed a drop, and UV irradiation showed variations in particle size efficiency degradation after decontamination. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma sterilization is recommended for decontamination of N95 masks in low-resource settings. ETO is not recommended due to hazards associated with handling of ethylene oxide, although the filtering efficiency was retained. Since the UV irradiation method showed variations in results, evaluation of UV decontamination for N95 masks needs to be performed on a case-by-case basis.","Rohit, Anusha; Rajasekaran, Shankar; Shenoy, Suchitra; Rai, Sumit; Iddya, Karunasagar; Dorairajan, Suresh Kumar",Int J Infect Dis,,636

(2) Methods: Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to explore the influence of different factors on people's behavior of mask-wearing in the present study. R3.6.2 was used for data cleaning, SPSS 26.0 was used to conduct corresponding statistical analysis, and a two-sided p-value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. (3) Results: According to our study, the proportion of participants who wore face masks was higher than 90.0% in both surveys. Single factor analysis showed that the proportion of people wearing face masks raised with the increase of people's education, age, and monthly income (Yuan) in both surveys. People who lived in rural areas were less likely to wear masks. Mask-wearing rate was lower in the isolated individuals than in the non-isolated ones. (4) Conclusions: Masks-wearing is one of the effective measures for COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control. After the Chinese government made wearing face masks mandatory in public places, most residents in China had developed the habit of wearing masks, contributing to the high rate of masks-wearing in China. However, people in rural areas need to raise their awareness of wearing masks. Meanwhile, the mask-wearing of the isolated individuals needs to be enhanced.","Zhang, Ling; Zhu, Sirong; Yao, Hui; Li, Mengying; Si, Guanglin; Tan, Xiaodong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,636

493329,A Conceptual Framework for Rescheduling Elective Pediatric Gastroenterology Procedures following Covid-19 Pandemic Lockdown,2020,"Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) are now a prominent policy instrument for conserving tropical forests PES are voluntary, direct, and contractual: an ES buyer pays an ES steward for adopting conservation practices for a fixed term A defining feature of PES is its ‘quid pro quo’ conditionality, e g stewards are paid only if they deliver contracted conservation outcomes Most studies on PES effectiveness focus on the steward’s compliance with contract conditions By contrast, the buyer’s compliance has received scant attention despite the fact that PES programs across the globe have delayed payments, suspended re-enrollment, or shut down altogether ‘Use-restricting’ PES depend on the continued flow of funding to pay for conservation;however, institutional, political, and economic factors can disrupt or terminate PES funding What happens when the PES money unexpectedly runs out? Do stewards continue to conserve or revert to their former practices? We use mixed methods to study equity concerns and forest outcomes of an unexpected, two-year interruption in conservation payments to 63 private landowners residing in Ecuador’s Amazon and enrolled in the Socio Bosque program, compared to similar landowners who did not enroll Using quasi-experimental methods, we found that during the payment suspension period enrolled properties did not maintain their conservation outcomes where deforestation pressures were high (e g close to roads) Where deforestation pressures were low, enrolled properties continued to conserve more, on average, than similar properties not enrolled Findings from 40 interviews and 26 focus groups conducted before, during, and after the payment suspension exposed profound landowner uncertainty regarding their contract rights Poor official communication and imbalanced PES contract terms reinforced power inequalities between the state and rural ES stewards Our work highlights the need to plan for financial volatility and to protect participants’ rights in PES contract design",,World Development,,636
493745,Racial Disparities in COVID-19-related Deaths in Brazil: Black Lives Matter?,2021,"Brazil ranks second in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. In spite of this, coping measures differ throughout the national territory, as does the disease's impact on the population. This cross-sectional observational study, with 59 695 cases of COVID-19 registered in the state of Alagoas between March and August 2020, analysed clinical-epidemiological variables, incidence rate, mortality rate, case fatality rate (CFR) and the social indicators municipal human development index (MHDI) and social vulnerability index (SVI). Moran statistics and regression models were applied. Logistic regression analysis was applied to determine the predictors of death. The incidence rate was 1788.7/100 000 inhabitants; mortality rate was 48.0/100 000 and CFR was 2.7%. The highest incidence rates were observed in municipalities with better human development (overall MHDI (I = 0.1668; p = 0.002), education MHDI (I = 0.1649; p = 0.002) and income MHDI (I = 0.1880; p = 0.005)) and higher social vulnerability (overall SVI (I = 0.0599; p = 0.033)). CFR was associated with higher social vulnerability (SVI human capital (I = 0.0858; p = 0.004) and SVI urban infrastructure (I = 0.0985; p = 0.040)). Of the analysed cases, 55.4% were female; 2/3 were Black or Brown and the median age was 41 years. Among deaths, most were male (919; 57.4%) and elderly (1171; 73.1%). The predictors of death were male sex, advanced age and the presence of comorbidities. In Alagoas, Brazil, the disease has undergone a process of interiorisation and caused more deaths in poorer municipalities. The presence of comorbidities and advanced age were predictors of death.","Baggio, Jussara Almeida Oliveira; Machado, Michael Ferreira; Carmo, Rodrigo Feliciano do; Armstrong, Anderson da Costa; Santos, Alan Dantas Dos; Souza, Carlos Dornels Freire de",Epidemiol Infect,,636
493949,Drinking to Cope in the COVID-19 Era: An Investigation Among College Students,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The 8-week lockdown for the Covid-19 epidemic in France restricted travel, and interrupted schooling and sports. The study hypothesis was that this exceptional situation temporarily altered childhood trauma epidemiology. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective study was performed during the 8 weeks of lockdown. Pediatric traumatology emergency activity was compared to that during the same period in the previous 3 years. RESULTS: During lockdown, emergency consultations decreased by 50%. The number of patients operated on was 86% of that in the previous 3 years. Patients operated on during lockdown had a mean age of 7.6 years (median, 7.5 years) compared to 9.3 years (9.4 years). The rate of domestic accidents (59% versus 23%) and trampoline accidents (16% versus 5%) increased, while those of sport and locomotion-related accidents decreased. Wounds were more frequent, at 35% of procedures, versus 13% previously. The rate of surgery for upper-limb fracture deceased, while that of lower-limb fracture was unchanged. Distal forearm fracture was less frequent, as was distal tibial fracture. DISCUSSION: The present study found a 50% decrease in pediatric traumatology emergency activity during lockdown, without decrease in surgery. In case of renewed lockdown, we recommend reorganizing emergency admission to free teams for management of Covid-19 patients, while maintaining operative rooms for emergency surgery. A general public information campaign could help prevent domestic accidents and risk related to use of trampolines.

495310,Safe esophageal function testing during the COVID-19 pandemic: A modified surgical mask for patients,2020,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 patients often undergo a high-resolution CT scan to determine extent of their lung involvement. The aim of this study was to determine lung involvement in confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients (encountered at an independent radiology practice) and its correlation to vaccination status amidst the second COVID-19 wave in India. MethodsWe retrospectively queried our data since April 2021 to identify adult patients (>17 years) who had confirmed (positive RT-PCR or antigen test) or suspected COVID-19 (classic symptoms but negative RT-PCR) and received a high-resolution CT scan to determine the extent of their lung involvement using the CT severity (CORAD) score. Patients were classified in 3 groups based on their vaccination status to determine its correlation with the CORAD score: fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated, and unvaccinated. Basic descriptive statistics, univariate tests and multivariate linear regression analysis were used. ResultsWe identified 229 patients (median age 45 years, 60% male) of which 205 (89%) had confirmed COVID-19 (positive RT-PCR) and 24 had suspected disease (negative RT-PCT but classic symptoms). Of the 229 patients 29 (13%) had complete vaccination, 38 (17%) had partial vaccination and 162 (70%) had no vaccination. The CT score of the completely vaccinated patients was significantly lower compared to partially or unvaccinated patients (median 0 v. 3.5 v. 10, respectively p<.01). A multivariate linear regression model showed that partial or fully vaccinated patients had lower CT severity score compared to unvaccinated patients (adjusted R squared = 0.47). ConclusionWe present here the real-world findings from an independent radiology practice (a unique and common practice model), in India amid the second COVID-19 wave showing significantly lower CT severity score in fully or partially vaccinated patients compared to unvaccinated patients. Complete vaccination in patients could be critical in preventing severe lung disease.","Lakhia, Revat T; Trivedi, Jaimin",,,636

496221,Conducting qualitative interviews using virtual communication tools amid COVID-19 pandemic: A learning opportunity for future research,2020,"WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease that has spread across the world and infected a large number of people many of whom have died. People with moderate to severe dementia are at very high risk of becoming infected as the disease mainly impacts on older people with other health problems and once infected the person with dementia is more likely to become seriously ill than other people. To prevent infection, people are required to wear masks and isolate from contact with others. It is believed that these measures can reduce the quality of life and general well-being of people with moderate to severe dementia in hospital or social care. This belief has not yet been demonstrated by research. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO THE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: We show that people with moderate to severe dementia receiving care on mental health hospital wards and subject to strict infection prevention measures can still achieve high levels of well-being. We show that mental health nurses alter the focus of their care to deliberately overcome the challenges and particularly the restrictions on visiting by families. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: We believe that the changes in practice we observed can occur in other healthcare and social care settings and that whilst restrictions remain in place care staff can protect and possibly enhance well-being for people with moderate to severe dementia. ABSTRACT: Introduction The effect of coronavirus (COVID-19) on people living with dementia is potentially severe in its clinical impacts. More widely, for this vulnerable group, the social restrictions to limit the spread of infection may be emotionally and psychologically damaging. Aim To explore the impact of restrictions on well-being for people with moderate to severe dementia in acute mental health hospital care. Method ""Dementia Care Mapping"" was the observational tool used to determine well- or ill-being. Observations were undertaken in two mental health hospital wards during a time of restrictions and the use of personal protective equipment. Results We report levels of well-being that are higher than might be expected alongside a change in the focus of psychological care delivered through mental health nursing interventions aimed at enhancing well-being. Discussion-We postulate that mental health nurses faced with an unprecedented challenge respond by changing practice to mitigate for infection prevention measures and to compensate for family absence. Implications for practice We suggest that the desirable enhancing actions by nursing staff which raise well-being in these hospital settings are readily transferable to other settings that are aiming to maintain well-being but also practising under COVID-19 restrictions.","Page, Sean; Davies-Abbott, Ian; Jones, Adrian",J. psychiatr. ment. health nurs,,636

497167,Medical and Surgical Education Challenges and Innovations in the COVID-19 Era: A Systematic Review,2020,"Isodeoxyelephantopin (IDET) has been identified as an anti-tumor natural constituent whose anti-tumor activity and mechanism have been widely investigated. Since the occurrence and development of cancer usually accompany with inflammation, and tumor signaling shares many components with inflammation signaling, the agents with anti-tumor activity are likely to possess anti-inflammation potential. Thus, the current study aims to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory activity along with the underlying mechanism of IDET in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed macrophages. By using Griess method and ELISA, we found that in both bone marrow derived macrophages and alveolar macrophage cell line, IDET, at relatively low concentrations (0.75, 1.5 and 3 µM), could inhibit LPS-induced expression of various pro-inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide (NO) generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and IL-1ß. Meanwhile, in activated MH-S cells, the inhibitory action of IDET on mRNA expression levels of these cytokines was also detected using qPCR. Mechanistically, the effects of IDET on two key inflammatory signalings, nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) pathways, were determined in LPS-activated MH-S cells by reporter gene along with western blot assays. On the one hand, IDET suppressed NF-&#954;B signaling via down-regulating phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor of NF-&#954;B (I&#954;B)-&#945; and the subsequent p65 translocation. On the other hand, IDET dampened AP-1 signaling through attenuating phosphorylation of both c-jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2) and extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Our study indicates that IDET might be a promising constituent from the anti-inflammatory herb Elephantopus scaber Linn. in mitigating inflammatory conditions, especially respiratory inflammation.","Han, Yixin; Li, Ximeng; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Gao, Yuan; Qi, Ruijuan; Cai, Runlan; Qi, Yun",Int Immunopharmacol,,636

498260,Competing during a pandemic? Retailers' ups and downs during the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"Incidence of hip fractures has remained unchanged during the pandemic with overlapping vulnerabilities observed in patients with hip fractures and those infected with COVID-19. We aimed to investigate the independent impact of COVID-19 infection on the mortality of these patients. Healthcare databases were systematically searched over 2-weeks from 1st-14th November 2020 to identify eligible studies assessing the impact of COVID-19 on hip fracture patients. Meta-analysis of proportion was performed to obtain pooled values of prevalence, incidence and case fatality rate of hip fracture patients with COVID-19 infection. 30-day mortality, excess mortality and all-cause mortality were analysed using a mixed-effects model. 22 studies reporting 4015 patients were identified out of which 2651 (66%) were assessed during the pandemic. An excess mortality of 10% was seen for hip fractures treated during the pandemic (OR 2.00, p = 0.007), in comparison to the pre-pandemic controls (5%). Estimated mortality of COVID-19 positive hip fracture patients was four-fold (RR 4.59, p < 0.0001) and 30-day mortality was 38.0% (HR 4.73, p < 0.0001). The case fatality rate for COVID-19 positive patients was 34.74%. Between-study heterogeneity for the pooled analysis was minimal (I2 = 0.00) whereas, random effects metaregression identified subgroup heterogeneity for male gender (p < 0.001), diabetes (p = 0.002), dementia (p = 0.001) and extracapsular fractures (p = 0.01) increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 positive patients.","Raheman, Firas J; Rojoa, Djamila M; Nayan Parekh, Jvalant; Berber, Reshid; Ashford, Robert",Sci Rep,,636

Multimodal treatment consisting of three modalities - chemotherapy, radiotherapy and cytoreductive surgery is optimal. The use of new therapeutic modalities, such as hyperthermic intraoperative intrapleural chemotherapy or photodynamic therapy can improve the current results of mesothelioma treatment. Combined hyperthermic intraoperative chemotherapy and cytoreductive surgery as part of multimodal therapy of malignant mesothelioma has been used since 2017 at the 1st Department of Surgery of University Hospital Olomouc. The authors report the case of a 47-year-old man with malignant epithelioid mesothelioma of the left pleural cavity. Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, this patient underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy with intraoperative intracavitary hyperthermic chemotherapy. The postoperative period was complicated by circulatory instability and later by tension fluidothorax with signs of heart failure.

499225,Departmental Experience and Lessons Learned With Accelerated Introduction of Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Crisis,2020,"Recently, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, dependence on Contact Tracing (CT) models has significantly increased to prevent spread of this highly contagious virus and be prepared for the potential future ones. Since the spreading probability of the novel coronavirus in indoor environments is much higher than that of the outdoors, there is an urgent and unmet quest to develop/design efficient, autonomous, trustworthy, and secure indoor CT solutions. Despite such an urgency, this field is still in its infancy. The paper addresses this gap and proposes the Trustworthy Blockchain-enabled system for Indoor Contact Tracing (TB-ICT) framework. The TB-ICT framework is proposed to protect privacy and integrity of the underlying CT data from unauthorized access. More specifically, it is a fully distributed and innovative blockchain platform exploiting the proposed dynamic Proof of Work (dPoW) credit-based consensus algorithm coupled with Randomized Hash Window (W-Hash) and dynamic Proof of Credit (dPoC) mechanisms to differentiate between honest and dishonest nodes. The TB-ICT not only provides a decentralization in data replication but also quantifies the node's behavior based on its underlying credit-based mechanism. For achieving high localization performance, we capitalize on availability of Internet of Things (IoT) indoor localization infrastructures, and develop a data driven localization model based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensor measurements. The simulation results show that the proposed TB-ICT prevents the COVID-19 from spreading by implementation of a highly accurate contact tracing model while improving the users' privacy and security.","Salimibeni, Mohammad; Hajiakhondi-Meybodi, Zohreh; Mohammadi, Arash; Wang, Yingxu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08275v1.pdf,636

Among these challenges are the possible negative implications for the mental health and well-being of older persons that ongoing social distancing measures may cause. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing body of literature explored the associations between grandchild caregiving, loneliness and social isolation. We summarize the existing literature on this topic. An association between the provision of grandchild care and reduced feelings of loneliness was found in cross-sectional studies; however, a longitudinal study identified possible gender differences in the impact of grandchild care on feelings of loneliness, with the commencement of grandchild care linked to grandfathers feeling lonelier. At the conclusion of the summary, we highlight the need for further research in this field. Further research is of particular relevance given the drastic changes to the way families and older people interact socially, brought about by the COVID-19 global pandemic.","Quirke, Eleanor; König, Hans-Helmut; Hajek, André",Z.

The purpose of this study was to detail the international impact of COVID-19 among otolaryngologists, and to identify instructional cases. METHODS: Country representatives of the Young Otolaryngologists-International Federation of Otolaryngologic Societies (YO-IFOS) surveyed otolaryngologists through various channels. Nationwide surveys were distributed in 19 countries. The gray literature and social media channels were searched to identify reported deaths of otolaryngologists from COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 361 otolaryngologists were identified to have had COVID-19, and data for 325 surgeons was available for analysis. The age range was 25 to 84 years, with one-half under the age of 44 years. There were 24 deaths in the study period, with 83% over age 55 years. Source of infection was likely clinical activity in 175 (54%) cases. Prolonged exposure to a colleague was the source for 37 (11%) surgeons. Six instructional cases were identified where infections occurred during the performance of aerosol-generating operations (tracheostomy, mastoidectomy, epistaxis control, dacryocystorhinostomy, and translabyrinthine resection). In 3 of these cases, multiple operating room attendees were infected, and in 2, the surgeon succumbed to complications of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The etiology of reported cases within the otolaryngology community appear to stem equally from clinical activity and community spread. Multiple procedures performed by otolaryngologists are aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) and great care should be taken to protect the surgical team before, during, and after these operations.","Sowerby, Leigh J; Stephenson, Kate; Dickie, Alexander; Lella, Federico A Di; Jefferson, Niall; North, Hannah; De Siati, R Daniele; Maunsell, Rebecca; Herzog, Michael; Nandhan, Raghu; Trozzi, Marilena; Dehgani-Mobaraki, Puya; Melkane, Antoine; Callejas, Claudio; Miljeteig, Harald; Smit, Diane; Reynoso, Daniel Dibildox; Moura, Joao Eloi; Hermansson, Ann; Peer, Shazia; Burnell, Lisa; Fakhry, Nicolas; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos; Önerci Çelebi, Özlem; Karpischenko, Sergei; Sobol, Steven; Sargi, Zoukaa; Patel, Zara M",Int Forum Allergy Rhinol,,636
499777,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Scientific Research in the Life Sciences,2021-01-31,"AIMS: The risk of mortality from the coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 (COVID-19) is increased by comorbidity from cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Air pollution also causes excess mortality from these conditions. Analysis of the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) outcomes in 2003, and preliminary investigations of those for SARS-CoV-2 since 2019, provide evidence that the incidence and severity are related to ambient air pollution. We estimated the fraction of COVID-19 mortality that is attributable to the long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate air pollution. METHODS AND RESULTS: We characterized global exposure to fine particulates based on satellite data, and calculated the anthropogenic fraction with an atmospheric chemistry model. The degree to which air pollution influences COVID-19 mortality was derived from epidemiological data in the USA and China. We estimate that particulate air pollution contributed â¼15% (95% confidence interval 7-33%) to COVID-19 mortality worldwide, 27% (13 - 46%) in East Asia, 19% (8-41%) in Europe, and 17% (6-39%) in North America. Globally, â¼50-60% of the attributable, anthropogenic fraction is related to fossil fuel use, up to 70-80% in Europe, West Asia, and North America. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that air pollution is an important cofactor increasing the risk of mortality from COVID-19. This provides extra motivation for combining ambitious policies to reduce air pollution with measures to control the transmission of COVID-19.","Pozzer, Andrea; Dominici, Francesca; Haines, Andy; Witt, Christian; Münzel, Thomas; Lelieveld, Jos",Cardiovasc Res,,636

500473,Resident Leadership in the Era of COVID-19: Harnessing Emotional Intelligence,2020,"Mask wearing has been advocated by public health officials as a way to reduce the spread of COVID-19. In the United States, policies on mask wearing have varied from state to state over the course of the pandemic. Even as more and more states encourage or even mandate mask wearing, many citizens still resist the notion. Our research examines mask wearing policy and adherence in association with COVID-19 case rates. We used state-level data on mask wearing policy for the general public and on proportion of residents who stated they always wear masks in public. For all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), these data were abstracted by month for April â September 2020 to measure their impact on COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month (May â October 2020). Monthly COVID-19 case rates (number of cases per capita over two weeks) >200 per 100,000 residents were considered high. Fourteen of the 15 states with no mask wearing policy for the general public through September reported a high COVID-19 rate. Of the 8 states with at least 75% mask adherence, none reported a high COVID-19 rate. States with the lowest levels of mask adherence were most likely to have high COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month, independent of mask policy or demographic factors. Mean COVID-19 rates for states with at least 75% mask adherence in the preceding month was 109.26 per 100,000 compared to 249.99 per 100,000 for those with less adherence. Our analysis suggests high adherence to mask wearing could be a key factor in reducing the spread of COVID-19. This association between high mask adherence and reduced COVID-19 rates should influence policy makers and public health officials to focus on ways to improve mask adherence across the population in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.","Fischer, Charlie B; Adrien, Nedghie; Silguero, Jeremiah J; Hopper, Julianne J; Chowdhury, Abir I; Werler, Martha M",PLoS One,,636

The aim of the present study was to compare the mental health and physical activity levels between residents of Brazil and Switzerland during the social distancing period associated with COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: A self-administered questionnaire aiming to assess personal, quarantine, physical activity, and mood state disorders data was answered by 114 participants (57 from each country) of both sexes. Results: Swiss participants presented a higher frequency of people (47.4%) not abiding by social distancing measures compared to Brazilian participants (1.8%; p < 0.001, effect size = 0.56). There were no significant differences between the participants from the two countries regarding physical activity levels (p = 0.09). The Swiss presented a higher frequency (78.9%) of people without symptoms of depression compared to Brazilians (31.6%; p < 0.001, effect size = 0.48). The Swiss also presented a higher frequency (77.2%) of people without symptoms of anxiety compared to Brazilians (35.1%; p < 0.001, effect size = 0.43). There was a significant association between the restriction level and depression symptoms (p = 0.01, effect size = 0.25) but not with anxiety symptoms (p = 0.21, effect size = 0.16). Conclusions: According to the preliminary results, Brazilians presented a much higher frequency of depression and anxiety symptoms, which can be explained by characteristics other than the restriction level.","Puccinelli, Paulo J; Costa, Taline S; Seffrin, Aldo; de Lira, Claudio A B; Vancini, Rodrigo L; Knechtle, Beat; Nikolaidis, Pantelis T; Andrade, Marilia S",Medicina (Kaunas),,636

METHODS: A categorized and comprehensive search in the literature has been conducted by 10 April 2021 using international databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library in line with the PRISMA guidelines recommendations. PICO strategy was used to formulate the research question. The following terms were used: urology, COVID-19, coronavirus, BPH, inflammation, androgen receptors, LUTS, IPSS, PSA, and SARS-CoV-2 or a combination of them. Studies with irrelevant purposes and duplicates were excluded. The selected studies were performed on humans and published in English. RESULTS: The research revealed 89 articles. After title screening and considering exclusion criteria, 52 papers were included for the systematic review. BPH is a common condition affecting older men. SARS-CoV-2 infects the host cell by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A hyperactivated RAS system during infection with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to activation of pro-inflammatory pathways and increased cytokine release. Thus, this virus can lead to exacerbation of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and trigger inflammatory processes in the prostate gland. Since androgen receptors (AR) play an important role in the BPH pathophysiology and infection with SARS-CoV-2 may be androgen-mediated, BPH progression and its related symptoms can be a complication of COVID-19 through AR involvement and metabolic disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current findings, SARS-CoV-2 can possibly damage the prostate and worsen BPH and its related LUTS through ACE2 signaling, AR-related mechanisms, inflammation, and metabolic derangement. We encourage future studies to investigate the possible role of COVID-19 in the progression of BPH-related LUTS and examine the prostatic status in susceptible patients with relevant available questionnaires (e.g., IPSS) and serum biomarkers (e.g., PSA).","Haghpanah, Abdolreza; Masjedi, Fatemeh; Salehipour, Mehdi; Hosseinpour, Alireza; Roozbeh, Jamshid; Dehghani, Anahita",Prostate cancer prostatic dis,,636

The fermentation components of Streptomyces sp. 1647 exhibit potent anti-influenza A virus (IAV) activity. This strain was isolated from soil in southern China in the 1970s, but the chemical nature of its antiviral substance(s) has remained unknown until now. We used an integrated multi-omics strategy to identify the antiviral agents from this streptomycete. The antibiotics and Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell (antiSMASH) analysis of its genome sequence revealed 38 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for secondary metabolites, and the target BGCs possibly responsible for the production of antiviral components were narrowed down to three BGCs by bioactivity-guided comparative transcriptomics analysis. Through bioinformatics analysis and genetic manipulation of the regulators and a biosynthetic gene, cluster 36 was identified as the BGC responsible for the biosynthesis of the antiviral compounds. Bioactivity-based molecular networking analysis of mass spectrometric data from different recombinant strains illustrated that the antiviral compounds were a class of structural analogues. Finally, 18 pseudo-tetrapeptides with an internal ureido linkage, omicsynins A1–A6, B1–B6, and C1–C6, were identified and/or isolated from fermentation broth. Among them, 11 compounds (omicsynins A1, A2, A6, B1–B3, B5, B6, C1, C2, and C6) are new compounds. Omicsynins B1–B4 exhibited potent antiviral activity against IAV with the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of approximately 1 µmol∙L–1 and a selectivity index (SI) ranging from 100 to 300.

503510,Interpersonally-based fears during the covid-19 pandemic: Reflections on the fear of missing out and the fear of not mattering constructs,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the global COVID-19 pandemic, has severely impacted Central Asia; in spring 2020, high numbers of cases and deaths were reported in this region. The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is currently breaching the borders of Central Asia. Public health surveillance is necessary to inform policy and guide leaders; however, existing surveillance explains past transmissions while obscuring shifts in the pandemic, increases in infection rates, and the persistence of the transmission of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide enhanced surveillance metrics for SARS-CoV-2 transmission that account for weekly shifts in the pandemic, including speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence, to better understand the risk of explosive growth in each country and which countries are managing the pandemic successfully. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 60 days of COVID-19-related data from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in the Central Asia region as a function of the prior number of cases, level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: COVID-19 transmission rates were tracked for the weeks of September 30 to October 6 and October 7-13, 2020, in Central Asia. The region averaged 11,730 new cases per day for the first week and 14,514 for the second week. Infection rates increased across the region from 4.74 per 100,000 persons to 5.66. Russia and Turkey had the highest 7-day moving averages in the region, with 9836 and 1469, respectively, for the week of October 6 and 12,501 and 1603, respectively, for the week of October 13. Russia has the fourth highest speed in the region and continues to have positive acceleration, driving the negative trend for the entire region as the largest country by population. Armenia is experiencing explosive growth of COVID-19; its infection rate of 13.73 for the week of October 6 quickly jumped to 25.19, the highest in the region, the following week. The region overall is experiencing increases in its 7-day moving average of new cases, infection, rate, and speed, with continued positive acceleration and no sign of a reversal in sight. CONCLUSIONS: The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic requires novel dynamic surveillance metrics in addition to static metrics to effectively analyze the pandemic trajectory and control spread. Policy makers need to know the magnitude of transmission rates, how quickly they are accelerating, and how previous cases are impacting current caseload due to a lag effect. These metrics applied to Central Asia suggest that the region is trending negatively, primarily due to minimal restrictions in Russia.","Post, Lori Ann; Benishay, Elana T; Moss, Charles B; Murphy, Robert Leo; Achenbach, Chad J; Ison, Michael G; Resnick, Danielle; Singh, Lauren Nadya; White, Janine; Chaudhury, Azraa S; Boctor, Michael J; Welch, Sarah B; Oehmke, James Francis",J Med Internet Res,,636

In a recently published systematic review, Ivermectin is effective on several enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses such as Zika Virus, Dengue Virus, Yellow Fever Virus, West Nile Virus, Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus, Chikungunya Virus, Semliki Forest Virus, Sindbis Virus, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1. Also, SARS-CoV-2 is considered as an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that was inhibited by Ivermectin in in-vitro evaluations. Although several clinical trials about the effectiveness of Ivermectin on COVID-19 are on the way, the current in vitro research is usually used in the early stages to outline new medications. Additionally, further clinical trials are required to confirm the safety and efficacy of ivermectin for human use against COVID-19 either therapeutic or preventive.

Here we present a case of TEF secondary to post-intubation tracheomegaly in a tetanus patient. A 49-year-old male was admitted to the emergency room (ER) and diagnosed with tetanus. He became intubated and mechanically ventilated, but showed over-inflation of the endotracheal tube cuff on X-ray and chest computed tomography since the 8th day. After extubation, the patient had severe coughing during eating. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy and gastroscopy demonstrated a TEF located at the anterior wall of the esophagus. Esophageal exclusion and jejunostomy were performed to heal the fistula. The recurrent and uncontrollable muscular rigidity and spasms might be the main cause early tracheomegaly and TEF. Short-term intubation induced TEF should be aware of in specific patients.

However, there is no accreditation requirement for OH to prepare students across the professions for collaborative practice. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of faculty across the medical, veterinary, and public health programs about the need, opportunities, and challenges of developing OH in the curricula. METHODS: In this qualitative study, faculty across the three disciplines were invited to participate in audio-recorded, focus group interviews. Recordings were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: All participants recognized the need for OH as a critical concept for preparing students for collaborative practice. Opportunities were identified for shared learning and research across the disciplines, particularly through the use of interprofessional education. The lack of an accreditation mandate for OH in the medical curriculum was perceived to be the greatest challenge, leading to an anticipation of significant resistance among medical educators and students. DISCUSSION: Successful development of OH in all three curricula is vital to prepare students for current and future threats to global health. The role of accreditation bodies in ensuring medical, veterinary, and public health curricula prepare students for these threats is crucial. Implications for practice include strategies for persuading medical educators and medical students to embrace OH in the curriculum and promote a culture of shared learning.","Roopnarine, Rohini; Regan, Julie-Anne",J. contin. educ. health prof,,636

As the US population ages, the number of older adults with cancer is projected to dramatically increase. Despite this, older adults remain vastly underrepresented in research that sets the standards for cancer treatments and, consequently, clinicians struggle with how to interpret data from clinical trials and apply them to older adults in practice. A combination of system, clinician, and patient barriers bar opportunities for trial participation for many older patients, and strategies are needed to address these barriers at multiple fronts, five of which are offered here. This review highlights the need to (1) broaden eligibility criteria, (2) measure relevant end points, (3) expand standard trial designs, (4) increase resources (e.g., institutional support, interdisciplinary care, and telehealth), and (5) develop targeted interventions (e.g., behavioral interventions to promote patient enrollment). Implementing these solutions requires a substantial investment in engaging and collaborating with community-based practices, where the majority of older patients with cancer receive their care. Multifaceted strategies are needed to ensure that older patients with cancer, across diverse healthcare settings, receive the highest-quality, evidence-based care.","Liu, Jennifer; Gutierrez, Eutiquio; Tiwari, Abhay; Padam, Simran; Li, Daneng; Dale, William; Pal, Sumanta K.; Stewart, Daphne; Subbiah, Shanmugga; Bosserman, Linda D.; Presant, Cary; Phillips, Tanyanika; Yap, Kelly; Hill, Addie; Bhatt, Geetika; Yeon, Christina; Cianfrocca, Mary; Yuan, Yuan; Mortimer, Joanne; Sedrak, Mina S.",J.

Methods: A total of 1,115 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled at Tongji hospital from February to April 2020 and classified into fatal (n = 129) and recovered (n = 986) groups according to the patient's outcome. Prealbumin and other routine laboratory indicators were measured simultaneously. Results: The level of prealbumin on admission was significantly lower in fatal patients than in recovered patients. For predicting the prognosis of COVID-19, the performance of prealbumin was better than most routine laboratory indicators, such as albumin, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, hypersensitive C-reactive protein, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, and hypersensitive cardiac troponin I. When a threshold of 126 mg/L was used to discriminate between fatal and recovered patients, the sensitivity and specificity of prealbumin were, respectively, 78.29 and 90.06%. Furthermore, a model based on the combination of nine indexes showed an improved performance in predicting the death of patients with COVID-19. Using a cut-off value of 0.19, the prediction model was able to distinguish between fatal and recovered individuals with a sensitivity of 86.82% and a specificity of 90.37%. Conclusions: A lower level of prealbumin on admission may indicate a worse outcome of COVID-19. Immune and nutritional status may be vital factors for predicting disease progression in the early stage of COVID-19.","Luo, Ying; Xue, Ying; Mao, Liyan; Yuan, Xu; Lin, Qun; Tang, Guoxing; Song, Huijuan; Wang, Feng; Sun, Ziyong",Front.

508860,Oligonucleotides and the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Perspective,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the outcomes of tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Tracheostomy has an essential role in managing COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure who require prolonged mechanical ventilation. However, limited data are available on how tracheostomy affects COVID19 outcomes, and uncertainty surrounding risk of infectious transmission has led to divergent recommendations and practices. METHODS: It is a multicenter, retrospective study; data were collected on all tracheostomies performed in COVID-19 patients at seven hospitals in five tertiary academic medical systems through September 2020. RESULTS: Tracheotomy was performed in 118 patients with median time from intubation to tracheostomy of 22âdays (Q1-Q3: 18-25). All tracheostomies were performed employing measures to minimize aerosol generation, 78.0% by percutaneous technique, and 95.8% at bedside in negative pressure rooms. Seventy-eight (66.1%) patients were weaned from the ventilator and 18 (15.3%) patients died from causes unrelated to tracheostomy. No major procedural complications occurred. Early tracheostomy (&#8804;14âdays) was associated with decreased ventilator days; median ventilator days [Q1-Q3] among patients weaned from the ventilator in the early, middle and late groups were 21 [21-31], 34 [26.5-42] and 37 [32-41] days, respectively with p = 0.030. Compared to surgical tracheostomy, percutaneous technique was associated with faster weaning for patients weaned off the ventilator (median [Q1-Q3]: 34 [29-39] vs. 39 [34-51] days, p = 0.038); decreased ventilator-associated pneumonia (58.7% vs. 80.8%, p = 0.039); and among patients who were discharged, shorter intensive care unit duration (median [Q1-Q3]: 33 [27-42] vs. 47 [33-64] days, p = 0.009); and shorter hospital length of stay (median [Q1-Q3]: 46 [33-59] vs. 59.5 [48-80] days, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Early, percutaneous tracheostomy was associated with improved outcomes compared to surgical tracheostomy in a multi-institutional series of ventilated patients with COVID-19.","Mahmood, Kamran; Cheng, George Z; Van Nostrand, Keriann; Shojaee, Samira; Wayne, Max T; Abbott, Matthew; Nettlow, Darrell; Parish, Alice; Green, Cynthia L; Safi, Javeryah; Brenner, Michael J; De Cardenas, Jose",Ann. surg,,636

509918,A novel cellular automata classifier for COVID-19 prediction,2020,"To investigate the feasibility of lung ultrasound in evaluating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and distinguish the sonographic features between COVID-19 and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), a total of 12 COVID-19 patients and 20 CAP patients were selected and underwent lung ultrasound. The modified Buda scoring system for interstitial lung disease was used to evaluate the severity and treatment effect of COVID-19 on ultrasonography. The differences between modified lung ultrasound (MLUS) score and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) Warrick score were analyzed to evaluate their correlation. COVID-19 showed the following sonographic features: thickening (12/12), blurred (9/12), discontinuous (6/12) pleural line; rocket sign (4/12), partially diffused B-line (12/12), completely diffused B-line (10/12), waterfall sign (4/12); C-line sign (5/12); pleural effusion (1/12) and pulmonary balloon (Am line, 1/12). The last two features were rarely seen. Differences of ultrasonic features, including lesion range, lung signs and pneumonia-related complications, between COVID-19 and CAP were statistically significant (pË 0.05 or 0.001). MLUS scores (pâ¯=â¯0.006) and HRCT Warrick scores (pâ¯=â¯0.015) increased as the severity of COVID-19 increased. The differences between moderate (29.00 [25.75-37.50]) and severe (43.00 [38.75-47.25]) (pâ¯=â¯0.022) or between moderate and critical (47.50 [44.25-50.00]) (pâ¯=â¯0.002) type COVID-19 were statistically significant, compared with those between severe and critical types. Correlation between MLUS scores and HRCT Warrick scores was positive (râ¯=â¯0.54, pâ¯=â¯0.048). MLUS scores (Zâ¯=â¯2.61, pâ¯=â¯0.009) and HRCT Warrick scores (Zâ¯=â¯2.63, pâ¯=â¯0.009) of five severe or critical COVID-19 patients significantly decreased as their conditions improved after treatment. The differences of sonographic features between COVID-19 and CAP patients were notable.

510089,U.S. Political Partisanship and COVID-19: Risk Information Seeking and Prevention Behaviors,2021,"Although mechanical ventilation is a lifesaving intervention in the ICU, it has harmful side-effects, such as barotrauma and volutrauma. These harms can occur due to asynchronies. Asynchronies are defined as a mismatch between the ventilator timing and patient respiratory effort. Automatic detection of these asynchronies, and subsequent feedback, would improve lung ventilation and reduce the probability of lung damage. Neural networks to detect asynchronies provide a promising new approach but require large annotated data sets, which are difficult to obtain and require complex monitoring of inspiratory effort. In this work, we propose a model-based approach to generate a synthetic data set for machine learning and educational use by extending an existing lung model with a first-order ventilator model. The physiological nature of the derived lung model allows adaptation to various disease archetypes, resulting in a diverse data set. We generated a synthetic data set using 9 different patient archetypes, which are derived from measurements in the literature. The model and synthetic data quality have been verified by comparison with clinical data, review by a clinical expert, and an artificial intelligence model that was trained on experimental data. The evaluation showed it was possible to generate patient-ventilator waveforms including asynchronies that have the most important features of experimental patient-ventilator waveforms.","Diepen, A. van; Bakkes, T.

These communities have long faced barriers to health care access, challenges due to immigration status, and financial and labor instability. The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated these existing issues in a vulnerable, often forgotten, immigrant community. It is challenging for this population to access public information regarding COVID-19 testing, treatment, and assistance programs because this information is seldom disseminated in Spanish and even less frequently in Portuguese. While long-term solutions will require time and changes to policy, some short-term measures can mitigate the current situation. The authors share their experience from Newark, New Jersey, where partnerships of public and private community-based organizations (CBOs) have been successful in establishing trust between the health care system and a fearful Latino community. The Ironbound Initiative, a student group at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School in Newark, New Jersey, has partnered with Mantena Global Care, a Brazilian CBO in Newark, to facilitate dissemination of COVID-19-relevant information. Medical student volunteers, removed from their clinical duties, serve as virtual patient navigators, using social media to reach community members with the goals of improving awareness of precautions to take during the pandemic and of increasing access to needed medical care. These students have collaborated with colleagues in other disciplines to provide necessary legal guidance to community members fearful of seeking care because of their immigration status. The authors urge other academic institutions across the country to recruit multidisciplinary teams of medical, health professional, and law students invested in their local communities and to empower students to partner with CBOs, immigrant community leaders, faith-based organizations, hospitals, and local authorities to support these vulnerable communities during this crisis.","Behbahani, Sara; Smith, Cynthia A; Carvalho, Michelly; Warren, Christopher J; Gregory, Micah; Silva, Nicole A",Acad. med,,636

Due to the unavailability of any proven treatment or vaccination, the outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide. Hence, there is an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. Since, botanicals are an important resource for several efficacious antiviral agents, natural compounds gaining significant attention for COVID-19 treatment. In the present study, methyltranferase (MTase) of the SARS-CoV-2 is targeted using computational approach. The compounds were identified using molecular docking, virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulation studies. The binding mechanism of each compound was analyzed considering the stability and energetic parameter using in silico methods. We have found four natural antiviral compounds Amentoflavone, Baicalin, Daidzin and Luteoloside as strong inhibitors of methyltranferase of SARS-CoV-2. ADMET prediction and target analysis of the selected compounds showed favorable results. MD simulation was performed for four top-scored molecules to analyze the stability, binding mechanism and energy requirements. MD simulation studies indicated energetically favorable complex formation between MTase and the selected antiviral compounds. Furthermore, the structural effects on these substitutions were analyzed using the principles of each trajectories, which validated the interaction studies. Our analysis suggests that there is a very high probability that these compounds may have a good potential to inhibit Methyltransferase (MTase) of SARS-CoV-2 and to be used in the treatment of COVID-19. Further studies on these natural compounds may offer a quick therapeutic choice to treat COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

To explore and assess the effective strategies for curtailing the epidemic risk from international importation nationwide, we evaluated ""the joint prevention and control"" mechanism, which made up of 19 containment policies, on how it impacted the change of medical observation and detection time from border arrival to laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 in its burst in China. Based on 1,314 epidemiological-survey cases from February 29 to May 25, 2020, we found that the synchronized approach of implementing multi-dimensional interventional policies, such as a centralized quarantine and nucleic acid testing (NAT), flight service adjustment and border closure, effectively facilitate early identification of infected case. Specifically, the implementation of the international flight service reduction was found to be associated with a reduction of the mean intervals of diagnosis from arrival to lab-confirmation by 0.44 days maximally, and the border closure was associated with a reduction of the diagnosis interval of imported cases by 0.69 days, from arrival to laboratory confirmation. The study suggests that a timely and synchronized implementation of multi-dimensional policies is compelling in preventing domestic spreading from importation.","Chen, Zhenhua; Yu, Meng; Wang, Yuxuan; Zhou, Lei",PLoS One,,636

Therefore, a triumph in the battle against COVID-19 could only be achieved if a health care system's capacity to support a potentially overwhelming increase in critical patient care needs is maintained, and the viral curve is flattened. Accordingly, health care bodies around the globe called upon prioritising appropriate resource allocation as it relates to elective invasive procedures and minimising the use of essential items required to care for patients. The unpredictability COVID-19 timeline in the absence of effective drug treatments and vaccination along with the restrictive health care policies implemented suggest that patients may be deprived of access to needed surgical care, likely for many months. However, the potential undue delay in delivering essential elective surgical care may have a more detrimental impact on patients' health compared to that of COVID-19 itself. This particularly applies to the paediatric population in which infection rates have been demonstrated to be considerably lower and mortalities have not been reported yet. Therefore, the need emerges for actions to be taken that allow for the resumption of essential elective surgical procedures in this population of patients. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive search through surgical guidance and recommendations to develop a set of evidence based recommendations that allow for the safe and timely delivery of essential paediatric surgical care during the time of COVID-19. Conclusion: No compelling evidence that the paediatric population is at an increased risk of morbidity or mortality exists. Therefore, delaying essential paediatric surgical care cannot be justified as it may have a potentially negative health impact, and continuous refinements of surgical recommendations are encouraged in view of evolving circumstances.","Al-Omar, Khaled; Bakkar, Sohail",Afr J Paediatr Surg,,636

METHOD: The article makes general observations about the themes emerging in the special issue with considerations for application, training, theory-driven research, and policy. It then presents as a case example the rapid deployment during the pandemic of telepsychology doctoral training and services at the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Primary Care Psychology Collaborative. RESULTS: Facilitators to VCU telepsychology deployment included trainee and supervisor resources, strong telepsychology training, and prior experience. Barriers to overcome included limited clinic capacity, scheduling, technology, and accessibility and diversity issues. Lessons learned involved presenting clinical issues, supervision, and working with children and adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Telepsychology is crucial for psychological service provision, during the COVID-19 pandemic more than ever, and that is unlikely to change as psychologists and patients increasingly continue to appreciate its value.","Perrin, Paul B; Rybarczyk, Bruce D; Pierce, Bradford S; Jones, Heather A; Shaffer, Carla; Islam, Leila",J Clin Psychol,,636

514760,COVID-19 pandemic and the global perspective of turkish thoracic society,2020,"Purpose: The COVID-19 crisis has caused major supply chain disruptions, and these can be traced back to basic supply chain risks that have previously been well identified in literature. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a pathway for closing the gap between supply chain resilience research and efforts in industry to develop a more resilient supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: Based upon virtual roundtables with supply chain executives, supplemented with interviews and publicly available datapoints about COVID-19 impact on the supply chain, we explore challenges in industry and suggest opportunity areas where research can support efforts in industry to improve supply chain resilience. Findings: During the COVID-19 crisis, participating supply chain executives are experiencing textbook supply, demand and control risks in the supply chain. They also observe a lack of preparedness, shortcomings of current response plans and the need for greater supply chain resilience. Focus areas in improving resilience mirror generic recommendations from literature and provide a rich opportunity to reduce the gap between research findings and efforts in industry. Research limitations/implications: More empirical, event-based and less conceptual research into supply chain resilience has been called for several times during the last two decades. COVID-19 provides a very rich opportunity for researchers to conduct the type of research that has been called for. This research may contribute to the structurally de-risking of supply chains. Areas of research opportunity include decision models for supply chain design that avoid overfocusing on costs only, and that consider the value of flexibility, short response times and multiple sources as well as methods for enriching supplier segmentation and evaluation models to reduce a focus on savings and payment terms only. Practical implications: Key levers for de-risking the supply chain include the need to balance global sourcing with nearshore and local sourcing, the adoption of multiple sources and a greater utilization of information technology to drive more complete and immediate information availability. Perhaps most importantly, talent management in supply chain management needs to promote a focus not just on costs, but also on resilience as well as on learning from current events to improve decision-making. Social implications: There is a great opportunity for supply chain managers to grow their contribution to society beyond risk response into the proactive reduction of risks for the future. Researchers can serve society by informing this progress with impactful research. Originality/value: This article offers initial empirical exploration of supply chain risks experienced in the context of COVID-19 and approaches considered in industry to improve supply chain resilience. Opportunities for empirical, event-based and less conceptual research that has been called for years, are identified. This research can help close the gap between supply chain resilience research and efforts in industry to improve supply chain resilience. Hopefully the research opportunities identified can inspire the flurry of research that can be expected in response to the multiple special issues planned by journals in our field.","Remko, van Hoek",Int.

The virus was first found in the Wuhan seafood market at the end of 2019, with a controversial source. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and respiratory tract inflammation, with some severe patients developing an acute and chronic lung injury, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis (PF). It has already claimed approximately 300 thousand human lives and the number is still on the rise; the only way to prevent the infection is to be safe till vaccines and reliable treatments develop. In previous studies, the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in clinical trials had been proven to be effective in immune modulation and tissue repair promotion; however, their efficacy in treating COVID-19 remains underestimated. Here, we report the findings from past experiences of SARS and MSCs, and how SARS could also induce PF. Such studies may help to understand the rationale for the recent cell-based therapies for COVID-19.","Chuang, Hong-Meng; Ho, Li-Ing; Harn, Horng-Jyh; Liu, Ching-Ann",Cell Transplant,,636

Our analysis proves that the final case fatality ratio for several major European countries is bound to largely exceed 10%.

We thus evaluate the effectiveness of the surgical mask, the N95 respirator mask, and its equivalent (KF94 mask) in filtering SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Patients hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 infection were instructed to cough five times each while wearing (1) no mask, (2) surgical mask, (3) KF94 mask, and (4) N95 mask. The coughs were separated by 20-second intervals, and the patients were rested for at least 5 min between each setting. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in patient samples (i.e. nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva), petri dishes placed in front of the patients during coughing, and swabs from the outer and inner surfaces of the masks were analysed with PCR. RESULTS: A total of 7 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection participated in the mask test. SARS-CoV-2 was detected on the petri dishes after coughing in 3 out of 7 cases with the surgical mask or no mask. Viral particles were not found in the petri dishes after coughing while wearing the N95 mask or the KF94 mask. While viral particles were detected in both the inner and outer surfaces of the surgical masks, those were detected only in the inner surfaces of the N95 and K94 masks. CONCLUSION: Surgical masks were less effective in filtering viral particles from coughing patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. N95 masks and its equivalents efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 particles from coughing patients.","Kim, Min-Chul; Bae, Seongman; Kim, Ji Yeun; Park, Se Yoon; Lim, Joon Seo; Sung, Minki; Kim, Sung-Han",Infect Dis (Lond),,636

However, no rationale for how to prioritize service shut down and patient care exists. A consensus-based ad-hoc expert panel of allergy/immunology specialists from the United States and Canada developed a service and patient prioritization schematic to temporarily triage allergy/immunology services. Recommendations and feedback were developed iteratively, using an adapted modified Delphi methodology to achieve consensus. During the ongoing pandemic while social distancing is being encouraged, most allergy/immunology care could be postponed/delayed or handled through virtual care. With the exception of many patients with primary immunodeficiency, patients on venom immunotherapy, and patients with asthma of a certain severity, there is limited need for face-to-face visits under such conditions. These suggestions are intended to help provide a logical approach to quickly adjust service to mitigate risk to both medical staff and patients. Importantly, individual community circumstances may be unique and require contextual consideration. The decision to enact any of these measures rests with the judgment of each clinician and individual health care system. Pandemics are unanticipated, and enforced social distancing/quarantining is highly unusual. This expert panel consensus document offers a prioritization rational to help guide decision making when such situations arise and an allergist/immunologist is forced to reduce services or makes the decision on his or her own to do so.","Shaker, Marcus S; Oppenheimer, John; Grayson, Mitchell; Stukus, David; Hartog, Nicholas; Hsieh, Elena W Y; Rider, Nicholas; Dutmer, Cullen M; Vander Leek, Timothy K; Kim, Harold; Chan, Edmond S; Mack, Doug; Ellis, Anne K; Lang, David; Lieberman, Jay; Fleischer, David; Golden, David B K; Wallace, Dana; Portnoy, Jay; Mosnaim, Giselle; Greenhawt, Matthew",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,,636
516725,"A Pandemic of Mistreatment: Theories, Practices, and Convergences in Womanist Clinical Pastoral Theology and Black Maternal Healthcare During Covid-19",2021,"Strategic and tactical capacity planning are critical decisions faced by hospitals. While these problems have received significant attention, current queueing-based approaches do not address realistic healthcare constraints such as blocking, transient arrivals, transient capacity assignments, and surge capacities. A queueing methodology is developed to extend the analysis of these constructs. The methodology developed is generic for hospitals responding to demand surges during epidemics and pandemics such as the recent COVID-19, and in other application areas in manufacturing, supply chain management, and logistics. The medical staff and patient chairs in the emergency room, beds in the operating theater, ICU, and medical/surgical care units are used in patient treatment at a hospital. They can be considered as servers in a system, where capacity and operational policies affect performance measures such as patient throughput. The methodology develops the probabilities from which system performance measures can be estimated for a serial queueing network with blocking. Transient analysis is employed, due to the time varying nature of the patient arrival patterns. The methodology has the capability to analyze different interventions such as increasing and decreasing capacities, and ambulance diversion. In order to handle typical hospital sized problems that result in thousands of ordinary differential equations defining the system probabilities, a transient version of Kanban queueing network decomposition is developed along with procedures for dealing with the discontinuities that arise at capacity changes. Verification/validation is presented along with several scenarios that illustrate the potential application of this methodology in emergency hospital management.","Curry, G.

The objective of this study is to study the change in the volume and spectrum of surgeries performed during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-COVID-19 era. METHODS: Details of all patients who were operated under department of neurosurgery at our institute since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic in India were collected and compared to the same time period last year. The demographic profile, diagnosis, surgery performed, type of surgery (routine/emergency, cranial/spinal and major/minor) in these two groups were compared. They were further categorized into various categories [neuro-oncology (brain and spine tumors), neuro-trauma (head injury and spinal trauma), congenital cases, degenerative spine, neuro-vascular, CSF diversion procedures, etc.] and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Our study showed a drastic fall (52.2%) in the number of surgeries performed during the pandemic compared to pre-COVID era. 11.3% of patients operated during COVID-19 pandemic were non-emergent surgeries compared to 57.7% earlier (p = 0.000). There was increase in proportion of minor cases from 28.8% to 41.5% (p = 0.106). The proportion of spinal cases decreased from 27.9% to 11.3% during the COVID-19 pandemic (p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: The drastic decrease in the number of surgeries performed will result in large backlog of patients waiting for 'elective' surgery. There is a risk of these patients presenting at a later stage with progressed disease and the best way forward would be to resume work with necessary precautions and universal effective COVID-19 testing.","Goyal, Nishant; Venkataram, Tejas; Singh, Vineet; Chaturvedi, Jitender",J Clin Neurosci,,636

(Special edition for COVID-19.),2020,"Euclidean Markov decision processes are a powerful tool for modeling control problems under uncertainty over continuous domains. Finite state imprecise, Markov decision processes can be used to approximate the behavior of these infinite models. In this paper we address two questions: first, we investigate what kind of approximation guarantees are obtained when the Euclidean process is approximated by finite state approximations induced by increasingly fine partitions of the continuous state space. We show that for cost functions over finite time horizons the approximations become arbitrarily precise. Second, we use imprecise Markov decision process approximations as a tool to analyse and validate cost functions and strategies obtained by reinforcement learning. We find that, on the one hand, our new theoretical results validate basic design choices of a previously proposed reinforcement learning approach. On the other hand, the imprecise Markov decision process approximations reveal some inaccuracies in the learned cost functions.","Jaeger, Manfred; Bacci, Giorgio; Bacci, Giovanni; Larsen, Kim Guldstrand; Jensen, Peter Gjol",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14923v1.pdf,636

Many future teachers learn mathematics content primarily through mathematics major courses that are taught by mathematicians who do not specialize in teacher preparation. How can mathematics education researchers assist mathematicians in making explicit connections between the content of undergraduate mathematics courses and the content of secondary mathematics? We present an articulation of five types of connections that can be used in secondary mathematics teacher preparation and give examples of question prompts that mathematicians can use as applications of teaching secondary mathematics in undergraduate mathematics courses.,"Arnold, Elizabeth G.; Burroughs, Elizabeth A.; Fulton, Elizabeth W.; 'Alvarez, James A.

The ability to detect disease outbreaks in the early stages is a key component of efficient disease control and prevention. With the increased availability of electronic health-care data and spatial analysis techniques, there is great potential to develop algorithms to enable more effective disease surveillance. The research focuses to develop a transparent user-friendly method to simulate the outbreak data. The paper describes the GIS tools to identify and define the field of investigation which requires consideration of the strengths and limitations of data collection instruments, facility of locational data collection, accuracy of locational data, and pertinent attributes for understanding disease risk. Using such information, it is quite easy for authorities to locate the highly effected area and take appropriate actions in that particular areas.

COVID-19 was first reported in China and rigorous researches are going on for developing vaccine for the pandemic. This review was prepared by following PRISMA guidelines and used the resources from the Web of Science and PubMed. This research focuses on the niches of symptoms and vaccines for COVID-19. The research for vaccine involves research for new vaccine and drug repurposing. Out of various drug repurposing options, Remdesivir, and Favipiravir, Chloroquine and Lopinavir/Ritonavir were found to be the popular ones for treating COVID-19 patients across the world. Even though there are concerns regarding asymptotic patients, the most dominant symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and cough, followed by Dyspnoea and muscle ache. This review concludes that the COVID-19 related research should focus on developing immunity vaccines, and repurposing of drugs. Research on the problems of quarantine life, patient monitoring, and usage of information technology in facing COVID-19 will improve the quality of patient handling during the pandemic. The research on the effectiveness of various models of lockdown and regulation of social life during lockdown periods, improving the safety of health care workers in the workplace will definitely help the governments in their fight against COVID-19.","Singh, Sanjeet; Jayaram, R.",J.

It was first reported on in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China and within three months spread as a pandemic around the whole globe. Here, we study macro-epidemiological patterns along the time course of the COVID-19 pandemic. We compute the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths for countries worldwide and for counties in the US and show that both distributions follow a truncated power-law over five orders of magnitude. We are able to explain the origin of this scaling behavior as a dual-scale process: the large-scale spread of the virus between countries and the small-scale accumulation of case numbers within each country. Assuming exponential growth on both scales, the critical exponent of the power-law is determined by the ratio of large-scale to small-scale growth rates. We confirm this theory in numerical simulations in a simple meta-population model, describing the epidemic spread in a network of interconnected countries. Our theory gives a mechanistic explanation why most COVID-19 cases occurred within a few epicenters, at least in the initial phase of the outbreak. By combining real world data, modeling, and numerical simulations, we make the case that the distribution of epidemic prevalence might follow universal rules.","Blasius, Bernd",Chaos,,636

521274,"What lessons can Africa learn from the social determinants of COVID-19 spread, to better prepare for the current and future pandemics in the continent?",2021,"Genomics has become an essential technology for surveilling emerging infectious disease outbreaks. A wide range of technologies and strategies for pathogen genome enrichment and sequencing are being used by laboratories worldwide, together with different, and sometimes ad hoc, analytical procedures for generating genome sequences. As a result, public repositories now contain non-standard entries of varying quality. A standardized analytical process for consensus genome sequence determination, particularly for outbreaks such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is critical to provide a solid genomic basis for epidemiological analyses and well-informed decision making. To address this need, we have developed a bioinformatic workflow to standardize the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data generated with either the Illumina or Oxford Nanopore platforms. Using an intuitive web-based interface, this workflow automates SARS-CoV-2 reference-based genome assembly, variant calling, lineage determination, and provides the ability to submit the consensus sequence and necessary metadata to GenBank or GISAID. Given a raw Illumina or Oxford Nanopore FASTQ read file, this web-based platform enables non-bioinformatics experts to automatically produce a SARS-CoV-2 genome that is ready for submission to GISAID or GenBank.

Here, we report the identification of a novel bovine group A rotavirus from diarrhea of adult cows. A group A rotavirus was detected from an epizootic outbreak of diarrhea in adult cows with a decrease in milk production in Japan in 2013. The comprehensive genomic analyses from fecal samples by viral metagenomics using a next-generation sequencer revealed that it had an unreported genotype combination G15P[14]. The genome constellation of this strain, namely, RVA/Cow-wt/JPN/Tottori-SG/2013/G15P[14] was G15-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3 representing VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5, respectively. Each gene segment of Tottori-SG was most closely related to Japanese bovine group A rotaviruses suggesting that Tottori-SG might have derived from multiple reassortment events from group A rotavirus strains circulating among Japanese cattle.

Mobile health (mHealth) apps are commonly used by people with MS to help manage their health. However, there are limited health apps for people with MS designed to evaluate fall risk. A fall risk app can increase access to fall risk assessments and improve self-management. When designing mHealth apps, a user-centered approach is critical for improving use and adoption. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to undergo a user-centered approach to test and refine the usability of the app through an iterative design process. METHODS: The fall risk app Steady-MS is an extension of Steady, a fall risk app for older adults. Steady-MS consists of 2 components: a 25-item questionnaire about demographics and MS symptoms and 5 standing balance tasks. Data from the questionnaire and balance tasks were inputted into an algorithm to compute a fall risk score. Two iterations of semistructured interviews (n=5 participants per iteration) were performed to evaluate usability. People with MS used Steady-MS on a smartphone, thinking out loud. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and developed into codes and themes. People with MS also completed the System Usability Scale. RESULTS: A total of 3 themes were identified: intuitive navigation, efficiency of use, and perceived value. Overall, the participants found Steady-MS efficient to use and useful to learn their fall risk score. There were challenges related to cognitive overload during the balance tasks. Modifications were made, and after the second iteration, people with MS reported that the app was intuitive and efficient. Average System Usability Scale scores were 95.5 in both iterations, representing excellent usability. CONCLUSIONS: Steady-MS is the first mHealth app for people with MS to assess their overall risk of falling and is usable by a subset of people with MS. People with MS found Steady-MS to be usable and useful for understanding their risk of falling. When developing future mHealth apps for people with MS, it is important to prevent cognitive overload through simple and clear instructions and present scores that are understood and interpreted correctly through visuals and text. These findings underscore the importance of user-centered design and provide a foundation for the future development of tools to assess and prevent scalable falls for people with MS. Future steps include understanding the validity of the fall risk algorithm and evaluating the clinical utility of the app.","Hsieh, Katherine; Fanning, Jason; Frechette, Mikaela; Sosnoff, Jacob",JMIR Hum Factors,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33749609/; https://doi.org/10.2196/25604,636
591580,The Consequences of COVID-19 Toward Human Growth: The Role of Traumatic Event and Coping Strategies Among Indonesian Sample,2021-08-18,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with poorer adult mental health, and benevolent childhood experiences (BCEs) are associated with better adult mental health. This study aims to test whether ACEs and BCEs predict adult mental health above and beyond current stress and social support during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed data from undergraduate and graduate students (N = 502) at an urban private university in the Western United States. An online survey was conducted to assess ACEs and BCEs, current stress and social support, depressive and anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, and loneliness in May 2020. Higher levels of ACEs were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, β = 0.45, p = 0.002. Higher levels of BCEs were associated with lower depressive symptoms, β = −0.39, p = 0.03; lower perceived stress, β = −0.26, p = 0.002; and less loneliness, β = −0.12, p = 0.04. These associations held while controlling for current stress, social support, and socioeconomic status. Childhood experiences are associated with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. BCEs should be considered an important promotive factor, independent of ACEs, for psychological well-being during a global public health crisis. BCEs should be included along with ACEs in future research, assessment, and screening with distressed and vulnerable populations.","Doom, Jenalee R.; Seok, Deborah; Narayan, Angela J.; Fox, Kathryn R.",Advers Resil Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42844-021-00038-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33907733/,636

Children seemed to be infected less frequently than adults, and family clusters seemed to play an important role in the spread of the pandemic. The aim of this study is to evaluate the serological profile of children and young adults between 4 and 16 years of age in order to assess the transmission patterns of COVID-19 between cohabitants. The subjects lived with at least one cohabitant who tested positive for the disease using a nasopharyngeal swab. To avoid contact with the disease, families were interviewed by telephone. Forty-nine children and adolescents with a mean age of 11 years were then subjected to a rapid lateral flow chromatographic test. Of them, seven (14.3%) were immunoglobulin G (IgG)-positive, and four (8.2%) were immunoglobulin M (IgM)-positive. In total, 16.3% of the tested sample had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2: this may confirm the lower vulnerability of children to COVID-19, despite the small sample size. The time from the negativization of the cohabitant until the test day may have influenced the results, especially when this timeframe is wide.","Farronato, Marco; Dolci, Carolina; Boccalari, Elisa; Izadi, Sara; Salvatierra Rios, Luis Hernan; Festa, Maurizio; Panetta, Valentina; De Vito, Danila; Tartaglia, Gianluca Martino",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33557402/,636
592055,Comparing coal phase-out pathways: The United Kingdom’s and Germany’s diverging transitions,2020-10-01,"We have previously demonstrated that antigens chemically coupled to the surface of liposomes consisting of unsaturated fatty acids were cross-presented by antigen presenting cells to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Liposomal form of immunodominant CTL epitope peptides derived from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus exhibited highly efficient antiviral CTL responses in immunized mice. In this study, we coupled 15 highly conserved immunodominant CTL epitope peptides derived from hepatitis C virus (HCV) to the surface of liposomes. We also emulsified the peptides in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant, and compared the immune responses of the two methods of presenting the peptides by cytotoxicity induction and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production by CD8(+) T cells of the immunized mice. We noticed significant variations of the immunogenicity of each peptide between the two antigen delivery systems. In addition, the immunogenicity profiles of the peptides were also different from those observed in the mice infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing HCV proteins as previously reported. Induction of anti-viral immunity by liposomal peptides was tested by the challenge experiments using recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing corresponding HCV epitopes. One D(b)-restricted and three HLA-A(*)0201-restricted HCV CTL epitope peptides on the surface of liposomes were found to confer complete protection to immunized mice with establishment of long-term memory. Interestingly, their protective efficacy seemed to correlate with the induction of IFN-γ producing cells rather than the cytotoxicity induction suggesting that the immunized mice were protected through non-cytolytic mechanisms. Thus, these liposomal peptides might be useful as HCV vaccines not only for prevention but also for therapeutic use.","Takagi, Akira; Kobayashi, Nobuharu; Taneichi, Maiko; Uchida, Tetsuya; Akatsuka, Toshitaka",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X12021894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23159619/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X12021894; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.028,636
592227,Transformation to Virtual Training during COVID-19 Pandemic: Case Report from a Low Resources' Country,2020-12-10,"Recent advances in xenotransplantation have produced organs from pigs that are well tolerated in primate models because of genetic changes engineered to delete major antigens from donor animals. To ensure the safety of human transplant recipients, it will be essential to understand both the spectrum of infectious agents in donor pigs and their potential to be transmitted to immunocompromised transplant recipients. Equally important will be the development of new highly sensitive diagnostic methods for use in the detection of these agents in donor animals and for the monitoring of transplant recipients. Herein, we report results from a panel of 30 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays for infectious agents with the potential to be transmitted to the human host. The reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity of each assay were evaluated and were found to exhibit analytic sensitivity that was similar to that of quantitative assays used to perform viral load testing of human viruses in clinical laboratories. This analytical approach was used to detect nucleic acids of infectious agents present in specimens from 9 sows and 22 piglets derived by caesarean section. The most commonly detected targets in adult animals were Mycoplasma species and two distinct herpesviruses, porcine lymphotrophic herpesvirus 2 and 3. A total of 14 piglets were derived from three sows infected with either or both herpesviruses, yet none tested positive for the viruses indicating that vertical transmission of these viruses is inefficient.","Hartline, Caroll B.; Conner, Ra’Shun L.; James, Scott H.; Potter, Jennifer; Gray, Edward; Estrada, Jose; Tector, Mathew; Tector, A.

593982,Uses and Perceptions of Music in Times of COVID-19: A Spanish Population Survey,2021-01-12,"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic spread rapidly worldwide increasing exponentially in Italy. To date, there is lack of studies describing clinical characteristics of the population most at risk of infection. Hence, we aimed to identify clinical predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and to develop and validate a score predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection risk comparing it with unspecific surrogates. MethodsRetrospective case/control study using administrative health-related database was carried out in Southern Italy (Campania region) among beneficiaries of Regional Health Service aged over than 30 years. For each subject with Covid-19 confirmed diagnosis (case), up to five controls were randomly matched for gender, age and municipality of residence. Odds ratios and 90% confidence intervals for associations between candidate predictors and risk of infection were estimated by means of conditional logistic regression. SARS-CoV-2 Infection Score (SIS), was developed by generating a total aggregate score obtained from assignment of a weight at each selected covariate using coefficients estimated from the model. Finally, the score was categorized by assigning increasing values from 1 to 4. SIS was validated by comparison with specific and unspecific predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ResultsSubjects suffering from diabetes, anaemias, Parkinsons disease, mental disorders, cardiovascular and inflammatory bowel and kidney diseases showed increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similar estimates were recorded for men and women and younger and older than 65 years. Fifteen conditions significantly contributed to the SIS. As SIS value increases, risk progressively increases, being odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people with the highest SIS value (SIS=4), 1.74 times higher than those unaffected by any SIS contributing conditions (SIS=1). ConclusionThis study identified conditions and diseases making individuals more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results are a decision-maker support tool for identifying population most at risk allowing adoption of preventive measures to minimize a potential new relapse damage.","Orlando, Valentina; Rea, Federico; savarÃ¨, Laura; Guarino, Ilaria; Mucherino, Sara; Perrella, Alessandro; Trama, Ugo; Coscioni, Enrico; Menditto, Enrica; Corrao, Giovanni",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.23.217331,636
594328,Setting the Stage for Reimbursable Pediatric Healthy Weight Programs,2021,"Background The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic necessitated a rapid transition from in-person evaluations to remote delivery of care, including both video and telephone visits, in allergy/immunology practices. Objective To evaluate patient satisfaction, patient and physician impression of encounter completeness, and reimbursement between in-person, video, and telephone encounters. This study also assessed factors influencing patient satisfaction, perception of completeness, and choice of future evaluation type. Methods This was a prospective study of all encounters at a healthcare-system owned practice. Encounter type, encounter modality, patient demographics, primary diagnoses, reimbursement data, and physician assessment of encounter completeness were tracked. Patient satisfaction was assessed via standardized questions. Results There were 447 encounters, with 303 (67.8%) in-person, 98 (21.9%) video, and 46 (10.3%) telephone. Patient satisfaction data was obtained from 251 patients. There was similar patient satisfaction among all encounter modalities. Both patients and physicians were more likely to deem an in-person encounter as complete. Physicians were more likely to report an in-person encounter to be complete for food allergy (p<0.001) and chronic rhinitis (p=0.001) as compared to video or telephone, whereas patients reported in-person encounters for food allergy to be complete as compared to other modalities (p=0.002). Patients reported that future encounter types should depend on the clinical situation. Conclusions There was similar patient satisfaction with in-person, video, and telephone encounters in an allergy/immunology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chronic rhinitis and food allergy are more likely to call for an in-person evaluation. New patient visits are likely to be the most high-yield to focus on for in-person evaluations.","Mustafa, S.

Despite not providing much protection, the custom of wearing masks has prevailed in East Asia from the early stages of the pandemic, especially in Japan, to such an extent that it caused a shortfall in supply. Why do many Japanese people wear masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, even though masks are unlikely to prevent them from getting infected? We examined six possible psychological reasons for wearing masks: three involved expectations about the risk of infection and three involved other driving psychological forces. The results of our nationwide survey revealed that people conformed to societal norms in wearing masks and felt relief from anxiety when wearing masks. However, risk reduction expectations did not affect mask usage. The social psychological motivations successfully explained much about mask usage. Our findings suggest that policymakers responsible for public health should consider social motivations when implementing public strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nakayachi, Kazuya; Ozaki, Taku; Shibata, Yukihide; Yokoi, Ryosuke",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32849127/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01918,636

More than 600,000 of these deaths have occurred in the United States alone. While advances in the treatment of COVID-19 have been made, the advent of highly effective vaccines against this coronavirus variant has given hope that the end of the pandemic may be near. Unfortunately, resistance towards vaccination remains a barrier to virus eradication both in the United States and globally. The driving factor for much of this opposition is the concern over potential adverse reactions from the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. In order to combat this, it is imperative that vaccine side effects and their corresponding clinical course are clearly described.

An international survey,2021-07-17,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, behavioral, and skill responses toward influenza in the general population of Beijing after pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Beijing, China, in January 2011. A survey was conducted in which information was collected using a standardized questionnaire. A comprehensive evaluation index system of health literacy related to influenza was built to evaluate the level of health literacy regarding influenza prevention and control among residents in Beijing. RESULTS: Thirteen thousand and fifty-three valid questionnaires were received. The average score for the sum of knowledge, behavior, and skill was 14.12 ± 3.22, and the mean scores for knowledge, behavior, and skill were 4.65 ± 1.20, 7.25 ± 1.94, and 2.21 ± 1.31, respectively. The qualified proportions of these three sections were 23.7%, 11.9%, and 43.4%, respectively, and the total proportion with a qualified level was 6.7%. There were significant differences in health literacy level related to influenza among the different gender, age, educational level, occupational status, and location groups (p < 0.05). There was a significant association between knowledge and behavior (r = 0.084, p < 0.001), and knowledge and skill (r = 0.102, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The health literacy level remains low among the general population in Beijing and the extent of relativities in knowledge, behavior, and skill about influenza was found to be weak. Therefore, improvements are needed in terms of certain aspects, particularly for the elderly and the population of rural districts. Educational level, as a significant factor in reducing the spread of influenza, should be considered seriously when intervention strategies are implemented.","Zhang, Li; Seale, Holly; Wu, Shuangsheng; Yang, Peng; Zheng, Yang; Ma, Chunna; MacIntyre, Raina; Wang, Quanyi",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971214000393; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2014.01.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24735679/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971214000393,636

597115,Challenges for the dental radiology clinic in times of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-06-20,"ABSTRACT: Nucleic acid therapeutics offer a new paradigm to rapidly respond to global health problems. The versatility of nucleic acids, especially in RNA therapies, provides the ability to tune levels of specific protein expression, achieving downregulation through short interfering RNA (siRNA) or upregulation by messenger RNA (mRNA) administration. Recent advances in the development of delivery vehicles, including nonviral nanoparticles are crucial to overcome the innate barriers to nucleic acid delivery. Toward this end, current clinical approaches have utilized mRNA and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to address the COVID-19 pandemic through novel vaccine strategies, producing efficacious vaccines within one year of sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Here, we review fundamental concepts required to achieve successful nucleic acid delivery, including the design of LNP systems optimized for mRNA vaccine applications.

We have investigated the relationship between the disease severity in COVID‐19, and the PNI and SII scores in the present study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross‐sectional retrospective study included 118 hospitalised patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID‐19. The patients were divided into two groups as those who were hospitalised at the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had been internalised at the clinic (non‐ICU). RESULTS: Of the 118 patients, 50.8% were male. The mean age was 57.7 ± 17.5 years in non‐ICU patients and 70.3 ± 11.7 years in ICU patients and the difference was statistically significant (P < .001). The lymphocyte count and the albumin levels were significantly lower in ICU patients (P < .001, P < .001, respectively). The PNI score was significantly lower in ICU patients compared with non‐ICU patients (P < .001). The SII score was found to be significantly higher in ICU patients compared with non‐ICU patients (P < .001). The value of PNI and SII scores in prediction of the disease severity in COVID‐19 was evaluated with the ROC analysis (PNI: AUC = 0.796, 95%CI: 0.715‐0.877, P < .001; SII: AUC =0.689, 95% CI: 0.559‐0.819, P=.004). When the cut‐off value was taken as ≤36.7 for the PNI score, it was found to have 73.4% sensitivity and 70.8% specificity for predicting of the disease severity and ICU admission probability was 4.4 times higher. When the cut‐off value was taken as ≥813.6 for SII score, it was found to have 70.8% sensitivity and 66.0% specificity for predicting of the disease severity and ICU admission probability was six times higher. CONCLUSION: The PNI and the SII scores are independent predictors of the prognosis and the disease severity in COVID‐19 patients who require hospitalisation at the ICU.","Nalbant, Ahmet; Demirci, Taner; Kaya, Tezcan; Aydın, Ayhan; Altındiş, Mustafa; Güçlü, Ertuğrul",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34137143/,636

In the past, prodrugs were used as a last option; however, nowadays, prodrugs are considered already in the early stages of drug development. Optimal prodrug needs to have effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) features to be chemically stable, to be selective towards the particular site in the body, and to have appropriate safety. Traditional prodrug approach aims to improve physicochemical/biopharmaceutical drug properties; modern prodrugs also include cellular and molecular parameters to accomplish desired drug effect and site-specificity. Here, we present recently investigated prodrugs, their pharmaceutical and clinical advantages, and challenges facing the overall prodrug development. Given examples illustrate that prodrugs can accomplish appropriate solubility, increase permeability, provide site-specific targeting (i.e., to organs, tissues, enzymes, or transporters), overcome rapid drug metabolism, decrease toxicity, or provide better patient compliance, all with the aim to provide optimal drug therapy and outcome. Overall, the prodrug approach is a powerful tool to decrease the time/costs of developing new drug entities and improve overall drug therapy.","Markovic, Milica; Ben-Shabat, Shimon; Dahan, Arik",Pharmaceutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33137942/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics12111031,636

Here, using HIV immunogens with defined valencies ranging from 1 to 60, we investigated the role of antigen valency during different phases of B cell responses in vivo. Highly multimerized immunogens preferentially rapidly activated cognate B cells, with little affinity discrimination. This led to strong early induction of the transcription factors IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4) and Bcl6, driving both early extrafollicular plasma cell and germinal center responses, in a CD4(+) T-cell-dependent manner, involving B cells with a broad range of affinities. Low-valency antigens induced smaller effector B cell responses, with preferential recruitment of high-affinity B cells. Thus, antigen valency has multifaceted effects on B cell responses and can dictate affinity thresholds and competitive landscapes for B cells in vivo, with implications for vaccine design.","Kato, Yu; Abbott, Robert K.; Freeman, Brian L.; Haupt, Sonya; Groschel, Bettina; Silva, Murillo; Menis, Sergey; Irvine, Darrell J.; Schief, William R.; Crotty, Shane",Immunity,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320303344; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32857950/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761320303344; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2020.08.001,636

To achieve high quality assurance, appropriate positive and negative controls are critical for disease detection using RT-PCR kits. In this study, we have found that commercial kits often adopt DNAs instead of RNAs as the positive controls, which can’t report the kit problems in reverse transcription, thereby increasing risk of the false negative results when testing patient samples. To face the challenge, we have proposed and developed the chemically modified RNAs, such as phosphoroselenaote and phosphorothioate RNAs (Se-RNA and S-RNA), as the controls. We have found that while demonstrating the high thermostability, biostability, chemostability and exclusivity (or specificity), both Se-RNA and S-RNA can be fine templates for reverse transcription, indicating their potentials as both positive and negative controls for RT-PCR kits.","Luo, Guangcheng; Zhang, Jun; Zhang, Shun; Hu, Bei; Hu, Lillian; Huang, Zhen",Talanta,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.121850; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039914020311413?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0039914020311413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33379066/,636
598215,Interest in aesthetics during COVID‐19 pandemic: A Google trends analysis,2021-03-31,"The emergence of novel coronavirus mutants is a main factor behind the deterioration of the epidemic situation. Further studies into the pathogenicity of these mutants are thus urgently needed. Binding of the spinous protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor was shown to initiate coronavirus entry into host cells and lead to their infection. The receptor-binding motif (RBM, 438–506) is a region that directly interacts with ACE2 receptor in the RBD and plays a crucial role in determining affinity. To unravel how mutations in the non-RBM regions impact the interaction between RBD and ACE2, we selected three non-RBM mutant systems (N354D, D364Y, and V367F) from the documented clinical cases, and the Q498A mutant system located in the RBM region served as the control. Molecular dynamics simulation was conducted on the mutant systems and the wild-type (WT) system, and verified experiments also performed. Non-RBM mutations have been shown not only to change conformation of the RBM region but also to significantly influence its hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. In particular, the D364Y and V367F systems showed a higher affinity for ACE2 owing to their electrostatic interactions and polar solvation energy changes. In addition, although the binding free energy at this point increased after the mutation of N354D, the conformation of the random coil (Pro384-Asp389) was looser than that of other systems, and the combined effect weakened the binding free energy between RBD and ACE2. Interestingly, we also found a random coil (Ala475-Gly485). This random coil is very sensitive to mutations, and both types of mutations increase the binding free energy of residues in this region. We found that the binding loop (Tyr495-Tyr505) in the RBD domain strongly binds to Lys353, an important residue of the ACE2 domain previously identified. The binding free energy of the non-RBM mutant group at the binding loop had positive and negative changes, and these changes were more obvious than that of the Q498A system. The results of this study elucidate the effect of non-RBM mutation on ACE2-RBD binding, and provide new insights for SARS-CoV-2 mutation research.","Du, Yaoqiang; Wang, Hao; Chen, Linjie; Fang, Quan; Zhang, Biqin; Jiang, Luxi; Wu, Zhaoyu; Yang, Yexiaoqing; Zhou, Ying; Chen, Bingyu; Lyu, Jianxin; Wang, Zhen",Front Mol Biosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2021.614443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34386518/,636

We evaluate potential vaccine research strategies under a range of epidemic conditions determined, in part, by the intensity of public health interventions. Methods: We constructed a compartmental epidemiological model incorporating public health interventions, vaccine efficacy trials and a post-trial population vaccination campaign. The model was used to estimate the duration and benefits of large-scale field trials in comparison with HICS accompanied by an expanded safety trial, and to assess the marginal risk faced by HICS participants. Results: Field trials may demonstrate vaccine efficacy more rapidly than a HICS strategy under epidemic conditions consistent with moderate mitigation policies. A HICS strategy is the only feasible option for testing vaccine efficacy under epidemic suppression, and maximises the benefits of post-trial vaccination. Less successful or absent mitigation results in minimal or no benefit from post-trial vaccination, irrespective of trial design. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 HICS are the optimal method of vaccine testing for populations maintained under epidemic suppression, where vaccination offers the greatest benefits to the local population.","Heriot, G.

ACE2 and TMPRSS2, host molecules required for viral entry, are regulated by sex steroids and expressed in the placenta. We sought to investigate whether placental ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression vary by fetal sex and in the presence of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Placental ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were quantified in 68 pregnant individuals (38 SARS-CoV-2 positive, 30 SARS-CoV-2 negative) delivering at Mass General Brigham from April to June 2020. Maternal SARS-CoV-2 status was determined by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. Placental SARS-CoV-2 viral load was quantified. RTqPCR was performed to quantify expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 relative to the reference gene YWHAZ. Western blots were performed on placental homogenates to quantify protein levels. The impact of fetal sex and SARS-CoV-2 exposure on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was analyzed by 2-way ANOVA. Results SARS-CoV-2 virus was undetectable in all placentas. Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection impacted TMPRSS2 placental gene and protein expression in a sexually dimorphic fashion (2-way ANOVA interaction p-value: 0.002). We observed no impact of fetal sex or maternal SARS-CoV-2 status on placental ACE2 gene or protein expression. Placental TMPRSS2 expression was significantly correlated with ACE2 expression in males (Spearman’s ρ=0.54, p=0.02) but not females (ρ=0.23, p=0.34) exposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions Sex differences in placental TMPRSS2 but not ACE2 were observed in the setting of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a chest ultrasound screening program in nursing homes for detecting coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)-related pneumonia and improving the appropriateness of hospital referral of residents. Design Pragmatic, descriptive, feasibility study from April 2nd to April 9th, 2020. Setting and participants: A total of 83 older residents (age 85±8) presenting mild to moderate respiratory symptoms and not previously tested for COVID-19, residing in five nursing homes in Northern Italy. Methods Chest ultrasound was performed at the bedside by a team of hospital specialists with certified expertise in thoracic ultrasonography, following a systematic approach exploring four different areas for each hemithorax, from the anterior and posterior side. Presence of ultrasonographic signs of interstitial pneumonia, including comet-tail artifacts (B-lines) with focal or diffuse distribution, subpleural consolidations and pleural line indentation was detected. The specialist team integrated ultrasound data with clinical and anamnestic information, and gave personalized therapeutic advice for each patient, including hospital referral when needed. Results The most frequent reasons for ultrasound evaluation were fever (63% of participants) and mild dyspnea (40%). Fifty-six patients (67%) had abnormal ultrasound findings. The most common patterns were presence of multiple subpleural consolidations (32 patients) and diffuse B-lines (24 patients), with bilateral involvement. A diagnosis of suspect COVID-19 pneumonia was made in 44 patients, and six of them required hospitalization. Twelve patients had ultrasound patterns suggesting other respiratory diseases, and two patients with normal ultrasound findings were diagnosed with COPD exacerbation.

In Portugal, telemedicine is currently outside what is considered acceptable practice by the regulator, the Portuguese Veterinary Order (Ordem dos Médicos Veterinários). As part of a wider research aimed at gathering evidence for developing a new veterinary Code of Professional Conduct, this study describes the use of the Policy Delphi technique to gather the views and perceptions of a purposeful sample of 41 Portuguese veterinarians regarding telemedicine. Four main issues were addressed using mixed research methods: teleconsultation, teleconsulting, teleadvice, and the regulator's role. Responses highlight participants' perception of both the relevance of medical digital technologies in improving healthcare and their limitations. Overall opinion was that, although restrictions to remote veterinary practice should be reduced, improved guidance and regulation are warranted. Eighty percent of participants considered that limits to the use of veterinary telemedicine should be imposed and two thirds considered that a remote consultation must always be preceded by a face-to-face consultation. While most respondents thought that vet-to-vet teleconsulting using social media (namely Facebook) should not be banned, 83% recognized that it should be regulated by ethical standards. Participants' concerns with telemedicine had mostly to do with reputational risk for the veterinary profession, while overlooking privacy or confidentiality issues. A consultative group should be established to ensure that telemedicine providers comply with professional requirements. It is expected that these results will support policy-making by the Portuguese Veterinary Order and by veterinary regulators at other jurisdictions.","Magalhães-Sant'Ana, Manuel; Peleteiro, Maria Conceição; Stilwell, George",Front Vet Sci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32974405/,636

600801,Editorial. Neurosurgical priority setting during a pandemic: COVID-19,2020-04-17,"Abstract Importance The antimalarial agents chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been proposed as a potential treatment for COVID-19 due their effect on several cellular processes that impact viral replication. Although more than 100 ongoing trials are testing their efficacy, CQ and HCQ are being used widely in clinical practice, exposing COVID-19 patients to potentially significant cardiac adverse effects. Objective To systematically review the literature and estimate the risk of cardiac toxicity in patients receiving CQ or HCQ for COVID-19. Data Sources A systematic search was conducted on May 27, 2020 of Ovid EBM Reviews, Ovid Embase (1974+), Ovid Medline (1946+ including epub ahead of print, in-process & other non-indexed citations), Scopus (1970+) and Web of Science (1975+) and preprint servers (Medrvix and ResearchSquare) and manual search of references lists. Study Selection Studies that included COVID-19 patients treated with CQ or HCQ, with or without azithromycin, were included as follows: (1) COVID-19 patient population, (2) the study included more than 10 patients receiving either one of the medications, (3) reported electrocardiographic changes and/or cardiac arrhythmias. Data Extraction and Synthesis Study characteristics and endpoints incidence were extracted. Due to the very low incidence of torsades de pointes (TdP) and other endpoints (rare events), the arcsine transformation was used to obtain a pooled estimate of the different incidences using a random-effects meta-analysis. Meta-regression analyses were used to assess whether the incidence of different endpoints significantly varied by multiple study-level variables specified a priori. Main Outcomes and Measures Pooled Incidence of: (1) change in QTc value from baseline [â¥] 60 ms, (2) QTc [â¥] 500 ms, (3) the composite of endpoint 1 and 2, (4) TdP arrhythmia or ventricular tachycardia (VT) or cardiac arrest, (5) discontinuation of treatment due to drug-induced QT prolongation or arrhythmias. Results A total of 19 studies with a total of 5652 patients were included. All included studies were of high methodological quality in terms of exposure ascertainment or outcome assessment. Among 2719 patients treated with CQ or HCQ, only two episodes of TdP were reported; the pooled incidence of TdP arrhythmia or VT or cardiac arrest was 3 per 1000, 95% CI (0-21), I2=96%, 18 studies with 3725 patients. Among 13 studies of 4334 patients, the pooled incidence of discontinuation of CQ or HCQ due to prolonged QTc or arrhythmias was 5%, 95% CI (1-11), I2=98%. The pooled incidence of change in QTc from baseline of [â¥] 60 ms was 7%, 95% CI (3-14), I2=94% (12 studies of 2008 patients). The pooled incidence of QTc [â¥] 500 ms was 6%, 95% CI (2-12), I2=95% (16 studies of 2317 patients). Among 11 studies of 3127 patients, the pooled incidence of change in QTc from baseline of [â¥] 60 ms or QTc [â¥] 500 ms was 9%, 95% CI (3-17), I2=97%. Mean/median age, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, concomitant QT prolonging medications, ICU care, and severity of illness in the study populations explained between-studies heterogeneity. Conclusions and Relevance Treatment of COVID-19 patients with CQ or HCQ is associated with a significant risk of drug-induced QT prolongation, which is a harbinger for drug-induced TdP/VT or cardiac arrest.

SUBJECT AND METHODS: The study adopted qualitative and interpretative methods of social research, including content analysis and a perception study of 223 respondents through a semi-structured questionnaire survey, who were selected using purposive random sampling. The data obtained from the perception study was further complemented through phone interviews. RESULTS: The study found that the pandemic has not affected all mothers uniformly; rather, the intensity of its impact varied depending on factors such as the occupation of mothers and their husbands and their family pattern. Despite such variation, all mothers experienced a subsequent increase in workload, challenges while availing routine health facilities and higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression and certain behavioural changes. CONCLUSION: However, the worst affected have been the mothers belonging to the lower socio-economic strata because the pandemic has made them and their husbands jobless, leading them towards an uncertain future.","Ehsan, Shah Md.

A total of 72 water samples collected from the study area were analysed and their results show that the pH average value ranges from 6.2 in the dry to 8.5 in the rainy seasons for surface water, 6.6 and 8.3 for shallow well water and 6.5 to 8.4 for borehole water. The turbidity in surface water varies from 8.1 to 26.2 Formazin Attenuation Unit (FAU), 0.3 to 2.9 FAU in shallow well water and 0.4 to 4.8 FAU in borehole water. Electrical conductivity (EC) value varies from 1010 to 1840 μs/cm for surface water, 201 to 950 μs/cm for shallow well water and 670 to 1650 μs/cm for borehole water. Total dissolved solids range from 0.1 to 2.6 mg/l in surface water, 0.2 to 4.1 mg/l in shallow well water and 0.3 to 4.4 mg/l in borehole water. The value of the total hardness ranges from 44 to 120 mg in surface water, 46 to 96 mg in shallow well water and 70 to 130 mg in borehole water. The nitrate value ranges from 1.1 to 10.6 mg in surface water, 3.0 to 8.4 mg in shallow well water and 3.7 to 9.6 mg in borehole water. The value of sulphate content varies from 4.6 to 38.5 mg in surface water, 6.2 to 34.8 mg in shallow well water and 5.7 to 55.7 mg in borehole water. The value of phosphate concentrations in surface water varies from 1.0 to 9.0 mg, 0.7 to 3.4 mg in shallow well water and 1.0 to 4.7 mg in borehole water. The bacteriological analysis using the membrane filtration technique revealed the presence of faecal bacteria and total coliform counts. The presence of the analysed twin contaminants in the studied water resources reduced their water quality. The physicochemical and bacteriological data were subjected to statistical and correlation tests. It was concluded that their concentration levels were independent of intra-seasonal changes. The likely natural and artificial sources of contaminants are run-offs from fertilized lands, septic tanks, industrial discharges, sewage and waste disposal, algae blooms and erosion from natural deposits. The inherent risk is water-related diseases such as waterborne diseases, water-washed diseases, water-based diseases and diseases transmitted by water-related insect vectors. Water resources should be protected through proper sanitation systems, limiting of up-stream discharges, maintenance of wellheads, boiling and municipal water treatment plants. Educational advice should be given to the inhabitants on the dangers posed by continuous drinking of contaminated water. These measures will prevent disease outbreak and public health burden in the area.","Ocheli, Azuka; Otuya, Onyeka Benjamin; Umayah, Star Otitie",Environ Monit Assess,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361854/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08302-5,636
601467,Importance of Patient Advocacy During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-09-19,"INTRODUCTION: As the global epidemic continues to spread, countries have tapped effective drugs to treat new coronavirus pneumonia. The therapeutic effect of the traditional Chinese medicine Lianhua Qingwen in this new coronary pneumonia epidemic has attracted attention from all walks of life, and relevant research reports continue to appear. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the clinical efficacy and safety of the traditional Chinese medicine Lianhua Qingwen in the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) (referred to as ""new coronary pneumonia""), and evaluated the overall level of research quality. METHODS: We searched seven databases and retrieved the Chinese Journal Full-text Database (CNKI), Vip Database (VIP), China Biomedicine (SinoMed), Wanfang Database and PubMed, Cochrane Central, EMBASE from October 2019 to May 2020 Literature references. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that tested the efficacy of the traditional Chinese medicine lotus clearing plague in the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia. The authors extracted data and independently assessed quality. We used Stata15.1 software to analyze the data of randomized trials. RESULTS: A total of 2 articles were identified, including 154 patients. All the participating patients were diagnosed with new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). The meta-analysis results showed that the disappearance rate of the main clinical symptoms of Chinese medicine Lianhua Qingwen in the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia was significantly higher than that of the control group [OR = 3.34, 95% CI (2.06, 5.44), P <0.001]; the disappearance rate of other clinical secondary symptoms is significantly higher than the control group [OR = 6.54, 95% CI (3.59, 11.90), P <0.001]. The duration of fever was significantly lower than that of the control group [OR = -1.04, 95% CI (-1.60, -0.49), P <0.001]. It is confirmed that the traditional Chinese medicine Lianhua Qingwen treatment improves the clinical effectiveness, and also has certain advantages in relieving cough and fever. CONCLUSION: The treatment of new pneumonia with traditional Chinese medicine lotus clearing plague can be used as an effective therapy to improve the clinical symptoms of new coronary pneumonia. More rigorous design, multi-center, and prospective RCTs are necessary to further determine the effectiveness and safety of the traditional Chinese medicine lotus decoction in the treatment of new pneumonia.","Zeng, Mengjie; Li, Linjun; Wu, Zhiquan",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238828; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32915877/,636

Debido al colapso hospitalario se han suspendido consultas, pruebas diagnósticas e intervenciones quirúrgicas, con el objetivo también de reducir la exposición de pacientes al SARS-CoV-2 en el medio hospitalario. Sin embargo, esto ha provocado un retraso en la atención de otros problemas sanitarios. Material y Métodos: Analizamos y comparamos los datos de la Unidad de Mama en un hospital de segundo nivel, en cuanto a la actividad del Programa de Diagnóstico Precoz de Cáncer de Mama (PDPCM), los diagnósticos de cáncer realizados, así como las pacientes intervenidas durante los meses de marzo a mayo de 2020, con respecto al mismo período del año anterior. Resultados: El número de pacientes atendidas en el PDPCM en los meses de marzo a mayo de 2020 se ha reducido en un 91.7%, y las pacientes atendidas en el Servicio de Radiodiagnóstico del hospital en un 54.2%. La actividad quirúrgica también se ha visto mermada en un 57.69% con respecto al mismo periodo del año anterior. Conclusiones. La disminución de la actividad del PDPCM y Radiología conllevan a un retraso diagnóstico que concluirá con un aumento de lista de espera y demora en el tratamiento, lo que posiblemente derive en un diagnóstico en estadios más avanzados de la enfermedad. Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed routine clinical activity in the last few months. Because our hospital was overwhelmed and to prevent patient exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting, consultations, diagnostic tests, and surgical interventions have been postponed. However, this has provoked a delay in the care of other health problems. Material and methods: We analysed and compared the data from the breast unit of a second-level hospital in terms of the activity of the Early Breast Cancer Detection Programme (EBCDP), the cancer diagnoses made, and the patients undergoing surgery from March to May, 2020, compared with the same period in the previous year. Results: The number of patients attended in the EBCDP in March and May decreased by 91.7% and those attended in the Radiodiagnostics Service of the hospital fell by 54.2%. Surgical activity also decreased by 57.69% compared with the same period in 2019. Conclusions. The decrease in the activity of the EBCDP and Radiology Service have led to a diagnostic delay which will, in turn, increase waiting lists and delay treatment. These factors will possibly lead to tumours being diagnosed in more advanced stages.","Lucena, Miriam Alcaide; Martínez, Carlos Martínez; González, Carlos José Rodríguez; Carbonero, Gerardo Ayala; Daza, Andrés Bosquet; Álvarez, Marta Legerén; de Reyes Lartategui, Saturnino",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0214158220301456?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0214158220301456,636

This review summarizes the latest advances and the main technical issues that determine the success of this technology. The pathway from editing to printing, from engineering the genome to achieving the desired animals, does not always imply an easy, fast and safe journey. When applied in large animals, CRISPR involves time- and cost-consuming projects, and it is mandatory not only to choose the best approach for genome editing, but also for embryo production, zygote microinjection or electroporation, cryopreservation and embryo transfer. The main technical refinements and most frequent questions to improve this disruptive biotechnology in large animals are presented. In addition, we discuss some CRISPR applications to enhance livestock production in the context of a growing global demand of food, in terms of increasing efficiency, reducing the impact of farming on the environment, enhancing pest control, animal welfare and health. The challenge is no longer technical. Controversies and consensus, opportunities and threats, benefits and risks, ethics and science should be reconsidered to enter into the CRISPR era.","Menchaca, A.; dos Santos-Neto, P.C.; Mulet, A.P.; Crispo, M.",Theriogenology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.01.063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32088034/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0093691X20300765; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093691X20300765,636

The recombinant virus, which expresses spike with the three substitutions, was nonfusogenic at neutral pH. Its replication was significantly inhibited by lysosomotropic agents, and it was highly neuroattenuated in vivo. In contrast, the recombinant expressing spike with L1114R alone mediated cell-to-cell fusion at neutral pH and replicated efficiently despite the presence of lysosomotropic agents; however, it still caused only subclinical morbidity and no mortality in animals. Thus, both recombinant viruses were highly attenuated and expressed viral antigen which was restricted to the olfactory bulbs and was markedly absent from other regions of the brains at 5 days postinfection. These data demonstrate that amino acid substitutions, in particular L1114R, within HR1 of the JHM spike reduced the ability of MHV to spread in the central nervous system. Furthermore, the requirements for low pH for fusion and viral entry are not prerequisites for the highly attenuated phenotype.","Tsai, Jean C; Groot, Linda de; Pinon, Josefina D; Iacono, Kathryn T; Phillips, Joanna J; Seo, Su-hun; Lavi, Ehud; Weiss, Susan R",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682203002484; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682203002484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12919742/,636

Major phenotypes include recurrent respiratory tract infections and bronchiectasis, aspiration, respiratory muscle abnormalities, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary fibrosis. At present, no effective pulmonary therapy for A-T exists. Cell therapy using adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (ASCs) might be a promising approach for tissue regeneration. The aim of the present project was to investigate whether ASCs migrate into the injured lung parenchyma of Atm-deficient mice as an indication of incipient tissue damage during A-T. Therefore, ASCs isolated from luciferase transgenic mice (mASCs) were intravenously transplanted into Atm-deficient and wild-type mice. Retention kinetics of the cells were monitored using in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and completed by subsequent verification using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The in vivo imaging and the qPCR results demonstrated migration accompanied by a significantly longer retention time of transplanted mASCs in the lung parenchyma of Atm-deficient mice compared to wild type mice. In conclusion, our study suggests incipient damage in the lung parenchyma of Atm-deficient mice. In addition, our data further demonstrate that a combination of luciferase-based PCR together with BLI is a pivotal tool for tracking mASCs after transplantation in models of inflammatory lung diseases such as A-T.","Baer, Patrick C.; Sann, Julia; Duecker, Ruth Pia; Ullrich, Evelyn; Geiger, Helmut; Bader, Peter; Zielen, Stefan; Schubert, Ralf",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9061444; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32531978/,636

Using multiple countries, data streams and methods, we estimated that, when unconstrained, European COVID-19 confirmed cases doubled on average every 3 days (range 2.2–4.3 days) and Italian hospital and intensive care unit admissions every 2–3 days; values that are significantly lower than the 5–7 days dominating the early published literature. Furthermore, we showed that the impact of physical distancing interventions was typically not seen until at least 9 days after implementation, during which time confirmed cases could grow eightfold. We argue that such temporal patterns are more critical than precise estimates of the time-insensitive basic reproduction number R(0) for initiating interventions, and that the combination of fast growth and long detection delays explains the struggle in countries' outbreak response better than large values of R(0) alone. One year on from first reporting these results, reproduction numbers continue to dominate the media and public discourse, but robust estimates of unconstrained growth remain essential for planning worst-case scenarios, and detection delays are still key in informing the relaxation and re-implementation of interventions.

The role of constructive patriotism, conventional patriotism, and glorification amid the COVID‐19 pandemic",2021-05-11,"A predator–prey model with disease infection in both populations is proposed to account for the possibility of a contagious disease crossing species barrier from prey to predator. We obtain several threshold parameters from local analysis of various equilibria of the proposed system as well as coupled conditions on these threshold parameters which determine the stability of these equilibria. One of the coupled conditions, in the form of an ecological threshold number for the predator–prey ecosystem, always determines the coexistence of predators and prey. The other condition, in the form of a disease basic reproduction number, dictates whether the disease will become endemic in the ecosystem. Under one combination of these coupled conditions, a highly infectious disease could drive the predators to extinction when predators and prey would have coexisted without the disease. For another combination of the conditions, the predation of the more vulnerable infected prey could cause the disease to be eradicated in the ecosystem, in some case even approaching a disease-free periodic solution, when the disease would have otherwise remained endemic in the prey population in the absence of predation. This indicates that the presence of disease in both predators and prey could either promote or impair coexistence, and its precise impact needs to be explored specifically in each particular situation. By considering disease infection in both populations, our model also yields more complex dynamics, allowing for the possibility of bistability and periodic oscillation, in either disease-free or endemic states, in the ecosystem for which the conditions are obtained analytically and with the help of numerical simulations.","Hsieh, Ying-Hen; Hsiao, Chin-Kuei",Math Med Biol,https://doi.org/10.1093/imammb/dqn017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18701422/,636

DESIGN: The long covid Symptom and Impact Tools (ST and IT) were constructed from the answers to a survey with open-ended questions to 492 patients with long COVID. Validation of the tools involved adult patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and symptoms extending over three weeks after onset. Construct validity was assessed by examining the relations of the ST and IT scores with health related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), function (PCFS, post-COVID functional scale), and perceived health (MYMOP2). Reliability was determined by a test-retest. The ""patient acceptable symptomatic state"" (PASS) was determined by the percentile method. RESULTS: Validation involved 1022 participants (55% with confirmed COVID-19, 79% female, and 12.5% hospitalized for COVID-19). The long COVID ST and IT scores were strongly correlated with the EQ-5D-5L (r(s) = -0.45 and r(s) = -0.59 respectively), the PCFS (r(s) = -0.39 and r(s) = -0.55), and the MYMOP2 (r(s) = -0.40 and r(s) = -0.59). Reproducibility was excellent with an interclass correlation coefficient of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.86) for the ST score and 0.84 (0.80 to 0.87) for the IT score. In total, 793 (77.5%) patients reported an unacceptable symptomatic state, thereby setting the PASS for the long covid IT score at 30 (28 to 33).

The complement system is an important component of innate immunity and can stimulate inflammation, but its role in COVID-19 is unknown. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal, single center study was performed in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Plasma concentrations of complement factors C3a, C3c, and terminal complement complex (TCC) were assessed at baseline and during hospital admission. In parallel, routine laboratory and clinical parameters were collected from medical files and analyzed. RESULTS: Complement factors C3a, C3c, and TCC were significantly increased in plasma of patients with COVID-19 compared with healthy controls (P < .05). These complement factors were especially elevated in intensive care unit patients during the entire disease course (P < .005 for C3a and TCC). More intense complement activation was observed in patients who died and in those with thromboembolic events. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 demonstrate activation of the complement system, which is related to disease severity. This pathway may be involved in the dysregulated proinflammatory response associated with increased mortality rate and thromboembolic complications.

NK cells develop from a common lymphoid precursor resident in the bone marrow (BM) that is considered the main site of their generation. The BM microenvironment provides a rich source of cytokines and growth factors and allows intimate contact between developing NK cells and stromal cells, which is required for their full maturation. Individual NK cell subsets displaying unique functional features, and tissue locations have been identified both in mouse and humans. Involvement of chemokines in the regulation of DC-mediated NK cell priming and effector functions has also been documented and should be taken into account when analyzing the role of chemokines in NK cell-dependent immune responses. Studies in man and mouse have shown that NK cells are distributed in several organs under normal conditions. Their frequency is comparatively high in nonlymphoid organs such as the lung, the liver and the mucosal tissue of maternal uterus, and rare in thymus and lymph nodes. Chemotactic factors, including chemokines, play critical roles in the regulation of NK cell migration across endothelium and into the tissues. The differences in chemokine receptor expression together with distinct adhesive properties of different NK cell subsets as well as activated NK cells, imply that they have multiple routes of circulation and trafficking patterns. Besides their role in the regulation of NK cell trafficking, chemotactic molecules can also affect NK cell effector functions by regulating their priming and their ability to kill and secrete cytokines.","Gismondi, Angela; Bernardini, Giovanni; Santoni, Angela",Natural Killer Cells,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123704542000156; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123704542000156,636

However, high ventilation rates may result in high energy costs. Ventilative cooling (VC), which requires high ventilation rates like DV, is an option to reduce the cooling energy consumption. By combining DV and VC, this paper investigated the operation of the mechanical ventilation system in high-rise buildings during the COVID-19 pandemic, aiming to minimizing the cooling related energy consumption and reducing COVID-19 transmission. First, a modified Wells-Riley model was proposed to calculate DV rates. The ventilation rate required to achieve VC was also introduced. Then, a new ventilation control strategy was proposed for achieving DV and VC. Finally, a case study was conducted on a real high-rise building, where the required DV rate and the impact of the settings of the mechanical ventilation on the energy savings were evaluated. The results indicate that the required ventilation rates vary from 36 m(3)/s to 3306 m(3)/s depending on the protective measures.

This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with diabetes, admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the southern region of Bangladesh. METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, treatments, complications, and clinical outcomes data were extracted from electronic medical records of 168 COVID-19 patients admitted into ICU of two COVID-19 dedicated hospitals of Chattogram, Bangladesh and compared between diabetes (n = 88) and non-diabetes (n = 80) groups. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes was high among 51–70 years old patients. All the diabetic patients had at least one other comorbidity, with a significantly higher incidence of hypertension (53.4% vs 27.5%, P < 0.05). Prevalence of male patients (74/88; 84.1%) was slightly higher among diabetic patients than the non-diabetic patients (60/80; 75%). Even though not significant, Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a shorter overall survival time than those without diabetes. In subgroup analysis, diabetic patients were classified into insulin-requiring and non-insulin-requiring groups based on their requirement of insulin during the stay in ICU. COVID-19 infected diabetic patients requiring insulin have high risk of disease progression and shorter survival time than the non-insulin required group. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is an independent risk factor for the poor prognosis of COVID-19.

Therefore, this cross-sectional study explored self-reported changes in physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior, and screen time among informal caregivers providing care for older adults aged 50+ during the pandemic. METHODS: Study participants were recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and reported their perceived changes (increased a lot, increased a little, remained the same, decreased a little, decreased a lot) in moderate-intensity PA (MPA), vigorous-intensity PA (VPA), sedentary behavior, and screen time (weekday and weekend) during the pandemic. For analytic purposes, response categories were categorized into three-level ordinal variables—increased (increased a lot, increased a little), no change (remained the same), decreased (decreased a little, decreased a lot). Multinomial logistic regression models assessed the likelihood of changes (vs. no change) in MPA, VPA, sedentary behavior, and screen time (weekday, weekend) based on caregiving and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: In total, 2574 individuals accessed the study link, 464 of whom did not meet eligibility requirements. In addition, people who completed 80% or less of the survey (n = 1171) and/or duplicate IP addresse (n = 104) were excluded, resulting in an analytic sample of n = 835. The sample was 69% male, had a mean age of 34 (SD = 9.7), and 48% reported increased VPA, while 55% reported increased MPA. The majority also reported increased sedentary behavior, as well as increased screen time. Respondents living with their care recipient were more likely to report increased weekday screen time (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.55, 95% CI 1.11–2.16) and sedentary behavior (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.28–2.53) than respondents not living with the care recipient.

In addition, travel has become less safe in the era of COVID-19. This study demonstrates surgeon satisfaction and safety with tele-proctoring in robotic gynecologic surgery. This pilot study assesses surgeon satisfaction and operative outcomes with a novel operative tele-proctoring system with a continuous two-way video-audio feed that allows the off-site surgeon to see the operating room, surgical field, and hands of the robotic surgeon. After thorough system testing, two experienced surgeons underwent tele-proctoring for hospital credentialing, completing 7 total cases. Each completed pre- and post-surveys developed from the Michigan Standard Simulation Experience Scale. Surgical characteristics were compared between tele-proctored cases and 59 historical cases proctored in-person over the last 8 years. Surgeons reported unanimous high satisfaction with tele-proctoring (5 ± 0). There were no major technologic issues. Five of the tele-proctored cases and 35 of controls were hysterectomies. Mean age was 48.2 ± 1.4 years, mean BMI was 29.6 ± 0.9 kg/m(2), and mean uterine weight was 152 ± 112.3 g. Two-thirds had prior abdominal surgery (P > 0.1). Tele-proctored hysterectomies were 58 ± 6.5 min shorter than controls (P = 0.001). There were no differences in EBL or complication rates (P > 0.1). Tele-proctoring resulted in high surgeon satisfaction rates with no difference in EBL or complications.

However, little is known about the clinical outcomes among hospitalized patients with active COVID-19 after in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). AIM: We aimed to characterize outcomes from IHCA in patients with COVID-19 and to identify patient- and hospital-level variables associated with 30-day survival. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre retrospective cohort study across 11 academic medical centres in the U.S. Adult patients who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation and/or defibrillation for IHCA between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 who had a documented positive test for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 were included. The primary outcome was 30-day survival after IHCA. RESULTS: There were 260 IHCAs among COVID-19 patients during the study period. The median age was 69 years (interquartile range 60-77), 71.5% were male, 49.6% were White, 16.9% were Black, and 16.2% were Hispanic. The most common presenting rhythms were pulseless electrical activity (45.0%) and asystole (44.6%). ROSC occurred in 58 patients (22.3%), 32 (12.3%) survived to 30 days, and 31 (11.9%) survived to discharge. Rates of ROSC and 30-day survival in the two hospitals with the highest volume of IHCA over the study period compared to the remaining hospitals were considerably lower (10.8% vs. 64.3% and 5.9% vs. 35.7% respectively, p < 0.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: We found rates of ROSC and 30-day survival of 22.3% and 12.3% respectively.

Many healthcare facilities in the US and elsewhere adopted 'No-Visitor Rules' in an effort to contain the virus, but these rules mean that the countless people in nursing homes and hospital wards were isolated during their final hours of life. There is no epidemiological or US federal or state requirement to prohibit visitation to (and thereby isolate) dying patients-even those with COVID-19. Instead, constructing pandemic-specific visitation policies is usually left to the discretion of hospitals and healthcare providers. Such policies aim to limit the risk of exposure but fail to account for the individual and social costs associated with dying alone for patients, families, and frontline healthcare workers. As a result, the policies may be overly restrictive and actively cause harm. This article argues that US hospital visitation policies need to be democratised to include the perspectives of community members and patients. By drawing on existing patient rights frameworks, this article outlines several legal strategies to reconceptualise hospital visitation policies as a civil rights issue.","Sudai, Maayan",Medical law review,https://doi.org/10.1093/medlaw/fwab033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34516630/,636

Moreover, low-cost sensors might allow for better characterization of personal exposure to PM(2.5). In this study, we use 500 dust (PM(2.5)) sensors mounted on bicycles to estimate typical PM(2.5) levels to which cyclists are exposed in the province of Utrecht, the Netherlands, in the year 2020. We use co-located sensors at reference stations to calibrate and validate the mobile sensor data. We estimate that the average exposure to traffic related PM(2).(5,) on top of background concentrations, is approximately 2 μg/m(3). Our results suggest that cyclists close to major roads have a small, but consistently higher exposure to PM(2.5) compared to routes with less traffic. The results allow for a detailed spatial representation of PM(2.5) concentrations and show that choosing a different cycle route might lead to a lower exposure to PM(2.5).

However, despite significant progress on elucidating the function of key proteins involved in reproduction, understanding male reproductive physiology is limited by incomplete information on the genes expressed in reproductive tissues, and no contraceptive targets have so far reached clinical trials. To advance product development, further identification of novel reproductive tract-specific genes leading to potentially druggable protein targets is imperative. RESULTS: In this study, we expand on previous single tissue, single species studies by integrating analysis of publicly available human and mouse RNA-seq datasets whose initial published purpose was not focused on identifying male reproductive tract-specific targets. We also incorporate analysis of additional newly acquired human and mouse testis and epididymis samples to increase the number of targets identified. We detected a combined total of 1178 genes for which no previous evidence of male reproductive tract-specific expression was annotated, many of which are potentially druggable targets. Through RT-PCR, we confirmed the reproductive tract-specific expression of 51 novel orthologous human and mouse genes without a reported mouse model. Of these, we ablated four epididymis-specific genes (Spint3, Spint4, Spint5, and Ces5a) and two testis-specific genes (Pp2d1 and Saxo1) in individual or double knockout mice generated through the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Our results validate a functional requirement for Spint4/5 and Ces5a in male mouse fertility, while demonstrating that Spint3, Pp2d1, and Saxo1 are each individually dispensable for male mouse fertility.

It has been proven that there is a direct link between the strength or weakness of the immune system and the spread of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis, AIDS, and Covid-19 as soon as the immune system has no the power to fight infections and infectious diseases. Moreover, it has been proven that mathematical modeling is a great tool to accurately describe complex biological phenomena. In the recent literature, we can easily find that these effective tools provide important contributions to our understanding and analysis of such problems such as tumor growth. This is indeed one of the main reasons for the need to study computational models of how the immune system interacts with other factors involved. To this end, in this paper, we present some new approximate solutions to a computational formulation that models the interaction between tumor growth and the immune system with several fractional and fractal operators. The operators used in this model are the Liouville–Caputo, Caputo–Fabrizio, and Atangana–Baleanu–Caputo in both fractional and fractal-fractional senses. The existence and uniqueness of the solution in each of these cases is also verified. To complete our analysis, we include numerous numerical simulations to show the behavior of tumors. These diagrams help us explain mathematical results and better describe related biological concepts. In many cases the approximate results obtained have a chaotic structure, which justifies the complexity of unpredictable and uncontrollable behavior of cancerous tumors. As a result, the newly implemented operators certainly open new research windows in further computational models arising in the modeling of different diseases. It is confirmed that similar problems in the field can be also be modeled by the approaches employed in this paper.","Ghanbari, Behzad",Adv Differ Equ,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13662-020-03040-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33101402/,636

Radiation dose, patient positioning time, and off-center distance of the two groups were recorded and compared. Image noise and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were assessed by three experienced radiologists and were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The AP operation was successful for all patients in the AP group and reduced the total positioning time by 28% compared with the MP group. Compared with the MP group, the AP group had significantly less patient off-center distance (AP 1.56 cm ± 0.83 vs. MP 4.05 cm ± 2.40, p < 0.001) and higher proportion of positioning accuracy (AP 99% vs. MP 92%), resulting in 16% radiation dose reduction (AP 6.1 mSv ± 1.3 vs. MP 7.3 mSv ± 1.2, p < 0.001) and 9% image noise reduction in erector spinae and lower noise and higher SNR for lesions in the pulmonary peripheral areas. CONCLUSION: The AI-based automatic positioning and centering in CT imaging is a promising new technique for reducing radiation dose and optimizing imaging workflow and image quality in imaging the chest. KEY POINTS: • The AI-based automatic positioning (AP) operation was successful for all patients in our study. • AP method reduced the total positioning time by 28% compared with the manual positioning (MP). • AP method had less patient off-center distance and higher proportion of positioning accuracy than MP method, resulting in 16% radiation dose reduction and 9% image noise reduction in erector spinae.","Gang, Yadong; Chen, Xiongfeng; Li, Huan; Wang, Hanlun; Li, Jianying; Guo, Ying; Zeng, Junjie; Hu, Qiang; Hu, Jinxiang; Xu, Haibo",Eur Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740092/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07629-4,636
609862,Recommendations for the surgical management of gynecological cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic - FRANCOGYN group for the CNGOF.,2020-04-01,"Pseudothrombocytopenia (PTCP), a relative common finding in clinical laboratories, can lead to diagnostic errors, overtreatment, and further (even invasive) unnecessary testing. Clinical consequences with potential life-threatening events (e.g., unnecessary platelet transfusion, inappropriate treatment including splenectomy or corticosteroids) are still observed when PTCP is not readily detected. The phenomenon is even more complex when occurring with different anticoagulants. In this review we present a case of multi-anticoagulant PTCP, where we studied different parameters including temperature, amikacin supplementation, measurement methods, and type of anticoagulant. Prevalence, clinical risk factors, pre-analytical and analytical factors, along with clinical implications, will be discussed. The detection of an anticoagulant-dependent PTCP does not necessarily imply the presence of specific disorders. Conversely, the incidence of PTCP seems higher in patients receiving low molecular weight heparin, during hospitalization, or in men aged 50 years or older. New analytical technologies, such as fluorescence or optical platelet counting, will be soon overturning traditional algorithms and represent valuable diagnostic aids. A practical laboratory approach, based on current knowledge of PTCP, is finally proposed for overcoming spuriously low platelet counts.","Lardinois, Benjamin; Favresse, Julien; Chatelain, Bernard; Lippi, Giuseppe; Mullier, François",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33557431/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10040594,636
611122,Treatment of primary and metastatic peritoneal tumors in the Covid-19 pandemic,2020-04-23,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions in cancer care, and preliminary research suggests that these disruptions are associated with increased levels of psychosocial distress among cancer survivors. The purpose of this study was to offer a descriptive report of the psychosocial functioning, perceived risk and fear of cancer progression, and COVID-19 pandemic impact and experiences in a unique, high-risk patient cohort: breast cancer survivors whose cancer treatment was delayed and/or changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 50 women with dual carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ, or invasive breast cancer whose cancer surgery was postponed due to the pandemic. As they awaited delayed surgery or shortly after they received delayed surgery, participants completed questionnaires on psychosocial functioning (depression, anxiety, sleep, and quality of life), their perceived risk and fear of cancer progression, patient-provider communication about disruptions in their care, personal impact of the pandemic, worry/threat about COVID-19, and COVID-19 symptoms/diagnoses. Descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations were computed among continuous study variables. Independent samples t-tests explored group differences in psychosocial functioning between survivors who were still awaiting delayed surgery and those who had recently received it. Results: Overall, the sample denied that the pandemic seriously negatively impacted their finances or resource access and reported low-to-moderate levels of psychosocial distress and fear about COVID-19. Twenty-six percent had clinically significant levels of fear of cancer progression, with levels comparable to other recent work. About a third were still awaiting delayed cancer surgery and this group reported lower satisfaction with communication from oncology providers but overall did not seem to report more psychosocial difficulties than those who already had surgery. Conclusion: Shortly before or after primary breast cancer surgery that was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this sample of survivors appears to be generally managing well psychosocially. However, many psychosocial difficulties (e.g., fear of cancer recurrence/progression) typically have an onset after the completion of treatment, therefore, research should continue to follow this cohort of cancer survivors as the pandemic’s direct impact on their care likely increases their risk for these difficulties later in survivorship.","Soriano, Emily C.; Perndorfer, Christine; Otto, Amy K.; Fenech, Alyssa L.; Siegel, Scott D.; Dickson-Witmer, Diana; Clements, Lydia; Laurenceau, Jean-Philippe",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34194367/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.662339,636

According to first adult studies association of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms with COVID 19 infection was as high as 79% (1).But later study showed lower association around 18% (2).As the pandemic of COVID 19 is going on, different clinical presentation of disease especially in children are well appeared. In addition atypical presentations may confuse and mislead physician to do different diagnostic procedures and interventions. We report a 6 years and half old boy with diarrhea, abdominal pain with first diagnosis acute abdomen due to acute appendicitis. At last diagnosis of pneumatosis intestinalis due to enterocolitis was confirmed. CASE PRESENTATION: A 6 years and half old boy with severe abdominal pain admitted in emergency ward. He had history of fever, nine days of diarrhea and recurrent vomiting. The abdominal pain was severe with moderate tenderness in right lower quadrant. He admitted in pediatric surgery ward after surgical consultation for rolling out acute appendicitis. The results of first lab studies were shown leucopenia, lymphopenia and COVID 19 PCR was positive. During admission the cough has increased and abdominal distention has evolved. Vomiting was intractable and feeding was impossible. Pneumatosis intestinalis in ascending colon and dilatation in colon caliber were detected abdominal. Miliary like pattern in lung has reported in chest CT. Stool exam results revealed loss of protein in high amount in spite of normal pancreatic and enterocyte function. The calprotectin was high and implied high inflammation in large intestine. With all above data necrotizing enterocolitis management was started. After 14 days patients had good appetite and feeding slowly introduced. All symptoms resolved with exception of cough. Albumin and other electrolytes remained stable. The patient discharged without morbidity. CONCLUSION: COVID 19 infection has many different and mysterious presentations. GI manifestations are among important, common presentations. The acute abdomen like presentation with different complications like pneumatosis intestinalis, protein losing enteropathy are not common but knowledge about these presentations assist physician to be aware and make decision accurately.","Rohani, Pejman; Karimi, Abdollah; Tabatabaie, Sedigheh Rafiei; Khalili, Mitra; Sayyari, Aliakbar",J Pediatr Surg Case Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213576620303018; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsc.2020.101667; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213576620303018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173753/,636
611840,Survey Fatigue During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Analysis of Neurosurgery Survey Response Rates,2021-08-12,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to explore the effect of antiretroviral treatment (ART) history on clinical characteristics of patients with co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 20 patients with laboratory-confirmed co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV in a designated hospital. Patients were divided into medicine group (n = 12) and non-medicine group (n = 8) according to previous ART history before SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The median age was 46.5 years and 15 (75%) were female. Ten patients had initial negative RT-PCR on admission, 5 of which had normal CT appearance and 4 were asymptomatic. Lymphocytes were low in 9 patients (45%), CD4 cell count and CD4/CD8 were low in all patients. The predominant CT features in 19 patients were multiple (42%) ground-glass opacities (58%) and consolidations (32%). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in the medicine group was significantly lower than that in the non-medicine group [median (interquartile range, IQR):14.0 (10.0–34.0) vs. 51.0 (35.8–62.0), P = 0.005]. Nineteen patients (95%) were discharged with a median hospital stay of 30 days (IQR, 26–30). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 and HIV co-infection exhibited mild to moderate symptoms. The milder extent of inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection might be associated with a previous history of ART in HIV-infected patients.","Liu, Jia; Zeng, Wenjuan; Cao, Yukun; Cui, Yue; Li, Yumin; Yao, Sheng; Alwalid, Osamah; Yang, Fan; Fan, Yanqing; Shi, Heshui",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.08.045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32829051/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220306743; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220306743?v=s5,636
611910,Go slow to go fast: A plea for sustained scientific rigor in air pollution research during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-06-25,"To prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, colleges and universities have implemented multiple strategies including testing, isolation, quarantine, contact tracing, masking, and vaccination. In April 2021, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) was notified of a large cluster of students with COVID-19 at an urban university after spring break. A total of 158 cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed among undergraduate students during March 15-May 3, 2021; the majority (114; 72.2%) lived in on-campus dormitories. CDPH evaluated the role of travel and social connections, as well as the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants, on transmission. Among 140 infected students who were interviewed, 89 (63.6%) reported recent travel outside Chicago during spring break, and 57 (40.7%) reported indoor social exposures. At the time of the outbreak, undergraduate-aged persons were largely ineligible for vaccination in Chicago; only three of the students with COVID-19 (1.9%) were fully vaccinated. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 104 specimens revealed multiple distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages, suggesting several nearly simultaneous introductions. Most specimens (66; 63.5%) were B.1.1.222, a lineage not widely detected in Chicago before or after this outbreak. These results demonstrate the potential for COVID-19 outbreaks on university campuses after widespread student travel during breaks, at the beginning of new school terms, and when students participate in indoor social gatherings. To prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, colleges and universities should encourage COVID-19 vaccination; discourage unvaccinated students from travel, including during university breaks; implement serial COVID-19 screening among unvaccinated persons after university breaks; encourage masking; and implement universal serial testing for students based on community transmission levels.","Doyle, Kate; Teran, Richard A.; Reefhuis, Jennita; Kerins, Janna L.; Qiu, Xueting; Green, Stefan J.; Choi, Hyeree; Madni, Sabrina A.; Kamal, Nazia; Landon, Emily; Albert, Reynald Christopher; Pacilli, Massimo; Furtado, Laura E.; Hayden, Mary K.; Kunstman, Kevin J.; Bethel, Cindy; Megger, Lauren; Fricchione, Marielle J.; Ghinai, Isaac",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7035a3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34473687/,636

Despite over 50 years of experimental studies, translation of these benchside discoveries into effective biological therapies has been elusive. Recent advances in high throughput biological sampling, imaging and advances in data analytics has allowed studying ARDS in human subjects based on pragmatic studies. In this review, we present some of the key advances made in our knowledge of the pathophysiology of ARDS, based on histopathology, imaging, protein and transcriptomic biomarkers. Finally, we review the role of such human studies in understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19 related ARDS. As the pandemic evolves, it is becoming increasingly clear that our knowledge of the pathophysiological drivers in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS is incomplete. Systematic and large-scale data collection that is multi-dimensional and includes samples from several anatomical compartments and over several timepoints is key to unlocking the great systems biology puzzle that is ARDS.","Sinha, Pratik; Bos, Lieuwe D.",Crit Care Clin,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749070421000439?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0749070421000439; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccc.2021.05.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548134/,636

Many studies have used RT-PCR analysis to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces but seldom has viable virus been detected. This paper investigates the viability over time of SARS-CoV-2 dried onto a range of materials and compares viability of the virus to RNA copies recovered, and whether virus viability is concentration dependant. Viable virus persisted for the longest time on surgical mask material and stainless steel with a 99.9% reduction in viability by 124 and 113 hours respectively. Viability of SARS-CoV-2 reduced the fastest on a polyester shirt, with a 99.9% reduction within 2.5 hours. Viability on cotton was reduced second fastest, with 99.9% reduction in 72 hours. RNA on all the surfaces exhibited a one log reduction in genome copy recovery over 21 days. The findings show that SARS-CoV-2 is most stable on non-porous hydrophobic surfaces. RNA is highly stable when dried on surfaces with only one log reduction in recovery over three weeks. In comparison, SARS-CoV-2 viability reduced more rapidly, but this loss in viability was found to be independent of starting concentration. Expected levels of SARS-CoV-2 viable environmental surface contamination would lead to undetectable levels within two days. Therefore, when RNA is detected on surfaces it does not directly indicate presence of viable virus even at high CT values. Importance This study shows the impact of material type on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces. It demonstrates that the decay rate of viable SARS-CoV-2 is independent of starting concentration. However, RNA shows high stability on surfaces over extended periods. This has implications for interpretation of surface sampling results using RT-PCR to determine the possibility of viable virus from a surface. Unless sampled immediately after contamination it is difficult to align RNA copy numbers to quantity of viable virus on a surface.","Paton, Susan; Spencer, Antony; Garratt, Isobel; Thompson, Katy-Anne; Dinesh, Ikshitaa; Aranega-Bou, Paz; Stevenson, David; Clark, Simon; Dunning, Jake; Bennett, Allan; Pottage, Thomas",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.11.435056,636

Viral entry by ACE-2 receptor and an excessive activation of the immune system are key to understand both incidence and severity of disease. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) represents a special condition associated with an inordinate response of the immune system to external agents. IBD treatments have been associated to an increased risk of bacterial and viral infections. This has raised the question of possible higher incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection in IBD patients. Several papers have been published during this year of pandemic to answer that question. Moreover, COVID-19 vaccination offers great promise in controlling infection in patients with IBD. Based on current evidence, patients with IBD do not have a higher incidence of COVID-19 than the general population, and they do not have worse disease evolution. Advanced age and presence of a greater number of comorbidities have been associated with worse outcomes, similar to the general population. Corticosteroids are associated to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, higher hospitalization rate and higher risk of severe COVID-19. 5-ASA / Sulfasalazine and Thiopurines have a possible increased risk of severe COVID-19, although studies are lacking. On the other hand, Anti-TNF may have a possible protective effect. It is recommended to maintain the treatment. Anti-IL-12/23, anti-integrins and tofacitinib have results comparable to anti-TNF. Based on the efficacy, expert recommendations, and the absence of other evidence, it is recommended that patients with IBD be vaccinated.","Suria, Carles; Bosca-Watts, Marta M; Navarro, Pablo; Tosca, Joan; Anton, Rosario; Sanahuja, Ana; Revaliente, Marta; Miguel Minguez, M",Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S021057052100203X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S021057052100203X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gastrohep.2021.06.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34171421/,636

Viral sequences are searched within ViruSurf, which stores curated metadata and amino acid changes imported from the most widely used deposition sources for viral databases (GenBank, COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) and Global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID)). Epitopes are searched within the open source Immune Epitope Database or directly proposed by users by indicating their start and stop positions in the context of a given viral protein. Amino acid changes of selected populations are joined with epitopes of interest; a result table summarizes, for each epitope, statistics about the overlapping amino acid changes and about the sequences carrying such alterations. The results may also be inspected by the VirusViz Web application; epitope regions are highlighted within the given viral protein, and changes can be comparatively inspected. For sequences mutated within the epitope, we also offer a complete view of the distribution of amino acid changes, optionally grouped by the location, collection date or lineage. Thanks to these functionalities, EpiSurf supports the user-friendly testing of epitope conservancy within selected populations of interest, which can be of utmost relevance for designing vaccines, drugs or serological assays.

A retrospective study was conducted at the International Medical Center (IMC) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to assess features of pediatric patients admitted with COVID-19 from April 2020 to September 2020. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were found to meet the study inclusion criteria. The most common presenting symptom was fever (53.5%) in study participants followed by complaints of cough, runny nose, and shortness of breath (37.2%). Lymphocytopenia was evident among 60% of those studied. Elevated C-Reactive Protein was remarkable in 24.9%. More than half of those (53.5%) studied required only supportive treatment. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 disease for the most part is mild in children with a varying clinical picture and nonspecific laboratory parameters.

This virus, which is called SARS-CoV-2, has infected tens of thousands of people. Based on symptoms, the pathogenesis of acute respiratory illness is responsible for highly homogenous coronaviruses as well as other pathogens. Evidence suggests that high inflammation rates, oxidation, and overwhelming immune response probably contribute to pathology of COVID-19. COVID-19 causes cytokine storm, which subsequently leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), often ending up in the death of patients. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotential stem cells that are recognized via self-renewal capacity, generation of clonal populations, and multilineage differentiation. MSCs are present in nearly all tissues of the body, playing an essential role in repair and generation of tissues. Furthermore, MSCs have broad immunoregulatory properties through the interaction of immune cells in both innate and adaptive immune systems, leading to immunosuppression of many effector activities. MSCs can reduce the cytokine storm produced by coronavirus infection. In a number of studies, the administration of these cells has been beneficial for COVID-19 patients. Also, MSCs may be able to improve pulmonary fibrosis and lung function. In this review, we will review the newest research findings regarding MSC-based immunomodulation in patients with COVID-19.","Kavianpour, Maria; Saleh, Mahshid; Verdi, Javad",Stem Cell Res Ther,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-020-01849-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32948252/,636

Due to the lack of specific drugs against coronavirus, the existing antiviral and antimalarial drugs are currently being administered to the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The scientists are also considering repurposing of some of the existing drugs as a suitable option in search of effective drugs against coronavirus till the establishment of a potent drug and/or vaccine. Computer-aided drug discovery provides a promising attempt to enable scientists to develop new and target specific drugs to combat any disease. The discovery of novel targets for COVID-19 using computer-aided drug discovery tools requires the knowledge of structure of the coronavirus and the various target proteins present in the virus. Targeting the viral proteins will make the drug specific against the virus, thereby, increasing the chances of viral mortality. Hence, this review provides the structure of SARS-CoV-2 virus along with the important viral components involved in causing infection. It also focuses on the role of various target proteins in disease, the mechanism by which currently administered drugs act against the virus and the repurposing of few drugs. The gap arising from the absence of specific drugs is addressed by proposing potential antiviral drug targets which might provide insights into structure-based drug development against SARS-CoV-2.","Yadav, Manisha; Dhagat, Swasti; Eswari, J.

The beneficial effects of tea have been mostly attributed to its catechin content. Black tea is derived from the leaves of Camellia sinensis plant, and it is rich in theaflavin polyphenols, in particular theaflavin (TF1), theaflavin-3-monogallate (TF2A), theaflavin-3′-monogallate (TF2B), and theaflavin-3,3′-digallate (TF3). Vero and A549 cells were used to evaluate the effect of purified individual black tea theaflavins as anti-herpes simplex virus 1 agents. With the rise of HSV resistant strains, there is a critical need to develop novel antiherpesviral treatments. Results of the cytotoxicity assay tested by MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] showed that TF1, TF2, and TF3 are not toxic to Vero and A549 cells at a concentration up to 75 μM. The antiviral activity of the individual theaflavins was tested by plaque reduction assay, MTS assay, flow cytometric analysis and confocal microscopy observations. The results showed that TF1, TF2, and TF3 exhibit potent, dose-dependent anti-HSV-1 effect, with TF3 being the most efficient in both Vero and A549 cells. A concentration of 50 μM TF3 and above was sufficient to inhibit >99% of the production of HSV-1 viral particles. The anti-HSV-1 effect of TF3 is due to a direct effect on the virions, and treating Vero or A549 cells with TF3 for 1 h prior to infection, or treating the cells at different times post infection does not inhibit HSV-1 production. TF3 is stable at vaginal pH, indicating its potential to be a promising natural and affordable remedy against herpes simplex viral infections.","de Oliveira, Aline; Prince, Derek; Lo, Chih-Yu; Lee, Lee H.; Chu, Tin-Chun",Antiviral Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016635421500073X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25818500/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.03.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016635421500073X,636

Restart and recovery processes will be influenced by the need to protect patients and staff from disease transmission, but data on the risk of COVID-19 transmission after endoscopy are sparse. This is of particular importance in later pandemic phases when the risk of harm from delayed or missed significant diagnoses is likely to far outweigh the risk of infection. The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidance for restarting endoscopy included stratification of diagnostic procedures according to aerosol generation or assessment of infectious risk as well as pragmatic guidance on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). We sought to document the risk of COVID-19 transmission after endoscopy in this 'COVID-minimised' environment. Prospective data were collected from 18 UK centres for n=6208 procedures, with follow-up telephone assessment of patients at 7 and 14 days. No cases of COVID-19 were documented by any centre after endoscopy in either patients or staff, with 3/2611 (0.11%) asymptomatic patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab testing pre-endoscopy. While these data cannot determine the relative contribution of each component of a COVID-minimised pathway, they provide clear support for such an approach, are reassuring and should aid planning for outpatient diagnostics in the COVID-19 recovery phase.","Hayee, B.; The SCOTS project group,; East, J.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective assessment was performed to the response and management strategy developed to transform the clinical and academic enterprise. SETTING: Large urban tertiary care referral center. RESULTS: The departmental structure was reorganized along new clinical teams to effectively meet the system directives for provision of otolaryngology care and support for inpatient cases of COVID-19. A surge deployment schedule was developed to assist frontline colleagues with clinical support as needed. Outpatient otolaryngology was consolidated across the system with conversion of the majority of visits to telehealth. Operative procedures were prioritized to ensure throughput for emergent and time-critical urgent procedures. A tracheostomy protocol was developed to guide management of emergent and elective airways. Educational and research efforts were redirected to focus on otolaryngology care in the clinical context of the COVID-19 crisis. CONCLUSION: Emergence of the COVID-19 global health crisis has challenged delivery of otolaryngology care in an unparalleled manner. The concerns for preserving health of the workforce while ethically addressing patient career needs in a timely manner has created significant dilemmas. A proactive, thoughtful approach that reorganizes the overall departmental effort through provider and staff engagement can facilitate the ability to meet the needs of otolaryngology patients and to support the greater institutional mission to combat the pandemic.","Batra, Pete S.; LoSavio, Phillip S.; Michaelides, Elias; Revenaugh, Peter C.; Tajudeen, Bobby A.; Al-khudari, Samer; Husain, Inna; Papagiannopoulos, Peter; Smith, Ryan; Stenson, Kerstin M.; Wiet, R.

In response to different viral infections, NK cells fight viruses in different ways, and different NK subsets proliferate. For instance, cytomegalovirus (CMV) induces NKG2C + CD57 + KIR+ NK cells to expand 3–6 months after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), but human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) induces KIR3DS1+/KIR3DL1 NK cells to expand in the acute phase of infection. However, the similarities and differences among these processes and their molecular mechanisms have not been fully discussed. In this article, we provide a summary and comparison of antiviral mechanisms, unique subset expansion and time periods in peripheral blood and tissues under different conditions of CMV, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), COVID-19 and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections.

A less invasive and possibly self-administered sampling method may increase the capacity for testing and be more effective in identifying, isolating, and filtering out currently infected persons. Methods: Over a period of three months, we included volunteers presenting with recent symptoms suggestive of a SARS-CoV-2 infection at a free COVID-19 screening center in the city of Nice, France. NPS as well as nasal and oral sponges were collected in parallel and analyzed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Results: One hundred and forty-seven subjects were included, of whom, 41.5% were diag-nosed with COVID-19 using NPS RT-PCR. RT-PCR on nasal and oral sponges showed a sensitivity of 87 to 98% and 72 to 87%, respectively for diagnosis of COVID-19 in symptomat-ic subjects, depending on the type of RT-PCR technique used. The specificity was 100% whatever the RT-PCR test. The viral load determined with the oral samples was significantly lower than with NPS. Conclusion: Taken together, these results demonstrated that the oral sponge sampling method can be standardized, is easy to use and cheap. The acceptability makes it a repeata-ble test, notably for elderly people or children. It may become a high-frequency - low analyti-cal sensitive testing strategy.","MARQUETTE, C.

Immunomodulatory treatments like tocilizumab were found to improve inflammatory markers and lung injury over time. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of tocilizumab treatment on critically ill patients with severe COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a multi-center retrospective cohort study of 154 adult patients admitted to the ICU for severe COVID-19 pneumonia between March 15 and May 8, 2020. Data were obtained by electronic medical record (EMR) review. The primary outcome of interest was mortality. RESULTS Of 154 patients, 34 (21.4%) received tocilizumab. Compared to the non-treated group, the treated group was significantly younger, had fewer comorbidities, lower creatinine and procalcitonin levels, and higher alanine aminotransferase levels on admission. The treated group was more likely to receive supportive measures in the context of critical illness. The overall case fatality rate was 71.4%, and it was significantly lower in the treated than the non-treated (52.9 vs. 76.7%, p = 0.007). In multivariable survival analysis, tocilizumab treatment was associated with a 2.1 times lower hazard of mortality when compared to those who were not treated (hazard ratio: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.83; p = 0.009).

This study examined the mechanism underlying this phenomenon by measuring the expression of antiviral genes—tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and GTPase myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1)—in G6PD-knockdown cells upon human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection. Molecular analysis revealed that the promoter activities of TNF-α and MX1 were downregulated in G6PD-knockdown cells, and that the IκB degradation and DNA binding activity of NF-κB were decreased. The HSCARG protein, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) sensor and negative regulator of NF-κB, was upregulated in G6PD-knockdown cells with decreased NADPH/NADP(+) ratio. Treatment of G6PD-knockdown cells with siRNA against HSCARG enhanced the DNA binding activity of NF-κB and the expression of TNF-α and MX1, but suppressed the expression of viral genes; however, the overexpression of HSCARG inhibited the antiviral response. Exogenous G6PD or IDH1 expression inhibited the expression of HSCARG, resulting in increased expression of TNF-α and MX1 and reduced viral gene expression upon virus infection. Our findings suggest that the increased susceptibility of the G6PD-knockdown cells to viral infection was due to impaired NF-κB signaling and antiviral response mediated by HSCARG.","Wu, Yi-Hsuan; Chiu, Daniel Tsun-Yee; Lin, Hsin-Ru; Tang, Hsiang-Yu; Cheng, Mei-Ling; Ho, Hung-Yao",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v7122966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26694452/,636

Measures included demographics, comorbid diseases, and routine laboratory tests. RESULTS: A total of 4901 patients with COVID‐19 were included: mean age was 56, 48% female, 42% obese, 38% White, 40% Black, cardiac disease 15%, diabetes mellitus (DM) 39%, liver disease 20%, and respiratory disease 50%. Need for MV was 6%. The optimal cutoff FIB‐4 for need for mechanical ventilation was 3.04 (AUC 0.735) which had a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 42%, 77%, 11%, and 95%, respectively with 93% accuracy. When stratified by race, increased FIB‐4 remained associated with need for mechanical ventilation in both Whites and Blacks. CONCLUSIONS: FIB‐4 can be used by front line providers to identify which patients may require MV.","Sterling, Richard K.; Shin, Dongho; Shin, Yongyun; French, Evan; Stevens, Michael P.; Bajaj, Jasmohan S.; DeWit, Marjolein; Sanyal, Arun J.",Hepatol Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34222739/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hep4.1737,636
625331,COVID-19 and lockdown: Delayed effects on health,2020-05-15,"Introduction Medical schools in the United Kingdom are under increasing pressure to provide more streamlined, applicable teaching due to rising numbers of trainee doctors but are failing to meet their educational need for otolaryngology. The recent novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed additional pressures on medical schools to adapt the medium over which the curriculum is delivered. The use of tactile learning with three-dimensional models and distanced learning via videoconferencing may provide alternative teaching methods to meet otolaryngology undergraduate learning requirements. This pilot study aimed to assess the differences in undergraduate student attitudes toward tactile learning via nontactile distanced learning and review their acceptability among this cohort. Methods Two groups of medical students observed a single educational event on the larynx and management of the airway. The learning opportunity was delivered in a lecture format with the lecturer demonstrating on an anatomical model of the larynx. Group one (tactile group) had an identical model to interact with during the lecture and were present within the lecture theater; group two (nontactile group) did not and observed the lecture via video link. Students were asked to rank their opinion to several statements about the session based on an 11-point Likert's scale and give qualitative feedback. Results All ranked feedback was mainly positive. Tactile learning was statistically equivalent to nontactile learning based on the ranked feedback from the students, except for “improvement in anatomical knowledge,” for which the students believed tactile learning was superior ( p = 0.017). A variety of qualitative feedback was received by both groups. Conclusion This pilot study provides evidence for the acceptability among students of the use of nontactile distanced learning to deliver the otolaryngology undergraduate curriculum compared with tactile learning. This can provide the basis for larger studies to assess the educational impact of these different teaching methods.","Pandya, Aashish; Mistry, Dylan; Owens, David",Surg J (N Y),https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1733992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34541319/,636

625948,Psychiatry in the age of COVID-19,2020,"Human astroviruses (HAstVs) are a major cause of gastroenteritis. HAstV assembles from the structural protein VP90 and undergoes a cascade of proteolytic cleavages. Cleavage to VP70 is required for release of immature particles from cells, and subsequent cleavage by trypsin confers infectivity. We used electron cryomicroscopy and icosahedral image analysis to determine the first experimentally derived, three-dimensional structures of an immature VP70 virion and a fully proteolyzed, infectious virion. Both particles display T = 3 icosahedral symmetry and nearly identical solid capsid shells with diameters of ~ 350 Å. Globular spikes emanate from the capsid surface, yielding an overall diameter of ~ 440 Å. While the immature particles display 90 dimeric spikes, the mature capsid only displays 30 spikes, located on the icosahedral 2-fold axes. Loss of the 60 peripentonal spikes likely plays an important role in viral infectivity. In addition, immature HAstV bears a striking resemblance to the structure of hepatitis E virus (HEV)-like particles, as previously predicted from structural similarity of the crystal structure of the astrovirus spike domain with the HEV P-domain [Dong, J., Dong, L., Méndez, E. & Tao, Y. (2011). Crystal structure of the human astrovirus capsid spike. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA108, 12681–12686]. Similarities between their capsid shells and dimeric spikes and between the sequences of their capsid proteins suggest that these viral families are phylogenetically related and may share common assembly and activation mechanisms.","Dryden, Kelly A.; Tihova, Mariana; Nowotny, Norbert; Matsui, Suzanne M.; Mendez, Ernesto; Yeager, Mark",J Mol Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283612005025; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2012.06.029; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283612005025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22743104/,636
626693,High‐power laser and its implications in covid‐19 season,2020-12-16,"BACKGROUND: Acute chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity is characterized by a combination of direct cardiovascular effects and electrolyte derangements with resultant dysrhythmias and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: This review describes acute chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity, outlines the complex pathophysiologic derangements, and addresses the emergency department (ED) management of this patient population. DISCUSSION: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are aminoquinoline derivatives widely used in the treatment of rheumatologic diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis as well as for malaria prophylaxis. In early 2020, anecdotal reports and preliminary data suggested utility of hydroxychloroquine in attenuating viral loads and symptoms in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Aminoquinoline drugs pose unique and significant toxicological risks, both during their intended use as well as in unsupervised settings by laypersons. The therapeutic range for chloroquine is narrow. Acute severe toxicity is associated with 10–30% mortality owing to a combination of direct cardiovascular effects and electrolyte derangements with resultant dysrhythmias. Treatment in the ED is focused on decontamination, stabilization of cardiac dysrhythmias, hemodynamic support, electrolyte correction, and seizure prevention. CONCLUSIONS: An understanding of the pathophysiology of acute chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity and available emergency treatments can assist emergency clinicians in reducing the immediate morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.","Porta, Alessandra Della; Bornstein, Kasha; Coye, Austin; Montrief, Tim; Long, Brit; Parris, Mehruba Anwar",Am J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.07.030; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720306252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071096/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720306252?v=s5,636
626923,Propensity of aerosol and droplet creation during oculoplastic procedures: A risk assessment with high-speed imaging amidst COVID-19 pandemic,2021-02-17,"OBJECTIVES: Despite an estimated 300 000 mobile health apps on the market, there remains no consensus around helping patients and clinicians select safe and effective apps. In 2018, our team drew on existing evaluation frameworks to identify salient categories and create a new framework endorsed by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). We have since created a more expanded and operational framework Mhealth Index and Navigation Database (MIND) that aligns with the APA categories but includes objective and auditable questions (105). We sought to survey the existing space, conducting a review of all mobile health app evaluation frameworks published since 2018, and demonstrate the comprehensiveness of this new model by comparing it to existing and emerging frameworks. DESIGN: We conducted a scoping review of mobile health app evaluation frameworks. DATA SOURCES: References were identified through searches of PubMed, EMBASE and PsychINFO with publication date between January 2018 and October 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Papers were selected for inclusion if they meet the predetermined eligibility criteria—presenting an evaluation framework for mobile health apps with patient, clinician or end user-facing questions. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers screened the literature separately and applied the inclusion criteria. The data extracted from the papers included: author and dates of publication, source affiliation, country of origin, name of framework, study design, description of framework, intended audience/user and framework scoring system. We then compiled a collection of more than 1701 questions across 79 frameworks. We compared and grouped these questions using the MIND framework as a reference. We sought to identify the most common domains of evaluation while assessing the comprehensiveness and flexibility—as well as any potential gaps—of MIND. RESULTS: New app evaluation frameworks continue to emerge and expand. Since our 2019 review of the app evaluation framework space, more frameworks include questions around privacy (43) and clinical foundation (57), reflecting an increased focus on issues of app security and evidence base. The majority of mapped frameworks overlapped with at least half of the MIND categories. The results of this search have informed a database (apps.digitalpsych.org) that users can access today. CONCLUSION: As the number of app evaluation frameworks continues to rise, it is becoming difficult for users to select both an appropriate evaluation tool and to find an appropriate health app. This review provides a comparison of what different app evaluation frameworks are offering, where the field is converging and new priorities for improving clinical guidance.","Lagan, Sarah; Sandler, Lev; Torous, John",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33741674/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047001,636
626942,Disease Burden Attributable to the First Wave of COVID-19 in China and the Effect of Timing on the Cost-Effectiveness of Movement Restriction Policies,2021-02-21,"BACKGROUND: The WHO’s Research and Development Blueprint priority list designates emerging diseases with the potential to generate public health emergencies for which insufficient preventive solutions exist. The list aims to reduce the time to the availability of resources that can avert public health crises. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic illustrates that an effective method of mitigating such crises is the pre-emptive prediction of outbreaks. This scoping review thus aimed to map and identify the evidence available to predict future outbreaks of the Blueprint diseases. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of PubMed, Embase and Web of Science related to the evidence predicting future outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg virus, Zika virus, Lassa fever, Nipah and Henipaviral disease, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome and Disease X. Prediction methods, outbreak features predicted and implementation of predictions were evaluated. We conducted a narrative and quantitative evidence synthesis to highlight prediction methods that could be further investigated for the prevention of Blueprint diseases and COVID-19 outbreaks. RESULTS: Out of 3959 articles identified, we included 58 articles based on inclusion criteria. 5 major prediction methods emerged; the most frequent being spatio-temporal risk maps predicting outbreak risk periods and locations through vector and climate data. Stochastic models were predominant. Rift Valley fever was the most predicted disease. Diseases with complex sociocultural factors such as Ebola were often predicted through multifactorial risk-based estimations. 10% of models were implemented by health authorities. No article predicted Disease X outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: Spatiotemporal models for diseases with strong climatic and vectorial components, as in River Valley fever prediction, may currently best reduce the time to the availability of resources. A wide literature gap exists in the prediction of zoonoses with complex sociocultural and ecological dynamics such as Ebola, COVID-19 and especially Disease X.","Jonkmans, Nils; D’Acremont, Valérie; Flahault, Antoine",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-006623; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34531189/,636

METHODS: The study included 2 separate groups. The first one consisted of 96 positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Covid-19 patients and the second one of 106 patients with negative PCR but positive chest computed tomography (CT) findings consistent with Covid-19. We measured QTmax, QTmin, QRS, JT and Tp-e intervals and estimated Tp-e/QT max, Tp- e/QTc max, Tp-e/JT and Tp-e/JTc rates and QTc max, QTc min, cQTd and JTc intervals. RESULTS: QT max, QT min, JT, cQTd, Tp-e, Tp-e/QT max, Tp-e/QTc max, Tp-e/JT, Tp-e/JTc values were significantly higher in RT-PCR Covid-19 patient group.

Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes respiratory infection by binding to ACE2 receptors present on alveolar epithelial cells, studies have been published linking the disease to the small intestine enterocytes and its microbiome. Dysbiosis of microbiome, mainly intestinal and lung, can affect the course of the disease. Environmental factors, such as reduced intake of commensal bacteria from the environment or their products in the diet, play an important role in microbiome formation, which can significantly affect the immune response. In elderly, obese or chronically ill people, the microbiota is often damaged. Therefore, we speculate that a good microbiome may be one of the factors responsible for lower CFR from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). An approach using tailored nutrition and supplements known to improve the intestinal microbiota and its immune function might help minimize the impact of the disease at least on people at higher risk from coronavirus.","Janda, Lubomír; Mihalčin, Matúš; Šťastná, Michaela",Biologia (Bratisl),https://doi.org/10.2478/s11756-020-00614-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33078028/,636

However, knowledge concerning long-term kinetics of antibody responses in convalescent patients is limited. During a one-year period post symptom onset, we longitudinally collected 162 samples from 76 patients and quantified IgM and IgG antibodies recognizing the nucleocapsid (N) protein or the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S). After one year, approximately 90% of recovered patients still had detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies recognizing N and RBD-S. Intriguingly, neutralizing activity was only detectable in ~43% of patients. When neutralization tests against the E484K-mutated variant of concern (VOC) B.1.351 (initially identified in South Africa) were performed among patients who neutralize the original virus, the capacity to neutralize was even further diminished to 22.6% of donors. Despite declining N- and S-specific IgG titers, a considerable fraction of recovered patients had detectable neutralizing activity one year after infection. However, neutralizing capacities, in particular against an E484K-mutated VOC were only detectable in a minority of patients one year after symptomatic COVID-19. Our findings shed light on the kinetics of long-term immune responses after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and argue for vaccinations of individuals who experienced a natural infection to protect against emerging VOC.","Xiang, Tiandan; Liang, Boyun; Fang, Yaohui; Lu, Sihong; Li, Sumeng; Wang, Hua; Li, Huadong; Yang, Xiaoli; Shen, Shu; Zhu, Bin; Wang, Baoju; Wu, Jun; Liu, Jia; Lu, Mengji; Yang, Dongliang; Dittmer, Ulf; Trilling, Mirko; Deng, Fei; Zheng, Xin",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.708523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34220870/,636
627837,The impact of leadership on the nursing workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-05-19,"We previously developed a respiratory tract vaccine against Ebola virus (EBOV) based on human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), a respiratory paramyxovirus, expressing the EBOV GP envelope protein (HPIV3/GP) from an added gene. Two doses of this vaccine delivered by the intranasal and intratracheal route protected monkeys against intraperitoneal challenge with EBOV; however, concerns exist that the vaccine may have reduced immunogenicity in the adult human population due to pre-existing immunity against HPIV3. Here we developed a new vaccine (NDV/GP) based on Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus that is antigenically distinct from human viral pathogens and is highly attenuated in monkeys. Following one intranasal and intratracheal inoculation of Rhesus monkeys with NDV/GP, titers of EBOV-specific antibodies in respiratory tract secretions and serum samples determined by ELISA, as well as serum EBOV-neutralizing antibodies, were undetectable or low compared to those induced by HPIV3/GP. A second immunization resulted in a substantial boost in serum IgG ELISA titers, yet the titers remained lower than those induced by a second dose of HPIV3/GP. In contrast, the ELISA IgA titers in respiratory tract secretions and, more importantly, the serum EBOV-neutralizing antibody titers were equal to those induced after the second dose of HPIV3/GP. These data suggest that NDV/GP can be effective for immunization against EBOV alone, or in combination with either HPIV3/GP or another vaccine platform in a heterologous prime-boost regimen.","DiNapoli, Joshua M.; Yang, Lijuan; Samal, Siba K.; Murphy, Brian R.; Collins, Peter L.; Bukreyev, Alexander",Vaccine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X10014933; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3428043?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21034822/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.10.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X10014933,636

628029,Impact of COVID-19 and ICU capacity on vaccination support: Evidence from a two-leg representative survey in the UK,2021-05-17,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a membrane-bound zinc metallopeptidase that generates the vasodilatory peptide angiotensin 1–7 and thus performs a protective role in heart disease. It is considered an important therapeutic target in controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, since SARS-CoV-2 enters permissive cells via an ACE2-mediated mechanism. The present in silico study attempted to repurpose existing drugs for use as prospective viral-entry inhibitors targeting human ACE2. Initially, a clinically approved drug library of 7,173 ligands was screened against the receptor using molecular docking, followed by energy minimization and rescoring of docked ligands. Finally, potential binders were inspected to ensure molecules with different scaffolds were engaged in favorable contacts with both the metal cofactor and the critical residues lining the receptor’s active site. The results of the calculations suggest that lividomycin, burixafor, quisinostat, fluprofylline, pemetrexed, spirofylline, edotecarin, and diniprofylline emerge as promising repositionable drug candidates for stabilizing the closed (substrate/inhibitor-bound) conformation of ACE2, thereby shifting the relative positions of the receptor’s critical exterior residues recognized by SARS-CoV-2. This study is among the rare ones in the relevant scientific literature to search for potential ACE2 inhibitors. In practical terms, the drugs, unmodified as they are, may be introduced into the therapeutic armamentarium of the ongoing fight against COVID-19 now, or their scaffolds may serve as rich skeletons for designing novel ACE2 inhibitors in the near future.","Teralı, Kerem; Baddal, Buket; Gülcan, Hayrettin Ozan",J Mol Graph Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32739642/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1093326320304861; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmgm.2020.107697; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1093326320304861?v=s5,636

METHODS A total of 118 fourth-year medical students participated in this study. The participants were divided into two groups: the online synchronous teaching group and the face-to-face group. Then, the participants were further randomly distributed to 1 of 2 feedback groups: online synchronous teaching and training with feedback devices (TF, n = 30) or without feedback devices (TN, n = 29) and face-to-face teaching and training with feedback devices (FF, n = 30) or without feedback devices (FN, n = 29). In the FN group and FF group, instructors delivered a 45-min CPR training program and gave feedback and guidance during training on site. In the TN group and TF group, the participants were trained with an online lecture via Tencent Meeting live broadcasting. Finally, participants performed a 2-min continuous chest compression (CC) during a simulated cardiopulmonary arrest scene without the audiovisual feedback (AVF) device. The outcome measures included CC depth, CC rate, proportions of appropriate depth (50-60 mm) and CC rate (100-120/min), percentage of correct hand location position, and percentage of complete chest recoil. RESULTS There was little difference in the CC quality between the synchronous online training groups and the face-to-face training groups. There was no statistically significant difference in CC quality between the TN group and FN group. There were also no statistically significant differences between the TF and FF groups in terms of correct hand position, CC depth, appropriate CC depth, complete chest recoil or CC rate. However, the FF group had a higher appropriate CC rate than the TF group (p = 0.045). In the face-to-face training groups, the AVF device group had a significantly greater CC depth, appropriate CC depth, CC rate, and appropriate CC rate. However, there was a lack of statistically significant differences in terms of correct hand position (p = 0.191) and appropriate CC depth (p = 0.123). In the synchronous online training groups, the AVF device had little effect on the CC rate (p = 0.851) and increased the appropriate CC rate, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.178). CONCLUSIONS Synchronous online training with an AVF device would be a potential alternative approach to face-to-face chest compression training. Synchronous online training with AVF devices seems to be a suitable replacement for face-to-face training to offer adequate bystander CPR chest compression training.","Lin, Lian; Ni, Shaozhou; Cheng, Jin; Zhang, Zhongxiang; Zeng, Rong; Jin, Xiaoqing; Zhao, Yan",The American journal of emergency medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34314941/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.07.009,636
628129,Impact of face masks in public spaces during COVID‐19 pandemic on daily life communication of cochlear implant users,2021-05-06,"Abstract Several neurotropic viruses enter the brain after peripheral inoculation and spread transneuronally along pathways known to be connected to the initial site of entry. In this study, the pathways utilized by two such viruses, herpes simplex virus type 1 and mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM, were compared using in situ hybridization following inoculation into either the nasal cavity or the main olfactory bulb of the mouse. The results indicate that both viruses spread to infect a unique and only partially overlapping set of connections of the main olfactory bulb. Both quantitative and qualitative differences were observed in the patterns of infection of known primary and secondary main olfactory bulb connections. Using immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase combined with in situ hybridization, it was shown that only herpes simplex virus infected noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. In contrast, both viruses infected dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, although mouse hepatitis virus produced a more widespread infection in the A10 group, as well as infecting A8 and A9. The results suggest that differential virus uptake in specific neurotransmitter systems contributes to the pattern of viral spread, although other factors, such as differences in access to particular synapses on infected cells and differences in the distribution of the cellular receptor for the two viruses, are also likely to be important. The data show that neural tracing with different viruses may define unique neural pathways from a site of inoculation. The data also demonstrate that two viruses can enter the brain via the olfactory system and localize to different structures, suggesting that neurological diseases involving disparate regions of the brain could be caused by different viruses, even if entry occurred at a common site.","Barnett, E.

Two independent lung protein interactome were constructed to reveal the signaling process on receptor activation and host protein hijacking machinery in the pathogenesis of virus. Further, we test the functional role of the hubs derived from the interactome. Most hubs proteins were differentially regulated on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, the proteins in viral replication hubs were related with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection in the risk individual. Additionally, the hub proteins were closely linked with other viral infection, including MERS and HCoVs which suggest similar infection pattern in SARS-CoV-2.

With the spread of the virus, the global epidemic situation has become extremely serious, especially in the United States, Spain and Italy. Due to a series of control measures, the epidemic situation in Wuhan has been alleviated to a certain extent, and this region has entered into a post-epidemic period. The treatment of some acute and worsened cardiovascular diseases has become more complex because of epidemic prevention measures. Patients and Methods We examined cardiovascular patients in the emergency department, as well as outpatient clinics and inpatient units in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, from March 20th to April 17th, 2020, as the study subjects, and we performed standard medical activities according to the principles of border treatment and border protection. Additionally, we aimed to minimize the adverse effects of the epidemic on the therapy that was administered to cardiology patients. Results Due to this standard and feasible strategy, the cardiology department admitted a total of 97 patients, with 36 patients being discharged. No patients have been observed to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the cardiology department. In addition, we have no outpatient, caregivers or medical staff infected. Conclusion Our study aimed to provide prevention and treatment strategies for the rapid and effective medical recovery of patients in non-COVID-19 designated hospitals in high-risk areas after remission, as well as in low- and medium-risk areas.","Fan, Qian; Chen, Xin; Lin, Yan; Wang, Zhiquan",Risk management and healthcare policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32801972/; https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s261533; https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=60197,636
629143,The COVID-19 Pandemic and Psychosocial Outcomes across Age through the Stress and Coping Framework,2020-12-15,"Messenger RNA encoded signals that are involved in programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) are typically two-stemmed hairpin (H)-type pseudoknots (pks). We previously described an unusual three-stemmed pseudoknot from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) that stimulated -1 PRF. The conserved existence of a third stem–loop suggested an important hitherto unknown function. Here we present new information describing structure and function of the third stem of the SARS pseudoknot. We uncovered RNA dimerization through a palindromic sequence embedded in the SARS-CoV Stem 3. Further in vitro analysis revealed that SARS-CoV RNA dimers assemble through ‘kissing’ loop–loop interactions. We also show that loop–loop kissing complex formation becomes more efficient at physiological temperature and in the presence of magnesium. When the palindromic sequence was mutated, in vitro RNA dimerization was abolished, and frameshifting was reduced from 15 to 5.7%. Furthermore, the inability to dimerize caused by the silent codon change in Stem 3 of SARS-CoV changed the viral growth kinetics and affected the levels of genomic and subgenomic RNA in infected cells. These results suggest that the homodimeric RNA complex formed by the SARS pseudoknot occurs in the cellular environment and that loop–loop kissing interactions involving Stem 3 modulate -1 PRF and play a role in subgenomic and full-length RNA synthesis.","Ishimaru, Daniella; Plant, Ewan P.; Sims, Amy C.; Yount, Boyd L.; Roth, Braden M.; Eldho, Nadukkudy V.; Pérez-Alvarado, Gabriela C.; Armbruster, David W.; Baric, Ralph S.; Dinman, Jonathan D.; Taylor, Deborah R.; Hennig, Mirko",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23275571/; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gks1361,636

Dysfunction of endothelial cells is believed to mediate a variety of viral infections, including those caused by previous coronaviruses. Experience from previous coronaviruses has triggered hypotheses on the role of endothelial dysfunction in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which are currently being tested in preclinical and clinical studies.

Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are prone to both thrombosis and bleeding, calling for special care during COVID-19. We reviewed the clinical features of MPN patients with COVID-19, suggesting guidance for treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: One study by the European LeukemiaNet collected 175 MPN patients with COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic, from February to May 2020. Patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) were at higher risk of mortality (48%) in comparison with essential thrombocythemia (ET) (25%) and polycythemia vera (19%); the risk of death was higher in those patients who abruptly discontinued ruxolitinib. In patients followed at home, in regular wards, or in ICU, the thrombosis rate was 1.0%, 2.8%, and 18.4%, respectively. Independent risk factors for thrombosis were ET phenotype, transfer to ICU, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio; major bleeding occurred in 4.3% of patients, particularly those with PMF. SUMMARY: MPN patients with non-severe COVID-19 treated at home should continue their primary or secondary antithrombotic prophylaxis with aspirin or oral anticoagulants. In the case of hospitalization, patients assuming aspirin should add low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at standard doses. In contrast, LMWH at intermediate/therapeutic doses should replace oral anticoagulants prescribed for atrial fibrillation or previous venous thromboembolism. Intermediate/high doses of LMWH can also be considered in ICU patients with ET, particularly in the case of a rapid decline in the number of platelets and progressive respiratory failure.","Barbui, Tiziano; De Stefano, Valerio",Curr Hematol Malig Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34586561/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11899-021-00647-z,636

632742,Shanghai Zhongshan Experience on Digestive Endoscopic Procedures During 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-05-15,"BACKGROUND: Substantial progress has been made in reducing the burden of malaria in Africa since 2000, but those gains could be jeopardised if the COVID-19 pandemic affects the availability of key malaria control interventions. The aim of this study was to evaluate plausible effects on malaria incidence and mortality under different levels of disruption to malaria control. METHODS: Using an established set of spatiotemporal Bayesian geostatistical models, we generated geospatial estimates across malaria-endemic African countries of the clinical case incidence and mortality of malaria, incorporating an updated database of parasite rate surveys, insecticide-treated net (ITN) coverage, and effective treatment rates. We established a baseline estimate for the anticipated malaria burden in Africa in the absence of COVID-19-related disruptions, and repeated the analysis for nine hypothetical scenarios in which effective treatment with an antimalarial drug and distribution of ITNs (both through routine channels and mass campaigns) were reduced to varying extents. FINDINGS: We estimated 215·2 (95% uncertainty interval 143·7–311·6) million cases and 386·4 (307·8–497·8) thousand deaths across malaria-endemic African countries in 2020 in our baseline scenario of undisrupted intervention coverage. With greater reductions in access to effective antimalarial drug treatment, our model predicted increasing numbers of cases and deaths: 224·1 (148·7–326·8) million cases and 487·9 (385·3–634·6) thousand deaths with a 25% reduction in antimalarial drug coverage; 233·1 (153·7–342·5) million cases and 597·4 (468·0–784·4) thousand deaths with a 50% reduction; and 242·3 (158·7–358·8) million cases and 715·2 (556·4–947·9) thousand deaths with a 75% reduction. Halting planned 2020 ITN mass distribution campaigns and reducing routine ITN distributions by 25%–75% also increased malaria burden to a total of 230·5 (151·6–343·3) million cases and 411·7 (322·8–545·5) thousand deaths with a 25% reduction; 232·8 (152·3–345·9) million cases and 415·5 (324·3–549·4) thousand deaths with a 50% reduction; and 234·0 (152·9–348·4) million cases and 417·6 (325·5–553·1) thousand deaths with a 75% reduction. When ITN coverage and antimalarial drug coverage were synchronously reduced, malaria burden increased to 240·5 (156·5–358·2) million cases and 520·9 (404·1–691·9) thousand deaths with a 25% reduction; 251·0 (162·2–377·0) million cases and 640·2 (492·0–856·7) thousand deaths with a 50% reduction; and 261·6 (167·7–396·8) million cases and 768·6 (586·1–1038·7) thousand deaths with a 75% reduction. INTERPRETATION: Under pessimistic scenarios, COVID-19-related disruption to malaria control in Africa could almost double malaria mortality in 2020, and potentially lead to even greater increases in subsequent years. To avoid a reversal of two decades of progress against malaria, averting this public health disaster must remain an integrated priority alongside the response to COVID-19.

Viral clearance is the most important laboratory test for defining the recovery of COVID‐19 infections. To better understand which underlying diseases that are risk factors for delaying the viral clearance, we retrospectively analyzed 161 COVID‐19 clinical cases in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China between January 5 and March 13, 2020. The demographic, clinical and laboratory data, as well as patient treatment records were collected. Univariable and multivariable analysis were performed to explore the association between delayed viral clearance and other factors by using logistic regression. Survival analyses by Kaplan‐Meier and Cox regression modeling were employed to identify factors negatively influencing the viral clearance negatively. We found that hypertension and intravenous immunoglobulin adversely affected the time of viral RNA shedding. Hypertension was the most important risk factor to delay the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus clearance, however, the use of Angiotensin‐Converting Enzyme Inhibitors(ACEI)/Angiotensin Receptor Blockers(ARB) did not shorten the time for virus clearance in these hypertensive patients’ virus clearance. We conclude that patients having hypertension and intravenous immunoglobulin may delay the viral clearance in COVID‐19 patients.","Chen, Xiaoping; Hu MT, Wenjia; Yang, Miao; Ling, Jiaxin; Zhang, Yongxi; Deng, Liping; Li, Jinlin; Lundkvist, Åke; Lindahl, Johanna F; Xiong, Yong",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),https://doi.org/10.1111/jch.14308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34171164/,636

METHODS: The study was based on a telephone, one-topic population survey (n=2,014) on willingness to be vaccinated (before the approval of a COVID-19 vaccine in Germany in November/December 2020). RESULTS: The willingness to be vaccinated was about 67% and increased with the proportion of peers and acquaintances who were willing to be vaccinated and had trust in the Robert Koch Institute; willingness was higher in members of a risk group, and in cases where there was an expectation of dangerous consequences of an infection. Experience with infection among the respondents or in peer-groups increased the willingness to be vaccinated. Men had a higher willingness to be vaccinated. The willingness to be vaccinated increased consistently with the level of formal education (with the exception of people with a technical college entrance qualification). Overestimating the likelihood of severe side effects of influenza vaccinations reduced the willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Findings of considerable overestimations of the frequency of serious vaccination side effects were striking. CONCLUSION: Implications for a target group-appropriate information campaign and risk communication are derived. Efforts to promote the willingness of the population to be vaccinated should focus in particular on disadvantaged population groups.","Haug, Sonja; Schnell, Rainer; Weber, Karsten",Gesundheitswesen,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1538-6069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34348412/,636

This study aimed to predict the development of the epidemic with specific interventional policies applied in China and evaluate their effectiveness. METHODS: COVID‐19 data of Hubei Province and the next five most affected provinces were collected from daily case reports of COVID‐19 on the Health Committee official website of these provinces. The number of current cases, defined as the number of confirmed cases minus the number of cured cases and those who have died, was examined in this study. A modified Susceptible‐Exposed‐Infectious‐ Removed (SEIR) model was used to assess the effects of interventional policies on the epidemic. In this study, January 28 was day zero of the model. RESULTS: The results of the modified SEIR model showed that the number of current cases in Hubei and Zhejiang provinces tended to be stabilized after 70 days and after 60 days in the four other provinces. The predicted number of current cases without policy intervention was shown to far exceed that with policy intervention. The estimated number of COVID‐19 cases in Hubei Province with policy intervention was predicted to peak at 51,222, whereas that without policy intervention was predicted to reach 157,721. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the model, strong interventional policies were found to be vital components of epidemic control. Applying such policies is likely to shorten the duration of the epidemic and reduce the number of new cases. This article is protected by copyright.

Washing hands, together with other preventive measures, to be considered one of the most important measures to prevent the disease. This study aimed to characterize reported handwashing practices of Vietnamese people during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated factors. Kobo Toolbox platform was used to design the online survey. There were 837 people participating in this survey. All independent variables were described by calculating frequencies and percentages. Univariate linear regression was used with a significant level of 0.05. Multiple linear regression was conducted to provide a theoretical model with collected predictors. Seventy-nine percent of the respondents used soap as the primary choice when washing their hands. Sixty percent of the participants washed their hands at all essential times, however, only 26.3% practiced washing their hands correctly, and only 28.4% washed their hands for at least 20 seconds. Although 92.1% washed hands after contacting with surfaces at public places (e.g., lifts, knob doors), only 66.3% practiced handwashing after removing masks. Females had better reported handwashing practices than male participants (OR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.15–3.09). Better knowledge of handwashing contributed to improving reported handwashing practice (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.20–1.41). Poorer handwashing practices were likely due, at least in part, to the COVID-19 pandemic information on the internet, social media, newspapers, and television. Although the number of people reported practicing their handwashing was rather high, only a quarter of them had corrected reported handwashing practices. Communication strategy on handwashing should emphasize on the minimum time required for handwashing as well as the six handwashing steps.","Huong, Le Thi Thanh; Hoang, Le Tu; Tuyet-Hanh, Tran Thi; Anh, Nguyen Quynh; Huong, Nguyen Thi; Cuong, Do Manh; Quyen, Bui Thi Tu",AIMS Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32968684/; https://doi.org/10.3934/publichealth.2020051,636

However, microstructural origins of increased bone fragility in T2DM are still controversial. DXA measurement of the contralateral hip and three-dimensional microCT analyses of femoral neck trabecular microarchitecture were performed in 32 individuals (26 women and 6 men, 78 ± 7 years). The specimens were divided to two groups: T2DM individuals with hip fracture (DMFx, n = 18) and healthy controls (CTL, n = 14). DMFx group consisted of individuals with vascular complications (DMFx_VD, n = 8) and those without vascular complications (DMFx_NVD, n = 10). T-score was significantly lower in DMFx_VD and DMFx_NVD than in controls (p < 0.001). BV/TV, Tb.N, Tb.Sp, SMI, and FD varied among DMFx_NVD, DMFx_VD, and CTL groups (p = 0.023, p = 0.004, p = 0.008, p = 0.001, p = 0.007, respectively). Specifically, BV/TV of DMFx_VD was significantly lower than that of DMFx_NVD group (p = 0.020); DMFx_NVD group had higher Tb.N and lower Tb.Sp compared with DMFx_VD (p = 0.006, p = 0.012, respectively) and CTL (p = 0.026, p = 0.035, respectively). DMFx group and healthy controls showed similar BV/TV, Tb.Th, Tb.N, Tb.Sp, Conn.D, DA, and FD (p = 0.771, p = 0.503, p = 0.285, p = 0.266, p = 0.208, p = 0.235, p = 0.688, respectively), while SMI was significantly higher in controls (p = 0.005). Two distinct phenotypes of bone fragility were identified in T2DM patients: patients with vascular complications showed impaired trabecular microarchitecture, whereas bone fragility in the group without vascular complications was independent on trabecular microarchitecture pattern. Such heterogeneity among T2DM patients may explain contradicting literature data and may set a basis for further studies to evaluate fracture risk related to T2DM.

This means more than 253 million people globally will be at higher risk of affecting by the COVID-19. The current pandemic, followed by a nationwide emergency lockdown to slow the unprecedented spread of the virus, will have a serious impact on people living with visual disabilities and even endangers their lives in the long run. Many restrictive and control measures, including the adoption of new behavioural changes (for example, social distance during outdoor movement, limiting touch or tactile contact) recommended by the government will pose immense challenges to individuals with a visual loss. This serious impact, including challenges in healthcare access, can be minimized through inclusive service approaches, involving persons with visual disabilities, caregivers, family members, and healthcare providers, along with the community to a large extent, and finally, support to improve the overall outcomes. The government, along with profit or non-profit private sectors, should consider initiating such inclusive approaches while planning responses to the pandemic. Indeed, the present COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity for health care planners and decision-makers of various organizations across India for a reformation of disabilities care. Impacts due to the pandemic and lockdown can be reduced substantially if planning and policy are in place before any emergency happened in the future.","Senjam, Suraj S",Indian J Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_1513_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32587166/,636

Leading scientists and bioethicists expressed concern about undue usage of local residents’ direly needed scarce resources at a time of great need and even about their unintended infection. They recommended either avoiding CHI trials or engaging local communities before conducting any CHIs. Similar recommendations were not made for the alternative—standard phase III field trials of these same vaccines. We argue that the health effects of CHI studies on local residents not participating in the study tend to be smaller and more positive than those of field trials. That is all the more so now that tested vaccines are being rolled out. Whether or not local community engagement is necessary for urgent vaccine studies in the pandemic, the case for its engagement is stronger prior to field trials than prior to CHI studies.","Lee, Kyungdo; Eyal, Nir",J Med Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980657/; https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2021-107229,636

Despite the progress in practical application and morphological characterization, information about their biomechanical properties is still scarce. The presence of non-membrane particles called exomeres with similar functions has recently been reported. We applied the atomic force microscopy technique to study the biomechanical properties of both types of particles in air and in liquid. We found a correlation between the biomechanical properties of the vesicles, their size, structure, and function. Our data provide useful information for a better understanding of the biomechanical characteristics of extracellular vesicles and non-membrane extracellular particles and their AFM detection. ABSTRACT: While extracellular vesicles (EVs) are extensively studied by various practical applications in biomedicine, there is still little information on their biomechanical properties due to their nanoscale size. We identified isolated blood plasma vesicles that carried on biomarkers associated with exosomes and exomeres and applied atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study them at single particle level in air and in liquid. Air measurements of exosomes revealed a mechanically indented internal cavity in which highly adhesive sites were located. In contrast, the highly adhesive sites of exomeres were located at the periphery and the observed diameter of the particles was ~35 nm. In liquid, the reversible deformation of the internal cavity of exosomes was observed and a slightly deformed lipid bi-layer was identified. In contrast, exomeres were not deformed and their observed diameter was ~16 nm. The difference in diameters might be associated with a higher sorption of water film in air. The parameters we revealed correlated with the well-known structure and function for exosomes and were observed for exomeres for the first time. Our data provide a new insight into the biomechanical properties of nanoparticles and positioned AFM as an exclusive source of in situ information about their biophysical characteristics.","Bairamukov, Viktor; Bukatin, Anton; Landa, Sergey; Burdakov, Vladimir; Shtam, Tatiana; Chelnokova, Irina; Fedorova, Natalia; Filatov, Michael; Starodubtseva, Maria",Biology (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10010004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33374530/,636

Here we present the results from a first-in-human trial of the candidate simian adenovirus vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 Chik, expressing the CHIKV full-length structural polyprotein (Capsid, E3, E2, 6k and E1). 24 adult healthy volunteers aged 18–50 years, were recruited in a dose escalation, open-label, nonrandomized and uncontrolled phase 1 trial (registry NCT03590392). Participants received a single intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 Chik at one of the three preestablished dosages and were followed-up for 6 months. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability of ChAdOx1 Chik. The secondary objective was to assess the humoral and cellular immunogenicity. ChAdOx1 Chik was safe at all doses tested with no serious adverse reactions reported. The vast majority of solicited adverse events were mild or moderate, and self-limiting in nature. A single dose induced IgG and T-cell responses against the CHIKV structural antigens. Broadly neutralizing antibodies against the four CHIKV lineages were found in all participants and as early as 2 weeks after vaccination. In summary, ChAdOx1 Chik showed excellent safety, tolerability and 100% PRNT(50) seroconversion after a single dose.","Folegatti, Pedro M.; Harrison, Kate; Preciado-Llanes, Lorena; Lopez, Fernando Ramos; Bittaye, Mustapha; Kim, Young Chan; Flaxman, Amy; Bellamy, Duncan; Makinson, Rebecca; Sheridan, Jonathan; Azar, Sasha R.; Campos, Rafael Kroon; Tilley, Mark; Tran, Nguyen; Jenkin, Daniel; Poulton, Ian; Lawrie, Alison; Roberts, Rachel; Berrie, Eleanor; Rossi, Shannan L.; Hill, Adrian; Ewer, Katie J.; Reyes-Sandoval, Arturo",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24906-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34330906/,636

This test looks at DNA methylation patterns in patient blood samples to detect cancer and also predict cancer origin. The PATHFINDER study will include ~6200 study participants from 31 sites in the United States. The study will return tests results to participants and their health care providers and will evaluate how test results affect the clinical pathway to confirm or rule out a cancer diagnosis. Results of this study could help determine how a blood-based multi-cancer early detection test will fit into clinical practice. ABSTRACT: To examine the extent of the evaluation required to achieve diagnostic resolution and the test performance characteristics of a targeted methylation cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test, ~6200 participants ≥50 years with (cohort A) or without (cohort B) ≥1 of 3 additional specific cancer risk factors will be enrolled in PATHFINDER (NCT04241796), a prospective, longitudinal, interventional, multi-center study. Plasma cfDNA from blood samples will be analyzed to detect abnormally methylated DNA associated with cancer (i.e., cancer “signal”) and a cancer signal origin (i.e., tissue of origin). Participants with a “signal detected” will undergo further diagnostic evaluation per guiding physician discretion; those with a “signal not detected” will be advised to continue guideline-recommended screening. The primary objective will be to assess the number and types of subsequent diagnostic tests needed for diagnostic resolution. Based on microsimulations (using estimates of cancer incidence and dwell times) of the typical risk profiles of anticipated participants, the median (95% CI) number of participants with a “signal detected” result is expected to be 106 (87–128). Subsequent diagnostic evaluation is expected to detect 52 (39–67) cancers. The positive predictive value of the MCED test is expected to be 49% (39–58%). PATHFINDER will evaluate the integration of a cfDNA-based MCED test into existing clinical cancer diagnostic pathways.

We report a case of cervical abscess in an infant with COVID-19 who was first considered to have MIS-C due to persistent fever, high inflammatory markers. A 10-month-old boy was admitted to the emergency department due to a 3-day fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in the nasopharyngeal swab specimen of the patient. Regarding initial clinical and laboratory findings, the patient was diagnosed to have MIS-C and bacterial co-infection. Clindamycin and ceftriaxone treatments were initiated for bacterial co-infection. Despite treatment, his fever persisted and acute phase reactants compatible with MIS-C were elevated and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered. After IVIG treatment, his fever persisted and the patient developed local inflammatory signs including erythema, tenderness, fluctuation developed. Cervical ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the findings compatible with the cervical abscess. Drainage of the cervical abscess was performed by an otolaryngologist.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective therapeutic modality for RCDI. While several studies have identified bacterial species associated with resolution of symptoms in patients, characterization of the fecal microbiome at the bacterial strain level in RCDI patients before and after FMT and healthy donors, has been lacking. The aim of this study was to examine the ability of bacterial strains from healthy donors to engraft in the gastrointestinal tract of patients with RCDI following FMT. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 22 patients with RCDI before and after FMT and their corresponding healthy donors. Total DNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The Cosmos-ID analysis platform was used for taxonomic assignment of sequences and calculation of the relative abundance (RA) of bacterial species and strains. From these data, the total number of bacterial strains (BSI), Shannon diversity index, dysbiosis index (DI), and bacterial engraftment factor, were calculated for each strain. FINDINGS: A marked reduction (p<0·0001) in the RA of total and specific bacterial strains, especially from phylum Firmicutes, was observed in RCDI patients prior to FMT. This change was associated with an increase in the DI (p<0·0001) and in pathobiont bacterial strains from phylum Proteobacteria, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Klebsiella pneumoniae UCI 34. BSI was significantly lower in this group of patients as compared to healthy donors and correlated with the Shannon Index. (p<0·0001). Identification and engraftment of bacterial strains from healthy donors revealed a greater diversity and higher relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacterial strains, including Lachnospiraceae bacterium 5_1_63FAA_u_t, Dorea formicigenerans ATCC 27755, Anaerostipes hadrusand others, in RCDI patients after FMT. INTERPRETATION: These observations identify a group of SCFA-producing bacterial strains from healthy donors that engraft well in patients with RCDI following FMT and are associated with complete resolution of clinical symptoms and bacterial dysbiosis.","Verma, Sandeep; Dutta, Sudhir K.; Firnberg, Elad; Phillips, Laila; Vinayek, Rakesh; Nair, Padmanabhan P.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34252073/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251590,636

The entire month of April 2020 remained in a complete national lockdown. Methodology: We conducted this retrospective study to compare the spectrum and outcome of trauma victims who presented to our emergency department (ED) from April 2020 (lockdown period) to a similar season matched control arm of April 2018 (non-lockdown period). Results: Our study groups included 403 trauma victims (trauma prevalence: 9.7%) from April 2020 as compared to 667 trauma victims (trauma prevalence: 10.8%) from April 2018 with an absolute decrease of −39.6% during the lockdown month. The intense lockdown resulted in an absolute decrease in the number of road traffic accidents (RTA) (−75.1%), sports-related injuries (−81.8%), bull gore injuries (−64.3%), workplace-related injuries (−50.0%), and fall from height (−3.5%). However, an absolute increase in the number of falls on level ground (FLG) (+95.7%), domestic trauma (+91.4%), and burn (+37.5%) patients were noted during the lockdown period. The proportion of trauma victims under the influence of alcohol, as determined by a positive blood alcohol content, was significantly lower in the lockdown period [adjusted OR: 0.34 (95% CI: 0.17–0.67); p-value: 0.002] as were RTAs [adjusted OR: 0.44 (95% CI: 0.31–0.62); p-value: <0.001], FLG [adjusted OR: 1.87 (95% CI: 1.14–3.06); p-value: 0.0], and head injuries [adjusted OR: 0.21 (95% CI: 0.13–0.3); p-value: <0.001]. Conclusion: During the stringent lockdown period of April 2020, there was a significant absolute decrease in the number of trauma victims, especially RTAs. The intense lockdown resulted in a significant decrease in the proportion of trauma victims under the influence of alcohol, head injuries, fractures, and dislocations.

Yet learning from reference data is complicated by batch effects between datasets, limited availability of computational resources and sharing restrictions on raw data. Here we introduce a deep learning strategy for mapping query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches). scArches uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building and contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases.","Lotfollahi, Mohammad; Naghipourfar, Mohsen; Luecken, Malte D; Khajavi, Matin; Büttner, Maren; Wagenstetter, Marco; Avsec, Ziga; Gayoso, Adam; Yosef, Nir; Interlandi, Marta; Rybakov, Sergei; Misharin, Alexander V; Theis, Fabian J",Nat. biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34462589/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-01001-7,636

SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has an unusually large genome that encodes four structural proteins and sixteen nonstructural proteins. The structural nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N is essential for linking the viral genome to the viral membrane. Both N-terminal RNA binding (N-NTD) and C-terminal dimerization domains are involved in capturing the RNA genome and, the intrinsically disordered region between these domains anchors the ribonucleoprotein complex to the viral membrane. Here, we characterized the structure of the N-NTD and its interaction with RNA using NMR spectroscopy. We observed a positively charged canyon on the surface of the N-NTD that might serve as a putative RNA binding site similarly to other coronaviruses. The subsequent NMR titrations using single-stranded and double-stranded RNA revealed a much more extensive U-shaped RNA-binding cleft lined with regularly distributed arginines and lysines. The NMR data supported by mutational analysis allowed us to construct hybrid atomic models of the N-NTD/RNA complex that provided detailed insight into RNA recognition.","Dinesh, Dhurvas Chandrasekaran; Chalupska, Dominika; Silhan, Jan; Koutna, Eliska; Nencka, Radim; Veverka, Vaclav; Boura, Evzen",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33264373/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009100,636

The CoV spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) is an attractive vaccine target but is undermined by limited immunogenicity. We describe a dimeric form of MERS-CoV RBD that overcomes this limitation. The RBD-dimer significantly increased neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers compared to conventional monomeric form and protected mice against MERS-CoV infection. Crystal structure showed RBD-dimer fully exposed dual receptor-binding motifs, the major target for NAbs. Structure-guided design further yielded a stable version of RBD-dimer as a tandem repeat single-chain (RBD-sc-dimer) which retained the vaccine potency. We generalized this strategy to design vaccines against COVID-19 and SARS, achieving 10-100-fold enhancement of NAb titers. RBD-sc-dimers in pilot scale production yielded high yields, supporting their scalability for further clinical development.

Retrospective chart review on all the confirmed patients with COVID-19 admitted to the National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) in Tokyo, Japan was conducted from May 22 through June 29, 2021. Among the 22 participants, 14 (64%) had a history of known high-risk infection behaviors. Of those, 12 reported that their activities involved eating and drinking. In addition, there were 24 high-risk situations, of those, 21 (88%) were related to indoor dining, and masks were not worn in 22 situations (92%). New source of infection has not been identified. In situations with a high known risk of infection, many cases were related to eating and drinking, and insufficient use of masks was evident. Raising risk awareness on infection prevention and control of COVID-19 is urgently needed.","Hikida, S.; Morioka, S.; Fujii, N.; Tajima, T.; Terayama, Y.; Sugiura, Y.; Ishikane, M.; Takasaki, J.; Hojo, M.; Ohmagari, N.",Global Health & Medicine,https://doi.org/10.35772/ghm.2021.01092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34532604/,636
642865,Covid19 lockdown impact on cognitions and emotions experienced during sexual intercourse,2020-11-30,"Introduction We analysed the neurological complications of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Patients and methods We conducted a retrospective, observational, descriptive study of consecutive patients admitted to the ICU due to severe respiratory symptoms secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 April and 1 June 2020. Results We included 30 patients with neurological symptoms; 21 were men (72.40%), and mean age (standard deviation [SD]) was 57.41 years (11.61). The mean duration of ICU stay was 18.83 days (14.33). The neurological conditions recorded were acute confusional syndrome in 28 patients (93.33%), neuromuscular disease in 15 (50%), headache in 5 (16.66%), cerebrovascular disease in 4 (13.33%), and encephalopathies/encephalitis in 4 (13.33%). CSF analysis results were normal in 6 patients (20%). Brain MRI or head CT showed alterations in 20 patients (66.6%). EEG was performed in all patients (100%), with 8 (26.66%) showing abnormal findings. In 5 of the 15 patients with clinical myopathy, diagnosis was confirmed with electroneuromyography. We found a correlation between older age and duration of ICU stay (P = .002; 95% CI, 4.032-6.022; OR:). Conclusions Severe COVID-19 mainly affects men, as observed in other series. Half of our patients presented acute myopathy, and almost all patients left the ICU with acute confusional syndrome, which fully resolved; no correlation was found with EEG or neuroimaging findings. Older age is associated with longer ICU stay.","Abenza-Abildúa, M. J.; Ramírez-Prieto, M. T.; Moreno-Zabaleta, R.; Arenas-Valls, N.; Salvador-Maya, M.

643150,The tumor patient in the COVID-19 pandemic–an interview-based study of 30 patients undergoing systemic antiproliferative therapy,2021-08-11,"The humoral immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination was examined. Convalescent sera after infection with variants of concern (VOCs: B.1.1.7, n = 10; B.1.351, n = 1) and sera from 100 vaccinees (Pfizer/BioNTech, BNT162b2, n = 33; Moderna, mRNA-1273, n = 11; AstraZeneca, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222, n = 56) were tested for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) directed against the viral spike (S)-protein, its receptor-binding domain (RBD), the nucleoprotein (N) and for virus-neutralizing antibodies (VNA). For the latter, surrogate assays (sVNT) and a Vero-cell based neutralization test (cVNT) were used. Maturity of IgG was determined by measuring the avidity in an immunoblot (IB). Past VOC infection resulted in a broad reactivity of anti-S IgG (100%), anti-RBD IgG (100%), and anti-N IgG (91%), while latter were absent in 99% of vaccinees. Starting approximately two weeks after the first vaccine dose, anti-S IgG (75–100%) and particularly anti-RBD IgG (98–100%) were detectable. After the second dose, their titers increased and were higher than in the convalescents. The sVNT showed evidence of VNA in 91% of convalescents and in 80–100%/100% after first/second vaccine dose, respectively. After the second dose, an increase in VNA titer and IgGs of high avidity were demonstrated by cVNT and IB, respectively. Re-vaccination contributes to a more robust immune response.","Neumann, Franziska; Rose, Ruben; Römpke, Janine; Grobe, Olaf; Lorentz, Thomas; Fickenscher, Helmut; Krumbholz, Andi",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34202276/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9070700,636

In the current study, large-scale whole-genome sequencing was performed between November 2020 and the end of March 2021 to provide a phylodynamic analysis of circulating variants over time. In addition, we compared the viral genomic features of March 2020 and March 2021. METHODS: A total of 1600 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were analyzed. Genomic analysis was associated with laboratory diagnostic volumes and positivity rates, in addition to an analysis of the association of selected variants of concern/variants of interest with disease severity and outcomes. Our real-time surveillance features a cohort of specimens from patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after completion of vaccination. RESULTS: Our data showed genomic diversity over time that was not limited to the spike sequence. A significant increase in the B.1.1.7 lineage (alpha variant) in March 2021 as well as a transient circulation of regional variants that carried both the concerning S: E484K and S: P681H substitutions were noted. Lineage B.1.243 was significantly associated with intensive care unit admission and mortality. Genomes recovered from fully vaccinated individuals represented the predominant lineages circulating at specimen collection time, and people with those infections recovered with no hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results emphasize the importance of genomic surveillance coupled with laboratory, clinical, and metadata analysis for a better understanding of the dynamics of viral spread and evolution.","Morris, C Paul; Luo, Chun Huai; Amadi, Adannaya; Schwartz, Matthew; Gallagher, Nicholas; Ray, Stuart C; Pekosz, Andrew; Mostafa, Heba H",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34272947/,636
643600,The roles of a pediatric pulmonologist during the COVID‐19 pandemic,2020-08-17,"OBJECTIVE: In December, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China. In this study, we investigate clinical and laboratory features and short-term outcomes of patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19). METHODS: All patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 3 and February 1, 2020 were included. All those patients were with laboratory-confirmed infection. Epidemiological, clinical, radiological characteristics, underlying diseases, laboratory tests treatment, complications and outcomes data were collected. Outcomes were followed up at discharge until Feb 15, 2020. RESULTS: The study cohort included 102 adult patients. The median (IQR) age was 54 years (37-67years) and 48.0% were female. A total of 34 patients (33.3%) were exposed to source of transmission in the hospital setting (as health care workers, patients, or visitors) and 10 patients (9.8%) had a familial cluster. Eighteen patients (17.6%) were admitted to the ICU, and 17 patients died (mortality, 16.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.4%-23.9%). Among patients who survived, they were younger, more likely were health care workers and less likely suffered from comorbidities. They were also less likely suffered from complications. There was no difference in drug treatment rates between the survival and non-survival groups. Patients who survived less likely required admission to the intensive care unit (14.1% vs. 35.3%). Chest imaging examination showed that death patients more likely had ground-glass opacity (41.2% vs. 12.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate was high among the COVID-19 patients described in our cohort who met our criteria for inclusion in this analysis. Patient characteristics seen more frequently in those who died were development of systemic complications following onset of the illness and the severity of disease requiring admission to the ICU. Our data support those described by others that COVID-19 infection results from human-to-human transmission, including familial clustering of cases, and nosocomial transmission. There were no differences in mortality among those who did or did not receive antimicrobial or glucocorticoid drug treatment.","Cao, Jianlei; Tu, Wen-Jun; Cheng, Wenlin; Yu, Lei; Liu, Ya-Kun; Hu, Xiaoyong; Liu, Qiang",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32239127/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa243,636
643605,The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Massive Threat for Those Living With Cardiovascular Disease Among the Poorest Billion,2020-09-18,"As climate change advances, communities across the United States are adapting to the increased threat of wildfires, drought, heatwaves, and infectious diseases. Such disasters are expected to become more frequent and severe. Now more than ever, it is crucial to understand how these events amplify existing inequalities, and how to lessen the resulting harms. Differences in human vulnerability to disaster stem from a range of social, economic, historical, and political factors. We argue that given their social status, undocumented Latino/a and Indigenous immigrants are particularly vulnerable to disasters and require special consideration in disaster planning. They are disproportionately affected by racial discrimination, exploitation, economic hardships, less English and Spanish proficiency, and fear of deportation in their everyday lives— their pre-disaster marginalized status. In the case of the Thomas Fire in California's Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, we show that emergency response and recovery efforts ignored their needs. Resources were directed toward privileged individuals, leaving local immigrant rights and environmental justice groups to provide essential services such as language access to emergency information in Spanish and Indigenous tongues; labor protections for farmworkers endangered in the fields; and a private disaster relief fund for undocumented immigrants ineligible for federal aid. The article concludes with preliminary participant observations from the COVID-19 pandemic response in the region, indicating how lessons from the fire have informed official actions. As governments grapple with the increasing severity of disasters, understanding the differential impacts on undocumented immigrants can help improve disaster planning to protect the most vulnerable and stigmatized populations.","Méndez, Michael; Flores-Haro, Genevieve; Zucker, Lucas",Geoforum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834081/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.07.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016718520301925; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718520301925,636

We here investigated the geographical character of the infection and correlate it with several annual satellite and ground indexes of air quality in China, Iran, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, U.K. and U.S.A. Adjusting for population size, we find more viral infections in those areas afflicted by high PM 2.5 and Nitrogen Dioxide values. Higher mortality was also correlated with relatively poor air quality. In Italy, the correspondence between the Po valley pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infections and induced mortality was the starkest, originating right in the most polluted European area. Air pollution appears to be for this disease a risk factor similar to smoking.

However, little is known about how the COVID-19 vaccination would affect mental health and preventive behaviors toward the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to address this issue among 4244 individuals at several COVID-19 vaccination sites in Guangzhou, China. Using univariate analysis and multiple linear regression models, we found that major demographic characteristics, such as biological sex, age, education level, and family per capita income, are the dominant influencing factors associated with health beliefs, mental health, and preventive behaviors. After propensity score matching (PSM) treatment, we further assessed the changes in the scores of health belief, mental health, and preventive behaviors between the pre-vaccination group and the post-vaccination group. When compared to individuals in the pre-vaccination group, a moderate but statistically significant lower score was observed in the post-vaccination group (p = 0.010), implying possibly improved psychological conditions after COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, there was also a moderate but statistically higher score of preventive behaviors in the post-vaccination group than in the pre-vaccination group (p < 0.001), suggesting a higher probability to take preventive measures after COVID-19 vaccination. These findings have implications for implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions combined with mass vaccination to control the rebound of COVID-19 outbreaks.","Yuan, Yue; Deng, Zhaomin; Chen, Musha; Yin, Di; Zheng, Jiazhen; Liu, Yajie; Liu, Xinglai; Zou, Huachun; Zhang, Chunhuan; Sun, Caijun",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9091044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579281/,636

Its features are anemia, predisposal to bacterial infections and complications such as vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR), which lead to increased rate of morbidity and mortality even in the era of hydroxyurea. The interaction between sickle cells, neutrophils, platelets or endothelial cells in small vessels results in hemolysis and has been considered the disease’s main pathophysiological mechanism. Complement activation has been reported in small cohorts of SCD patients, but the governing mechanism has not been fully elucidated. This will be important to predict the patient group that would benefit from complement inhibition. Until now, eculizumab-mediated complement inhibition has shown beneficial effects in DHTR, with limited reports in patients with VOC. In the meantime, several innovative agents are under clinical development Our state-of-the-art review summarizes current data on 1) complement activation in SCD both in steady state and crisis, 2) underlying mechanisms of complement over-activation for the clinician in the context of SCD, 3) actions of hydroxyurea and new therapeutic approaches including indirect involvement in complement activation, and 4) novel paradigms in complement inhibition.","Varelas, Christos; Tampaki, Athina; Sakellari, Ioanna; Anagnostopoulos, Αchilles; Gavriilaki, Eleni; Vlachaki, Efthymia",J Blood Med,https://doi.org/10.2147/jbm.s287301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33790681/,636

Blood monocytes (PBMC) are being intensively studied as immunologic and pathologic responders to the new SARS-CoV-2 virus (CoV19) but direct evidence showing CoV19 in monocytes is lacking. Circulating myeloid cells that take up residence in various organs can harbor viral genomes for many years in lymphatic tissues and brain, and act as a source for re-infection and/or post-viral organ pathology. Because nucleocapsid (NC) proteins protect the viral genome we tested PBMC from acutely ill patients for the diagnostic 72bp NC RNA plus adjacent longer (301bp) transcripts. In 2/11 patient PBMC, but no uninfected controls, long NCs were positive as early as 2-6 days after hospital admission as validated by sequencing. Pathogenic viral fragments, or the infectious virus, are probably disseminated by rare myeloid migratory cells that incorporate CoV19 by several pathways. Predictably, these cells carried CoV19 to heart and brain educing the late post-viral pathologies now evident.","Pagano, Nathan; Laurent-Rolle, Maudry; Hsu, Jack Chun-Chieh; Vogels, Chantal BF; Grubaugh, Nathan D; Manuelidis, Laura",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.16.423113,636

In its most severe form, YF manifests as a hemorrhagic fever that causes severe damage to visceral organs. Although coagulopathy is a defining feature of severe YF in humans, the mechanism by which it develops remains uncertain. Hepatocytes are a major target of yellow fever virus (YFV) infection, and the coagulopathy in severe YF has long been attributed to massive hepatocyte infection and destruction that results in a defect in clotting factor synthesis. However, when we analyzed blood from Brazilian patients with severe YF, we found high concentrations of plasma D-dimer, a fibrin split product, suggestive of a concurrent consumptive process. To define the relationship between coagulopathy and hepatocellular tropism, we compared infection and disease in Fah(−/−), Rag2(−/−), and Il2rɣ(−/−) mice engrafted with human hepatocytes (hFRG mice) and rhesus macaques using a highly pathogenic African YFV strain. YFV infection of macaques and hFRG mice caused substantial hepatocyte infection, liver damage, and coagulopathy as defined by virological, clinical, and pathological criteria. However, only macaques developed a consumptive coagulopathy whereas YFV-infected hFRG mice did not. Thus, infection of cell types other than hepatocytes likely contributes to the consumptive coagulopathy associated with severe YF in primates and humans. These findings expand our understanding of viral hemorrhagic disease and associated coagulopathy and suggest directions for clinical management of severe YF cases.","Bailey, Adam L.; Kang, Liang-I; de Assis Barros D’Elia Zanella, Luiz Gonzaga Francisco; Silveira, Cássia G.

646543,Reusing N95 Respirators at Weekly Intervals During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-02-24,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic presents a significant infection prevention and control challenge. The admission of large numbers of patients with suspected COVID-19 disease risks overwhelming the capacity to protect other patients from exposure. The delay between clinical suspicion and confirmatory testing adds to the complexity of the problem. METHODS: We implemented a triage tool aimed at minimising hospital acquired COVID-19 particularly to patients at risk of severe disease. Patients were allocated to triage categories defined by likelihood of COVID-19 and risk of a poor outcome. Category A (low-likelihood; high-risk), B (high-likelihood; high-risk), C (high-likelihood; low-risk) and D (low-likelihood; low-risk). This determined the order of priority for isolation in single-occupancy rooms with Category A the highest. Patients in other groups were cohorted when isolation capacity was limited with additional interventions to reduce transmission. RESULTS: 93 patients were evaluated with 79 (85%) receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis during their admission. Of those without a COVID-19 diagnosis: 10 were initially triaged to Category A; 0 to B; 1 to C and 4 to D. All high risk patients requiring isolation were, therefore, admitted to single-occupancy rooms and protected from exposure. 28 (30%) suspected COVID-19 patients were evaluated to be low risk (groups C & D) and eligible for cohorting. No symptomatic hospital acquired infections were detected in the cohorted patients. DISCUSSION: Application of a clinical triage tool to guide isolation and cohorting decisions may reduce the risk of hospital acquired transmission of COVID-19 especially to individuals at the greatest of risk of severe disease.","Patterson, Benjamin; Marks, Michael; Martinez-Garcia, Gema; Bidwell, Gabriella; Luintel, Akish; Ludwig, Dalia; Parks, Tom; Gothard, Philip; Thomas, Rik; Logan, Sarah; Shaw, Karen; Stone, Neil; Brown, Mike",J Hosp Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.05.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32485197/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120302759?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670120302759,636
647129,Commentary: COVID-19 pandemic — 1 Year later,2021-02-02,"BACKGROUND: Frailty has been associated with worse prognosis following COVID-19 infection. While several studies have reported the association between frailty and COVID-19 mortality or length of hospital stay, there have been no community-based studies on the association between frailty and risk of severe infection. Considering that different definitions have been identified to assess frailty, this study aimed to compare the association between frailty and severe COVID-19 infection in UK Biobank using two frailty classifications: the frailty phenotype and the frailty index. METHODS: A total of 383,845 UK Biobank participants recruited 2006–2010 in England (211,310 [55.1%] women, baseline age 37–73 years) were included. COVID-19 test data were provided by Public Health England (available up to 28 June 2020). An adapted version of the frailty phenotype derived by Fried et al. was used to define frailty phenotype (robust, pre-frail, or frail). A previously validated frailty index was derived from 49 self-reported questionnaire items related to health, disease and disability, and mental wellbeing (robust, mild frailty, and moderate/severe frailty). Both classifications were derived from baseline data (2006–2010). Poisson regression models with robust standard errors were used to analyse the associations between both frailty classifications and severe COVID-19 infection (resulting in hospital admission or death), adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: Of UK Biobank participants included, 802 were admitted to hospital with and/or died from COVID19 (323 deaths and 479 hospitalisations). After analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, a higher risk of COVID-19 was observed for pre-frail (risk ratio (RR) 1.47 [95% CI 1.26; 1.71]) and frail (RR 2.66 [95% CI 2.04; 3.47]) individuals compared to those classified as robust using the frailty phenotype. Similar results were observed when the frailty index was used (RR mildly frail 1.46 [95% CI 1.26; 1.71] and RR moderate/severe frailty 2.43 [95% CI 1.91; 3.10]). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection resulting in hospital admission or death, irrespective of how it was measured and independent of sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Public health strategies need to consider the additional risk that COVID-19 poses in individuals with frailty, including which additional preventive measures might be required.","Petermann-Rocha, Fanny; Hanlon, Peter; Gray, Stuart R.; Welsh, Paul; Gill, Jason M.

Cytokeratin (CK)19-positive (CK19+) HCC is especially aggressive; early identification of this subtype and timely intervention can potentially improve clinical outcomes. In the present study, we developed a preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics model for noninvasive and accurate classification of CK19+ HCC. A multicenter and time-independent cohort of 257 patients were retrospectively enrolled (training cohort, n = 143; validation cohort A, n = 75; validation cohort B, n = 39). A total of 968 radiomics features were extracted from preoperative multisequence MR images. The maximum relevance minimum redundancy algorithm was applied for feature selection. Multiple logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms were used to construct the radiomics model, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of corresponding classifiers. The incidence of CK19+ HCC was significantly higher in male patients. The ANN-derived combined classifier comprising 12 optimal radiomics features showed the best diagnostic performance, with AUROCs of 0.857, 0.726, and 0.790 in the training cohort and validation cohorts A and B, respectively. The combined model based on multisequence MRI radiomics features can be used for preoperative noninvasive and accurate classification of CK19+ HCC, so that personalized management strategies can be developed.","Yang, Fan; Wan, Yidong; Xu, Lei; Wu, Yichao; Shen, Xiaoyong; Wang, Jianguo; Lu, Di; Shao, Chuxiao; Zheng, Shusen; Niu, Tianye; Xu, Xiao",Front Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.672126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34476208/,636
648122,The Psychological Symptoms of College Student in China during the Lockdown of COVID-19 Epidemic,2021-04-11,"INTRODUCTION: Many institutions in numerous countries have made changes in their health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic. One change has been to reduce elective neurosurgery cases, which has impacted neurosurgery education. Published literature is lacking about the healthcare services, education, and residents’ well-being during adaptation to the pandemic, especially in national referral hospitals in developing countries. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study on current neurosurgical services during 2020. We evaluated 34 neurosurgery residents in Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital using a self-made questionnaire to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their surroundings, education process, and satisfaction with the currently adapted education program. We used the modified Maslach Burnout Inventory to assess burnout in the residents before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: Neurosurgical residents spent more time studying neurosurgical theory (Mode 1–1.5h/day, p < 0.05) but spent less time learning neurosurgical skills (Mode 30 min–1 h/day, p < 0.05) compared to before the pandemic. The resident satisfaction mean score (scale 0–10) was 7.58 for live surgery and 8.53 for the microsurgical skills lab training program. On a scale of 1–10, the residents’ stress level increased after the pandemic but the change was not statistically significant (6.61 ± 1.87, p > 0.05). The Modified Maslach Burnout inventory score was 3.02 ± 3.74 during the pandemic, and increased from before the pandemic (2.41 ± 3.18), but the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemics have reduced the working hours and the clinical exposure of neurosurgical residents. Fortunately, this pandemic has led to a new opportunity to find many suitable learning methods which may decrease the risk of burnout. The psychological burden of residents is still worrisome, and planned management is necessary to sustain resident performance.","Nugroho, Setyo Widi; Pradhana, Ivan; Gunawan, Kevin",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34458606/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844021018600; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07757; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844021018600,636
648164,Diabolical dilemmas of COVID-19: An empirical study into Dutch society’s trade-offs between health impacts and other effects of the lockdown,2020-09-16,"COVID-19 being a public health emergency of international concern has emerged in most African countries including Niger. Niger, a landlocked country, is tasked with controlling the pandemic. However, of the big challenges the country faced is the fragility of healthcare system which posed limitations to the fight against the virus. The virus overwhelmed the fragile healthcare system which led to inaccessibility of quality healthcare to the citizens coupled with issues of flooding and economic recession that happened during the pandemic. The healthcare sectored has further been crippled by exposure and infection of the already insufficient healthcare workers. In addition to this, there was the burden of NTDs and other communicable and non-communicable diseases that subverted the country in the depths of difficulties. As per the predictions of World Bank, the poverty curve is likely to escalate due to the outrageous impacts of COVID-19. Adding on to this, the occurrence of natural disasters such as flooding has further stretched the country. It's no coincidence that the country would confront plethora of challenges amidst the second wave. Therefore, timely decision and necessary interventions are needed to strengthen the country's fight against the pandemic. However, this is only feasible when Nigerien government, international allies and other wealthy nations work closely to ensure that the challenges faced by the healthcare system are tackled.","Nzeribe, Emmanuella; Michael, Udofa Edidiong; Musa, Shuaibu Saidu; Marc, Mirindi Batumike; David, Success; Bassey, Esther Edet; Essar, Mohammad Yasir; Adebisi, Yusuff Adebayo; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213398421001056; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213398421001056?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34095612/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2021.100797,636
648330,Linking excess mortality to mobility data during the first wave of COVID-19 in England and Wales,2021-04-21,"We had earlier proposed a hypothesis to explain the mechanism of perpetuation of immunological memory based on the operation of idiotypic network in the complete absence of antigen. Experimental evidences were provided for memory maintenance through anti-idiotypic antibody (Ab(2)) carrying the internal image of the antigen. In the present work, we describe a structural basis for such memory perpetuation by molecular modeling and structural analysis studies. A three-dimensional model of Ab(2) was generated and the structure of the antigenic site on the hemagglutinin protein H of Rinderpest virus was modeled using the structural template of hemagglutinin protein of Measles virus. Our results show that a large portion of heavy chain containing the CDR regions of Ab(2) resembles the domain of the hemagglutinin housing the epitope regions. The similarity demonstrates that an internal image of the H antigen is formed in Ab(2), which provides a structural basis for functional mimicry demonstrated earlier. This work brings out the importance of the structural similarity between a domain of hemagglutinin protein to that of its corresponding Ab(2). It provides evidence that Ab(2) is indeed capable of functioning as surrogate antigen and provides support to earlier proposed relay hypothesis which has provided a mechanism for the maintenance of immunological memory.","Vani, J.; Chatterjee, Jhinuk; Shaila, M.S.; Nayak, R.; Chandra, Nagasuma R.",Mol Immunol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589008007633; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2008.11.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589008007633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19157554/,636
649445,Changing trends in ocular trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA,2021-08-19,"Much less is known about the etiology of influenza‐like illness in China. A continuous surveillance of 16 respiratory viruses was conducted from November 2010 to October 2011 of outpatients with influenza‐like illness in Nanjing, China. The two largest general hospitals and a provincial virus laboratory in Nanjing participated in this study. Throat swabs were collected from outpatients during medical visits for influenza‐like illness and were tested for 16 respiratory viruses using PCR. Three hundred seventeen viruses were detected in samples from 246 (50.6%) patients with influenza‐like illness. The viruses found mostly commonly were influenza, rhinovirus, hCoV HKU1, and adenovirus. The identification rates of respiratory viruses differed significantly among different sampling seasons (P = 0.0002). The rates of influenza A and hCoV HKU1 were much higher during the influenza‐like illness winter peak than during the influenza‐like illness summer peak and other months. Co‐infections were detected in 57 (11.7%) patients and were found most commonly in adults older than 60 years. RSV was detected in 5.9% and 2.6% of patients who were 0–5 and 6–15 years old, respectively, but was not detected in other age groups. This study confirmed that multiple respiratory viruses may circulate concurrently in the population and account for a large proportion of influenza‐like illness. In addition to influenza virus, hCoV HKU1 may be associated with the influenza‐like illness winter peak in Nanjing, China. J. Med.

649728,Essential surgery during the covid 19 pandemic: The implementation of a pre-operative universal covid testing program,2020-08-31,"Background: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) has declined dramatically in wealthier countries in the past three decades, but it remains endemic in many lower-resourced regions and can have significant costs to households. The objective of this study was to quantify the economic burden of RHD among Ugandans affected by RHD. Methods: This was a cross-sectional cost-of-illness study that randomly sampled 87 participants and their households from the Uganda National RHD registry between December 2018 and February 2020. Using a standardized survey instrument, we asked participants and household members about outpatient and inpatient RHD costs and financial coping mechanisms incurred over the past 12 months. We used descriptive statistics to analyze levels and distributions of costs and the frequency of coping strategies. Multivariate Poisson regression models were used to assess relationships between socioeconomic characteristics and utilization of financial coping mechanisms. Results: Most participants were young or women, demonstrating a wide variation in socioeconomic status. Outpatient and inpatient costs were primarily driven by transportation, medications, and laboratory tests, with overall RHD direct and indirect costs of $78 per person-year. Between 20 and 35 percent of households experienced catastrophic healthcare expenditure, with participants in the Northern and Western Regions 5–10 times more likely to experience such hardship and utilize financial coping mechanisms than counterparts in the Central Region, a wealthier area. Increases in total RHD costs were positively correlated with increasing use of coping behaviors. Conclusion: Ugandan households affected by RHD, particularly in lower-income areas, incur out-of-pocket costs that are very high relative to income, exacerbating the poverty trap. Universal health coverage policy reforms in Uganda should include mechanisms to reduce or eliminate out-of-pocket expenditures for RHD and other chronic diseases.","Opara, Chinonso C.; Du, Yuxian; Kawakatsu, Yoshito; Atala, Jenifer; Beaton, Andrea Z.; Kansiime, Rosemary; Nakitto, Miriam; Ndagire, Emma; Nalubwama, Haddy; Okello, Emmy; Watkins, David A.; Su, Yanfang",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34395548/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.636280,636

METHODS: An observational study was performed in 11 hospitals participating in the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program between January 7 and March 30, 2011. Using a standardized data collection tool, observers recorded HCWs selecting and removing PPE and performing hand hygiene on entry into the rooms of febrile respiratory illness patients. RESULTS: The majority of HCWs put on gloves (88%, n = 390), gown (83%, n = 368), and mask (88%, n = 386). Only 37% (n = 163) were observed to have put on eye protection. Working in a pediatric unit was significantly associated with not wearing eye protection (7%), gown (70%), gloves (77%), or mask (79%). Half of the observed HCWs (54%, n = 206) removed their PPE in the correct sequence. Twenty-six percent performed hand hygiene after removing their gloves, 46% after removing their gown, and 57% after removing their mask and/or eye protection. CONCLUSION: Overall adherence with appropriate PPE use in health care settings involving febrile respiratory illness patients was modest, particularly on pediatric units. Interventions to improve PPE use should be targeted toward the use of recommended precautions (eg, eye protection), HCWs working in pediatric units, the correct sequence of PPE removal, and performing hand hygiene.","Mitchell, Robyn; Roth, Virginia; Gravel, Denise; Astrakianakis, George; Bryce, Elizabeth; Forgie, Sarah; Johnston, Lynn; Taylor, Geoffrey; Vearncombe, Mary",Am J Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23073484/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655312008140; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2012.04.332; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655312008140,636
650046,Tragic Optimism as a Buffer Against COVID-19 Suffering and the Psychometric Properties of a Brief Version of the Life Attitudes Scale,2021-09-06,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) treatment among cancer patients has been shown to have antiviral effects by reactivating exhausted T cells. However, they could also trigger inflammatory storm. Therefore, prior exposure to ICIs may influence the risk of SARS-CoV2 infection and subsequent mortality. Recent results from studies of ICIs treatment on incidence and mortality of COVID-19 are controversial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched databases PubMed, Embase, ISI of Knowledge, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), as well as pre-print databases (MedRxiv and BioRxiv) for retrospective and prospective studies comparing ICIs versus other antitumor treatments in cancer patients in the area of COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was the incidence of COVID-19. The secondary outcomes were mortality of COVID-19. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies with a total of 117735 patients were selected. Compared with other antitumor treatments, prior exposure to ICIs had not an increased risk of incidence [Odds ratio (OR), 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.60-1.18; P=0.32] and mortality (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.91-1.62; P=0.18) of COVID-19 infectioin. Our subgroup and meta-regression analyses indicated that prior exposure to ICIs may reduce the incidence of COVID-19 in metastatic cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference on incidence and mortality of COVID-19 between prior exposure to ICIs with other anti-tumor treatments.

Unlike most of the other reported studies on COVID-19 lockdown, this study provides variations over a unique tropical rural environment located at a scientifically strategic location in the Southern Indian peninsula. Striking differences in the time series and diurnal variability have been observed in different phases of the lockdown. The levels of most species that are primarily emitted from anthropogenic activities reduced significantly during the lockdown which also impacted the levels and diurnal variability of secondary species like O(3). When compared with the same periods in 2019, short-lived trace gas species such as NO, NO(2), SO(2) which have direct anthropogenic emission influence have shown the reduction over 50%, whereas species like CO and O(3) which have direct as well as indirect impacts of anthropogenic emissions have shown reductions up to 10%. Long-lived species (CO(2) and CH(4)) have shown negligible difference (<1%). BC and AOD have shown reductions over 20%. Particulate Matter (1, 2.5 and 10) reductions have been in the range of 40 to 50% when compared to the pre-lockdown period. The changes in shortwave downward radiation at the surface, diffuse component due to the scattering and diffuse fraction have been +2.2%, −4.1% and −2.4%, respectively, in comparison with 2019. In contrast with the studies over urban environments, air quality category over the rural environment remained same during the lockdown despite reduction in pollutants level.

Herein we investigate associations between VL and parameters such as severity of symptoms, disposition (admission vs direct discharge), length of hospitalization, and admission to the intensive care unit, length of need for oxygen support and overall survival in a cohort of 205 patients from a tertiary care center in New York City. VL was determined using q-PCR and Log10 transformed for normalization. Univariate and multivariate regression models were used to test these associations. We found that diagnostic viral load is significantly lower in hospitalized patients than in patients not hospitalized (log10 VL = 3.3 vs.4.0; p=0.018) after adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI, and comorbidities. Higher VL was associated with shorter duration of the symptoms in all patients and hospitalized patients only and shorter hospital stay (coefficient =-2.02,-2.61, -2.18; p<0.001, p=0.002, p=0.013, respectively). No significant association was noted between VL, admission to ICU, length of oxygen support, and overall survival.

651860,Psychological and Emotional Effects of Digital Technology on Children in COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-08-25,"ABSTRACT: This article interprets emerging scholarship on rental housing platforms—particularly the most well-known and used short- and long-term rental housing platforms—and considers how the technological processes connecting both short-term and long-term rentals to the platform economy are transforming cities. It discusses potential policy approaches to more equitably distribute benefits and mitigate harms. We argue that information technology is not value-neutral. While rental housing platforms may empower data analysts and certain market participants, the same cannot be said for all users or society at large. First, user-generated online data frequently reproduce the systematic biases found in traditional sources of housing information. Evidence is growing that the information broadcasting potential of rental housing platforms may increase rather than mitigate sociospatial inequality. Second, technology platforms curate and shape information according to their creators’ own financial and political interests. The question of which data—and people—are hidden or marginalized on these platforms is just as important as the question of which data are available. Finally, important differences in benefits and drawbacks exist between short-term and long-term rental housing platforms, but are underexplored in the literature: this article unpacks these differences and proposes policy recommendations. POLICY AND PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS: As rental housing technologies upend traditional market processes in favor of platform oligopolies, policymakers must reorient these processes toward the public good. Long-term and short-term rental platforms offer different market benefits and drawbacks, but the latter in particular requires proactive regulation to mitigate harm. At a minimum, policymakers must require that short-term rental platforms provide the information necessary for cities to enforce current, let alone new, housing regulations. Practitioners should be cautious inferring market conditions from rental housing platform data, due to difficult-to-measure sampling biases.","Boeing, Geoff; Besbris, Max; Wachsmuth, David; Wegmann, Jake",Urban Transform,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42854-021-00024-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34423256/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08229v1.pdf,636

We aimed to evaluate the definite efficacy and safety of corticosteroid in the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Forty-six hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia hospitalized at Wuhan Union Hospital from January 20 to February 25, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether they received corticosteroid treatment. The clinical symptoms and chest computed tomography(CT) results were compared. Results: A total of 26 patients received intravenous administration of methylprednisolone with a dosage of 1-2mg/kg/d for 5-7 days, while the remaining patients not. There was no significant difference in age, sex, comorbidities, clinical or laboratory parameters between the two groups on admission. The average number of days for body temperature back to the normal range was significantly shorter in patients with administration of methylprednisolone when compared to those without administration of methylprednisolone (2.06 ± 0.28 vs. 5.29 ± 0.70, P=0.010). The patients with administration of methylprednisolone had a faster improvement of SpO2, while patients without administration of methylprednisolone had a significantly longer interval of using supplemental oxygen therapy (8.2days[IQR 7.0-10.3] vs. 13.5days(IQR 10.3-16); P<0.001). In terms of chest CT, the absorption degree of the focus was significantly better in patients with administration of methylprednisolone.

The pharmacist is a member of the interprofessional care team with the ability to provide non-judgmental, high-quality, and patient-centered care. The community pharmacy setting itself offers specific advantages which promote access, including availability in most neighborhoods, broad hours of operation, lack of need for an appointment, and a stigma-free space which is frequented for other goods and services. This commentary suggests specific ways for pharmacies to improve access to contraception, emergency contraception, and abortion in line with national quality recommendations. Particular focus is given to the intersection of sexual and reproductive health resources and referrals within the pharmacy profession as well as the training and technical assistance tools which can help address unmet patient need.","Pfaff, Anna; Rafie, Sally",Pharmacy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33316908/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy8040236,636

652383,Brain Death Diagnosis for Potential Organ Donors During the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been identified in China in late December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family. Coronaviruses have genetic proofreading mechanism that corrects copying mistakes and thus SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity is extremely low. Despite lower mutation rate of the virus, researchers have detected a total of 12,706 mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the majority of which were single nucleotide polymorphisms. Sequencing data revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 accumulates two-single nucleotide mutations per month in its genome. Recently, an amino acid aspartate (D) to glycine (G) (D614G) mutation due to an adenine to guanine nucleotide change at position 23,403 at the 614th amino-acid position of the spike protein in the original reference genotype has been identified. The SARS-CoV-2 viruses that carry the spike protein D614G mutation have become dominant variant around the world. The D614G mutation has been found to be associated with 3 other mutations in the spike protein. Clinical and pseudovirus experimental studies have demonstrated that the spike protein D614G mutation alters the virus phenotype. However, the impact of the mutation on the rate of transmission between people, disease severity and the vaccine and therapeutic development remains unclear. Three variants of SARS-CoV-2 have recently been identified. They are B.1.1.7 (UK) variant, B.1.351 (N501Y.V2, South African) variant and B.1.1.28 (Brazilian) variant. Epidemiological data suggest that they have a higher transmissibility than the original variant. There are reports that some vaccines are less efficacious against the B.1.351 variant. This review article discusses the effects of novel mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome on transmission, clinical outcomes and vaccine development.","Akkiz, Hikmet",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.636532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34026780/,636

Methods: Data on referrals to cardiological units (n=81,008), emergency department (ED) visits (n=10,001) and hospitalisations (n=8654) for CAD were collected from three large Finnish hospitals, and incidences were calculated per 100,000 persons for the years 2017 through 2020. Year 2020 was compared to the reference years 2017-2019 by incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Referrals to cardiological units decreased after the onset of the pandemic in March to May (IRR=0.83, 95% CI 0.81-0.86). ED visits due to acute coronary syndrome decreased during the first months of the pandemic, with the overall annual incidence 2-14% lower than in the reference years. ED visits due to chronic CAD increased prominently during in April and May compared to the corresponding months in the reference years (IRR=1.49, 95% CI 1.23-1.81 in April; IRR=1.57, 95% CI 1.32-1.89 in May) and remained elevated until the end of 2020, with an increase in annual incidence of 17% (IRR=1.17, 95% CI 1.11-1.24).

654185,New safety measure for the endoscopic procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic: New STEP,2020-09-17,"BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding short, single-stranded RNA molecules that may serve as biomarkers for various inflammatory and molecular mechanisms underlying bone and tissue remodeling consequent to orthodontic force application. METHODS: A thorough literature search in major databases was conducted in March 2021 to generate evidence for miRNAs in orthodontics, with prior PROSPERO registration. The initial search revealed 920 articles, subjected to strict selection criteria according to PRISMA, and resulted in final inclusion of four studies. Quality assessment by QUADAS-2 classified three studies as unclear risk-of-bias while the applicability was high. Further, bioinformatic analysis was performed to identify the target genes from the miRNA database (miRDB) and TargetScan databases and their protein-protein interaction pathways with the STRING analysis. RESULTS: Multiple miRNAs in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of orthodontic patients were seen, including miRNA-21, 27(a/b), 29(a/b/c), 34,146(a/b), 101, and 214 along with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 14 in one study. A statistically significant increase in expression of miRNA-29a/b/c,101, 21 from pre-treatment (before initiation of retraction) was seen to reach a peak at 4–6 weeks (wk) of retraction. On the contrary, miRNA-34a showed downregulation from the 1 day to 4 wk of retraction and also, negatively correlated with MMPs-2,9,14 levels at the same observation times. The distance of canine movement showed mild correlation with miRNA-27a/b, 214 at 2 wk of retraction. Bioinformatics revealed 1213 mutual target genes which were analyzed for inter-relational pathways using Cytoscape plugin, MCODE. Further, 894 prominent protein interactions were identified from the STRING database and SMAD4, IGF1, ADAMTS6, COL4A1, COL1A1, COL3A1, FGFR1, COL19A1, FBN1, COL5A1, MGAT4A, LTBP1, MSR1, COL11A1, and COL5A3 were recognized as the hub genes. Their interactions were able to isolate multiple miRNAs: hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-29b-2-5p, hsa-miR-29b-3p, hsa-miR-34a-3p, hsa-miR-27a-5p, hsa-miR-29a-5p, hsa-miR-29b-1-5p, hsa-miR-29c-3p, hsa-miR-214-5p, hsa-miR-27a-3p, hsa-miR-29a-3p, hsamiR-146-5p, which were found promising as biomarkers for tooth movement. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support using miRNAs as biomarkers in varied orthodontic study designs and for inter-relationships with pathological settings like periodontal disease, pre-malignancies, or conditions like obesity or metabolic irregularities, etc. The identified target genes and their protein interaction pathways can be used to propose precision therapies, focusing on ideal tooth movement with minimal iatrogenic side-effects.

State Bar of California: Test Takers with Disabilities Sue State Bar of California for Forcing Them to Test In-Person During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Singapore instituted lockdown measures from 7th February 2020 to 1st June 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of cases from the national trauma registry was carried out comparing the lockdown period (7th February 2020 to 1st June 2020) to the pre-lockdown period (7th February 2019 to 1st June 2019). Data extracted included the volume of Tier 1 (ISS >15) and Tier 2 (ISS 9-15) cases and epidemiology. Subgroup analysis was performed for Tier 1 patient outcomes. RESULTS: Trauma volume decreased by 19.5% with a 32% drop in Tier 1 cases. Road traffic and workplace accidents decreased by 50% (p<0.01) while interpersonal violence showed an increase of 37.5% (p=0.34). There was an 18.1% decrease in usage of trauma workflows (p=0.01), with an increase in time to intervention for Tier 1 patients from 88 to 124 minutes (p =0.22). Discharge to community facilities decreased from 31.4% to 17.1% (p < 0.05). There was no increase in inpatient mortality, length of stay in critical care, or length of stay overall. CONCLUSION: There was an overall decrease in major trauma cases during the lockdown period, particularly road traffic accidents and worksite injuries and a relative increase in interpersonal violence. Redeployment of manpower and hospital resources may have contributed to decreased usage of trauma workflows and community facilities. In the event of further lockdowns it is necessary to plan for trauma coverage and maintain use of workflows to facilitate early intervention.","Kang, Min Li; Lim, Woan Wui; Lee, Daniel Jin Keat; Goo, Jerry Tiong Thye",Singap. med. j,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34617695/; https://doi.org/10.11622/smedj.2021131,636

In response to these concerns, healthcare systems and organisations rapidly established staff support and wellbeing programmes. While there is emerging literature related to the effectiveness of such interventions, what is less well understood and evaluated is the evidence base regarding how such programmes are implemented; what supports and hinders their implementation; and how or if they are maintained following the initial acute phase of the pandemic. This study addresses this gap by studying the implementation process of COVID-19-related staff wellbeing programmes in the three UK NHS Trusts that make up one of Europe’s largest academic health sciences centres, King’s Health Partners. METHODS: We will conduct a prospective, cross-sectional descriptive study using qualitative research methods and non-probability purposive sampling to identify a study participant group representative of the population and implementation activity of interest. We will conduct semi-structured interviews of between 30 min and 1 h. We will identify theory-driven elements in the dataset using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (barriers and drivers), Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment Framework (timeline/chronology/evolution of the implementation and different issues at different times) and Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (implementation strategies). We will then identify indicators of these constructs within the dataset and report them, as well as their inter-relationships. DISCUSSION: Through this study, we hope to better understand what factors hindered and enabled the implementation of three inter-linked staff support and wellbeing programmes and how/to what extent have these programmes been sustained. We will also explore whether implementation science frameworks are applicable and beneficial in conceptualising and understanding crisis driven and rapidly implemented interventions and in what ways, if any, they need to be adjusted when used in unprecedented circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Krausova, Barbora; Gnanapragasam, Sam Nishanth; Demetriou, Len; Beck, Alison; Pires-Yfantouda, Renata; Docherty, Mary Jane; Sevdalis, Nick",Implement Sci Commun,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43058-021-00128-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33627195/,636

We aimed to study COVID-19 knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among medical and health sciences students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We performed a cross-sectional study between 2 June and 19 August 2020. The survey was distributed online using Survey Monkey. It was conducted in English and comprised two parts: socio-demographic characteristics, and KAP towards COVID-19. 712 responses to the questionnaire were collected. 90% of respondents (n = 695) were undergraduate students, while 10% (n = 81) were postgraduates. The majority (87%, n = 647) stated that they obtained COVID-19 information from multiple reliable sources. They were highly knowledgeable about the COVID-19 pandemic, but 76% (n = 539) did not recognize its routes of transmission. Medical students were significantly more knowledgeable compared with allied health students (P<0.0001, Mann Whitney U test) but there was no difference in knowledge between undergraduate and postgraduate students (P = 0.14, Mann Whitney U test). Medical students thought that more could be done to mitigate the COVID-19 situation compared with the allied health students (66.2% compared with 51.6%, p = 0.002 Fisher’s Exact test). 63% (n = 431) were worried about getting COVID-19 infection, while 92% (n = 633)) were worried that a family member could be infected with the virus. 97% (n = 655) took precautions when accepting home deliveries, 94% (n = 637) had been washing their hands more frequently, and 95% (n = 643) had been wearing face masks. In conclusion, medical and health sciences students in the UAE showed high levels of knowledge and good attitudes and practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, they were worried about themselves or their family members becoming infected. Medical students had more knowledge about COVID-19 pandemic which was reflected in their opinion that more can be done to mitigate its effects.","Baniyas, Noura; Sheek-Hussein, Mohamud; Al Kaabi, Nouf; Al Shamsi, Maitha; Al Neyadi, Maitha; Al Khoori, Rauda; Ajab, Suad; Abid, Muhammad; Grivna, Michal; Abu-Zidan, Fikri M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33979340/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246226,636

RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have higher gene mutations than DNA viruses during virus replication. Variations in SARS-CoV-2 genome could contribute to efficiency of viral spread and severity of COVID-19. In this study, we analyzed the locations of genomic mutations to investigate the genetic diversity among isolates of SARS-CoV-2 in Gwangju. We detected non-synonymous and frameshift mutations in various parts of SARS-CoV-2 genome. The phylogenetic analysis for whole genome showed that SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Gwangju isolates are clustered within clade V and G.

The French guidelines,2020-04-26,"Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay is widely utilized in serologic assays, including COVID‐19, for the detection and quantification of antibodies against SARS‐CoV‐2. However, due to the limited stability of the diagnostic reagents (e.g., antigens serving as biorecognition elements) and biospecimens, temperature‐controlled storage and handling conditions are critical. This limitation among others makes biodiagnostics in resource‐limited settings, where refrigeration and electricity are inaccessible or unreliable, particularly challenging. In this work, metal–organic framework encapsulation is demonstrated as a simple and effective method to preserve the conformational epitopes of antigens immobilized on microtiter plate under non‐refrigerated storage conditions. It is demonstrated that in situ growth of zeolitic imidazolate framework‐90 (ZIF‐90) renders excellent stability to surface‐bound SARS‐CoV‐2 antigens, thereby maintaining the assay performance under elevated temperature (40 °C) for up to 4 weeks. As a complementary method, the preservation of plasma samples from COVID‐19 patients using ZIF‐90 encapsulation is also demonstrated. The energy‐efficient approach demonstrated here will not only alleviate the financial burden associated with cold‐chain transportation, but also improve the disease surveillance in resource‐limited settings with more reliable clinical data.","Wang, Yixuan; Wang, Zheyu; Gupta, Prashant; Morrissey, Jeremiah J.; Naik, Rajesh R.; Singamaneni, Srikanth",Adv Healthc Mater,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34297470/; https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202100410,636
656621,Surviving and Thriving: Early Intervention for Neonatal Survivors With Developmental Disability in Uganda,2020-11-20,"Abstract Many viruses use the enteric tract as a route of entry to the human, animal or avian host. The onset of acute enteritis is associated with infection by viruses that replicate at or near the site of entry into the intestinal mucosa, including caliciviruses, rotaviruses, adenoviruses, astroviruses, and coronaviruses. These ‘enteric’ viruses occur globally and share similar features. Most are RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of mature absorptive epithelial cells lining the villi of the small intestine, leading to inflammation and villus atrophy. Vomiting and diarrhea can result in dehydration and death if untreated. Despite abundant growth in vivo, they initially proved difficult or impossible to grow in vitro. Most are genetically diverse, species specific, highly infectious within species and transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Severe symptoms are most commonly associated with primary infections of young animals, and are followed by short-lived immunity. Reinfections are common throughout life, but are often only mildly symptomatic. Safe and effective vaccines have been developed to prevent severe rotavirus disease in young children. In addition to these enterotropic viruses, enteric disease can also result from spread to the intestine of HIV or cytomegaloviruses during the later stages of systemic disease in immunocompromised hosts.","Bishop, R.

657495,Recommendations for medical care of oncological patients during the COVID-19 epidemic: experiences from China,2020-05-12,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Infection by the SARS-CoV-2 increases the risk for systematic multi-organ complications and venous, arterial thromboembolism. The need for an effective vaccine to combat the pandemic prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve a nationwide distribution of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine manufactured by Johnson & Johnson (J&J). The use of the vaccine was halted after reported cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and thrombocytopenia among recipients. Researchers have postulated these rare occurrences as potentially immune-triggered responses associated with complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Thrombotic complications and thrombocytopenia increase the risk for blood clot growth due to the inflammation of immune complexes by pro-thrombotic activation of anti-platelet antibodies. A 52-year-old man presented to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe dyspnea. He required bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) for supplemental oxygen therapy. Endotracheal intubation was performed due to his worsened respiratory deterioration. Lab results suggested respiratory failure due to decreased partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2)) and increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)). Findings of elevated D‐dimer levels with decreased fibrinogen and thrombocytopenia with prolonged prothrombin clotting time were consistent for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Chest radiography displayed moderate to heavy bilateral airspace consolidations, consistent with multifocal pneumonia suspicious for COVID-19. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) revealed a mildly enlarged right ventricle and interventricular septum consistent for right heart strain due to a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE) that extended into the main pulmonary lobar segmental arteries bilaterally. The patient was transferred to a higher-level (tertiary) care for radiology intervention to remove the pulmonary embolism found on his lungs. This patient presented with severe dyspnea secondary to massive PE and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) due to SARS-CoV2 infection following the administration of the J&J vaccine. Bilateral thrombus opacities and pulmonary emboli are consistent among COVID-19 patients by intravascular coagulation with increased prothrombin time and D-dimer concentration with a low platelet count. Adverse emboli growths with increased D-dimer and thrombocytopenia strikes a similarity in recipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine due to vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Administrative use of the J&J vaccine resumed in May 2021. The FDA's reassurance stemmed from their conclusive findings that the vaccine's benefits far outweigh these rare developments, which account for less than 0.01% of the total recipient population. Nevertheless, a further detailed analysis must be conducted on the adverse thrombotic manifestations following adenoviral-based COVID-19 vaccines (J&J, AstraZeneca) compared to mRNA-based vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer) to assess causality with higher specificity.","Shazley, Omar; Alshazley, Moudar",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34408937/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16383,636

COVID‐19 is associated with variable morbidity and mortality rates, which differ greatly from one country to another. This study aimed to investigate the clinical findings of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in different ethnic groups, as well as to identify the radiological manifestations and various biomarkers for the assessment of COVID‐19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical data of 210 COVID‐19 patients with respiratory disorders, who attended the chest clinic at Mouwasat Hospital, Jubail, in the Eastern area of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from April to May 2020, were thoroughly reviewed. The patients were divided into seven groups based on their ethnicities (Saudi, Egyptian, Nepali, Filipino, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Indian). The differences in the clinical findings, laboratory data and radiological manifestations between these groups were statistically analysed. RESULTS: The study included 210 COVID‐19 patients from seven ethnic groups (Saudi, Egyptian, Nepali, Filipino, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Indian). Comorbidities were reported among 60.9% of patients, which were significantly higher among Filipinos at 73.3%. Dyspnoea was prevalent in the Saudi and Pakistani groups, while hypoxaemia was prevalent in the Indian group (40%). In terms of laboratory assessment, Bangladesh patients had the highest median of serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels with a significant P value (<.001), while Saudi patients had the highest median of C‐reactive protein (CRP) levels with a significant P value (<.001). According to computed tomography (CT) findings, structural destruction was the most common finding in bilateral parenchymal affection among 88.6% of patients. Filipinos and Bangladeshis had the highest morbidity rates. CONCLUSION: There were great variations in clinical, radiological and even laboratory findings among different ethnic groups of COVID‐19 patients.","Ahmed, Randa I.; Khalil, Mahmoud A.

658361,The Psychology of Human Behavior During a Pandemic,2020-07-14,"Vaccines, when available, will likely become our best tool to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Even in the most optimistic scenarios, vaccine shortages will likely occur. Using an age-stratified mathematical model paired with optimization algorithms, we determined optimal vaccine allocation for four different metrics (deaths, symptomatic infections, and maximum non-ICU and ICU hospitalizations) under many scenarios. We find that a vaccine with effectiveness ≥50% would be enough to substantially mitigate the ongoing pandemic, provided that a high percentage of the population is optimally vaccinated. When minimizing deaths, we find that for low vaccine effectiveness, irrespective of vaccination coverage, it is optimal to allocate vaccine to high-risk (older) age groups first. In contrast, for higher vaccine effectiveness, there is a switch to allocate vaccine to high-transmission (younger) age groups first for high vaccination coverage. While there are other societal and ethical considerations, this work can provide an evidence-based rationale for vaccine prioritization.","Matrajt, Laura; Eaton, Julia; Leung, Tiffany; Brown, Elizabeth R.",Sci Adv,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abf1374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33536223/,636
658389,Utility of Social Media for Recruitment by Orthopaedic Surgery Residency Programs,2021-09-08,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) highlights the global health emergency. To limit the rate of COVID-19 transmission to health care workers, adequate personal protective equipment's (PPE's) are required. Emerging reports indicate that the widespread usage of PPE during the COVID-19 outbreak has exacerbated plastic contamination in the ocean. PURPOSE: This paper attempts to understand the influence of practice, benefits, and impact of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 crisis on clean water sanitation, life below water, and life on land (SDGs 6, 14, and 15 respectively) in Fiji and assess the effectiveness of measurements taken to deal with this crisis. Fiji is a small Pacific Island Country (PIC) and the global crisis of COVID-19 entered the Fijian border on 19th, March 2020. Sadly, the second wave of COVID-19 was reported on 18th, April 2021, which began at a managed quarantine facility after contact between a couple returning from India to Fiji and a soldier. Since then the number of cases have been increasing daily and posing a risk to the public. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A personal observations were made to collect the PPE pollution on the streets, near roads, car parks, markets, and towns. RESULTS: The widespread PPE pollution was noticed, the common PPE found in the Vesivesi road of Suva, Fiji was facemask (61.36%) and hand gloves (38.64%), as it is mostly used by the general public, police offices, municipal waste management, shopping malls works, and medical care workers. Face shield littering was limited due to fewer users. CONCLUSIONS: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this study stresses a great concern on enabling SDGs 6, 14, and 15 and how the use of PPEs during COVID-19 has impacted the natural environment. It is critical to remember that managing PPE waste during a contagious pandemic should be treated as an emergency and handled quickly.","Chand, Aneesh A.; Lal, Prashant P.; Prasad, Kushal A.; Mamun, Kabir A.",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080121007135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34462651/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102763; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080121007135?v=s5,636

We report monthly mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department (ED) visit incidence rates (IRs) during 2010-2020 to provide context for COVID-19 vaccine safety assessments. Methods We observed outcomes among all NH residents in Ontario using administrative databases. IRs were calculated by month, sex, and age group. Comparisons between months were assessed using one-sample t-tests; comparisons by age and sex were assessed using chi-squared tests. Results From 2010-2019, there were 83,453 (SD: 652.4) NH residents per month, with an average of 2.3 (SD: 0.28) deaths, 3.1 (SD: 0.16) hospitalizations, and 3.6 (SD: 0.17) ED visits per 100 residents per month. From March to December 2020, mortality IRs were increased, but hospitalization and ED visit IRs were reduced (p<0.05).

659029,United States COVID-19 Vaccination Preferences (CVP): 2020 Hindsight,2021-03-30,"OBJECTIVES Ensuring access to care for all patients-especially those with life-threatening and chronic conditions-during a pandemic is a challenge for all healthcare systems. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries faced excess mortality partly attributed to disruptions in essential healthcare services provision. This study aims to estimate the utilization of public primary care and hospital services during the COVID-19 epidemic in Greece and its potential association with excess non-COVID-19 mortality in the country. STUDY DESIGN This is an observational study. METHODS A retrospective analysis of national secondary utilization and mortality data from multiple official sources, covering the first nine months of the COVID-19 epidemic in Greece (February 26th to November 30th, 2020), was carried out. RESULTS Utilization rates of all public healthcare services during the first nine months of the epidemic dropped significantly compared to the average utilization rates of the 2017-19 control period; hospital admissions, hospital surgical procedures, and primary care visits dropped by 17.3% (95% CI: 6.6%-28.0%), 23.1% (95% CI: 7.3%-38.9%), and 24.8% (95% CI: 13.3%-36.3%) respectively. This underutilization of essential public services-mainly due to supply restrictions such as suspension of outpatient care and cancelation of elective surgeries-is most probably related to the 3778 excess non-COVID-19 deaths (representing 62% of all-cause excess deaths) that have been reported during the first 9 months of the epidemic in the country. CONCLUSIONS Greece's healthcare system, deeply wounded by the 2008-18 recession and austerity, was ill-resourced to cope with the challenges of the COVID-19 epidemic. Early and prolonged lockdowns have kept COVID-19 infections and deaths at relatively low levels. However, this ""success"" seems to have been accomplished at the expense of non-COVID-19 patients. It is important to acknowledge the ""hidden epidemic"" of unmet non-COVID-19 needs and increased non-COVID-19 deaths in the country and urgently strengthen public healthcare services to address it.","Kondilis, E; Tarantilis, F; Benos, A",Public health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34365111/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.06.025,636
659447,Alone With the Kids: Tele-Medicine for Children With Special Healthcare Needs During COVID-19 Emergency,2020-09-09,"It is known that virtual reality (VR) experience may cause cyber sickness. One aspect of VR is an immersion or otherwise sense of presence, the sense of feeling oneself in a virtual world. In this paper an experiment which was conducted in order to find the link between level of immersion and cyber sickness felt by participants is presented. Eighty-nine participants aged between 19 and 36 years have been equally divided into four groups with different level of VR immersion. The low-immersive group was represented by PC with monoscopic screen, the semi-immersive group was represented by CAVE with stereoscopic projector, the fully immersive group was represented by VR head-mounted display, and the last group was the control group without any kind of immersion. The task for the participants was to navigate through the maze for a specified amount of time (10 min). The Simulator Sickness Questionnaire was used as a subjective measure tool for cyber sickness level and Grooved Pegboard Test for assessing the fine dexterity, both before and after the experiment. Regarding the time spend in VR the fully immersive environment had the biggest problems as more than half of the participants had to stop before 10 min (p < 0.001). Concerning the cyber sickness, the significant increase in nausea score between pre-test and post-test scores has been observed in semi-immersive group (p = 0.0018) and fully immersive group (p < 0.0001). The increase in oculomotor score was smaller. The significant difference was noted only in fully immersive group (p = 0.0449). In spite of great nausea factor after the VR immersion the participants did not show a decrease of fine dexterity in any group (p < 0.001).","Martirosov, Sergo; Bureš, Marek; Zítka, Tomáš",Virtual Real,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10055-021-00507-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34025203/,636

Here, we examine the impact of mandated, city‐wide social distancing orders aimed at limiting the spread of COVID‐19 on gang‐related crime in Los Angeles. We hypothesize that the unique subcultural processes surrounding gangs may supersede calls to shelter in place and allow gang‐related crime to persist. If the normal guardianship of people and property is also disrupted by social distancing, then we expect gang violence to increase. Using autoregressive time series models, we show that gang‐related crime remained stable and crime hot spots largely stationary following the onset of shelter in place. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: In responding to disruptions to social and economic life on the scale of the present pandemic, both police and civilian organizations need to anticipate continued demand, all while managing potential reductions to workforce. Police are faced with this challenge across a wide array of crime types. Civilian interventionists tasked with responding to gang‐related crime need to be prepared for continued peacekeeping and violence interruption activities, but also an expansion of responsibilities to deal with “frontline” or “street‐level” management of public health needs.","Jeffrey Brantingham, Paul; Tita, George E.; Mohler, George",Criminol Public Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230818/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9133.12541,636
660469,Exergy intensity and environmental consequences of the medical face masks curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic: Malign bodyguard?,2021-09-01,"Plant stress detection is considered one of the most critical areas for the improvement of crop yield in the compelling worldwide scenario, dictated by both the climate change and the geopolitical consequences of the Covid-19 epidemics. A complicated interconnection of biotic and abiotic stressors affect plant growth, including water, salt, temperature, light exposure, nutrients availability, agrochemicals, air and soil pollutants, pests and diseases. In facing this extended panorama, the technology choice is manifold. On the one hand, quantitative methods, such as metabolomics, provide very sensitive indicators of most of the stressors, with the drawback of a disruptive approach, which prevents follow up and dynamical studies. On the other hand qualitative methods, such as fluorescence, thermography and VIS/NIR reflectance, provide a non-disruptive view of the action of the stressors in plants, even across large fields, with the drawback of a poor accuracy. When looking at the spatial scale, the effect of stress may imply modifications from DNA level (nanometers) up to cell (micrometers), full plant (millimeters to meters), and entire field (kilometers). While quantitative techniques are sensitive to the smallest scales, only qualitative approaches can be used for the larger ones. Emerging technologies from nuclear and medical physics, such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, are expected to bridge the gap of quantitative non-disruptive morphologic and functional measurements at larger scale. In this review we analyze the landscape of the different technologies nowadays available, showing the benefits of each approach in plant stress detection, with a particular focus on the gaps, which will be filled in the nearby future by the emerging nuclear physics approaches to agriculture.","Galieni, Angelica; D'Ascenzo, Nicola; Stagnari, Fabio; Pagnani, Giancarlo; Xie, Qingguo; Pisante, Michele",Front Plant Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584752/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2020.609155,636

The EnerPol platform has been used in a broad range of case studies in different sectors in all of Europe, USA, Japan, South Korea and sub Saharan Africa over the last 10 years. In the present study, the entire Swiss population (8.57 million people), including cross-border commuters, and the entire Swiss public and private transport network that is simulated to assess transmission of the COVID-19 virus. The individual contacts within the population, and possible transmission pathways, are established from a simulation of daily activities that are calibrated with micro-census data. Various governmental interventions with regards to closures and social distancing are also implemented. The epidemiology of the COVID-19 virus is based on publicly available statistical data and adapted to Swiss demographics. The predictions estimate that between 22 February and 11 April 2020, there will be 720 deaths from 83300 COVID-19 cases, and 73300 will have recovered; our preliminary variability in these estimates is about 21% over the aforementioned period. In the absence of governmental intervention, 42.7% of the Swiss population would have been infected by 25 April 2020 compared to our prediction of a 1% infection over this time period, saving thousands of lives. It is argued that future scenarios regarding relaxation of the lockdown should be carefully simulated, as by 19 April 2020, there will still remain a substantial number of infected individuals, who could retrigger a second spread of COVID-19. Through the use of a digital tool, such as Enerpol, to evaluate in a data-driven manner the impacts of various policy scenarios, the most effective measures to mitigate a spread of COVID-19 can be devised while we await the deployment of large-scale vaccination for the population globally. By tailoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of the spread to match the capacity of local healthcare facilities, appropriate logistic needs can be determined, in order not to overwhelm the health care services across the country.","Abhari, Reza S.; Marini, Marcello; Chokani, Ndaona",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047472,636

Results suggest that ultracentrifugation of a small volume of wastewater through a 50% sucrose cushion followed by total nucleic acid extraction yielded quantifiable virus in an area with a modest number of COVID-19 cases. Further, the ratio of log10(SARS-CoV-2):log10(crAssphage) appears to be associated with the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the Syracuse, NY area.

Results showed that the variations in meteorological conditions led to a national PM2.5 concentration decreased of 1.7% from 2020-01 to 2020-03, whereas it increased by 1.6% in January and decreased by 1.3% and 7.9% in February and March, respectively. The reduction of pollutants emissions led to a decrease of 14.1% in national PM2.5 concentration during the first quarter of 2020 and a decrease of 4.0%, 25.7%, and 15.0% in January, February, and March, respectively. Compared to the same period last year, the PM2.5 concentration measured in Wuhan City decreased more than in the entire country. This was caused by improved meteorological conditions and a higher reduction of pollutant emissions in Wuhan City. PM2.5 in Beijing increased annually before the epidemic outbreak and during the strict control period, mainly due to unfavorable meteorological conditions. However, the decrease in PM2.5 in Beijing compared to March 2019 was closely related to the substantial reduction of emissions. The measured PM2.5 in the ""2+26"" cities, the Fenwei Plain and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) decreased during the first quarter of 2020, with the largest drop occurring in the Yangtze River Delta due to higher YRD emissions reductions. The meteorological conditions of ""2+26"" cities and Fenwei Plain were unfavorable before the epidemic outbreak and greatly improved during the strict control period, whereas the Yangtze River Delta had the most favorable meteorological conditions in March.

At present, there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Liu Shen capsule (LS), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been proven to have a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immunomodulatory activities. However, little is known about the antiviral effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2. Herein, the study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential effect in regulating the host’s immune response. The inhibitory effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells was evaluated by using the cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque reduction assay. The number of virions of SARS-CoV-2 was observed under transmission electron microscope after treatment with LS. Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. The results showed that LS could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, and reduce the number of virus particles and it could markedly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels. Moreover, the expression of the key proteins in the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway was detected by western blot and it was found that LS could inhibit the expression of p-NF-κB p65, p-IκBα and p-p38 MAPK, while increasing the expression of IκBα. These findings indicate that LS could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection via downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced virus and regulating the activity of NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway in vitro, making its promising candidate treatment for controlling COVID-19 disease.","Ma, Qinhai; Pan, Weiqi; Li, Runfeng; Liu, Bin; Li, Chufang; Xie, Yuqi; Wang, Zhoulang; Zhao, Jin; Jiang, Haiming; Huang, Jicheng; Shi, Yongxia; Dai, Jun; Zheng, Kui; Li, Xiaobo; Yang, Zifeng",Pharmacol Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661820311580?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360580/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104850; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043661820311580,636

However, the current literature has a limited understanding of the implications of employees' obligated home‐based telework and their satisfaction with the work and home domains. We use boundary theory to examine work and home boundary violations in relation to satisfaction with domain investment in two daily diary studies, examining both domain‐specific and cross‐domain effects. In addition, we examine the moderating role of segmentation preferences in both studies and investigate the mediating role of work‐ and home‐related unfinished tasks in Study 2. Both studies provide empirical evidence of the domain‐specific relationship between boundary violations and domain satisfaction and provide limited support for cross‐domain effects. Neither study finds support for the notion that segmentation preferences moderate the relationship between boundary violations and domain satisfaction. Finally, the results of Study 2 highlight the importance of unfinished tasks in the relationship between boundary violations and domain satisfaction. Specifically, work and home boundary violations relate to an increase in unfinished tasks in both domains. Finally, the indirect effects suggest that home‐related unfinished tasks may be detrimental to satisfaction in both domains, while work‐related unfinished tasks may be detrimental for work‐related, but not home‐related, satisfaction.","Kerman, Katja; Korunka, Christian; Tement, Sara",Appl Psychol,https://doi.org/10.1111/apps.12335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548734/,636

Although these exacerbations are associated with several types of viruses, human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are associated with the vast majority of disease exacerbations. Due to the lack of an animal species that is naturally permissive for HRVs to use as a facile model system, and the limitations associated with animal models of asthma and COPD, studies of controlled experimental infection of humans with HRVs have been used and conducted safely for decades. This review discusses how these experimental infection studies with HRVs have provided a means of understanding the pathophysiology underlying virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and COPD with the goal of developing agents for their prevention and treatment.","Del Vecchio, Alfred M.; Branigan, Patrick J.; Barnathan, Elliot S.; Flavin, Susan K.; Silkoff, Philip E.; Turner, Ronald B.",Pulm Pharmacol Ther,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1094553914001321; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pupt.2014.10.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25445932/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094553914001321,636

This study employed survey data gathered by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health from adult inpatients at somatic hospitals in the Health South-East RHF in Norway. The survey engaged 4603 patients out of 8381 from five main hospitals in the region. The study found that an eight-factor model of the PEQ generally showed good fitness to the data, but assessment of discriminant validity showed that this was not the optimal factor solution among four of the eight dimensions. After comparing models, the study proposed a model with a second-order factor for four of the factors: “nurse services”, “doctor services”, “information”, and “organization”, collectively named “treatment services”. The proposed model demonstrated good validity and reliability results. The results present theoretical and practical implications. The study recommends that inferential analyses on the PEQ should be done with the second-order factor. Furthermore, a revision of the PEQ is recommended subject to more confirmatory studies with larger samples in different regions. The study indicates a second-order factor structure for assessing and understanding patient experiences—a finding which has both theoretical and managerial implications.","Addo, Seth Ayisi; Mykletun, Reidar Johan; Olsen, Espen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34281076/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18137141,636

With the disease spreading faster than the medical community could contain it, death tolls increased at an alarming rate worldwide, causing the World Health Organization to officially sanction the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a pandemic, leading to a state of worldwide lockdown for the majority of the year 2020. There have been reports of new strains of the virus emerging in various parts of the world, with some strains displaying even greater infectivity and transmissibility. Areas of the emerging variant of concern arise from countries like the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, and India. These mutations carry a lineage from N501Y, D614G, N439K, Y453F, and others, which are globally dominated by clades 20A, 20B, and 20C.

663743,Association of the US COVID-19 Pandemic and Attenuated Influenza Detection,2021-06-01,"Publisher Summary Pulmonary pathology includes a large spectrum of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases that affect the lung. Many of these are a result of the unusual relationship of the lung with the outside world. Every breath that a human takes brings the outside world into the body in the form of infectious agents, organic and inorganic particles, and noxious agents of all types. Although the lung has many defense mechanisms to protect itself from these insults, these are not infallible; therefore, lung pathology arises. Damage to the lung is particularly important given the role of the lung in the survival of the organism. Any impairment of lung function has widespread effects throughout the body, since all organs depend on the lungs for the oxygen they need. Pulmonary pathology catalogs the changes in the lung tissues and the mechanisms through which these occur. This chapter presents a review of lung pathology and the current state of knowledge about the pathogenesis of each disease. It suggests that a clear understanding of both morphology and mechanism is required for the development of new therapies and preventive measures.","Farver, Carol F.; Zander, Dani S.",Molecular Pathology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123744197000184; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123744197000184,636
663751,Purview of 3D printing in medical applications during COVID-19,2020-12-10,"BACKGROUND: Secure forensic mental health services treat patients with high rates of treatment-resistant psychoses. High rates of obesity and medical comorbidities are common. Population-based studies have identified high-risk groups in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those with problems such as obesity, lung disease and immune-compromising conditions. Structured assessment tools exist to ascertain the risk of adverse outcome in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection. AIMS: To assess risk of adverse outcome in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a complete population of forensic psychiatry patients using structured assessment tools. METHOD: All patients of a national forensic mental health service (n = 141) were rated for risk of adverse outcome in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection, using two structured tools, the COVID-Age tool and the COVID-Risk tool. RESULTS: We found high rates of relevant physical comorbidities. Mean chronological age was 45.5 years (s.d. = 11.4, median 44.1), mean score on the COVID-Age tool was 59.1 years (s.d. = 19.4, median 58.0), mean difference was 13.6 years (s.d. = 15.6), paired t = 10.9, d.f. = 140, P < 0.001. Three patients (2.1%) were chronologically over 70 years of age, compared with 43 (30.5%) with a COVID-Age over 70 (χ(2) = 6.99, d.f. = 1, P = 0.008, Fisher's exact test P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Patients in secure forensic psychiatric services represent a high-risk group for adverse outcomes in the event of SARS-COV-2 infection. Population-based guidance on self-isolation and other precautions based on chronological age may not be sufficient.

No fever, URI sx, vomiting/diarrhea. His dad had URI symptoms and fever a week prior. He was found to have T=95.5F, glucose <10 mg/dL, improved to 125 after D10 boluses x2; and required supplemental O2 due to desats/cyanosis. CXR showed bilateral hazy opacities. Sepsis rule out was initiated, patient admitted to the PICU, started on antibiotics and dextrose. Patient became more alert over the next 3 days, but could not be weaned off from IV dextrose/continuous feeds, GIR up to 15 mg/kg/min. He was transferred to our institution. Critical sample at BG of 45 mg/dl showed high insulin level (6.9 uU/ml) and C-peptide (1.25 ng/dl); low beta-OH butyrate <0.2 mmol/L; and free fatty acids (0.25 mmol/L); all suggestive of hyerperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH). Cortisol and GH robust at 10.5 mcg/dl and 7.13 ng/ml. Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive. Dad’s swab also positive. Mom was asymptomatic and not tested. ID was consulted, recommended supportive management and close observation. Pt was started on Diazoxide 10mg/kg/day divided q8h, and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) 5mg/day. Patient’s status gradually improved - BG stabilized, feeds were compressed, IV fluids and O2 supplementation weaned off, and was discharged after 8 days with average BG in the 70-80’s range. Diazoxide and HCT were successfully weaned off in the following 3 mos. To this day patient remains well, no recurrence of hypoglycemia. Discussion/Conclusion: There is a dearth of information on SARS-CoV-2 infection in newborns. The few studies available show favorable outcomes in this population, with typical mild-moderate respiratory symptoms and fever, while some newborns are asymptomatic. Our patient required oxygen tx and developed HH requiring Diazoxide therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of HH in the newborn with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hyerperinsulinism is the most common cause of hypoglycemia in infants. These newborns are at risk of developing significant neurologic morbidity, which can be dose dependent. Prompt diagnosis and aggressive management are important to reduce such risk. Perinatal stress is likely the underlying mechanism leading to HH in newborns with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patient is also SGA. Both perinatal stress and SGA can lead to inappropriately elevated insulin levels and resultant hypoglycemia. HH in both of these conditions is effectively managed by Diazoxide. Our case illustrates that although most newborns do well with SARS-CoV-2 infection, a high index of suspicion for HH should be maintained in such newborns, particularly in those with at least one other risk factor for HH such as SGA. More studies are needed to elucidate underlying pathology and tease out actual incidence of hypoglycemia in neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Paulo, Remberto; Bowlby, Deborah A; Matlock, Kristal Anne",J Endocr Soc,https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvab048.1412,636
664378,"A Perfect Storm? Health Anxiety, Contamination Fears, and COVID-19: Lessons Learned from Past Pandemics and Current Challenges",2021-04-22,"Speech understanding in noise is poorer in bilateral cochlear-implant (BICI) users compared to normal-hearing counterparts. Independent automatic gain controls (AGCs) may contribute to this because adjusting processor gain independently can reduce interaural level differences that BICI listeners rely on for bilateral benefits. Bilaterally linked AGCs may improve bilateral benefits by increasing the magnitude of interaural level differences. The effects of linked AGCs on bilateral benefits (summation, head shadow, and squelch) were measured in nine BICI users. Speech understanding for a target talker at 0° masked by a single talker at 0°, 90°, or −90° azimuth was assessed under headphones with sentences at five target-to-masker ratios. Research processors were used to manipulate AGC type (independent or linked) and test ear (left, right, or both). Sentence recall was measured in quiet to quantify individual interaural asymmetry in functional performance. The results showed that AGC type did not significantly change performance or bilateral benefits. Interaural functional asymmetries, however, interacted with ear such that greater summation and squelch benefit occurred when there was larger functional asymmetry, and interacted with interferer location such that smaller head shadow benefit occurred when there was larger functional asymmetry. The larger benefits for those with larger asymmetry were driven by improvements from adding a better-performing ear, rather than a true binaural-hearing benefit. In summary, linked AGCs did not significantly change bilateral benefits in cases of speech-on-speech masking with a single-talker masker, but there was also no strong detriment across a range of target-to-masker ratios, within a small and diverse BICI listener population.","Bakal, Taylor A.; Milvae, Kristina DeRoy; Chen, Chen; Goupell, Matthew J.",Trends Hear,https://doi.org/10.1177/23312165211018147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34057387/,636

A cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate medical and dental students of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Four hundred and twenty students who attended anatomy classes during COVID-19 outbreak in Greece, were asked to fill in a questionnaire of 22 questions evaluating the formats of the different courses provided. Each student was asked to complete the questionnaire anonymously via the Google Forms(®) platform. A total of 200 students participated. During the lockdown, 59.5% of students attended all online anatomy lectures compared to 44.5% in the pre-pandemic year. Overall, the higher percentage of 73.5% was satisfied with the traditional anatomy teaching, instead of 56% which were satisfied with the effectiveness of online anatomy lectures. Asking whether any remote educational method can partially or completely replace the traditional anatomy teaching, the majority of students replied “no” for all the three remote modalities. The traditional anatomy teaching remains the most preferred and effective teaching modality. The students ranked online anatomy lectures and pre-recorded anatomy lectures in second place in terms of effectiveness and preference. The development of remote learning methods has increased students’ active participation in anatomy lessons, but significantly negatively affected the students’ performance at exams. Remote learning cannot replace the traditional anatomy teaching method, but online lectures could be incorporated into anatomy curricula as an additional tool.","Totlis, Trifon; Tishukov, Maksim; Piagkou, Maria; Kostares, Michael; Natsis, Konstantinos",Anat Cell Biol,https://doi.org/10.5115/acb.21.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34031272/,636

666153,Therapeutic Factors and Member Satisfaction in an Online Group Intervention During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-09-26,"BACKGROUND: Over recent decades, CT scans have become routinely available and are used in both acute medical and outpatient environments. However, there is a small increase in the risk of adverse consequences, including an increase in the risk of both malignancy and cataracts. Clinicians are often unaware of these facts, and this represents a challenge for medical educators in England, where almost 5 million CT scans are done annually. New whiteboard methodologies permit development of innovative educational tools that are efficient and scalable in communicating simple educational messages that promote patient safety. METHODS: A short educational whiteboard cartoon was developed to explore the prior observation that adolescents under the care of paediatricians had a much lower risk of receiving a CT scan than those under the care of clinicians who care for adults. This explored the risks after receiving a CT scan and strategies that can be used to avoid them. The educational cartoon was piloted on new doctors who were attending induction training at a busy teaching hospital. RESULTS: The main output was the educational whiteboard cartoon itself. Before the new medical trainees’ induction, 56% (25/45) had received no formal training in radiation awareness, and this decreased to 26% (6/23) after the exposure to the educational cartoon (p=0.02). At baseline, 60% (27/45) of respondents considered that young females were at highest risk from exposure to ionising radiation, and this increased to 87% (20/23) after exposure to the educational cartoon (p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept feasibility study demonstrates that whiteboard cartoons provide a novel and feasible approach to efficiently promote patient safety issues, where a short succinct message is often appropriate.","Thurley, Pete; Bowker, Richard; Bhatti, Imran; Skelly, Rob; Law, Russ; Salaman, Rachel; Young, Ben; Fogarty, Andrew",BMJ Open Qual,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2019-000900; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33246934/,636

Forty-eight clinical and laboratory features were screened with LASSO method. Further multi-tree extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning-based model was used to rank importance of features selected from LASSO and subsequently constructed death risk prediction model with simple-tree XGBoost model. Performances of models were evaluated by AUC, prediction accuracy, precision, and F1 scores. RESULTS: Six features, including disease severity, age, levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and interleukin-10 (IL-10), were selected as predictors for COVID-19 mortality. Simple-tree XGBoost model conducted by these features can predict death risk accurately with >90% precision and >85% sensitivity, as well as F1 scores >0.90 in training and validation sets.

At each hospital, transmission was linked to a unique index case. Moreover, 4 cases were associated with superspreading events (any interaction where a case patient transmitted to ≥5 subsequent case patients). All 4 of these patients were severely ill, were initially not recognized as MERS-CoV cases, and subsequently died. Genomic sequences clustered separately, suggesting 2 distinct outbreaks. Overall, 4 (24%) of 17 HCP cases and 3 (3%) of 114 HCP contacts of cases were seropositive. CONCLUSIONS: We describe 2 distinct healthcare-associated outbreaks, each initiated by a unique index case and characterized by multiple superspreading events. Delays in recognition and in subsequent implementation of control measures contributed to secondary transmission. Prompt contact tracing, repeated testing, HCP furloughing, and implementation of recommended transmission-based precautions for suspected cases ultimately halted transmission.","Alanazi, Khalid H.; Killerby, Marie E.; Biggs, Holly M.; Abedi, Glen R.; Jokhdar, Hani; Alsharef, Ali A.; Mohammed, Mutaz; Abdalla, Osman; Almari, Aref; Bereagesh, Samar; Tawfik, Sameh; Alresheedi, Husain; Alhakeem, Raafat F.; Hakawi, Ahmed; Alfalah, Haitham; Amer, Hala; Thornburg, Natalie J.; Tamin, Azaibi; Trivedi, Suvang; Tong, Suxiang; Lu, Xiaoyan; Queen, Krista; Li, Yan; Sakthivel, Senthilkumar K.; Tao, Ying; Zhang, Jing; Paden, Clinton R.; Al-Abdely, Hail M.; Assiri, Abdullah M.; Gerber, Susan I.; Watson, John T.",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2018.290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30595141/,636
666765,Our Words in a State of Emergency: Psychological–Linguistic Analysis of Utterances on the COVID-19 Situation in the Czech Republic,2021-07-13,"The childhood obesity pandemic has emerged as an important public health problem in many countries. Obese children are likely to become obese adults, and adult obesity is associated with an increased risk of morbidity. Therefore, controlling the childhood obesity epidemic has become a top public health priority worldwide. The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may significantly impede this important mission and constitute an unprecedented tragedy in the global battle against childhood obesity. This manuscript presents evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic will aggravate the childhood obesity epidemic and lead to significant weight gain in school children by creating an unprecedented obesogenic environment. Within the last few months, many countries took uncompromising measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including school closures and quarantine. While these steps are often necessary to ensure infection control, they may have a significant negative effect on children's mental and physical health. Physical, nutritional, and psychosocial factors that promote obesity in children during this special situation complementarily contribute to an unprecedented obesogenic environment. Large-scale quarantine and home confinement will impose new and unfamiliar stressors on children, thereby worsening the childhood obesity epidemic. Most importantly, adverse childhood events resulting from a predicted increase in domestic violence within the next few months will significantly contribute to this concern. The scenario presented in this review is of paramount public health importance and must be considered during future pandemic planning. Involved stakeholders, including governments, schools, and families, must make all possible efforts to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on childhood obesity.","Storz, Maximilian Andreas",Clin Exp Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.3345/cep.2020.01081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33152743/,636

These events provided a unique lens through which to understand how the public reasons about real-world dilemmas involving trade-offs between human lives. In three studies (total N = 2298), we examined people's moral attitudes toward the triage of acute coronavirus patients, and found elevated support for utilitarian triage policies. These utilitarian tendencies did not stem from period change in moral attitudes relative to pre-pandemic levels-but rather, from the heightened realism of triage dilemmas. Participants favoured utilitarian resolutions of critical care dilemmas when compared to structurally analogous, non-medical dilemmas-and such support was rooted in prosocial dispositions, including empathy and impartial beneficence. Finally, despite abundant evidence of political polarisation surrounding Covid-19, moral views about critical care triage differed modestly, if at all, between liberals and conservatives. Taken together, our findings highlight people's robust support for utilitarian measures in the face of a global public health threat, and illustrate how the dominant methods in moral psychology (e.g. trolley cases) may deliver insights that do not generalise to real-world moral dilemmas.","Kneer, Markus; Hannikainen, Ivar R",Cogn Emot,https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2021.1964940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34392813/,636

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the number and the findings of FDG-PET/CT studies acquired between February and April 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic at the University of Napoli Federico II. The number and the findings of FDG-PET/CT studies acquired in the corresponding period of 2019 were also assessed for direct comparison. RESULTS: The number of FDG-PET/CT studies performed during the pandemic (n = 299) and in the corresponding period of 2019 (n = 335) were comparable. The percentage of abnormal FDG-PET/CT findings, suspicious for interstitial pneumonia by Covid-19 infection, was significantly higher during the pandemic (9%) compared with that found in the corresponding period of 2019 (4%) (χ(2) 5.45, P = 0.02). No significant differences were observed in the distribution of Covid-19 reporting and data system (CO-RADS) classification and in the maximum standardized uptake value between the pandemic (2.6 ± 2.2) and the corresponding period of 2019 (3.2 ± 1.4). Of note, patients with abnormal imaging findings during the pandemic time had clinical data and/or laboratory tests negative for Covid-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Despite the restrictive medical measures for the emergency, the number of FDG-PET/CT studies was unchanged during the pandemic compared with the previous year. Our findings also indicate that Covid-19 infection was contained in our series of patients from southern Italy.","Maurea, Simone; Mainolfi, Ciro Gabriele; Bombace, Claudia; Annunziata, Alessandra; Attanasio, Ludovica; Petretta, Mario; Del Vecchio, Silvana; Cuocolo, Alberto",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32572561/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-020-04931-7,636

Due to the potent spread of the virus and the scarcity of kits and supplies, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has granted authorisation for the use of kits available during this emergency, without an accurate evaluation of their performance. This study compared the performance and cost-effectiveness of seven molecular assays/kits available in São Paulo, Brazil, for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis Materials and Methods : A total of 205 nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples from suspected cases of COVID-19, were tested using the following assays: (i) GeneFinder COVID-19 plus RealAmp kit; (ii) 2019-nCoV RNA PCR-Fluorescence Probing, Da An Gene Co.; (iii) in-house RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 IAL; (iv) 2019-nCoV kit, IDT; (v) molecular SARS-CoV-2 (E) kit, Bio-Manguinhos; (vi) Allplex 2019-nCoV modified Assay, Seegene Inc, and (vii) Biomol one-step COVID-19 kit, IBMP. The criteria for determining a SARS-CoV-2 true positive result included the cycle threshold cut-off values, the characteristics of exponential/linear curves, the gene target diversity, and a positive result in at least two assays Results : The overall sensitivity of the assays listed were GeneFinder 83.6%, Da An Gene 100.0%, IAL 90.4%, IDT 94.6%, Bio-Manguinhos 87.7%, Allplex 97.3%, and IBMP 87.7%. The minor sensitive gene target was RdRP. Although all assays had a Cohen's Kappa index ≥0.893, the best tests used multiplex assays identifying N-gene and/or E-gene targets Conclusion : All assays tested accurate for diagnosis, but considering cost-effectiveness (cost, time consumption, number of samples tested, and performance), the in-house IAL assay was ideal for COVID-19 diagnosis in São Paulo, Brazil.","Sacchi, Cláudio Tavares; Gonçalves, Maria Gisele; Lemos, Ana Paula Silva; Almeida, Samanta Cristine Grassi; Caterino-de-Araujo, Adele; Fukasawa, Lucila Okuyama",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667038021000041; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667038021000041?v=s5,636
667753,"Combined measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, Hubei, China: A narrative review",2020-11-02,"INTRODUCTION: Urgent action is needed to fight the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic by reducing the number of infected people along with the infection contagiousness and severity. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), the prototype of typical antipsychotics from the phenothiazine group, is known to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and acts as an antiviral, in particular against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. The aim of this in vitro study was to test CPZ against a SARS-CoV-2 isolate in monkey and human cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Monkey VeroE6 cells and human alveolar basal epithelial A549-ACE2 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in presence of different concentrations of CPZ. Supernatants were harvested at day 2 and analysed by RT-qPCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Cell viability was assessed on non-infected cells. RESULTS: We evidenced an antiviral activity of CPZ against SARS-CoV-2 in monkey VeroE6 cells with an IC50 of 8.2 µM, a CC50 of 13.5µM and a SI of 1.65. In human A549-ACE2 cells, CPZ was also associated with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, with an IC50 of 11.3 µM, a CC50 of 23.1 µM and a SI of 2.04. DISCUSSION: Even though the measured SI are low, such IC50 measured in vitro may translate to CPZ dosage used in clinical routine because of CPZ high biodistribution in lungs and in saliva. Also, CPZ brain distribution could be of high interest for treating or preventing the neurological and psychiatric forms of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: These preclinical findings support clinical investigation of the repurposing of CPZ, a largely used drug with mild side effects, in COVID-19 treatment.","Plaze, Marion; Attali, David; Prot, Matthieu; Petit, Anne-Cécile; Blatzer, Michael; Vinckier, Fabien; Levillayer, Laurine; Chiaravalli, Jeanne; Perin-Dureau, Florent; Cachia, Arnaud; Friedlander, Gérard; Chrétien, Fabrice; Simon-Loriere, Etienne; Gaillard, Raphaël",Int J Antimicrob Agents,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33387629/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106274; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857920305021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920305021?v=s5,636
667879,The role of an Orthopaedic Surgeon in the time of Covid-19 Pandemic–a German perspective,2020-05-13,"Background: Calprotectin is present in the cytosol of neutrophil granulocytes and released upon activation. Fecal calprotectin is applied in the clinical management of inflammatory bowel disease whereas serum calprotectin has been discussed as a biomarker in inflammatory disorders. However, its long-term prognostic relevance in critical illness remains unclear. Our aim was to investigate serum calprotectin concentrations as a prognostic biomarker in critically ill and septic patients. Methods: Serum calprotectin concentrations were analyzed in 165 critically ill patients (108 with sepsis, 57 without sepsis) included in our observational study. Patients were enrolled upon admission to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of the RWTH Aachen University Hospital. Calprotectin concentrations were compared to 24 healthy controls and correlated with clinical parameters, therapeutic interventions, and survival. Results: Serum calprotectin concentrations were significantly increased in ICU patients as well as in septic patients compared to respective controls (p < 0.001 for ICU patients and p = 0.001 for septic patients). Lower calprotectin concentrations were measured in patients with comorbidities i.e., coronary artery disease. Calprotectin concentrations strongly correlated with the C-reactive protein (p < 0.001) and were closely associated to parameters of mechanical ventilation (i.a. inspiratory oxygen fraction, FiO(2); p < 0.001). The overall survival was significantly impaired in septic patients with high baseline calprotectin concentrations (p = 0.036). However, patients with increasing calprotectin serum concentrations within the first week of ICU admission showed an improved overall survival (p = 0.009). Conclusions: In summary, serum calprotectin concentrations are significantly increased in critically ill patients with sepsis. High calprotectin concentrations at ICU admission predict long-term mortality risk, whereas increasing calprotectin concentrations are associated with a favorable long-term outcome.","Wirtz, Theresa H.; Buendgens, Lukas; Weiskirchen, Ralf; Loosen, Sven H.; Haehnsen, Nina; Puengel, Tobias; Abu Jhaisha, Samira; Brozat, Jonathan F.; Hohlstein, Philipp; Koek, Ger; Eisert, Albrecht; Mohr, Raphael; Roderburg, Christoph; Luedde, Tom; Trautwein, Christian; Tacke, Frank; Koch, Alexander",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33238644/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10110990,636

We further analyzed subsets of critical procedures. RESULTS: We found a decline in critical procedures by 43% although no critical procedures were postponed by the hospital. Meanwhile, the share of critical procedures increased up to 90% caused by the cancellation of elective surgery. Especially worrisome was that diagnostic procedures for suspected malignancies decreased by 41% during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The decline in critical procedures in otorhinolaryngology as collateral damage of the COVID-19 pandemic is considerable and therefore alarming.

Before you proceed for an aerosol-generating procedure like RCT, and crown preparations, diagnosis, and screening of COVID-19 is very important, as failure may end up infecting yourself and would become a source of infection to your patient community. Due to limitations of data, medicines, and PPE shortage all around the world, screening of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 is very troublesome but necessary. To avoid any silent positive patient, the possible way is to ensure mandatory testing of every patient before you treat it. As the door to door surveillance of COVID-19 patients seems near to impossible in the Pandemic era for densely populated developing countries like India. The possible screening regimes include personal surveillance and contact tracing in the very first appointments. So, on the basis of the knowledge and sources we have so far, we have tried to classify the asymptomatic patients seen in the clinics and their possible screening management there. As it is said classification of a disease, is the first step toward a deep understanding of it. After screening, suspects can be sent to more resourceful places for their managements, and incidences of community spread of the disease through dental clinics can be avoided.","Jethi, Navdeep; Pandav, Gaurav; Nagri, Divya; Pandav, Sakshi; Kumari, Dibya; Kaur, Manpreet",J Family Med Prim Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33209762/; https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_796_20,636
668386,An Analysis of the Generalizability and Stability of the Halo Effect During the COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak,2021-03-24,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-associated Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions around the world. In pregnancy the dangers to the mother and fetus are still being explored. SARS-CoV2 can potentially compromise maternal and neonatal outcomes and this may be dependent on the pregnancy stage during which the infection occurs. OBJECTIVE: The present study was done to find the histopathological alterations in the placenta of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnancies with either no symptoms or mild coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 related symptoms and its association with neonatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective analytical study. Twenty seven asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women with a singleton pregnancy delivered between 1(st) July 2020 and 15(th) September 2020, were included as cases. An equal number of SARS-CoV-2 negative singleton pregnancies matched for maternal and gestational age during the same period were included as controls. After delivery the histopathological examination of the placenta of these women was done and the findings recorded on a predesigned proforma based on the Amsterdam consensus criteria for evidence of maternal and fetal vascular malperfusion changes. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were comparable between the cases and controls. The following features of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) were significantly higher in the placentae of COVID-19 positive pregnancies: retroplacental hematomas (RPH), accelerated villous maturation (AVM), distal villous hyperplasia (DVH), atherosis, fibrinoid necrosis, mural hypertrophy of membrane arterioles (MHMA), vessel ectasia and persistence of intramural endovascular trophoblast (PIEVT). Fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM) significantly associated with the positive pregnancies were chorioangiosis, thrombosis of the fetal chorionic plate (TFCP), intramural fibrin deposition (IMFD) and vascular ectasia. Additionally, perivillous fibrin deposition was also significantly higher in the placentae of cases. The percentage of spontaneously delivered women was comparable in the two groups. The sex and weight of the newborn and the number of live births were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women, with otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies, show evidence of placental injury at a microscopic level. Similar findings have been demonstrated in other studies too. This placental injury apparently does not lead to poor pregnancy outcomes. The extent of this injury in symptomatic cases of COVID-19 pregnancies and its consequences on the outcomes need to be analysed.","Jaiswal, Nishtha; Puri, Manju; Agarwal, Kiran; Singh, Smita; Yadav, Reena; Tiwary, Narendra; Tayal, Prerna; Vats, Barkha",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301211521000634; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2021.01.049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33556768/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301211521000634?v=s5,636

Consequently, broader testing than the current methods of nasal or throat swabs will significantly increase the number of people screening, leading to more effective control of the spread of COVID-19.

Herein the mutational status of 611 genomes from India along with their impact on proteins was ascertained. After excluding gaps and ambiguous sequences, a total of 493 variable sites (152 parsimony informative and 341 singleton) were observed. The most prevalent reference nucleotide was C (209) and substituted one was T (293). NSP3 had the highest incidence of 101 sites followed by S protein (74 sites), NSP12b (43 sites) and ORF3a (31 sites). The average number of mutations per sample for males and females was 2.56 and 2.88 respectively suggesting a higher contribution of mutations from females. Non-uniform geographical distribution of mutations implied by Odisha (30 samples, 109 mutations) and Tamil Nadu (31 samples, 40 mutations) suggests that sequences in some regions are mutating faster than others. There were 281 mutations (198 ‘Neutral’ and 83 ‘Disease’) affecting amino acid sequence. NSP13 has a maximum of 14 ‘Disease’ variants followed by S protein and ORF3a with 13 each. Further, constitution of ‘Disease’ mutations in genomes from asymptomatic people was mere 11% but those from deceased patients was over three folds higher at 38% indicating contribution of these mutations to the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2.","Laskar, Rezwanuzzaman; Ali, Safdar",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.19.345066,636
669516,Hasty Reduction of COVID-19 Lockdown Measures Leads to the Second Wave of Infection,2020-05-26,"BACKGROUND: The primary features of malignant glioma include high rates of mortality and recurrence, uncontrollable invasiveness, strong angiogenesis, and widespread hypoxia. The hypoxic microenvironment is an important factor affecting the malignant progression of glioma. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying glioma adaption in hypoxic microenvironments are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: The work presented in this paper focuses on the role of WNK3 gene in glioma invasion under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, we aim to explore its role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). METHODS: ShRNA targeting WNK3 transfection was used to knockdown the WNK3 expression in U87 cells. We used western blot analysis to detect the relative expression of proteins in U87 cells. The effect of WNK3 on cell migration was explored using a transwell assay in the U87 cell line. We also evaluated WNK3 expression levels in glioma samples by immunohistochemistry analysis. RESULTS: WNK3 expression was significantly higher in high-grade (III and IV) gliomas than in low-grade (I and II) gliomas. WNK3 expression was up-regulated in U87 cells when cultured in a hypoxic environment in addition; WNK3 knockdown inhibited the invasion of U87 glioma cells by regulating the EMT, especially under hypoxic conditions.

In order to further optimize culture conditions and determine stem cell growth in relation to microenvironments (including the stroma, medium and nanostructures of type I collagen films), both primary and pre-sorted stem cells were cultured on the type I collagen films with controllable degree of polymerization and film thickness, as confirmed by an atomic force microscope and surface profiler. We found that in a primary culture, the spreading of stromal cells is greatly restrained and both the size and number of colonies are significantly reduced on highly polymerized collagen films. In contrast, in a pre-sorted stem cell culture without stromal cells, the intrinsic stem cell properties and cell number are independent of the degree of collagen polymerization. Our results indicate that the nanostructures of type I collagen films primarily affect stem colony formation through the collagen–stroma interactions. In those cases, collagen film thickness shows no effect on colony formation.","Huang, Chun-Jen; Chien, Yi-Lun; Ling, Tai-Yen; Cho, Huan-Chien; Yu, John; Chang, Ying-Chih",Biomaterials,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961210008811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20673998/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.07.038; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0142961210008811,636

670157,Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Park Use in U.S. Cities,2021-04-25,"It is known that certain feline cell lines, such as the Crandell-Rees feline kidney cell, produce an RD-114-like virus. As a feline endogenous retrovirus, RD114 virus, exists in the genome of all cats, it can be assumed that contamination with the virus in feline and canine live vaccines manufactured by culturing cells of feline origin occurs. To detect an infectious RD114 virus in vitro, a LacZ marker rescue assay has recently been established. In feline and canine live vaccines approved in Japan, feline cell lines are widely used to produce vaccines, especially those containing canine parvovirus components. The LacZ marker rescue assay detects infectious viral particles, but the real-time reverse-transcription-PCR detects both infectious and defective viruses. The canine live vaccines manufactured in cells of feline origin showed positive results for the env gene by the real-time reverse-transcription-PCR, including all of the 8 vaccines produced in feline cell lines that were negative in the LacZ marker rescue assay. In conclusion, the present investigation suggests that the newly developed method has the advantages of shorter time requirements and can be applied as a valuable screening method to detect RD114 viral RNA in vaccines.","Narushima, Rie; Shimazaki, Tomoaki; Takahashi, Toshio",Biologicals,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1045105611000200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21345697/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1045105611000200; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2011.01.004,636

Its purported mode of action is as an immune modulator. Vitamin D, however, also affects the metabolism of phosphate and Mg, which may well play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 may induce a cytokine storm that drains ATP whose regeneration requires phosphate and Mg. These minerals, however, are often deficient in conditions that predispose people to severe COVID-19, including older age (especially males), diabetes, obesity, and usage of diuretics. Symptoms observed in severe COVID-19 also fit well with those seen in classical hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, such as thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, dysfunction of liver and kidneys, neurologic disturbances, immunodeficiency, failure of heart and lungs, delayed weaning from a respirator, cardiac arrhythmia, seizures, and, finally, multiorgan failure. Deficiencies of phosphate and Mg can be amplified by kidney problems commonly observed in patients with COVID-19 resulting in their wastage into urine. Available data show that phosphate and Mg are deficient in COVID-19, with phosphate showing a remarkable correlation with its severity. In one experiment, patients with COVID-19 were supplemented with a cocktail of vitamin D(3), Mg, and vitamin B(12), with very encouraging results. We, thus, argue that patients with COVID-19 should be monitored and treated for phosphate and Mg deficiencies, ideally already in the early phases of infection. Supplementation of phosphate and Mg combined with vitamin D could also be implemented as a preventative strategy in populations at risk.","van Kempen, Theo A. T.

671535,Monitoring of cases of anosmia may help control the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-02-08,"BACKGROUND: In a pandemic situation the overall mortality rate is of considerable interest; however, these data must always be seen in relation to the given healthcare system and the availability of local level of care. A recently published German data evaluation of more than 10,000 COVID-19 patients treated in 920 hospitals showed a high mortality rate of 22% in hospitalized patients and of more than 50% in patients requiring invasive ventilation. Because of the high infection rates in Bavaria, a large number of COVID-19 patients with considerable severity of disease were treated at the intensive care units of the LMU hospital. The LMU hospital is a university hospital and a specialized referral center for the treatment of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). OBJECTIVE: Data of LMU intensive care unit (ICU) patients were systematically evaluated and compared with the recently published German data. METHODS: Data of all COVID-19 patients with invasive and noninvasive ventilation and with completed admission at the ICU of the LMU hospital until 31 July 2020 were collected. Data were processed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: In total 70 critically ill patients were included in the data evaluation. The median SAPS II on admission to the ICU was 62 points. The median age was 66 years and 81% of the patients were male. More than 90% were diagnosed with ARDS and received invasive ventilation. Treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was necessary in 10% of the patients. The median duration of ventilation was 16 days, whereby 34.3% of patients required a tracheostomy. Of the patients 27.1% were transferred to the LMU hospital from external hospitals with reference to our ARDS/ECMO program. Patients from external hospitals had ARDS of higher severity than the total study population. In total, nine different substances were used for virus-specific treatment of COVID-19. The most frequently used substances were hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Immunomodulatory treatment, such as Cytosorb® (18.6%) and methylprednisolone (25.7%) were also frequently used. The overall in-hospital mortality rate of ICU patients requiring ventilation was 28.6%. The mortality rates of patients from external hospitals, patients with renal replacement therapy and patients with ECMO therapy were 47.4%, 56.7% and 85.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The mortality rate in the ventilated COVID-19 intensive care patients was considerably different from the general rate in Germany. The data showed that treatment in an ARDS referral center could result in a lower mortality rate. Low-dose administration of steroids may be another factor to improve patient outcome in a preselected patient population. In the authors’ opinion, critically ill COVID-19 patients should be treated in an ARDS center provided that sufficient resources are available.","Schroeder, Ines; Scharf, Christina; Zoller, Michael; Wassilowsky, Dietmar; Frank, Sandra; Stecher, Stephanie-Susanne; Stemmler, Joachim; Kneidinger, Nikolaus; Peterß, Sven; Zwißler, Bernhard; Irlbeck, Michael",Anaesthesist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33369696/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00101-020-00906-3,636

Korean medicine was incorporated into the Korean Classification of Diseases (KCD) 6 through the development of U codes (U20–U99). Studies of the burden of disease have used summary measures such as disability-adjusted life years. Although Korean medicine is included in the official health care system, studies of the burden of disease that include Korean medicine are lacking. Methods. A data-based approach was used with National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort data for the year 2012. U code diagnoses for patients covered by National Health Insurance were collected. Using the main disease and subdisease codes, the proportion of U codes was redistributed into the related KCD 6 codes and visualized. U code and KCD code relevance was appraised prior to the analysis by consultation with medical professionals and from the beta draft version of the International Classification of Diseases-11 traditional medicine chapter. Results. This approach enabled redistribution of U codes into KCD 6 codes. Musculoskeletal diseases had the greatest increase in the burden of disease through this approach. Conclusion. This study provides a possible method of incorporating Korean medicine into burden of disease analyses through a data-based approach. Further studies should analyze potential yearly differences.","Lee, Ye-Seul; Lee, Ye-Rin; Chae, Younbyoung; Park, So-Youn; Oh, In-Hwan; Jang, Bo-Hyoung",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27069494/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/8160838,636

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a prospective 12-month follow-up study of respiratory tract infections in 12 adult patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia. METHODS: Nasal swab samples and induced sputum samples were taken at the onset of acute respiratory tract infection and every 3 months thereafter. Samples were tested for bacteria and viruses. PCR tests were performed for 15 respiratory tract viruses. In case the results for rhinovirus were positive, follow-up nasal swab samples were taken every 2 weeks until rhinoviral PCR results became negative. Patients completed symptom diaries, which were collected every month. The spouses of the patients served as healthy control subjects. RESULTS: During the 12-month period, the 12 patients had 65 episodes of acute respiratory tract infections, and the 11 spouses had 12 acute episodes (P < .001). Respiratory tract viruses were found in sputum in 54% of the infections. Rhinovirus was the most common virus. In more than half of our patients, rhinoviral PCR results stayed positive for more than 2 months. The most long-acting persistence with the same rhinovirus was 4 months.

Vaccine hesitancy, characterized by lack of confidence in vaccination and/or complacency about vaccination that may lead to delay or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of services, threatens to undermine the success of COVID-19 vaccination programs. The rapid pace of vaccine development, misinformation in popular and social media, the polarized sociopolitical environment, and the inherent complexities of large-scale vaccination efforts may undermine vaccination confidence and increase complacency about COVID-19 vaccination. While the experience of recent lethal surges of COVID-19 infections have underscored the value of COVID-19 vaccines, ensuring population uptake of COVID-19 vaccination will require application of multi-level, evidence-based strategies to influence behavior change and address vaccine hesitancy. Recent survey research evaluating public attitudes in the U.S. toward the COVID-19 vaccine reveals substantial vaccine hesitancy. Building upon efforts at the policy and community level to ensure population access to COVID-19 vaccination, a strong healthcare system response is critical to address vaccine hesitancy. Drawing on the evidence base in social, behavioral, communication, and implementation science, we review, summarize and encourage use of interpersonal, individual-level, and organizational interventions within clinical organizations to address this critical gap and improve population adoption of COVID-19 vaccination.","Finney Rutten, Lila J.; Zhu, Xuan; Leppin, Aaron; Ridgeway, Jennifer L.; Swift, Melanie; Griffin, Joan M.; St Sauver, Jennifer L.; Virk, Abinash; Jacobson, Robert M.",Mayo Clin Proc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.12.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025619620314877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33673921/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619620314877?v=s5,636

We also examined whether methylphenidate has a protective effect regarding the risk of contracting RIDs among children with ADHD who have a history of methylphenidate treatment. Children in the Taiwan Maternal and Child Health Database from 2004 to 2016 were included in the present study. Upper and lower RIDs, influenza, ADHD, age, sex, and records of methylphenidate prescription were identified. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the significance of the risk of RIDs among children with ADHD in comparison with that among children without ADHD after adjustment for sex and age. The self-controlled case series analysis was conducted to examine the protective effect of methylphenidate treatment against RIDs. In total, 85,853 children with ADHD and 1,458,750 children without ADHD were included in the study. After controlling for sociodemographic variables, we observed that children with ADHD had significantly higher risks of upper RIDs, lower RIDs, and influenza infection than did those without ADHD. Among the children with ADHD who had a history of methylphenidate treatment, the risk of contracting RIDs was lower during the methylphenidate treatment period than during the nontreatment period.

This study started with two important questions: first, were there any similar atypical pneumonia outbreaks, even on a smaller level, reported between SARS in 2004 and COVID-19 in 2019/20 in China. Second, examining the beta-coronavirus most closely related to date with SARS-CoV-2 at the genome sequence level, strain RaTG13 (CoV4991), which was sampled from a horseshoe bat in Yunnan province, we asked where exactly did it come from. It was found that RaTG13/CoV4991 was collected from Tongguan mineshaft in Mojiang, Yunnan, China, in 2013. Surprisingly, the same mineshaft was also associated with a severe pneumonia-like illness in miners in 2012 killing three of the six miners. A Master's thesis (in the Chinese language) was found on the cnki.net website which described in detail the severe illness in miners. The thesis concluded that a SARS-like CoV originating from Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) was the predicted causative agent. The cases were remotely monitored by a prominent pulmonologist in China. Retrospective analysis of the pneumonia cases shows striking similarities with COVID-19. Bilateral pneumonia, vascular complications like pulmonary thromboembolism, and secondary infections are the main similarities. The treatment regimes were similar to the current treatments for COVID-19. We propose that the Mojiang mineshaft miners' illness could provide important clues to the origin of SARS-CoV-2. These cases should be studied by various academicians, researchers, and medical professionals as many important questions are raised in this context.","Rahalkar, Monali C.; Bahulikar, Rahul A.",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.581569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194988/,636

We assessed advance directive completion, healthcare proxy (HCP), and attitudes toward ACP among older adults ages 50+ living with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Internet-based surveys were administered to 100 participants residing in the Coachella Valley, California from April to June 2020. We examined self-reported completion of an advance directive, HCP, and attitudes toward ACP before and after COVID-19. Adjusted regressions were performed on attitudes toward ACP. Results: Participants' mean age was 64.2 years, most were non-Hispanic white (88.0%), men (96.0%), and identified as sexual minorities (96.0%). Many reported having an advance directive (59.6%) or HCP (67.3%). Most (57.6%) believed ACP to be more important now compared to the pre-pandemic era. Having an advance directive was associated with increase in age, higher education, living with other people, never having an AIDS diagnosis, and current undetectable viral load (p < 0.05). Having a HCP was associated with higher education, being married/partnered, and living with other people (p < 0.05). In a logistic regression model adjusted for education and living situation, the belief that ACP was more important during COVID was associated with not having an advance directive (OR: 5.07, 95% CI: 1.78–14.40) and fear of COVID-19 infection (OR: 4.17, 95% CI: 1.61–10.76.)

674877,A call to action: Community pharmacists to address COVID-19–related behavioral health concerns,2020-12-07,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to review the literature and compile key clinically relevant applications of telemedicine for use in otolaryngology relevant to the post-COVID-19 era. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic Literature Review. DATA SOURCES: Pubmed and Google Scholar. REVIEW METHODS: Pubmed and Google Scholar were queried using combined key words such as “telemedicine,” “covid” and “otolaryngology.” The searches were completed in March–August 2020. Additional queries were made with particular subspecialty phrases such as “rhinology” or “otology” to maximize yield of relevant titles. Relevant articles were selected for abstract review. Applicable abstracts were then selected for review of the full text. RESULTS: Initial search identified 279 results. These were screened for relevance and 100 abstracts were selected for review. Abstracts were excluded if they were not in English, not related to otolaryngology, or if the full text was unavailable for access. Of these, 37 articles were selected for complete review of the full text. CONCLUSION: The sudden healthcare closures during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a sharp increase in the use of telemedicine, particularly in subspecialty fields. Otolaryngologists are at a unique risk of infection resulting from the examination of the head and neck and aerosol-generating procedures due to the predilection of viral particles for the nasal cavities and pharynx. The COVID-19 pandemic may have served as a catalyst to implement telemedicine into clinical practice, however identifying ways to integrate telemedicine long term is key for a sustainable and viable practice in the post-COVID-19 era. Although many states are now finding themselves on the down-sloping side of their infection rate curve, many others remain at the apex. Additionally, the risk of future waves of this pandemic, or the onset of another pandemic, should not be overlooked. Practice modification guidelines that mitigate infection risk by utilizing telemedicine would be useful in these instances. Telemedicine can help to reduce infection spread by limiting unnecessary in-person interactions and help conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) by facilitating remote care with the added benefits of expanding care to broad geographic areas, limiting cost, time, and travel burden on patients and families, and enabling consistent follow up.","Samarrai, Ruwaa; Riccardi, Aaliyah C.; Tessema, Belachew; Setzen, Michael; Brown, Seth M.",Am J Otolaryngol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196070921000296; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196070921000296?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33545447/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2021.102928,636
674981,COVID-19-associated ARDS treated with DEXamethasone (CoDEX): study design and rationale for a randomized trial,2020,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic with high infectivity and pathogenicity, accounting for tens of thousands of deaths worldwide. Recent studies have found that the pathogen of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, shares the same cell receptor Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) with SARS-CoV. The pathological investigation of COVID-19 death showed that the lung had the characteristics of pulmonary fibrosis. However, how SARS-CoV-2 spreads from the lungs to other organs has not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell-type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy and fibrotic lungs, as well as in normal and failed adult human hearts, using published single-cell RNA-seq data. We found that ACE2 expression in fibrotic lungs mainly locates in arterial vascular cells, which might provide the route for bloodstream spreading of SARS-CoV-2. The failed human hearts have a higher percentage of ACE2-expressing cardiomyocytes, and SARS-CoV-2 might attack cardiomyocytes through the bloodstream in patients with heart failure. Moreover, ACE2 was highly expressed in cells infected by RSV or MERS-CoV and in mice treated by LPS. Our findings indicate that patients with pulmonary fibrosis, heart failure, and virus infection have a higher risk and are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 might attack other organs by getting into the bloodstream. This work provides new insights into SARS-CoV-2 blood entry and heart injury and might propose a therapeutic strategy to prevent patients from developing severe complications.","Guo, Jieyu; Wei, Xiangxiang; Li, Qinhan; Li, Liliang; Yang, Zhaohua; Shi, Yu; Qin, Yue; Zhang, Xinyue; Wang, Xinhong; Zhi, Xiuling; Meng, Dan",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.20047621,636

675451,Prevalence and Predictors of Prolonged Cognitive and Psychological Symptoms Following COVID-19 in the United States,2021-07-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak caused many negative effects on both the global and national economies. To implement effective policies to mitigate the negative impact of a pandemic, it is necessary to identify particularly vulnerable areas. The objective of this paper is to rank the EU countries in terms of the level of vulnerability of their economies to the impact of the pandemic. For this purpose, the COVID-19 Economic Vulnerability Index (CEVI) was constructed. It replaces the 15-dimensional set of characteristics of the countries with one aggregate, synthetic indicator estimated for 27 EU member states. In the study multivariate statistical methods, including agglomerative clustering and multi-attribute methods of object assessment were used to analyse the effects of the pandemic. The research shows that EU countries have different levels of economic vulnerability to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The southern European countries (Spain, Croatia, Greece and Italy), where the tourism sector plays an important role in GDP composition, are the most fragile. Germany and the Scandinavian countries proved to be the least sensitive to the negative impact of the pandemic. The CEVI can be an important part of the decision support system. It enables the identification of countries that show greater vulnerability to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and may help support countries that need help the most. The proposed index also indicates certain areas in the country’s economy that make it more vulnerable. The CEVI in combination with other instruments can be a very useful tool to improve the economy’s resilience and help it recover faster in the event of a pandemic shock.","Brzyska, Joanna; Szamrej-Baran, Izabela",Procedia Computer Science,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050921018676; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2021.09.128; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877050921018676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34630751/,636

The present study sought to analyze how the COVID-19 lockdown period affected interpersonal relationships between music teachers and students and sports coaches and athletes. As part of a semi-structured interview, eighteen participants—six athletes and their three coaches and six musicians and their three teachers—were asked to recall how their interpersonal relationships evolved during the lockdown. Findings showed that these changes could be grouped into four dimensions: establishing a new relationship; working on a new form for the relationship; developing functional, positive adaptations; and developingnon-adaptive,detached relationships. Findings also showed that members of the dyad gave meaning to their interpersonal relationship in a dynamic way, even over such a short time. There were some similarities between the experiences of musicians and athletes, highlighting the importance of a well-functioning dyad and good communication between the parties.","Antonini Philippe, Roberta; Schiavio, Andrea; Biasutti, Michele",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33072923/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05212; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844020320557; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844020320557,636

Since most of the news on social media is not verified by a central authority, it may contain fake news for various reasons such as advertising and propaganda. Considering an average of 500 million tweets were posted daily on Twitter alone in the year of 2020, it is possible to control each share only with smart systems. In this study, we use Natural Language Processing methods to detect fake news for Turkish-language posts on certain topics on Twitter. Furthermore, we examine the follow/follower relations of the users who shared fake-real news on the same subjects through social network analysis methods and visualization tools. Various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms have been tested with different parameters. The most successful F1 score of fake news detection was obtained with the support vector machines algorithm with 0.9. People who share fake/true news can help in the separation of subgroups in the social network created by people and their followers. The results show that fake news propagation networks may show different characteristics in their own subject based on the follow/follower network.","Taskin, Suleyman Gokhan; Kucuksille, Ecir Ugur; Topal, Kamil",Arab J Sci Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34611504/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13369-021-06223-0,636

The relative contribution of ambient air pollution exposure and adverse housing conditions to RTI admissions in young children is unclear and has not been assessed in a UK context. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The aim of the PICNIC study (Air Pollution, housing and respiratory tract Infections in Children: NatIonal birth Cohort Study) is to quantify the extent to which in-utero, infant and childhood exposures to ambient air pollution and adverse housing conditions are associated with risk of RTI admissions in children <5 years old. We will use national administrative data birth cohorts, including data from all children born in England in 2005–2014 and in Scotland in 1997–2020, created via linkage between civil registration, maternity and hospital admission data sets. We will further enhance these cohorts via linkage to census data on housing conditions and socioeconomic position and small area-level data on ambient air pollution and building characteristics. We will use time-to-event analyses to examine the association between air pollution, housing characteristics and the risk of RTI admissions in children, calculate population attributable fractions for ambient air pollution and housing characteristics, and use causal mediation analyses to explore the mechanisms through which housing and air pollution influence the risk of infant RTI admission. ETHICS, EXPECTED IMPACT AND DISSEMINATION: To date, we have obtained approval from six ethics and information governance committees in England and two in Scotland. Our results will inform parents, national and local governments, the National Health Service and voluntary sector organisations of the relative contribution of adverse housing conditions and air pollution to RTI admissions in young children. We will publish our results in open-access journals and present our results to the public via parent groups and social media and on the PICNIC website.

The pandemic and its fallout have laid bare deep-seated social and economic inequalities with marginalised groups being at greater risk of infection and being disproportionately affected by containment measures and their socioeconomic consequences. Stigma is a central element to such inequalities but remains largely overlooked in the debate on the response to COVID-19, including in LMICs. Yet we know from experiences with other infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and Ebola that disease-related stigma is detrimental to halting and controlling pandemics and achieving equitable development. Emerging evidence suggests that stigma associated with COVID-19 is already taking hold. This paper assesses potential driving factors of COVID-19-related stigma, and how this intersects with existing stigma fault lines and explores mechanisms through which COVID-19-related stigma may be counteracted, with a focus on LMICs.","Roelen, Keetie; Ackley, Caroline; Boyce, Paul; Farina, Nicolas; Ripoll, Santiago",Eur J Dev Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100598/; https://doi.org/10.1057/s41287-020-00316-6,636
676719,Telehealth and the Covid-19 Pandemic,2020-07-23,"The antemortem diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) remains challenging in clinical practice, since current testing methods have suboptimal diagnostic accuracy. Immunohistochemical testing of biopsy specimens and postmortem examination are the standard diagnostic methods, although direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing to detect feline coronavirus in macrophages in effusion specimens has been reported to have 100% specificity and has been recommended as an antemortem confirmatory test. The aim of this study was to compare the results of DIF testing in antemortem feline effusions with postmortem results using field samples. Effusion specimens were collected antemortem from 17 cats and tested by DIF, followed by postmortem examination. Histopathological examination of specimens collected at postmortem confirmed FIP in 10/17 cases and ruled out FIP out in 7/17 cases. Antemortem DIF testing was positive in all 10 cases confirmed as FIP at postmortem examination. In the seven cats where FIP was ruled out at postmortem examination, DIF was negative in five cases and positive in the remaining two cases. The calculated sensitivity of DIF testing was 100% and the specificity was 71.4%. Duplicate effusion specimens from eight cats that were initially DIF positive were stored refrigerated (4 °C) or at room temperature (22–25 °C) and subjected to serial DIF testing to determine the duration of positive results. DIF-positive specimens stored at both temperatures retained their positive status for at least 2 days.","Litster, A.L.; Pogranichniy, R.; Lin, T.-L.",Vet J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24076123/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023313003985; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.08.023; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023313003985,636

This approach has created safer vaccines but may limit vaccine efficacy due to poor immunogenicity. To combat global diseases such as COVID-19, malaria, and AIDS there is a clear urgency for more effective next-generation vaccines. One approach to improve the immunogenicity of vaccines is the use of nanoparticle platforms that present a repetitive array of antigen on its surface. This technology has been shown to improve antigen presenting cell uptake, lymph node trafficking, and B-cell activation through increased avidity and particle size. With a focus on design, we summarize natural platforms, methods of antigen attachment, and advancements in generating self-assembly that have led to new engineered platforms.

The basic strategy of this special drive involved identifying missed children and vaccinating them in temporary outreach sites for 1 week over consecutive 4-month period starting from October 2017. This study estimated the incremental economic and financial cost of conducting IMI in India from a government provider perspective. Five states—Assam, Bihar, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh were purposefully selected because of high concentration of IMI activities. The stratified random sample of 40 districts, 90 sub-districts and 289 sub-centres were included in this study. Cost data were retrospectively collected at all levels from administrative records, financial records and staff interviews involved in IMI. The weighted incremental economic cost per dose (including vaccine costs) was lowest in Uttar Pradesh (US$3.45) and highest in Maharashtra (U$12.23). Incremental economic cost per IMI dose was found to be higher than a recent routine immunization costing study by Chatterjee and colleagues in 2018, suggesting that it requires additional resources to immunize children through an intensified push in hard-to-reach areas. Incremental financial cost of the IMI programme estimated in this study will be helpful for the government for any future planning of such special initiative. The reasons for variation of unit costs of IMI across the study districts are not known, but lower baseline coverage, high population density, migration, geography and terrain and vaccinating small numbers of children per session could account for the range of findings. Further analysis is required to understand the determinants of cost variations of the IMI programme, which may aid in better planning and more efficient use of resources for future intensified efforts.","Chatterjee, Susmita; Das, Palash; Pinheiro, Anita; Haldar, Pradeep; Ray, Arindam; Brenzel, Logan; Resch, Stephen",Health Policy Plan,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czab053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33950262/,636

We aimed to quantify these variations between hospitals and over time during England’s first wave (March to July 2020) and assess available patient-level and hospital-level predictors to explain those variations. METHODS: We used administrative data for England, augmented by hospital-level information. Admissions were extracted with COVID-19 codes. In-hospital death was the primary outcome. Risk-adjusted mortality ratios (standardised mortality ratios) and interhospital variation were calculated using multilevel logistic regression. Early-wave (March to April) and late-wave (May to July) periods were compared. RESULTS: 74 781 admissions had a primary diagnosis of COVID-19, with 21 984 in-hospital deaths (29.4%); the 30-day total mortality rate was 28.8%. The crude in-hospital death rate fell in all ages and overall from 32.9% in March to 13.4% in July. Patient-level predictors included age, male gender, non-white ethnic group (early period only) and several comorbidities (obesity early period only). The only significant hospital-level predictor was daily COVID-19 admissions in the late period; we did not find a relation with staff absences for COVID-19, mechanical ventilation bed occupancies, total bed occupancies or bed occupancies for COVID-19 admissions in either period. Just 4 (3%) and 2 (2%) hospitals were high, and 5 (4%) and 0 hospitals were low funnel plot mortality outliers at 3 SD for early and late periods, respectively, after risk adjustment. We found no strong correlation between early and late hospital-level mortality (r=0.17, p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: There was modest variation in mortality following admission for COVID-19 between English hospitals after adjustment for risk and random variation, in marked contrast to early media reports. Early-period mortality did not predict late-period mortality.","Bottle, Alex; Faitna, Puji; Aylin, Paul P",BMJ Qual Saf,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2021-012990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34234008/,636

Here we show that this type of interference can be observed in individuals after immunization with recombinant E1E2 proteins. One hundred and twelve blinded serum samples from a Phase I, placebo-controlled, dose escalation trial using recombinant HCV E1E2 with MF59C.1 adjuvant in healthy HCV-negative adults were tested in ELISA for binding reactivity to peptides representing the E2 regions 412–426 (EP-I) and 434–446 (EP-II). All samples were subsequently tested for neutralizing activity using HCVcc 1a(H77)/2a chimera, HCVpp H77 and HCVpp HCV-1 after treatment to remove EP-II-specific antibodies or mock treatment with a control peptide. Among the 112 serum samples we found 22 double positive (EP-I and EP-II), 6 EP-II positive only, 14 EP-I positive only and 70 double negative. Depleting EP-II antibodies from double positive serum samples increased ID(50) neutralizing antibody titers (up to 4.9-fold) in up to 72% of samples (p≤0.0005) contrasting with ID(50) neutralization titer increases in 2 of 70 double negative samples (2.9%) (p>0.5). In addition, EP-I-specific antibody levels in serum samples showed a significant correlation with ID(50) neutralization titers when EP-II antibodies were removed (p<0.0003). CONCLUSION: These data show that antibodies to the region 434–446 are induced during immunization of individuals with recombinant E1E2 proteins and that these antibodies can mask effective neutralizing activity from EP-I-specific antibodies. Elicitation of EP-II-specific antibodies with interfering capacity should be avoided in producing an effective cross-neutralizing vaccine aimed at the HCV envelope proteins.","Kachko, Alla; Frey, Sharon E.; Sirota, Lev; Ray, Ranjit; Wells, Frances; Zubkova, Iryna; Zhang, Pei; Major, Marian E.",Hepatology,https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/hep.28108; https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.28108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26251214/,636

681074,Hepatic transcriptional effects of simvastatin and the possible impact on COVID-19,2021-08-31,"Introduction Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a health concern with an extensive burden on incidence and prognosis. While the increasing lifespan contributes to a higher incidence of CKD among the elderly, the diagnostic picture in this age group is complicated by senescence-related changes. A better understanding of the etiology and progression of the disease warrants renal biopsy in such patients. This study aims to explore the histopathological spectrum of native renal biopsies leading to CKD in elderly patients in a tertiary care hospital. Methods Among the list of patients who had undergone renal biopsy at our institute from January 2015 to March 2020, elderly patients aged ≥ 60years were chosen for this study. Their demographic details, lab investigations and histopathological reports were collected. The sex distribution and prevalence of different renal diseases was calculated. The subjects were classified into four broad diagnostic groups - primary glomerular disease, diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, and tubulointerstitial disease. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values were calculated and used to stage chronic kidney disease in these patients. Statistical analysis was carried out to find a correlation between diagnostic groups and CKD presence and between serum C3 values and immunofluorescence for the same on biopsy. Results One hundred thirty-two patients formed the study sample with a male to female ratio of 1.28:1, showing a slight male predominance. The most common diagnostic group was primary glomerular disease (46%), among which focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) was the most common entity (12%). 47.7% and 66.6% of patients in the study sample showed elevated serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine values, respectively. 86% of our study sample had low eGFR values, and the majority (35%) of the patients were classified under CKD stage 3. CKD incidence was high among patients with primary glomerular diseases, but no significant statistical correlation was found. 43.5% of all IF positive cases showed low serum C3 values and established a positive correlation between IF and serum C3 values. Conclusion There is no statistically significant correlation of the four diagnostic groups to the CKD. CKD in the elderly may be multifactorial, and a collaborative study across the nations may be needed to further evaluate the etiology.","S, Josephine; G, Barathi; M, Susruthan; Balasubramanian, Subalakshmi",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34381661/,636
681225,"They Saw It Coming: Rising Trends in Depression, Anxiety, and Suicidality in Creative Students and Potential Impact of the COVID-19 Crisis",2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND: A high proportion of COVID‐19 patients have cardiac involvement, even those without known cardiac disease. Downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2 and the renin‐angiotensin system, as well as inflammatory mechanisms have been suggested to play a role. ACE2 is abundant in the gut and associated with gut microbiota composition. We hypothesized that gut leakage of microbial products, and subsequent inflammasome activation could contribute to cardiac involvement in COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: Plasma levels of a gut leakage marker (LPS‐binding protein, LBP), a marker of enterocyte damage (intestinal fatty acid binding protein, IFABP), a gut homing marker (CCL25, ligand for chemokine receptor CCR9) and markers of inflammasome activation (IL‐1β, IL‐18 and their regulatory proteins) were measured at three time points (day 1, 3‐5 and 7‐10) in 39 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients and related to cardiac involvement. RESULTS: Compared to controls, COVID‐19 patients had elevated plasma levels of LBP and CCL25 but not IFABP, suggesting impaired gut barrier function and accentuated gut homing of T cells without excessive enterocyte damage. Levels of LBP were twice as high at baseline in patients with elevated cardiac markers compared with those without and remained elevated during hospitalization. Also, markers of inflammasome activation were moderately elevated in patients with cardiac involvement. LBP was associated with higher NT‐pro‐BNP levels, whereas IL‐18, IL‐18BP and IL‐1Ra were associated with higher troponin levels. CONCLUSION: Patients with cardiac involvement had elevated markers of gut leakage and inflammasome activation, suggestive of a potential gut‐heart axis in COVID‐19.","Hoel, H; Heggelund, L; Reikvam, DH; Stiksrud, B; Ueland, T; Michelsen, AE; Otterdal, K; Muller, KE; Lind, A; Muller, F; Dudman, S; Aukrust, P; Dyrhol‐Riise, AM; Holter, JC; Trøseid, M",J Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32976665/; https://doi.org/10.1111/joim.13178,636

Interestingly, numerous studies found that some pathogens, especially positive-single-strand RNA viruses, actually hijacked autophagy machinery to promote virus infection within host cells, facilitating different stages of viral life cycle, from replication, assembly to egress. Enterovirus, a genus of positive-strand RNA virus, can cause various human diseases and is one of main public health threat globally, yet no effective clinical intervention is available for enterovirus infection. Here we summarized recent literature on how enteroviruses regulate and utilize autophagy process to facilitate their propagation in the host cells. The studies on the interplay between enterovirus and autophagy not only shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying how enterovirus hijacks cellular components and pathway for its own benefits, but also provide therapeutic option against enterovirus infection.","Huang, Lihong; Yue, Jianbo",Semin Cell Dev Biol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2019.08.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1084952118302350; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084952118302350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563390/,636

Nonetheless, making cities more liveable and supportive of health and wellbeing remains a challenge. Decision-makers’ capacity to use urban health evidence to create more liveable cities is fundamental to achieving these goals. This paper describes an international partnership designed to build capacity in using liveability indicators aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and social determinants of health, in Bangkok, Thailand. The aim of this paper is to reflect on this partnership and outline factors critical to its success. Partners included the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, the UN Global Compact—Cities Programme, the Victorian Government Department of Health and Human Services, the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation, and urban scholars based at an Australian university. Numerous critical success factors were identified, including having a bilingual liaison and champion, establishment of two active working groups in the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, and incorporating a six-month hand-over period. Other successful outcomes included contextualising liveability for diverse contexts, providing opportunities for reciprocal learning and knowledge exchange, and informing a major Bangkok strategic urban planning initiative. Future partnerships should consider the strategies identified here to maximise the success and longevity of capacity-building partnerships.","Alderton, Amanda; Nitvimol, Kornsupha; Davern, Melanie; Higgs, Carl; Correia, Joana; Butterworth, Iain; Badland, Hannah",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34299769/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147322,636

We aimed to analyze cognitive decline during the pandemic year in people evaluated in a memory clinic in northern Italy, the epicenter of COVID-19 spread. (2) Methods: A single-center retrospective study was carried out, including individuals with annual follow-up evaluated in three different years (2020-GROUP, 2019-GROUP, 2018-GROUP). We performed an intergroup comparison of cognitive decline over a one-year follow-up, and an intragroup comparison in the 2020-GROUP to analyze the five-year cognitive decline trajectory, as measured by the MMSE. (3) Results: The 2020-GROUP showed a significant loss of MMSE points per year in the considered follow-up period compared with the 2019-GROUP and 2018-GROUP (p = 0.021). Demographics, clinical features, and the other analyzed variables, including rate of diagnosis, therapy, and comorbidities, did not significantly differ between groups. The five-year cognitive decline trajectory confirmed a significant worsening of cognitive decline between 2019 and 2020 (p < 0.001), while the decrease in MMSE scores was not statistically significant between previous time points.

Nature-based interventions (NBIs) that support people to engage with nature in a structured way are asset-based solutions to improve mental health for community based adults. However, it is unclear which NBIs are most effective, or what format and dose is most efficacious. We systematically reviewed the controlled and uncontrolled evidence for outdoor NBIs. The protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42020163103). Studies that included adults (aged ≥18 years) in community-based settings with or without mental and/or physical health problems were eligible for inclusion. Eligible interventions were structured outdoor activities in green and/or blue space for health and wellbeing. We searched ASSIA, CENTRAL, Embase, Greenfile, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science in October 2019; the search was updated in September 2020. We screened 14,321 records and included 50 studies. Sixteen studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs); 18 were controlled studies; and 16 were uncontrolled before and after studies. Risk of bias for RCTs was low to moderate; and moderate to high for controlled and uncontrolled studies. Random effects meta-analysis of RCTs showed that NBIs were effective for improving depressive mood −0.64 (95% CI: 1.05 to −0.23), reducing anxiety −0.94 (95% CI: 0.94 to −0.01), improving positive affect 0.95 (95% CI: 0.59 to 1.31), and reducing negative affect −0.52 (95% CI: 0.77 to −0.26). Results from controlled and uncontrolled studies largely reflected findings from RCTs. There was less evidence that NBIs improved physical health. The most effective interventions were offered for between 8 and 12 weeks, and the optimal dose ranged from 20 to 90 min. NBIs, specifically gardening, green exercise and nature-based therapy, are effective for improving mental health outcomes in adults, including those with pre-existing mental health problems.","Coventry, Peter A.; Brown, JenniferV.E.; Pervin, Jodi; Brabyn, Sally; Pateman, Rachel; Breedvelt, Josefien; Gilbody, Simon; Stancliffe, Rachel; McEachan, Rosemary; White, PiranC.L.",SSM Popul Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34646931/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100934,636

The traditional view of these elements is that of local RNA structures. This perspective, however, is changing due to increasing discoveries of functional viral RNA elements that are formed by long-range RNA–RNA interactions, often spanning thousands of nucleotides. The plus-strand RNA genomes of tombusviruses exemplify this concept by possessing different long-range RNA–RNA interactions that regulate both viral translation and transcription. Here we report that a third fundamental tombusvirus process, viral genome replication, requires a long-range RNA–based interaction spanning ∼3000 nts. In vivo and in vitro analyses suggest that the discontinuous RNA platform formed by the interaction facilitates efficient assembly of the viral RNA replicase. This finding has allowed us to build an integrated model for the role of global RNA structure in regulating the reproduction of a eukaryotic RNA virus, and the insights gained have extended our understanding of the multifunctional nature of viral RNA genomes.","Wu, Baodong; Pogany, Judit; Na, Hong; Nicholson, Beth L.; Nagy, Peter D.; White, K.

684447,When the game changes: Guidance to adjust sarcoidosis management during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-04-29,"Citizen science can facilitate in‐depth learning for pupils and students, contribute to scientific research, and permit civic participation. Here, we describe the development of the transnational school‐based citizen science project Phenology of the North Calotte. Its primary goal is to introduce pupils (age 12–15; grades 7–10) in northern Norway, Russia, and Finland to the local and global challenges of climate change resulting in life cycle changes at different trophic and ecosystem levels in their backyards. Partnerships between regional scientists and staff from NIBIO Svanhovd, State nature reserves, national parks, and teachers and pupils from regional schools aim to engage pupils in project‐based learning. The project uses standardized protocols, translated into the different languages of participating schools. The phenological observations are centered around documenting clearly defined life cycle phases (e.g., first appearance of species, flowering, ripening, leaf yellowing, snow fall, and melt). The observations are collected either on paper and are subsequently submitted manually to an open‐source online database or submitted directly via a newly developed mobile app. In the long term, the database is anticipated to contribute to research studying changes in phenology at different trophic levels. In principle, guided school‐based citizen science projects have the potential to contribute to increased environmental awareness and education and thereby to transformative learning at the societal level while contributing to scientific progress of understudied biomes, like the northern taiga and (sub)arctic tundra. However, differences in school systems and funding insecurity for some schools have been major prohibiting factors for long‐term retention of pupils/schools in the program. Project‐based and multidisciplinary learning, although pedagogically desired, has been partially difficult to implement in participating schools, pointing to the need of structural changes in national school curricula and funding schemes as well as continuous offers for training and networking for teachers.","Klütsch, Cornelya F.

Gender-, age-, and location-related differences during the COVID-19 pandemic",2020-07-14,"BACKGROUND: Cigarette craving, which can negatively impact smoking cessation, is reportedly stronger in women than in men when they initiate abstinence from smoking. Identifying approaches to counteract craving in people of different sexes may facilitate the development of personalized treatments for Tobacco Use Disorder, which disproportionately affects women. Because cigarette craving is associated with nicotine dependence and structure of the insula, this study addressed whether a person’s sex influences these associations. METHODS: The research participants (n = 99, 48 women) reported daily cigarette smoking and provided self-reports of nicotine dependence. After overnight abstinence from smoking, they underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging scanning to determine cortical thickness of the left and right anterior circular insular sulcus, and self-rated their cigarette craving before and after their first cigarette of the day. RESULTS: Women reported stronger craving than men irrespective of smoking condition (i.e., pre- and post-smoking) (P = .048), and smoking reduced craving irrespective of sex (P < .001). A 3-way interaction of sex, smoking condition, and right anterior circular insular sulcus thickness on craving (P = .033) reflected a negative association of cortical thickness with pre-smoking craving in women only (P = .012). No effects of cortical thickness in the left anterior circular insular sulcus were detected. Nicotine dependence was positively associated with craving (P < .001) across groups and sessions, with no sex differences in this association. CONCLUSIONS: A negative association of right anterior insula thickness with craving in women only suggests that this region may be a relevant therapeutic target for brain-based smoking cessation interventions in women.","Perez Diaz, Maylen; Pochon, Jean-Baptiste; Ghahremani, Dara G; Dean, Andy C; Faulkner, Paul; Petersen, Nicole; Tyndale, Rachel F; Donis, Andrea; Paez, Diana; Cahuantzi, Citlaly; Hellemann, Gerhard S; London, Edythe D",Int J Neuropsychopharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ijnp/pyab015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33830218/,636

The secondary objectives were to determine whether ampicillin affected respiratory score, gross consolidation, or the detection of P. multocida in lung tissue at postmortem exam (PME). Holstein bull calves (n = 39) were transported to the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine isolation facility at the mean (±SD) age of 52 ± 6 d. After a 7-d acclimation period, 30 calves were inoculated intratracheally with 10(10) cfu of ampicillin-sensitive P. multocida. Lung US and respiratory scoring were performed 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post-challenge, then US once daily and respiratory scoring twice daily until d 14. Calves were randomized to receive ampicillin [n = 17, treatment (TX), 6.6 mg/kg i.m. once daily for 3 d] or placebo [n = 11, control (CON), saline, equal volume, i.m. once daily for 3 d] when ≥1 cm(2) of lung consolidation was observed and ≥6 h had elapsed since challenge. Lung lesions ≥1 cm(2) were considered positive for consolidation. Calves were respiratory score positive if ≥2 in 2 or more categories based on the Wisconsin respiratory health score chart. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for US score and respiratory score as a proxy for time with consolidation and clinical respiratory disease, respectively. Gross lung lesions and pathogens were quantified following PME. At the time of first treatment, consolidation had developed in 28/30 calves (TX, n = 17; CON, n = 11) and 6% (1 out of 17) of TX and 9% (1 out of 11) of CON calves had a positive respiratory score. The TX calves had a significantly lower median (interquartile range given in parentheses) AUC for US score [TX: 23 (20, 29), CON: 47 (33, 53)], whereas mean AUC for respiratory score was not different between groups (TX: 93 ± 28, CON: 96 ± 17). On d 14, 70% (12 out of 17) of TX and 100% (11 out of 11) of CON calves had lung consolidation, and 24% (4 out of 17) of TX and 27% (3 out of 11) of CON calves had clinical respiratory disease. On PME, median consolidation was 10% (6, 15) for TX and 10% (2, 28) for CON calves. Lung cultures were positive for P. multocida in 77% (13 out of 17) of TX and 91% (10 out of 11) of CON calves. Lung health benefited from a 3-d ampicillin therapy, but benefits were short-lived. Treatment failures might be due to incomplete resolution of the initial lung infection. Future studies are needed to optimize TX strategies to improve long-term lung health.","Holschbach, C.L.; Raabis, S.M.; Ollivett, T.L.",J Dairy Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030219308355; https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-16992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548072/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030219308355,636

Although the main clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are associated with respiratory or intestinal symptoms, reports of neurological signs and symptoms are increasing. The etiology of these neurological manifestations remains obscure, and probably involves several direct pathways, not excluding the direct entry of the virus to the central nervous system (CNS) through the olfactory epithelium, circumventricular organs, or disrupted blood–brain barrier. Furthermore, neuroinflammation might occur in response to the strong systemic cytokine storm described for COVID-19, or due to dysregulation of the CNS rennin-angiotensin system. Descriptions of neurological manifestations in patients in the previous coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks have been numerous for the SARS-CoV and lesser for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Strong evidence from patients and experimental models suggests that some human variants of CoV have the ability to reach the CNS and that neurons, astrocytes, and/or microglia can be target cells for CoV. A growing body of evidence shows that astrocytes and microglia have a major role in neuroinflammation, responding to local CNS inflammation and/or to disbalanced peripheral inflammation. This is another potential mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 damage to the CNS. In this comprehensive review, we will summarize the known neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; explore the potential role for astrocytes and microglia in the infection and neuroinflammation; and compare them with the previously described human and animal CoV that showed neurotropism to propose possible underlying mechanisms.","Murta, Veronica; Villarreal, Alejandro; Ramos, Alberto J.",ASN Neuro,https://doi.org/10.1177/1759091420954960; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32878468/,636

On the 4th of March, the Italian government orders the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide. The aim of this study is to investigate the knowledge, practice and attitudes (KAP) of secondary school at the time of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. In this cross-sectional, web-based survey, conducted among the high school student population with age ranging from 14 to 19 years old, a questionnaire with 19 items regarding the KAP toward COVID-19 is asked. Study participants are recruited from several secondary schools of different areas. Frequencies and histograms are computed for descriptive purposes.

687123,The rebirth of health system in Italy after COVID-19 pandemia: starting points,2020-09-07,"BACKGROUND: Lockdown policies related to the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic has potential negative consequences for mental health in youths. METHODS: Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed in 3 572 adolescents, age 13 to 16 using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-10), in a representative longitudinal survey of Norwegian youths between February 2019 (T1) and June 2020 (T2). Predictors for symptom change were analysed with linear mixed-effects models. FINDINGS: Overall, clinical levels of anxiety and depression increased slightly from 5.5% at T1 to 6.3% at T2; Chi square 224.4 (df = 1), p<.001. However, the observed change was driven by the increase in age between assessments. Being a girl, having pre-existing mental health problems, and living in a single-parent household at T1, predicted higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms at T2 (p<.001). Living in a single-parent household was associated with a significant increase in symptoms, also when age was controlled for (p<.001). Living in a poor family however, or having a history of maltreatment, was associated with a significantly lower increase in symptoms (p<.001). INTERPRETATION: Anxiety and depressive symptoms increased slightly in Norwegian youths between 2019 and 2020, but this change seemed to be driven by increase in age rather than pandemic-related measures. Symptom levels were unevenly distributed across demographic groups both before and during the pandemic outbreak, indicating that health disparities persist for adolescents in risk groups during a pandemic . Health inequities related to living conditions need to be addressed in future action plans, and intensified measures to mitigate inequities are needed.

Evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe symptomatology might have cytokine storms, which increases mortality. The use of interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors may help in controlling the pathological immune response to the virus. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-6, stands as an optional treatment for COVID-19 patients presenting this inflammatory hyper-response. We conducted a retrospective, observational, cohort study including 50 patients affected by COVID-19 with severe pneumonia and poor prognosis criteria, who have also undergone standard treatment; 36 of these patients additionally received tocilizumab in an early stage. The need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality, recovery of respiratory function, and improvement of biochemical and hematological parameters were compared between cohorts. Most patients were men, non-smokers and the most frequently reported comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes. Recurrent symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnoea. 54.8% of patients from the tocilizumab group needed intubation, while in the control group 85.7% needed it. Treatment with tocilizumab significatively increased IL-6 levels, (554.45; CI 95% 186.69, 1032.93; P < .05) while C-reactive protein mean levels were reduced (–108.19; CI 95% –140.15, –75.33; P < .05), but no significant difference was found between cohorts. In comparison with the controls, tocilizumab reduced mortality (25.0% vs 42.9%, P = .021) and the number of ICU admissions (63.9% vs 100.0%, P = .021). 44.1% of patients treated with tocilizumab showed favorable radiological evolution, when compared with 15.4% of patients from the control group. Tocilizumab may improve clinical symptoms and mitigate deterioration observed in severe COVID-19 patients, and could be considered as an effective therapeutic option in subjects experiencing a significant inflammatory response to the disease.","Sánchez-Rovira, Pedro; Pérez-Chica, Gerardo; Ortega-Granados, Ana Laura; Aguilar-García, Josefa; Díaz-Beltrán, Leticia; Gálvez-Montosa, Fernando; García-Verdejo, Francisco; Luque-Caro, Natalia; Quero-Blanco, Cristina; Fernández-Navarro, Mónica; Rodríguez-Sánchez, Agustín; Ruiz-Bailén, Manuel; Yaguez-Mateos, Luis; Marín-Pozo, Juan Francisco; Sierra-Torres, María Isabel; Lacárcel-Bautista, Celia; Duro-Ruiz, Gaspar Jesús; Duro-Fernández, María Ángeles; García-Alegría, Javier; Herrero-Rodríguez, Carmen",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000026533; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34398008/,636

Drug repurposing is a feasible method for emergency treatment. As low–molecular-weight drugs have high potential to completely match interactions with essential SARS-CoV-2 targets, we propose a strategy to identify such drugs using the fragment-based approach. Herein, using ligand- and protein-observed fragment screening approaches, we identified niacin and hit 1 binding to the catalytic pocket of the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro), thereby modestly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of Mpro. Chemical shift perturbations induced by niacin and hit 1 indicate a partial overlap of their binding sites, i.e., the catalytic pocket of Mpro may accommodate derivatives with large molecular sizes. Therefore, we searched for drugs containing niacin or hit 1 pharmacophores and identified carmofur, bendamustine, triclabendazole, and emedastine; these drugs are highly capable of inhibiting protease activity. Our study demonstrates that the fragment-based approach is a feasible strategy for identifying low–molecular-weight drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 and other potential targets lacking specific drugs.","Gao, Jia; Zhang, Liang; Liu, Xiaodan; Li, Fudong; Ma, Rongsheng; Zhu, Zhongliang; Zhang, Jiahai; Wu, Jihui; Shi, Yunyu; Pan, Yueyin; Ge, Yushu; Ruan, Ke",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.079848,636

Initially, Pakistan lacked “standard operating procedures,” and the government had to ship testing kits from China and Japan. Moreover, due to violations of the lockdown and standard operating procedures (SOPs), the rapidly increasing number of cases created a burden on the healthcare system. More and more, this pandemic and its impact have grown. As vaccine development has not been successful yet, “herd immunity” can only be achieved if about three quarters of the population contract the virus—requiring immunocompromised citizens to be sacrificed for the sake of the country. Moreover, Pakistan has limited testing capacity, so most COVID-19 tests are missing their mark even as the virus spreads. The current scenario is also raising several concerns about the capacity of the government to tackle the prevailing healthcare crisis. In this regard, healthcare professionals suggest that the government must act responsibly to ensure better security provided to healthcare professionals. Identifying suspected cases, introducing personal protective equipment, and taking administrative measures to ensure that better security is provided to healthcare professionals are the needs of the hour to improve outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Testing, tracking, and lockdowns must be focused on areas where clusters are detected. The healthcare professionals must be given utmost protection before this pandemic could wreak havoc in terms of fatalities. Investing in the chronically underfunded healthcare system is needed, so that Pakistan can build capacity to fight the pandemic.","Khalid, Atiqa; Ali, Sana",Asian Bioeth Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837562/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41649-020-00139-x,636
