1708,1708,1708,Point-of-Use Mixing of Influenza H5N1 Vaccine and MF59 Adjuvant for Pandemic Vaccination Preparedness: Antibody Responses and Safety. A Phase 1 Clinical Trial,14.365002,12.358281,2014-11-18,"BACKGROUND: Avian influenza A/H5N1 has threatened human health for nearly 2 decades. Avian influenza A vaccine without adjuvant is poorly immunogenic. A flexible rapid tactic for mass vaccination will be needed if a pandemic occurs. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, blinded phase 1 clinical trial evaluated safety and antibody responses after point-of-use mixing of influenza A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) vaccine with MF59 adjuvant. Field-site pharmacies mixed 3.75, 7.5, or 15 mcg of antigen with or without MF59 adjuvant just prior to intramuscular administration on days 0 and 21 of healthy adults aged 18–49 years. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy subjects were enrolled. After vaccination, titers of hemagglutination inhibition antibody ≥1:40 were achieved in 80% of subjects receiving 3.75 mcg + MF59 vs only 14% receiving 15 mcg without adjuvant (P < .0001). Peak hemagglutination inhibition antibody geometric mean titers for vaccine + MF59 were ∼65 regardless of antigen dose, and neutralizing titers were 2- to 3-fold higher. Vaccine + MF59 produced cross-reactive antibody responses against 4 heterologous H5N1 viruses. Excellent safety and tolerability were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Point-of-use mixing of H5N1 antigen and MF59 adjuvant achieved target antibody titers in a high percentage of subjects and was safe. The feasibility of the point-of-use mixing should be studied further.","Mulligan, Mark J.; Bernstein, David I.; Frey, Sharon; Winokur, Patricia; Rouphael, Nadine; Dickey, Michelle; Edupuganti, Srilatha; Spearman, Paul; Anderson, Edwin; Graham, Irene; Noah, Diana L.; Mangal, Brian; Kim, Sonnie; Hill, Heather; Whitaker, Jenifer; Emery, William; Beck, Allison; Stephens, Kathy; Hartwell, Brooke; Ogilvie, Melinda; Rimann, Nayoka; Osinski, Eileen; Destefano, Ellen; Gajadhar, Theda; Strudwick, Amanda; Pierce, Karen; Lai, Lilin; Yue, Ling; Wang, Dongli; Ying, Carl; Cline, Amy; Foltz, Tara; Wagner, Nancy; Dull, Geraldine; Pacatte, Thomas; Taggart, Barbara; Johnson, Valerie; Haller, Logan; Looney, Candi; Li, Shixiong; May, Megan; Myers, Bridgette; May, Rachel; Parker, Lawanda; Cochran, Nertaissa; Bowen, Donna; Bell, Michelle; Scoggins, Jeffery; Burns, Angela; Stablein, Claire; Wolff, Mark; Jolles, Bernadette; Leung, Brenda; Lambert, Linda; Shorer, Shy; Buchanan, Wendy; Murray, Suzanne; Chang, Soju; Gorman, Richard",Open Forum Infect Dis,278,3
1832,1832,1832,Statin Treatment and Mortality: Propensity Score-Matched Analyses of 2007–2008 and 2009–2010 Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations,14.553178,12.424125,2015-03-04,"Background. Annual influenza epidemics are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. The use of immunomodulatory agents such as statins to target host inflammatory responses in influenza virus infection has been suggested as an adjunct treatment, especially during pandemics, when antiviral quantities are limited or vaccine production can be delayed. Methods. We used population-based, influenza hospitalization surveillance data, propensity score-matched analysis, and Cox regression to determine whether there was an association between mortality (within 30 days of a positive influenza test) and statin treatment among hospitalized cohorts from 2 influenza seasons (October 1, 2007 to April 30, 2008 and September 1, 2009 to April 31, 2010). Results. Hazard ratios for death within the 30-day follow-up period were 0.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], .25–.68) for a matched sample from the 2007–2008 season and 0.77 (95% CI, .43–1.36) for a matched sample from the 2009 pandemic. Conclusions. The analysis suggests a protective effect against death from influenza among patients hospitalized in 2007–2008 but not during the pandemic. Sensitivity analysis indicates the findings for 2007–2008 may be influenced by unmeasured confounders. This analysis does not support using statins as an adjunct treatment for preventing death among persons hospitalized for influenza.","Laidler, Matthew R.; Thomas, Ann; Baumbach, Joan; Kirley, Pam Daily; Meek, James; Aragon, Deborah; Morin, Craig; Ryan, Patricia A.; Schaffner, William; Zansky, Shelley M.; Chaves, Sandra S.",Open Forum Infect Dis,278,3
2786,2786,2786,Surveillance Study of Influenza Occurrence and Immunity in a Wisconsin Cohort During the 2009 Pandemic,14.370354,12.19714,2017-02-12,"BACKGROUND. Antibody and T-cell immunity to conserved influenza virus antigens can protect animals against infection with diverse influenza strains. Although immunity against conserved antigens occurs in humans, whether such responses provide cross-protection in humans and could be harnessed as the basis for universal influenza vaccines is controversial. The 2009 pandemic provided an opportunity to investigate whether pre-existing cross-reactive immunity affected susceptibility to infection. METHODS. In 2009, we banked sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from blood donors, then monitored them for pandemic influenza infection (pH1N1) by polymerase chain reaction or seroconversion. Antibodies to hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix 2 (M2), and HA-pseudotypes were measured in sera. T-cell inteferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot responses were measured in PBMC. RESULTS. There were 13 infections in 117 evaluable donors. Pre-existing T-cell reactivity to pH1N1 was substantial (of 153 donors tested, 146 had >100 spot-forming cells/10(6) cells). Antibodies reactive with pH1N1 were common: anti-NP (all donors) and anti-M2 (44% of donors). Pseudotype-neutralizing antibodies to H1 were detected, but not to highly conserved HA epitopes. Unexpectedly, donors with symptomatic pH1N1 infection had sharp rises in HA pseudotype-neutralizing antibodies, not only pH1N1 but also against multiple seasonal H1s. In addition, an exploratory study of a T-cell marker (response to NP(418-426)) identified probable infection missed by standard criteria. CONCLUSIONS. Although the number of infections was inadequate for conclusions about mechanisms of protection, this study documents the wide variety of pre-existing, cross-reactive, humoral and cellular immune responses to pandemic influenza virus antigens in humans. These responses can be compared with results of other studies and explored in universal influenza vaccine studies.","Lo, Chia-Yun; Strobl, Susan L.; Dunham, Kimberly; Wang, Wei; Stewart, Lucy; Misplon, Julia A.; Garcia, Mayra; Gao, Jin; Ozawa, Tatsuhiko; Price, Graeme E.; Navidad, Jose; Gradus, Steve; Bhattacharyya, Sanjib; Viboud, Cecile; Eichelberger, Maryna C.; Weiss, Carol D.; Gorski, Jack; Epstein, Suzanne L.",Open Forum Infect Dis,278,3

MF59® adjuvant reduces the antigen required per dose, allowing for dose sparing and more rapid vaccine availability. METHODS: Two multicenter, phase II trials were conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an MF59-adjuvanted, cell culture–derived, A/H5N1 vaccine (aH5N1c) among 979 adult (18–64 years old) and 1393 elderly (≥65 years old) subjects. Participants were equally randomized to receive 2 full-dose (7.5 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose) or 2 half-dose aH5N1c vaccinations 3 weeks apart. Outcomes were based on Center for Biologics Evaluation Research and Review (CBER) and Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) licensure criteria (titers ≥1:40 and seroconversions on day 43). Solicited reactions and adverse events were assessed (www.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01776541 and NCT01766921). RESULTS: CBER and CHMP criteria were met by both age groups. CBER criteria for hemagglutination titers were met for the full-dose formulation. Solicited reaction frequencies tended to be higher in the full-dose group and were of mild to moderate intensity. No vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In adult and elderly participants, the full-dose aH5N1c vaccine formulation was well tolerated and met US and European licensure criteria for pandemic vaccines.","Frey, Sharon E; Shakib, Sepehr; Chanthavanich, Pornthep; Richmond, Peter; Smith, Timothy; Tantawichien, Terapong; Kittel, Claudia; Jaehnig, Peter; Mojares, Zenaida; Verma, Bikash; Kanesa-thasan, Niranjan; Hohenboken, Matthew",Open Forum Infect Dis,278,3

This article approaches those issues through the analysis of urban-rural mortality differentials from 1890 to 1930. Until 1910, infectious diseases dwarfed degenerative diseases in leading causes of death, and generally, the more urban the location was, the higher infectious disease and overall death rates were—a direct relationship. But by 1930, degenerative diseases had eclipsed infectious diseases, and infectious disease mortality had ceased to differ between cities and rural areas. The 1918 influenza pandemic broke out toward the end of these changes, and the larger the city was, the lower influenza and overall death rates were in that year—an inverse relationship. Such gradations characterized a new mortality regime emerging in the late 1910s and foreshadowed urban-rural mortality differentials in 1930 among persons aged 45 years or older, the group whose high rates of degenerative disease death would symbolize that regime. Thus, intertwined changes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries—a shift in leading causes of death from infectious diseases to degenerative diseases and a concomitant shift from a direct relationship to an inverse relationship between urban environment and mortality—produced the current mortality regime of the United States.","Maeda, Hiroshi",Am J Epidemiol,278,3

In the present study, shrews and rodents were trapped from 2006 to 2010 in eight lowland regions of Taiwan (< 500 m in elevation) to collect associated Laelaps mites, from which Rickettsia—a group of emerging pathogens—were detected and identified by assaying the gltA and ompB genes. A total of 853 Laelaps mites of at least four species were collected from a sample of 1004 small mammals that included one shrew and 10 rodent species. Rattus losea was the most common species (44.9% of total hosts) and hosted the highest percentage of mites (76.6% of total mites). Laelaps nuttalli was the most abundant mite species (51.7% of total mites), followed by Laelaps echidninus (24.2%), Laelaps sedlaceki (23.1%), and Laelaps myonyssognathus (0.2%). Notably, Rickettsia species with the highest similarity to spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae were identified from seven of the 72 pools of Laelaps mites. The presence of SFG rickettsiae in hematophagous Laelaps mites, particularly including species that are closely associated with commensal rodents in frequent contact with humans, calls for further investigation on the competence of Laelaps mites in transmitting rickettsiae.","Kuo, Chi-Chien; Lee, Pei-Lung; Wang, Hsi-Chieh",Exp Appl Acarol,278,3

The standard methods for detecting portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient and free portal pressure) are available in only a few hospitals due to their technical difficulty and invasiveness; thus, non-invasive measuring methods are needed. This study aimed to establish and assess a novel model to calculate free portal pressure based on biofluid mechanics. RESULT: Comparison of each dog’s virtual and actual free portal pressure showed that a biofluid mechanics-based model could accurately predict free portal pressure (mean difference: -0.220, 95% CI: − 0.738 to 0.298; upper limit of agreement: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.34 to 3.14; lower limit of agreement: -2.68, 95% CI: − 3.58 to − 1.78; intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.96 to 0.99; concordance correlation coefficient: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.93 to 0.99) and had a high AUC (0.984, 95% CI: 0.834 to 1.000), sensitivity (92.3, 95% CI: 64.0 to 99.8), specificity (91.7, 95% CI: 61.5 to 99.8), positive likelihood ratio (11.1, 95% CI: 1.7 to 72.8), and low negative likelihood ratio (0.08, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.6) for detecting portal hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the biofluid mechanics-based model was able to accurately predict free portal pressure and detect portal hypertension in canines. With further research and validation, this model might be applicable for calculating human portal pressure, detecting portal hypertensive patients, and evaluating disease progression and treatment efficacy.","Lin, Jia-Yun; Zhang, Chi-Hao; Zheng, Lei; Song, Chen-Lu; Deng, Wen-Sheng; Zhu, Yi-Ming; Zheng, Li; Wu, Li-Zhong; Sun, Long-Ci; Luo, Meng",BMC Vet Res,278,1
15071,15071,15071,Travel-Related Antimicrobial Resistance: A Systematic Review,14.697348,11.96277,2021-01-16,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonosis. Leptospirosis incidence (LI) in Sri Lanka is high. Infected animals pass leptospires to the environment with their urine. Leprospires' survival in the environment to infect a new host depends on meteorological factors. El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) modulate the weather in Sri Lanka. OBJECTIVES: The determination of interrelationship between the LI in the Hambantota District, and local meteorological parameters, ENSO and IOD. METHODS: We acquired notified leptospirosis cases in the Hambantota District and population data. We calculated weekly leptospirosis incidences for 2008 to 2017.Weather data from two weather stations was obtained, averaged and converted into weekly data. We plotted time series graphs and observed the correlation between seven aggregated weather parameters and LI. We estimated cross-correlations between those weather parameters and LI. As our principal analysis we determined correlation between LI and seven local weather parameters, Nino 3.4, Nino4 and Dipole Mode Index (DMI) indices using wavelet analysis. RESULTS: Our wavelet analysis results showed troughs of minimum, maximum, mean temperatures, soil temperature, the evaporation rate, the duration of sunshine were followed by peaks in LI and peaks of rainfall followed by peaks of LI, all after lag periods. Our time series graphs and cross-correlation determination results are generally in agreement with these results. However there was no significant correlation between rainfall and LI in the cross-correlation analysis. There were peaks of LI following both peaks and troughs of DMI. There was no clear correlation between both Nino indices and LI. DISCUSSION: This may be the first long-term study demonstrating soil temperature, evaporation rate and IOD are correlating with LI. The correlation pattern of LI with temperature parameters differs from similar past studies and we explain the reasons. We propose ways to control high LI we observed after periods of weather favorable for transmission of leptospirosis.","Ehelepola, N. D. B.; Ariyaratne, Kusalika; Dissanayake, D. S.",PLoS One,278,3

The aim of this study was to present the treatment reality of aortic diseases based on the aortic interventions recorded in Switzerland’s vascular registry Swissvasc. METHODS: All interventions on the aorta that were carried out between January 2018 and December 2020 in Switzerland and entered in the Swissvasc registry were included in this overview. Interventions for the treatment of isolated pathologies of the iliac vessels as well as interventions on the ascending aorta and the proximal aortic arch were excluded. RESULTS: Open aortic surgery was performed in 28 hospitals and endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) in 33. Just under half of these hospitals achieved the recommended minimum number of cases for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) of 30 open and endovascular interventions per year, which are currently discussed in the literature. In line with the literature 67% of the elective treatments for AAA were performed by EVAR. Corresponding to the current literature, 11% of the AAA were ruptured in the 3‑year observation period. In contrast to the recommendations of the current guidelines almost 60% of the ruptured AAA were treated by open repair. There was a certain tendency for a spontaneous centralization in the treatment of thoracic aortic pathologies as 87% of the interventions were carried out in only 5 hospitals. CONCLUSION: This study shows that many clinics in Switzerland treat aortic pathologies, some with a very small caseload. Further investigations of the quality of care in the treatment of aortic pathologies are urgently needed.","Meuli, L.; Lattmann, T.",Gefasschirurgie,278,3

The present study has evaluated the level of risk of developing DM in Chandigarh and Panchkula based on the IDRS score. METHODS: As a part of a national diabetes control trial funded by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, 1,916 participants from the Chandigarh and Panchkula regions were assessed for the risk of developing DM. Risk assessment was done on the basis of the IDRS score which includes age, family history, waist circumference, and physical activity as its contributing factors. Participants with an IDRS score <30 were in the low-risk category, those with 30 to 50 were in the moderate-risk category, and those with >60 were in the high-risk category for DM. RESULTS: Out of the 1,916 screened respondents (59.86% females and 40.14% males), 894 participants (46.65%) were at a high risk for DM (IDRS >60), 764 (39.87%) were at a moderate risk (IDRS = 30–60), and 258 (13.46%) were at a low risk (IDRS <30). Waist circumference contributed to 35.90% of the high-risk category followed by age (19.67%) and physical activity (11.67%). Age and waist circumference also showed a strong correlation with the total IDRS score. CONCLUSION: The Chandigarh and Panchkula population showed a high tendency to develop DM based on the IDRS score. Modifiable risk factors such as waist circumference and physical activity were the major contributing factors. Apart from the modifiable risk factors, age was also another major contributing risk factor. Based on these outcomes, lifestyle modifications like yoga and exercise can be proposed for this population as a preventive approach to reduce the risk of developing DM and other associated cerebrovascular complications.","Sharma, Kanupriya; Battu, Priya; Anand, Akshay; Nagarathna, Raghuram; Kaur, Navneet; Malik, Neeru; Singh, Amit; Nagendra, Hongasandhra R",Ann Neurosci,278,3

Enriched granulocytes, containing neutrophils, isolated from study participants in three groups- ACLF(n = 10), chronic liver disease (CLD, n = 4) and healthy controls (HC, n = 4), were analysed by microarray. Differentially expressed genes were identified and validated by qRT-PCR in an independent cohort of ACLF, CLD and HC (n = 30, 15 and 15 respectively). The association of confirmed overexpressed genes with ACLF 28-day non-survivors was investigated. The protein expression of selected neutrophil genes was confirmed using flow cytometry and IHC. Differential gene expression analysis showed 1140 downregulated and 928 upregulated genes for ACLF versus CLD and 2086 downregulated and 1091 upregulated genes for ACLF versus HC. Significant upregulation of neutrophilic inflammatory signatures were found in ACLF compared to CLD and HC. Neutrophil enriched genes ELANE, MPO and CD177 were highly upregulated in ACLF and their expression was higher in ACLF 28-day non-survivors. Elevated expression of CD177 protein on neutrophil surface in ACLF was confirmed by flow cytometry. IHC analysis in archival post mortem liver biopsies showed the presence of CD177(+) neutrophils in the liver tissue of ACLF patients. Granulocyte genes ELANE, MPO and CD177 are highly overexpressed in ACLF neutrophils as compared to CLD or HC. Further, this three-gene signature is highly overexpressed in ACLF 28-day non-survivors.","Saha, Rohini; Pradhan, Sai Sanwid; Shalimar; Das, Prasenjit; Mishra, Priyanka; Singh, Rohan; Sivaramakrishnan, Venketesh; Acharya, Pragyan",Sci Rep,278,3

Here we review data we obtained on the immunological response elicited by two recombinant versions of the glycoprotein S from the swine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) expressed in transgenic plants. Arabidopsis or potato plants were genetically transformed with cDNAs constructs encoding the N-terminal domain (aa residues 1–750) or the full-length glycoprotein S of TGEV, responsible for the neutralizing antibody induction against the virus, under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV 35S) promoter. Genomic DNA and mRNA analysis of leave extracts from transformed plants demonstrated the incorporation of the foreign cDNA into the plant genomes as well as their transcription. Expression of recombinant polypeptides was observed in most transgenic plants by ELISA using specific antibodies. Mice immunized either parenterally with leave extracts from transgenic arabidopsis plants or, more interestingly, fed with potato tubers, developed antibodies that specifically reacted with TGEV in ELISA, immunoprecipitated the glycoprotein S and in some cases neutralized the virus infectivity. From the above results, we conclude that transgenic plants expressing glycoprotein S polypeptides may be potentially used as a source of recombinant antigen for vaccine production.","Escribano, J.M.; Borca, M.V.",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,278,9

The pathogenesis of AE is not fully understood. A combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors like microorganisms seems to contribute to the symptoms. The yeast Malassezia sympodialis is part of our normal skin micro flora but can act as an allergen and elicit specific IgE and T‐cell reactivity in patients with AE. Recently, we identified a novel major M. sympodialis allergen, designated Mala s 11 (22.4 kDa), with sequence similarity to the mitochondrial enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Interestingly, Mala s 11 has a high degree of homology to human MnSOD. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of recombinant Mala s 11 on antigen‐presenting dendritic cells. Monocyte‐derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) from healthy blood donors were cultured with or without Mala s 11 for different time periods. It was found that the maturation marker CD83 and the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 were upregulated on the MDDCs exposed to Mala s 11 for 24 h, as demonstrated by flow cytometry. Furthermore, coculture of MDDCs with Mala s 11 for 9 h induced an increased production of the inflammatory cytokines IL‐6 (200‐fold), TNF‐α (100‐fold) and IL‐8 (sixfold), as detected by the cytometric bead array (CBA) analysis. Our results suggest that Mala s 11 affects the immune response through DC maturation and production of inflammatory cytokines. The potential cross‐reactivity with human MnSOD needs to be explored and the exact role of Mala s 11 in the pathogenesis of AE assessed in clinical studies involving skin prick and atopy patch tests.","Vilhelmsson, M.; Ekman, G.

Recent studies introduce deep learning to mitigate the manual feature extraction (i.e., data representation) efforts and achieve high accuracy. However, there are still challenges in learning accurate representations for sensory data due to the weakness of representation modules and the subject variances. We propose a scheme called Distance-based HAR from Ensembled spatial-temporal Representations (DHARER) to address above challenges. The idea behind DHARER is straightforward—the same activities should have similar representations. We first learn representations of the input sensory segments and latent prototype representations of each class, using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based dual-stream representation module; then the learned representations are projected to activity types by measuring their similarity to the learned prototypes. We have conducted extensive experiments under a strict subject-independent setting on three large-scale datasets to evaluate the proposed scheme, and our experimental results demonstrate superior performance of DHARER to several state-of-the-art methods.","Bai, Lei; Yao, Lina; Wang, Xianzhi; Kanhere, Salil S.; Xiao, Yang",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,278,3

Increased Visits to Respiratory Protection Webpages during COVID-19,14.57571,12.136374,2020-12-31,"Measuring the spread of disease during a pandemic is critically important for accurately and promptly applying various lockdown strategies, so to prevent the collapse of the medical system. The latest pandemic of COVID-19 that hits the world death tolls and economy loss very hard, is more complex and contagious than its precedent diseases. The complexity comes mostly from the emergence of asymptomatic patients and relapse of the recovered patients which were not commonly seen during SARS outbreaks. These new characteristics pertaining to COVID-19 were only discovered lately, adding a level of uncertainty to the traditional SEIR models. The contribution of this paper is that for the COVID-19 epidemic, which is infectious in both the incubation period and the onset period, we use neural networks to learn from the actual data of the epidemic to obtain optimal parameters, thereby establishing a nonlinear, self-adaptive dynamic coefficient infectious disease prediction model. On the basis of prediction, we considered control measures and simulated the effects of different control measures and different strengths of the control measures. The epidemic control is predicted as a continuous change process, and the epidemic development and control are integrated to simulate and forecast. Decision-making departments make optimal choices. The improved model is applied to simulate the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States, and by comparing the prediction results with the traditional SEIR model, SEAIRD model and adaptive SEAIRD model, it is found that the adaptive SEAIRD model’s prediction results of the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic data are in good agreement with the actual epidemic curve. For example, from the prediction effect of these 3 different models on accumulative confirmed cases, in terms of goodness of fit, adaptive SEAIRD model (0.99997) ≈ SEAIRD model (0.98548) > Classical SEIR model (0.66837); in terms of error value: adaptive SEAIRD model (198.6563) < < SEAIRD model(4739.8577) < < Classical SEIR model (22,652.796); The objective of this contribution is mainly on extending the current spread prediction model. It incorporates extra compartments accounting for the new features of COVID-19, and fine-tunes the new model with neural network, in a bid of achieving a higher level of prediction accuracy. Based on the SEIR model of disease transmission, an adaptive model called SEAIRD with internal source and isolation intervention is proposed. It simulates the effects of the changing behaviour of the SARS-CoV-2 in U.S. Neural network is applied to achieve a better fit in SEAIRD. Unlike the SEIR model, the adaptive SEAIRD model embraces multi-group dynamics which lead to different evolutionary trends during the epidemic. Through the risk assessment indicators of the adaptive SEAIRD model, it is convenient to measure the severity of the epidemic situation for consideration of different preventive measures. Future scenarios are projected from the trends of various indicators by running the adaptive SEAIRD model.","Liu, Xian-Xian; Fong, Simon James; Dey, Nilanjan; Crespo, Rubén González; Herrera-Viedma, Enrique",Appl Intell,278,32

The first step is to extract audio from the videos, which is further transformed to textual data, and later on, it is utilized for the extraction of video content-based features. Secondly, the comments are analyzed, and features are extracted based on human responses/reactions over the posted content. Lastly, user profile based features are extracted. Finally, all these features are fed into the classifier.

However, its application by Skinner was inconsistent. As a result, distinct and sometimes contradictory interpretations regarding what it means for a culture to survive occasionally emerge in the behavior-analytic literature. In this article, we aim to identify the stimuli that prompted Skinner to emit the verbal response “cultural survival.” Our analysis suggests two problems: (a) the concept of cultural survival is used by Skinner to identify both the effects of cultural practices on the physical survival ofmembers of the culture and their effects on the survival of specific sets of social reinforcement contingencies via operant reinforcement, and (b) the concept is applied to two different phenomena—namely, first, the relation between the complete range of social reinforcement contingencies maintained by the human species and the physical survival of humankind, and, second, the relation between specific sets of these contingencies and the physical survival of particular groups. Finally, we argue for the importance of the precise identification of the groups and social contingencies that compose any “culture” submitted to a behavioral analysis.

However, these clinical decision tools have had suboptimal uptake in the everyday clinical practice in emergency departments (EDs), despite numerous implementation efforts. We aimed to test the feasibility of a multi-faceted intervention to implement an evidence-based PE diagnosis protocol. METHODS: We conducted an interrupted time series study in three EDs in Ontario, Canada. We enrolled consecutive adult patients accessing the ED with suspected PE from January 1, 2018, to February 28, 2020. Components of the intervention were as follows: clinical leadership endorsement, a new pathway for PE testing, physician education, personalized confidential physician feedback, and collection of patient outcome information. The intervention was implemented in November 2019. We identified six criteria for defining the feasibility outcome: successful implementation of the intervention in at least two of the three sites, capturing data on ≥ 80% of all CTPAs ordered in the EDs, timely access to electronic data, rapid manual data extraction with feedback preparation before the end of the month ≥ 80% of the time, and time required for manual data extraction and feedback preparation ≤ 2 days per week in total. RESULTS: The intervention was successfully implemented in two out of three sites. A total of 5094 and 899 patients were tested for PE in the period before and after the intervention, respectively. We captured data from 90% of CTPAs ordered in the EDs, and we accessed the required electronic data. The manual data extraction and individual emergency physician audit and feedback were consistently finalized before the end of each month. The time required for manual data extraction and feedback preparation was ≤ 2 days per week (14 h).

Treatments for TIC include tranexamic acid (TXA), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and coagulation factor concentrates (CFCs, e.g. prothrombin complex concentrates [PCCs] and fibrinogen concentrate [FCH]). Guidelines for TIC management vary across Europe and a clear definition of TIC is still lacking. METHODS: An advisory board involving European trauma experts was held on 02 February 2019, to discuss clinical experience in the management of trauma-related bleeding and recommendations from European guidelines, focusing on CFC use (mainly FCH). This review summarises the discussions, including TIC definitions, gaps in the guidelines that affect their implementation, and barriers to use of CFCs, with suggested solutions. RESULTS: A definition of TIC, which incorporates clinical (e.g. severe bleeding) and laboratory parameters (e.g. low fibrinogen) is suggested. TIC should be treated immediately with TXA and FCH/red blood cells; subsequently, if fibrinogen ≤ 1.5 g/L (or equivalent by viscoelastic testing), treatment with FCH, then PCC (if bleeding continues) is suggested. Fibrinogen concentrate, and not FFP, should be administered as first-line therapy for TIC. Several initiatives may improve TIC management, with improved medical education of major importance; generation of new and stronger data, simplified clinical practice guidance, and improved access to viscoelastic testing are also critical factors. CONCLUSIONS: Management of TIC is challenging. A standard definition of TIC, together with initiatives to facilitate effective CFC administration, may contribute to improved patient care and outcomes.","Černý, Vladimir; Maegele, Marc; Agostini, Vanessa; Fries, Dietmar; Leal-Noval, Santiago R.; Nardai, Gábor; Nardi, Giuseppe; Östlund, Anders; Schöchl, Herbert",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,278,3

HAdV-7-positive respiratory samples collected from children with ARI in Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Wenzhou and Guangzhou from 2014–2018 were selected for gene amplification and sequence analysis. Fifty-seven HAdV-7 clinical strains with hexon, penton base and fiber gene sequences were obtained. Meanwhile 17 strains were selected randomly from different cities for whole genome sequencing. Phylogenetic and variation analyses were performed based on the obtained sequences, HAdV-7 prototype strain Gomen (AY594255), vaccine strains (AY495969 and AY594256) and representative sequences of strains. The phylogenetic trees constructed based on whole genome sequences, major capsid protein genes (hexon, penton base and fiber) and the early genes (E1, E2, E3 and E4) were not completely consistent. The HAdV-7 strains obtained in this study always clustered with most of the circulating strains worldwide from the 1980s to the present. Compared with the HAdV-7 prototype strain Gomen (AY594255), some amino acid mutations in loop1 and loop2 of hexon and the RGD loop region of the penton base gene were observed. Recombination analysis showed that partial regions of 55 kDa protein and 100 kDa hexon-assembly associated protein genes among all HAdV-7 strains in this study were from HAdV-16 and HAdV-3, respectively.

At our quaternary care hospital in New York City, the rapid escalation of COVID-19 cases was accompanied by a massive surge in the need for hospital and critical care capacity. During this time, we noted a increase in infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE). METHODS: We retrospectively assessed microbiology data to identify patients with positive testing for SARS-CoV-2 who had clinical cultures with meropenem-resistant and/or carbapenemase gene-positive Enterobacterales. We obtained microbiological and clinical data by manual chart review. Available clinical isolates underwent long-range genomic sequencing using the MinION (Oxford) for rapid genotyping, resistance gene detection, and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: From March 1 to May 18, we identified 33 CPE isolates from 13 patients, including 29 Klebsiella pneumonia and four Enterobacter cloacae. Most patients (11/13) had a positive respiratory culture, and 7/13 developed bacteremia. All patients had prolonged, complex hospitalizations with extensive antibiotic exposure.

All four E. cloacae isolates belonged to ST270 and encoded NDM-1. Phylogenetic analysis of ST258 isolates including historical isolates from our hospital revealed a distinct lineage of isolates from COVID-19 patients (72% bootstrap support), with expected clustering of isolates from the same patient and patients that were cohorted together. CONCLUSION: While CPE have declined substantially in New York City in recent years, increased detection in patients with COVID-19 may signal a reemergence of these highly resistant pathogens in the wake of the global pandemic. System-level factors, such as the rapid scale-up of critical care capacity, while clearly needed to address the unprecedented reach of COVID-19, may have contributed to isolate clustering in these patients. Increased surveillance and antimicrobial stewardship efforts will be needed to mitigate the impact of CPE in the future.

Molecular SARS-CoV-2 Testing During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Experiences of a Hospital in Southeast Michigan, USA",14.412078,12.270586,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The majority of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) cases is comprised of non-critically ill adults. However, the medical epidemiology and clinical profile for mild COVID-19 is poorly described in the United States. METHODS: We prospectively recruited 151 mildly symptomatic adults from Emory Healthcare COVID-19 screening clinics in Atlanta, Georgia from March 18 to June 16, 2020. Interview-based questionnaires captured participants’ demographics, epidemiological history, and clinical features. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected to test for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Convalescent serum (13–74 days post symptom onset) from 19 participants was tested by an IgG ELISA. Descriptive and χ (2) analyses were performed to determine the characteristics of COVID-19 cases compared to patients who tested negative. RESULTS: A total of 151 patients were recruited. The majority were non-Hispanic white (51%), female (60%), middle-aged adults (46.3 y +/-15). Twenty-seven (17.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and most frequently reported fever (63%), cough (67%), fatigue (56%), and myalgias (56%). See Table 1. Fever was statistically more common in positive cases vs negative (63% vs 34%, p = 0.005). Cases also experienced loss of taste (22%) and loss of smell (19%) more frequently than non-cases (p=0.01 and p=0.03). Diarrhea (22% vs 23%) and shortness of breath (33% vs 36%) did not differ significantly between groups. None of the 14 PCR-negative participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and 3 out of 5 COVID-19 cases tested positive for SARs-CoV-2-specific IgG. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Mild COVID-19 cases reported fever, loss of smell and loss of taste significantly more than non-COVID-19 cases. Strong correlations between anosmia and ageusia with COVID-19 have been reported elsewhere, however these symptoms were only present in 19–22% of cases at the time of testing, limiting their utility for clinical diagnosis. Also, none of the PCR-negative participants tested positive for convalescent serology, supporting good sensitivity and negative predictive value of the RT-PCR test used in our clinic. Symptoms alone cannot differentiate COVID-19 from other illnesses, highlighting the critical need for widely available and highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tests.

Spontaneous pneumothorax in COVID-19,14.696561,12.392891,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been accompanied by the emergence of viral mutations, some of which may have distinct virological and clinical consequences. While whole genome sequencing efforts have worked to map this viral diversity at the population level, little is known about how SARS-CoV-2 may diversify within a host over time. This is particularly important for understanding the emergence of viral resistance to therapeutic interventions and immune pressure. The goal of this study was to assess the change in viral load and viral genome sequence within patients over time and determine if these changes correlate with clinical and/or demographic parameters. METHODS: Hospitalized patients admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test were enrolled in a longitudinal study for the serial collection of nasopharyngeal specimens. Swabs were administered to patients by hospital staff every 4 ± 1 days for up to 32 days or until the patients were discharged. RNA was extracted from each specimen and viral loads were calculated by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Specimens with qRT-PCR cycle threshold values less than or equal to 30 were subject to whole viral genome sequencing by reverse transcription, multiplex PCR, and deep sequencing. Variant populations sizes were estimated and subject to phylogenetic analysis relative to publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Sequence and viral load data were subsequently correlated to available demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: 60 patients were enrolled from March 26th to June 20th, 2020. We observed an overall decrease in nasopharyngeal viral load over time across all patients. However, the temporal dynamics of viral load differed on a patient-by-patient basis. Several mutations were also observed to have emerged within patients over time. Distribution of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in serially collected nasopharyngeal swabs in hospitalized adults as determined by qRT-PCR. Samples were collected every 4 ± 1 days (T#1–8) and viral load is displayed by log(copy number). [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in the nasopharynx decrease over time and that the virus can accumulate mutations during replication within individual patients. Future studies will examine if some of these mutations may provide fitness advantages in the presence of therapeutic and/or immune selective pressures. DISCLOSURES: Michael G.

Outpatient Antibiotic Stewardship in the COVID Era: Trends in antibiotic prescription in a statewide Veteran’s Affairs health care system,14.5147295,12.493847,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of COVID-19 in recent months has caused local and regional governments to enact protective measures that have hindered economies and imposed demanding restrictions on daily life. Households may be experiencing physical, psychological, social, and economic challenges due to these preventative measures. Populations with fewer resources and/or pre-existing conditions may be at higher risk for these negative, life-altering effects. Therefore, we investigated COVID-19 impact on daily life among persons living with HIV (PLH) in Chicago’s under-resourced, largely minority, west and southwest side communities. METHODS: We modified the EPII, a survey designed to measure pandemic disease impact over nine domains of life, to assess how COVID-19 affected PLH receiving outpatient HIV care. From 5/11–29/2020, participants (n=49) completed the survey online or over the phone and received a $10 grocery gift card. We present the proportion of respondents who reported that they or any household member was impacted by select survey items. RESULTS: More than half of respondents reported a household member getting laid off and/or furloughed (63%), increased mental health (45%) or sleep problems (51%), less physical activity (61%), and increased screen time (82%); 45% were unable to pay important bills. Positive changes included eating healthier foods (53%), more time for enjoyable activities (63%), more quality time with friends or family (65%), and paying more attention to personal health (76%). We observed differences by gender, age, and race/ethnicity over all domains (Table 1). Finally, 80% of those who participated in telehealth services were satisfied with their experience. Table 1. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Overall, respondents struggled with employment, emotional and physical health effects of COVID-19, yet also experienced aspects of positive life change. In the future, these results should be compared with results from a general population to determine whether PLH are disproportionately burdened. Regardless, COVID-19 has negatively impacted daily life for everyone, including PLH, and these individuals may need additional resources compared to their less resource-challenged counterparts.

Could Anticoagulant Use Prior to Infection with COVID-19 Decrease Mortality?,14.709013,12.2843075,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: African-Americans suffer a disproportionate impact from COVID-19, comprising about 24% of deaths while representing 13% of the US population. We conducted a study to understand COVID-19’s impact on African-Americans’ health attitudes. METHODS: In April 2020, we surveyed online a national sample of US adults on their health attitudes and behaviors before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Comparisons were analyzed using chi-squared tests. RESULTS: A total of 2,544 individuals completed the survey: 473 African-Americans, 282 Hispanics and 1,799 Caucasians responded. The mean ages of each group were 41.4 ± 11 years, 38.0 ± 11 years and 45.7 ± 13 years, respectively. Before COVID-19, African-Americans were least likely to report they had trust in science (53% vs. 68% for Hispanics and 77% for Caucasians; p< .01) and government (16% vs. 27% and 28%; p< .01). After COVID-19, the percentage of African-Americans who had trust in science and government fell further to 44% (p< .01) and 9% (p< .01), respectively, and remained significantly lower than the other two groups. Twice as many African-Americans vs. Caucasians stopped following science and health news after COVID-19 (9% vs. 4%, p< .01). The percentage of African-Americans who reported anxiety about their health rose from 30% pre-COVID to 53% after the outbreak (p< .01), and the percentage who reported anxiety about their family members’ health rose from 35% to 61% (p< .01). Only 25% of African-Americans surveyed agreed that if they contracted COVID-19, they were confident they would get the healthcare needed. CONCLUSION: After COVID-19, African-Americans’ trust in science and government fell and a meaningful percentage stopped following science and health news, possibly reducing access to important health information. The percentage of African-Americans reporting anxiety about the future, about their health and about their family members’ health all increased significantly after COVID-19. Only a minority of African-Americans agreed they would get the needed healthcare if they contracted COVID-19. These findings have implications for the mental health and behavioral impacts of COVID-19 on African-Americans and for the development of health communications to high-disease-incidence populations.

Children and COVID-19 in Colorado: The Children’s Hospital Colorado Experience,14.746859,12.115202,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: It is estimated that up to 10% of SARS-CoV-2 patients progress from early and pulmonary stages to the most severe stage of illness, which manifests as an extra-pulmonary systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome. Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) is an inflammatory marker that plays a role in the dysregulated host response of COVID-19 infected patients. Clinical monitoring of IP-10 has been restricted in the absence of a rapid diagnostic test. MeMed Key(TM) is a novel platform recently cleared to provide IP-10 measurements in 15 minutes. We hypothesized that providing physicians with real time IP-10 measurements would support detection and continuous monitoring of patients with a dysregulated immune response and potentially allow personalized immunomodulation to improve patient outcome. IP-10 levels reflect corticosteroid treatment [Image: see text] METHODS: From 7(th) April 2020 to 10(th) May 2020 blood was routinely collected serially from 52 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients hospitalized at a COVID-19 dedicated medical center. A clinical decision support protocol was in place focused on managing viral response, oxygenation and inflammatory state (NCT04389645). RESULTS: The median age of the 52 patients was 69, 69% were male, 21% were ventilated, 4 died, 2 due to non-COVID-19 related complications. The most common comorbidities were Diabetes 40% and Hypertension 46%. IP-10 >1000 pg/ml correlated with ICU admission (p< 0.05) and increased COVID-19 severity score (p< 0.01). 19 of the 52 patients had IP-10 >1000 pg/ml, of these 12 were treated with corticosteroids. Monitoring IP-10 within the clinical decision support protocol assisted with personalized corticosteroid regimens with the aim of reducing IP-10 < 1000 pg/ml. The 10 patients that survived exhibited IP-10 levels >1000 pg/ml for 2.6 days on average. In contrast, the 2 patients that died of COVID-19 related complications displayed an average of 7.5 days with IP-10 >1000 pg/ml (p< 0.05). CONCLUSION: Providing physicians with real time measurements of IP-10 in COVID-19 patients proved a useful tool as part of the clinical decision support protocol. Timely identification, monitoring and personalized treatment of COVID-19 patients exhibiting a dysregulated immune response may aid in improving patient outcome. Further studies are warranted.

However, the epidemiology and outcomes of bloodstream infections (BSI) in COVID-19 patients (pts) remains undefined. We report the utilization of blood cultures, risk factors and mortality associated with BSI in a large cohort of COVID-19 pts. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of all COVID-19 pts that had BC performed during hospitalization at HFHS, a 5-hospital system in southeast Michigan. BSI was defined using NHSN criteria. Demographics, comorbidities, severity of illness, and outcome of pts with and without BSI were compared. RESULTS: From 3/10/2020 to 4/28/2020, 2541 pts were hospitalized with lab-confirmed COVID-19. 1393 (55%) of these pts had BC performed and 80 (5.74%) met criteria for BSI. Of the 84 pathogens identified, Staphylococcus aureus was most common (Figure 1). As compared to 1313 COVID-19 pts without BSI, those with BSI were older (70.1 vs 64.5 years, P = 0.0024). Other factors significantly associated with BSI included chronic kidney disease, higher mSOFA score, ICU stay and mechanical ventilation (all P < 0.0001) (Table 1). Multivariate analysis revealed age (OR, 1.07 CI [1.06–1.08]), ICU stay (OR, 7.91 [CI: 5.75–10.87]) and mSOFA score (OR, 1.29 [CI: 1.13–1.47]) were independent risk factors associated with mortality. BSI was not associated with increased mortality (Table 3). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Although more than half of hospitalized COVID-19 pts had BC done, the number of BSI were low suggesting overutilization of BC. BSI was associated with older age and disease severity. Mortality was not affected by BSI but was primarily driven by age and severity of illness.

Impact of Defunding Family Planning Health Centers on Gonorrhea and Chlamydia Cases in Iowa: A Spatiotemporal Analysis,14.729422,12.39388,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 testing data in children from different backgrounds such as race/ethnicity can guide the strategies for controlling the pandemic. In this study, we aimed to characterize the percent positivity of real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among children with different race/ethnicity in Mississippi, a state with historic racial health disparity. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study using a deidentified COVID-19 registry abstracted from the electronic health record at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, the only academic institution in the state encompassing the main university hospitals and ambulatory sites statewide. Children aged 18 years or younger who underwent RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 between 11 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 were included in the study. The primary outcome of interest was positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, and the primary exposure of interest was race/ethnicity. Multivariable analysis was performed by developing a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of 1838 children who underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, 162 tested positive, corresponding to percent positivity of 8.8%. Non-Hispanic white children had percent positivity of 2.4%, which was substantially lower than that of non-white children (9.7%, 28.6%, and 11.5% for non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other race/ethnicity children, respectively) (Table). Older children (particularly those aged 10–18 years) also had higher percent positivity (Table, Figure). The risks associated with non-white race/ethnicity remained substantial after adjusting for insurance status, which was used as a surrogate for socioeconomic status (Figure). Table [Image: see text] Figure [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: We found a striking difference in percent positivity by race/ethnicity among children, suggesting inadequate allocation of testing resources to this population. Higher percent positivity among school age children may also have particular public health implications, considering their school attendance. We argue that minority children should not be left behind in data analysis, research, targeted testing and transmission reduction measures.

Effective Contact Tracing Strategies for COVID-19: A Municipal Health Department’s Model,14.71579,12.120458,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends upper respiratory tract (URT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing as the initial diagnostic test for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Lower respiratory tract (LRT) testing for patients requiring mechanical ventilation is also recommended. The goal of this study was to evaluate concordance between paired URT and LRT specimens in children undergoing pre-admission/procedure screening or diagnostic testing. We hypothesized that < 10% of paired tests would have discordant results. METHODS: Single center cross-sectional study including children with artificial airways who had paired URT and LRT SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing between 4/1/2020 and 6/8/2020. URT specimens included nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and aspirates. LRT specimens included tracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavages. URT and LRT specimens were classified as paired if the two specimens were collected within 24 hours. Artificial airways included tracheostomies and endotracheal tubes. Tests were classified as diagnostic versus screening based on the indication selected in the order. RESULTS: 102 paired specimens were obtained during the study period. Fifty-nine were performed for screening and 43 were performed for diagnosis of suspected SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 94 specimens (92%) were concordant, including 89 negative from both sources and 5 positive from both sources. Eight specimens (8%) were discordant, all of which were positive from the URT and negative from the LRT (Figure 1). Among patients undergoing screening, 3 of 4 positive tests were discordant and among symptomatic patients, 5 of 9 positive tests were discordant. There were no instances of a positive LRT specimen with a negative URT specimen. Figure 1. Performance of upper and lower respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing in children with artificial airways [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Overall, most paired samples from the URT and LRT yielded concordant results with no pairs positive from the LRT and negative from the URT.

A Randomized Crossover Study to Evaluate Interventions to Reduce Contamination during Reuse of N95 Respirators,14.5660515,11.991374,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounts for the majority of lower respiratory tract illnesses in hospitalized infants. In the U.S., RSV hospitalizations are well characterized; yet, emergency department (ED) and outpatient (OP) visits are underrecognized. We evaluated the burden of RSV across three distinct healthcare settings during one respiratory season. METHODS: From 12/16/19-4/30/20, we conducted a prospective RSV surveillance study among Davidson County, TN infants under one year who presented to an inpatient (IP), ED, or one of four OP clinics with either fever or any upper respiratory (i.e., cough, earache, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat) and/or lower respiratory [i.e., wheezing, crackles, rales, diminished breath sounds, shortness of breath (SOB)] symptoms. Demographic and illness history were collected during parental/guardian interviews, followed by medical chart abstraction. Nasal swabs were collected and tested for RSV using Luminex® NxTAG RPP. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 3/16/20 enrollment at three of the four OP clinics ceased. RESULTS: A total of 627 infants were screened, of whom 473 (75%) were confirmed eligible, 364 (77%) enrolled, 361 (99%) were tested for RSV of which 101 (28%) were RSV+ (IP=37, ED=18, OP=46) (Figure 1). Compared to RSV-negative subjects, RSV+ subjects were younger (6.6 vs. 4.9 months, p< 0.001), 56% were male and 48% white. By setting, infants in the OP setting were older than those seen in the IP and ED [(p=0.002), Figure 2]. Compared to infants in the OP setting, hospitalized infants were more likely to present with SOB and rhonchi/rales, but less likely to have only upper respiratory symptoms (Figure 3) and be African American (p=0.046). Infants in the IP setting had a higher proportion of clinical RSV diagnostic testing (73%) compared to the ED (39%) and OP (28%) settings (p< 0.001). Figure 1. Davidson County Infants with RSV by MMWR Week and Healthcare Setting (n=101) [Image: see text] Figure 2. Cumulative Enrollment of Davidson County Infants with RSV by Age in Months and Healthcare Setting (n=101) [Image: see text] Figure 3. Proportion of Davidson County Infants with RSV Showing each Clinical Symptom, by Healthcare Setting [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Two-thirds of RSV+ infants sought care from either an OP or ED setting, with nearly all hospitalized infants presenting with both upper and lower respiratory symptoms. The underutilization of diagnostic testing in the OP settings may underestimate the true burden of RSV. Future studies are essential to document the true prevalence of RSV in order to assess the need and impact of new interventions (e.g., immunizations, antivirals). DISCLOSURES: Danielle A.

The occurrence of stroke in COVID-19,14.593313,12.392927,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to many proposed treatments for COVID-19 induced cytokine release syndrome (CRS). We aimed to investigate the treatment response of Tocilizumab (TZB), an Interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor in this single center study. METHODS: A retrospective chart review in COVID-19 patients was conducted from 03/18/20 - 05/20/20. Patients with PCR confirmed COVID-19 who received TZB were included. Variables included dose and timing of TZB, trend of acute phase reactants, time to improved oxygenation and defervescence, 30-day mortality, and hospital/intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS). Descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: Twelve patients received TZB at least once during the study period. Median patient age was 51.5 years (interquartile range (IQR), 34–87), and mean body weight of 109 kg (SD = 33.8). At time of admission, mean day of illness was 6.6 days (SD = 3.3) into their illness. All patients received a standardized TZB dose of 400 mg, and 2 patients received a second dose. Nine out of 11 patients (75%) had elevated median IL-6 baseline levels of 38.3 (IQR < 5- 96.22). The average CRS score was elevated at 3.3 at the time of TZB administration. All patients who received TZB were on supplemental oxygen, and 58% were mechanically ventilated. A decrease in oxygen requirement in 24 hours was seen in mechanically ventilated patients (71%) compared to those not on mechanical ventilation (20%). Median ICU days were 17.5 (IQR, 3–39), and median LOS days were 21.5 (IQR 8–46). All patients had sustained decreases in CRP post-TZB administration. Almost half of patients (42%) were treated for bacterial pneumonia post TZB and 3 (25%) patients were treated for herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation. Majority (92%) of patients received additional COVID-19 therapies such as hydroxychloroquine, convalescent plasma, or remdesivir. During the study period only one patient expired. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that TZB may have a role in mechanically ventilated patients in decreasing oxygen requirement. However larger randomized studies are needed to understand which patients would benefit the most. Our study also highlights secondary infections and HSV reactivation in TZB patients.

Detroit’s Response to COVID-19 in Homeless Shelters,14.720828,12.298812,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The optimum duration of isolation precautions (IP) for SARS-COV-2-infected individuals is uncertain. Most healthcare facilities must rely on surrogates of infectivity such as illness duration or nucleic acid amplification (NA). The availability of NA remains limited in many locations, requiring laboratories to alternate platforms to provide uninterrupted support. Regulatory-driven repeat testing further stresses scarce resources. A target gene cycle threshold (Ct) of 24 has been shown to correlate with culture negativity. We sought to evaluate temporal, spatial, and demographic relationships of SARS-COV-2 Ct that could inform local infection control efforts and testing policy. METHODS: From 03-14-20 to 06-01-20, nasopharyngeal swabs from inpatients were prospectively tested weekly on an emergency-use authorized laboratory developed assay, or 1 of 3 commercial platforms targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, N, ORF1ab, S, and/or PanSARS-E genes. A regional COVID-19 registry was also queried. RESULTS: 70 inpatients were prospectively evaluated (Table). Mean time to negative was 28.5 days from symptom onset (SO) and 24.1 days from initial test. Initial Ct values were significantly lower compared to those on week 3 (Figure 1). 3.3%, 8.9%, 31.3% and 50.0% tested negative at weeks 1,2,3, and 4 respectively. Trajectories did not differ by race, gender or comorbidity. 13% had isolation precautions (IP) discontinued during admission (mean time to discontinuation 15.8 days; range 12–40). None were linked to new transmissions. 20% reverted to positive after being negative. 0% of a growing number of patients across our health system (27 at time of submission), who have had IP discontinued, were linked to new infections. Data from 180 consecutive patients were available for retrospective evaluation. Mean Ct did not differ between treated-and-released (23.0) and admitted patients (22.6), nor between ward (23.1) and intensive care unit patients (20.2) (all p > 0.4). Table [Image: see text] Figure 1 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Linear regression revealed that a Ct of 24 and negative Ct value will occur 8.8 and 36 days after SO (Figure 2). These findings are consistent with smaller cohorts, and they add to the growing body of evidence that test-driven approaches for maintenance of IP or patient disposition should be reconsidered.

Most of current studies focus on aerosols released from infected individuals, but the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater also should be examined. In this review, we used bibliometrics to statistically evaluate the importance of water-related issues in the context of COVID-19. The results show that the levels and transmission possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater are the main concerns, followed by potential secondary pollution by the intensive use of disinfectants, sludge disposal, and the personal safety of workers. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater requires more attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the most effective techniques, i.e., wastewater-based epidemiology and quantitative microbial risk assessment, for virus surveillance in wastewater are systematically analyzed. We further explicitly review and analyze the successful operation of a sewage treatment plant in Huoshenshan Hospital in China as an example and reference for other sewage treatment systems to properly ensure discharge safety and tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. This review offers deeper insight into the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 and similar viruses in the post-COVID-19 era from a wastewater perspective.","Meng, Xianghao; Wang, Xuye; Meng, Shujuan; Wang, Ying; Liu, Hongju; Liang, Dawei; Fan, Wenhong; Min, Hongping; Huang, Wenhai; Chen, Anming; Zhu, Haijun; Peng, Guanping; Liu, Jun; Qiu, Zhenhuan; Wang, Tao; Yang, Linyan; Wei, Yuan; Huo, Peishu; Zhang, Dayi; Liu, Yu",ACS ES T Water,278,32

To understand how economic conditions are associated with social cohesion, this study analyzes the correlations between individual and macroeconomic indicators and social cohesion attitudes as well as their cross-level interaction. The results from pooled OLS regressions with year fixed effects using French European Social Survey data (2008–2018) show that individual economic strain is associated with lower social trust and with higher egalitarian and anti-immigrant attitudes. Cross-level interaction results suggest that strained individuals can have stronger egalitarian and anti-immigrant propensities under a macroeconomic downturn. As a result, larger variations in public attitudes can occur, which could pose a risk to the value consensus and social order. The results of this study suggest potential negative consequences of micro- and macroeconomic hardship for various dimensions of social cohesion and suggest the need for a comprehensive policy strategy.","Cho, Seongha",Fr Polit,278,17

Previous analysis of pediatric orthopaedic surgery fellowship websites demonstrated they were often inaccessible and incomplete. As such, the purpose of this study was to (1) perform an updated assessment of the accessibility and content of pediatric orthopaedic fellowship program websites and (2) compare the results to the previous study to discern temporal trends in website accessibility and quality. Methods A list of pediatric orthopaedic fellowship programs was compiled from the San Francisco Match (SF Match) and the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA) online databases. All identified websites were evaluated for (1) accessibility and (2) the presence of 12 education and 12 recruitment criteria. These criteria were determined by prior fellowship website analyses and the needs of current fellowship applicants. Website accessibility and quality were compared with previously reported metrics. Results Approximately 91% of pediatric orthopaedic surgery fellowship programs had a functioning website. While the SF Match and POSNA databases listed nearly identical programs, there were discrepancies in the information provided by the two databases, and individual program website links provided on both databases were often nonfunctional. Fellowship program websites contained an average of 15.1 ± 3.9 total education and recruitment criteria (range: 3 - 21). The most common education criteria featured on program websites included information about research, affiliated hospital information, and rotations. The most common recruitment criteria featured on program websites included program descriptions, contact information, and social media links. There was an increased frequency in nearly all education and recruitment criteria evaluated when compared with 2014 metrics. Discussion Although website accessibility and content have improved since 2014, information on pediatric orthopaedic fellowship program websites remains incomplete, with many websites failing to provide information on criteria deemed important by fellowship applicants. In addition, many discrepancies exist between the SF Match and POSNA databases, the two primary sources of information for pediatric orthopaedic fellowship applicants. Increased consistency on pediatric orthopaedic fellowship websites and both the SF Match and POSNA databases may help applicants to better assess which programs to apply to and which programs to rank highly on their match list.","Cohen, Samuel A; Shea, Kevin; Imrie, Meghan",,278,24

Apart from other factors, potting media (PM) play a crucial role in determining the success of nursery cultivation. Worldwide, peat is the most commonly used substrate in PM because of its favorable physicochemical properties. However, due to ascending environmental and ecological concerns regarding the use of peat, a variety of new substrates have been used/tested by researchers/practitioners/growers as PM. Bark, coir pith, wood fiber, compost derived from various agro-residues, and vermicompost either alone or in combination are some of the commonly explored substrates and found to have the potential to replace peat to a greater extent. In lieu of availability, abundance, low cost, and no/low processing requirement, the use of agro-industrial residue (AIR) in the PM is the current trend. However, challenges associated with their adoption cannot be ignored. The present review is focused on providing collective information, scientific knowledge and detailed analysis of various AIR used in PM. The critical evidence-based review would help in developing a consistent approach for the identification, selection and characterization of a new renewable substrate. In addition, it would help in developing a rationale understanding of the practical and economic realities involved in the adoption of the same in PM.

Peptide vaccine formulations consist of multiple synthetic linear epitopes that together trigger desired immune responses that can result in robust immune memory. The advantages of linear compared to conformational epitopes are their simple structure, ease of synthesis, and ability to stimulate immune responses by means that do not require complex 3D conformation. Prediction of linear epitopes through use of computational tools is fast and cost-effective, but typically of low accuracy, necessitating extensive experimentation to verify results. On the other hand, identification of linear epitopes through experimental screening has been an inefficient process that requires thorough characterization of previously identified full-length protein antigens, or laborious techniques involving genetic manipulation of organisms. In this study, we apply a newly developed generalizable screening method that enables efficient identification of B-cell epitopes in the proteomes of pathogenic bacteria. As a test case, we used this method to identify epitopes in the proteome of Francisella tularensis (Ft), a Select Agent with a well-characterized immunoproteome. Our screen identified many peptides that map to known antigens, including verified and predicted outer membrane proteins and extracellular proteins, validating the utility of this approach. We then used the method to identify seroreactive peptides in the less characterized immunoproteome of Select Agent Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bp). This screen revealed known Bp antigens as well as proteins that have not been previously identified as antigens. Although B-cell epitope prediction tools Bepipred 2.0 and iBCE-EL classified many of our seroreactive peptides as epitopes, they did not score them significantly higher than the non-reactive tryptic peptides in our study, nor did they assign higher scores to seroreactive peptides from known Ft or Bp antigens, highlighting the need for experimental data instead of relying on computational epitope predictions alone. The present workflow is easily adaptable to detecting peptide targets relevant to the immune systems of other mammalian species, including humans (depending upon the availability of convalescent sera from patients), and could aid in accelerating the discovery of B-cell epitopes and development of vaccines to counter emerging biological threats.","D’haeseleer, Patrik; Collette, Nicole M.; Lao, Victoria; Segelke, Brent W.; Branda, Steven S.; Franco, Magdalena",Front Immunol,278,24

Holstein calves (n = 24) were randomly assigned to one of four routes of administration for 0.5 ml of saline: intramuscular (IM), intranasal (IN), subcutaneous (SC) and a null control. Calves were first trained to approach a milk reward of 1 L. Once the latency to approach the reward was consistent, calves received their assigned treatment when approaching the bottle. For the first 3 treatment sessions calves received a 1 L milk reward. This reward was then reduced to 500 mL, and then to 250 mL, and finally to 0 mL, each for 3 sessions. Compared to control calves, calves receiving the intramuscular injections showed a longer latency to approach the milk reward, but only when the milk reward was 0.25 L (P = 0.05) and 0 L (P < 0.01). Calves receiving the intranasal injections showed longer latencies relative to the controls only for the 0 L reward (P = 0.01). Calves receiving the subcutaneous injections did not differ from controls for any of the milk rewards (P > 0.2). We conclude that IM injections are aversive and that SC and IN routes are a refinement to be considered when feasible.","Ede, Thomas; von Keyserlingk, Marina A G; Weary, Daniel M",Scientific reports,278,31

Due to the COVID-19 crisis, that still keeps its impacts worldwide, numerous scheduled medical activities have been postponed and this interruption has a potential to modify the management of many cutaneous conditions including pemphigus. This narrative review aims to discuss the management of pemphigus in the era of COVID-19, considering the necessity to balance suitable pemphigus treatment with minimal risk of COVID-19-related mortality and morbidity. The data on the effect of treatments used for pemphigus on COVID-19 is limited. However, the evidence to manage patients properly is evolving and our knowledge is updated. Current expert recommendations include that patients with pemphigus should be informed clearly to avoid mismanagement and they should be monitored regularly for symptoms of COVID-19. Patients with mild disease can be managed with topical or intralesional corticosteroids, dapsone, or doxycycline. Systemic corticosteroids should be tapered to the lowest effective dose during the pandemic. Prednis(ol)one ≤10 mg/d can be continued in patients with COVID-19 while prednis(ol)one >10 mg/d may be reduced considering the activity of the disease. Conventional immunosuppressive therapies should only be discontinued in confirmed cases of COVID-19. Postponing rituximab treatment should be considered on a case by case basis. Intravenous immunoglobulin is not likely to increase the risk of infection and may be considered a safe option in patients with COVID-19. Given the psychological burden brought by COVID 19, online or face-to-face psychological support programs should be considered. This article is protected by copyright.

There is widespread consensus that thromboprophylaxis safely reduces morbidity and mortality. More than 25 evidence-based guidelines, published since 1986, also recommend routine thromboprophylaxis in the majority of hospitalized patients. As a result, thromboprophylaxis is recognized as a key safety priority for hospitals. Some of the remaining areas of controversy that will be discussed in this paper include the role of individual risk assessments to determine thrombosis risk and prophylaxis, replacement of low-dose heparin by low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), the optimal duration of prophylaxis, the role of combined thromboprophylaxis modalities, the safety of anticoagulant prophylaxis with regional analgesia, the use of LMWHs in chronic renal insufficiency, and the emerging role of new oral anticoagulants as thromboprophylactic agents. Despite the overwhelming evidence supporting thromboprophylaxis, rates of thromboprophylaxis use remain far from optimal. Successful implementation strategies to bridge this knowledge:care gap are the most important current challenges in this area. These strategies must be multifaceted, utilizing local, systems-based approaches as well as legislation and incentives that reinforce best practices.","Selby, Rita; Geerts, William",Hematology.

We estimate H1N1 1) hospitalization rates, 2) severity rates (length of stay, ventilation, pneumonia, and death) of those hospitalized, 3) mortality rates, and 4) time lags between infections and hospitalizations during the pandemic (June 2009 to March 2010) and post-pandemic influenza season (November 2010 to February 2011) in England. METHODS Estimates of H1N1 infections from a dynamic transmission model are combined with hospitalizations and severity using time series econometric analyses of administrative patient-level hospital data. RESULTS Hospitalization rates were 34% higher and severity rates of those hospitalized were 20% - 90% higher in the post-pandemic period than the pandemic. Adults (45-64-years-old) had the highest ventilation and pneumonia hospitalization rates. Hospitalizations did not lag infection during the pandemic for the young (< 24-years-old) but lagged by one or more weeks for all ages in the post-pandemic period. DISCUSSION The post-pandemic flu season exhibited heightened H1N1 severity, long after the pandemic was declared over. Policymakers should remain vigilant even after pandemics seem to have subsided. Analysis of administrative hospital data and epidemiological modelling estimates can provide valuable insights to inform responses to COVID-19 and future influenza and other disease pandemics.","Lau, Krystal; Dorigatti, Ilaria; Miraldo, Marisa; Hauck, Katharina",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,278,7

The effect of temperature on retention and selectivity was also evaluated, and overall thermodynamic parameters associated with the analyte adsorption onto the CSP surface were derived from van't Hoff plots. Interesting cases of enantiomer elution order (EEO) reversal, which are dependent on the nature of polar modifier, analyte structure, column-type, and temperature, were observed. The impact of substitution pattern and electronic properties of analytes and selectors on the separation behaviour was investigated by correlating chromatographic parameters and molecular properties determined by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Both coated and immobilized amylose tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) columns allowed for the baseline enantioseparation (2.0 ≤ RS ≤ 4.9) of all 4,4'-bipyridines considered in this study. These results appear particularly useful because both enantiomers of these 4,4'-bipyridine derivatives are currently under investigation as new inhibitors of transthyretin fibrillogenesis, a biochemical phenomenon which is implicated to cause amyloid diseases.","Peluso, Paola; Sechi, Barbara; Lai, Giancarlo; Dessì, Alessandro; Dallocchio, Roberto; Cossu, Sergio; Aubert, Emmanuel; Weiss, Robin; Pale, Patrick; Mamane, Victor; Chankvetadze, Bezhan",Journal of chromatography.

Transracial adoptive (TRA) parents are tasked with providing ethnic-racial socialization processes (ERS) to support TRA adoptees' ethnic-racial identity development and prepare them to cope with ethnic-racial discrimination. However, unlike nonadoptive families of color, TRA parents lack shared cultural history with adoptees and have limited experience navigating racial discrimination. Knowledge of ERS among TRA families has centered on unidirectional processes between parenting constructs, ERS processes, and children's functioning. However, ERS processes in this population have complexities and nuances that warrant more sensitive and robust conceptualization. This paper proposes a process-oriented dynamic ecological model of the system of ERS, situating transacting processes in and across multiple family levels (parent, adoptee, family) and incorporating developmental and contextual considerations. With its framing of the complexities in ERS among TRA families, the model offers three contributions: a conceptual organization of parenting constructs related to ERS, a more robust understanding of ERS processes that inform how parents provide ERS, and framing of transacting processes within and between parenting constructs, ERS processes, and children's functioning. Implications for research, policy, and practice are discussed.","Pinderhughes, Ellen E; Matthews, Jessica A K; Zhang, Xian; Scott, Judith C",Development and psychopathology,278,16

METHODS In vitro tracheal air sealing was studied in HVLP tracheal tube cuffs (internal diameter [ID] 8.0 mm) made from polyurethane ([PU] Seal Guard tracheal tube, Covidien, Athlone, Ireland) and from polyvinylchloride ([PVC] HiLo tracheal tube, Covidien) with and without Lanz pressure regulating valve. Tube cuffs were placed in a vertical 22 mm ID artificial trachea and inflated to 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 cm H2O cuff pressures. Pressure control ventilation with peak inspiratory pressures (PIPs) of 20 or 25 cm H2O was applied and air leakage was assessed spirometrically as the ratio of expiratory to inspiratory tidal volumes. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was applied to compare the air leakage with and without Lanz system for both cuff types at each cuff pressure and PIP (P < .05). RESULTS The PVC tube cuffs with Lanz system resulted in significant air leakage at both 20 and 25 cm H2O PIP as compared to those without the Lanz system, especially at cuff pressures lower than the preset PIP (P < .05). Although PU tube cuffs with Lanz system showed reduced air sealing when compared with cuffs without Lanz, the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION Cuff pressure compensation with the Lanz system during cyclic respiratory pressure changes interferes with the self-sealing mechanism in HVLP tube cuffs at cuff pressures lower than PIP level. This results in larger air leak across tube cuffs particularly in tube cuffs made from PVC.","Dave, Mital H; Spielmann, Nelly; Mauch, Jacqueline; Weiss, Markus",Journal of intensive care medicine,278,19

We aimed to study epidemiological and clinical characteristics of infants and children admitted for pertussis to a tertiary-care hospital and to investigate the risk factors for pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. MATERIALS AND METHODS With a retrospective study, we analyzed all medical reports of patients admitted to Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital in Rome from January 2011 to December 2018 with a diagnosis of pertussis. RESULTS We examined 195 patients. The majority of hospitalized children (66.15%) were <3 months of age. No mother had received pertussis containing vaccine during pregnancy. Ten cases required admission in PICU. The age at admission was lower in PICU patients with respect to ward patients (42.8 vs 240 days; p < .0007), length of hospital stay was longer in PICU group (24.7 vs 7.52 days; p < .003). Patients who needed PICU admission had greater white blood cell count at hospital admission compared with those hospitalized in the pediatric ward. One infant died and one had encephalitis. CONCLUSIONS Pertussis is a remerging disease. In infants, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

However, the events that lead to the recruitment of leukocytes are poorly understood. To study the cellular response in the acute phase of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-host cell interaction, we investigated the induction of chemokines, adhesion molecules, and DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin) by SARS-CoV. Immunohistochemistry revealed neutrophil, macrophage, and CD8 T-cell infiltration in the lung autopsy of a SARS patient who died during the acute phase of illness. Additionally, pneumocytes and macrophages in the patient's lung expressed P-selectin and DC-SIGN. In in vitro study, we showed that the A549 and THP-1 cell lines were susceptible to SARS-CoV. A549 cells produced CCL2/monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and CXCL8/interleukin-8 (IL-8) after interaction with SARS-CoV and expressed P-selectin and VCAM-1. Moreover, SARS-CoV induced THP-1 cells to express CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL8/IL-8, CCL3/MIP-1alpha, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL4/MIP-1beta, and CCL5/RANTES, which attracted neutrophils, monocytes, and activated T cells in a chemotaxis assay. We also demonstrated that DC-SIGN was inducible in THP-1 as well as A549 cells after SARS-CoV infection. Our in vitro experiments modeling infection in humans together with the study of a lung biopsy of a patient who died during the early phase of infection demonstrated that SARS-CoV, through a dynamic interaction with lung epithelial cells and monocytic cells, creates an environment conducive for immune cell migration and accumulation that eventually leads to lung injury.","Yen, Yu-Ting; Liao, Fang; Hsiao, Cheng-Hsiang; Kao, Chuan-Liang; Chen, Yee-Chun; Wu-Hsieh, Betty A",Journal of virology,278,1

Three primary stakeholder groups were surveyed: (a) CDNA members, (b) the National Surveillance Committee and (c) the readership of Communicable Diseases Intelligence, the primary means of data dissemination from NNDSS. The evaluation revealed that the system was acceptable, structurally simple, and that the data collected were actively used by stakeholders. However, the lack of clearly documented aims and objectives for NNDSS, inflexibility to changing needs, lack of timeliness and complexity in processes were seen as problematic. The results of this evaluation, supported by recent federal funding to enhance national biosecurity, will provide the framework for enhancing NNDSS to meet national communicable disease surveillance requirements in Australia.","Miller, Megge; Roche, Paul; Spencer, Jenean; Deeble, Mary",Communicable diseases intelligence quarterly report,278,8

During this reaction, the 5' end of minus-strand DNA becomes covalently linked to a protein. The position of the 5' end of minus-strand DNA was identified previously, but the initiation site for DNA synthesis on pregenomic RNA remained ambiguous because of a sequence repetition at the termini of the RNA template for reverse transcription. Employing a recently designed expression vector for the production of infectious WHV, we localized the origin of minus-strand DNA synthesis to the 3' end of pregenomic RNA. In addition, we identified the nucleotide sequences on pregenomic RNA that provide the signal for the initiation of reverse transcription. Removal of this signal sequence from pregenomic RNA abolished minus-strand DNA synthesis. Insertion of a DNA oligomer bearing this signal sequence at the 3' end of pregenomic RNA restored the production of minus-strand DNA joined to protein. Our results support a model in which protein is the primer for reverse transcription of minus-strand DNA of WHV.","Seeger, C; Maragos, J",Journal of virology,278,6

Older women who experience psychosocial loss are more likely to be dissatisfied with their life and feel more depressive and lonelier than their male counterparts. Among those who experience psychosocial loss, older people living in rural communities have a higher level of life satisfaction, while living in urban areas may counteract some of the positive impact of psychological growth on reducing the frequency of feeling depressed and lonely.

To date, however, the utility of such immunoassays remains unclear. In a mixed-design evaluation study, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of serological immunoassays that are based on various SARS-CoV-2 proteins and assessed the neutralizing activity of antibodies in patient sera. METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were prospectively followed alongside medical staff and biobank samples from winter 2018/2019. An in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay utilizing recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was developed and compared to three commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) targeting the nucleoprotein (N), the S1 domain of the spike protein (S1), and a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) based on full-length spike protein. Neutralization assays with live SARS-CoV-2 were performed. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred and seventy-seven individuals were included comprising 112 SARS-CoV-2 positives (defined as a positive real-time PCR result; prevalence 7.6%). IgG seroconversion occurred between day 0 and day 21. While the ELISAs showed sensitivities of 88.4% for RBD, 89.3% for S1, and 72.9% for N protein, the specificity was above 94% for all tests. Out of 54 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, 96.3% showed full neutralization of live SARS-CoV-2 at serum dilutions &#8805; 1:16, while none of the 6 SARS-CoV-2-negative sera revealed neutralizing activity. CONCLUSIONS: ELISAs targeting RBD and S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 are promising immunoassays which shall be further evaluated in studies verifying diagnostic accuracy and protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","Brigger, Daniel; Horn, Michael P; Pennington, Luke F; Powell, Abigail E; Siegrist, Denise; Weber, Benjamin; Engler, Olivier; Piezzi, Vanja; Damonti, Lauro; Iseli, Patricia; Hauser, Christoph; Froehlich, Tanja K; Villiger, Peter M; Bachmann, Martin F; Leib, Stephen L; Bittel, Pascal; Fiedler, Martin; Largiadèr, Carlo R; Marschall, Jonas; Stalder, Hanspeter; Kim, Peter S; Jardetzky, Theodore S; Eggel, Alexander; Nagler, Michael",Allergy,278,16

The growing number of internet-of-things (IoT) high-wattage appliances such as air conditioners, water heaters, and electric vehicles being connected to the power grid, together with the high dependence of ICT and control interfaces, make CPES vulnerable to high-impact, low-probability load-changing cyberattacks. Moreover, the side-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated a modification of electricity consumption patterns with utilities experiencing significant peak load and net-load reductions. The unusual sustained low load demand conditions could be leveraged by adversaries in order to cause frequency instabilities in the CPES by compromising hundreds of thousands of IoT-connected high-wattage loads. This paper presents a feasibility study of the impacts of load-changing attacks on CPES during the low net-load demand conditions caused by the lockdown measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically, during the state-at-home orders (SAHO) declared by different states in the United States. We analyze the load demand reductions caused by the lockdown measures using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), focusing on the March-to-July 2020 period and the New York region as the most impacted time period and location in terms of load reduction due to the SAHO being in full execution. Our feasibility study evaluates load-changing attack scenarios using real load consumption data from the New York Independent System Operator and shows that an attacker with sufficient knowledge and resources could be capable of producing frequency stability problems, with frequency excursions going up to 60.5 Hz and 63.4 Hz, when no mitigation measures are taken.","Ospina, Juan; Liu, XiaoRui; Konstantinou, Charalambos; Dvorkin, Yury",,278,16

This study aims to analyze the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain using maximum likelihood phylogenetic and Bayesian phylodynamic analyses. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was estimated in Wuhan, China, around November 24, 2019. Phylogenetic analyses of the first 12,511 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences obtained worldwide, including 290 from 11 different regions of Spain, revealed 62 independent introductions of the virus in the country. Most sequences from Spain were distributed in clades characterized by D614G substitution in S gene (20A, 20B and 20C) and L84S substitution in ORF8 (19B) with 163 and 118 sequences, respectively, with the remaining sequences branching in 19A. A total of 110 (38%) sequences from Spain grouped in four different monophyletic clusters of 20A clade (20A-Sp1 and 20A-Sp2) and 19B clade (19B-Sp1 and 19B-Sp2) along with sequences from 29 countries worldwide. The MRCA of 19A-Sp1, 20A-Sp1, 19A-Sp2 and 20A-Sp2 clusters were estimated in Spain around January 21 and 29, and February 6 and 17, 2020, respectively. The prevalence of 19B clade in Spain (40%) was by far higher than in any other European country during the first weeks of the epidemic, probably by a founder effect. However, this variant was replaced by G614-bearing viruses in April. In vitro assays showed an enhanced infectivity of pseudotyped virions displaying G614 substitution compared with D614, suggesting a fitness advantage of D614G.IMPORTANCE Multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions have been detected in Spain and at least four resulted in the emergence of locally transmitted clusters originated not later than mid-February, with further dissemination to many other countries around the world and a few weeks before the explosion of COVID-19 cases detected in Spain during the first week of March. The majority of the earliest variants detected in Spain branched in 19B clade (D614 viruses), which was the most prevalent clade during the first weeks of March, pointing to a founder effect. However, from mid-March to June, 2020, G614-bearing viruses (20A, 20B and 20C clades) overcame D614 variants in Spain, probably as a consequence of an evolutionary advantage of this substitution in the spike protein. A higher infectivity of G614-bearing viruses compared to D614 variants was detected, suggesting that this substitution in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could be behind the variant shift observed in Spain.","Díez-Fuertes, Francisco; Iglesias-Caballero, María; García Pérez, Javier; Monzón, Sara; Jiménez, Pilar; Varona, Sarai; Cuesta, Isabel; Zaballos, Ángel; Jiménez, Mercedes; Checa, Laura; Pozo, Francisco; Pérez-Olmeda, Mayte; Thomson, Michael M; Alcamí, José; Casas, Inmaculada",J. virol,278,16

Under these circumstances, the perception of the disease is going to have a relevant role in the individual's psychological adjustment. However, at the present time there is no validated instrument for evaluating adult perception of threat from COVID-19. Considering the importance of perception or representation of the disease in a state of social alert, our study intended to validate an instrument measuring the psychological process of the disease caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19). In view of the above, this study evaluated the factor structure and reliability of the version of the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ) for COVID-19 in a sample of adults. The sample consisted of 1014 Spanish adults (67.2% women and 32.8% men). The exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a unidimensional model of the scale, which was the one that showed the best fit and explained 43.87% of the variance. This brief version has adequate psychometric properties and may be used to evaluate the perception of threat from COVID-19 in an adult Spanish population.

A supportive end-of-life care approach emphasises family involvement, optimal symptom control, multidisciplinary team collaboration and death and bereavement support services for residents and families. Community-based and palliative care specialist physicians who visit residents in LTC facilities play an important role in supportive end-of-life care. Yet, perspectives, experiences and perceptions of these physicians remain unknown. The objective of this study was to explore barriers and facilitators to optimal supportive end-of-life palliative care in LTC through the experiences and perceptions of community-based and palliative specialist physicians who visit LTC facilities. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews, basic qualitative description and directed content analysis using the COM-B (capability, opportunity, motivation - behaviour) theoretical framework. SETTING: Residential long-term care. PARTICIPANTS: 23 physicians who visit LTC facilities from across Alberta, Canada, including both in urban and rural settings of whom 18 were community-based physicians and 5 were specialist palliative care physicians. RESULTS: Motivation barriers include families' lack of frailty knowledge, unrealistic expectations and emotional reactions to grief and uncertainty. Capability barriers include lack of symptom assessment tools, as well as palliative care knowledge, training and mentorship. Physical and social design barriers include lack of dedicated spaces for death and bereavement, inadequate staff, and mental health and spiritual services of insufficient scope for the population. CONCLUSION: Findings reveal that validating families' concerns, having appropriate symptom assessment tools, providing mentorship in palliative care and adapting the physical and social environment to support dying and grieving with dignity facilitates supportive, end-of-life care within LTC.","Harasym, Patricia; Brisbin, Sarah; Afzaal, Misha; Sinnarajah, Aynharan; Venturato, Lorraine; Quail, Patrick; Kaasalainen, Sharon; Straus, Sharon E; Sussman, Tamara; Virk, Navjot; Holroyd-Leduc, Jayna",BMJ Open,278,3

Moreover, the demand for dialysis resources has significantly increased since many COVID-19 patients need acute dialysis due to kidney failure. In this study, we address capacity planning decisions of a hemodialysis clinic located within a major hospital in Istanbul, designated to serve both infected and uninfected patients during the pandemic with limited resources (i.e., dialysis machines). The hemodialysis clinic applies a three-unit cohorting strategy to treat four types of patients in separate units and at different times to mitigate infection spread risk among patients. Accordingly, at the beginning of each week, the clinic needs to determine the number of available dialysis machines to allocate to each unit that serves different patient cohorts. Given the uncertainties in the number of different types of patients that will need dialysis, it is a challenge to allocate the scarce dialysis resources effectively by evaluating which capacity configuration would minimize the overlapping treatment sessions of infected and uninfected patients over a week. We represent the uncertainties in the number of patients by a set of scenarios and present a two-stage stochastic programming approach to support capacity allocation decisions of the clinic. We present a case study based on the real-world patient data obtained from the clinic to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach and compare the performance of different cohorting strategies.","Bozkir, Cem; Ozmemis, Cagri; Kurbanzade, Ali Kaan; Balcik, Burcu; Gunes, Evrim; Tuglular, Serhan",,278,24

We investigated the protective effect of the first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca non-replicating viral-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; AZD1222) and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA-based vaccine (BNT162b2) in residents of long-term care facilities in terms of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection over time since vaccination. METHODS: The VIVALDI study is a prospective cohort study that commenced recruitment on June 11, 2020, to investigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission, infection outcomes, and immunity in residents and staff in long-term care facilities in England that provide residential or nursing care for adults aged 65 years and older. In this cohort study, we included long-term care facility residents undergoing routine asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 testing between Dec 8, 2020 (the date the vaccine was first deployed in a long-term care facility), and March 15, 2021, using national testing data linked within the COVID-19 Datastore. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated the relative hazard of PCR-positive infection at 0-6 days, 7-13 days, 14-20 days, 21-27 days, 28-34 days, 35-48 days, and 49 days and beyond after vaccination, comparing unvaccinated and vaccinated person-time from the same cohort of residents, adjusting for age, sex, previous infection, local SARS-CoV-2 incidence, long-term care facility bed capacity, and clustering by long-term care facility. We also compared mean PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values for positive swabs obtained before and after vaccination. The study is registered with ISRCTN, number 14447421. FINDINGS: 10 412 care home residents aged 65 years and older from 310 LTCFs were included in this analysis. The median participant age was 86 years (IQR 80-91), 7247 (69·6%) of 10 412 residents were female, and 1155 residents (11·1%) had evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. 9160 (88·0%) residents received at least one vaccine dose, of whom 6138 (67·0%) received ChAdOx1 and 3022 (33·0%) received BNT162b2. Between Dec 8, 2020, and March 15, 2021, there were 36 352 PCR results in 670 628 person-days, and 1335 PCR-positive infections (713 in unvaccinated residents and 612 in vaccinated residents) were included. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for PCR-positive infection relative to unvaccinated residents declined from 28 days after the first vaccine dose to 0·44 (95% CI 0·24-0·81) at 28-34 days and 0·38 (0·19-0·77) at 35-48 days. Similar effect sizes were seen for ChAdOx1 (adjusted HR 0·32, 95% CI 0·15-0·66) and BNT162b2 (0·35, 0·17-0·71) vaccines at 35-48 days. Mean PCR Ct values were higher for infections that occurred at least 28 days after vaccination than for those occurring before vaccination (31·3 [SD 8·7] in 107 PCR-positive tests vs 26·6 [6·6] in 552 PCR-positive tests; p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Single-dose vaccination with BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines provides substantial protection against infection in older adults from 4-7 weeks after vaccination and might reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, the risk of infection is not eliminated, highlighting the ongoing need for non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent transmission in long-term care facilities.

However, long-standing observations of natural infections with old viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus and newer observations of emerging viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 responsible for COVID-19 suggest that immune immaturity may be beneficial for outcome. Mechanistic studies and studies of patients with inborn errors of immunity have revealed that immune dysregulation reflecting inappropriate antibody and T-cell responses plays a crucial role in causing bystander inflammation and more severe disease. Further evidence supports a role for innate immunity in normally regulating adaptive immune responses. Thus, changes in immune responses that normally occur with age may help explain an apparent protective role of immune immaturity during virus infections.","Shaw, Elana R; Su, Helen C",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,278,1

Diet has been identified as an environmental determinant of mental health. In this regard, it has been suggested that the consumption of palatable foods represents a strategy to mitigate negative emotions, such as anxiety. This study aimed to evaluate the association between symptoms of anxiety and/or anhedonia to food consumption patterns during the period of COVID-19 quarantine in Chile. We conducted a cross-sectional study with non-randomized sampling via an online survey. A total of 1725 responses were collected. Each person self-answered the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale for anhedonia, the Food Intake Questionnaire, and questions regarding type and duration of lockdown, as well as body weight and food serving variation. Significant correlations were observed between fried food consumption and self-reported body weight. The subjects who consumed fried food three times a week, had higher weight (63.5%) (&#967;2 = 48.5 and p < 0.001). Those who ate one and two or more pastries on a week had 1.41 and 1.49, respectively higher odds of reporting increased body weight.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using medical and pharmacy claims and enrollment information from US commercial and Medicare Advantage with Part D enrollees in the Optum Research Database from March 1, 2014, through April 30, 2019. Claims were linked with mortality data from the Social Security Death Index and the National Death Index. Eligible patients had &#8805;1 ICI claim between September 1, 2014 and April 30, 2019. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounding variables, we found patients with AEs had more than double the risk of an inpatient stay (HR, 2.2; 95% CI = 1.9-2.5) and an 80% higher risk of an emergency visit (HR, 1.8; 1.6-2.1) than patients without AEs. Adjusted 6-month total costs were $24,301 higher among patients with an AE versus those without ($99,037 versus $74,736, 95% CI = $18,828-$29,774, p < .001). Mean AE-related medical costs averaged $2359 (SD, $7496) per patient per month, driven by inpatient visits which accounted for 89.9% of AE-related costs. Adjusted risk of mortality was similar in patients with and without AEs. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AEs had higher risks of hospitalizations, ER visits, and higher healthcare costs, driven by inpatient stays, than patients without AEs. The adjusted risk of mortality was similar between the two cohorts. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Patients taking immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) who had adverse events (AEs) had significantly higher healthcare costs and utilization, driven by inpatient stays, compared to patients who did not. Given this high cost associated with AEs and the differences in the side effect profile of ICIs versus traditional chemotherapy, it is important for physicians to be cognizant of these differences when treating patients with ICIs. Ongoing evaluation, earlier recognition and more effective, multidisciplinary management of AEs may improve patient outcomes and reduce the need for costly inpatient stays.","George, Saby; Bell, Elizabeth J; Zheng, Ying; Kim, Ruth; White, John; Devgan, Geeta; Smith, Jodi; Lal, Lincy S; Engel-Nitz, Nicole M; Liu, Frank X",Oncologist,278,5

Among the excellent drug targets of SARS-CoV-2 are its proteases (Nsp3 and Nsp5) that plays vital role in polyprotein processing giving rise to functional nonstructural proteins, essential for viral replication and survival. Nsp5 (also known as Mpro) hydrolyzes replicase polyprotein (1ab) at eleven different sites. For targeting Mpro, we have employed drug repurposing approach to identify potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 in a shorter time span. Screening of approved drugs through docking reveals Hyaluronic acid and Acarbose among the top hits which are showing strong interactions with catalytic site residues of Mpro. We have also performed docking of drugs Lopinavir, Ribavirin, and Azithromycin on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Further, binding of these compounds (Hyaluronic acid, Acarbose, and Lopinavir) is validated by extensive molecular dynamics simulation of 500 ns where these drugs show stable binding with Mpro. We believe that the high-affinity binding of these compounds will help in designing novel strategies for structure-based drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Herein, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to find the association between COVID-19 and cardiovascular complications. We conducted a systematic literature search of the PubMed and Embase databases from 01 December 2019 to 30 November 2020. We then statistically analyzed the incidence of cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients. We included 3044 confirmed COVID-19 cases from 12 studies. The most common cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients were myocardial injury (21.2%, 95% CI 12.3-30.0%) and arrhythmia (15.3%, 95% CI 8.4-22.3%), followed by heart failure (14.4%, 95% CI 5.7-23.1%) and acute coronary syndrome (1.0%, 95% CI 0.5-1.5%). The pooled incidence of heart failure, arrhythmia and myocardial injury in non-survivors were 47.8% (95% CI 41.4-54.2%), 40.3% (95% CI 1.6-78.9%) and 61.7% (95% CI 46.8-76.6%), respectively. Also, the data separately showed significantly higher incidence of heart failure and cardiac injury in non-survivors (relative risks = 5.13, 95% CI 2.46-10.7, Z = 4.36, P = 0.017) and (relative risks = 6.91, 95% CI 3.19-14.95, Z = 4.91, P = 0.009). Myocardial injury and arrhythmia were the most common complications in COVID-19 patients. Myocardial injury and heart failure were more common in patients who died, regardless of a history of cardiovascular disease. The incidence of heart failure and myocardial injury were higher in non-survivors compared to the survivors. Accordingly, in addition to basic support, cardiac reactions of patients with confirmed COVID-19 with or without underlying cardiovascular diseases should be closely monitored.","Zhao, Yu-Hao; Zhao, Lei; Yang, Xin-Chun; Wang, Pan",Rev Cardiovasc Med,278,1

This study aims to uncouple inflammatory from fibrotic disease activity in fibroinflammatory diseases such as IgG4-related disease. METHODS: In this cross-sectional clinical study, 27 patients with inflammatory, fibrotic and overlapping manifestations of IgG4-related disease underwent positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with tracers specific for fibroblast activation protein (FAP; 68Ga-FAP inhibitor (FAPI)-04), 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), MRI and histopathological assessment. In a longitudinal approach, 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT data were evaluated before and after immunosuppressive treatment and correlated to clinical and MRI data. RESULTS: Using combination of 68Ga-FAPI-04 and 18F-FDG-PET, we demonstrate that non-invasive functional tracking of IgG4-related disease evolution from inflammatory towards a fibrotic outcome becomes feasible. 18F-FDG-PET positive lesions showed dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of IgG4 + cells in histology, while 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET positive lesions showed abundant activated fibroblasts expressing FAP according to results from RNA-sequencing of activated fibroblasts. The responsiveness of fibrotic lesions to anti-inflammatory treatment was far less pronounced than that of inflammatory lesions. CONCLUSION: FAP-specific PET/CT permits the discrimination between inflammatory and fibrotic activity in IgG4-related disease. This finding may profoundly change the management of certain forms of immune-mediated disease, such as IgG4-related disease, as subtypes dominated by fibrosis may require different approaches to control disease progression, for example, specific antifibrotic agents rather than broad spectrum anti-inflammatory treatments such as glucocorticoids.","Schmidkonz, Christian; Rauber, Simon; Atzinger, Armin; Agarwal, Rahul; Götz, Theresa Ida; Soare, Alina; Cordes, Michael; Prante, Olaf; Bergmann, Christina; Kleyer, Arnd; Ritt, Philipp; Maschauer, Simone; Hennig, Peter; Toms, Johannes; Köhner, Markus; Manger, Bernhard; Stone, John H; Haberkorn, Uwe; Baeuerle, Tobias; Distler, Jörg H W; Agaimy, Abbas; Kuwert, Torsten; Schett, Georg; Ramming, Andreas",Ann. rheum. dis,278,6

Major class of drugs that are targeted against RdRP are nucleotide analogues. Extensive docking and molecular dynamics study describing the binding of natural nucleotides (NTPs) and its analogues leading to significant structural variation in the RdRP has been presented here. RdRP simulations in its apo, NTP-bound, and analogue-bound form have been performed. Nucleotide analogues included in this study were, favipiravir, galidesivir, lamivudine, ribavirin, remdesivir and sofosbuvir. The conformational flexibility of the RdRP molecule has been explored using principal component (PCA) and Markov state modeling (MSM) analysis. PCA inferred the presence of correlated motions among the conserved motifs of RdRP. Inter-domain distances between the finger and thumb subdomain flanking the nascent RNA template entry site sampled open and closed conformations. The ligand and template binding motifs F and G showed negatively correlated motions. K551, R553, and R555, a part of motif F appear to form strong interactions with the ligand molecules. R836, a primer binding residue was observed to strongly bind to the analogues. MSM analysis helped to extract statistically distinct conformations explored by the RdRP. Ensemble docking of the ligands on the Markov states also suggested the involvement of the above residues in ligand interactions. Markov states obtained clearly demarcated the open/closed conformations of the template entry site. These observations on residues from the conserved motifs involved in binding to the ligands may provide an insight into designing new inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Understanding of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is still in its infancy. A 382-nt deletion strain lacking ORF8 (&#916;382 herein) was isolated in Singapore in March 2020. Infection with &#916;382 was associated with less severe disease in patients, compared to infection with wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Here, we established Nasal Epithelial cells (NECs) differentiated from healthy nasal-tissue derived stem cells as a suitable model for the ex-vivo study of SARS-CoV-2 mediated pathogenesis. Infection of NECs with either SARS-CoV-2 or &#916;382 resulted in virus particles released exclusively from the apical side, with similar replication kinetics. Screening of a panel of 49 cytokines for basolateral secretion from infected NECs identified CXCL10 as the only cytokine significantly induced upon infection, at comparable levels in both wild-type and &#916;382 infected cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed the temporal up-regulation of distinct gene subsets during infection, with anti-viral signaling pathways only detected at late time-points (72 hours post-infection, hpi). This immune response to SARS-CoV-2 was significantly attenuated when compared to infection with an influenza strain, H3N2, which elicited an inflammatory response within 8 hpi, and a greater magnitude of anti-viral gene up-regulation at late time-points. Remarkably, &#916;382 induced a host transcriptional response nearly identical to that of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 at every post-infection time-point examined. In accordance with previous results, &#916;382 infected cells showed an absence of transcripts mapping to ORF8, and conserved expression of other SARS-CoV-2 genes. Our findings shed light on the airway epithelial response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and demonstrate a non-essential role for ORF8 in modulating host gene expression and cytokine production from infected cells.","Gamage, Akshamal M; Tan, Kai Sen; Chan, Wharton O Y; Liu, Jing; Tan, Chee Wah; Ong, Yew Kwang; Thong, Mark; Andiappan, Anand K; Anderson, Danielle E; Wang, De Yun; Wang, Lin-Fa",PLoS Pathog,278,26

METHODS: This was a non-interventional multicenter prospective study carried out from 9 March to 3 May 2020 in two urology departments in Madrid, Spain. Clinical, microbiological and radiological data of patients who underwent surgery were collected from computerized medical records. RESULTS: A total of 148 patients were included in the study, and 141 were analyzed for nosocomial infection risk, after excluding previous and concomitant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 infections. Elective surgeries represented 76.6% of the procedures, whereas emergent surgeries represented 23.4%. Preoperative screening was carried out with polymerase chain reaction test in 34 patients, all were negative. A total of 14 patients also had chest X-ray (not suspicious in all cases). Three patients (2.1%) developed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 nosocomial infection (symptoms developed between the third day after surgery to the 14th day after hospital discharge). Time from admission to a compatible clinical case was 5.5 days (4-12 days). Two patients underwent surgery with concomitant diagnosis of coronavirus disease. The mortality rate due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 infection is 0.7%, and the specific mortality rate in patients undergoing surgery with community-acquired coronavirus disease 2019 infection was 50% (1/2). CONCLUSIONS: The nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 infection rate was low in patients undergoing urological surgical procedures during the peak of the pandemic in Madrid. With appropriate perioperative screening, urological surgical activity can be carried out in safety conditions.","Sánchez, María Dolores; Sánchez, Miguel; De La Morena, José Manuel; Ogaya-Pinies, Gabriel; Mateo, Erika; Moscatiello, Pietro; Sánchez, Susana; Rubio, Victor; Bueno, Carolina; Barba, Raquel; Carracedo, David",Int. j. urol,278,20

Time for some unpopular decisions,14.521923,12.00792,2020,"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 relies on transfer of anti-viral antibody from donors to recipients via plasma transfusion. The relationship between clinical characteristics and antibody response to COVID-19 is not well defined. We investigated predictors of convalescent antibody production and quantified recipient antibody response in a convalescent plasma therapy clinical trial. METHODS: Multivariable analysis of clinical and serological parameters in 103 confirmed COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors 28 days or more following symptom resolution was performed. Mixed-effects regression models with piecewise linear trends were used to characterize serial antibody responses in 10 convalescent plasma recipients with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Donor antibody titres ranged from 0 to 1 : 3892 (anti-receptor binding domain (RBD)) and 0 to 1 : 3289 (anti-spike). Higher anti-RBD and anti-spike titres were associated with increased age, hospitalization for COVID-19, fever and absence of myalgia (all P < 0.05). Fatigue was significantly associated with anti-RBD (P = 0.03). In pairwise comparison amongst ABO blood types, AB donors had higher anti-RBD and anti-spike than O donors (P < 0.05). No toxicity was associated with plasma transfusion. Non-ECMO recipient anti-RBD antibody titre increased on average 31% per day during the first three days post-transfusion (P = 0.01) and anti-spike antibody titre by 40.3% (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Advanced age, fever, absence of myalgia, fatigue, blood type and hospitalization were associated with higher convalescent antibody titre to COVID-19. Despite variability in donor titre, 80% of convalescent plasma recipients showed significant increase in antibody levels post-transfusion. A more complete understanding of the dose-response effect of plasma transfusion amongst COVID-19-infected patients is needed.","Madariaga, M L L; Guthmiller, J J; Schrantz, S; Jansen, M O; Christensen, C; Kumar, M; Prochaska, M; Wool, G; Durkin-Celauro, A; Oh, W H; Trockman, L; Vigneswaran, J; Keskey, R; Shaw, D G; Dugan, H; Zheng, N-Y; Cobb, M; Utset, H; Wang, J; Stovicek, O; Bethel, C; Matushek, S; Giurcanu, M; Beavis, K G; di Sabato, D; Meltzer, D; Ferguson, M K; Kress, J P; Shanmugarajah, K; Matthews, J B; Fung, J F; Wilson, P C; Alverdy, J C; Donington, J S",J. intern. med,278,24

Here we use single-cell analysis to elucidate the cell types, development, renewal and evolution of the alveolar capillary endothelium. We show that alveolar capillaries are mosaics; similar to the epithelium that lines the alveolus, the alveolar endothelium is made up of two intermingled cell types, with complex 'Swiss-cheese'-like morphologies and distinct functions. The first cell type, which we term the 'aerocyte', is specialized for gas exchange and the trafficking of leukocytes, and is unique to the lung. The other cell type, termed gCap ('general' capillary), is specialized to regulate vasomotor tone, and functions as a stem/progenitor cell in capillary homeostasis and repair. The two cell types develop from bipotent progenitors, mature gradually and are affected differently in disease and during ageing. This cell-type specialization is conserved between mouse and human lungs but is not found in alligator or turtle lungs, suggesting it arose during the evolution of the mammalian lung. The discovery of cell type specialization in alveolar capillaries transforms our understanding of the structure, function, regulation and maintenance of the air-blood barrier and gas exchange in health, disease and evolution.","Gillich, Astrid; Zhang, Fan; Farmer, Colleen G; Travaglini, Kyle J; Tan, Serena Y; Gu, Mingxia; Zhou, Bin; Feinstein, Jeffrey A; Krasnow, Mark A; Metzger, Ross J",Nature,278,1

The compliance with vaccination has differed between sectors in Israel and the uptake has been substantially lower in the Arab compared with the Jewish population. AIM: To assess ethnic and socio-demographic factors in Israel associated with attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines prior to their introduction. METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey was carried out In Israel during October 2020 using an internet panel of around 100,000 people, supplemented by snowball sampling. A sample of 957 adults aged 30 and over were recruited of whom 606 were Jews (49% males) and 351 were Arabs (38% males). RESULTS: The sample of Arabs was younger than for the Jewish respondents. Among the men, 27.3% of the Jewish and 23.1% of the Arab respondents wanted to be vaccinated immediately, compared with only 13.6% of Jewish women and 12.0% of Arab women. An affirmative answer to the question as to whether they would refuse the vaccine at any stage was given by 7.7% of Jewish men and 29.9% of Arab men, and 17.2% of Jewish women and 41.0% of Arab women. Higher education was associated with less vaccine hesitancy. In multiple logistic regression analysis, the ethnic and gender differences persisted after controlling for age and education. Other factors associated with vaccine hesitancy were the belief that the government restrictions were too lenient and the frequency of socializing prior to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed a relatively high percentage reported would be reluctant to get vaccinated, prior to the introduction of the vaccine. This was more marked so for Arabs then Jews, and more so for women within the ethnic groups. While this was not a true random sample, the findings are consistent with the large ethnic differences in compliance with the vaccine, currently encountered and reinforce the policy implications for developing effective communication to increase vaccine adherence. Government policies directed at controlling the pandemic should include sector-specific information campaigns, which are tailored to ensure community engagement, using targeted messages to the suspected vaccine hesitant groups. Government ministries, health service providers and local authorities should join hands with civil society organizations to promote vaccine promotion campaigns.","Green, Manfred S; Abdullah, Rania; Vered, Shiraz; Nitzan, Dorit",Isr J Health Policy Res,278,1

We therefore aimed to assess the effects of vaccine characteristics, information on herd immunity, and general practitioner (GP) recommendation on vaccine hesitancy in a representative working-age population in France. METHODS: In this survey experiment, adults aged 18-64 years residing in France, with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, were randomly selected from an online survey research panel in July, 2020, stratified by gender, age, education, household size, and region and area of residence to be representative of the French population. Participants completed an online questionnaire on their background and vaccination behaviour-related variables (including past vaccine compliance, risk factors for severe COVID-19, and COVID-19 perceptions and experience), and were then randomly assigned according to a full factorial design to one of three groups to receive differing information on herd immunity (>50% of adults aged 18-64 years must be immunised [either by vaccination or infection]; >50% of adults must be immunised [either by vaccination or infection]; or no information on herd immunity) and to one of two groups regarding GP recommendation of vaccination (GP recommends vaccination or expresses no opinion). Participants then completed a series of eight discrete choice tasks designed to assess vaccine acceptance or refusal based on hypothetical vaccine characteristics (efficacy [50%, 80%, 90%, or 100%], risk of serious side-effects [1 in 10â000 or 1 in 100â000], location of manufacture [EU, USA, or China], and place of administration [GP practice, local pharmacy, or mass vaccination centre]). Responses were analysed with a two-part model to disentangle outright vaccine refusal (irrespective of vaccine characteristics, defined as opting for no vaccination in all eight tasks) from vaccine hesitancy (acceptance depending on vaccine characteristics). FINDINGS: Survey responses were collected from 1942 working-age adults, of whom 560 (28·8%) opted for no vaccination in all eight tasks (outright vaccine refusal) and 1382 (71·2%) did not. In our model, outright vaccine refusal and vaccine hesitancy were both significantly associated with female gender, age (with an inverted U-shaped relationship), lower educational level, poor compliance with recommended vaccinations in the past, and no report of specified chronic conditions (ie, no hypertension [for vaccine hesitancy] or no chronic conditions other than hypertension [for outright vaccine refusal]). Outright vaccine refusal was also associated with a lower perceived severity of COVID-19, whereas vaccine hesitancy was lower when herd immunity benefits were communicated and in working versus non-working individuals, and those with experience of COVID-19 (had symptoms or knew someone with COVID-19). For a mass vaccination campaign involving mass vaccination centres and communication of herd immunity benefits, our model predicted outright vaccine refusal in 29·4% (95% CI 28·6-30·2) of the French working-age population. Predicted hesitancy was highest for vaccines manufactured in China with 50% efficacy and a 1 in 10â000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 27·4% [26·8-28·0]), and lowest for a vaccine manufactured in the EU with 90% efficacy and a 1 in 100â000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 61·3% [60·5-62·1]). INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 vaccine acceptance depends on the characteristics of new vaccines and the national vaccination strategy, among various other factors, in the working-age population in France.

The most affected European countries are, so far, Italy and Spain. In both countries (and others), the authorities decreed a lockdown, with local specificities. The objective of this work is to evaluate the impact of the measures undertaken in Spain to deal with the pandemic. METHOD: We estimated the number of cases and the impact of lockdown on the reproducibility number based on the hospitalization reports up to April 15th 2020. RESULTS: The estimated number of cases shows a sharp increase until the lockdown, followed by a slowing down and then a decrease after full quarantine was implemented. Differences in the basic reproduction ratio are also significant, dropping from 5.89 (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 5.46-7.09) before the lockdown to 0.48 (95%CI: 0.15-1.17) afterwards. CONCLUSIONS: Handling a pandemic like COVID-19 is complex and requires quick decision making. The large differences found in the speed of propagation of the disease show us that being able to implement interventions at the earliest stage is crucial to minimise the impact of a potential infectious threat. Our work also stresses the importance of reliable up to date epidemiological data in order to accurately assess the impact of Public Health policies on viral outbreak.","Hyafil, Alexandre; Moriña, David","Gac. sanit.

A binary integer optimization model is developed in order to find the best allocation for ICU beds, considering candidate patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19. Experts' subjective knowledge and prior probabilities are considered to estimate the input data for the proposed model, considering the particular aspects of the decision problem. Since the chances of survival of patients in several scenarios may not be precisely defined due to the inherent subjectivity of such kinds of information, the proposed model works based on imprecise information provided by users.

METHODS: Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted in April, June and August 2020 in low- and high-transmission neighbourhoods. Participants were selected at random to provide blood for Elecsys immunoassay for detection of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibodies. A Bayesian regression model was used to estimate seroprevalence after adjusting for the demographic characteristics of each district. RESULTS: In total, 3005 participants from 623 households were enrolled in this study. In Phase 2, adjusted seroprevalence was estimated as 8.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.1-13.1] and 15.1% (95% CI 9.4-21.7) in low- and high-transmission areas, respectively, compared with 0.2% (95% CI 0-0.7) and 0.4% (95% CI 0-1.3) in Phase 1. In Phase 3, it was 12.8% (95% CI 8.3-17.7) and 21.5% (95% CI 15.6-28) in low- and high-transmission areas, respectively. The conditional risk of infection was 0.31 (95% CI 0.16-0.47) and 0.41 (95% CI 0.28-0.52) in low- and high-transmission neighbourhoods, respectively, in Phase 2. Similar trends were observed in Phase 3. Only 5.4% of participants who tested positive for COVID-19 were symptomatic. The infection fatality rate was 1.66%, 0.37% and 0.26% in Phases 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. METHODS: We collected individual information from official public sources on laboratory-confirmed cases reported outside Hubei in mainland China for the period of Jan 19 to Feb 17, 2020. We used the date of the fourth revision of the case definition (Jan 27) to divide the epidemic into two time periods (Dec 24 to Jan 27, and Jan 28 to Feb 17) as the date of symptom onset. We estimated trends in the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. FINDINGS: We collected data on 8579 cases from 30 provinces. The median age of cases was 44 years (33-56), with an increasing proportion of cases in younger age groups and in elderly people (ie, aged >64 years) as the epidemic progressed. The mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4·4 days (95% CI 0·0-14·0) for the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 2·6 days (0·0-9·0) for the period of Jan 28 to Feb 17. The mean incubation period for the entire period was estimated at 5·2 days (1·8-12·4) and the mean serial interval at 5·1 days (1·3-11·6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei were highly variable but consistently included a mixture of case importations and local transmission. We estimated that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than 3 weeks, with mean Rt reaching peaks between 1·08 (95% CI 0·74-1·54) in Shenzhen city of Guangdong province and 1·71 (1·32-2·17) in Shandong province. In all the locations for which we had sufficient data coverage of Rt, Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold (ie, <1) after Jan 30. INTERPRETATION: Our estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were similar, suggesting an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of symptoms. Our results also indicate that, as the epidemic progressed, infectious individuals were isolated more quickly, thus shortening the window of transmission in the community. Overall, our findings indicate that strict containment measures, movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population might have contributed to interrupt local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside Hubei province.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study is a large case series, and data were obtained regarding consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Central Hospital of Wuhan between 2 January and 15 February 2020. All patients with definite outcomes (death or discharge) were included. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory information were extracted from electronic medical records. We collected daily fasting glucose data from standard morning fasting blood biochemistry to determine glycemic status and fluctuation (calculated as the square root of the variance of daily fasting glucose levels) during the 1st week of hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 548 patients were included in the study (median age 57 years; 298 [54%] were women, and n = 99 had diabetes [18%]), 215 suffered acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 489 survived, and 59 died. Patients who had higher mean levels of glucose during their 1st week of hospitalization were older and more likely to have a comorbidity and abnormal laboratory markers, prolonged hospital stays, increased expenses, and greater risks of severe pneumonia, ARDS, and death. Compared with patients with the lowest quartile of glycemic fluctuation, those who had the highest quartile of fluctuation magnitude had an increased risk of ARDS (risk ratio 1.97 [95% CI 1.01, 4.04]) and mortality (hazard ratio 2.73 [95% CI 1.06, 7.73]).

We interviewed ED leaders who implemented telehealth programs to inform responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future emergencies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September-November 2020, we conducted semi-structured interviews with ED leaders across the United States. We identified EDs with pandemic-related telehealth programs through literature review and snowball sampling. Maximum variation sampling was used to capture a range of experiences. We used standard qualitative analysis techniques, consisting of both inductive and deductive approaches to identify and characterize themes. RESULTS: We completed 15 interviews with EDs leaders in 10 states. From March-November 2020, participants experimented with more than a dozen different types of telehealth applications including tele-isolation, tele-triage, tele-consultation, virtual post-discharge assessment, acute care in the home, and tele-palliative care. Prior experience with telehealth was key for implementation of new applications. Most new telehealth applications turned out to be temporary because they were no longer needed to support the response. The leading barriers to telehealth implementation during the pandemic included technology challenges and the need for ""hands-on"" implementation support in the ED. CONCLUSIONS: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, EDs rapidly implemented many telehealth innovations.

Making use of a structural estimation model of labour market dynamics, we estimate differences in market power that workers face depending on their sector of activity, their age, sex, location and educational level. In particular, we show that differences in cross-sectional market power are significant and higher than variations over the ten-year time span of our data. In contrast to findings of labour market power in developed countries such as the US, we document significant market power of employers in Peru vis-\`a-vis the tertiary educated workforce, regardless of age and sector. In contrast, for the primary educated workforce, market power seems to be high in (private) services and manufacturing. For secondary educated workers, only the mining sector stands out as moderately more monopsonistic than the rest of the labour market. We also show that at least for the 2010s, labour market power declined in Peru. We contrast these findings with similar estimates obtained for the United States where we are able to show that increases in labour market power are particularly acute in certain sectors, such as agriculture and entertainment and recreational services, as well as in specific geographic areas where these sectors are dominant. Moreover, we show that for the US, the labour market power has gradually increased over the past ten years, in line with the general rise in inequality. Importantly, we show that the pervasive gender pay gap cannot be linked to differential market power as men face higher labour market power than women. We also discuss possible reasons for these findings, including for the differences of labour market power across skill levels. Especially, we discuss the reasons for polarization of market power that are specific to sectors and locations.","Davalos, Jorge; Ernst, Ekkehard",,278,24

An online population survey assessing sleep and mental health was distributed between 3 April and 24 June 2020. Retrospective questions were used to estimate temporal changes from before to during the outbreak. In 5,525 Canadian respondents (67.1% females, 16-95 years old: Mean ± SDâ =â 55.6 ± 16.3 years), wake-up times were significantly delayed relative to pre-outbreak estimates (p < .001, Î· p 2 = 0.04).

The ""Reduced Time in Bed"" and ""Delayed Sleep"" subgroups had more adverse sleep outcomes and psychological changes during the outbreak. The emergence of new sleep difficulties was independently associated with female sex, chronic illnesses, being employed, family responsibilities, earlier wake-up times, higher stress levels, as well as heavier alcohol use and television exposure.

Two different uptake rates were specified: (1) surge uptake (VS ) after starvation and (2) maintenance uptake with filled nutrient pools (VM ). VS for DIP of 1.57±0.29 µmol · cm-2 · d-1 and DIN of 15.6±4.3 µmol · cm-2 · d-1 , as well as VM for DIP of 0.57±0.22 µmol · cm-2 · d-1 and DIN of 5.6±2.1 µmol · cm-2 · d-1 were calculated. In addition, an absolute size of the internal storage capacity (ISC) for DIP of 22 µmol · cm2 and DIN of 222 µmol · cm2 was determined. A DIP to DIN uptake ratio of 1:10 under VM showed a weekly rhythmic uptake pattern, highlighted by a high correlation between DIP and DIN uptake (R=0.943). VS for DIN did not occur under DIP depletion, but uptake rates increased with increasing DIP availability. Hence, DIP availability limited access to DIN, which was also reflected by total dissolvable protein concentrations in sporophytes, which ranged from 10.2±2.5% to 24.6±8.0% dry weight depending on DIP availability. Similarly, total dissolvable carbohydrate concentration ranged from 22.1±3.6% to 54.3±12.3% dry weight.

This disease is caused by a novel coronavirus termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This work focuses on the applications of machine learning algorithms in the context of COVID-19. Firstly, regression analysis is performed to model the number of confirmed cases and death cases. Our experiments show that autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) can reliably model the increase in the number of confirmed cases and can predict future cases. Secondly, a number of classifiers are used to predict whether a COVID-19 patient needs to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) or semi-ICU. For this, classification algorithms are applied to a dataset having 5644 samples. Using this dataset, the most significant attributes are selected using features selection by ExtraTrees classifier, and Proteina C reativa (mg/dL) is found to be the highest-ranked feature. In our experiments, random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine, XGBoost, stacking and voting classifiers are applied to the top 10 selected attributes of the dataset. Results show that random forest and hard voting classifiers achieve the highest classification accuracy values near 98%, and the highest recall value of 98% in predicting the need for admission into ICU / semi-ICU units.","Podder, P.; Khamparia, A.; Mondal, M.

There are no antiviral drugs with proven clinical efficacy for the treatment of COVID-19, nor are there any vaccines that prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, and efforts to develop drugs and vaccines are hampered by the limited knowledge of the molecular details of how SARS-CoV-2 infects cells. Here we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins that physically associated with each of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins using affinity-purification mass spectrometry, identifying 332 high-confidence protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins. Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 compounds (of which, 29 drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, 12 are in clinical trials and 28 are preclinical compounds). We screened a subset of these in multiple viral assays and found two sets of pharmacological agents that displayed antiviral activity: inhibitors of mRNA translation and predicted regulators of the sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors. Further studies of these host-factor-targeting agents, including their combination with drugs that directly target viral enzymes, could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat COVID-19.","Gordon, David E; Jang, Gwendolyn M; Bouhaddou, Mehdi; Xu, Jiewei; Obernier, Kirsten; White, Kris M; O039,; Meara, Matthew J; Rezelj, Veronica V; Guo, Jeffrey Z; Swaney, Danielle L; Tummino, Tia A; Hüttenhain, Ruth; Kaake, Robyn M; Richards, Alicia L; Tutuncuoglu, Beril; Foussard, Helene; Batra, Jyoti; Haas, Kelsey; Modak, Maya; Kim, Minkyu; Haas, Paige; Polacco, Benjamin J; Braberg, Hannes; Fabius, Jacqueline M; Eckhardt, Manon; Soucheray, Margaret; Bennett, Melanie J; Cakir, Merve; McGregor, Michael J; Li, Qiongyu; Meyer, Bjoern; Roesch, Ferdinand; Vallet, Thomas; Mac Kain, Alice; Miorin, Lisa; Moreno, Elena; Naing, Zun Zar Chi; Zhou, Yuan; Peng, Shiming; Shi, Ying; Zhang, Ziyang; Shen, Wenqi; Kirby, Ilsa T; Melnyk, James E; Chorba, John S; Lou, Kevin; Dai, Shizhong A; Barrio-Hernandez, Inigo; Memon, Danish; Hernandez-Armenta, Claudia",Nature,278,1

Repurposing existing drugs is one viable approach that emphasizes speed during these urgent times. Famotidine, a class A G protein-coupled receptor antagonist used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux was recently identified in an in silico screening. Additionally, a recent retrospective clinical report showed that the treatment with famotidine provided a good outcome in patients infected with SARS-CoV2. A clinical trial testing effectiveness of famotidine in combination with hydroxychloroquine is currently ongoing in the United States (US). In the 1990s, famotidine was described as an antiviral agent against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Interestingly, some HIV protease inhibitors are presently being used against SARS-CoV2. However, it is not clear if famotidine could be effective against SARS-CoV2. Thus, by using a computational analysis, we aimed to examine if the antiviral effect of famotidine could be related to the inhibition of proteases involved in the virus replication. Our results showed that famotidine could interact within the catalytic site of the three proteases associated with SARS-CoV2 replication. However, weak binding affinity of famotidine to these proteases suggests that a successful famotidine therapy could likely be achieved only in combination with other antiviral drugs. Finally, analysis of famotidine's pharmacokinetic parameters indicated that its effect against SARS-CoV2 infection could be reached only upon intravenous administration. This work will contribute to the pharmacological knowledge of famotidine as an antiviral agent against SARS-CoV2.","Ortega, Joseph T; Serrano, Maria Luisa; Jastrzebska, Beata",Biomolecules,278,16

Viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19,14.448819,12.150378,2020,"BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a challenge for medical personnel, especially in the current COVID-19 pandemic, where medical personnel should perform resuscitation wearing full personal protective equipment. This study aims were to assess the characteristics and outcomes of adults who suffered an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the COVID-19 pandemic treated by emergency medical service (EMS) teams. METHODS: All EMS-attended OHCA adults over than 18 years in the Polish EMS registry were analyzed. The retrospective EMS database was conducted. EMS interventions performed between March 1, and April 30, 2020 were retrospectively screened. RESULTS: In the study period EMS operated 527 times for OHCA cases. The average age of patients with OHCA was 67.8 years. Statistically significantly more frequently men were involved (64.3%). 298 (56.6%) of all OHCA patients had resuscitation attempted by EMS providers. Among resuscitated patients, 73.8% were cardiac etiology. 9.4% of patients had return of spontaneous circulation, 27.2% of patients were admitted to hospital with ongoing chest compression. In the case of 63.4% cardiopulmonary resuscitation was ineffective and death was determined. CONCLUSIONS: The present study found that OHCA incidence rate in the Masovian population (central region of Poland) in March-April 2020 period was 12.2/100,000 adult inhabitants. Return of spontaneous circulation in EMS was observed only in 9.4% of resuscitated patients. The presence of shockable rhythms was associated with better prognosis. The prehospital mortality, even though it was high, did not differ from those reported by other studies.","Borkowska, Magdalena J; Smereka, Jacek; Safiejko, Kamil; Nadolny, Klaudiusz; Maslanka, Maciej; Filipiak, Krzysztof J; Jaguszewski, Milosz J; Szarpak, Lukasz",Cardiol j (Print),278,1

A subset of children, however, present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death. The immune features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly understood. We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission. A distinct feature of MIS-C patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells that correlated with the use of vasoactive medication. Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time, concomitant with decreasing immune activation. Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures that are temporally distinct from one another and implicate CD8+ T cells in the clinical presentation and trajectory of MIS-C.","Vella, Laura A; Giles, Josephine R; Baxter, Amy E; Oldridge, Derek A; Diorio, Caroline; Kuri-Cervantes, Leticia; Alanio, Cécile; Pampena, M Betina; Wu, Jennifer E; Chen, Zeyu; Huang, Yinghui Jane; Anderson, Elizabeth M; Gouma, Sigrid; McNerney, Kevin O; Chase, Julie; Burudpakdee, Chakkapong; Lee, Jessica H; Apostolidis, Sokratis A; Huang, Alexander C; Mathew, Divij; Kuthuru, Oliva; Goodwin, Eileen C; Weirick, Madison E; Bolton, Marcus J; Arevalo, Claudia P; Ramos, Andre; Jasen, C J; Conrey, Peyton E; Sayed, Samir; Giannini, Heather M; D039,; Andrea, Kurt; Meyer, Nuala J; Behrens, Edward M; Bassiri, Hamid; Hensley, Scott E; Henrickson, Sarah E; Teachey, David T; Betts, Michael R; Wherry, E John",Sci. immunol,278,26

Standard sonification methods reported in the literature involve either (i) using only a subset of the variables, or (ii) first solving a learning task on the data and then mapping the output to an audio waveform, which is utilized by the end-user to make a decision. This paper presents a novel framework for sonifying high-dimensional data using a complex growth transform dynamical system model where both the learning (or, more generally, optimization) and the sonification processes are integrated together. Our algorithm takes as input the data and optimization parameters underlying the learning or prediction task and combines it with the psychoacoustic parameters defined by the user. As a result, the proposed framework outputs binaural audio signatures that not only encode some statistical properties of the high-dimensional data but also reveal the underlying complexity of the optimization/learning process. Along with extensive experiments using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the framework on sonifying Electro-encephalogram (EEG) data with the potential for detecting epileptic seizures in pediatric patients.","Chatterjee, Oindrila; Chakrabartty, Shantanu",,278,20

Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak could alter their psychological state. The objective was to analyze the psychological impact of the pandemic and confinement on stress levels and psychopathological symptoms in patients with SLE. Patients and method: In this cross-sectional study, stress levels were compared with the Perceived Stress Scale, the Stress Vulnerability Inventory and psychopathological symptoms of the SCL-90-R Symptom Inventory in patients with SLE during the period of confinement (group 1; n = 276) in comparison to patients with SLE evaluated in a period before the pandemic (group 2; n = 152). Results: The comparison between both groups showed there were statistically significant differences in vulnerability to stress (p < 0.0001), depression (p &#8804; 0.05), anxiety (p &#8804; 0.05), phobic anxiety (p < 0.0001), interpersonal sensitivity (p &#8804; 0.043), and psychoticism (p &#8804; 0.023). In these variables, the group of patients with lupus in confinement obtained higher scores. Conclusions: The confinement and threat of the COVID-19 outbreak had important repercussions on the psychological state of patients with SLE with high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. These findings show their vulnerability to a public health alert and indicate the need to carry out a psychological approach to these patients while the state of health emergency lasts as well as to possible outbreaks of the virus.","Santos-Ruiz, Ana; Montero-López, Eva; Ortego-Centeno, Norberto; Peralta-Ramírez, María Isabel",,278,32

Effective nursing care includes actions to develop nurse-patient relationships and deliver physical and psychosocial care to patients. The high risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus compromises nursing care. No evidence-based nursing guidelines exist for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, leading to potential variations in patient experience, outcomes, quality and costs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: we aim to recruit 840 in-patient participants treated for infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus from 14 UK hospitals, to a cluster randomised controlled trial, with embedded process and economic evaluations, of care as usual and a fundamental nursing care protocol addressing specific areas of physical, relational and psychosocial nursing care where potential variation may occur, compared with care as usual. Our coprimary outcomes are patient-reported experience (Quality from the Patients' Perspective; Relational Aspects of Care Questionnaire); secondary outcomes include care quality (pressure injuries, falls, medication errors); functional ability (Barthell Index); treatment outcomes (WHO Clinical Progression Scale); depression Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), anxiety General Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2), health utility (EQ5D) and nurse-reported outcomes (Measure of Moral Distress for Health Care Professionals). For our primary analysis, we will use a standard generalised linear mixed-effect model adjusting for ethnicity of the patient sample and research intensity at cluster level.

This study describes the characteristics of healthcare workers (HCWs) who tested positive for COVID-19 in a tertiary care hospital in Oman. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional descriptive analysis of HCWs with COVID-19. RESULTS: During the study period, 204 HCWs tested positive for COVID-19 by rRT-PCR test, with a test positivity rate of 21.2%; the percentage of infected hospital staff was 4.3%. Their mean age was 36 years. Overall, 2.2% of the male staff were infected, while 9.3% of the female staff were infected. Among the clinicians, 4.7% were infected; among the nurses, 4.1% were infected. Regarding acquisition, 61.3% of infections (n = 125) were community-acquired and 25.5% (n = 52) were hospital-acquired; no source was identified in 13.2% of cases (n = 27). There was a significant difference between hospital-acquired and community-acquired COVID-19 according to the different HCW categories (p < 0.001), sex (p = 0.041), and being at risk of COVID-19 exposure in the hospital (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in relation to nationality (p = 0498), age (p = 0.119), or the presence of co-morbidities (p = 0.326). Seventy-eight percent (n = 160) had no chronic diseases and 44% presented with fever and an acute respiratory infection (n = 90); all made an uneventful full recovery. The peak of infection acquisition was after the Eid Al Fitr festival. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs are at an increased risk of COVID-19 in the workplace. The strengthening of infection control measures to prevent exposures from infected patients and colleagues and to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is a necessity.","Al Maskari, Zaina; Al Blushi, Ahlam; Khamis, Faryal; Al Tai, Amal; Al Salmi, Issa; Al Harthi, Hasina; Al Saadi, Muzna; Al Mughairy, Ameera; Gutierrez, Ricky; Al Blushi, Zakariya",Int J Infect Dis,278,8

While previous studies examine conspiracy theories in the context of social media, they have not evaluated their presence in the new space of generative language models. In this work, we investigate the capability of language models to generate conspiracy theory text. Specifically, we aim to answer: can we test pretrained generative language models for the memorization and elicitation of conspiracy theories without access to the model's training data? We highlight the difficulties of this task and discuss it in the context of memorization, generalization, and hallucination. Utilizing a new dataset consisting of conspiracy theory topics and machine-generated conspiracy theories helps us discover that many conspiracy theories are deeply rooted in the pretrained language models. Our experiments demonstrate a relationship between model parameters such as size and temperature and their propensity to generate conspiracy theory text. These results indicate the need for a more thorough review of NLG applications before release and an in-depth discussion of the drawbacks of memorization in generative language models.","Levy, Sharon; Saxon, Michael; Wang, William Yang",,278,16

During the last decades, various biomolecules, including amino acids, have been successfully used as reducing and capping agents to synthesize multi-shaped gold nanostructures. A grand challenge in this field is to increase our ability to control the size and shape of gold nanostructures formed precisely by systematic synthetic approaches based on the understanding of the mechanism for structural determination. In this study, using glycine as the model amino acid and chloroaurate (AuCl4 -) ions as the precursor solution, we report the finding that the shape of the gold nanostructures synthesized showed a strong correlation with the speciation of gold complexes determined by the pH, precursor concentration and chloride concentration of the solvent system. The gold chloro-hydroxy speciation [AuClx(OH)4-x]- (with x = 0-4) influenced the shape of the gold nanostructures formed, with gold nanoplatelets, nanotriangles, nanokites and nanoribbons observed at x = 4, 3, 2 and 1, respectively, and spherical nanoparticles observed at x = 0. Glycine was found to play a role as a reducing agent, but no significant effect on the morphology was observed, indicating the dominance of gold chloro-hydroxy speciation in the structural formation. These results collectively provide synthetic considerations to systematically synthesize non-spherical to spherical biosynthesized gold nanostructures by controlling the speciation of [AuClx(OH)4-x]-.","Lee, Joun; Kim, Sanggon; Mubeen, Syed; Mulchandani, Ashok; Chen, Wilfred; Choa, Yongho; Myung, Nosang V",Nanotechnology,278,16

Due to the stricter outbreak control, the levels of PM 2.5and VOCs, and the occurrence frequencies of haze-fog episodes decreased substantially from NCP to CP, with average reduction rates of 31.6%, 38.9% and 35.1% at PD, and 34.5%, 50.7% and 37.9% at DSL, respectively. The major source for PM 2.5was secondary sulfate & nitrate in both periods, and the emission control of primary sources such as coal burning and vehicle exhaust decreased the levels of precursors gas sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which highly contributed to the abatement of PM 2.5from NCP to CP. The higher levels of ozone at both PD and DSL on CP might be due to the weak nitrogen monoxide titration, low relative humidity and high visibility compared with NCP. Vehicle exhaust and fugitive emission from petrochemical industry were the major contributors of ambient VOCs and their decreasing activities mainly accounted for VOCs abatement. Moreover, the high frequency of haze-fog events was closely impacted by medium-scale regional transport within Anhui and Jiangsu provinces. Therefore, the decreasing regional transported air pollutants coincided with the emission control of local sources to cause the abatement of haze-fog events in YRD region on CP. This study could improve the understanding of the change of atmospheric pollutants during the outbreak control period, and provide scientific base for haze-fog pollution control in YRD region, China.","Jia, Haohao; Huo, Juntao; Fu, Qingyan; Duan, Yusen; Lin, Yanfen; Jin, Xiaodan; Hu, Xue; Cheng, Jinping",Environ.

Therefore, it becomes imperative to explore and develop new antiviral compounds continually. The search for pharmacological substances of plant origin that are effective against animal viruses, which have a high mortality rate or cause large economic losses, has garnered interest in the last few decades. This systematic review compiles 130 plant species that exhibit antiviral activity on 37 different virus species causing serious diseases in animals. The kind of extract, fraction, or compound exhibiting the antiviral activity and the design of the trial were particularly considered for review. The literature revealed details regarding plant species exhibiting antiviral activities against pathogenic animal virus species of the following families-Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, Poxviridae, Nimaviridae, Coronaviridae, Reoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae-that cause infections, among others, in poultry, cattle, pigs, horses, shrimps, and fish. Overall, 30 plant species exhibited activity against various influenza viruses, most of them causing avian influenza. Furthermore, 30 plant species were noted to be active against Newcastle disease virus. In addition, regarding the pathogens most frequently investigated, this review provides a compilation of 20 plant species active against bovine herpesvirus, 16 against fowlpox virus, 12 against white spot syndrome virus in marine shrimps, and 10 against suide herpesvirus. Nevertheless, some plant extracts, particularly their compounds, are promising candidates for the development of new antiviral remedies, which are urgently required.","Zitterl-Eglseer, Karin; Marschik, Tatiana",Planta med,278,17

Bimetallic catalysts are a kind of promising candidates, like the hybrids of Co and VN nanoparticles (Co/VN). However, the inevitable aggregation during the preparation and electrochemical process lowers their reactivity and durability. Herein, small Co/VN nanoparticles (4-8 nm) embedded in porous graphitic carbon layers (Co/VN NPs@C) were obtained through the pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The synergistic effect of in situ generated Co and VN NPs together with fast electron transfer from graphitic carbon layers renders this catalyst to possess excellent trifunctional performance. More attractively, Co/VN NPs@C as both the anode and the cathode shows a low voltage of 1.58 V when the current density is up to 10 mA cm-2, exceeding most electrocatalysts based on non-noble metals. The rechargeable Zn-air batteries constructed by Co/VN NPs@C deliver high round-trip efficiency together with a peak power density of 130 mW cm-2, a specific capacity of 757 mAh g-1, and desirable stability, outperforming the traditional Zn-air batteries based on the Pt/C and RuO2 pair.

The objective was to estimate major bleeding risk and mortality among new users of antiplatelet drugs in real-world clinical practice. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A population-based prospective cohort using the French national health data system (SNIIRAM), identified 69,911 adults living within five well-defined geographical areas, who were new users of antiplatelet drugs in 2013-2015 and who had not received any antithrombotics in 2012. Among them, 63,600 started a monotherapy and 6,311 a dual regimen. Clinical data for all adults referred for bleeding was collected from all emergency departments within these areas, and medically validated. Databases were linked using common key variables. The main outcome measure was time to major bleeding (GI, ICH and other bleedings). Secondary outcomes were death, and event-free survival (EFS). Hazard ratios (HR) were derived from adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. We used Inverse Propensity of Treatment Weighting as a stratified sensitivity analysis according to the antiplatelet monotherapy indication: primary prevention without cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, with CV risk factors, and secondary prevention. We observed 250 (0.36%) major haemorrhages, 81 ICH, 106 GI and 63 other types of bleeding. Incidences were twice as high in dual therapy as in monotherapy. Compared to low-dose aspirin (&#8804; 100 mg daily), high-dose (> 100 up to 325 mg daily) was associated with an increased risk of ICH (HR = 1.80, 95%CI 1.10 to 2.95). EFS was improved by high-dose compared to low-dose aspirin (1.41, 1.04 to 1.90 and 1.32, 1.03 to 1.68) and clopidogrel (1.30, 0.73 to 2.3 and 1.7, 1.24 to 2.34) respectively in primary prevention with and without CV risk factors. CONCLUSION: The incidence of major bleeding and mortality was low. In monotherapy, low-dose aspirin was the safest therapeutic option whatever the indication.

This study aims to investigate the self-reported physical activity (PA) and eating habits related to the consumption of Mediterranean foods in a sample of adolescents during the COVID-19 lockdown enrolled into the DIMENU study. A web survey was launched for 91 adolescents (aged 15–17 years) to assess their adherence to the Mediterranean Diet using the KIDMED test and lifestyle habits using a questionnaire designed following recommendations by Italian National Institute of Health (ISS score). Our results indicate that most of the sample declared no changes in eating habits and PA without sex differences. After dividing the sample into active and sedentary groups based on the self-perceived PA, we found that KIDMED and ISS scores were significantly higher (p = 0.0028 and p = 0.0001, respectively) in active adolescents. Moreover, KIDMED was positively correlated with ISS only in active adolescents (r = 0.311, p = 0.0185). In conclusion, our data underline the impact of the PA on the Mediterranean diet adherence in adolescents during the lockdown, suggesting the usefulness of promoting wellness programs directed towards inactive individuals to increase their awareness on the importance of healthy lifestyles.","Galluccio, Angelo Caparello Giovanna Avolio Ennio Manes Emanuele Ferraro Simona Giordano Cinzia Sisci Diego Bonofiglio Daniela",Healthcare,278,33

The goal of this study was to evaluate the emotional well-being of pharmacy students several months from the COVID19 pandemic in the US. Methods: A retrospective study was designed to evaluate the effect of pandemic on second, third- and fourth-year Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students. Data was obtained from an online survey conducted once in November 2019 and once in November 2020. The survey consisted of the Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms-62 (CCAPS-62) questionnaire. Subscales from CCAPS-62 considered in this study included depression, general anxiety (GA), hostility and substance abuse (SA). Raw scores for each subscale was categorized into healthy and clinical. A logistic regression model, adjusted for gender, race, class and physical activity was used to find any association between the pandemic and the probability of each subscale. Results: Overall, 305 and 159 students participated in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Majority of students were female and Asian. The results of adjusted regression model did not show any significant changes in the probability of depression, GA and SA between 2019 and 2020. However, a decrease in hostility was observed (OR=0.66 95%CI=0.43-o.997) in 2020. Conclusions: Contrary to previous studies, our study did not indicate increases in depression, general anxiety, hostility and substance abuse during the pandemic. The difference can be explained by the difference in the design of studies and the different data analysis. Previous studies were mostly cross-sectional and did not have a chance to evaluate the emotional state of the participants after controlling for other factors.","Zakeri, M.; De, L. C.

However, it remains unclear whether there are any biological factors that predispose Black patients to COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To compare in-hospital morbidity, mortality, and inflammatory marker levels between Black and White hospitalized COVID-19 patients. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-center retrospective cohort study analyzed data for Black and White patients aged &#8805;18 years hospitalized with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test between March 1, 2020, and August 4, 2020. MAIN MEASURES: The exposure was self-identified race documented in the medical record. The primary outcome of was in-hospital death. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit admission, hospital morbidities, and inflammatory marker levels. KEY RESULTS: A total of 1,424 Black and White patients were identified. The mean ± SD age was 56.1 ± 17.4 years, and 663 (44.5%) were female. There were 683 (48.0%) Black and 741 (52.0%) White patients. In the univariate analysis, Black patients had longer hospital stays (8.1 ± 10.2 vs. 6.7 ± 8.3 days, p = 0.011) and tended to have higher rates of in-hospital death (11.0% vs. 7.3%), myocardial infarction (6.9% vs. 4.5%), pulmonary embolism (PE; 5.0% vs. 2.3%), and acute kidney injury (AKI; 39.4% vs. 23.1%) than White patients (p <0.05). However, after adjusting for potential confounders, only PE (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.07, 95% CI, 1.13-3.79) and AKI (aOR 2.16, 95% CI, 1.57-2.97) were statistically significantly associated with Black race. In comparison with White patients, Black patients had statistically significantly higher peak plasma D-dimer (standardized ß = 0.10), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (standardized ß = 0.13), ferritin (standardized ß = 0.09), and lactate dehydrogenase (standardized ß = 0.11), after adjusting for potential confounders (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Black hospitalized COVID-19 patients had increased risks of developing PE and AKI and higher inflammatory marker levels compared with White patients. This observation may be explained by differences in the prevalence and severity of underlying comorbidities and other unmeasured biologic risk factors between Black and White patients. Future research is needed to investigate the mechanism of these observed differences in outcomes of severe COVID-19 infection in Black versus White patients.","Charoenngam, Nipith; Ilori, Titilayo O; Holick, Michael F; Hochberg, Natasha S; Apovian, Caroline M",J. gen. intern. med,278,16

This technique accompanied with nanosatellites technology can improve the routine of wireless communication, almost in areas that suffer networks coverage, which is presented in some areas such as Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Thus, a conception of wireless communication was proposed based on nanosatellites technology around the telemedicine technique for a distance consultation. To overcome the issue of full time coverage for the desired area, a constellation of 7 satellites was designed using simulation tool for satellite constellation design. It provides a near real time transmission, achieving a revisit time equal to 27 min. This method therefore, can develop techniques for remote health care. © 2021 IEEE.","Bahri, O.

They all completed online questionnaires assessing PI, sadness, concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and demographic and work-related variables. All groups but protective services workers showed higher PI levels than the general population. Healthcare and grocery workers were the most affected, with 73.6% and 65.2% of the participants, respectively, showing a severe PI. Women showed a higher PI level. Healthcare workers in the regions with higher COVID-19 incidences reported greater PI levels. The main concerns were being infected by COVID-19 or infecting others. Levels of concern correlated with higher PI levels. The protection equipment was generally reported as insufficient, which correlated with higher PI levels. Professionals reporting to overwork during the crisis (60% mass-media, 38% of healthcare and grocery and 21.7% of protective service) showed higher PI levels. In the healthcare group, taking care of patients with COVID-19 (77%) or of dying patients with COVID-19 (43.9%) was associated with higher PI levels. The perceived social recognition of their work was inversely related to PI. Most of the sample had not received psychological support. We suggest some organizational measures for frontline institutions, such as the periodical monitoring or inclusion of psychologists specialized in crisis-management to prevent negative symptoms and provide timely support.","Rodríguez-Rey, Rocío; Garrido-Hernansaiz, Helena; Bueno-Guerra, Nereida",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),278,1

Referring to the national standard for the ""Surgical Mask"" of China, 17 materials to be selected for homemade masks were tested in four key indicators: pressure difference, particle filtration efficiency, bacterial filtration efficiency and resistance to surface wetting. Eleven single-layer materials met the standard of pressure difference (&#8804;49 Pa), of which 3 met the standard of resistance to surface wetting (&#8805;3), 1 met the standard of particle filtration efficiency (&#8805;30%), but none met the standard of bacterial filtration efficiency (&#8805;95%).

We classified government interventions into three categories and introduced three parameters as descriptions for the key points in disease control, these being intraregional growth rate, interregional communication rate, and detection rate of infectors. Our simulation predicts the infection by COVID-19 in the UK would be out of control in 73 days without any interventions; at the same time, herd immunity acquisition will begin from the epicentre. After we introduced government interventions, a single intervention is effective in disease control but at huge expense, while combined interventions would be more efficient, among which, enhancing detection number is crucial in the control strategy for COVID-19. In addition, we calculated requirements for the most effective vaccination strategy based on infection numbers in a real situation. Our model was programmed with iterative algorithms, and visualized via cellular automata; it can be applied to similar epidemics in other regions if the basic parameters are inputted, and is able to synthetically mimic the effect of multiple factors in infectious disease control.","Zhang, Yuxuan; Gong, Chen; Li, Dawei; Wang, Zhi-Wei; Pu, Shengda D; Robertson, Alex W; Yu, Hong; Parrington, John",Sci Rep,278,20

Children typically have very mild, or no, symptoms of infection. This makes estimations of seroprevalence in children difficult. Research is therefore required to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children. The primary objective of this study is to report the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and/or IgG antibodies in healthy children at baseline, 2 months and 6 months. This is the only longitudinal UK study of seroprevalence in an exclusively paediatric population. Determining the changing seroprevalence is of vital public health importance and can help inform decisions around the lifting of paediatric specific social distancing measures such as school closures and the cancellation of routine paediatric hospital services. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 1000 healthy children of healthcare workers aged between 2 and 15 years will be recruited from five UK sites (Belfast, Cardiff, Glasgow, London and Manchester). The children will undergo phlebotomy at baseline, 2 months and 6 months to measure IgM and/or IgG positivity to SARS-CoV-2. A sample size of 675 patients is required to detect a 5% change in seroprevalence at each time point assuming an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.2. Adjusted probabilities for the presence of IgG and/or IgM antibodies and of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be reported using logistic regression models where appropriate. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the London - Chelsea Research Ethics Committee (REC Reference-20/HRA/1731) and the Belfast Health & Social Care Trust Research Governance (Reference 19147TW-SW).

The aim of the study was to assess whether different Polish HCW utilize face masks according to the 2020 World Health Organization guidance (WHO) criteria. This cross-sectional study included 1156 respondents who participated in an internet survey evaluating mask-related behaviors. All the WHO criteria were complied with by 1.4% of participants, regardless of medical profession, specialty or place of employment. HCW mostly adhered to criterion 1 (C1; strict covering of the face and mouth with the mask; 90.8%), C4 (washing/disinfecting the hands after touching/taking off the mask; 49%) and C3 (taking off the mask properly without touching the anterior surface; 43.4%), whereas C2 (avoidance of touching the mask with hands) was complied with least commonly (6.8%). HCW with mask-induced itch (31.6%) complied to C2 less often (odds ratio 0.53; p = 0.01). The study reveals that Polish HCW rarely adhere to all the 2020 WHO guidance criteria on the use of masks, whereas the adherence to particular criteria is variable and may be associated with the presence of skin-related conditions and other factors. Better compliance with the recommendations in the future is necessary to increase personal safety of HCW and prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Reszke, Radomir; Matusiak, Lukasz; Krajewski, Piotr K; Szepietowska, Marta; Bialynicki-Birula, Rafal; Szepietowski, Jacek C",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),278,24

Additionally, understanding the potential mechanisms of neurologic injury may guide efforts to better detect and ameliorate these complications. In this review, we synthesize a range of clinical observations and initial case series describing potential neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 and place these observations in the context of coronavirus neuro-pathophysiology as it may relate to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Reported nervous system manifestations range from anosmia and ageusia, to cerebral hemorrhage and infarction. While the volume of COVID-19-related case studies continues to grow, previous work examining related viruses suggests potential mechanisms through which the novel coronavirus may impact the CNS and result in neurological complications. Namely, animal studies examining the SARS-CoV have implicated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 receptor as a mediator of coronavirus-related neuronal damage and have shown that SARS-CoV can infect cerebrovascular endothelium and brain parenchyma, the latter predominantly in the medial temporal lobe, resulting in apoptosis and necrosis. Human postmortem brain studies indicate that human coronavirus variants and SARS-CoV can infect neurons and glia, implying SARS-CoV-2 may have similar neurovirulence. Additionally, studies have demonstrated an increase in cytokine serum levels as a result of SARS-CoV infection, consistent with the notion that cytokine overproduction and toxicity may be a relevant potential mechanism of neurologic injury, paralleling a known pathway of pulmonary injury. We also discuss evidence that suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be a vasculotropic and neurotropic virus. Early reports suggest COVID-19 may be associated with severe neurologic complications, and several plausible mechanisms exist to account for these observations. A heightened awareness of the potential for neurologic involvement and further investigation into the relevant pathophysiology will be necessary to understand and ultimately mitigate SARS-CoV-2-associated neurologic injury.","Aghagoli, Ghazal; Gallo Marin, Benjamin; Katchur, Nicole J; Chaves-Sell, Franz; Asaad, Wael F; Murphy, Sarah A",Neurocritical care,278,16

Whereas the addictive potential of online (computer) videogames is well-established, there is yet insufficient evidence for Internet gaming disorder (IGD) in mobile gamers and for the mediating role of some mechanisms involved. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the frustration of psychological needs on mobile videogamers' addictive behavior as well as the role of cognitions (game-use expectancies) and behaviors (time spent playing) through a hypothesized serial mediation model, while controlling for important correlates, such as game genre, age, gender and payment during play.

The results corroborate the negative effects of need frustration on IGD among mobile gamers and clarify the role of time spent playing and game-use expectancies in the development of IGD, highlighting the important role of cognitions in this relationship. We conclude that both the time spent playing and game-use expectancies should be important targets for clinical interventions, even though they are not included in the diagnostic criteria.","Chamarro, Andrés; Oberst, Ursula; Cladellas, Ramón; Fuster, Héctor",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),278,24

ACE2 is a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). SARS-CoV-2 causes ACE/ACE2 balance disruption and RAAS activation, which leads ultimately to COVID-19 progression, especially in patients with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, ACE2 expression may have paradoxical effects, aiding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, yet conversely limiting viral infection.

While some patients infected with the disease-causing virus SARS-CoV2 have no or mild symptoms, others experience severe symptoms requiring hospitalization. Of these more severe patients, some remain stable while others experience cytokine storm syndrome or an exaggerated immune response that has been correlated with disease severity and progression of acute respiratory deterioration. It is currently unknown why some patients with COVID-19 demonstrate this response and others do not. In light of the apparent prominent role of the inflammatory mediators (i.e. cytokines) in COVID-19 pathogenesis, the ability to identify screening tools not only for the SARS-CoV2 virus but also for cytokines is important. The present investigation was designed to identify the urinary cytokine signature in COVID-19 patients. Methods The study enrolled 17 COVID-19 patients and 10 control subjects (SARS-CoV-2 negative) 18 years or older with glomerular filtration rate of &gt; 60mL/min. Urine samples were collected and cytokines quantitated using the Luminex multiplex assay. The cytokines analyzed were growth-regulated oncogene (GRO), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Results The levels of GRO and IL-6 were significantly elevated in urine samples obtained from COVID-19 patients compared to controls (mean 16.8 pg/ml vs. 9.2 pg/ml ± 2.39, p &lt; 0.0171 and mean 16.8 pg/ml vs 9.2 pg/ml ± 2.42, p &lt; 0.0157, respectively). Conversely, IL-8 level was similar between COVID-19 patients and controls (15.6 pg/ml vs 11.3 pg/ml ± 1.3, p&lt;0.1833). Conclusion The present investigation found that the levels of urinary cytokines GRO and IL-6 were significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients compared to controls and may serve as urinary biomarkers of disease progression. Furthermore, IL-8 although elevated in COVID-19 patients, did not reach statistical significance in our population sample. The findings of this proof of concept study underscore that the urinary cytokines may serve as prognostic and diagnostic accessible biomarkers in COVID-19.","Komnenov, Dragana Dhar Nivedita Lamb Laura Wills Melissa Khaliq Fareea Timar Ryan Chancellor Michael Bartolone Sarah Ward Elijah Rossi Noreen Bitar Ali Dhar Sorabh Cohn Johnathan",The FASEB Journal,278,16

This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number and severity of cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Japan. METHODS: Using claims data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database, urgent cases of inpatients for CAP from 01 August 2018 to 30 July 2020 were included. The monthly ratios of inpatient cases were compared from August 2018 to July 2019 and August 2019 to July 2020 as a year-over-year comparison. These ratios were also compared according to the ""A-DROP"" severity score, and an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the monthly number of inpatient cases. RESULTS: This study included a total of 67,900 inpatient cases for CAP in 262 hospitals. During the COVID-19 pandemic (defined as the period between March and July 2020) the number of inpatient cases for CAP drastically decreased compared with the same period in the previous year (-48.1%), despite a temporary reduction in the number of other urgent admissions. The number of inpatient cases decreased according to the severity of pneumonia. Milder cases showed a greater decrease in the year-over-year ratio than severe ones: mild -55.2%, moderate -45.8%, severe -39.4%, and extremely severe -33.2%. The ITS analysis showed that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the monthly number of inpatient cases for CAP (estimated decrease: -1233 cases; 95% CI -521 to -1955). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a significant reduction in the number of inpatient cases for CAP during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The milder cases showed a greater decrease in the year-over-year ratio of the number of inpatient cases.","Nagano, Hiroyuki; Takada, Daisuke; Shin, Jung-Ho; Morishita, Tetsuji; Kunisawa, Susumu; Imanaka, Yuichi",Int J Infect Dis,278,1

METHODS: Data interpretation was conducted by recruiting bioinformatics analysis, including Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways analysis using downloaded data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database. RESULTS: The present study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the upregulation of 14 interferon-stimulated genes, indicative of immune, and interferon responses to the virus. Notably, genes for pyrimidine metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis are selectively enriched in human lung cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that altered pyrimidine metabolism and steroid biosynthesis are remarkable, and perhaps druggable features after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Besides, there is a strong positive correlation between viral ORF1ab, ORF6, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression in human lung cells, implying that ACE2 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in host cells probably through the induction of ORF1ab and ORF6.","Yang, Shaomin; Wu, Songbin; Yu, Zhijian; Huang, Jiabin; Zhong, Xia; Liu, Xiaodong; Zhu, Hua; Xiao, Lizu; Deng, Qiwen; Sun, Wuping",Immun Inflamm Dis,278,16

Objective: To determine whether the combination of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine attenuates organ injury in patients with septic shock. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, blinded, multicenter clinical trial of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine vs placebo for adult patients with septic shock. Two hundred five patients were enrolled between February 9, 2018, and October 27, 2019, at 14 centers in the United States. Follow-up continued until November 26, 2019. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive parenteral ascorbic acid (1500 mg), hydrocortisone (50 mg), and thiamine (100 mg) every 6 hours for 4 days (n = 103) or placebo in matching volumes at the same time points (n = 102). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range, 0-24; 0 = best) between enrollment and 72 hours. Key secondary outcomes included kidney failure and 30-day mortality. Patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug were included in analyses. Results: Among 205 randomized patients (mean age, 68 [SD, 15] years; 90 [44%] women), 200 (98%) received at least 1 dose of study drug, completed the trial, and were included in the analyses (101 with intervention and 99 with placebo group). Overall, there was no statistically significant interaction between time and treatment group with regard to SOFA score over the 72 hours after enrollment (mean SOFA score change from 9.1 to 4.4 [-4.7] points with intervention vs 9.2 to 5.1 [-4.1] points with placebo; adjusted mean difference, -0.8; 95% CI, -1.7 to 0.2; P = .12 for interaction). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of kidney failure (31.7% with intervention vs 27.3% with placebo; adjusted risk difference, 0.03; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.2; P = .58) or in 30-day mortality (34.7% vs 29.3%, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8-2.2; P = .26). The most common serious adverse events were hyperglycemia (12 patients with intervention and 7 patients with placebo), hypernatremia (11 and 7 patients, respectively), and new hospital-acquired infection (13 and 12 patients, respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with septic shock, the combination of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine, compared with placebo, did not result in a statistically significant reduction in SOFA score during the first 72 hours after enrollment. These data do not support routine use of this combination therapy for patients with septic shock.

Whether mixing of viral components during co-infection alters pathogenic outcomes or viral replication is not known. In this study, we investigated how different coronavirus nucleocapsid (CoV N) proteins interact and affect PEDV replication. We found that PDCoV N and TGEV N can competitively interact with PEDV N. However, the presence of PDCoV or TGEV N led to very different outcomes on PEDV replication. While PDCoV N significantly suppresses PEDV replication, overexpression of TGEV N, like that of PEDV N, increases production of PEDV RNA and virions. Despite partial interchangeability in nucleocapsid oligomerization and viral RNA synthesis, endogenous PEDV N cannot be replaced in the production of infectious PEDV particles. Results from this study give insights into functional compatibilities and evolutionary relationship between CoV viral proteins during viral co-infection and co-evolution.","Sungsuwan, Suttipun; Jongkaewwattana, Anan; Jaru-Ampornpan, Peera",Virology,278,17

Yes,14.375187,12.2269535,2020,"Neurological disorders caused by neuroviral infections are an obvious pathogenic manifestation. However, non-neurotropic viruses or peripheral viral infections pose a considerable challenge as their neuropathological manifestations do not emerge because of primary infection. Their secondary or bystander pathologies develop much later, like a syndrome, during and after the recovery of patients from the primary disease. Massive inflammation caused by peripheral viral infections can trigger multiple neurological anomalies. These neurological damages may range from a general cognitive and motor dysfunction up to a wide spectrum of CNS anomalies, such as Acute Necrotizing Hemorrhagic Encephalopathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Encephalitis, Meningitis, anxiety, and other audio-visual disabilities. Peripheral viruses like Measles virus, Enteroviruses, Influenza viruses (HIN1 series), SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and, recently, SARS-CoV-2 are reported to cause various neurological manifestations in patients and are proven to be neuropathogenic even in cellular and animal model systems. This review presents a comprehensive picture of CNS susceptibilities toward these peripheral viral infections and explains some common underlying themes of their neuropathology in the human brain.","Mishra, Ritu; Banerjea, Akhil C",Front Immunol,278,16

However, cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases, encompassing a spectrum of tumour subtypes. The aim of this study was to investigate COVID-19 risk according to tumour subtype and patient demographics in patients with cancer in the UK. METHODS: We compared adult patients with cancer enrolled in the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP) cohort between March 18 and May 8, 2020, with a parallel non-COVID-19 UK cancer control population from the UK Office for National Statistics (2017 data). The primary outcome of the study was the effect of primary tumour subtype, age, and sex and on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) prevalence and the case-fatality rate during hospital admission. We analysed the effect of tumour subtype and patient demographics (age and sex) on prevalence and mortality from COVID-19 using univariable and multivariable models. FINDINGS: 319 (30·6%) of 1044 patients in the UKCCMP cohort died, 295 (92·5%) of whom had a cause of death recorded as due to COVID-19. The all-cause case-fatality rate in patients with cancer after SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly associated with increasing age, rising from 0·10 in patients aged 40-49 years to 0·48 in those aged 80 years and older. Patients with haematological malignancies (leukaemia, lymphoma, and myeloma) had a more severe COVID-19 trajectory compared with patients with solid organ tumours (odds ratio [OR] 1·57, 95% CI 1·15-2·15; p<0·0043). Compared with the rest of the UKCCMP cohort, patients with leukaemia showed a significantly increased case-fatality rate (2·25, 1·13-4·57; p=0·023). After correction for age and sex, patients with haematological malignancies who had recent chemotherapy had an increased risk of death during COVID-19-associated hospital admission (OR 2·09, 95% CI 1·09-4·08; p=0·028). INTERPRETATION: Patients with cancer with different tumour types have differing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 phenotypes. We generated individualised risk tables for patients with cancer, considering age, sex, and tumour subtype. Our results could be useful to assist physicians in informed risk-benefit discussions to explain COVID-19 risk and enable an evidenced-based approach to national social isolation policies.

How to effectively control such epidemic has gradually become a global issue. This paper reviews the economic impact of major epidemics such as SARS, H1N1, and Ebola at the micro-, sector-, and macro-level. The challenge of effective epidemic control is to achieve a balance between viral transmission reduction and economic cost. This paper then summarizes three main methods to evaluate the effectiveness of several control policies. We also find that the adequacy and authenticity of information disclosure is of great importance to minimize economic loss, as either public panic due to overestimation or lack of public awareness due to underestimation can cause additional negative economic impacts. Accurate and transparent disclosure of information plays a crucial role associated with fighting against the epidemic. Finally, the paper puts forward a number of policy recommendations to minimize economic loss while controlling the spread of COVID-19.","Gong, Binlei; Zhang, Shurui; Yuan, Lingran; Chen, Kevin Z.",J.

Our aim was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on animal behaviour and welfare researchers' work experience and productivity, focussing on gender, care role, career stage and teaching load. An online survey asked researchers about childcare, research and teaching load and associated changes due to the pandemic, among others, and included the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Inventory of Socially Supportive Behaviours (ISSB). From June-July 2020, 117 completed responses were received from 28 countries. Time available for writing papers and grants either increased (36%), decreased (31%) or these tasks were halted completely (12%). Perceived productivity was significantly lower for caregivers (P < 0.001) and for men as compared to women (P < 0.001); and low productivity was associated with more stress (higher PSS: P < 0.001). Respondents' experience of the pandemic related to the PSS (b = -0.03 ± 0.02; P = 0.03) and to self-assessed personality traits (P = 0.01). The average PSS of 21 ± 6.5 was greater than the reference value of 15, and was higher when respondents had low job security (P < 0.001) and when they more strongly characterised themselves as perfectionists, hard-working, empathetic and worried (P = 0.02). Respondents who had an intense care role received most social support (P = 0.04). Teaching load increased for 25% of the respondents but did not significantly relate to any of the response variables. Overall, caregivers and early career researchers faced the most difficulties, and personality traits had a major impact on the ability to cope with the changes caused by the pandemic.","Camerlink, Irene; Nielsen, Birte L; Windschnurer, Ines; Vigors, Belinda",Appl Anim Behav Sci,278,29

Among these changes, asplenism or hyposplenism has been reported in patients with celiac disease. It has been reported that the risk of pneumococcal sepsis is higher in celiac patients with hyposplenism. Moreover, celiac patients present high risk of admission to hospital due to influenza. OBJECTIVE: To determine the degree of awareness of COVID-19 among parents of children with celiac disease and examine the measures that they take. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study at a university hospital in the Middle Anatolian region of Turkey. METHODS: The diagnosis of celiac disease was confirmed through a survey conducted online among 73 parents between May and July 2020. RESULTS: The mean age was 37.57 ± 6.56 years for the mothers, 41.15 ± 5.56 years for the fathers and 11.36 ± 4.36 years for the children. 90.4% of the parents reported that COVID-19 was transmitted through ""speaking, coughing, sneezing and infection of the face after contact with virus-infected surfaces"". Moreover, 78.1% indicated that they did not have any difficulty in finding gluten-free foods. CONCLUSION: These parents of children with celiac disease believed that their children's risk of developing COVID-19 did not differ from that of healthy children. It was also observed that appetite and states of nervousness were higher among these children with celiac disease during lockdowns and that their sleep patterns were affected.","Bükülmez, Ayamp; 351,; egül,; Baamp,; Taamp, Melike; delen,; Çiftci, Esra",Säo Paulo med. j,278,33

Applying construal level theory and regulatory focus theory, this research investigates how the interplay of construal mindsets and message frames affects consumers’ purchase intention regarding online food deliveries during the pandemic. Two 2 × 2 experiments were conducted in severe and mild pandemic regions and revealed different results in consumers’ responses. Specifically, promotion-framed messages are more effective when matching a “how” construal mindset in severe regions. In contrast, promotion-framed messages are more persuasive in conjecture with a “why” construal mindset in mild pandemic areas. Besides, the persuasion process is mediated through self-efficacy in severe regions but through perceived benefit in mild regions. The study also reveals different moderating effects of risk propensity in the two regions. The findings provide guidelines for ODPs in engaging consumers with online food delivery services.","Cai, Ruiying; Leung, Xi Y.",Int. J. Hosp. Manage.,278,28

According to current available data, the cytokine storm appears to be the most life-threatening symptom of severe COVID-19 cases accompanied with lung fibrosis. Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a member of soluble beta-galactoside-binding lectin families, has been implicated as a key regulator in various inflammation conditions in addition to its well-documented roles in cancer. The pro-inflammatory activity of Gal-3 in the inflammatory response and lung fibrosis of COVID-19 has been proposed by emerging studies, which suggested that inhibition of Gal-3 may represent a novel treatment approach for COVID-19 patients. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis. ICC accounts for 10-25% of primary liver cancers with limited therapeutic options, which has higher incidence in Asian countries, particularly in China. Cancer patients, including ICC patients, are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to their impaired immune system. It is thus undoubtedly a challenge for our oncology department to establish effective treatment strategies under the influence of the COVID-19 crisis. According to our management procedures in the COVID-19 era, emergency treatment will be applied to ICC patients who are under life-threatening conditions, despite the COVID-19 infection. To the best of our knowledge, the modulatory function of Gal-3 in ICC is still barely explored to date. In order to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Gal-3 for ICC patients or those comprised with COVID-19, we herein report our preliminary investigation into roles of Gal-3 in ICC. Our results exhibited that the expression of Gal-3 was significantly up-regulated in ICC tissues, and a significant correlation was observed between its overexpression and malignant progression of ICC cells. We further discussed the activity and possible molecular mechanisms of Gal-3 in ICC, which may pave the ways for further exploring the possibility of Gal-3 as a potential therapeutic target for treating ICC patients or those with COVID-19-related conditions.","Li, H.; Li, J.; Xiao, W.; Zhang, Y.; Lv, Y.; Yu, X.; Zheng, J.",Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences,278,24

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the newly evolving human coronavirus infection that causes COVID-19, and it first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly all over the world. COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies. There is currently no established consensus on the standard of care in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, certain medications suggested for other diseases have been shown to be potentially effective for treating this infection, though there has yet to be clear evidence. Therapies include new agents that are currently tested in several clinical trials, in addition to other medications that have been repurposed as antiviral and immune-modulating therapies. Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, advances in molecular biology techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest potential therapies. This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic. All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use.","Saber-Ayad, Maha; Saleh, Mohamed A; Abu-Gharbieh, Eman",Pharmaceuticals,278,18

In healthy neurons, full-length PINK1 (fPINK1) is post-translationally cleaved into different lower molecular weight forms, and cleaved PINK1 (cPINK1) gets shuttled to the cytosolic compartments to support extra-mitochondrial functions. While numerous studies have exemplified the role of mitochondrially localized PINK1 in modulating mitophagy in oxidatively stressed neurons, little is known regarding the physiological role of cPINK1 in healthy neurons. We have previously shown that cPINK1, but not fPINK1, modulates the neurite outgrowth and the maintenance of dendritic arbors by activating downstream protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in healthy neurons. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cPINK1 promotes neurite outgrowth remain to be elucidated. In this report, we show that cPINK1 supports neuronal development by modulating the expression and extracellular release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Consistent with this role, we observed a progressive increase in the level of endogenous cPINK1 but not fPINK1 during prenatal and postnatal development of mouse brains and during development in primary cortical neurons. In cultured primary neurons, the pharmacological activation of endogenous PINK1 leads to enhanced downstream PKA activity, subsequent activation of the PKA-modulated transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), increased intracellular production and extracellular release of BDNF, and enhanced activation of the BDNF receptor-TRKß. Mechanistically, cPINK1-mediated increased dendrite complexity requires the binding of extracellular BDNF to TRKß. In summary, our data support a physiological role of cPINK1 in stimulating neuronal development by activating the PKA-CREB-BDNF signaling axis in a feedforward loop.","Soman, Smijin K; Tingle, David; Dagda, Raul Y; Torres, Mariana; Dagda, Marisela; Dagda, Ruben K",J. neurosci. res,278,16

METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we examined the proportion and probability of self-reported systemic and local side-effects within 8 days of vaccination in individuals using the COVID Symptom Study app who received one or two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine or one dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. We also compared infection rates in a subset of vaccinated individuals subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2 with PCR or lateral flow tests with infection rates in unvaccinated controls. All analyses were adjusted by age (&#8804;55 years vs >55 years), sex, health-care worker status (binary variable), obesity (BMI <30 kg/m2vs &#8805;30 kg/m2), and comorbidities (binary variable, with or without comorbidities). FINDINGS: Between Dec 8, and March 10, 2021, 627 383 individuals reported being vaccinated with 655 590 doses: 282 103 received one dose of BNT162b2, of whom 28 207 received a second dose, and 345 280 received one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Systemic side-effects were reported by 13·5% (38 155 of 282 103) of individuals after the first dose of BNT162b2, by 22·0% (6216 of 28 207) after the second dose of BNT162b2, and by 33·7% (116 473 of 345 280) after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Local side-effects were reported by 71·9% (150 023 of 208 767) of individuals after the first dose of BNT162b2, by 68·5% (9025 of 13 179) after the second dose of BNT162b2, and by 58·7% (104 282 of 177 655) after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Systemic side-effects were more common (1·6 times after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 2·9 times after the first dose of BNT162b2) among individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection than among those without known past infection. Local effects were similarly higher in individuals previously infected than in those without known past infection (1·4 times after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 1·2 times after the first dose of BNT162b2). 3106 of 103 622 vaccinated individuals and 50 340 of 464 356 unvaccinated controls tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Significant reductions in infection risk were seen starting at 12 days after the first dose, reaching 60% (95% CI 49-68) for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 69% (66-72) for BNT162b2 at 21-44 days and 72% (63-79) for BNT162b2 after 45-59 days.

Systemic side-effects were more common (1·6 times after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 2·9 times after the first dose of BNT162b2) among individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection than among those without known past infection. Local effects were similarly higher in individuals previously infected than in those without known past infection (1·4 times after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 1·2 times after the first dose of BNT162b2). 3106 of 103 622 vaccinated individuals and 50 340 of 464 356 unvaccinated controls tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Significant reductions in infection risk were seen starting at 12 days after the first dose, reaching 60% (95% CI 49-68) for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 69% (66-72) for BNT162b2 at 21-44 days and 72% (63-79) for BNT162b2 after 45-59 days. INTERPRETATION: Systemic and local side-effects after BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination occur at frequencies lower than reported in phase 3 trials. Both vaccines decrease the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection after 12 days.

It is also associated with atypical presentation of the disease. Despite the possible contribution of malnutrition to the acquisition and severity of COVID-19, it is not clear which nutritional screening measures may best diagnose malnutrition in these patients at early stages. This is of crucial importance given the urgency and rapid progression of the disease in vulnerable groups. Accordingly, this review examines the available literature for different nutritional screening approaches implemented among COVID-19 patients, with a special focus on elderly adults. After a literature search, we selected and scrutinized 14 studies assessing malnutrition among COVID-19 patients. The Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) has demonstrated superior sensitivity to other traditional screening measures. The controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, which comprises serum albumin level, cholesterol level, and lymphocytes count, as well as a combined CONUT-lactate dehydrogenase-C-reactive protein score expressed a predictive capacity even superior to that of NRS-2002 (0.81% and 0.92% vs. 0.79%) in midlife and elder COVID-19 patients. Therefore, simple measures based on routinely conducted laboratory investigations such as the CONUT score may be timely, cheap, and valuable alternatives for identifying COVID-19 patients with high nutritional risk. Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) was the only measure used to detect residual malnutrition and high malnutrition risk in remitting patients-MNA scores correlated with hypoalbuminemia, hypercytokinemia, and weight loss. Older males with severe inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, and pre-existing comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, or hypertension) are more prone to malnutrition and subsequently poor COVID-19 prognosis both during the acute phase and during convalescence. Thus, they are in need of frequent nutritional monitoring and support while detecting and treating malnutrition in the general public might be necessary to increase resilience against COVID-19.","Ali, Amira Mohammed; Kunugi, Hiroshi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),278,0

This study aims to test the hypothesis that magnesium (Mg) treatment leads to DNA methylation changes in TMPRSS2. METHODS: This study is nested within the Personalized Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Trial, a double-blind 2 × 2 factorial randomized controlled trial, which enrolled 250 participants from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. RESULTS: We found that 12 wk of personalized Mg treatment significantly increased 5-methylcytosine methylation at cg16371860 (TSS1500, promoter) by 7.2% compared to the placebo arm (decreased by 0.1%) in those ages < 65 y. The difference remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex, and baseline methylation as well as correction for false discovery rate (adjusted P = 0.014). Additionally, Mg treatment significantly reduced 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels at cg26337277 (close proximity to TSS200 and the 5' untranslated region, promoter) by 2.3% compared to an increase of 7.1% in the placebo arm after adjusting for covariates in those ages < 65 y (P = 0.003). The effect remained significant at a false discovery rate of 0.10 (adjusted P = 0.088). CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals ages < 65 y with calcium-to-magnesium intake ratios equal to or over 2.6, reducing the ratio to around 2.3 increased 5-methylcytosine modifications (i.e., cg16371860) and reduced 5-hydroxymethylcytosine modifications (i.e., cg26337277) in the TMPRSS2 gene. These findings, if confirmed, provide another mechanism for the role of Mg intervention in the prevention of COVID-19 and treatment of early and mild disease by modifying the phenotype of the TMPRSS2 genotype.","Fan, Lei; Zhu, Xiangzhu; Zheng, Yinan; Zhang, Wei; Seidner, Douglas L; Ness, Reid; Murff, Harvey J; Yu, Chang; Huang, Xiang; Shrubsole, Martha J; Hou, Lifang; Dai, Qi",Nutrition,278,25

Thus far, the literature has not detailed the experience of stress testing in this patient population. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients that recovered from COVID-19-related hospitalizations and underwent SPECT MPI studies at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Medical Center. RESULTS: 15 patients (median age 60 years, 67% male) were identified with COVID-19-related hospitalization and then underwent SPECT MPI imaging after recovery. During COVID-19-related hospitalization (median length of stay 8 days), patients received various COVID-19 therapies; 3 required mechanical ventilation. Stress tests (4 Exercise, 11 Pharmacologic) were performed 65 days (interquartile range 31-94 days) after the diagnosis of COVID-19. None of the patients experienced serious adverse events during or after stress testing. One patient required regadenoson reversal using aminophylline due to chest pain. CONCLUSION: Over time, more patients that recover from COVID-19 infection will require MPI testing for myocardial ischemia evaluation. Our study provides some information regarding performing stress testing in patients who have recently recovered from COVID-19 infections requiring hospitalization.

The evaluation took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, which allowed us to monitor the effects of the spring 2020 lockdown in the Netherlands on substance trade via Telegram. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether changes in psychoactive substance trade on Telegram markets in the Netherlands can be observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Between December 2, 2019, and June 29, 2020, a total of 70,226 posts appeared in two analyzed Telegram groups. A total of 5,643 posts were psychoactive substance related. Based on the analyzed posts, Telegram is mostly a '""sellers"" market as only a minority of the posts (6.3%) could be identified as a request for a substance. The proportion of posts related to specific substances varied between the periods before, during, and after the lockdown. The proportion of posts on the stimulants ecstasy, cocaine, and amphetamine was lower during the lockdown than before and after. For psychedelics - ketamine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine (2C-B) - and other substances, there was a relative increase in the number of posts during the lockdown, which was maintained after the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Telegram analysis shows that in the Netherlands, online psychoactive substance trade may have been affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. The direction of this effect was different for different classes of substances.","Blankers, Matthijs; van der Gouwe, Daan; Stegemann, Lavinia; Smit-Rigter, Laura",Eur Addict Res,278,9

We start by briefly reviewing the most basic properties of the classic Kermack-McKendrick models and then proceed to look at some generalizations and their applications to contact structures, cocirculation of viral infections, growth patterns of epidemic curves, characterization of probability distributions and passage times necessary to parametrize the compartments that are added to the basic Kermack-McKendrick model. All of these examples revolve around the idea that a system of differential equations constructed for an specifc epidemiological problem, has as central and main theoretical and conceptual support the epidemiological, medical and biological context that motivates its construction and analysis. Fitting differential models to data without a sound perspective on the biological feasibility of the mathematical model will provide an statistical significant fit but will also fall short of providing useful information for the management, mitigation and eventual control of the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2.","Velasco-Hernandez, Jorge X.",,278,1

By adopting a fictional ontological standpoint, the virus' deploying media-storyworld is identified with a process of narrative spacing. Subsequently, the brand's personality is analyzed as a narrative place brand. The advanced narrative model aims to outline the main episodes that make up the virus' brand personality as process and structural components (actors, settings, actions, and relationships). A series of deep or ontological metaphors are identified as the core DNA of this place brand by applying metaphorical modeling to the tropic articulation of Covid-19's narrative. The virus is fundamentally identified with terror as a menacing force that wipes out existing regimes of signification due to its uncertain motives, origins, and operational mode. In this context, familiar urban spaces, cultural practices, and intersubjective communications are redefined, repurposed, and reprogrammed. This process is called terrorealization, as the desertification and metaphorical sublation of all prior territorial significations. This study contributes to the narrative sub-stream of place branding by approaching a globally relevant socio-cultural phenomenon from a brand storytelling perspective.","Rossolatos, George",J.

The lack of vaccines and antivirals prevents clinical strategies against the disease, creating an emerging need for the development of safe and effective treatments. Strategies for vaccine development include complete vaccines against viruses, subunits, and nucleic acids, but are still in their early stages. Studies carried out to date on possible SARS-CoV2 drug targets highlight glycoprotein S, Mpro (main protease or protease type 3C), and a member of the transmembrane serine protease II families (TMPRSS2). However, due to the pandemic state, priority is given to marketed drugs. These include chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), nitazoxanide, remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV / r), in addition to treatment with convalescent plasma. But, therapeutic specific effects against SARS-CoV2 have not yet been verified. Most of the information obtained about treatment is based on preliminary and limited studies. We conclude that, at this time of emergency, the search for new therapies is more urgent due to the need to save lives. Thus, we point out as interesting targets for future more specific research: glycoprotein S, Mpro, and TMPRSS2.","Campos, D M O; Oliveira, C B S; Andrade, J M A; Oliveira, J I N",Braz. j. biol,278,18

Prior to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, NYC H+H served over one million patients, including the most vulnerable New Yorkers, and billed fewer than 500 telehealth visits monthly. Once the pandemic struck, we established a strategy to allow us to continue to serve existing patients and treat the surge of new patients. Starting in March 2020 we were able to transform the system using virtual care platforms through which we conducted almost 83,000 billable televisits in one month and more than 30,000 behavioral health encounters via telephone and video. Telehealth also enabled us to support patient-family communication, post-discharge follow-up, and palliative care for COVID-19 patients. Expanded Medicaid coverage and insurance reimbursement for telehealth played a pivotal role in this transformation. As we move to a new blend of virtual and in-person care, it is vital that the major regulatory and insurance changes undergirding our COVID-19 telehealth response be sustained to protect access for our most vulnerable patients.

The infrastructure of almost all hospitals is currently redirected to provide a maximum of intensive care resources, including the necessary staff. In parallel, routine as well as emergency clinical care for all patients in need has to be secured. This challenge becomes particularly evident in cancer care. In order to maintain adequate oncological care at all levels of provision and to conduct especially curative and intensive treatments with a maximum of safety, continuous adaption of the oncology care system has to be ensured. Intensive communication with colleagues and patients is needed as is consequent expert networking and continuous reflection of the own developed strategies. In parallel, it is of high importance to actively avoid cessation of innovation in order not to endanger the continuous improvement in prognosis of cancer patients. This includes sustained conduction of clinical trials as well as ongoing translational research. Here, we describe measures taken at the University Cancer Center Hamburg (UCCH) - a recognized comprehensive oncology center of excellence - during the COVID-19 crisis. We aim to provide support and potential perspectives to generate a discussion basis on how to maintain high-end cancer care during such a crisis and how to conduct patients safely into the future.","Weisel, Katja C; Morgner-Miehlke, Andrea; Petersen, Cordula; Fiedler, Walter; Block, Andreas; Schafhausen, Philippe; Knobloch, Johannes K; Bokemeyer, Carsten",Oncol Res Treat,278,16

No reliable data on the sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are available because of the lack of a shared reference standard to identify SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The aim of our study was to collect data on patients with a known diagnosis of COVID-19 who underwent serial testing to assess NPS sensitivity. Methods: The study was a multi-center, observational, retrospective clinical study with consecutive enrollment. We enrolled patients who met all of the following inclusion criteria: clinical recovery, documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (&#8805;1 positive rRT-PCR result) and &#8805;1 positive NPS among the first two follow-up swabs. A positive NPS not preceded by a negative nasopharyngeal swab collected 24-48 h earlier was considered a true positive. A negative NPS followed by a positive NPS collected 24-48 h later was regarded as a false negative. The primary outcome was to define sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection with NPS. Results: Three hundred and ninety three NPS were evaluated in 233 patients; the sensitivity was 77% (95% CI, 73 to 81%). Sensitivity of the first follow-up NPS (n = 233) was 79% (95% CI, 73 to 84%) with no significant variations over time. We found no statistically significant differences in the sensitivity of the first follow-up NPS according to time since symptom onset, age, sex, number of comorbidities, and onset symptoms. Conclusions: NPS utility in the diagnostic algorithm of COVID-19 should be reconsidered.","Clerici, Bianca; Muscatello, Antonio; Bai, Francesca; Pavanello, Donatella; Orlandi, Michela; Marchetti, Giulia C; Castelli, Valeria; Casazza, Giovanni; Costantino, Giorgio; Podda, Gian Marco",Front Public Health,278,14

In this regard, this study explores the significant role of trust transfer (from offline to online) and the moderating effect of consumers' neurotic traits in the framework of trust-satisfaction-repurchase intention in the e-commerce context based on a survey with 406 Korean e-commerce consumers. Moreover, a prediction-oriented segmentation (POS) technique combined with structural equation models (SEM) was utilized to reveal consumers' probable hidden heterogeneous characteristics. The outcomes of the global model SEM analysis indicate that offline-online trust transference occurs in e-commerce, and the conveyed trust significantly influences satisfaction and consumers' repeat purchase intention through satisfaction. Neuroticism also has significant positive effects on trust transfer in the global model. However, results in three subgroups generated by POS show heterogeneous characteristics that considerably differed from the global model test results. The implications from this study will be beneficial to field practitioners in the e-commerce industry in addressing the importance of trust transfer, negative neurotic traits as well as heterogeneous aspects of consumers.","Jeon, H.

Recent statistics indicates that about half of the western population, sensitive to this discussion, would be in favor of animal testing while the other half would oppose it. Here, outlining scientific, historical, ethical, and philosophical aspects, we provide an integrated view explaining the reasons why biomedical research can hardly abandon laboratory animal testing. In this paper, we retrace the historical moments that mark the relationship between humans and other animal species. Then starting from Darwin's position on animal experimentation, we outline the steps that over time allowed the introduction of laws and rules that regulate animals' use in biomedical research. In our analysis, we present the perspectives of various authors, with the aim of delineating a theoretical framework within which to insert the ethical debate on laboratory animals research. Through the analysis of fundamental philosophical concepts and some practical examples, we propose a view according to which laboratory animals experimentation become ethically acceptable as far as it is guided by the goal of improving humans and other animal species (i.e., pets) life. Among the elements analyzed, there is the concept of responsibility that only active moral subjects (humans) have towards themselves and towards passive moral subjects (other animal species). We delineate the principle of cruelty that is useful to understand why research in laboratory animals should not be assimilated to a cruel act. Moreover, we touch upon the concepts of necessity and ""good cause"" to underline that, if biomedical research would have the possibility to avoid using animals, it would surely do that. To provide an example of the negative consequences occurring from not allowing laboratory animal research, we analyze the recent experience of Covid-19 epidemic. Finally, recalling the principle of ""heuristics and biases"" by Kahneman, we discuss why scientists should reconsider the way they are conveying information about their research to the general public.","Petetta, Francesca; Ciccocioppo, Roberto",Addict Biol,278,21

OBJECTIVE: To assess the risks of COVID-19 and COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality in patients with BP and pemphigus and to delineate determinants of severe COVID-19 illness among these patients. METHODS: A population-based cohort study compared COVID-19 and its complications in patients with BP (n = 1845) and pemphigus (n = 1236) with age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched control subjects. RESULTS: The risks of COVID-19 (hazard rate [HR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-1.73; P = .691) and COVID-19-associated hospitalization (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.84-2.98; P = .160) was comparable between patients with BP and controls. The risk of COVID-19-associated mortality was higher among patients with BP (HR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.15-6.92; P = .023). The risk of COVID-19 (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.44-1.49; P = .496), COVID-19-associated hospitalization (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.53-3.76; P = .499), and COVID-19-associated mortality (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.15-11.92; P = .789) was similar in patients with pemphigus and their controls. Systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants did not predispose COVID-19-positive BP and pemphigus patients to a more severe illness. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective data collection. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BP experience increased COVID-19-associated mortality and should be monitored closely.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale were used to evaluate the resilience and perceived stress of 600 medical staff members from the radiology departments in 32 public hospitals in Sichuan Province, China, respectively. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze factors related to resilience. RESULTS The total resilience score was 65.76±17.26, wherein the toughness dimension score was 33.61±9.52, the strength dimension score was 21.25±5.50, and the optimism dimension score was 10.91±3.15. There was a significant negative correlation between perceived stress and resilience (r=-0.635, P<0.001). According to multivariate analysis, the total perceived stress score (ß=-1.318, P<0.001), gender (ß=-4.738, P<0.001), knowledge of COVID-19 (ß=2.884, P=0.043), knowledge of COVID-19 protective measures (ß=3.260, P=0.042), and availability of adequate protective materials (ß=-1.268, P=0.039) were independent influencing factors for resilience. CONCLUSIONS The resilience level of the medical staff in the radiology departments during the outbreak of COVID-19 was generally low, particularly regarding toughness. More attention should be paid to resilience influence factors such as high perceived stress, female gender, lack of understanding of COVID-19 and protective measures, and lack of protective materials, and targeted interventions should be undertaken to improve the resilience level of the medical staff in the radiology departments during the outbreak of COVID-19.","Huang, Lei; Wang, Yun; Liu, Juan; Ye, Pengfei; Cheng, Bochao; Xu, Huayan; Qu, Haibo; Ning, Gang",Med Sci Monit,278,20

During the exit step, the virus hijacks the sophisticated machineries that host cells employ to correctly fold, assemble, and transport proteins along the exocytic pathway. Therefore, secretory pathway-mediated assemblage and excretion of infective particles represent appealing targets to reduce the efficacy of virus biogenesis, if not to block it completely. Here, we analyze and discuss the contribution of the molecular machines operating in the early secretory pathway in the biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and their relevance for potential antiviral targeting. The fact that these molecular machines are conserved throughout evolution, together with the redundancy and tissue specificity of their components, provides opportunities in the search for unique proteins essential for SARS-CoV-2 biology that could also be targeted with therapeutic objectives. Finally, we provide an overview of recent evidence implicating proteins of the early secretory pathway as potential antiviral targets with effective therapeutic applications.","Sicari, Daria; Chatziioannou, Aristotelis; Koutsandreas, Theodoros; Sitia, Roberto; Chevet, Eric",J. cell. biol,278,16

In office, their effects can be destructive, primarily because they subordinate health to their other goals. Brazil, the US and the UK all show this pattern.

An effective, reusable, locally-manufactured respirator can mitigate this problem. We describe the development, manufacture, and preliminary testing of an open-hardware-licensed device, the ""simple silicone mask"" (SSM). METHODS: A multidisciplinary team developed a reusable silicone half facepiece respirator over 9 prototype iterations. The manufacturing process consisted of 3D printing and silicone casting. Prototypes were assessed for comfort and breathability. Filtration was assessed by user seal checks and quantitative fit-testing according to CSA Z94.4-18. RESULTS: The respirator originally included a cartridge for holding filter material; this was modified to connect to standard heat-moisture exchange (HME) filters (N95 or greater) after the cartridge showed poor filtration performance due to flow acceleration around the filter edges, which was exacerbated by high filter resistance. All 8 HME-based iterations provided an adequate seal by user seal checks and achieved a pass rate of 87.5% (N = 8) on quantitative testing, with all failures occurring in the first iteration. The overall median fit-factor was 1662 (100 = pass). Estimated unit cost for a production run of 1000 using distributed manufacturing techniques is CAD $15 in materials and 20 minutes of labor. CONCLUSION: Small-scale manufacturing of an effective, reusable N95 respirator during a pandemic is feasible and cost-effective. Required quantities of reusables are more predictable and less vulnerable to supply chain disruption than disposables.

This article summarizes the potential benefits of erythropoietin (EPO) in alleviating SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis which is now called COVID-19. As with other coronavirus infection, the lethality of COVID-19 is associated with respiratory dysfunction due to overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the host immune responses. The resulting cytokine storm leads to the development of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). Erythropoietin, well known for its role in the regulation of erythropoiesis, may have protective effects against ALI/ARDS induced by viral and other pathogens. EPO exerts antiapoptotic and cytoprotective properties under various pathological conditions. With a high safety profile, EPO promotes the production of endothelial progenitor cells and reduce inflammatory processes through inhibition of the nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) and JAK-STAT3 signaling pathways. Thus, it may be considered as a safe drug candidate for COVID-19 patients if given at the early stage of the disease.

Our results, quantified using information theory measures, provide evidence for the existence of echo chambers across two dimensions represented by the political bias and by the trustworthiness of information channels. Finally, we observe that the echo chamber structure cannot be reproduced after properly randomizing the users' interaction patterns.","Marco, Niccolo Di; Cinelli, Matteo; Quattrociocchi, Walter",,278,3

The aim of this study was to evaluate how people with epilepsy (PWE) in Brazil is dealing with the pandemic, in relation to seizure frequency, access to antiseizure medicines (ASM), medical follow-up, and well-being. METHODS: An online questionnaire survey among PWE (group 1) and caregivers (group 2) was applied in the social networks of the Brazilian Association of Epilepsy, the official Brazilian chapter of the International Bureau for Epilepsy. The questionnaire was composed of 46 generic questions in four areas, namely, demographics and baseline clinical data as well as epilepsy and quality-of-life impact by COVID-19 pandemic based on the domains of the abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) instrument. RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 464 participants including 380 (81.9%) PWE (78.7% female; age 34.3 yrs.; ±9.76) and 84 (18.1%) caregivers (patients' age 14.1 yrs.; ±10.30). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 36.8% of PWE and 36.4% of caregivers reported difficulties in accessing the epilepsy healthcare provider, and visits occurred normally only in 29.7% of PWE and in 34.5% of the caregivers group. Telehealth was not provided for 66.6% of group 1 and for 58.5% of group 2. Lack of availability of ASM was reported by 21.9% of PWE and 28.0% of caregivers in public dispensing units and by 19.2% and 17.8%, respectively, in private pharmacies. Increase in seizures during pandemic was mentioned by 26.3% and 27.9% of groups 1 and 2, respectively. Patients who had increase in seizure frequency had more frequently reported problems with treatment and in quality-of-life concepts. Fear of having a more severe COVID-19 presentation because of epilepsy was reported by 74.5% of PWE and by 89.8% of caregivers. Dissatisfaction with current health status was reported by 36.7% and 38.1% in groups 1 and 2, respectively, and that the support from others has decreased (56.1% and 66.1%, in groups 1 and 2) during the pandemic. The factors with higher Odds Ratio of increase in seizure frequency during pandemic were age >41 yrs., treatment in public healthcare system, drug-resistant epilepsy, adversities in getting ASM in public dispensing units, difficulties with prescription renewals, current financial problems and belief that epilepsy or ASM are risk factors for contracting COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, PWE and caregivers reported increase in seizures in one-fourth of the patients and several difficulties, namely problems in accessing the healthcare system including ASM dispensation, telehealth, and fear of having a more severe COVID-19 because of epilepsy. There were also physical, psychological, and social concerns which affected quality-of-life-related aspects in this population. These facts may increase treatment gap in epilepsy in Brazil as well in other developing countries.","Guilhoto, Laura Maria; Mosini, Amanda Cristina; Susemihl, Maria Alice; Pinto, Lécio Figueira",Epilepsy Behav,278,1

This protease cleaves the viral polyprotein, but importantly in human host it also removes ubiquitin-like interferon-stimulated gene 15 protein (ISG15) from interferon responsive factor 3 (IRF3) protein which ultimately downregulates the production of type I interferon leading to weakening of immune response. GRL0617 is the most potent known inhibitor for PLpro that was initially developed for SARS outbreak of 2003. The PLpro of SARS-CoV and CoV2 share 83% sequence identity but interestingly have several identical conserved amino acids that suggests GRL0617 to be an effective inhibitor for PLpro of SARS-CoV2. GRL0617 is a naphthalene-based molecule and interacts with Tyr268 of SARS-CoV2-PLpro (and Tyr269 of SARS-CoV-PLpro). To identify PLpro inhibitors, we prepared a library of secondary metabolites from fungi with aromatic nature and docked them with PLpro of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2. We found six hits which interacts with Tyr268 of SARS-CoV2-PLpro (and Tyr269 of SARS-CoV-PLpro). More surprisingly the top hit, Fonsecin, has naphthalene moiety in its structure, which recruits Tyr268 of SARS-CoV2-PLpro (and Tyr269 of SARS-CoV-PLpro) and has binding energy at par with control (GRL0617). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation showed Fonsecin to interact with Tyr268 of SARS-CoV2-PLpro more efficiently than control (GRL0617) and interacting with a greater number of amino acids in the binding cleft of PLpro.","Rao, Priyashi; Patel, Rohit; Shukla, Arpit; Parmar, Paritosh; Rawal, Rakesh M; Saraf, Meenu; Goswami, Dweipayan",Mol. divers,278,24

Since December 2019, the SARS-COV-2 virus, which is the causative agent of COVID-19, has invaded the world causing high numbers of infections and deaths. The infection with SARS-COV-2 virus shows an abnormality in lung parenchyma that can be effectively detected using Computed Tomography (CT) imaging. In this paper, a novel computer aided framework (COV-CAF) is proposed for classifying the severity degree of the infection from 3D Chest Volumes. COV-CAF fuses traditional and deep learning approaches. The proposed COV-CAF consists of two phases: the preparatory phase and the feature analysis and classification phase. The preparatory phase handles 3D-CT volumes and presents an effective cut choice strategy for choosing informative CT slices. The feature analysis and classification phase incorporate fuzzy clustering for automatic Region of Interest (RoI) segmentation and feature fusion. In feature fusion, automatic features are extracted from a newly introduced Convolution Neural Network (Norm-VGG16) and are fused with spatial hand-crafted features extracted from segmented RoI. Experiments are conducted on MosMedData: Chest CT Scans with COVID-19 Related Findings with COVID-19 severity classes and SARS-COV-2 CT-Scan benchmark datasets. The proposed COV-CAF achieved remarkable results on both datasets. On MosMedData dataset, it achieved an overall accuracy of 97.76% and average sensitivity of 96.73%, while on SARS-COV-2 CT-Scan dataset it achieves an overall accuracy and sensitivity 97.59% and 98.41% respectively.","Ibrahim, Mohamed Ramzy; Youssef, Sherin M.; Fathalla, Karma M.",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,278,16

We investigated transcriptomic profiles in frontal cortex tissues of Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected Rhesus macaques sacrificed at different stages of infection. Gene expression was compared among SIV-infected animals (n = 11), with or without CD8+ lymphocyte depletion, based on detectable (n = 6) or non-detectable (n = 5) presence of the virus in frontal cortex tissues. Significant enrichment in activation of monocyte and macrophage cellular pathways was found in animals with detectable brain infection, independently from CD8+ lymphocyte depletion. In addition, transcripts of four poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) were up-regulated in the frontal cortex, which was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Our results shed light on involvement of PARPs in SIV infection of the brain and their role in SIV-associated neurodegenerative processes.

The relative importance of vaccination strategies and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of simulated COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and coverage scenarios with and without NPIs with infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An established agent-based decision analytical model was used to simulate COVID-19 transmission and progression from March 24, 2020, to September 23, 2021. The model simulated COVID-19 spread in North Carolina, a US state of 10.5 million people. A network of 1 017 720 agents was constructed from US Census data to represent the statewide population. EXPOSURES: Scenarios of vaccine efficacy (50% and 90%), vaccine coverage (25%, 50%, and 75% at the end of a 6-month distribution period), and NPIs (reduced mobility, school closings, and use of face masks) maintained and removed during vaccine distribution. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risks of infection from the start of vaccine distribution and risk differences comparing scenarios. Outcome means and SDs were calculated across replications. RESULTS: In the worst-case vaccination scenario (50% efficacy, 25% coverage), a mean (SD) of 2 231 134 (117 867) new infections occurred after vaccination began with NPIs removed, and a mean (SD) of 799 949 (60 279) new infections occurred with NPIs maintained during 11 months. In contrast, in the best-case scenario (90% efficacy, 75% coverage), a mean (SD) of 527 409 (40 637) new infections occurred with NPIs removed and a mean (SD) of 450 575 (32 716) new infections occurred with NPIs maintained. With NPIs removed, lower efficacy (50%) and higher coverage (75%) reduced infection risk by a greater magnitude than higher efficacy (90%) and lower coverage (25%) compared with the worst-case scenario (mean [SD] absolute risk reduction, 13% [1%] and 8% [1%], respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Simulation outcomes suggest that removing NPIs while vaccines are distributed may result in substantial increases in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, as NPIs are removed, higher vaccination coverage with less efficacious vaccines can contribute to a larger reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with more efficacious vaccines at lower coverage. These findings highlight the need for well-resourced and coordinated efforts to achieve high vaccine coverage and continued adherence to NPIs before many prepandemic activities can be resumed.","Patel, Mehul D.; Rosenstrom, Erik; Ivy, Julie S.; Mayorga, Maria E.; Keskinocak, Pinar; Boyce, Ross M.; Hassmiller Lich, Kristen; Smith, Raymond L.; Johnson, Karl T.; Delamater, Paul L.; Swann, Julie L.",JAMA Netw Open,278,16

Serological testing of 356 HD patients revealed that 129 (36.2%) patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Out of these 129 patients, 52 (40.3%) patients were asymptomatic (JASN 31:1969, 2020). In this study, we investigated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HD patients who were managed per Japanese Society for Dialysis-Therapy guidelines in the context of COVID-19. METHOD: Study (1): A total of, 55 patients that underwent HD (41 males, 14 females; mean age: 66.3±12.8 years, HD duration: 72.2±68.4 months) between August 1 and December 14, 2020, were included. We measured SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with a fully automated cobas e801 analyzer using an Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics) to qualitatively detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in human plasma. The Elecsys® assay uses a modified double-antigen sandwich immunoassay with recombinant nucleocapsid protein (N), which is geared towards the detection of late, mature, high-affinity antibodies independent of the subclass. Study (2): We tested the plasma of 8,982 adult with normal renal function for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between July 1 and November 18, 2020. RESULTS: Study (1): Using serological testing, only 2 out of 55 (3.64%) HD patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In total 54 patients were asymptomatic during the study period and did not have a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Only 1 out of the 54 (1.85%) patients that were asymptomatic had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Case 1 was an 89-year-old, male who had undergone HD for 53 months because of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) secondary to diabetic nephropathy. His blood type was O Rh (+). This patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on August 11, 2020. Serological testing showed that this patient had an asymptomatic disease. Case 2 was a 74-year-old, male that had undergone HD for 62 months due to ESKD secondary to diabetic nephropathy. He was hospitalized because of bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome on November 14, 2020. On that day, his PCR test was negative. He underwent surgery to insert a cardiac pacemaker on November 18, and had a fever (37.7°C) on November 24. A chest CT scan revealed that he had bilateral lung pneumonia. On that day, his PCR test was positive. Blood tests showed that his white blood cell count was 4300/μL (lymphocyte 30.4%), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels was 2.8 mg/dL. He was not treated with antiviral medication, the PCR test was repeated and was positive on December 4,7, and 9. However, his PCR test was negative on December 13. This patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on December 14. He recovered from a COVID-19 infection 21 days after the onset of the disease. Study (2): Using serological testing, 47 out of 8,982 (0.52%) adults tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In Japan, the population of Kanagawa prefecture is 9,216,009. The number of PCR-confirmed patients with COVID-19 infection was 13,340 (0.14%) on December 6, 2020. The estimated number of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was 47,923 (0.52%). The total estimated number of patients with COVID-19 infection was 61,263. In study 1, more than 90% of HD patients wear face masks, wash their hands, and maintain social distance of 2 m in dialysis facilities. Almost all patients avoided the three Cs (closed spaces with poor ventilation, crowded places with nearby people, close-contact settings, such as close-range conversations). CONCLUSION: We found that Japanese patients on HD had a lower prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared to those in the United Kingdom. Serological testing identified HD patients with asymptomatic disease. Avoiding the ‘three Cs’ is very important in minimizing the risk of COVID-19 among HD patients.","Taira, Takayasu",Nephrol Dial Transplant,278,8

Though both the number of cases and mortality rate in children and adolescents is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. To elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with COVID-19 Methods: In this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online databases. Pediatric cases of COVID-19 were defined as patients ≤19 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. The primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts. Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. Tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to Wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms. Results: A total of 82 patients were included. The median age was 10 [IQR: 5-15] years. Patients from mainland China (outside Hubei) accounted for 46.3% of cases, while the remaining 53.7% of cases were international. Males and females accounted for 52.4% and 32.9% of cases, respectively, with the remaining 14.6% being designated as unknown. A male skew persisted across subgroup analyses by age group (p=1.0) and location (inside/outside China) (p=0.22). While the number of reported international cases has been steadily increasing over the study period, the number of reported cases in China rapidly decreased from the start point. The median reporting delay was 3 [IQR: 2-4.8] days. The median delay between symptom onset and first seeking medical care was 1 [IQR: 0-3.25] day. In international cases, time to first seeking medical care was a median of 2.5 days longer than in China (p=0.04). When clinical features were reported, fever was the most common presentation (68.0%), followed by cough (36.0%). Conclusions: The number of reported international pediatric COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing. COVID-19 infections are, to-date, more common in males than females in both the children and adolescent age groups. Additionally, this male predominance remains the case both inside and outside of China. Crowdsourced data enabled early analysis of epidemiologic variables in pediatric patients with COVID-19. Further data sharing is required to enable analyses that are required to understand the course of this infection in children.","Henry, Brandon Michael; Oliveira, Maria Helena S",,278,24

The right to proper health care is universal, and the patient's autonomy must be respected even in ambiguous times. In the context of increased Cesarean section (CS) rates, the women's desire to achieve vaginal birth after Cesarean section (VBAC) is becoming more articulate, and healthcare professionals need to adapt their approaches regarding the mode of delivery. But how to balance this aspect with respect to the paucity of resources during the pandemic, without infringing the fundamental rights and ethical principles is a demanding question. This article describes a clinical ethical decision-making framework for recommending trial of labor after Cesarean section (TOLAC), and individualized management of VBAC cases tailored upon the new circumstances dictated by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Carauleanu, Alexandru; Tanasa, Ingrid Andrada; Nemescu, Dragos; Socolov, Demetra",Exp Ther Med,278,1

This is a result of the demographic change that is expressed by the increasing proportion of elderly people in society. Peri-operative management must be handled attentively to avoid complications and decrease mortality rates. To deal with the exceptional needs of the elderly, the development of orthogeriatric centres to support orthogeriatric co-management is mandatory. Adequate pain medication, balanced fluid management, delirium prevention and the operative treatment choice based on comorbidities, individual demands and biological rather than chronological age, all deserve particular attention to improve patients’ outcomes. The operative management of intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures favours intramedullary nailing. For femoral neck fractures, the Garden classification is used to differentiate between non-displaced and displaced fractures. Osteosynthesis is suitable for biologically young patients with non-dislocated fractures, whereas total hip arthroplasty and hemiarthroplasty are the main options for biologically old patients and displaced fractures. In bedridden patients, osteosynthesis might be an option to establish transferability from bed to chair and the restroom. Postoperatively, the patients benefit from early mobilisation and early geriatric care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, prolonged time until surgery and thus an increased rate of complications took a toll on frail patients with PFFs. This review aims to offer surgical guidelines for the treatment of PFFs in the elderly with a focus on pitfalls and challenges particularly relevant to frail patients.","Fischer, H.; Maleitzke, T.; Eder, C.; Ahmad, S.; Stöckle, U.; Braun, K.

Witnessing a substantial increase in the number of infections in Germany, the authorities have imposed drastic restrictions on everyday life,. Resulting panic buying and increasing home consumption had versatile impacts on transport volume and freight capacity dynamics in German food retail logistics. Due to the lack of prior research on the effects of COVID-19 on transport volume in retail logistics, as well as resulting implications, this article aspires to shed light on the phenomenon of changing volume and capacity dynamics in road haulage. After analyzing the transport volume of n = 15,715 routes in the timeframe of 23.03.2020 to 30.04.2020, a transport volume growth rate expressing the difference of real and expected transport volume was calculated. This ratio was then examined concerning the number of COVID-19 infections per day. The results of this study prove that the increasing freight volume for dry products in retail logistics does not depend on the duration of the COVID-19 epidemy but on the strength quantified through the total number of new infections per day. This causes a conflict of interest between transportation companies and food retail logistics for non-cooled transport capacity. The contributions of this paper are highly relevant to assess the impact of a possibly occurring second COVID-19 virus infection wave.","Loske, Dominic",Transportation research interdisciplinary perspectives,278,1

Nous rapportons ici le cas d’un patient contact de sujets confirmés au sein du cluster des Contamines-Montjoie, Haute Savoie, qui a développé au cours de son suivi une pneumonie associée au SARS-Cov-2 diagnostiquée par une aspiration endotrachéale (AET) testée positive alors que l’ensemble des ENPs réalisés sont restés négatifs. Matériels et méthodes Les caractéristiques cliniques du patient ont été suivies quotidiennement pendant la quarantaine dans un hôpital tertiaire français. Le diagnostic du SARS-Cov-2 était basé sur un test par RT-PCR développé par le Centre National de Référence pour les virus respiratoires ciblant le gène RdRp. D’autres pathogènes pulmonaires ont été recherchés en utilisant un FilmArray® RP2+(BioFire Diagnostics, SLC, États-Unis). Résultats Un homme de 53 ans avec pour seul antécédent une dyslipidémie traitée a été hospitalisé pour une mise en quarantaine après avoir été en contact avec des cas confirmés de COVID-19. À l’admission, le patient était asymptomatique et l’écouvillon nasopharyngé était négatif pour la détection du SARS-CoV-2. Au jour 5, il a présenté une fièvre isolée (38,1°C), sans signe d’infection des voies respiratoires hautes ou basses. La radiographie thoracique réalisée au jour 6 montrait un discret syndrome interstitiel bilatéral bi-basal. Une tomodensitométrie thoracique réalisée au jour 7 montrait des images éparses en verre dépoli de localisation périphérique au niveau du lobe inférieur gauche et du lobe moyen. Au niveau biologique, la seule anomalie identifiée était un minime syndrome inflammatoire (protéineC réactive à 12mg/L). La fièvre a persisté 3jours avec un maximum mesuré à 38,5°C. Les autres paramètres cliniques - dont la SpO2 - sont restés normaux, sans survenue d’autre symptôme jusqu’au jour 9, où le patient a présenté une toux sèche associée à une rhinorrhée. Une AET a été réalisée au jour 8 et est revenue positive pour le SARS-CoV-2. Ce résultat a été confirmé par un crachat induit le jour 9, tandis que l’ENP est demeuré toujours négatif. La recherche d’autres pathogènes respiratoires était négative (ENP et AET). Le suivi clinique de ce cas est toujours en cours. Conclusion Il s’agit de la première description de résultats dissociés entre un ENP négatif de manière persistante et une AET positive chez un patient atteint d’une pneumonie liée au SARS-CoV-2. Cette observation suggère que pour les patients à haut risque de COVID-19, même des symptômes bénins (comme un fébricule isolé) devraient inciter les cliniciens à effectuer une tomodensitométrie thoracique et un prélèvement des voies respiratoires inférieures pour dépister l’infection.","Benech, N.; Bouscambert-Duchamp, M.; Valour, F.; Conrad, A.; Roux, S.; Ferry, T.; Ader, F.; Perpoint, T.; Lina, B.; Chidiac, C.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,278,17

The patient reported in this case report is the youngest case reported in Chengdu, China to date. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 3-month-old male infant presented with cough and rhinorrhea. DIAGNOSIS: Family members from Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic came to stay in the patient's home 16 days before the onset of his disease, and his mother had been diagnosed with COVID-19. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 based on a history of exposure and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), detected using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). INTERVENTIONS: The patient was admitted to hospital and treated symptomatically with oral medication. OUTCOMES: The patient recovered completely and was discharged after one month of hospitalization. He tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR and a chest CT performed 4 weeks after admission showed marked improvement prior to discharge.

The role of inflammation on QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients was investigated. METHODS: Patients with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute (Milan, Italy) between March 14, 2020, and March 30, 2020 were included. QTc-I was defined as the QTc interval by Bazett formula in the first ECG performed during the hospitalization, before any new drug treatment; QTc-II was the QTc in the ECG performed after the initiation of hydroxychloroquine drug treatment. RESULTS: QTc-I was long in 45 patients (45%) and normal in 55 patients (55%). Patients with long QTc-I were older and more frequently males. C-Reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) count at hospitalization were higher in patients with long QTc-I and long QTc-II. QTc-I was significantly correlated with CRP levels at hospitalization. After a median follow-up of 83 days, 14 patients (14%) died. There were no deaths attributed to ventricular arrhythmias. Patients with long QTc-I and long QTc-II had a shorter survival, compared with normal QTc-I and QTc-II patients, respectively. In Cox multivariate analysis, independent predictors of mortality were age (HR = 1.1, CI 95% 1.04–1.18, p = 0.002) and CRP at ECG II (HR 1.1, CI 95% 1.0–1.1, p = 0.02).

On the other hand, the continuous-time Kermack-McKendrick epidemic model of 1927 (KM27) allows an arbitrary generation-time distribution, but it suffers from the drawback that its numerical implementation is rather cumbersome. Here, we introduce a discrete-time version of KM27 that is as general and flexible, and yet is very easy to implement computationally. Thus, it promises to become a very powerful tool for exploring control scenarios for specific infectious diseases such as COVID-19. To demonstrate this potential, we investigate numerically how the incidence-peak size depends on model ingredients. We find that, with the same reproduction number and the same initial growth rate, compartmental models systematically predict lower peak sizes than models in which the latent and the infectious period have fixed duration.","Diekmann, Odo; Othmer, Hans G; Planqué, Robert; Bootsma, Martin C J",Proc.

The sensitization of tumors using cryosensitizing agents prior to treatment enhances ablation efficiency and may improve clinical outcomes. Water efflux, which is regulated by aquaporin channels, contributes to cancer cell damage achieved through cryoablation. An increase in aquaporin (AQP) 3 is cryoprotective, whereas its inhibition augments cryodamage. The present study aimed to investigate aquaporin (AQP1, AQP3 and AQP5) gene expression and cellular localization in response to cryoinjury. Cultured breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) were exposed to freezing to induce cryoinjury. RNA and protein extracts were then analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively. Localization of aquaporins was studied using immunocytochemistry. Additionally, cells were transfected with small interfering RNA to silence aquaporin gene expression and cell viability was assessed using the Sulforhodamine B assay. Cryoinjury did not influence gene expression of AQPs, except for a 4-fold increase of AQP1 expression in MDA-MD-231 cells. There were no clear differences in AQP protein expression for either cell lines upon exposure to frozen and non-frozen temperatures, with the exception of fainter AQP5 bands for non-frozen MCF-7 cells. The exposure of cancer cells to freezing temperatures altered the localization of AQP1 and AQP3 proteins in both MCF-7 and MDA-MD-231 cells. The silencing of AQP1, AQP3 and AQP5 exacerbated MDA-MD-231 cell damage associated with freezing compared with control siRNA. This was also observed with AQP3 and AQP5 silencing in MCF-7 cells. Inhibition of aquaporins may potentially enhance cryoinjury. This cryosensitizing process may be used as an adjunct to breast cancer cryotherapy, especially in the border area targeted by cryoablation where freezing temperatures are not cold enough to induce cellular damage.","Alkhalifa, Haifa; Mohammed, Fatima; Taurin, Sebastien; Greish, Khaled; Taha, Safa; Fredericks, Salim",Oncol Lett,278,23

It is well documented that troponin predicts the prognosis of patients. Myoglobin is not only an important marker of myocardial injury, but it indicates systemic muscle damage. However, its relationship with COVID-19 was rarely reported. The present study compared the predictive value of troponin and myoglobin on the final prognosis of COVID-19 patients by analyzing the clinical characteristics and serum levels of myoglobin and troponin in severe/critical COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We enrolled 499 consecutive eligible hospitalized patients with severe/critical COVID-19 from February 14 to March 24, 2020 at Leishenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China. Clinical characteristics and laboratory data were collected and compared between the patients who died and survived. We analyzed the receiver operating characteristic curves of myoglobin and troponin. Then, the patients were divided into myo(+) group, myo(−) group, tro(+) group, and tro(−) group, and survival curves were analyzed. The prognostic predictable values of myoglobin and troponin were further analyzed using Cox multifactorial analysis. RESULTS: Myoglobin and troponin were significantly elevated in the death group (134.4 [interquartile range (IQR) 24.80, 605] vs 38.02 [IQR 3.87, 11.73] ng/ml, p < 0.001), and troponin was also significantly elevated in the death group (0.01 [IQR 0.01, 0.01] vs 0.04 [IQR 0.02, 0.15] ng/ml, p < 0.001). The ROC curves demonstrated that the area under the curve when using myoglobin to predict patient death was 0.911, with a threshold of 1.17, which was equivalent to troponin. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis revealed a significantly lower survival curve in the myo(+) group than the myo(−) group. Multifactor Cox survival analysis showed that troponin was no longer significant (HR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.92–1.03, p = 0.507), but elevated myoglobin was an independent predictor of death in COVID-19 patients (HR = 1.001, 95% CI 1.001–1.002, p < 0.001). The analysis of the Cox model for predicting patient death and plotting decision curves suggested that the single factor myoglobin model was superior to troponin, and the predictive value of the multifactor model was superior to the single-factor analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In severe/critical COVID-19 patients, myoglobin and troponin were predictors of mortality and the probability of conversion to critical illness, and myoglobin may be superior to troponin for predictive value.","Zhu, Feng; Li, Weifeng; Lin, Qiuhai; Xu, Mengdan; Du, Jiang; Li, Hongli",Med Clin (Engl Ed),278,33

As one of the main aims of science education is the promotion of students’ scientific literacy, one of the issues focused on teaching should be aspects of nature of science (NOS) – which can be introduced from discussions in socioscientific contexts. In this paper, we analyse the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to identify and discuss aspects of NOS involved in the production and communication of knowledge about it. We analyse selected scientific publications and reports from the general media, mainly focused on three broad topics about the production and validation of knowledge: (i) the characterisation of the virus, and (ii) the treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, and (iii) the communication of knowledge produced from the characterisation of scientific literature itself in the pandemic period. The analysis was carried out from a model that presents a broad and complex view of science, as it addresses several areas of knowledge and specific aspects of each of them and proposes the generation of one’s view of science from an integration of some of its distinct areas and/or aspects. The results show the current pandemic is a rich socioscientific context whose discussion of social, political, economic, and ethical aspects may support students’ learning of nature of science, thus fostering scientific literacy.","Maia, Poliana; Justi, Rosária; Santos, Monique",Sci Educ (Dordr),278,16

We sought to use wastewater-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 to assess the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals. Between August and December 2020, twice-weekly wastewater samples from three tertiary-care hospitals (totaling >2100 dedicated inpatient beds) were collected. Hospital-1 and Hospital-2 could be captured with a single sampling point whereas Hospital-3 required three separate monitoring sites. Wastewater samples were concentrated and cleaned using the 4S-silica column method and assessed for SARS-CoV-2 gene-targets (N1, N2 and E) and controls using RT-qPCR. Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 as measured by quantification cycle (Cq), genome copies and genomes normalized to the fecal biomarker PMMoV were compared to the total daily number of patients hospitalized with active COVID-19, confirmed cases of hospital-acquired infection, and the occurrence of unit-specific outbreaks. Of 165 wastewater samples collected, 159 (96%) were assayable. The N1-gene from SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 64.1% of samples, N2 in 49.7% and E in 10%. N1 and N2 in wastewater increased over time both in terms of the amount of detectable virus and the proportion of samples that were positive, consistent with increasing hospitalizations at those sites with single monitoring points (Pearson's r=0.679, P<0.0001, Pearson's r=0.799, P<0.0001, respectively). Despite increasing hospitalizations through the study period, nosocomial-acquired cases of COVID-19 (Pearson's r =0.389, P<0.001) and unit-specific outbreaks were discernable with significant increases in detectable SARS-CoV-2 N1-RNA (median 112 copies/ml) versus outbreak-free periods (0 copies/ml; P<0.0001).

Bats in China moved to Jeju Island and/or Taiwan in the last 20,000 years via the Korean Peninsula and/or Japan. The phylogenies of host mitochondrial D-loop DNA was not significantly congruent with those of bat adenovirus (m(2)(XY) = 0.07, p = 0.08), and bat alphacoronavirus (m(2)(XY) = 0.48, p = 0.20). We estimate that the first divergence time of bats carrying bat adenovirus in five caves studied (designated as K1, K2, JJ, N2, and F3) occurred approximately 3.17 million years ago. In contrast, the first divergence time of bat adenovirus among bats in the 5 caves was estimated to be approximately 224.32 years ago. The first divergence time of bats in caves CH, JJ, WY, N2, F1, F2, and F3 harboring bat alphacoronavirus was estimated to be 1.59 million years ago. The first divergence time of bat alphacoronavirus among the 7 caves was estimated to be approximately 2,596.92 years ago. The origin of bat adenovirus remains unclear, whereas our findings suggest that bat alphacoronavirus originated in Japan. Surprisingly, bat adenovirus and bat alphacoronavirus appeared to diverge substantially over the last 100 years, even though our gene-flow data indicate that the eastern bent-winged bat serves as an important natural reservoir of both viruses.","Kimprasit, Thachawech; Nunome, Mitsuo; Iida, Keisuke; Murakami, Yoshitaka; Wong, Min-Liang; Wu, Chung-Hsin; Kobayashi, Ryosuke; Hengjan, Yupadee; Takemae, Hitoshi; Yonemitsu, Kenzo; Kuwata, Ryusei; Shimoda, Hiroshi; Si, Lifan; Sohn, Joon-Hyuk; Asakawa, Susumu; Ichiyanagi, Kenji; Maeda, Ken; Oh, Hong-Shik; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Kimura, Junpei; Iida, Atsuo; Hondo, Eiichi",PLoS One,278,13

Various mitigation measures such as business closures have been imposed to reduce health risks. Such measures also limit economic activities and reduce emissions. Measures disproportionately affect the contact-intensive sectors such as the leisure and hospitality industry, as their economic activities involve more person-to-person interactions. Thus, the extent of emission reduction depends on the severity of a measure and the size of the contact-intensive sectors. Using data on business and restaurant closures, school closures and bans on gatherings across 50 U.S. states during the Covid-19 pandemic, an empirical analysis shows that emissions decrease more in states with a more stringent measure and a larger share of the contact-intensive sectors.

This study aimed to assess the size and scope of the available literature regarding the promotion of sustainable diets in the healthcare system and to obtain a reliable approximation of the processes and roles related to sustainable diet promotion within healthcare systems. A scoping review where online databases were used to identify English written scientific and grey literature published between 2000–2019 was carried out. The analytical–synthetic approach was used for data charting. Twelve studies were included that were published between 2007–2020. The data highlight education, community and clinical health services, community engagement and policy advocacy, and governance as main action areas along with two transversal aspects, social support, and gender. A systemic approach to the food system is emphasized. Evidence suggests that health professionals have the potential to drive a paradigm shift in food–health environments.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether an increase in severe EV-D68 respiratory infections was observed in our region. STUDY DESIGN: Samples from patients with respiratory symptoms were screened for viral pathogens, including rhinovirus and enterovirus. Subsequently, samples positive for rhinovirus and enterovirus were routinely sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, an additional method was used to detect EV-D68 specifically. RESULTS: During the first three quarters of the year 2014, 1896 respiratory samples were analyzed; 39 (2%) of them tested positive for enterovirus. Eighteen samples tested positive for EV-D68, obtained from 16 different patients admitted to our hospital. Eleven were children below the age of 18, of whom five children needed intensive care treatment. The remaining five samples were from adults, who all had an underlying disease; three were transplant patients (heart, lung and renal transplantation), the other two had an underlying lung condition (COPD, asthma). Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship with the strains circulating currently in the USA, all belonging to the known EV-D68 genetic subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: We observed an increase of EV-D68 infections in our population, both in children as well as in adult. In 2014 there have been 16 cases so far, compared to none in 2011 and 2013 and a single case in 2012.

Due to the rapidly evolving situation regarding this disease, the data reported in this article may be subject to modifications. The older population are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and to developing severe disease. The higher morbidity and mortality rates in older people have been associated with comorbidity, especially cardiovascular disease, and frailty, which weakens the immune response. Due to both the number of affected countries and the number of cases, the current situation constitutes an ongoing pandemic and a major health emergency.

Three COVID-19 clusters with distinct clinical features were identified by FAMD-based cluster analysis. The FAMD-based cluster analysis results indicated that the symptoms of COVID-19 were roughly consistent with the laboratory findings of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, symptoms for mild patients were atypical. Different hospital stay durations and survival differences among the three clusters were also found, and the more severe the clinical characteristics were, the worse the prognosis.

These are projected to increase as human–animal host contact increases owing to increasing environmental degradation that shrinks nature habitats for wildlife over the continent. The current outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for causing coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) has reinvigorated discourse on the disruptiveness of the zoonotic emerging infectious diseases, owing to their transboundary character. Even as the world focuses on the COVID-19 sweeping pandemic, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS)-CoV re-emerged in Saudi Arabia infecting 18 people with five deaths; this has barely received any attention. This outbreak is particularly of concern to the pastoralists in the Horn of Africa, a region that has in recent past seen an increase in camel trade with the Gulf States, especially Yemen and Saudi Arabia.

Currently, there is no effective approved vaccine for CCHF. In this study, we used a computer-aided vaccine design approach to develop the first multi-epitope recombinant vaccine for CCHF. For this purpose, linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from two structural glycoproteins of CCHF virus including Gc and Gn were predicted. The epitopes were further studied regarding their antigenicity, allergenicity, hydrophobicity, stability, toxicity and population coverage. A total number of seven epitopes including five T-cell and two B-cell epitopes were screened for the final vaccine construct. Final vaccine construct composed of 382 amino acid residues which were organized in four domains including linear B-cell, T-cell epitopes and cholera toxin B-subunit (CTxB) along with heat labile enterotoxin IIc B subunit (LT-IIc) as adjuvants. All the segments were joined using appropriate linkers. The physicochemical properties as well as the presence of IFN-γ inducing epitopes in the proposed vaccine, was also checked to determining the vaccine stability, solubility and its ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses. The 3D structure of proposed vaccine was subjected to the prediction of computational B-cell epitopes and molecular docking studies with MHC-I and II molecules. Furthermore, molecular dynamics stimulations were performed to study the vaccine-MHCs complexes stability during stimulation time. The results suggest that our proposed vaccine was stable, well soluble in water and potentially antigenic. Results also demonstrated that the vaccine can induce both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and could serve as a promising anti-CCHF vaccine candidate.","Nosrati, Mokhtar; Behbahani, Mandana; Mohabatkar, Hassan",J Biomed Inform,278,1

The work presented here addresses this problem from a Data Quality (DQ) perspective, adapting the traditional methods used in relational databases, based on quality dimensions and metrics, to capture the characteristics of Twitter data streams in particular, and of Big Data in a more general sense. Therefore, as a first contribution, this paper re-defines the classic DQ dimensions and metrics for the scenario under study. Second, the paper introduces a software tool that allows capturing Twitter data streams in real time, computing their DQ and displaying the results through a wide variety of graphics. As a third contribution of this paper, using the aforementioned machinery, a thorough analysis of the DQ of Twitter streams is performed, based on four dimensions: Readability, Completeness, Usefulness, and Trustworthiness. These dimensions are studied for several different cases, namely unfiltered data streams, data streams filtered using a collection of keywords, and classifying tweets referring to different topics, studying the DQ for each topic. Further, although it is well known that the number of geolocalized tweets is very low, the paper studies the DQ of tweets with respect to the place from where they are posted. Last but not least, the tool allows changing the weights of each quality dimension considered in the computation of the overall data quality of a tweet. This allows defining weights that fit different analysis contexts and/or different user profiles. Interestingly, this study reveals that the quality of Twitter streams is higher than what would have been expected.","Arolfo, Franco; Rodriguez, Kevin Cortés; Vaisman, Alejandro",Inf Syst Front,278,16

Usually, viral protein targets host proteins in an organized fashion. The pathogen may target cell signaling pathways to disrupt the pathway genes regular activities, resulting in disease. Understanding the interaction mechanism of viral and host proteins involved in different signaling pathways may help decipher the attacking mechanism on the signal transmission during diseases, followed by discovering appropriate therapeutic solutions. The expression of any viral gene depends mostly on the host translational machinery. Recent studies report the great significance of codon usage biases in establishing host-viral protein-protein interactions (PPI). Exploiting the codon usage patterns between a pair of co-evolved host and viral proteins may present novel insight into the host-viral protein interactomes during disease pathogenesis. Leveraging the codon usage pattern similarity (and dissimilarity), we propose a computational scheme to recreate the hostviral protein interaction network (HVPPI). We use seventeen (17) essential signaling pathways for our current work and study the possible targeting mechanism of SARS-CoV2 viral proteins on such pathway proteins. We infer both negatively and positively interacting edges in the network. We can find a relationship where one host protein may target by more than one viral protein. Extensive analysis performed to understand the network topologically and the attacking behavior of the viral proteins. Our study reveals that viral proteins, mostly utilize codons, rare in the targeted host proteins (negatively correlated interaction). Among non-structural proteins, NSP3 and structural protein, Spike (S) protein, are the most influential proteins in interacting multiple host proteins. In ranking the most affected pathways, MAPK pathways observe to be worst affected during the COVID-19 disease. A good number of targeted proteins are highly central in host protein interaction networks. Proteins participating in multiple pathways are also highly connected in their own PPI and mostly targeted by multiple viral proteins.","Das, Jayanta; Chakrobarty, Subhadip; Roy, Swarup",bioRxiv,278,2

It has been documented in many countries that healthcare workers are at increased occupational risk of COVID-19. We aimed to estimate the burden of COVID-19 on Australia healthcare workers and the health system by obtaining and organizing data on HCW infections, analyzing national HCW cases in regards to occupational risk and analyzing healthcare outbreak. METHODS: We searched government reports and websites and media reports to create a comprehensive line listing of Australian healthcare worker infections and nosocomial outbreaks between January 25(th) and July 8(th), 2020. A line list of healthcare worker related COVID-19 reported cases was created and enhanced by matching data extracted from media reports of healthcare related COVID-19 relevant outbreaks and reports, using matching criteria. Rates of infections and odds ratios (ORs) for healthcare workers were calculated per state, by comparing overall cases to healthcare worker cases. To investigate the sources of infection amongst healthcare workers, transmission data were collated and graphed to show distribution of sources. RESULTS: We identified 36 hospital outbreaks or outbreaks between January 25(th) and July 8(th), 2020. According to our estimates, at least 536 healthcare workers in Australia have been infected with COVID-19, comprising 6.03% of all reported infections. The rate of healthcare worker infection was 72/100,000 and of community infection 34/100,000. healthcare workers were 2.76 times more likely to contract COVID-19 (95% CI 2.53 to 3.01; P<0.001). The timing of hospital outbreaks did not always correspond to community peaks. Where data were available, a total of 131 healthcare workers across 21 outbreaks, led to 1656 healthcare workers being furloughed for quarantine. One hospital was closed and had 1200 workers quarantined in one outbreak. CONCLUSION: The study shows that HCWs were at nearly 3 times the risk of infection. Of concern, this nearly tripling of risk occurred during a period of low community prevalence suggesting failures at multiple hazard levels including PPE policies within the work environment. Even in a country with relatively good control of COVID-19, healthcare workers are at greater risk of infection than the general community and nosocomial outbreaks can have substantial effects on workforce capacity by the quarantine of numerous workers during an outbreak. The occurrence of hospital outbreaks even when community incidence was low, highlights the high risk setting that hospitals present. Australia faces a resurgence of COVID-19 since late June 2020, with multiple hospital outbreaks.

A colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for IgM/IgG antibodies against the receptor‐binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) S1 protein was established to assess its rapid diagnostic value. We first designed and manufactured all contents of the test cassette of SARS‐CoV‐2 rapid test kit: the colloidal gold‐labeled mouse‐antihuman lgM/lgG antibody, the recombinant SARS‐CoV‐2 antigen, the nitrocellulose membrane control line, and specimen diluents. Furthermore, reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) assay, colloidal gold immunochromatography assay, serological validation of cross reaction with other common viruses, and clinical validation were performed. The kit was finally evaluated by 75 serum/plasma samples of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection cases and 139 healthy samples as control, with the result of that the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for IgM were 90.67%, 97.84%, and 95.33%, whereas for IgG were 69.33%, 99.28%, and 88.79%, respectively; the combination of IgM and IgG could improve the value: 92.00%, 97.12%, and 95.33%, respectively. Therefore, the rapid detection kit has high sensitivity and specificity, especially for IgM&IgG, showing a critical value in clinical application and epidemic control of COVID‐19.","Li, Hua; Liu, Zhe; He, Yue; Qi, Yingjie; Chen, Jie; Ma, Yuanyuan; Liu, Fujia; Lai, Kaisheng; Zhang, Yong; Jiang, Liu; Wang, Xiangdong; Ge, Junbo",Clin Transl Med,278,13

Several hypotheses regarding central lesions in these patients are conceivable. Here, we describe two acute SARS-CoV-2- infected patients who developed neurological symptoms evoking the condition of clinical cognitive motor dissociation (CMD). This diagnosis could be confirmed first by clinical observation of a dissociation between preserved cognitive abilities and lack of initial motor interaction and second, by performing (18)F- FDG PET imaging. Accurate diagnosis led to an appropriate neuro-rehabilitation regimen with long-term neuro-rehabilitation leading to an improved outcome for both patients.","Vijiala, Sergiu; Epiney, Jean-Benoît; Jöhr, Jane; Pincherle, Alessandro; Meyer, Marie M.; Du Pasquier, Renaud; Prior, John O.; Diserens, Karin",Front Neurol,278,1

However, data are limited on how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters and spreads in a population. METHODS: We targeted testing to persons living in Iceland who were at high risk for infection (mainly those who were symptomatic, had recently traveled to high-risk countries, or had contact with infected persons). We also carried out population screening using two strategies: issuing an open invitation to 10,797 persons and sending random invitations to 2283 persons. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 643 samples. RESULTS: As of April 4, a total of 1221 of 9199 persons (13.3%) who were recruited for targeted testing had positive results for infection with SARS-CoV-2. Of those tested in the general population, 87 (0.8%) in the open-invitation screening and 13 (0.6%) in the random-population screening tested positive for the virus. In total, 6% of the population was screened. Most persons in the targeted-testing group who received positive tests early in the study had recently traveled internationally, in contrast to those who tested positive later in the study. Children under 10 years of age were less likely to receive a positive result than were persons 10 years of age or older, with percentages of 6.7% and 13.7%, respectively, for targeted testing; in the population screening, no child under 10 years of age had a positive result, as compared with 0.8% of those 10 years of age or older. Fewer females than males received positive results both in targeted testing (11.0% vs. 16.7%) and in population screening (0.6% vs. 0.9%). The haplotypes of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses were diverse and changed over time. The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based study in Iceland, children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males. The proportion of infected persons identified through population screening did not change substantially during the screening period, which was consistent with a beneficial effect of containment efforts.

Constraints in vaccine supply and distribution capacity, together with the rise of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, have sparked a policy debate on whether to vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the second dose, or to continue with the recommended two-dose series as tested in clinical trials. We developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission to compare the impact of these two vaccination strategies, while varying the temporal waning of vaccine efficacy against disease following the first dose, vaccine efficacy against infection, and the level of pre-existing immunity in the population. Our results show that for Moderna vaccines with 80% efficacy following the first dose, a delay of 9–12 weeks could enhance the program effectiveness and prevent additional infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, compared to a 4-week interval between the doses. However, for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines with demonstrated efficacy of 52% after the first dose, there was no clear advantage for delaying the second dose beyond the 3-week tested schedule, unless the efficacy of the first dose did not wane over time. Our findings underscore the importance of quantifying the durability of vaccine-induced protection after the first dose as well as vaccine efficacy against infection in order to determine the optimal time interval between the two doses.","Moghadas, Seyed M.; Vilches, Thomas N.; Zhang, Kevin; Nourbakhsh, Shokoofeh; Sah, Pratha; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C.; Galvani, Alison P.",medRxiv,278,1

This analysis presents findings from the summative usability testing process for the single‐dose semaglutide pen‐injectors, including the pen‐injector four‐pack cartons and instructions for use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 adults representing four user groups were included: patients with/without pen‐injector experience, non‐pharmacist healthcare professionals and pharmacists (each n = 15). Participants carried out four tasks: (i) pen‐injector carton retrieval; (ii) first simulated injection; (iii) pen‐injector retrieval; and (iv) second simulated injection. All participants carried out task 1, and patients and non‐pharmacist healthcare professionals took part in tasks 2–4 (n = 45). The number and types of use errors, close calls and operational difficulties were evaluated, and participants subjectively rated the ease of each task on a scale of 1 (difficult) to 7 (easy). RESULTS: No potentially serious use errors and only one non‐serious use error were reported. Eight participants committed use errors with no potential for harm, one participant committed an unclassified use error, one participant encountered a close call with no potential for harm and one participant experienced an operational difficulty. Mean ease‐of‐use ratings were 6.7 (task 1), 5.9 (task 2), 6.6 (task 3) and 6.9 (task 4). CONCLUSIONS: All three dose variants of the semaglutide single‐dose pen‐injector were considered easy to use (subjective feedback scores near 7) and not associated with any serious use errors, even when participants received no training before study participation.","Klonoff, David C; Bassock, Stephanie; Dwyer, Andrea; Engels, Ella; Qvist, Marianne; Sparre, Thomas; Snitker, Soren",J Diabetes Investig,278,29

We show that vaccination with HAd5 expressing the nucleocapsid (N) protein can establish protective immunity, defined by reduced weight loss and viral load, in both Syrian hamsters and k18-hACE2 mice. Challenge of vaccinated mice was associated with rapid N-specific T cell recall responses in the respiratory mucosa.

Many institutions implemented a government-mandated restructured set of safety and administrative protocols to treat urgent orthopaedic trauma patients. The objective of this study was to compare two cohorts of patients, a COVID group and non-COVID control group, and to evaluate the effectiveness of safety measures outlined in the Rutgers Orthopaedic Trauma Patient Safety Protocol (ROTPSP). Secondary outcomes were to elucidate risk factors for complications associated with fractures and COVID-19. METHODS: Patients treated for orthopaedic traumatic injuries were retrospectively identified between March and May 2020, and compared to a series of patients from the same time period in 2018. Main outcome measures included surgical site infections (SSI), length of stay (LOS), post-operative LOS (poLOS), presentation to OR time (PORT), and length of surgery. RESULTS: After review, 349 patients (201 non-COVID, 148 COVID) undergoing 426 surgeries were included. Average LOS (11.91 days vs. 9.27 days, p = 0.04), poLOS (9.68 days vs. 7.39 days, p = 0.03), and PORT (30.56 vs. 25.59 h, p < 0.01) was significantly shorter in the COVID cohort. There were less SSI in the COVID group (5) compared to the non-COVID group (14) (p = 0.03). Overall complications were significantly lower in the COVID group. Patients receiving Cepheid tests had significantly shorter LOS and poLOS compared to patients receiving the RNA and DiaSorin tests (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively). The Cepheid test carried the best benefit-to-cost ratio, 0.10, p < 0.05. CONCLUSION: The restructuring of care protocols caused by COVID-19 did not negatively impact perioperative complication rates, PORT or LOS. Cepheid COVID test type administered upon admission plays an integral role in a patient's hospital course by reducing both length of stay and hospital costs. This information demonstrates we can continue to treat orthopaedic trauma patients safely during the COVID-19 pandemic by utilizing strict safety protocols.","Batko, Brian D.; Hreha, Jeremy; Potter, James S.; Guinand, Luis; Reilly, Mark C.; Sirkin, Michael S.; Vosbikian, Michael M.; Adams, Mark R.",J Clin Orthop Trauma,278,27

However, one safety concern of vaccination is the possible development of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential infection of Fc receptor bearing cells such as macrophages, would support continued virus replication and inflammatory responses, and thereby potentially worsen the clinical outcome of COVID-19. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV neither infect human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) nor induce inflammatory cytokines in these cells, in sharp contrast to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and the common cold human coronavirus 229E. Furthermore, serum from convalescent COVID-19 patients neither induced enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection nor innate immune response in hMDM. Although, hMDM expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, no or very low levels of transmembrane protease serine 2 were found. These results support the view that ADE may not be involved in the immunopathological processes associated with COVID-19, however, more studies are necessary to understand the potential contribution of antibodies-virus complexes with other cells expressing FcR receptors.","García-Nicolás, Obdulio; V’kovski, Philip; Zettl, Ferdinand; Zimmer, Gert; Thiel, Volker; Summerfield, Artur",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,278,28

Plus rarement, elles sont un signe d’interféronopathie, groupe de maladie monogénique caractérisé par une forte production d’interferon de type 1 (INF-1). Les engelures ont constitué la plus fréquente des manifestations cutanées associées à la COVID-19. Toutefois, la majorité de ces « engelures épidémiques » (EE) ont présenté des tests virologiques pour le SARS-CoV-2 négatifs. Afin de mieux caractériser ces EE et de préciser leur lien avec le SARS-CoV-2, nous avons étudié leur profil clinique et paraclinique et les avons comparés à un groupe de lupus engelure (LE). Matériel et méthodes Il s’agit d’une cohorte rétrospective d’adultes ayant présenté un premier épisode d’engelures entre février et avril 2020 et suspects de COVID-19 (car ils en présentaient des symptômes ou rapportaient un contage). Les patients avec un facteur déclenchant exogène évident ou une maladie auto-immune connue ont été exclus. Les données clinicobiologiques, histologiques, immunohistochimiques (appréciation de l’activité IFN-1 par le MxA, marquage des cellules dendritiques plasmocytoïdes sécrétrices d’IFN par le CD123) et virologiques ont été recueillies et comparées à un groupe de 11 LE. Résultats Sept patients ont été inclus (F 57 % ; âge moyen 42 ans) dans le groupe EE. La localisation limitée aux pieds et l’absence d’anticorps anti-nucléaires étaient plus fréquemment observées chez les EE que les LE. Les lésions de vasculite lymphocytaire étaient plus fréquentes dans le groupe EE. Les deux groupes présentaient des marqueurs de forte sécrétion d’IFN-I. Les PCR SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngées, cutanées et sanguines étaient négatives. Les sérologies (IgG et IgA) réalisées au minimum 21jours après le début des symptômes étaient également négatives, hormis pour une patiente (positivité isolée des IgA). Discussion Nos résultats identifient les engelures comme un signe clinique de forte sécrétion d’IFN-I. Aucune cause usuelle d’engelure n’a été trouvée chez nos patients EE et tous étaient suspects de COVID-19. L’hypothèse chez ces patients d’une forte réponse antivirale IFN-I contre le SARS-CoV-2 expliquerait l’absence de forme grave de COVID-19, d’une part, et la survenue des engelures, d’autre part. La négativité des PCR peut s’expliquer notamment par l’activité anti-réplicative virale de l’IFN-1, connue dans le MERS-CoV. La négativité des sérologies pourrait s’expliquer par une déplétion lymphocytaire B transitoire induite par l’INF-1, ainsi que décrite chez l’animal en réponse à une infection au virus de la chorioméningite lymphocytaire. L’illustration d’un contrôle optimal de l’infection par le SARS-CoV-2 chez des patients capables d’une forte réponse immunitaire innée (réponse IFN-I) est un argument pour proposer précocement aux patients infectés et à risque un traitement par IFN.","Battesti, G.; El-Khalifa, J.; Mekki, N.; Ferre, V.; Bouscarat, F.; Picard-Dahan, C.; Brunet-Possenti, F.; Lavaud, J.; Tournier, A.; Rousselot, M.; Le Bozec, P.; Lheure, C.; Deschamps, L.; Descamps, V.",Annales de Dermatologie et de Vénéréologie,278,30

Detection of norovirus in fecal samples is now common in routine tests for enteric pathogens using molecular methods. We observed a change in positivity rates for norovirus after the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in our laboratory and performed a more detailed analysis of testing results. METHODS: We reviewed the positivity rates for detection of common enteric pathogens from stool samples submitted to an academic medical center laboratory pre (2016–2019) and post the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020). RESULTS: In contrast to other enteric pathogens, norovirus positivity rates dropped dramatically from a yearly average of 3.9% in 2016–2019 to 0.76% from March 2020 through the end of 2020. CONCLUSION: A sustained reduction in norovirus positivity rates was temporally associated with COVID-19 mitigation processes in the Philadelphia area, while positivity rates for other common enteric pathogens were only intermittently reduced.","Nachamkin, Irving; Richard-Greenblatt, Melissa; Yu, Mei; Bui, Hong",Infect Dis Ther,278,16

Epidemiological surveillance of the ongoing pandemic has demonstrated a male vulnerability to morbidity and mortality, despite similar infection rates between the two sexes. Divergence in the frequency of comorbidities between males and females, differences in hormonal profile, chromosomal composition and gender behavior have all been proposed as potential causative factors. Data deriving from the immunization process indirectly support the existence of a sex-specific response to SARS-CoV-2, since females apparently produce higher numbers of antibodies while simultaneously exhibiting higher rates of side effects, indicating a stronger immune reactivity to the vaccine’s elements. Interpreting intersex differences in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 could lead to a deeper understanding of the COVID-19 pathophysiology and enable healthcare professionals to conduct a more accurate patient risk assessment and better predict the clinical outcome of the disease. This narrative review aims to discuss the pathophysiological and behavioral basis of the disproportionate male morbidity and mortality observed in COVID-19, in the context of most research findings in the field.","Pegiou, Stavroula; Rentzeperi, Elpiniki; Koufakis, Theocharis; Metallidis, Symeon; Kotsa, Kalliopi",Microbes Infect,278,1

In humans, sexual dimorphism in the immune response has been well demonstrated, with females exhibiting lower infection rates than males for a variety of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens. There is also a substantially increased incidence of autoimmune disease in females compared to males. Together, these trends indicate that females have a heightened immune reactogenicity to both self and non-self-molecular patterns. However, the molecular mechanisms driving the sexually dimorphic immune response are not fully understood. The female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, as well as the male androgens, such as testosterone, elicit direct effects on the function and inflammatory capacity of immune cells. Several studies have identified a sex-specific transcriptome and methylome, independent of the well-described phenomenon of X-chromosome inactivation, suggesting that sexual dimorphism also occurs at the epigenetic level. Moreover, distinct alterations to the transcriptome and epigenetic landscape occur in synchrony with periods of hormonal change, such as puberty, pregnancy, menopause, and exogenous hormone therapy. These changes are also mirrored by changes in immune cell function. This review will outline the evidence for sex hormones and pregnancy-associated hormones as drivers of epigenetic change, and how this may contribute to the sexual dimorphism. Determining the effects of sex hormones on innate immune function is important for understanding sexually dimorphic autoimmune diseases, sex-specific responses to pathogens and vaccines, and how innate immunity is altered during periods of hormonal change (endogenous or exogenous).","Shepherd, Rebecca; Cheung, Ada S.; Pang, Ken; Saffery, Richard; Novakovic, Boris",Front Immunol,278,33

To carry out analysis of intra-strand nucleotide distribution several graphical methods have been developed. RESULTS: GraphDNA is a new Java application that provides a simple, user-friendly interface for the visualization of DNA nucleotide composition. The program accepts GenBank, EMBL and FASTA files as an input, and it displays multiple DNA nucleotide composition graphs (skews and walks) in a single window to allow direct comparisons between the sequences. We illustrate the use of DNA skews for characterization of poxvirus and coronavirus genomes. CONCLUSION: GraphDNA is a platform-independent, Open Source, tool for the analysis of nucleotide trends in DNA sequences.

NAFLD has become one of the most common indications for liver transplantation. The deleterious effects of NAFLD are not isolated to the liver only, for it has been recognized as a systemic disease affecting multiple organs through protracted low-grade inflammation mediated by the metabolic activity of excessive fat tissue. Extrahepatic manifestations of NAFLD such as cardiovascular disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and hypothyroidism have been well described in the literature. In recent years, it has become evident that patients suffering from NAFLD might be at higher risk of developing various infections. The proposed mechanism for this association includes links through hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, alterations in innate immunity, obesity, and vitamin D deficiency. Additionally, a risk independent of these factors mediated by alterations in gut microbiota might contribute to a higher burden of infections in these individuals. In this narrative review, we synthetize current knowledge on several infections including urinary tract infection, pneumonia, Helicobacter pylori, coronavirus disease 2019, and Clostridioides difficile as they relate to NAFLD.

Repurposing of existing drugs can be a rapid and effective strategy to fight the infection. Clinical trials have reported reduction or elimination of viral load when patients were treated with the anti-malarial drug Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). To understand the molecular mechanism of action for effective repurposing of this drug we have carried out in silico docking and dynamics studies on complexes between HCQ and target proteins, which were identified through both literature survey and structural similarity searches in databases of small molecule – protein complexes. The proteins identified as binding HCQ are: Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), α7 nicotinic AcetylCholine Receptor (α7 nAChR), α1D-adrenergic receptor (α1D-AR), Histamine N- Methyl Transferase (HNMT) and DNA gyrase/Topoisomerase III β (Top3β). The majority of these proteins are novel and have not been used before, in docking studies. Our docking and simulation results support action of HCQ both at the entry and post-entry stages of SARS-CoV2 infection. The mechanism of action at the entry stage is through blocking the virus-binding sites on the two receptors, ACE2 & α7 nAChR, by binding directly at those sites. Our computational studies also show that the action of HCQ at the post-entry stage is to prevent both viral replication and generation of ‘cytokine storm’ by inhibiting host Top3β enzyme and α1D-AR, respectively. Binding of HCQ to HNMT is not a desired binding, and therefore this should be reduced during repurposing of HCQ.","Navya, V.B.; Hosur, M.V.",Inform Med Unlocked,278,20

METHODS Using a qualitative design, 14 circus arts students from the National Institute of Circus Arts (Australia) were individually interviewed via teleconsultation. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS Five overarching themes were identified: (i) impact (physical and mental), (ii) opportunity, (iii) developing routine, (iv) client-therapist relationship, and (v) transformation. All participants reported positive physical changes to their shoulder including increases in strength, stability, range of motion, less pain, ""clicking"" and ""clunking,"" improved posture, muscle memory, as well as carry-over to functional circus activities. The pandemic's mental impact varied across the cohort, with positive and negative experiences described in relation to cognitive, social, and affective factors. Most performers felt the pandemic provided an opportunity to focus on rehabilitation of their shoulder. The program effects were also underpinned by positive client-therapist relationships and a progressive transformation of learning where students gained knowledge of their condition, developed tools to manage their current shoulder impairment, and learned how to apply this new knowledge to future management of their condition. CONCLUSION A shoulder exercise intervention delivered via teleconsultation during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in subjective reports of positive physical changes to the participants' shoulder health complaint. This was facilitated through client-physiotherapist relationships, providing structure during uncertain times, and by providing education to help in understanding their condition and its future management.","Ganderton, Charlotte; Rayner, A; Barradell, S; Munro, D; Watson, L; Knowles, S R",Medical problems of performing artists,278,3

We aimed to quantify potential drivers of this change and identify groups of patients who remain at high risk of dying in hospital. METHODS: In this multicentre prospective observational cohort study, the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK recruited a prospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 admitted to 247 acute hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales during the first wave of the pandemic (between March 9 and Aug 2, 2020). We included all patients aged 18 years and older with clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 or confirmed COVID-19 (by RT-PCR test) from assumed community-acquired infection. We did a three-way decomposition mediation analysis using natural effects models to explore associations between week of admission and in-hospital mortality, adjusting for confounders (demographics, comorbidities, and severity of illness) and quantifying potential mediators (level of respiratory support and steroid treatment). The primary outcome was weekly in-hospital mortality at 28 days, defined as the proportion of patients who had died within 28 days of admission of all patients admitted in the observed week, and it was assessed in all patients with an outcome. This study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN66726260. FINDINGS: Between March 9, and Aug 2, 2020, we recruited 80 713 patients, of whom 63 972 were eligible and included in the study. Unadjusted weekly in-hospital mortality declined from 32·3% (95% CI 31·8–32·7) in March 9 to April 26, 2020, to 16·4% (15·0–17·8) in June 15 to Aug 2, 2020. Reductions in mortality were observed in all age groups, in all ethnic groups, for both sexes, and in patients with and without comorbidities. After adjustment, there was a 32% reduction in the risk of mortality per 7-week period (odds ratio [OR] 0·68 [95% CI 0·65–0·71]). The higher proportions of patients with severe disease and comorbidities earlier in the first wave (March and April) than in June and July accounted for 10·2% of this reduction. The use of respiratory support changed during the first wave, with gradually increased use of non-invasive ventilation over the first wave. Changes in respiratory support and use of steroids accounted for 22·2%, OR 0·95 (0·94–0·95) of the reduction in in-hospital mortality. INTERPRETATION: The reduction in in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 during the first wave in the UK was partly accounted for by changes in the case-mix and illness severity. A significant reduction in in-hospital mortality was associated with differences in respiratory support and critical care use, which could partly reflect accrual of clinical knowledge. The remaining improvement in in-hospital mortality is not explained by these factors, and could be associated with changes in community behaviour, inoculum dose, and hospital capacity strain.

Conversely, some reports of previous epidemics describe NIV as a very efficient and safe modality of respiratory support, if strict infection control measures are implemented. We discuss NIV use during epidemics and indicate the need for prospective randomized clinical studies on the efficacy of NIV in epidemic conditions to provide important information to the current body of literature.

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is known as COVID-19. To date, few treatments for COVID-19 have proven effective, and the current standard of care is primarily supportive. As a result, novel therapeutic strategies are in high demand. Viral entry into target cells is frequently sensitive to cell membrane lipid composition and membrane organization. Evidence suggests that cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is most efficient when the target cell plasma membrane is replete with cholesterol; and recent data implicate cholesterol flux through the high-affinity receptor for cholesterol-rich high-density lipoprotein (HDL), called scavenger receptor type B-1 (SR-B1), as critical for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Here, we demonstrate that a cholesterol-poor synthetic biologic high-density lipoprotein (HDL NP) targets SR-B1 and inhibits cell entry of a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus. Human cells expressing SR-B1 are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and viral entry can be inhibited by 50-80% using HDL NPs in an SR-B1-dependent manner. These results indicate that HDL NP targeting of SR-B1 is a powerful potential therapy to combat COVID-19 and other viral diseases.","Henrich, Stephen E.; McMahon, Kaylin M.; Palacio, Nicole; Bhalla, Pankaj; Penaloza-MacMaster, Pablo; Thaxton, C.

Several factors have been linked to attenuating such decline in cognitive flexibility, such as education, physical exercise and stimulating leisure activities. Speaking two or more languages has recently received abundant attention as another factor that may build up cognitive reserve, thereby limiting the functional implications of compromised cognition that accompany old age. With the number of older adults reaching record levels, it is important to attenuate the development of old-age disorders. Learning to speak a foreign language might offer a powerful tool in promoting healthy aging, but up to date effect studies are sparse. Here, the protocol that forms the foundation of the current study is presented. The present study aims to: (1) examine the effects of a foreign language training on cognitive flexibility and its neural underpinnings, and on mental health; and (2) assess the unique role of foreign language training vs. other cognitive or social programs. Method: One-hundred and ninety-eight Dutch elderly participants reporting subjective cognitive decline are included and randomized to either a language intervention, a music intervention, or a social control intervention. During 3 to 6 months, the language group learns English, the music group learns to play the guitar and the social group participates in social meetings where art workshops are offered. At baseline, at a 3-month follow-up, and at 6 months after termination of the training program, clinical, cognitive and brain activity measurements (combined EEG and fNIRS methods) are taken to assess cognitive flexibility and mental health. Discussion: This is the first trial addressing combined effects of language learning in elderly on cognition, language proficiency, socio-affective measures, and brain activity in the context of a randomized controlled trial. If successful, this study can provide insights into how foreign language training can contribute to more cognitively and mentally healthy years in older adulthood.

This illness is poorly understood as it affects COVID-19 survivors at all levels of disease severity, even younger adults, children, and those not hospitalized. While the precise definition of long COVID may be lacking, the most common symptoms reported in many studies are fatigue and dyspnoea that last for months after acute COVID-19. Other persistent symptoms may include cognitive and mental impairments, chest and joint pains, palpitations, myalgia, smell and taste dysfunctions, cough, headache, and gastrointestinal and cardiac issues. Presently, there is limited literature discussing the possible pathophysiology, risk factors, and treatments in long COVID, which the current review aims to address. In brief, long COVID may be driven by long-term tissue damage (e.g. lung, brain, and heart) and pathological inflammation (e.g. from viral persistence, immune dysregulation, and autoimmunity). The associated risk factors may include female sex, more than five early symptoms, early dyspnoea, prior psychiatric disorders, and specific biomarkers (e.g. D-dimer, CRP, and lymphocyte count), although more research is required to substantiate such risk factors. While preliminary evidence suggests that personalized rehabilitation training may help certain long COVID cases, therapeutic drugs repurposed from other similar conditions, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and mast cell activation syndrome, also hold potential.

Monthly variation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater samples may be ascribed to a decline of 19.3% in the total number of active cases in October 2020 and a rise of 1.82% in November 2020. Also, the monthly recovery rate of patients was 16.61, 19.31, and 15.58% in September, October, and Novem-ber 2020, respectively. The percentage change in the genome concentration was observed in the lead of 1-2 weeks with respect to the provisional figures of confirmed cases. SWEEP data-based city zonation was matched with the heat map of the overall COVID-19 infected population in Ahmedabad city, and month-wise effective RNA concentration variations are shown on the map. The results expound on the potential of WBE surveillance of COVID-19 as a city zonation tool that can be meaningfully interpreted, predicted, and propagated for community preparedness through advance identification of COVID-19 hotspots within a given city.","Kumar, M.; Joshi, M.; Shah, A.

Additionally, the current study identified the correlation among these problems, resilience, and demographics of participants. The study explored the main predictors of stress, depression, anxiety, and resilience. Methods: Both the descriptive cross-sectional correlational design and convenience sample technique were used to collect data from active Jordanian HCWs who directly deal with patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 and work at healthcare facilities in Jordan. Data were collected by using online questionnaires about the demographics, stress, anxiety, depression, and resilience of the participants. Results: Data were collected from 225 HCWs. Their mean age was 31.17 years (SD = 6.8). All the participants perceived different levels of stress, with most perceiving exposure to a high level of stress (distress) (46.2% with low level and 53.8% with high level of stress); approximately half of them (52.9%; n = 119) reported a high level of anxiety, and more than half (66.2%; n = 149) had a high level of depression. Additionally, an increased anxiety and depression level was significantly associated with the decreased resilience and increased stress level. Increased age and experience of HCWs are significantly correlated with increased stress levels. The participants having personal protection equipment (PPE) reduced anxiety and depression and increased resilience (p > 0.05). The predictors of the main variables were varied in the study. Conclusion: Frontline HCWs involved in treating the patients with COVID-19 are liable to have a high level of stress that is associated with increased anxiety and depression levels. These high levels affect their mental well-being and resilience. Healthcare institutions in Jordan must tailor appropriate psychological interventions and support that are congruent with the needs of HCWs during and after caring for patients with COVID-19.","Alhalaiqa, Fadwa Naji; Khalifeh, Anas H.; Al Omari, Omar; Yehia, Dalal Bashier; Khalil, Malek Mohammad Hassan",Front Psychol,278,22

In the present study, 31 pig farms with outbreaks of neonatal diarrhea were investigated in Catalonia (NE Spain) from February 2017 until June 2018. Two hundred and fifteen diarrheic samples from 1 to 7 days old piglets were tested for a panel of enteric pathogens. In 19 of the studied farms additional fecal samples from apparently healthy pen-mates were collected and tested for the same panel of infectious agents. Samples were bacteriologically cultured and tested by PCR for E. coli virulence factors genes, C. perfringens types A and C toxins (Cpα, Cpβ, Cpβ2) and C. difficile toxins (TcdA, TcdB). Moreover, Rotavirus A (RVA), Rotavirus B (RVB), Rotavirus C (RVC), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were also determined by RT-qPCR. More than one pathogen could be detected in all of the outbreaks. Nevertheless, RVA was the only agent that could be statistically correlated with the outcome of diarrhea. For the other viruses and bacteria analyzed significant differences between the diseased pigs and the controls were not found. In spite of this, the individual analysis of each of the studied farms indicated that other agents such as RVB, RVC, toxigenic C. difficile or pathogenic E. coli could play a relevant role in the outbreak of diarrhea. In conclusion, the large diversity of agent combinations and disease situations detected in neonatal diarrhea outbreaks of this study stand for a more personalized diagnosis and management advice at a farm level.","Vidal, Anna; Martín-Valls, Gerard E.; Tello, Montse; Mateu, Enric; Martín, Marga; Darwich, Laila",Vet Microbiol,278,26

We aimed to (1) quantify the attack rate of Sars-CoV-2 during outbreaks in reception and accommodation centres in Germany, (2) assess differences in the attack rate based on containment measures, and (3) provide an overview of testing strategies, communication, conflicts, and protection measures for refugees with special needs. Methods Systematic web-based review of outbreak media reports (until June 2020) on confirmed Sars-CoV-2 cases in reception centers for asylum seekers in Germany using the google search engine. Reports were screened for pre-defined inclusion criteria and complemented by snowball searches. Data on facility name, location, confirmed cases, containment measures, communication, protection strategies, and conflicts was extracted for each outbreak and reporting date. Evidence synthesis: meta-analysis and negative binomial regression. Findings We identified 337 media reports on 101 Sars-CoV-2 outbreaks in 99 reception and accommodation centers in Germany. The pooled Sars-CoV-2 attack rate was 13.1% (95% confidence interval, CI: 9.8- 16.7). Outbreak sites implementing mass quarantine (n=76) showed higher rates (15.7; 95% CI: 11.6 - 20.2) compared to sites using conventional strategies (6.6; 95%CI: 3.1 - 11.2), yielding a rate ratio of 0.44 (95%CI: 0.27-0.72) adjusted for testing strategies, type and size of accommodation. Conflicts occurred in at least 11.8% of all outbreaks. Few sites reported specific measures to protect refugees with special needs. Conclusion Mass quarantine is associated with higher attack rates, and appears to be a counter-productive containment measure in overcrowded camps. Although further research with individual-level data is required to rule out residual confounding, reception centers and refugee camps should follow the available guidelines on Covid-19 response and refrain from mass quarantine if physical distancing cannot be guaranteed.","Jahn, R.; Hintermeier, M.; Bozorgmehr, K.",,278,28

An image-based eyelid lesion management service was piloted to reduce the number of patients who would require outpatient clinic review. The aim of this study was to determine its accuracy and feasibility, both as a hospital-based and community optometrist-based service. If successful, the service was envisaged to significantly reduce the number of patients that require face-to-face (F2F) review, in accordance with current post-COVID-19 principles of social distancing. METHODS: Patients with lid lesions attending an oculoplastics clinic were assessed by consultant oculoplastic surgeons in an F2F consultation (Arm A). The lesions were photographed by a professional clinical photographer (Arm B) and by an optometrist with a handheld digital camera (Arm C). These images were reviewed by independent consultants masked to the outcome of the F2F clinical encounter. Data were collected prospectively including patient demographics, diagnosis, suspicion of malignancy and management. The image-based clinic results were compared to the F2F clinic results. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were included. Clinical diagnoses were compared for intra-observer variability and substantial agreement was demonstrated between gold-standard F2F clinic visit (Arm A) and Arm B (Ƙ = 0.708) and C (Ƙ = 0.776). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of discharge and all cases of malignancy were either identified or flagged for F2F review in the image-based arms. CONCLUSION: This pilot demonstrated substantial diagnostic agreement of image-based diagnoses with F2F consultation and image review alone did not miss any cases of malignancy.","Hind, J.; Edington, M.; McFall, K.; Salina, E.; Diaper, C.; Drummond, S.; Tejwani, D.; Gregory, M.

In the absence of vaccines and effective therapeutical solutions, non-pharmaceutic intervention has become a major way for controlling the epidemic. Gentle mitigation interventions are able to slow down the epidemic but not to halt it well. While strict suppression interventions are efficient for controlling the epidemic, long-term measures are likely to have negative impacts on economics and people’s daily live. Hence, dynamically balancing suppression and mitigation interventions plays a fundamental role in manipulating the epidemic curve. METHODS: We collected data of the number of infections for several countries during the COVID-19 pandemics and found a clear phenomenon of periodic waves of infection. Based on the observation, by connecting the infection level with the medical resources and a tolerance parameter, we propose a mathematical model to understand impacts of combining intervention measures on the epidemic dynamics. RESULTS: Depending on the parameters of the medical resources, tolerance level, and the starting time of interventions, the combined intervention measure dynamically changes with the infection level, resulting in a periodic wave of infections controlled below an accepted level. The study reveals that, (a) with an immediate, strict suppression, the numbers of infections and deaths are well controlled with a significant reduction in a very short time period; (b) an appropriate, dynamical combination of suppression and mitigation may find a feasible way in reducing the impacts of epidemic on people’s live and economics. CONCLUSIONS: While the assumption of interventions deployed with a cycle of period in the model is limited and unrealistic, the phenomenon of periodic waves of infections in reality is captured by our model. These results provide helpful insights for policy-makers to dynamically deploy an appropriate intervention strategy to effectively battle against the COVID-19.","Han, Yuexing; Xie, Zeyang; Guo, Yike; Wang, Bing",BMC Public Health,278,16

Case Report,14.377255,12.210884,2020-08-31,"Schistosomes infect about 250 million people globally causing the devastating and persistent disease of schistosomiasis. These blood flukes have a complicated life cycle involving alternating infection of freshwater snail intermediate and definitive mammalian hosts. To survive and flourish in these diverse environments, schistosomes transition through a number of distinct life-cycle stages as a result of which they change their body plan in order to quickly adapt to each new environment. Current research suggests that stem cells, present in adults and larvae, are key in aiding schistosomes to facilitate these changes. Given the recent advances in our understanding of schistosome stem cell biology, we review the key roles that two major classes of cells play in the different life cycle stages during intramolluscan and intramammalian development; these include the germinal cells of sporocysts involved in asexual reproduction in molluscan hosts and the neoblasts of adult worms involved in sexual reproduction in human and other mammalian hosts. These studies shed considerable new light in revealing the stem cell heterogeneity driving the propagation of the schistosome life cycle. We also consider the possibility and value of establishing stem cell lines in schistosomes to advance schistosomiasis research. The availability of such self-renewable resources will provide new platforms to study stem cell behavior and regulation, and to address fundamental aspects of schistosome biology, reproductive development and survival. In turn, such studies will create new avenues to unravel individual gene function and to optimize genome-editing processes in blood flukes, which may lead to the design of novel intervention strategies for schistosomiasis.","You, Hong; Jones, Malcolm K.; Whitworth, Deanne J.; McManus, Donald P.",Front Immunol,278,16

FIT invitations were resumed on June 3. In this study, we describe the short-term effects of this suspension on a myriad of relevant screening outcomes. As a result of the suspension, a quarter of the individuals due for screening between March and November 2020 had not received their invitation for FIT screening by November 30, 2020. Furthermore, 57.8% of those who received a consecutive FIT between the restart and November 30, 2020, received it outside the upper limit of the standard screening interval (26 months). Median time between positive FIT and colonoscopy did not change as a result of the pandemic. Participation rates of FIT screening and follow-up colonoscopy in the months just before and during the suspension were significantly lower than expected, but returned to normal levels after the suspension. Based on the anticipated 2020 cohort size, we estimate that the number of individuals with advanced neoplasia currently detected up until November 2020 was 31.2% lower compared to what would have been expected without a pandemic.

Neutrophils can be activated by a multitude of stimuli and the current dogma states that this is a two-step process, consisting of a priming step followed by an activation step. Considering that neutrophil activation occurs in an inflammatory environment, where multiple stimuli are present, we argue that a two-step process is highly unlikely. Here, we indeed demonstrate that neutrophils require simultaneous ligation of two different receptors for efficient activation. We isolated human peripheral blood neutrophils and cultured them with various combinations of stimuli (GM-CSF, fMLF, TNF, and LPS). Next, we evaluated essential neutrophil functions, including degranulation and ROS production using flow cytometry, mediator release using ELISA, NETosis by a live cell imaging method, phagocytosis by imaging flow cytometry, and extracellular vesicle (EV) release quantified by high-resolution flow cytometry. Exposure of neutrophils to any combination of stimuli, but not to single stimuli, resulted in significant degranulation, and mediator and EV release. Furthermore, ROS production increased substantially by dual stimulation, yet appeared to be more dependent on the type of stimulation than on dual stimulation. Phagocytosis was induced to its maximum capacity by a single stimulus, while NETosis was not induced by any of the used physiological stimuli. Our data indicate that neutrophil activation is tightly regulated and requires activation by two simultaneous stimuli, which is largely independent of the combination of stimuli.","Mol, Sanne; Hafkamp, Florianne M.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mental health using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for total difficulties and externalizing and internalizing symptoms. RESULTS: Among the 1000 children included in the analysis (mean [SD] age, 10.8 [3.5] years; 517 [52.6%] boys; 293 [31.6%] American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, or Black individuals or individuals of other race; and 233 [27.8%] Hispanic/Latino individuals), 195 (20.9%) reported at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day. Children reported a mean (SD) of 3.9 (2.2) d/wk with at least 60 minutes of physical activity and 4.4 (2.5) h/d of recreational screen time. COVID-19 stressors were significantly associated with higher total difficulties for both younger (β coefficient, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9) and older (β coefficient, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.0-0.7) groups. After accounting for COVID-19 stressors, engaging in 7 d/wk (vs 0) of physical activity was associated with fewer externalizing symptoms in younger children (β coefficient, −2.0; 95% CI, −3.4 to −0.6). For older children, engaging in 1 to 6 and 7 d/wk (vs 0) of physical activity was associated with lower total difficulties (β coefficients, −3.5 [95% CI, −5.3 to −1.8] and −3.6 [95% CI, −5.8 to −1.4], respectively), fewer externalizing symptoms (β coefficients, −1.5 [95% CI, −2.5 to −0.4] and −1.3 [95% CI, −2.6 to 0], respectively), and fewer internalizing symptoms (β coefficients, −2.1 [95% CI, −3.0 to −1.1] and −2.3 [95% CI, −3.5 to −1.1], respectively). More screen time was correlated with higher total difficulties among younger (β coefficient, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.5) and older (β coefficient, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.6) children. There were no significant differences by sex. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional survey study, more physical activity and less screen time were associated with better mental health for children, accounting for pandemic stressors. Children engaged in suboptimal amounts of physical activity and screen time, making this a potentially important target for intervention.","Tandon, Pooja S.; Zhou, Chuan; Johnson, Ashleigh M.; Gonzalez, Erin Schoenfelder; Kroshus, Emily",JAMA Netw Open,278,20

Some physicians have chosen to use elastomeric face masks (EFMs), traditionally used in non-healthcare industries. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of Emergency Medicine (EM) physicians working at a Level 1 Trauma Center who chose to use self-supplied EFMs for PPE. All subjects used commercial EFMs with disposable filters (N95, P95, or P100). All subjects chose their mask size independently with no input from employee health regarding appropriate fit. Per study protocol, subjects were fit tested periodically during clinical shifts over the course of the 6-week study period. All investigators performing fit testing underwent OSHA qualitative fit testing training. Data collected included mask/filters age, subjective assessment of mask seal quality, and fit test results. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 105 fit tests were performed on physicians wearing EFMs over the course of 49 shifts. Physicians felt their fit was adequate for all tests performed. There were no fit test failures in any subjects. CONCLUSIONS: EFMs have an extremely low failure rate. Physicians are able to assess the adequacy of fit and accurately choose EFM size.","McMahon, Kathleen; Jeanmonod, Donald; Check, Ronald; Rivard, Leah; Balakrishnan, Vamsi; Kelly, Brian; Pester, Jonathan; Jeanmonod, Rebecca",Am J Emerg Med,278,20

Here, with a predicted peptide library from SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins, restricted to three of the most prominent HLA-A alleles in the Asian population, we found that specific CD8+ T cell responses were identified in over 75% of COVID-19 convalescent patients (15/20). A total of 15 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes from the S and N proteins were identified, and among them, 3 dominant epitopes were further characterized. We found that an epitope from the N protein, N361-369 (KTFPPTEPK), was the most dominant epitope from our selected peptide library. Importantly, we discovered 2 N361-369-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) with high functional avidity that were independent of the CD8 co-receptor. These TCRs exhibited complementary cross-reactivity to several presently reported N361-369 mutant variants, as to the wild-type epitope. Further, the natural functions of these TCRs in the cytotoxic immunity against SARS-CoV-2 were determined with dendritic cells (DCs) and the lung organoid model. We found that the N361-369 epitope could be normally processed and endogenously presented by these different types of antigen presenting cells, to elicit successful activation and effective cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells ex vivo. Our study evidenced potential mechanisms of cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and illuminated potential ways of viral clearance in COVID-19 patients. These results indicate that utilizing CD8-independent TCRs against SARS-CoV-2-associated antigens may provide functional superiority that is beneficial for the adoptive cell immunotherapies based on natural or genetically engineered T cells. Additionally, this information is highly relevant for the development of the next-generation vaccines with protections against continuously emerged SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains.","Hu, Chao; Shen, Meiying; Han, Xiaojian; Chen, Qian; Li, Luo; Chen, Siyin; Zhang, Jing; Gao, Fengxia; Wang, Wang; Wang, Yingming; Li, Tingting; Li, Shenglong; Huang, Jingjing; Wang, Jianwei; Zhu, Ju; Chen, Dan; Wu, Qingchen; Tao, Kun; Pang, Da; Jin, Aishun",Genes Dis,278,20

Moreover, the need for teaching professionalism has a mutual relationship with the formation of a desirable professional identity. AIM: The current study aimed at developing a professionalism manual for the nurse managers to improve their perception regarding professionalism and professional identity. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental research design with pre-test, post-test, and follow-up was used. SETTING: The study was conducted at two different hospitals; Menoufia University hospital and Al-helal Insurance hospital, Menoufia Governorate, Egypt. SUBJECTS: The participants included all nurse managers at different levels from the two different hospitals (n =100). Tools: tool 1: Professionalism Questionnaire and tool 2: Professional Identity Assessment Questionnaire were used to collect data. RESULTS: there was a statistically significant improvement in professionalism perception and professional identity level immediately after administering the professionalism manual and after three months in the follow-up phase than the pre-test phase. Additionally, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between two variables of the study at the post and follow-up phases, but not significant at the pre-test phase. CONCLUSION: the professionalism manual was effective in improving nurse managers’ perceptions regarding professionalism and professional identity. Recommendations: Incorporate the attributes of professionalism that were included in the professionalism manual as a guide for the performance review processes of nurses.","Ageiz, Marwa H.; Elshrief, Hayam A.; Bakeer, Huda M.",SAGE Open Nurs,278,16
