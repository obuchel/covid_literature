From a contemporary vantage, lower respiratory tract infections are the greatest cause of infection-related mortality in the United States, and rank seventh among all causes of deaths in the United States.2,3 From a global and historic perspective, the scope and scale of lower respiratory tract infection is greater than any other infectious syndrome, and viral pneumonias have proven to be some of the most lethal and dramatic of human diseases. The 1918–1919 influenza pandemic, perhaps the most devastating infectious disease pandemic in recorded history, resulted in an estimated 40 million deaths worldwide, including 700,000 deaths in the U.S.4 The global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during 2003, although considerably smaller in scale, resulted in 8098 cases and 774 deaths5 and is a dramatic contemporary example of the ability of viral pneumonias to rapidly disseminate and cause severe disease in human populations.","Zaki, Sherif R.; Paddock, Christopher D.",Dail and Hammar&#x02019;s Pulmonary Pathology,742,1

In the weeks before and months following lockdown, including when it was not being enforced, citizens were advised to stay at home where possible. As a result, in a megacity such as London, where long-distance commuting is common, spatial and temporal changes to patterns of water demand are inevitable. This, in turn, may change where people's waste is treated and ultimately impact the in-river quality of effluent receiving waters. To assess large scale impacts, such as COVID-19, at the city scale, an integrated modelling approach that captures everything between households and rivers is needed. A framework to achieve this is presented in this study and used to explore changes in water use and the associated impacts on wastewater treatment and in-river quality as a result of government and societal responses to COVID-19. Our modelling results revealed significant changes to household water consumption under a range of impact scenarios, however, they only showed significant impacts on pollutant concentrations in household wastewater in central London. Pollutant concentrations in rivers simulated by the model were most sensitive in the tributaries of the River Thames, highlighting the vulnerability of smaller rivers and the important role that they play in diluting pollution. Modelled ammonia and phosphates were found to be the pollutants that rivers were most sensitive to because their main source in urban rivers is domestic wastewater that was significantly altered during the imposed mobility restrictions. A model evaluation showed that we can accurately validate individual model components (i.e., water demand generator) and emphasised need for continuous water quality measurements. Ultimatly, the work provides a basis for further developments of water systems integration approaches to project changes under never-before seen scenarios.","Dobson, B.; Jovanovic, T.; Chen, Y.

Automated annotation and classification of the vast amounts of generated sequence data has become paramount for facilitating biological sciences. Genomes of viruses can be radically different from all life, both in terms of molecular structure and primary sequence. Alignment-based and profile-based searches are commonly employed for characterization of assembled viral contigs from high-throughput sequencing data. Recent attempts have highlighted the use of machine learning models for the task but these models rely entirely on DNA genomes and owing to the intrinsic genomic complexity of viruses, RNA viruses have gone completely overlooked. Here, we present a novel short k-mer based sequence scoring method that generates robust sequence information for training machine learning classifiers. We trained 18 classifiers for the task of distinguishing viral RNA from human transcripts. We challenged our models with very stringent testing protocols across different species and evaluated performance against BLASTn, BLASTx and HMMER3 searches. For clean sequence data retrieved from curated databases, our models display near perfect accuracy, outperforming all similar attempts previously reported. On de-novo assemblies of raw RNA-Seq data from cells subjected to Ebola virus, the area under the ROC curve varied from 0.6 to 0.86 depending on the software used for assembly. Our classifier was able to properly classify the majority of the false hits generated by BLAST and HMMER3 searches on the same data. The outstanding performance metrics of our model lays the groundwork for robust machine learning methods for the automated annotation of sequence data. Author Summary In this age of high-throughput sequencing, proper classification of copious amounts of sequence data remains to be a daunting challenge. Presently, sequence alignment methods are immediately assigned to the task. Owing to the selection forces of nature, there is considerable homology even between the sequences of different species which draws ambiguity to the results of alignment-based searches. Machine Learning methods are becoming more reliable for characterizing sequence data, but virus genomes are more variable than all forms of life and viruses with RNA-based genomes have gone overlooked in previous machine learning attempts. We designed a novel short k-mer based scoring criteria whereby a large number of highly robust numerical feature sets can be derived from sequence data. These features were able to accurately distinguish virus RNA from human transcripts with performance scores better than all previous reports. Our models were able to generalize well to distant species of viruses and mouse transcripts. The model correctly classifies the majority of false hits generated by current standard alignment tools. These findings strongly imply that this k-mer score based computational pipeline forges a highly informative, rich set of numerical machine learning features and similar pipelines can greatly advance the field of computational biology.","Alam, Md.

Methods: We drew data from the National Cancer Institute's 2020 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS). We described and compared the characteristics of social determinants of health, physical activity, mental health, alcohol use, patterns of social networking service use, and health information data sharing. Analyses were weighted to provide nationally representative estimates. Multivariate models (multiple linear regression, multiple logistic regression, and multinomial logistic model) were used to assess the sole and joint effect of sex and pandemic. In addition, we applied the Bonferroni correction to adjust p-values to decrease the risks of type I errors when making multiple statistical tests. Results: Women are more likely to use mobile health and health communication technologies. The effect of sex after the COVID-19 pandemic is significant on mental health, and women are more possible to have depression or anxiety disorders. The effect of sex is also significant before and after the pandemic regarding seeking health or medical information. Women have a smaller quantity and intensity of physical activity, which has a negative effect on health. Conclusion: Gender differences exist regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic and the pandemic amplifies the differences in some health and health care domains. Intersectional gender analyses are integral to addressing issues that arise and mitigating the exacerbation of inequities. Responses to the pandemic should consider diverse perspectives, including sex and gender.","Ye, J.; Ren, Z.",,742,20

Here, we examine how socio-economic and climate drivers affect the early growth rates of COVID-19 in China and the other countries, the former of which have consistently stricter quarantine during early epidemic and thus are used to enquire the influences of human interventions on trainsimissions. We find that the early growth rates of COVID-19 are higher in China than the other countries, which is consistent with previous reports. The global spread is mainly driven by the socio-economic factors such as GDP per capita, human movement and population density rather than climate. Among socio-economic factors, GDP per capita is most important showing negative relationships in China, while positive in the other countries. However, the predicability of early growth rates by socio-economic and climate variables is at least 1.6 times higher in China's provinces than the other countries, which is further supported by metapopulation network model. These findings collectively indicate that the stochasticity of transimission processes decrease upon strict quarantine measures such as travel restrictions.","Liu, Z.",,742,16

Methods for this work include analysis of secondary data and twenty-two semi-structured interviews with various actors knowledgeable about refugee resettlement and/or agricultural production in Colorado. We argue various intersecting geopolitical processes—from immigration raids of meatpacking plants to presidential-level xenophobic discourses and ensuing immigration policies—interact to impact refugee resettlement and participation in the meat production sector. Moreover, while the U.S.’s neoliberal model of outsourcing resettlement to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) has been widely critiqued, we argue NGO employees, many of whom identify as foreign-born and/or refugees, work to build connection and belonging among refugees in challenging resettlement environments.

Yet, in remote rural areas, higher-level facilities offering parenteral antimalarials are often difficult to access. A randomised controlled trial found pre-referral rectal artesunate (RAS) to reduce death and disability in children who delay arriving at a referral facility. This study examined the effectiveness of pre-referral RAS treatment in established community-based health care systems. Methods An observational study accompanied the roll-out of RAS in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria and Uganda. Children < 5 years presenting to a community-based health provider with a positive malaria test and signs of severe malaria were followed-up during admission and after 28 days to assess their health status and treatment history. The primary outcome was death; covariates of interest included RAS use, referral completion, and post-referral treatment. Findings Post-roll-out, RAS was administered to 88% of patients in DRC, 52% in Nigeria, and 70% in Uganda. The overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 6.7% (135/2011) in DRC, 11.7% (69/589) in Nigeria, and 0.5% (19/3686) in Uganda; 865/6286 patients were sick at follow-up. In all countries, the CFR was higher after RAS-roll-out (6.7 vs. 6.6% in DRC, 16.1 vs. 4.2% in Nigeria, 0.7 vs. 0.3% in Uganda). In DRC and Nigeria, children receiving RAS were more likely to die than those not receiving RAS (aOR = 3.31, 95% CI 1.43-7.65 and aOR = 2.42, 95% CI 1.25-4.70, respectively). In Uganda, RAS users were less likely to be dead or sick at follow-up (aOR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.46-0.80). Post-referral parenteral antimalarials were protective in all countries; however, the effect of ACT administration was inconsistent. Interpretation RAS pre-referral treatment had no beneficial effect on child survival in three highly malaria endemic settings. RAS is unlikely to reduce malaria deaths unless health system shortfalls such as referral and post-referral treatment are addressed.","Hetzel, M.

The reality of reduced working hours set in, and a contraction in consumer demand and business confidence began, leading to a reduction in spending and investment. Travel restrictions were put in place, trade was halted, and most of the way we were used to living changed drastically. To combat economic losses and complete economic shutdown, governments were forced to rollout relief policies to aid businesses and reduce financial losses. These policies include tax and bank payment holidays, underwriting of loans, job retention schemes, value-added tax (VAT) deferments, grants, and mortgage breaks. This study aimed to analyse the support policies that several European countries applied to assist businesses and compare them to South Africa. The study followed a qualitative exploratory research design using secondary data obtained from several open-source documents obtained from various government and non-governmental websites. Thematic analysis using Atlas.ti was used to analyse and report the data. Five themes emanated from the study: Business stability measures, Social support, Post-Covid recovery measures, Liquidity measures for businesses and Transmission prevention.

Biodiversity problems are global, and associated governance issues range beyond geographical and spatial boundaries. The globalisation and internationalisation of biodiversity concerns have resulted in the emergence of biodiversity legal frameworks designed to conserve and sustainably use our planet's biological resources. As an ""organic and evolving discipline,"" biodiversity laws are increasingly important and affect the Earth's natural systems that support human life. The article analyses the judicial space that makes, interprets and enforces laws that conserve and support the sustainable use of biodiversity. The proactive, creative judiciary, acting as amicus environment, has produced a major shift in the Indian environmental landscape. The use of public interest litigation (PIL) in both environmental and biodiversity matters is welcomed by the senior judiciary (Supreme Court and High Courts) and also by the specialised environmental tribunal, National Green Tribunal (NGT). The terminological reach of the popular descriptive words, environment, nature and ecology, on occasions including biodiversity, introduced matters litigated in the courts and tribunal. The combination of legal, scientific, and technical expertise in the three judicial fora recognize and consider conservation and protection of biodiversity as an inextricable part of life. The article follows the chronological path of biodiversity litigation, i.e. pre 1992-2002;then 2002-2010 and finally 2010-2020 and examines significant aspects of the three decades of biodiversity litigation.","Gill, G.

There was a reported increase in the incidence of new-onset type 1 paediatric diabetes in the pandemic and concerns that the incidence was related to an infection or a dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2.Studies have also reported concerns about delayed presentations to the Emergency Department (ED) due to parental fears of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in an increase in the incidence and severity of diabetic ketoacidosis in children with new-onset diabetes.If it is proven that the perceived increased incidence of paediatric diabetes is related to an infection with SARS-CoV-2, this has implications for enhancing public and clinician awareness of diabetes resulting in early recognition and prevention of DKA.ObjectivesTo characterise the features of children diagnosed with new onset type 1 diabetes in the COVID -19 pandemic exploring the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and investigating any association with SARS-CoV-2.MethodsWe analysed data of new onset type 1 diabetes in children aged 6 months-17 years presenting from January to July 2020 to 12 paediatric diabetes units (PDUs) in the UK. Data from the same time period in 2019 was compiled for comparison.We compared the characteristics of 178 children presenting with new-onset type 1 diabetes between January and July 2020 (time period of interest) with those of 150 children who presented during the same period in 2019.ResultsThere was a statistically significant increase in the number of children with new-onset type 1 diabetes presenting with DKA in 2020 when compared to 2019 (79 versus 49, p <0.05). There was also an increase in the number of children presenting in severe DKA in 2020 when compared to 2019 (36 versus 16). The incidence of new onset type 1 diabetes from January to July 2020 was similar to the previous 4 years. An apparent increase in 2020 was noted in two units, who were both from inner city localities with a highly diverse ethnic mix. Association with COVID-19 could not be ascertained from the children tested for SARS-CoV-2 by NPA RT PCR and serology.In 2019 35% of children had symptoms of less than 2 weeks (of which 43% were in DKA),46% of children in 2020 presented with symptoms less than 2 weeks (of which 48% were in DKA). The short period of type 1 diabetes symptoms before presenting in DKA in 2020 does not suggest a delay in diagnosis.The short period of symptoms of type 1 diabetes at presentation during the study period and the severity of DKA raises the possibility that infection with SARS-CoV–2 may have been a trigger resulting in a rapid loss of β-cells contributing to the rise in incidence and severity of DKA also accelerating the development of new-onset diabetes.ConclusionsThere was increased incidence and severity of DKA during the study period in 2020.Our study did not provide evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic is leading to a marked increase in incidence of pediatric type 1 diabetes.","Ponmani, Caroline Sakka Sophia Wickramarachchi Chandu Ajzensztejn Michal Shankar Kanumakala Redpath Yvette Hulse Tony Koshy Sherin",Archives of Disease in Childhood,742,28

Alongside this, however, vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis has emerged. Recently, a new recombinant virus (Enterovirus C/Poliovirus) was identified in humans working as eco-guards and in gorillas in Democratic Republic of Congo, including one gorilla with polio-like sequelae. A strain of this recombinant virus (Ibou002) was also isolated from gorilla faeces. In order to assess the potential role of poliovirus infection, we have developed and optimised a protocol, based on the lyophilisation and solubilisation of small volumes of stool extracts, to detect specific antibodies. First, total immunoglobulins was detected in the concentrated stool extracts. Specific antibodies were then detected in 4/16 gorilla samples and 2/3 human samples by western blot using both the polio vaccine antigen and the Ibou002 antigen and by ELISA using the polio vaccine antigen. Humoral responses were greater with the Ibou002 antigen. We therefore suggest that this recombinant virus could lead to a polio-like disease in the endangered western lowland gorilla. The development of a non-invasive method to detect microorganism-specific immunoglobulins from faecal samples opens up new perspectives for the exploration of humoral responses of pathogens in animals and a greater understanding of zoonotic infectious diseases.","Sereme, Youssouf; Zarza, Sandra Madariaga; Medkour, Hacène; Amona, Inestin; Fenollar, Florence; Akiana, Jean; Mezouar, Soraya; Orain, Nicolas; Vitte, Joana; Davoust, Bernard; Raoult, Didier; Mediannikov, Oleg",bioRxiv,742,1

We describe quantitative trait analysis of plant height and flowering time in the naturally occurring tetraploid Sorghum halepense, using two novel BC1F2 populations totaling 246 genotypes derived from backcrossing two tetraploid Sorghum bicolor x S. halepense F1 plants to a tetraploidized S. bicolor. Phenotyping for two years each in Bogart, GA and Salina, KS allowed us to dissect variance into narrow-sense genetic (QTLs) and environmental components. In crosses with a common S. bicolor BTx623 parent, comparison of QTLs in S. halepense, its rhizomatous progenitor S. propinquum and S. bicolor race guinea which is highly divergent from BTx623 permit inferences of loci at which new alleles have been associated with improvement of elite sorghums. The relative abundance of QTLs unique to the S. halepense populations may reflect its polyploidy and subsequent 'diploidization' processes often associated with the formation of genetic novelty, a possibility further supported by a high level of QTL polymorphism within sibling lines derived from a common S. halepense parent. An intriguing hypothesis for further investigation is that polyploidy of S. halepense following 96 million years of abstinence, coupled with natural selection during its spread to diverse environments across six continents, may provide a rich collection of novel alleles that offer potential opportunities for sorghum improvement.","Kong, WenQian; Nabukalu, Pheonah; Cox, T S; Goff, Valorie H; Robertson, Jon S; Pierce, Gary J; Lemke, Cornelia; Compton, Rosana; Paterson, Andrew H",Theor. appl. genet,742,13

Due to the substantial case fatality rates within congregate settings, federal agencies recommended restrictions to family visits. Six months into the COVID-19 pandemic, these largely remain in place. The objective of this study was to generate consensus guidance statements focusing on essential family caregivers and visitors. DESIGN: A modified 2-step Delphi process was used to generate consensus statements. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The Delphi panel consisted of 21 US and Canadian post-acute and long-term care experts in clinical medicine, administration, and patient care advocacy. METHODS: State and federal reopening statements were collected in June 2020 and the panel voted on these using a 3-point Likert scale with consensus defined as &#8805;80% of panel members voting ""Agree."" The consensus statements then informed development of the visitor guidance statements. RESULTS: The Delphi process yielded 77 consensus statements. Regarding visitor guidance, the panel made 5 strong recommendations: (1) maintain strong infection prevention and control precautions, (2) facilitate indoor and outdoor visits, (3) allow limited physical contact with appropriate precautions, (4) assess individual residents' care preferences and level of risk tolerance, and (5) dedicate an essential caregiver and extend the definition of compassionate care visits to include care that promotes psychosocial well-being of residents. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has seen substantial regulatory changes without strong consideration of the impact on residents. In the absence of timely and rigorous research, the involvement of clinicians and patient care advocates is important to help create the balance between individual resident preferences and the health of the collective. The results of this evidence-based Delphi process will help guide policy decisions as well as inform future research.","Bergman, Christian; Stall, Nathan M; Haimowitz, Daniel; Aronson, Louise; Lynn, Joanne; Steinberg, Karl; Wasserman, Michael",J Am Med Dir Assoc,742,1

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2020. Participants were recruited by an Internet-based survey company. A total of 659 patients (54% male, average age 60 ± 14 years) who had regularly scheduled outpatient visits prior to the onset of COVID-19 were enrolled. Participants answered four questions (""decrease in medical visit frequency,"" ""inability to take regular medication,"" ""deterioration of a chronic disease,"" and ""utilization of telephone/online medical care"") and stated whether they had a fear of acquiring infection at a medical facility. The associations between answers, fear of infection, and socio-demographic factors were examined. Results: Among the participants, 37.8% had decreased their medical visits, 6.8% were unable to take regular medications, 5.6% experienced a deterioration of chronic disease, and 9.1% utilized telephone/online medical care. Fear of being infected by COVID-19 at medical facilities was strongly associated with a reduced frequency of medical visits and lack of regular medications even after adjusting for socio-demographic factors and current medical histories. Conclusions: During the first wave of COVID-19, approximately 40% of participants reduced their frequency of medical visits. It is important to continue implementing thorough infection control measures at facilities and educating the public the importance of keeping chronic diseases in good condition, as well as promoting telephone/online medical care.","Takakubo, Takeshi; Odagiri, Yuko; Machida, Masaki; Takamiya, Tomoko; Fukushima, Noritoshi; Kikuchi, Hiroyuki; Amagasa, Shiho; Nakamura, Itaru; Watanabe, Hidehiro; Inoue, Shigeru",,742,2

As we consider clearance of athletes to participate in sports during the COVID-19 pandemic, we offer a brief review of the myocardial effects of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) through the lens of what is known about myocarditis and exercise. All athletes should be queried about any recent illness suspicious for COVID-19 prior to sports participation. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The PubMed database was evaluated through 2020, with the following keywords: myocarditis, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, cardiac, and athletes. Selected articles identified through the primary search, along with position statements from around the world, and the relevant references from those articles, were reviewed for pertinent clinical information regarding the identification, evaluation, risk stratification, and management of myocarditis in patients, including athletes, with and without SARS-CoV-2. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3. RESULTS: Since myocarditis can present with a variety of symptoms, and can be asymptomatic, the sports medicine physician needs to have a heightened awareness of athletes who may have had COVID-19 and be at risk for myocarditis and should have a low threshold to obtain further cardiovascular testing. Symptomatic athletes with SARS-CoV-2 may require cardiac evaluation including an electrocardiogram and possibly an echocardiogram. Athletes with cardiomyopathy may benefit from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in the recovery phase and, rarely, endocardial biopsy. CONCLUSION: Myocarditis is a known cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes. The currently reported rates of cardiac involvement of COVID-19 makes myocarditis a risk, and physicians who clear athletes for participation in sport as well as sideline personnel should be versed with the diagnosis, management, and clearance of athletes with suspected myocarditis. Given the potentially increased risk of arrhythmias, sideline personnel should practice their emergency action plans and be comfortable using an automated external defibrillator.","Raukar, Neha P; Cooper, Leslie T",Sports Health,742,6

In order to allow students to gain exposure to the field of pathology, make connections with pathologists, and provide opportunities for letters of recommendation, the authors quickly developed a Virtual Anatomic Pathology Elective at the University of Minnesota. We succeeded in developing the foundation of a Virtual Anatomic Pathology Elective that allows for the rotation to be accessible not only to our medical students but also to international medical graduates and medical students from different programs. In 1 month, we were able to create a 4-week elective that was available before the start of the 2021 residency application season. We provided students with the closest possible experience to an in-person Anatomic Pathology Elective by developing an introductory week of lectures and assignments that provided structure for the rotation, introduced the field of anatomic pathology, and demonstrated the role of pathologists in health care. Furthermore, students attended virtual resident lectures and grand rounds, participated in virtual sign-out sessions, and presented an interesting case to the faculty at the end of their rotation. The goal was ultimately to customize the curriculum to students’ interests by making the rotation applicable to those applying to pathology as well as to other specialties (eg, general surgery, internal medicine, dermatology). Overall, we were able to design and implement a novel Virtual Anatomic Pathology Elective which we know can be effectively reproduced by other medical schools. © The Author(s) 2021.","Hartsough, E.

The noble metal nanoparticles (NP) are promising materials with antiviral and antibacterial properties that can deliver the drug to the target agent, thereby reducing the side effects. In this work, we applied both the quantum mechanical and classical atomistic molecular dynamics approaches to demonstrate the adsorption properties of HCQ/CQ on Ag, Au, AgAu, and Pt nanoparticles. We found the adsorption energies of HCQ/CQ towards nanoparticles have the following trend: PtNP > AuNP > AuAgNP > AgNP.

RESULTS: Of 114 (51 % response rate) participants, 82.5 % reported negative changes in mental status measures (e.g. stress, anxious thoughts, changes in sleep patterns). All reported risk-reduction behavior changes (e.g. handwashing/use of sanitizer, social distancing). Significant changes were reported in employment and financial status due to the pandemic. Increases in alcohol consumption among postpartum women were also reported. Few reported changes in prenatal, infant or postpartum healthcare access. CONCLUSION: This study provides initial insight into the knowledge, attitudes and practices of pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is limited as participants represent a single Midwest community and social desirability response bias may have impacted responses. However, results may inform future interventions to support pregnant women and mothers of infants during pandemics. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Providers should consider the impact of such events on mental status, access to resources and changes in behaviors.","Ahlers-Schmidt, Carolyn R; Hervey, Ashley M; Neil, Tara; Kuhlmann, Stephanie; Kuhlmann, Zachary",Patient educ. couns,742,6

Here, we demonstrate that the magnitude of current-induced spin-orbit torques in thin perpendicularly magnetized CoFeB films can be tuned and even increased by electric field generated piezoelectric strain. Using theoretical calculations, we uncover that the subtle interplay of spin-orbit coupling, crystal symmetry, and orbital polarization is at the core of the observed strain dependence of spin-orbit torques. Our results open a path to integrating two energy efficient spin manipulation approaches, the electric field-induced strain and the current-induced magnetization switching, thereby enabling novel device concepts.","Filianina, Mariia; Hanke, Jan-Philipp; Lee, Kyujoon; Han, Dong-Soo; Jaiswal, Samridh; Jakob, Gerhard; Mokrousov, Yuriy; Klaui, Mathias",,742,6

Through a panel data analysis, this article identifies some of its determinants Using a specifically built index that measures the strictness of physical distancing rules in the 27 Brazilian states, this paper isolates the effect of mandatory physical distancing rules from other potential determinants of physical distancing The article concludes that physical distancing is influenced by at least three variables: the strictness of mandatory physical distancing rules, the number of confirmed cases of covid-19, and the duration of rules Evidence also indicates that the effect of physical distancing measures is relatively stronger than that of the number of cases -physical distancing is determined proportionally more by mandatory policies than people&#039;s awareness about the severity of the epidemic These results have at least two policy implications First, governments should adopt mandatory measures in order to increase physical distancing - rather than expect people to adopt them on their own Second, the timing of adopting them is important, since people are unlikely to comply with them for long periods of time Resumo Durante a pandemia de covid-19, o distanciamento físico está sendo promovido para reduzir a transmissão da doença e a pressão sobre os sistemas de saúde No entanto, o que determina o distanciamento físico?

Previously we found that 22 miRNAs appeared to predict total- and partial-body irradiation (TBI and PBI, respectively) patterns and were suggestive of the percentage of the body exposed in a baboon model. Motivated by these results, we performed a similar analysis on the transcriptional level (mRNAs) using whole genome microarrays. From 17 irradiated baboons, blood samples were taken before, and at 1, 2, 7, 28 and 75-106 days postirradiation to an equivalent TBI dose of 2.5 or 5 Gy applied either to the total body or to different parts of the body such as the upper body (UBE) or left hemibody (LHB). We compared quantile normalized log2-transformed gene expression values with three exposure pattern comparisons, namely TBI vs. PBI, TBI vs. LHB and UBE vs. LHB using Kruskal-Wallis and logistic regression analysis for receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) calculation. We found several hundred significantly (P < 0.05) and &#8805;2-fold deregulated mRNAs per exposure pattern comparison with a peak of 163-860 mRNAs at day 28. Lower numbers on day 2 (60 mRNAs) and day 7 (91-162 mRNAs) were observed, with the lowest number of deregulated mRNAs at day 75-106 (22-58 mRNAs). The 14 most promising mRNAs (e.g., LTF, DEFA3, OLFM4) appeared 10.1-46.2-fold upregulated and the exposure groups were completely or almost completely discriminated (ROC between 0.8-1.0). Several of the mRNA gene expression changes were significantly associated with the percentage of the body exposed. The numbers of overlapping genes used for diagnosis on consecutive days postirradiation were mostly 0 or less than 10. Bioinformatic analysis confirmed that at each time point different biological processes predominated. Our results suggest mRNA changes over time may be used to retrospectively determine radiation exposure patterns as partial or total body. mRNA gene expression changes likely could be applied over a longer time frame (2-75 days postirradiation) than miRNA, but due to the transient gene expression changes a different set of candidate mRNAs appears to be required at each day after irradiation.","Ostheim, P; Haupt, J; Schüle, S; Herodin, F; Valente, M; Drouet, M; Majewski, M; Port, M; Abend, M",Radiat. res,742,25

Pace current clinical practice, I argue that, under certain circumstances, these risks do need to be disclosed. Otherwise, the physician either vitiates a patient's informed consent or violates a more general obligation to warn him about potentially harmful consequences. To support this view, I argue, first, that the already widely accepted conditions in the evaluation of risks, i.e. the 'nature' and 'likelihood' of risks, speak in favour of disclosure and, second, that principled objections against the disclosure of these risks do not withstand scrutiny. Moreover, I also explain that these risks are exacerbated by pandemics like the COVID-19 crisis, which further emphasises their significance.","Kiener, Maximilian",AI Soc,742,22

METHODS: We collated and reviewed previously conducted review studies on border closures during infectious disease outbreaks to derive relevant themes and factors. RESULTS: According to our systematic review on border closures and travel restrictions, the effects of such containment efforts are limited. We suggest considering the following factors when determining whether to impose border closure measures: (1) disease characteristics, (2) timeliness of implementation, (3) transmission delay and the basic reproduction number, (4) globalization and pandemics, and (5) social and economic costs. CONCLUSIONS: Our assessment indicates that the effects of border closures are at best temporary and limited. Alternative measures must be contemplated and implemented to suppress the spread of COVID-19 in particular and infectious diseases more broadly.","Kang, SuJin; Moon, Jihyun; Kang, Heewon; Nam, Heekyoung; Tak, Sangwoo; Cho, Sung-Il",J Prev Med Public Health,742,9

Nephrolithiasis may indicate PHP with indication for parathyroidectomy. We sought to determine the proportion of patients with an index diagnosis of nephrolithiasis that have serum calcium levels measured, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels measured if hypercalcemic, and time to referral for definitive management if PHP is diagnosed. METHODS: A single-institution retrospective review was performed of adult patients presenting with nephrolithiasis between July 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018. Exclusion criteria included currently admitted patients, prior nephrolithiasis, congenital or acquired urinary tract anomalies, and patients on calciuretics. Records were assessed for serum calcium and PTH measurement, as well as referrals. Univariate statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Of 1782 patients with nephrolithiasis screened, 968 met inclusion criteria. Patients were 49.8% female, 88.9% white. Mean age was 53 y. Within this cohort, 620 (64.0%) patients had a calcium measured, with a mean elapsed time from presentation of 27 d (interquartile range [IQR] 0-8). Twelve patients (1.58%) with calcium measured were hypercalcemic and eight (66.7%) had PTH measured with a mean elapsed time from presentation of 183 d (IQR 72-310), all had elevated or non-suppressed PTH. Five (62.5%) were referred to surgeons with mean elapsed referral time of 270 d (IQR 95-492). CONCLUSIONS: Many with index nephrolithiasis are not assessed for hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism. Patients with serum calcium and PTH values indicating PHP diagnosis may have significant delay to parathyroidectomy. Targeted interventions with electronic health record alerts or automated reflex testing may improve care in this domain.","Behrens, Matthew; Boyle, Shawna; Fingeret, Abbey L",J Surg Res,742,16

IMH is distinguished from AAD by the absence of an intimal tear and flap. With short-term outcomes being similar to type B AAD, IMH is treated identically to AAD in the corresponding segment of the aorta. While all patients with any acute aortic syndrome of the descending aorta receive prompt anti-impulse therapy, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is reserved for patients presenting with certain complications, namely malperfusion, rupture, or periaortic hematoma. Technical aspects of TEVAR for IMH include maximal endograft oversizing of 10% with 20 mm landing zones of the healthy aorta, revascularization of the left subclavian artery when covered, use of cerebrospinal fluid drainage with extensive coverage, and restoration of branch vessel perfusion. With respect to disease evolution, IMH may progress to classic AD, frank rupture, or aneurysmal dilation; yet, IMH may also regress and be completely resorbed. However, since the natural history of IMH is unpredictable, TEVAR is being used more aggressively to improve long-term survival, rates of secondary reintervention, and positive aortic remodeling. Much remains unknown for acute type B IMH, including the use of prophylactic TEVAR for stable uncomplicated presentations, as well as the optimal timing of intervention and certain technical aspects of TEVAR.

The aim of the study is to present the demographic analysis of difficulties with remote learning, as perceived by students during coronavirus pandemic in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In April 2020, a nationwide online survey was conducted among adolescents aged 11-18 (N=2408). Quantitative and qualitative data were used. Teenagers were asked about the problems connected with remote learning. In order to examine the overall level of remote learning difficulties, a scale of remote learning difficulties (RLD) was devised (range 0-23 points). Differences connected with gender, age and place of residence were analysed. RESULTS: More than a half of the teenagers surveyed rated the increased demands from teachers as a major problem. This answer appeared statistically more often among girls than boys (59.6% v. 53.2%). Almost every third adolescent saw the lack of consultation (31.6%) as a significant problem. Difficulties related to learning in the remote system were most often described as considerable by the oldest students (17-18-years-old) and those living in rural areas. The big problem for them was usually much higher requirements of teachers and poor organization of distance learning. The mean level on the scale of remote learning burden was M=11.9 (SD=7.1). Technical difficulties and insufficient skills in using software constituted additional problems most frequently mentioned by students. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to pay particular attention to organizing appropriate technical conditions for remote learning, especially in rural areas, where students have complained more often than in cities about equipment and problems with access to the Internet during the pandemic.","Korzycka, Magdalena; Bójko, Martyna; Radiukiewicz, Katarzyna; Dzielska, Anna; Nalecz, Hanna; Kleszczewska, Dorota; Malkowska-Szkutnik, Agnieszka; Fijalkowska, Anna",Ann Agric Environ Med,742,1

Participants described how they encountered broad inaccessibility at early onset of the pandemic, and how advocacy efforts and complimenting their access with a wide range of sources helped fulfill their needs. By examining how BVI users interact with accessible COVID-19 data dashboards, we observed the effect of data literacy, confidence, and modality preferences on user strategies and takeaways.

To promote community-dwelling older individuals' well-being during this time, the aims of the current project are to develop effective strategies in order (a) to increase older individuals' digital literacy, and (b) to help them acquire behavioral and cognitive skills that will improve their coping abilities with the stressful situation created as a result of the pandemic, as well as reducing adverse mental health effects. The project comprises an intervention arm that includes digital group sessions for older individuals meant to improve their digital literacy, promote their effective coping, and relieve their mental distress and loneliness. Subjects receive a short-term (seven sessions), twice-weekly, digitally guided group intervention through Zoom (a video conferencing app), and WhatsApp (instant messaging app). The wait list control-group participants receive twice-weekly telephone calls from a research assistant during a parallel period. Web-based questionnaires are filled in pre- and post-participation. The effectiveness of the intervention will be analyzed by comparing pre- and post-measures, between intervention and control groups. This protocol offers a model for helping to support vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is applicable regardless of the outbreak of a global health crisis or the imposition of lockdown rules; in fact, it has the potential to contribute to the social inclusion of vulnerable populations during routine times as well as during emergencies. Furthermore, ideas for future expansion include the integration of multilingual facilitators in order to reach seniors from underserved minority groups in various social contexts, even across borders.","Shapira, Stav; Yeshua-Katz, Daphna; Goren, Ganit; Aharonson-Daniel, Limor; Clarfield, A Mark; Sarid, Orly",Front Public Health,742,16

Recent studies suggest that the population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, a proxy for the number of asymptomatic cases, could be an order of magnitude larger than expected from the number of reported symptomatic cases. Knowing the precise prevalence and contagiousness of asymptomatic transmission is critical to estimate the overall dimension and pandemic potential of COVID-19. However, at this stage, the effect of the asymptomatic population, its size, and its outbreak dynamics remain largely unknown. Here we use reported symptomatic case data in conjunction with antibody seroprevalence studies, a mathematical epidemiology model, and a Bayesian framework to infer the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Our model computes, in real time, the time-varying contact rate of the outbreak, and projects the temporal evolution and credible intervals of the effective reproduction number and the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recovered populations. Our study quantifies the sensitivity of the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 to three parameters: the effective reproduction number, the ratio between the symptomatic and asymptomatic populations, and the infectious periods of both groups. For nine distinct locations, our model estimates the fraction of the population that has been infected and recovered by Jun 15, 2020 to 24.15% (95% CI: 20.48%-28.14%) for Heinsberg (NRW, Germany), 2.40% (95% CI: 2.09%-2.76%) for Ada County (ID, USA), 46.19% (95% CI: 45.81%-46.60%) for New York City (NY, USA), 11.26% (95% CI: 7.21%-16.03%) for Santa Clara County (CA, USA), 3.09% (95% CI: 2.27%-4.03%) for Denmark, 12.35% (95% CI: 10.03%-15.18%) for Geneva Canton (Switzerland), 5.24% (95% CI: 4.84%-5.70%) for the Netherlands, 1.53% (95% CI: 0.76%-2.62%) for Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), and 5.32% (95% CI: 4.77%-5.93%) for Belgium. Our method traces the initial outbreak date in Santa Clara County back to January 20, 2020 (95% CI: December 29, 2019–February 13, 2020). Our results could significantly change our understanding and management of the COVID-19 pandemic: A large asymptomatic population will make isolation, containment, and tracing of individual cases challenging. Instead, managing community transmission through increasing population awareness, promoting physical distancing, and encouraging behavioral changes could become more relevant.","Peirlinck, Mathias; Linka, Kevin; Sahli Costabal, Francisco; Bhattacharya, Jay; Bendavid, Eran; Ioannidis, John P.A.; Kuhl, Ellen",Comput.

This incentive design problem naturally possesses a bi-level structure, in which an upper-level""designer""modifies the payoffs of the agents with incentives while anticipating the response of the agents at the lower level, who play a non-cooperative game that converges to an equilibrium. The existing bi-level optimization algorithms developed in machine learning raise a dilemma when applied to this problem: anticipating how incentives affect the agents at equilibrium requires solving the equilibrium problem repeatedly, which is computationally inefficient; bypassing the time-consuming step of equilibrium-finding can reduce the computational cost, but may lead the designer to a sub-optimal solution. To address such a dilemma, we propose a method that tackles the designer's and agents' problems simultaneously in a single loop. In particular, at each iteration, both the designer and the agents only move one step based on the first-order information. In the proposed scheme, although the designer does not solve the equilibrium problem repeatedly, it can anticipate the overall influence of the incentives on the agents, which guarantees optimality. We prove that the algorithm converges to the global optima at a sublinear rate for a broad class of games.","Liu, Boyi; Li, Jiayang; Yang, Zhuoran; Wai, Hoi-To; Hong, Mingyi; Nie, Yu Marco; Wang, Zhaoran",,742,20

Our objective was to assess stress and coping during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: During the pandemic in New York City, patients taking disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs answered open-ended questions about the pandemic's effects on daily life and their rheumatic condition. Themes of stress and coping were discerned from volunteered responses. Patients also completed the standard Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale/PROMIS Anxiety surveys. Anxiety scores were independent variables in multivariable analyses with stress and coping themes as combined dependent variables. RESULTS: Of the 112 patients interviewed (86% women; mean age, 50 years), 72 volunteered COVID-19-related stress on their rheumatic condition, home, work, and finances. Patients volunteering stress were younger, had disease longer, were taking more than 1 medication, had worse GAD-7 scores and a positive anxiety screen, and had worse PROMIS scores that were significantly worse than population norms (all comparisons, p &#8804; 0.01; all variables remained associated in multivariable analyses). Fourty-one patients volunteered coping mechanisms including support from others, engaging in activities, and resilience already establish in dealing with rheumatic diseases. Of these, 18 volunteered both coping and stress and 23 volunteered coping and no stress. Patients in the latter (coping-only) group were more likely to be older, taking only 1 medication, and had better GAD-7 and PROMIS scores (all comparisons, p &#8804; 0.02). In multivariable analysis, older age (p = 0.02) and lower GAD-7 (p = 0.03) or PROMIS scores (p = 0.03) remained associated. CONCLUSIONS: Patients reported stress and coping due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In recent years, risk scholars have increasingly focused their energies on climate change, and as pandemic coronavirus has swept the globe many of these scholars are comparing the coronavirus pandemic with climate change to inform risk management. Risk communication research and the best practices developed from it are predicated on findings from the 1970’s to the present showing that there are structural similarities in how people think about widely divergent risks. Consequently, these lessons from risk communication of climate change (and from the canon of best practices) apply to the coronavirus pandemic. In the empirical comparison of student perceptions reported here, we replicate these structural similarity findings, but also find that moral concerns in particular deserve attention as a potentially distinct dimension of risk perception, on which different risks may also differ, as pandemic risks appear to evoke less moral concern than climate change. The need for communications to be timely, honest, credible, empathetic, and informative for useful individual actions is fundamental and essential for communicating effectively about the coronavirus epidemic. Some countries have heeded risk sciences, and are coping more successfully with pandemic coronavirus. Others have failed to implement these old lessons, which our data suggest still apply. While these failures may reinforce cynicism about political and public enthusiasm for accepting science, comparisons between the coronavirus pandemic and climate change may also foster greater aspirations for collective action.","Bostrom, Ann; Böhm, Gisela; O’Connor, Robert E.; Hanss, Daniel; Bodi-Fernandez, Otto; Halder, Pradipta",J.

METHODS: All data were generated as part of routine work at Marseille university hospitals. Biological diagnoses were made by RT-PCR testing. A telephone survey of families in which a laboratory confirmed case was diagnosed was conducted to determine possible exposure events. RESULTS: As of March 30, 2020, 63 patients were linked to 6 epidemic clusters. The 6 clusters were linked to religious and social activities: a ski trip, organized meals for the Purim Jewish celebration in community and family settings on March 10, a religious service and a charity gala. Notably, 40% of the patients were infected by index patients during the presymptomatic period, which was 2.5 days before symptom onset. When considering household members, all 12 patients who tested negative and who did not develop any relevant clinical symptoms compatible with COVID-19 were 1-16 years of age. The clinical attack rate (symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and biologically confirmed by PCR) in adults was 85% compared to 26% in children. CONCLUSIONS: Family and community gatherings for the Purim Jewish celebration probably accelerated the spread of COVID-19 in the Marseille Jewish community, leading to multiple epidemic clusters. This investigation of family clusters suggested that all close contacts of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were not infected were children.","Aherfi, Sarah; Gautret, Philippe; Chaudet, Hervé; Raoult, Didier; La Scola, Bernard",Int J Infect Dis,742,1

The direct action of SARS-CoV-2 in lung cells and the dysregulated immuno-coagulative pathways activated in ARDS influence pulmonary involvement in severe COVID, that might be modulated by disease duration and individual factors. In this study we assessed the proportions of different lung pathology patterns in severe COVID-19 patients along the disease evolution and individual characteristics. METHODS: We analysed lung tissue from 41 COVID-19 patients that died in the period March-June 2020 and were submitted to a minimally invasive autopsy. Eight pulmonary regions were sampled. Pulmonary pathologists analysed the H&E stained slides, performing semiquantitative scores on the following parameters: exudative, intermediate or advanced DAD, bronchopneumonia, alveolar haemorrhage, infarct (%), arteriolar (number) or capillary thrombosis (yes/no). Histopathological data were correlated with demographic-clinical variables and periods of symptoms-hospital stay. RESULTS: Patient´s age varied from 22 to 88 years (18f/23 m), with hospital admission varying from 0 to 40 days. All patients had different proportions of DAD in their biopsies. Ninety percent of the patients presented pulmonary microthrombosis. The proportion of exudative DAD was higher in the period 0-8 days of hospital admission till death, whereas advanced DAD was higher after 17 days of hospital admission. In the group of patients that died within eight days of hospital admission, elderly patients had less proportion of the exudative pattern and increased proportions of the intermediate patterns. Obese patients had lower proportion of advanced DAD pattern in their biopsies, and lower than patients with overweight. Clustering analysis showed that patterns of vascular lesions (microthrombosis, infarction) clustered together, but not the other patterns. The vascular pattern was not influenced by demographic or clinical parameters, including time of disease progression. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe COVID-19 present different proportions of DAD patterns over time, with advanced DAD being more prevalent after 17 days, which seems to be influenced by age and weight. Vascular involvement is present in a large proportion of patients, occurs early in disease progression, and does not change over time.","Mauad, Thais; Duarte-Neto, Amaro Nunes; da Silva, Luiz Fernando Ferraz; de Oliveira, Ellen Pierre; de Brito, Jose Mara; do Nascimento, Ellen Caroline Toledo; de Almeida Monteiro, Renata Aparecida; Ferreira, Juliana Carvalho; de Carvalho, Carlos Roberto Ribeiro; do Nascimento Saldiva, Paulo Hilário; Dolhnikoff, Marisa",Respir Res,742,16

The reduction of human activities during social isolation is leading to an improvement in air quality being observed worldwide. In this study, we analysed satellite TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide) and OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) NO2 products obtained from Sentinel-5P and Aura satellites, respectively, during the social isolation from 1 April 2020 to 22 April 2020 in Vietnam where air pollution is a serious environmental issue. Both TROPOMI and OMI NO2 have shown low agreement with local on-ground NO2 concentration (the correlation coefficient r equals 0.4 and 0.3 in 2020, respectively) but have had moderate correlation with each other in 2020 (r equals 0.81 for two annual averaged maps). In addition, the moderate available data ratio over cloudy northern areas were observed, especially for TROPOMI datasets. During social isolation, the national average NO2 decreased by 9.3% for TROPOMI and 7.2% for OMI, respectively, in comparison with the same periods in the previous years. The reduction was stronger in the North than in the South and lasted for one more month after the lockdown period. The decrease of NO2 density during the lockdown was observed strongly in urban areas associated with dense population, traffic density, and industrial zones. Further analysis of NO2 density for Ho Chi Minh city revealed a decreasing trend of NO2 during social isolation (16.62% and 11.77% compared with the previous month and the same period in 2019, respectively). Furthermore, we used a random forest model to estimate the NO2 density (normal life situations) based on daily meteorological data at station. During social isolation, NO2 density observed in Ho Chi Minh city decreased by 26% down to that of normal life situations. The NO2 reduction has shown strong anthropogenic impact on air pollution over the study area.

Financial strain, personal debt, recent job loss and housing insecurity are important risk factors for the mental health of working-age adults. Community interventions have the potential to attenuate the mental health impact of these stressors. We examined the effectiveness of community interventions for protecting and promoting the mental health of working-age adults in high-income countries during periods of financial insecurity. METHODS: Eight electronic databases were systematically screened for experimental and observational studies published since 2000 measuring the effectiveness of community interventions on mental health outcomes. We included any non-clinical intervention that aimed to address the financial, employment, food or housing insecurity of participants. A review protocol was registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42019156364) and results are reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. RESULTS: From 2326 studies screened, 15 met our inclusion criteria. Five categories of community intervention were identified: advice services colocated in healthcare settings; link worker social prescribing; telephone debt advice; food insecurity interventions; and active labour market programmes. In general, the evidence for effective and cost-effective community interventions delivered to individuals experiencing financial insecurity was lacking. From the small number of studies without a high risk of bias, there was some evidence that financial insecurity and associated mental health problems were amenable to change and differences by subpopulations were observed. CONCLUSION: There is a need for well-controlled studies and trials to better understand effective ingredients and to identify those interventions warranting wider implementation.","McGrath, Michael; Duncan, Fiona; Dotsikas, Kate; Baskin, Cleo; Crosby, Liam; Gnani, Shamini; Hunter, Rachael Maree; Kaner, Eileen; Kirkbride, James Bowes; Lafortune, Louise; Lee, Caroline; Oliver, Emily; Osborn, David P; Walters, Kate R; Dykxhoorn, Jennifer",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),742,13

Historically, disease outbreaks due to pathogenic microorganisms have killed many more people than wars have, and the ability that viral genes have displayed to rapidly change and adapt has forced new studies. Early detection is most important for timely management of any biological attack, whether natural or intentional, and rapid detection systems are essential to counter the effects of viral disease. Optical sensors have several advantages in this field, such as simple and label-free protocols. In this letter, the role of layer materials, such as graphene, is presented. Graphene has unique and excellent optical properties for plasmonics and Raman scattering. Finally, a method of Covid-19 detection on graphene sensors is proposed via a plasmon-molecular orbital interaction that provides a unique signature of the S-protein of the virus.","Simone, Giuseppina",,742,24

METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational study conducted at the Spedali Civili General Hospital, in Brescia, Northern Italy during the SARS CoV-2 pandemic in the first semester of 2020. Serum samples from HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibodies. An online survey was used to collect demographic, clinical, and epidemiological data. RESULTS: Of the 1893 HCWs included, 433 (22.9%) were found seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (antibodies production or past positive RT-PCR on nasal/throat swab) was 25.1% (475/1893). Fifty-six out of 433 (13%) seropositive participants declared to have been asymptomatic during the study period.

The patients' signs and symptoms were temporally associated with COVID-19 but presumed to have developed 2-4 weeks after acute COVID-19; all children had serologic evidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1). The clinical signs and symptoms present in this first cluster included fever, rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral edema, gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, and elevated markers of inflammation and cardiac damage (1). On May 14, 2020, CDC published an online Health Advisory that summarized the manifestations of reported multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), outlined a case definition, and asked clinicians to report suspected U.S. cases to local and state health departments. As of July 29, a total of 570 U.S. MIS-C patients who met the case definition had been reported to CDC. A total of 203 (35.6%) of the patients had a clinical course consistent with previously published MIS-C reports, characterized predominantly by shock, cardiac dysfunction, abdominal pain, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers, and almost all had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. The remaining 367 (64.4%) of MIS-C patients had manifestations that appeared to overlap with acute COVID-19 (2-4), had a less severe clinical course, or had features of Kawasaki disease.§ Median duration of hospitalization was 6 days; 364 patients (63.9%) required care in an intensive care unit (ICU), and 10 patients (1.8%) died. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to expand in many jurisdictions, clinicians should be aware of the signs and symptoms of MIS-C and report suspected cases to their state or local health departments; analysis of reported cases can enhance understanding of MIS-C and improve characterization of the illness for early detection and treatment.","Godfred-Cato, Shana; Bryant, Bobbi; Leung, Jessica; Oster, Matthew E; Conklin, Laura; Abrams, Joseph; Roguski, Katherine; Wallace, Bailey; Prezzato, Emily; Koumans, Emilia H; Lee, Ellen H; Geevarughese, Anita; Lash, Maura K; Reilly, Kathleen H; Pulver, Wendy P; Thomas, Deepam; Feder, Kenneth A; Hsu, Katherine K; Plipat, Nottasorn; Richardson, Gillian; Reid, Heather; Lim, Sarah; Schmitz, Ann; Pierce, Timmy; Hrapcak, Susan; Datta, Deblina; Morris, Sapna Bamrah; Clarke, Kevin; Belay, Ermias",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,742,16

It sheds light on (1) the practical application of Kurdish semi-autonomy in Syria along with its successes and shortcomings in the public health sphere;and (2) how COVID-19 has affected intra-Kurdish politics in Syria and Kurdistan. Although changes in the political framework of Syria are not expected in the near future, the pandemic has underscored the fissures between the Kurds and the central government. Since the pandemic reached Syria, the Syrian government has almost completely neglected the health situation in the Kurdish territories. The Kurdish Autonomous Administration, in turn, recruited all the means at its disposal to cope independently with the crisis. These on-the-ground developments are signs for both the overt and covert, anxious hopes and strivings of the Kurds for autonomy. To assess the prospects for Kurdish autonomy, the article also analyzes the Kurds' relationships with the states involved in the Syrian conflict and the historical landmarks of intra-Kurdish politics. © 2021 Ariel University Press.

Doing this early would save millions of lives and help countries keep a stable economy. The easiest way to control the spread of a virus is to immediately inform the individuals who recently had close contact with the diagnosed patients. However, to achieve this, a centralized authority (e.g., a health authority) needs detailed location information from both healthy individuals and diagnosed patients. Thus, such an approach, although beneficial to control the spread of a virus, results in serious privacy concerns, and hence privacy-preserving solutions are required to solve this problem. Previous works on this topic either (i) compromise privacy (especially privacy of diagnosed patients) to have better efficiency or (ii) provide unscalable solutions. In this work, we propose a technique based on private set intersection between physical contact histories of individuals (that are recorded using smart phones) and a centralized database (run by a health authority) that keeps the identities of the positive diagnosed patients for the disease. Proposed solution protects the location privacy of both healthy individuals and diagnosed patients and it guarantees that the identities of the diagnosed patients remain hidden from other individuals. Notably, proposed scheme allows individuals to receive warning messages indicating their previous contacts with a positive diagnosed patient. Such warning messages will help them realize the risk and isolate themselves from other people. We make sure that the warning messages are only observed by the corresponding individuals and not by the health authority. We also implement the proposed scheme and show its efficiency and scalability via simulations.","Demirag, Didem; Ayday, Erman",,742,24

There have been numerous studies that bring out the difference in the level and quality of healthcare received by racial and ethnic minorities. However, most of these studies have focused on using socioeconomic status to account for minorities being disproportionately affected by health-related issues and ailments. We investigate the cumulative and ever-increasing gap in healthcare facilities and the resultant inequality which leads to Hispanics being severely affected by the novel coronavirus more than any other race or ethnicity. The study highlights the importance of considering a cumulative inequality effect that can help explain the reason for minorities being more prone to Covid-19. Even with an increase in their socioeconomic status, Hispanics have a way higher infection rate than other races. It is here that we use the cumulative inequality theory to explain the counterintuitive observation above. A cumulative inequality in healthcare facilities over the years helps to account for the disproportionate infection rate among the Hispanic population. We conduct empirical case comparisons (ECCs) to test our hypotheses and find that socioeconomic status is not sufficient to explain the higher infection rates among the minority population. We propose using cumulative inequality theory to fight both the current infection rate among minorities and fortify them from being negatively affected by future pandemics as well. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

Understanding the viral transmission and impeding the replication process within human cells are considered as the vital point to control and overcome COVID-19 infection. Non-structural Protein 1, one among the proteins initially produced upon viral entry into human cells, instantly binds with the human ribosome and inhibit the host translation process by preventing the mRNA attachment. However, the formation of NSP1 bound Ribosome complex does not affect the viral replication process. NSP1 plays an indispensable role in modulating the host gene expression and completely steals the host cellular machinery. The full-length structure of NSP1 is essential for the activity in the host cell and importantly the loop connecting N and C-terminal domains are reported to play a role in ribosome binding. Due to the unavailability of the experimentally determined full-length structure of NSP1, we have modelled the complete structure using comparative modelling and the stability and conformational behaviour of the modelled structure was evaluated through molecular dynamics simulation. Interestingly, the present study reveals the significance of the inter motif loop to serves as a potential binding site for drug discovery experiments. Further, we have screened the phytochemicals from medicinal plant sources since they were used for several hundred years that minimizes the traditional drug development time. Among the 5638 phytochemicals screened against the functionally associated binding site of NSP1, the best five phytochemicals shown high docking score of -9.63 to -8.75 kcal/mol were further evaluated through molecular dynamics simulations to understand the binding affinity and stability of the complex. Prime MM-GBSA analysis gave the relative binding free energies for the top five compounds (dihydromyricetin, 10-demethylcephaeline, dihydroquercetin, pseudolycorine and tricetin) in the range of -45.17 kcal/mol to -37.23 kcal/mol, indicating its binding efficacy in the predicted binding site of NSP1. The density functional theory calculations were performed for the selected five phytochemicals to determine the complex stability and chemical reactivity. Thus, the identified phytochemicals could further be used as effective anti-viral agents to overcome COVID-19 and as well as several other viral infections.","Prabhu, Dhamodharan; Rajamanikandan, Sundaraj; Sureshan, Muthusamy; Jeyakanthan, Jeyaraman; Saraboji, Kadhirvel",J Mol Graph Model,742,33

Through this global spread, many nations have witnessed exponential growth of confirmed cases brought under control by severe mass quarantine or lockdown measures. However, some have, through a different timeline of actions, prevented this exponential growth. Currently as some continue to tackle growth, others attempt to safely lift restrictions whilst avoiding a resurgence. This study seeks to quantify the impact of government actions in mitigating viral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by means of training neural network models to predict the daily slope increase of cumulative infected and by using such models in an optimisation study aimed at understanding the best set of mitigating actions. Data for two nations, Italy and Taiwan, have been gathered to model government restrictions in traveling, testing and enforcement of social distance measures as well as people connectivity and adherence to government actions. It is found that a larger and earlier testing campaign with tighter entry restrictions benefit both nations, resulting in significantly less confirmed cases. Interestingly, this scenario couples with an earlier but milder implementation of nationwide restrictions for Italy, thus supporting Taiwan's lack of nationwide lockdown. The results, found with a purely data-driven approach, are in line with the main findings of mathematical epidemiological models, proving that the proposed approach has value and that the data alone contains valuable knowledge to inform decision makers.","Riccardi, Annalisa; Gemignani, Jessica; Fern'andez-Navarro, Francisco; Heffernan, Anna",,742,16

414823,414823,414823,Prevention from COVID-19 in India: Fuzzy Logic Approach,13.003741,-0.059862673,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic comprises a total of more than 2,350,000 cases and 160,000 deaths. The interest in anti-coronavirus drug development has been limited so far and effective methods to prevent or treat coronavirus infections in humans are still lacking. Urgent action is needed to fight this fatal coronavirus infection by reducing the number of infected people along with the infection contagiousness and severity. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak several weeks ago, we observe in GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences (Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France) a lower prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 infections in psychiatric patients (â¼4%) compared to health care professionals (â¼14%). Similar observations have been noted in other psychiatric units in France and abroad. Our hypothesis is that psychiatric patients could be protected from severe forms of COVID-19 by their psychotropic treatments. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a phenothiazine derivative widely used in clinical routine in the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses. This first antipsychotic medication has been discovered in 1952 by Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker at Sainte-Anne hospital. In addition, to its antipsychotic effects, several in vitro studies have also demonstrated a CPZ antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recently, independent studies revealed that CPZ is an anti-MERS-CoV and an anti-SARS-CoV-1 drug. In comparison to other antiviral drugs, the main advantages of CPZ lie in its biodistribution: (i) preclinical and clinical studies have reported a high CPZ concentration in the lungs (20-200 times higher than in plasma), which is critical because of the respiratory tropism of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) CPZ is highly concentrated in saliva (30-100 times higher than in plasma) and could therefore reduce the contagiousness of COVID-19; (iii) CPZ can cross the blood-brain barrier and could therefore prevent the neurological forms of COVID-19. METHODS: Our hypothesis is that CPZ could decrease the unfavorable evolution of COVID-19 infection in oxygen-requiring patients without the need for intensive care, but also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. At this end, we designed a pilot, phase III, multicenter, single blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. Efficacy of CPZ will be assessed according to clinical, biological and radiological criteria. The main objective is to demonstrate a shorter time to response (TTR) to treatment in the CPZ+standard-of-care (CPZ+SOC) group, compared to the SOC group. Response to treatment is defined by a reduction of at least one level of severity on the WHO-Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI). The secondary objectives are to demonstrate in the CPZ+SOC group, compared to the SOC group: (A) superior clinical improvement; (B) a greater decrease in the biological markers of viral attack by SARS-CoV-2 (PCR, viral load); (C) a greater decrease in inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP and lymphopenia); (D) a greater decrease in parenchymal involvement (chest CT) on the seventh day post-randomization; (E) to define the optimal dosage of CPZ and its tolerance; (F) to evaluate the biological parameters of response to treatment, in particular the involvement of inflammatory cytokines. Patient recruitment along with the main and secondary objectives are in line with WHO 2020 COVID-19 guidelines. CONCLUSION: This repositioning of CPZ as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug offers an alternative and rapid strategy to alleviate the virus propagation and the infection severity and lethality. This CPZ repositioning strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps and can save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easy to manage side effects. Indeed, CPZ is an FDA-approved drug with an excellent tolerance profile, prescribed for around 70 years in psychiatry but also in clinical routine in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, in advanced cancer and also to treat headaches in various neurological conditions. The broad spectrum of CPZ treatment - including antipsychotic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antiviral, immunomodulatory effects along with inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and modulation of blood-brain barrier - is in line with the historical French commercial name for CPZ, i.e. LARGACTIL, chosen as a reference to its ""LARGe ACTion"" properties. The discovery of those CPZ properties, as for many other molecules in psychiatry, is both the result of serendipity and careful clinical observations. Using this approach, the field of mental illness could provide innovative therapeutic approaches to fight SARS-CoV-2.","Plaze, M; Attali, D; Petit, A-C; Blatzer, M; Simon-Loriere, E; Vinckier, F; Cachia, A; Chrétien, F; Gaillard, R",Encephale,742,2

The newly discovered coronavirus, entitled SARS-CoV-2, is the seventh member of the human coronaviruses. The main pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is severe pneumonia, RNAaemia, accompanied by glass turbidity, and acute cardiac injury. It possesses a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome which is 60-140 nm in diameter, and has a size of 26-32 kbp. Viral pathogenesis is accomplished with spike glycoprotein through the employment of a membrane-bound aminopeptidase, called the ACE2, as its primary cell receptor. It has been confirmed that various factors such as different national rules for quarantine and various races or genetic backgrounds might influence the mortality and infection rate of COVID-19 in the geographic areas. In addition to various known and unknown factors and host genetic susceptibility, mutations and genetic variabilities of the virus itself have a critical impact on variable clinical features of COVID-19. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome is more stable than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, it has a relatively high dynamic mutation rate with respect to other RNA viruses. It's noteworthy that, some mutations can be founder mutations and show specific geographic patterns. Undoubtedly, these mutations can drive viral genetic variability, and because of genotype-phenotype correlation, resulting in a virus with more/lower/no decrease in natural pathogenic fitness or on the other scenario, facilitating their rapid antigenic shifting to escape the host immunity and also inventing a drug resistance virus, so converting it to a more infectious or deadly virus. Overall, the detection of all mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and their relations with pathological changes is nearly impossible, mostly due to asymptomatic subjects. In this review paper, the reported mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 and related variations in virus structure and pathogenicity in different geographic areas and genotypes are widely investigated. Many studies need to be repeated in other regions/locations for other people to confirm the findings. Such studies could benefit patient-specific therapy, according to genotyping patterns of SARS-CoV-2 distribution.","Bakhshandeh, Behnaz; Jahanafrooz, Zohreh; Abbasi, Ardeshir; Goli, Matin Babaee; Sadeghi, Mahya; Mottaqi, Mohammad Sadeq; Zamani, Maryam",Microb Pathog,742,9

Prolonged delays in cancer screening will increase cancer in the overall population from pre-COVID-19 trajectories, and elevate the cancer disparity in minority populations. Knowing the overall benefit of cancer screening versus the risk of acquiring COVID-19, utilizing at-home screening tests and keeping the COVID-19-induced delay in screening to a minimum might slow the growth of disparity.","Carethers, John M; Sengupta, Rajarshi; Blakey, Rea; Ribas, Antoni; D039,; Souza, Gypsyamber",Cancer Prev Res (Phila),742,6

STUDY DESIGN: Children ages 0-22 years with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection presenting to urgent care clinics or being hospitalized for confirmed/suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at Massachusetts General Hospital were offered enrollment in the Massachusetts General Hospital Pediatric COVID-19 Biorepository. Enrolled children provided nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and/or blood specimens. SARS-CoV-2 viral load, ACE2 RNA levels, and serology for SARS-CoV-2 were quantified. RESULTS: A total of 192 children (mean age, 10.2 ± 7.0 years) were enrolled. Forty-nine children (26%) were diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection; an additional 18 children (9%) met the criteria for MIS-C. Only 25 children (51%) with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection presented with fever; symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, if present, were nonspecific. Nasopharyngeal viral load was highest in children in the first 2 days of symptoms, significantly higher than hospitalized adults with severe disease (P = .002). Age did not impact viral load, but younger children had lower angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression (P = .004). Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were increased in severe MIS-C (P < .001), with dysregulated humoral responses observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that children may be a potential source of contagion in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic despite having milder disease or a lack of symptoms; immune dysregulation is implicated in severe postinfectious MIS-C.","Yonker, Lael M; Neilan, Anne M; Bartsch, Yannic; Patel, Ankit B; Regan, James; Arya, Puneeta; Gootkind, Elizabeth; Park, Grace; Hardcastle, Margot; St John, Anita; Appleman, Lori; Chiu, Michelle L; Fialkowski, Allison; De la Flor, Denis; Lima, Rosiane; Bordt, Evan A; Yockey, Laura J; D039,; Avino, Paolo; Fischinger, Stephanie; Shui, Jessica E; Lerou, Paul H; Bonventre, Joseph V; Yu, Xu G; Ryan, Edward T; Bassett, Ingrid V; Irimia, Daniel; Edlow, Andrea G; Alter, Galit; Li, Jonathan Z; Fasano, Alessio",J Pediatr,742,5

In this pre-text, this study examined the stock market behaviour in 15 selected Asian markets amid the pandemic. The results infer about the surge in market return volatilities amid the rapid spread of the coronavirus which was primarily triggered through the impaired investors' sentiments due to the announcement effects. During this period, the stock market performances in selected Asian countries have been observed to be influenced by the reporting of the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and death cases, stock index returns, market volatility, oil prices, inflation rate, and interest rates.","Mishra, P.

In 2016, the World Health Organization set out to reduce the rate of new HCV infections by 90% by 2030. Still, global control of the virus does not seem to be achievable in the absence of an effective vaccine. Current approaches to the development of a vaccine against HCV include the production of recombinant proteins, synthetic peptides, DNA vaccines, virus-like particles, and viral vectors expressing various antigens. In this review, we focus on the development of vaccines targeting the humoral immune response against HCV based on the cumulative evidence supporting the important role of neutralizing antibodies in protection against HCV infection. The main targets of HCV-specific neutralizing antibodies are the glycoproteins E1 and E2. Recent advances in the knowledge of HCV glycoprotein structure and their epitopes, as well as the possibility of getting detailed information on the human antibody repertoire generated by the infection, will allow rational structure-based antigen design to target specific germline antibodies. Although obtaining a vaccine capable of inducing sterilizing immunity will be a difficult task, a vaccine that prevents chronic hepatitis C infections, a more realistic goal in the short term, would have a considerable health impact.","Sepulveda-Crespo, Daniel; Resino, Salvador; Martinez, Isidoro",J Biomed Sci,742,16

Growing evidences that overweight and obesity which extent nearly a third of the world population were associated with severe COVID-19. This study aimed to explore the association and risk of increased BMI and obesity with composite poor outcome in COVID-19 adult patients. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search from PubMed and Embase database. We included all original research articles in COVID-19 adult patients and obesity based on classification of Body Mass Index (BMI) and composite poor outcome which consist of ICU admission, ARDS, severe COVID-19, use of mechanical ventilation, hospital admission, and mortality. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included in meta-analysis with 9 studies presented BMI as continuous outcome and 10 studies presented BMI as dichotomous outcome (cut-off &#8805;30 kg/m2). COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome had higher BMI with mean difference 1.12 (95% CI, 0.67-1.57, P < 0.001). Meanwhile, obesity was associated with composite poor outcome with odds ratio (OR) = 1.78 (95% CI, 1.25-2.54, P < 0.001) Multivariate meta-regression showed the association between BMI and obesity on composite poor outcome were affected by age, gender, DM type 2, and hypertension. CONCLUSION: Obesity is a risk factor of composite poor outcome of COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome have higher BMI. BMI is an important routine procedure that should always be assessed in the management of COVID-19 patients and special attention should be given to patients with obesity.","Soeroto, Arto Yuwono; Soetedjo, Nanny Natalia; Purwiga, Aga; Santoso, Prayudi; Kulsum, Iceu Dimas; Suryadinata, Hendarsyah; Ferdian, Ferdy",Diabetes Metab Syndr,742,21

Depression is a common mental health problem that deteriorates the quality of life of people with HIV/AIDS and found to be a strong predictor for noncompliance to antiretroviral therapy treatment. Therefore, epidemiological evidence on the factors associated with depression among patients with HIV/AIDS can contribute towards effective and efficient preventive health care strategies for this population. Objectives: To assess the prevalence and factors associated with depression among HIV/AIDS-infected patients attending ART clinic at Jimma University Medical Center, Jimma, Southwest Ethiopia, in 2018. Methods: This study followed an institution-based cross-sectional quantitative study design. A simple random sampling method yielded 303 participants who were interviewed from April to May 2018, using a pretested questionnaire, followed by their card review. The SPSS version 23 was used for bivariate analysis which was used to find out the significance of association. Variables that showed association in bivariate analysis at p value < 0.25 were entered to multivariable logistic regressions to control for confounders, and the significance of association was determined by 95% confidence interval and p value < 0.05. Results: The point prevalence of depression was 94 (31%). Variables like sex (AOR = 0.510 (95%CI = 0.264-0.986)), marital status (AOR = 3.610 (95%CI = 1.649-7.901)), opportunistic infection (AOR = 3.122 (95%CI = 1.700-5.733)), and medication adherence (AOR = 0.470 (95%CI = 0.266-0.831)) were significantly associated with depression. Conclusion and Recommendation. From the findings of this study, it is possible to conclude that depression was highly prevalent among people living with HIV/ADS. Sex, marital status, opportunistic infection, and medication adherence were found to be associated with depression and need attention from the health professional working in the ART clinic.","Dorsisa, Beyene; Ahimed, Gutema; Anand, Susan; Bekela, Tariku",Psychiatry J,742,16

In this study, we evaluated the most frequent neurological symptoms in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and also investigated the possible relationship between plasmatic inflammatory indices and olfactory disorders (ODs) and between muscle pain and creatine kinase (CK). METHODS: We consecutively enrolled hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A structured questionnaire concerning typical and neurological symptoms, focusing on headache, dizziness, ODs, taste disorders (TDs), and muscle pain, was administrated by telephone interviews. RESULTS: Common neurological symptoms were reported in the early phase of the disease, with a median onset ranging from 1 to 3 days. Headache showed tension-type features and was more frequently associated with a history of headache. Patients with ODs less frequently needed oxygen therapy. Inflammatory indices did not significantly differ between patients with and without ODs. Muscle pain did not show any association with CK level but was more frequently associated with arthralgia and headache. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, ODs were an early symptom of COVID-19, more frequently reported by patients with milder forms of disease. Headache in association with arthralgia and muscle pain seems to reflect the common symptoms of the flu-like syndrome, and not COVID-19 infection-specific.","Vacchiano, Veria; Riguzzi, P; Volpi, L; Tappatà, M; Avoni, P; Rizzo, G; Guerra, L; Zaccaroni, S; Cortelli, P; Michelucci, R; Liguori, R",Neurol Sci,742,3

The spectrum of phenotypes associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection, ranging from the absence of symptoms to severe systemic complications, raised the question as to what extent the variable response to coronaviruses (CoVs) is influenced by the variability of the hosts' genetic background.To explore the current knowledge about this question, we designed a systematic review encompassing the scientific literature published from Jan. 2003 to June 2020, to include studies on the contemporary outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (namely SARS, MERS and COVID-19 diseases). Studies were eligible if human genetic variants were tested as predictors of clinical phenotypes.An ad hoc protocol for the rapid review process was designed according to the PRISMA paradigm and registered at the PROSPERO database (ID: CRD42020180860). The systematic workflow provided 32 articles eligible for data abstraction (28 on SARS, 1 on MERS, 3 on COVID-19) reporting data on 26 discovery cohorts. Most studies considered the definite clinical diagnosis as the primary outcome, variably coupled with other outcomes (severity was the most frequently analysed). Ten studies analysed HLA haplotypes (1 in patients with COVID-19) and did not provide consistent signals of association with disease-associated phenotypes. Out of 22 eligible articles that investigated candidate genes (2 as associated with COVID-19), the top-ranked genes in the number of studies were ACE2, CLEC4M (L-SIGN), MBL, MxA (n = 3), ACE, CD209, FCER2, OAS-1, TLR4, TNF-&#945; (n = 2). Only variants in MBL and MxA were found as possibly implicated in CoV-associated phenotypes in at least two studies. The number of studies for each predictor was insufficient to conduct meta-analyses.Studies collecting large cohorts from different ancestries are needed to further elucidate the role of host genetic variants in determining the response to CoVs infection. Rigorous design and robust statistical methods are warranted.","Di Maria, Emilio; Latini, Andrea; Borgiani, Paola; Novelli, Giuseppe",Hum Genomics,742,18

Those with severe disease are treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) but with poor outcomes. Concomitant right ventricular assist device (RVAD) may be beneficial. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of intensive care unit patients admitted with COVID-19 ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) was performed. Nonintubated patients, those with acute kidney injury, and age > 75 were excluded. Patients who underwent RVAD/ECMO support were compared with those managed via invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) alone. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-d mortality, acute kidney injury, length of ICU stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 145 patients were admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. Thirty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 21 received IMV, and 18 received RVAD/ECMO. In-hospital (52.4 versus 11.1%, P = 0.008) and 30-d mortality (42.9 versus 5.6%, P= 0.011) were significantly lower in patients treated with RVAD/ECMO. Acute kidney injury occurred in 15 (71.4%) patients in the IMV group and zero RVAD/ECMO patients (P< 0.001). ICU (11.5 versus 21 d, P= 0.067) and hospital (14 versus 25.5 d, P = 0.054) length of stay were not significantly different. There were no RVAD/ECMO device complications. The duration of mechanical ventilation was not significantly different (10 versus 5 d, P = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS: RVAD support at the time of ECMO initiation resulted in the no secondary end-organ damage and higher in-hospital and 30-d survival versus IMV in specially selected patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS. Management of severe COVID-19 ARDS should prioritize right ventricular support.","Cain, Michael T; Smith, Nathan J; Barash, Mark; Simpson, Pippa; Durham, Lucian A; Makker, Hemanckur; Roberts, Christopher; Falcucci, Octavio; Wang, Dong; Walker, Rebekah; Ahmed, Gulrayz; Brown, Sherry-Ann; Nanchal, Rahul S; Joyce, David L",J Surg Res,742,20

The data were analyzed by estimation of simple correlation coefficients and a Preacher and Hayes's mediation procedure. RESULTS: Participants reported elevated levels of stress (7-8 sten on the sten scale developed for the PSS-10 questionnaire). Statistically significant differences in the stress levels between nurses, paramedics and physicians could not determined. In contrast, significant association between mental health outcomes and occupational category could not be found. Coping mediated the relationship between coping strategies and mental health outcomes. A positive and significant relationship was observed between stress, dysfunctional coping strategies and mental health. CONCLUSION: Our observations support the assumption about a controlling role of coping in the relationship between work-related stress and mental health outcomes in the medical staff working amid pandemic.","Warchol-Biedermann, Katarzyna; Daroszewski, Przmyslaw; Baczyk, Grazyna; Greberski, Krzysztof; Bugajski, Pawel; Karon, Jacek; Mojs, Ewa; Ziarko, Michal; Jasielska, Aleksandra; Samborski, Wlodzimierz",,742,26

This study aimed to elucidate whether disinfectants claiming 'virucidal activity against enveloped viruses' as specified in the European Standard EN 14476 as well as in the German Association for the Control of Viral Diseases/Robert Koch Institute (DVV/RKI) guideline are effectively inactivating SARS-CoV-2. Two commercially available formulations for surface disinfection and one formulation for hand disinfection were studied regarding their virucidal activity. Based on the data of this study the enveloped SARS-CoV-2 is at least equally susceptible compared to the standard test virus vaccinia used in the EN 14476 and DVV/RKI guidelines. Thus, chemical disinfectants claiming 'virucidal activity against enveloped viruses' based on the EN 14476 and DVV/RKI guidelines will be an effective choice to target enveloped SARS-CoV-2 as a preventive measure.","Steinhauer, K; Meister, T L; Todt, D; Krawczyk, A; Paßvogel, L; Becker, B; Paulmann, D; Bischoff, B; Eggers, M; Pfaender, S; Brill, F H H; Steinmann, E",J Hosp Infect,742,16

This challenge is exemplified in Myanmar, where an active shark fishery exists despite a nationwide ban on targeted shark fishing. We used the Kipling method (5W1H) to gather a complete story of non-compliance in five small-scale fishing communities in the Myeik Archipelago. Among 144 fishers surveyed, 49% were aware of the nationwide ban. Shark fishers (24%) tended to be younger individuals who did not own a boat and perceived shark fishing to be prevalent. Compliant fishers were motivated by a fear of sharks and lack of capacity (equipment, knowledge), whereas food and income were cited as key motivations for non-compliance. The results of our study emphasize that in resource-dependent communities, improving compliance for effective shark conservation may require addressing broader issues of poverty, food security and the lack of alternatives.","MacKeracher, Tracy; Mizrahi, Me039; ira,; Bergseth, Brock; Maung, Khin May Chit; Khine, Zin Lin; Phyu, Ei Thal; Simpfendorfer, Colin A; Diedrich, Amy",Ambio,742,1
