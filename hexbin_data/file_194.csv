474,474,474,Rapid detection of pandemic influenza in the presence of seasonal influenza,20.068113,1.6106884,2010-11-24,"BACKGROUND: Key to the control of pandemic influenza are surveillance systems that raise alarms rapidly and sensitively. In addition, they must minimise false alarms during a normal influenza season. We develop a method that uses historical syndromic influenza data from the existing surveillance system 'SERVIS' (Scottish Enhanced Respiratory Virus Infection Surveillance) for influenza-like illness (ILI) in Scotland. METHODS: We develop an algorithm based on the weekly case ratio (WCR) of reported ILI cases to generate an alarm for pandemic influenza. From the seasonal influenza data from 13 Scottish health boards, we estimate the joint probability distribution of the country-level WCR and the number of health boards showing synchronous increases in reported influenza cases over the previous week. Pandemic cases are sampled with various case reporting rates from simulated pandemic influenza infections and overlaid with seasonal SERVIS data from 2001 to 2007. Using this combined time series we test our method for speed of detection, sensitivity and specificity. Also, the 2008-09 SERVIS ILI cases are used for testing detection performances of the three methods with a real pandemic data. RESULTS: We compare our method, based on our simulation study, to the moving-average Cumulative Sums (Mov-Avg Cusum) and ILI rate threshold methods and find it to be more sensitive and rapid. For 1% case reporting and detection specificity of 95%, our method is 100% sensitive and has median detection time (MDT) of 4 weeks while the Mov-Avg Cusum and ILI rate threshold methods are, respectively, 97% and 100% sensitive with MDT of 5 weeks. At 99% specificity, our method remains 100% sensitive with MDT of 5 weeks. Although the threshold method maintains its sensitivity of 100% with MDT of 5 weeks, sensitivity of Mov-Avg Cusum declines to 92% with increased MDT of 6 weeks. For a two-fold decrease in the case reporting rate (0.5%) and 99% specificity, the WCR and threshold methods, respectively, have MDT of 5 and 6 weeks with both having sensitivity close to 100% while the Mov-Avg Cusum method can only manage sensitivity of 77% with MDT of 6 weeks. However, the WCR and Mov-Avg Cusum methods outperform the ILI threshold method by 1 week in retrospective detection of the 2009 pandemic in Scotland. CONCLUSIONS: While computationally and statistically simple to implement, the WCR algorithm is capable of raising alarms, rapidly and sensitively, for influenza pandemics against a background of seasonal influenza. Although the algorithm was developed using the SERVIS data, it has the capacity to be used at other geographic scales and for different disease systems where buying some early extra time is critical.","Singh, Brajendra K; Savill, Nicholas J; Ferguson, Neil M; Robertson, Chris; Woolhouse, Mark EJ",BMC Public Health,194,5

We report key themes from an agenda-setting, multi-disciplinary roundtable convened to examine experiences and implications for health systems in Ghana, a nation without cases but where risk for spread is high and the economic, social and political impact of the impending threat is already felt. DISCUSSION: Participants’ personal stories and the broader debates to define fundamental issues and opportunities for preparedness focused on three inter-related themes. First, the dangers of the fear response itself were highlighted as a threat to the integrity and continuity of quality care. Second, healthcare workers’ fears were compounded by a demonstrable lack of societal and personal protections for infection prevention and control in communities and healthcare facilities, as evidenced by an ongoing cholera epidemic affecting over 20,000 patients in the capital Accra alone since June 2014. Third, a lack of coherent messaging and direction from leadership seems to have limited coordination and reinforced a level of mistrust in the government’s ability and commitment to mobilize an adequate response. Initial recommendations include urgent investment in the needed supplies and infrastructure for basic, routine infection control in communities and healthcare facilities, provision of assurances with securities for frontline healthcare workers, establishment of a multi-sector, “all-hazards” outbreak surveillance system, and engaging directly with key community groups to co-produce contextually relevant educational messages that will help decrease stigma, fear, and the demoralizing perception that the disease defies remedy or control. SUMMARY: The EVD epidemic provides an unprecedented opportunity for West African countries not yet affected by EVD cases to make progress on tackling long-standing health systems weaknesses. This roundtable discussion emphasized the urgent need to strengthen capacity for infection control, occupational health and safety, and leadership coordination. Significant commitment is needed to raise standards of hygiene in communities and health facilities, build mechanisms for collaboration across sectors, and engage community stakeholders in creating the needed solutions. It would be both devastating and irresponsible to waste the opportunity.","Nyarko, Yaw; Goldfrank, Lewis; Ogedegbe, Gbenga; Soghoian, Sari; de-Graft Aikins, Ama",Global Health,194,5
3682,3682,3682,Diagnostic tests for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever: a widespread tickborne disease,19.753124,1.7348408,2019-02-20,"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread tickborne disease that circulates in wild and domestic animal hosts, and causes severe and often fatal haemorrhagic fever in infected humans. Due to the lack of treatment options or vaccines, and a high fatality rate, CCHF virus (CCHFV) is considered a high-priority pathogen according to the WHO R&D Blueprint. Several commercial reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and serological diagnostic assays for CCHFV are already available, including febrile agent panels to distinguish CCHFV from other viral haemorrhagic fever agents; however, the majority of international laboratories use inhouse assays. As CCHFV has numerous amplifying animal hosts, a cross-sectoral ‘One Health’ approach to outbreak prevention is recommended to enhance notifications and enable early warning for genetic and epidemiological shifts in the human, animal and tick populations. However, a lack of guidance for surveillance in animals, harmonisation of case identification and validated serodiagnostic kits for animal testing hinders efforts to strengthen surveillance systems. Additionally, as RT-PCR tests tend to be lineage-specific for regional circulating strains, there is a need for pan-lineage sensitive diagnostics. Adaptation of existing tests to point-of-care molecular diagnostic platforms that can be implemented in clinic or field-based settings would be of value given the potential for CCHFV outbreaks in remote or low-resource areas. Finally, improved access to clinical specimens for validation of diagnostics would help to accelerate development of new tests. These gaps should be addressed by updated target product profiles for CCHFV diagnostics.","Mazzola, Laura T; Kelly-Cirino, Cassandra",BMJ Glob Health,194,5

The aim of this review is to understand and explore the concepts of global health diplomacy (GHD), health security, and human security. For this narrative review, a literature search was done in PubMed, Scopus, and EBSCO for the “global health diplomacy,” “health security,” and “human security,” and full-texts were reviewed. The recent outbreaks of Ebola in West Africa and Zika in South America are pertinent examples of the nature of the human security crisis and the imminent and severe threat posed to human life across the globe as a result of these epidemics. The Commission on Human Security defines human security as the protection of the vital core of all human lives from critical and pervasive threats. We highlight the ways in which health has now become an issue of national security/global concern and also how GHD can aid in the development of new bilateral or multilateral agreements to safeguard the health and security of people in our globalized world. The paper provides a prospective about, and overview of, health and human security that essentially emphasizes the growing interlinkages between global health, diplomacy, and foreign policy.","Chattu, Vijay Kumar; Knight, Andy W; Kevany, Sebastian; Sehovic, Annamarie Bindenagel",J Educ Health Promot,194,5
4364,4364,4364,Restrictive Measures in an Influenza Pandemic: A Qualitative Study of Public Perspectives,20.002945,1.549243,2012-09-01,"OBJECTIVES: Recent experiences have demonstrated that restrictive measures remain a useful public health tool during infectious disease outbreaks. However, the use of restrictive measures is not without controversy, as there is no agreed-upon threshold for when and how to invoke restrictive measures. The objectives of this study are to solicit perspectives from Canadians on the ethical considerations of using restrictive measures in response to influenza pandemics, and in turn, to use public views to contribute to a better understanding of what is considered to be the justifiable use of restrictive measures. METHODS: A series of town hall focus groups with Canadian residents from June 2008 to May 2009, in three Canadian regions, in order to achieve broad public engagement (n=3 focus groups with a total of 17 participants). RESULTS: Two key themes emerged from all town hall focus groups: 1) create an environment for compliance through communication rather than enforcement, and 2) establish the delineation between individual rights, community values, and the greater good. CONCLUSION: While there is a need for a decision-making authority and even a mechanism for enforcement, our data suggest that a more tractable approach to restrictive measures is one that enables individuals to voluntarily comply by creating an environment to compel compliance based on communication. This approach requires restrictive measures to be a) proportional to the threat, b) implemented along with reciprocal arrangements provided to those affected, and c) accompanied by open and transparent communication throughout all stages so that citizens can both understand and participate in decision-making.","Smith, Maxwell J.; Bensimon, Cécile M.; Perez, Daniel F.; Sahni, Sachin S.; Upshur, Ross E.

6689,6689,6689,Nosocomial infections in pediatric intensive care units,19.732473,10.092594,2001,"Neuromuscular disorders increasingly are recognized as a complication in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and represent a common cause of prolonged ventilator dependency. The distinct syndromes of critical illness myopathy, prolonged neuromuscular blockade, and critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) may arise as a consequence of sepsis, multi-organ failure, and exposure to various medications—notably, intravenous corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents—but the pathophysiology of these disorders remains poorly understood. More than one syndrome may occur simultaneously, and the distinctions may be difficult in a particular patient, but a specific diagnosis usually can be established after careful clinical, electrodiagnostic, and, when necessary, histological evaluation. For example, asthmatics requiring treatment with corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents may develop an acute myopathy characterized by generalized weakness, preserved eye movements, elevated creatine kinase levels, and myopathic motor units on electromyography (EMG). Muscle biopsy demonstrates distinctive features of thick (myosin) filament loss on ultrastructural studies. Conversely, those with a prolonged ICU course that is complicated by episodes of sepsis with failure to wean from the ventilator, distal or generalized flaccid limb weakness, and areflexia probably have CIP. EMG in these patients demonstrates reduced or absent motor and sensory potentials with neurogenic motor units. Prolonged neuromuscular blockade most commonly occurs in patients with renal failure who have received prolonged infusions of neuromuscular blockers. There is severe flaccid, areflexic paralysis with normal sensation, facial weakness, and ophthalmoparesis that persists for days or weeks after the neuromuscular blockers have been discontinued. Repetitive nerve stimulation shows a decrement of the compound muscle action potential and, in most cases, establishes a disorder of neuromuscular transmission. With the recent epidemic of West Nile virus infection, a clinical syndrome of acute flaccid paralysis with several features indistinguishable from poliomyelitis has emerged. This article critically examines the clinical, electrophysiological, and pathological features of these and other acute neuromuscular syndromes that arise in the context of ICU care and summarizes the current understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of these disorders.","Gorson, Kenneth C.",Neurocrit Care,194,12

The cannula was placed 3–4 cm proximal to the Peyer's patch, and was used to deliver four weekly doses of the potent mucosal immunogen, cholera toxin (CT). Anti-CT specific fecal secretory IgA (S-IgA), serum IgG and serum IgA were found in essentially equal amounts in rabbits with cannulas and in rabbits fitted with Thiry-Vella (T-V) isolated ileal loops. In contrast to animals with T-V loops, the intestinal flora of animals with cannulas contained less bacterial overgrowth with Pseudomonas sp. Further, the villus architecture remained histologically normal in appearance and there were fewer post-surgical complications associated with this technique than with T-V loops. This simplified technique should allow wider use of rabbits in studies of mucosal immunity.","McAleer, Frank T.; Silbart, Lawrence K.; Van Kruiningen, Herbert J.; Koudelka, Jan; Tobias, Allison",J Immunol Methods,194,5

In this work, we set up an experimental methodology for the fabrication of GO@peptide hybrids by the immobilization, via irreversible physical adsorption, of the Ac-(GHHPH)(4)-NH(2) peptide sequence, known to mimic the anti-angiogenic domain of the histidine-proline-rich glycoprotein (HPRG). The anti-proliferative capability of the graphene-peptide hybrids were tested in vitro by viability assays on prostate cancer cells (PC-3 line), human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), and human retinal endothelial cells (primary HREC). The anti-angiogenic response of the two cellular models of angiogenesis, namely endothelial and prostate cancer cells, was scrutinized by prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) release and wound scratch assays, to correlate the activation of inflammatory response upon the cell treatments with the GO@peptide nanocomposites to the cell migration processes. Results showed that the GO@peptide nanoassemblies not only effectively induced toxicity in the prostate cancer cells, but also strongly blocked the cell migration and inhibited the prostaglandin-mediated inflammatory process both in PC-3 and in HRECs. Moreover, the cytotoxic mechanism and the internalization efficiency of the theranostic nanoplatforms, investigated by mitochondrial ROS production analyses and confocal microscopy imaging, unraveled a dose-dependent manifold mechanism of action performed by the hybrid nanoassemblies against the PC-3 cells, with the detection of the GO-characteristic cell wrapping and mitochondrial perturbation.

We aimed to identify prognostic clinical and laboratory factors that predict progression to severe disease in febrile children presenting from the community. METHODS: We systematically reviewed publications retrieved from MEDLINE, Web of Science and Embase between 31 May 1999 and 30 April 2020, supplemented by hand search of reference lists and consultation with an expert Technical Advisory Panel. Studies evaluating prognostic factors or clinical prediction models in children presenting from the community with febrile illnesses were eligible. The primary outcome was any objective measure of disease severity ascertained within 30 days of enrolment. We calculated unadjusted likelihood ratios (LRs) for comparison of prognostic factors, and compared clinical prediction models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs). Risk of bias and applicability of studies were assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool and the Quality In Prognosis Studies tool. RESULTS: Of 5949 articles identified, 18 studies evaluating 200 prognostic factors and 25 clinical prediction models in 24 530 children were included. Heterogeneity between studies precluded formal meta-analysis. Malnutrition (positive LR range 1.56–11.13), hypoxia (2.10–8.11), altered consciousness (1.24–14.02), and markers of acidosis (1.36–7.71) and poor peripheral perfusion (1.78–17.38) were the most common predictors of severe disease. Clinical prediction model performance varied widely (AUROC range 0.49–0.97). Concerns regarding applicability were identified and most studies were at high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies address this important public health question. We identified prognostic factors from a wide range of geographic contexts that can help clinicians assess febrile children at risk of progressing to severe disease. Multicentre studies that include outpatients are required to explore generalisability and develop data-driven tools to support patient prioritisation and triage at the community level.

RESULTS: Among the 154 cases, 42 were identified as imported and most of them returned from Cambodia. A total of 113 blood samples were obtained and 106 were identified as DENV-1, two as DENV-2, and five were negative through RT-PCR. All DENV-1 strains sequenced in this study were all classified to one cluster and owned a high similarity with a Cambodia strain isolated in 2019. The evolutionary relationships of amino acid were consistent with that of nucleotide genome result. The sequence-based findings of Jiangxi strains were consistent with epidemiological investigation.

The current treatment strategy relies on the extensive usage of classical inactivated vaccine which is marred by large doses, short immunization cycles and safety concerns. METHODS: The present study aimed at optimization of RDPV VP2 gene, subcloning the gene into plasmid pET30a, and its subsequent transfer to Escherichia coli with trigger factor 16 for co-expression. The protein thus expressed was purified with ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic chromatography, and endotoxin extraction procedures. VLPs were examined by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and the efficacy of VLPs vaccine was tested in vivo. RESULTS: Results indicated that RDPV VP2 protein could be expressed soluble. Transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering results indicated that RDPV VP2 self-assembled into VLPs. Hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers elicited by Al(OH)(3) adjuvanted RDPV VLPs were comparable with RDPV inactivated vaccines, and the viral loads in the blood of the struck raccoon dogs were greatly reduced.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether use of the ratio of prehospital oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (Spo(2)) to fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio(2)) measured during initial contact by EMS with the patient (ie, the first Spo(2) to Fio(2) ratio) and 5 minutes before the patient’s arrival at the hospital (ie, the second Spo(2) to Fio(2) ratio) can predict the risk of early in-hospital deterioration. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective, derivation-validation prognostic cohort study of 3606 adults with acute diseases referred to 5 tertiary care hospitals in Spain was conducted between October 26, 2018, and June 30, 2020. Eligible patients were recruited from among all telephone requests for EMS assistance for adults who were later evacuated with priority in advanced life support units to the referral hospitals during the study period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was hospital mortality from any cause within the first, second, third, or seventh day after EMS transport to the hospital. The main measure was the Spo(2) to Fio(2) ratio. RESULTS: A total of 3606 participants comprised 2 separate cohorts: the derivation cohort (3081 patients) and the validation cohort (525 patients). The median age was 69 years (interquartile range, 54-81 years), and 2122 patients (58.8%) were men. The overall mortality rate of the patients in the study cohort ranged from 3.6% for 1-day mortality (131 patients) to 7.1% for 7-day mortality (256 patients). The best model performance was for 2-day mortality with the second Spo(2) to Fio(2) ratio with an area under the curve of 0.890 (95% CI, 0.829-0.950; P < .001), although the other outcomes also presented good results. In addition, a risk-stratification model was generated. The optimal cutoff resulted in the following ranges of Spo(2) to Fio(2) ratios: 50 to 100 for high risk of mortality, 101 to 426 for intermediate risk, and 427 to 476 for low risk. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that use of the prehospital Spo(2) to Fio(2) ratio was associated with improved management of patients with acute disease because it accurately predicts short-term mortality.","Martín-Rodríguez, Francisco; López-Izquierdo, Raúl; del Pozo Vegas, Carlos; Delgado-Benito, Juan F.; Ortega, Guillermo J.; Castro Villamor, Miguel A.; Sanz-García, Ancor",JAMA Netw Open,194,5

We find complex networks of risk flows dispersed risk countrywide: increasing the risk of acquiring HIV in some areas, decreasing it in others. Overall, 40% of risk was mobility-driven. Networks contained multiple risk hubs. All constituencies (administrative units) imported and exported risk, to varying degrees. A few exported very high levels of risk: their residents infected many residents of other constituencies. Notably, prevalence in the constituency exporting the most risk was below average. Large-scale networks of mobility-driven risk flows underlie generalized HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. In order to eliminate HIV, it is likely to become increasingly important to implement innovative control strategies that focus on disrupting risk flows.","Valdano, Eugenio; Okano, Justin T.; Colizza, Vittoria; Mitonga, Honore K.; Blower, Sally",Nat Commun,194,5

Although previous studies developed artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic systems for detecting infantile cataracts in a single center, its generalizability is not ideal because of the complicated noises and heterogeneity of multicenter slit-lamp images, which impedes the application of these AI systems in real-world clinics. In this study, we developed two lens partition strategies (LPSs) based on deep learning Faster R-CNN and Hough transform for improving the generalizability of infantile cataracts detection. A total of 1,643 multicenter slit-lamp images collected from five ophthalmic clinics were used to evaluate the performance of LPSs. The generalizability of Faster R-CNN for screening and grading was explored by sequentially adding multicenter images to the training dataset. For the normal and abnormal lenses partition, the Faster R-CNN achieved the average intersection over union of 0.9419 and 0.9107, respectively, and their average precisions are both > 95%. Compared with the Hough transform, the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of Faster R-CNN for opacity area grading were improved by 5.31, 8.09, and 3.29%, respectively. Similar improvements were presented on the other grading of opacity density and location. The minimal training sample size required by Faster R-CNN is determined on multicenter slit-lamp images. Furthermore, the Faster R-CNN achieved real-time lens partition with only 0.25 s for a single image, whereas the Hough transform needs 34.46 s. Finally, using Grad-Cam and t-SNE techniques, the most relevant lesion regions were highlighted in heatmaps, and the high-level features were discriminated. This study provides an effective LPS for improving the generalizability of infantile cataracts detection. This system has the potential to be applied to multicenter slit-lamp images.","Jiang, Jiewei; Lei, Shutao; Zhu, Mingmin; Li, Ruiyang; Yue, Jiayun; Chen, Jingjing; Li, Zhongwen; Gong, Jiamin; Lin, Duoru; Wu, Xiaohang; Lin, Zhuoling; Lin, Haotian",Front Med (Lausanne),194,5

Effective verbal and written communication are crucial to allow this collaboration; however, misunderstanding of terminology can lead to confusion, poor decision-making and poor health outcomes. Methods A voluntary questionnaire with multiple-choice and short-answer questions was given to patients attending the NHS Lothian Oral Surgery and Oral Medicine Department over two weeks; 137 were completed. Eighteen terms were assessed, including: ulcer, local anaesthetic, impacted tooth, radiograph, sedation, biopsy, mucosa and benign. Exclusion criteria were non-English speakers who required a translator. Results The multiple-choice questions revealed that terms such as 'blister' and 'local anaesthetic' are relatively well understood. Other terms, such as mucosa, were poorly understood. Over a third of patients confused 'sedation' with general anaesthetic. Short-answer questions revealed a wide range of answers. 'Biopsy' and 'radiograph' were generally better understood compared to other terms. Demographics, educational background and English as a first language appeared to have an influence on understanding. Conclusion Patients had a varied understanding of terminology. Incorrect interpretation of words may lead to ill-informed decision-making or unnecessary concern. It is essential that challenging terminology is identified and explained at an understandable level.

Subjective uncertainties always occur when people are not able to predict the further course of a situation or future events due to lack of experience or information. If such uncertainties occur during the use of automated vehicles, the development of trust and thus acceptance of this technology is impaired by the negative emotions accompanying subjective uncertainties. Within the AutoAkzept project (which full title translates to: Automation without uncertainty to increase the acceptance of automated and connected driving), solutions for user-focused automation have been developed that put vehicle occupants at the center of system development. User-focused systems take into account two basic human needs in human-machine interaction, the need to understand and the need to be understood. For this purpose, user-focused systems use different sensors to detect subjective uncertainties and their influencing factors in real time, integrate this information with context data and make adjustments that reduce subjective uncertainties. The systemic adaptations of user-focused systems follow a holistic approach that includes the levels of vehicle guidance, interior adaptation and information presentation as well as target guidance are included. By reducing or avoiding subjective uncertainties, the project developments contribute to a positive, comfortable user experience and help to increase the acceptance of ACD. This paper presents research results of AutoAkzept on the topics of user state and activity modelling as well as needs-based adaptation strategies, which represent key components for the implementation of user-focused automation.","Drewitz, Uwe; Wilbrink, Marc; Oehl, Michal; Jipp, Meike; Ihme, Klas",Forsch Ingenieurwes,194,30

Cost-effective interventions for the prevention and control of NCDs can be delivered at PHC facilities in low-resource settings by clinical healthcare workers (HCWs). AIM: This study compared the knowledge of HCWs in PHC facilities regarding the prevention and control of NCDs in rural and urban local government areas (LGAs) of Osun State. SETTING: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted amongst 400 eligible HCWs recruited using a multistage sampling technique in PHC facilities of six rural and six urban LGAs. METHODS: A pretested self-administered case-scenarios questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge of HCWs regarding the prevention and control of three selected NCDs (diabetes, hypertension and chronic respiratory diseases). Both descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted. RESULTS: The mean knowledge scores of HCWs regarding the prevention and control of the three NCDs were 17.76 ± 4.41 in rural and 17.62 ± 4.02 in urban LGAs out of 30 maximum scores. The proportion of HCWs with adequate knowledge in the rural LGAs (31.0%) was slightly higher than the urban LGAs (23.0%); however, it was not statistically significant (χ(2) = 3.247; p = 0.072). The major determinants of adequate knowledge include cadre of HCWs, location, years in practice with professional certificate, NCD training course attendance and reported experience managing diabetic patients. CONCLUSION: The HCWs in PHC facilities in rural and urban LGAs of Osun State, Nigeria, had a poor knowledge regarding the prevention and control of NCDs. Training and re-training of less-skilled HCWs in the PHC facilities using relevant WHO NCD protocols and guidelines are imperatives to improve their knowledge about the prevention and control of NCDs.","Akinwumi, Adebowale F.; Esimai, Olapeju A.; Fajobi, Olusola; Idowu, Ajibola; Esan, Oluwaseun T.; Ojo, Temitope O.",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,194,5

The motor output of respiratory-independent muscles was seldomly considered regarding possible influences of smells. The Adaptive Force (AF) characterizes the capability of the neuromuscular system to adapt to external forces in a holding manner and was suggested to be more vulnerable to possible interfering stimuli due to the underlying complex control processes. The aim of this pilot study was to measure the effects of olfactory inputs on the AF of the hip and elbow flexors, respectively. The AF of 10 subjects was examined manually by experienced testers while smelling at sniffing sticks with neutral, pleasant or disgusting odours. The reaction force and the limb position were recorded by a handheld device. The results show, inter alia, a significantly lower maximal isometric AF and a significantly higher AF at the onset of oscillations by perceiving disgusting odours compared to pleasant or neutral odours (p < 0.001). The adaptive holding capacity seems to reflect the functionality of the neuromuscular control, which can be impaired by disgusting olfactory inputs. An undisturbed functioning neuromuscular system appears to be characterized by a proper length tension control and by an earlier onset of mutual oscillations during an external force increase. This highlights the strong connection of olfaction and motor control also regarding respiratory-independent muscles.","Schaefer, Laura V.; Dech, Silas; Aehle, Markus; Bittmann, Frank N.",Sci Rep,194,5

To investigate the prevalence and genetic characteristics of RSV in China, we performed a molecular epidemiological study during 2015–2019. A total of 964 RSV-positive specimens were identified from 5529 enrolled patients during a multi-center study. RSV subgroup A (RSV-A) was the predominant subgroup during this research period except in 2016. Totally, 535 sequences of the second hypervariable region (HVR-2) of the G gene were obtained. Combined with 182 Chinese sequences from GenBank, phylogenetic trees showed that 521 RSV-A sequences fell in genotypes ON1 (512), NA1 (6) and GA5 (3), respectively; while 196 RSV-B sequences fell in BA9 (193) and SAB4 (3). ON1 and BA9 were the only genotypes after December 2015. Genotypes ON1 and BA9 can be separated into 10 and 7 lineages, respectively. The HVR-2 of genotype ON1 had six amino acid changes with a frequency more than 10%, while two substitutions H258Q and H266L were co-occurrences. The HVR-2 of genotype BA9 had nine amino acid substitutions with a frequency more than 10%, while the sequences with T290I and T312I were all from 2018 to 2019. One N-glycosylation site at 237 was identified among ON1 sequences, while two N-glycosylation sites (296 and 310) were identified in the 60-nucleotide duplication region of BA9. To conclusion, ON1 and BA9 were the predominant genotypes in China during 2015–2019. For the genotypes ON1 and BA9, the G gene exhibited relatively high diversity and evolved continuously.

A previously published and successfully evaluated pharmacokinetic model of critically ill patients was used for stochastic simulations of virtual patients. Maintenance doses administered as continuous infusion of 1.5–6 g/24 h with preceding loading doses (administered as 30 min infusion) of 0.15–2 g were investigated. In addition to the examination of the influence of individual covariates, a best-case and worst-case scenario were simulated. Dosing regimens were considered adequate if the 5th percentile of the concentration–time profile did not drop at any time below four times the S/I breakpoint (= 2 mg/L) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa according to the EUCAST definition. Low albumin concentrations, high body weight and high creatinine clearances increased the required loading dose. A maximum loading dose of 0.33 g resulted in sufficient plasma concentrations when only one covariate showed extreme values. If all three covariates showed extreme values (= worst-case scenario), a loading dose of 0.5 g was necessary. Higher loading doses did not lead to further improvements of target attainment. We recommend the administration of a loading dose of 0.5 g meropenem over 30 min immediately followed by continuous infusion.","Liebchen, Uwe; Salletmeier, Hanna; Kallee, Simon; Scharf, Christina; Huebner, Lucas; Weber, Alexandra; Zoller, Michael",Sci Rep,194,30

Ad12 replicates in human cells but undergoes a completely abortive cycle in Syrian hamster cells. Ad12 induces neuro-ectodermal tumors in newborn hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Each tumor cell or Ad12-transformed hamster cell carries multiple copies of integrated Ad12 DNA. Ad12 DNA usually integrates at one chromosomal site which is not specific since Ad12 DNA can integrate at many different locations in the hamster genome. Epigenetic research occupies a prominent role in tumor biology. We have been using the human Ad12 Syrian hamster cell system for the analysis of epigenetic alterations in Ad12-infected cells and in Ad12-induced hamster tumors. Virion or free intracellular Ad12 DNA remains unmethylated at CpG sites, whereas the integrated viral genomes become de novo methylated in specific patterns. Inverse correlations between promoter methylation and activity were described for the first time in this system and initiated active research in the field of DNA methylation and epigenetics. Today, promoter methylation has been recognized as an important factor in long-term genome silencing. We have also discovered that the insertion of foreign (Ad12, bacteriophage lambda, plasmid) DNA into mammalian genomes can lead to genome-wide alterations in methylation and transcription patterns in the recipient genomes. This concept has been verified recently in a pilot study with human cells which had been rendered transgenomic for a 5.6 kbp bacterial plasmid. Currently, we study epigenetic effects on cellular methylation and transcription patterns in Ad12-infected cells and in Ad12-induced hamster tumor cells. These epigenetic alterations are considered crucial elements in (viral) oncogenesis.","Doerfler, Walter",Epigenetics of Infectious Diseases,194,5

The resulting parameter estimates are subject to uncertainty that arises from errors (noise) in the data; standard statistical techniques can be used to estimate the magnitude of this uncertainty. The estimates are also dependent on the structure of the model used in the fitting process and so any uncertainty regarding this structure leads to additional uncertainty in the parameter estimates. We argue that if we lack detailed knowledge of the biology of the transmission process, parameter estimation should be accompanied by a structural sensitivity analysis, in addition to the standard statistical uncertainty analysis. Here we focus on the estimation of the basic reproductive number from the initial growth rate of an outbreak as this is a setting in which parameter estimation can be surprisingly sensitive to details of the time course of infection.","Lloyd, A.L.",Mathematical and Statistical Estimation Approaches in Epidemiology,194,5

Responses often come through reallocation of resources from one disease control effort to a new pressing need. The operating models of preparedness and response are ill-equipped to prevent or ameliorate disease emergence or reemergence at global scales. Epidemiological challenges that are a threat to the economic stability of many regions of the world, particularly those depending on travel and trade, remain at the forefront of the Global Commons. Consequently, efforts to quantify the impact of mobility and trade on disease dynamics have dominated the interests of theoreticians for some time. Our experience includes an H1N1 influenza pandemic crisscrossing the world during 2009 and 2010, the 2014 Ebola outbreaks, limited to regions of West Africa lacking appropriate medical facilities, health infrastructure, and sufficient levels of preparedness and education, and the expanding Zika outbreaks, moving expeditiously across habitats suitable for Aedes aegypti. These provide opportunities to quantify the impact of disease emergence or reemergence on the decisions that individuals take in response to real or perceived disease risks. The case of SARS 2003 in 2003, the efforts to reduce the burden of H1N1 influenza cases in 2009, and the challenges faced in reducing the number of Ebola cases in 2014 are the three recent scenarios that required a timely global response. Studies addressing the impact of centralized sources of information, the impact of information along social connections, or the role of past disease outbreak experiences on the risk-aversion decisions that individuals undertake may help identify and quantify the role of human responses to disease dynamics while recognizing the importance of assessing the timing of disease emergence and reemergence. The co-evolving human responses to disease dynamics are prototypical of the feedbacks that define complex adaptive systems.

TC II deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. It is characterized by failure to thrive, diarrhoea, pallor, anaemia, pancytopenia or agammaglobulinemia. It is usually confirmed by molecular analysis of the TCN2 gene. We report a 2-month-old girl with two novel mutations, which were first reported in humans. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 2-month-old Chinese girl with pancytopenia, severe combined immunodeficiency disease, and megaloblastic anaemia. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed, which detected compound heterozygous variants in exon 7 of the TCN2 gene (Mutation 1: c.1033 C > T; Mutation 2: c.1017-1031delinsGTAACAGAGATGGTT). These mutations result in stop codons in TCN2. The c.1033C > T mutation causes a stop at codon 345 (p.Gln345Ter), and the c.1017-1031delinsGTAACAGAGATGGTT mutation causes a stop at codon 340 (p.Leu340Ter). After being diagnosed, she was treated with intramuscular 1 mg hydroxycobalamin (OH-Cbl) every day for 2 months. The CBC value returned to normal after half a month. The peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and immunoglobulin recovered after 2 months. Then, the dosage of OH-Cbl was gradually reduced. CONCLUSIONS: TC II deficiency is a serious complication that requires lifelong treatment. Its diagnosis is difficult due to the lack of clearly identifiable symptoms. Genetic testing should be performed as early as possible if this disease is suspected. The specific observations of this case report make a considerable contribution to the literature and provide a reference for the diagnosis and treatment of future cases.","Zhan, Shihong; Cheng, Fangfang; He, Hailong; Hu, Shaoyan; Feng, Xing",BMC Pediatr,194,30

SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus, and little is known about the basic characteristics of this pathogen, the underlying mechanism of infection, and the potential treatments. The immune system has been known to be actively involved in viral infections. To facilitate the development of COVID-19 treatments, the understanding of immune regulation by this viral infection is urgently needed. This review describes the mechanisms of immune system involvement in viral infections and provides an overview of the dysregulation of immune responses in COVID-19 patients in recent studies. Furthermore, we emphasize the role of gut microbiota in regulating immunity and summarized the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the composition of the microbiome. Overall, this review provides insights for understanding and developing preventive and therapeutic strategies by regulating the immune system and microbiota.","Wang, Chuxi; Zhou, Xin; Wang, Meng; Chen, Xin",,194,16

Methods: The authors queried Google Trends for over 100 oculofacial plastic surgery terms. The main outcome measure was the top 50 oculofacial plastic surgery-related search terms from 2004 to 2020. Secondary outcomes were trends, including seasonality, and search volume changes during the COVID-19 lockdown (March-May 2020) compared to 2018-2019. Terms were analyzed individually and in thematic categories; controlled against generic search terms to account for general internet traffic. Results: Between 2004 and 2020, searches for oculofacial plastic surgery altogether increased, surpassing the rate of internet traffic growth. One thematic category - eyelid malpositions - decreased month-over-month. The top five terms were ""face lift,"" ""Bell's palsy,"" ""puffy eyes,"" ""dark circles under eyes,"" and ""chalazion."" Eyelid neoplasms searches peaked in summer (R2 = 0.880) whereas cosmetic (R2 = 0.862), symptoms (R 2 = 0.907), and surgeries (R 2 = 0.140) peaked in winter. Overall, oculofacial-related searches decreased during the COVID-19 lockdown, although thyroid eye disease interest increased compared to 2018 or 2019 (+68.6%; adj. p = .005). Oculofacial plastic surgery interest in 2020 was inversely correlated to ""COVID-19"" searches (r = -0.76, p < .001). Conclusions: Oculofacial plastic surgery searches increased since 2004 at a pace greater than that ascribed to internet traffic growth. The most searched terms were ""face lift,"" ""Bell's palsy,"" ""puffy eyes,"" ""dark circles under eyes,"" and ""chalazion.""

Proteins are required to recognize G4 structures and coordinate their function. Here we identify Zuo1 as a novel G4-binding protein in vitro and in vivo. In vivo in the absence of Zuo1 fewer G4 structures form, cell growth slows and cells become UV sensitive. Subsequent experiments reveal that these cellular changes are due to reduced levels of G4 structures. Zuo1 function at G4 structures results in the recruitment of nucleotide excision repair (NER) factors, which has a positive effect on genome stability. Cells lacking functional NER, as well as Zuo1, accumulate G4 structures, which become accessible to translesion synthesis. Our results suggest a model in which Zuo1 supports NER function and regulates the choice of the DNA repair pathway nearby G4 structures.","De Magis, Alessio; Götz, Silvia; Hajikazemi, Mona; Fekete-Szücs, Enikő; Caterino, Marco; Juranek, Stefan; Paeschke, Katrin",Nature communications,194,1

Three key explanations were articulated: alcohol is needed for socialising; drinking helps coping with stress; alcohol and drug treatment services are inadequate. These results demonstrate justifications for heavy drinking in certain contexts. This behaviour runs counter to public health approaches and messages that highlight low-risk levels of drinking or not drinking as desirable.

We tested the hypothesis that children hospitalized with rhinovirus (RV) bronchiolitis, either as a sole pathogen or in combination with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are at increased risk of relapse. METHODS We performed a 16-center, prospective cohort study of hospitalized children age <2 years with bronchiolitis. During the winters of 2007-2010, researchers collected clinical data and nasopharyngeal aspirates from study participants; the aspirates were tested using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The primary outcome was bronchiolitis relapse (urgent bronchiolitis visit or scheduled visit at which additions to the bronchiolitis medications were made) during the 2 weeks after hospital discharge. RESULTS Among 1836 enrolled children with 2-week, follow-up data, the median age was 4 months and 60% were male. Overall, 48% had sole RSV infection, 8% had sole RV infection, and 13% had RSV/RV coinfection. Compared with children with sole RSV infection, and adjusting for 10 demographic and clinical characteristics and clustering of patients within hospitals, children with sole RV infection did not differ in their likelihood of relapse (odds ratio: 0.99; 95% confidence interval: 0.52-1.90; P = 0.98), whereas those with RSV/RV coinfection were more likely to have relapse (odds ratio: 1.54; 95% confidence interval: 1.03-2.30; P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS In this prospective, multicenter, multiyear study of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, we found that RSV/RV coinfection was independently associated with a higher likelihood of bronchiolitis relapse. Present data support the concept that the infectious etiology of severe bronchiolitis affects short-term outcomes.","Hasegawa, Kohei; Mansbach, Jonathan M; Teach, Stephen J; Fisher, Erin S; Hershey, Daniel; Koh, Joyce Y; Clark, Sunday; Piedra, Pedro A; Sullivan, Ashley F; Camargo, Carlos A",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,194,16

METHODS We analyzed the circumstances of suicides occurring from 2005 to 2016 in 16 states (Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin) among females aged 10 years and above. We compared the percentages of circumstances reported for the entire sample, by age group, and by race/ethnicity. Trends in changes in the leading circumstances were analyzed using Joinpoint regression. RESULTS From 2005 to 2016, there were 27,809 suicides among females 10 years and older in the 16 states. Overall, the 2 leading precipitating circumstances were current mental health problem and ever treated for mental health problem. The leading circumstances differed by demographics. Joinpoint analysis showed inflection points in reports of job problems, financial problems, and non-intimate partner relationship problems during 2005-2009.

METHODS We selected 1,061 patients with diabetes from the Zhili Town Health Center's hospital information system. We tracked and studied their outpatient and inpatient expenses, treatment behaviors, incidence of complications, and satisfaction over 5 years. We compared the data collected from 2014 to 2019 to determine the trends of these four factors and the effects of the integrated delivery system for patients with diabetes. RESULTS We found that the average costs for diabetes patients in outpatient and inpatient departments were increasing slightly every year. The number of patients in tertiary hospitals has decreased significantly, while the number of patients in community hospitals (primary hospitals) has increased, and the number of patients in secondary hospitals has remained relatively unchanged. Meanwhile, the expenses per visit were also lower over this period in hospitals at all levels. Diabetes complications have been increasing marginally, and there is a relatively high degree of satisfaction among patients and doctors in primary hospitals, which is rising.

We sought to evaluate the predictive values in brain metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations. Methods We retrospectively examined 133 patients with brain metastases (BMs) from lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations. NLR was calculated using N/L, where N and L, respectively, refer to peripheral blood neutrophil (N) and lymphocyte (L) counts. The cut-off value of NLR was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC). The Log rank test and Cox proportional hazard model were used to confirm the impact of NLR and other variables on survival. Results An NLR value equal to or less than 2.99 was associated with prolonged survival in this cohort of patients in both variable and multivariable analysis. Conclusion We concluded that NLR is an independent prognostic factor in BMs from lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations. This could serve as a useful prognostic biomarker and could be incorporated in the clinical prognostic index specific to patients with BMs.","Li, Hongwei; Wang, Weili; Yang, Xiaotang; Lian, Jianhong; Zhang, Shuangping; Cao, Jianzhong; Zhang, Xiaqin; Song, Xin; Jia, Sufang; Xue, Ruiqi",Cancer management and research,194,1

Determining the relative weights of each ASPECTS region may improve patient selection for endovascular stroke therapy (EST). Methods In the combined Solitaire Flow Restoration with the Intention for Thrombectomy (SWIFT), Solitaire Flow Restoration Thrombectomy for Acute Revascularization (STAR), and Solitaire Flow Restoration with the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment (SWIFT PRIME) databases, we identified patients treated with the Solitaire stent retriever. Using 24-h CT scan, a multivariate ordinal regression was used to determine the relative contribution of each ASPECTS region to clinical outcome separately in each hemisphere. The coefficients from the regression were used to create a weighted ASPECTS (wASPECTS), which was compared with the original ASPECTS to predict 90-day modified Rankin Scale disability outcomes in an independent validation cohort. Results Among 342 patients treated with EST, the average age was 67 years, 57% were female, and the median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 17 (IQR 13-20). The median ASPECTS at presentation was 8 (IQR 7-10). The most commonly involved ASPECTS regions on 24-h CT were the lentiform nuclei (70%), insula (55%), and caudate (52%). In multivariate analysis, preservation of M6 (β = 9.7) and M4 (β = 4.4) regions in the right hemisphere was most strongly predictive of good outcome. For the left hemisphere, M6 (β = 5.5), M5 (β = 4.1), and M3 (β = 3.1) generated the greatest parameter estimates, though they did not reach statistical significance. A wASPECTS incorporating all 20 parameter estimates resulted in improved discrimination against the original ASPECTS in the independent cohort (C-statistic 0.78 vs. 0.67, right hemisphere). Conclusions For both right and left hemisphere, preservation of the high cortical regions was more strongly associated with improved outcomes compared to the deep regions. Our findings support taking into consideration the location and relative weightings of the involved ASPECTS regions when evaluating a patient for EST.","Sheth, Sunil A; Malhotra, Konark; Liebeskind, David S; Liang, Conrad W; Yoo, Albert J; Jahan, Reza; Nogueira, Raul G; Pereira, Vitor; Gralla, Jan; Albers, Greg; Goyal, Mayank; Saver, Jeffrey L",Interventional neurology,194,1

We administered a single dose of TN intraperitoneally. Twenty-four hours later, MAdCAM-1, PECAM-1 and CAV-1 expression levels in Peyer's patches and villi were examined using immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF) and western blotting. Immunostaining of MAdCAM-1 and CAV-1 in control and TN treated Peyer's patches and villi exhibited similar staining patterns. The immunoreactivity of PECAM-1 was similar for the control and TN treated Payer's patches, whereas staining was decreased significantly in TN treated villi. Our findings suggest that short term TN treatment did not affect leukocyte movement to lymphoid compartments of the small intestine, but it altered villus architecture due to decreased PECAM-1 expression.","Öztel, Zübeyde; Gazan, Sibel; Balcan, Erdal",Biotechnic & histochemistry : official publication of the Biological Stain Commission,194,1

This study aimed at determining whether some food items on sale around an industrialized area of Ogun State are contaminated with trace metals. Methods Seven different food items - Clarias gariepinus (roasted, fresh and smoked) Bos taurus (dried and fresh beef), zobo leaf (Hibiscus sabdariffa) and crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus) were sampled from three major markets, namely: Lusada, Atan and Ota in Ado-Odo/Ota LGA of Ogun State. They were analyzed for Lead, Cadmium, Nickel, Manganese and Zinc using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. Results Cd was not detected in most of the food items across the markets. Pb, Ni and Mn were detected in very high concentrations above the maximum allowable limits by international regulatory agencies. Zn was the only metal that was generally below regulatory limits in food items across the three markets. The Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) and Target Hazard Quotient (THQ) values were generally higher than values acceptable in food. Conclusion Some of the food items consumed in this area are not entirely safe from metal toxicity and this may have serious health consequences.","Ayanda, Opeyemi Isaac; Bello, Oluwakemi Adetutu; Nwabuisi, Oluwatosin Ifeanyichukwu",African health sciences,194,16

In this study, a detailed characterization of 88 porcine S. suis isolates was performed by analyzing capsular (cps) types, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and investigation of the minimum core genome (MCG). In order to focus on the virulence potential of presumable invasive disease-associated S. suis isolates, virulence-associated gene profiles were assessed followed by screening a chosen subset of S. suis strains with a molecular pathotyping tool. Results showed a high genetic variability within this strain collection. In total, seventeen cps types were identified with a predominance of cps type 9 (15.9%) and 6 (14.8%). MLST revealed 48 sequence types (STs) including 41 novel ones. The population structure of S. suis was heterogenous and isolates belonged to eight different clonal complexes (CCs) including CC28 (9.1%), CC1109 (8%), CC13/149 (6.8%), CC1237 (5.7%), CC1 (3.4%), CC17 (3.4%), CC87 (2.3%), and CC1112 (1.1%), whereas a significant portion of isolates (60.2%) could not be assigned to any described CCs. Virulence-associated markers, namely extracellular protein factor (epf), muramidase-released protein (mrp), and suilysin (sly), showed a link with STs rather than with cps types. With this study an expanded knowledge about the population structure and the genetic diversity of S. suis could be achieved, which helps to contribute to an optimal public health surveillance system by promoting a focus on strains with an increased virulence and zoonotic potential.","Scherrer, Simone; Rosato, Giuliana; Spoerry Serrano, Nathalie; Stevens, Marc J A; Rademacher, Fenja; Schrenzel, Jacques; Gottschalk, Marcelo; Stephan, Roger; Peterhans, Sophie",Veterinary research,194,1

There is still debate about the need to perform a complete lobectomy for some of these lesions, and some advocate observation rather than resection, despite possible long-term complications of untreated lesions. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans and physical findings at the time of surgery, along with new advanced techniques, now allow for discrete partial anatomic resections, which may preserve normal lung. This study evaluates the feasibility and early results using these techniques in selected cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS With institutional review board approval, the records of all patients undergoing thoracoscopic lung resection were reviewed. From January 2006 to December 2012, 23 patients, ranging from 1 month to 16 years of age and weighing 3.8-42 kg, underwent thoracoscopy for planned resection. Pathology was congenital cystic lung disease in 19 patients, bronchiectasis in 3 patients, and arteriovenous malformation in 1 patient. In each case findings on CT scan and at the time of surgery warranted consideration of lung-preserving surgery. Procedures were performed through three ports using single lung ventilation and CO2 insufflation to achieve lung collapse. The LigaSure™ device (Covidien, Norwalk, CT) was the primary instrument used to seal and divide the lung parenchyma and seal vessels. RESULTS All procedures were completed successfully thoracoscopically. An anatomic segmental resection was achieved in 22 of 23 cases. Operative time ranged from 30 to 300 minutes (mean, 120 minutes). Segmental resections included the left upper lobe apical/posterior (n=4), lingula (n=3), left lower lobe superior (n=5), medial or posterior basal (n=3), right middle lobe medial (n=1), right upper lobe apical (n=1), right lower lobe superior (n=4), and posterior basal (n=2). Two patients had more than one segment excised. Chest tubes were left in for 24 hours in 16 cases, 48 hours in 4 cases, and 5 days in 1 case. Hospital stay ranged from 1 to 6 days (mean, 2 days). Follow-up CT scans obtained at 1-6 years (mean, 28 months) show no residual disease in 20 of 21 patients. One patient underwent a nonanatomic resection and had evidence of recurrent congenital pulmonary airway malformation at the 4-year follow-up. This patient underwent a secondary thoracoscopic resection. CONCLUSIONS Thoracoscopic lung-conserving therapy is technically feasible and safe in infants and children. The magnification provided by a thoracoscopic approach makes identification of segmental anatomic planes easier, aiding in safe dissection and resection. Anatomic resection appears to be associated with a low morbidity. It may be appropriate in the case of bilateral or extensive disease or in cases where the diseased tissue is clearly limited to an anatomic segment. Continued long-term follow-up is needed.","Rothenberg, Steven S; Shipman, Kristin; Kay, Saundra; Kadenhe-Chiweshe, Angela; Thirumoorthi, Arul; Garcia, Alejandro; Czauderna, Piotr; Kravarusic, Dragan; Freud, Enrique",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Modern residency practices will include residents as junior partners and members of multidisciplinary faculty teams. Residency practices will measure and improve care consistent with the triple aim: enhancing the experience of care for patients, improving outcomes of care for populations, and reducing waste and the cost of care in the system.Curricula will include core elements of the roles of family physicians, including the development of therapeutic relationships with patients and families, recognizing patients' needs and expectations, professionalism, the identification and management of acute and chronic illness, maternity care, and the care of hospitalized patients. Also included will be emerging expectations of family physicians, including team roles, expanded care through telehealth and patient portals, identifying and intervening in modifiable social determinants of health, addressing structural racism, closing gaps of inequitable care for their patient populations, managing addiction as a treatable chronic illness, improving performance through clinical data registries, personalized medicine, and leadership. Wellness and assurance of a satisfying career will be a priority focus of preparation for career-long practice.

A well-known side effect of propofol is a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance resulting in hypotension, but little is known about the effects on microcirculation in humans. We aimed to evaluate the effects of propofol on the sublingual microcirculatory perfusion by continuous video imaging in pediatric patients undergoing procedural sedation. METHODS Patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for procedural sedation were recruited. Oral microcirculation was measured employing a continuous monitoring strategy with incident dark-field illumination imaging. Measurements were obtained before and 3 minutes after propofol induction. Total and perfused vessel densities, proportion of perfused vessels, microvascular flow index, blood vessel diameter (Øbv ), and systemic hemodynamics were analyzed. RESULTS Continuous measurements were achieved in seven patients. Three minutes after propofol induction mean arterial pressure decreased (P = 0.028) and total and perfused vessel densities increased by 12% (P = 0.018) and 16% (P = 0.018), respectively. MFI was unaltered and mean Øbv increased but not significantly. CONCLUSIONS Propofol induction induces a reduction in mean arterial pressure and a rise in sublingual microvascular perfusion. The observed effects of propofol on the sublingual microcirculation may be due to a decrease in microvascular resistance.","Riedijk, Maaike A; Milstein, Dan M J",Microcirculation,194,19

Downregulation of cytokeratin 18 (CK18) is a critical molecular event of EMT; however, its importance in the induction of EMT and CSC features has not been defined to date. This study aimed to investigate the biological significance and underlying molecular mechanisms of CK18 in inducing EMT phenotype and stemness properties of breast cancer cells. Three breast cancer cell lines (i.e., non-metastatic MCF-7, highly metastatic MDA-MB-231, and mitoxantrone (MX)-selected resistant MCF-7/MX cells) and two CK18-knockdown stable cell clones (MCF-7-shCK18-7D and 3C) were used to determine the association between CK18 and EMT and stemness. CK18 expression was extremely low in highly metastatic, resistant, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-treated breast cancer cells with mesenchymal phenotype and increased expression of CSC markers. Depletion of CK18 promoted partial EMT and the acquisition of stemness properties in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Mechanistically, CK18 interference in MCF-7 cells activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, resulting in the up-regulation of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). Consistently, the stemness properties and metastasis can be attenuated by further knockdown of EpCAM in CK18-depleted cells. In conclusion, downregulation of CK18 promotes partial EMT and enhances breast cancer stemness by increasing EpCAM expression partly via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. These findings indicate that CK18 may serve as a potential treatment target for advanced breast cancer.","Shi, Ruizan; Liu, Linhong; Wang, Fengge; He, Yifan; Niu, Yanan; Wang, Chang; Zhang, Xuanping; Zhang, Xiuli; Zhang, Huifeng; Chen, Min; Wang, Yan",Cellular signalling,194,16

We investigated the changes in the quality of life after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation among the survivors and examine the association between a worse quality of life and 3-year all-cause mortality. DESIGN This was a population-based cohort study. SETTING Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Service database in South Korea. PATIENTS Adult individuals (≥ 18 yr old) who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy from 2006 to 2017 were included. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation survivors were defined as patients who had survived for 1-year after the initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The income level, employment status, and registered disability were examined before and 1-year after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. The decreased income level, job loss, and newly acquired disability were considered as change in the quality of life among extracorporeal membrane oxygenation survivors. A total of 5,821 adult extracorporeal membrane oxygenation survivors were included in the final analysis, and 2,959 patients (50.8%) experienced quality of life change. Specifically, 1,782 patients (30.6%) experienced a decrease in income, 682 (11.7%) lost their jobs, and 1,540 (26.5%) had a new disability within 1-year after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. In the multivariable Cox regression model, newly acquired disability was associated with 2.31-fold higher 3-year all-cause mortality among extracorporeal membrane oxygenation survivors (hazard ratio, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.79-2.97; p < 0.001), while job loss (p = 0.180) and decreased income (p = 0.993) were not associated with the 3-year all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS At 12 months after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy, nearly half survivors experienced quality of life worsening such as unemployment, decreased income, and new disability. Additionally, among the three factors, acquiring a new disability might significantly increase the 3-year mortality. This is the first study to report the association between changes in the quality of life and long-term prognosis in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation survivors.","Cho, Hyoung-Won; Song, In-Ae; Oh, Tak Kyu",Critical care medicine,194,31

The objective of our study was to test instruments, implement protocols, and collect preliminary data for a larger 5-year study, which aims to improve detection of eye diseases and follow-up eye care in vulnerable populations using community health workers (CHW) and patient navigators. In the study, trained CHWs conducted vision screening and patient navigators scheduled on-site eye exams and arranged appointments for those referred to ophthalmology to improve adherence to follow-up eye care. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eligible individuals age 40-and-older were recruited from the Riverstone Senior Center in upper Manhattan, New York City. Participants underwent on-site vision screening (visual acuity with correction, intraocular pressure measurements, and fundus photography). Individuals who failed the vision screening were scheduled with an on-site optometrist for an eye exam; those with ocular pathologies were referred to an ophthalmologist. Participants were also administered the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-8 (NEI-VFQ-8) and Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries (STEADI) test by community health workers. RESULTS Participants (n=42) were predominantly older adults, with a mean age of 70.0 ± 9.8, female (61.9%), and Hispanic (78.6%). Most individuals (78.6%, n=33) failed vision screening. Of those who failed, 84.8% (n=28) attended the on-site eye exam with the optometrist.

Here we explored the epidemiology and etiology of two adenovirus serotype 3 outbreaks in Hangzhou in 2011. One acute respiratory outbreak was found in Chun'an County, where a total of 371 cases were confirmed in 5 of 23 towns from 4 to 31 May 2011. The outbreak affected 18.57% (13/70) of schools and 14.49% (90/621) of classes. The incidence was 5.18% (371/7,163). The population was distributed among individuals ages 7 to 15 years. No parents or teachers were infected. Another pharyngoconjunctival fever outbreak was discovered in the Chenjinglun Swimming Center located in the Xihu District between 1 and 15 July 2011. A total of 134 cases were confirmed in 900 amateur swimmers, with an incidence of 14.89% (134/900). The ages ranged from 4 to 9 years. The two outbreaks had no severe complications or death. The viruses in 66.67% (10/15) of throat swabs from children with acute respiratory infections and 100% (10/10) of the swabs from children with pharyngoconjunctival fever were confirmed to be adenovirus serotype 3 with 100% homology by PCR. Of these samples, 60.0% (12/20) had a classical characteristic cytopathic effect, presented as grape-like clusters at 72 h after infection in HEp-2 cells. In conclusion, the acute respiratory infection and pharyngoconjunctival fever outbreak in Hangzhou were caused by the completely homologous type 3 adenovirus in subgenus B. Moreover, these outbreaks demonstrated rapid transmission rates, possibly due to close contact and droplet transmission.","Xie, Li; Yu, Xin-Fen; Sun, Zhou; Yang, Xu-Hui; Huang, Ren-Jie; Wang, Jing; Yu, Apeng; Zheng, Lin; Yu, Man-Chu; Hu, Xiao-Wei; Wang, Ban-Ma; Chen, Jin; Pan, Jing-Cao; Liu, She-Lan",Journal of clinical microbiology,194,24

They support tissue during the early phase of healing until it regains enough tensile strength. The aim of this study was to compare four different suture materials in terms of the influence on wound healing, microbial adherence, tissue reaction, and relevant clinical parameters which determine their clinical value. MATERIALS AND METHODS Total number of 32 patients undergoing surgical extraction of four impacted third molars were involved in the study. Clinical parameters were estimated intraoperatively and during the control check-ups. Soft tissue healing around sutures were evaluated on the 3rd and 7th day postoperatively. Microbial colonization was assessed by means of qPCR. Also, histological analysis was done to assess inflammatory reaction. RESULTS Significantly better soft tissue healing was found around monofilament and synthetic sutures compared to multifilament and natural ones respectively. Soft tissue healing was significantly better around all sutures on the 7th day than on the 3rd day postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Non-resorbable polypropylene suture showed superior clinical characteristics among all sutures. Moreover, the best healing of soft tissue and the least inflammatory reaction was found around this thread. The poorest soft tissue healing was found around non-resorbable silk suture. This suture elicited strongest inflammatory reaction and showed the greatest microbial adherence affinity compared to alternative sutures. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Monofilament synthetic suture should be used in order to obtain the best soft tissue healing, reduce the risk of postoperative infection, and alleviate the suturing after oral surgery procedures.","Dragovic, Miroslav; Pejovic, Marko; Stepic, Jelena; Colic, Snjezana; Dozic, Branko; Dragovic, Svetlana; Lazarevic, Milos; Nikolic, Nadja; Milasin, Jelena; Milicic, Biljana",Clinical oral investigations,194,13

No proven definitive therapies for this infection currently exist. Unfortunately, the infected patients increased in an alarming way every day, faster than medical evidence. At present, the expanding knowledge regarding SARS-COV-2 virology provides several potential drug targets. OBJECTIVE Therefore, clinicians need a rapid review and guideline about the main adverse effects regarding the most prescribed drugs and, specifically, the efficacy and potential risk of each pharmacological therapy, during hospital care. METHODS The articles review was performed using PubMed to identify relevant papers in English language reported through July 20th, 2020; a second review was performed using Web of Science until August 28th. Due to the lack of randomized clinical trials, we included case reports, case series, and reviews. We found 1606 total articles related. The authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts for inclusion. CONCLUSION At present, despite the enormous medical effort for publishing several trials or case reports, we have not yet discovered a definitive therapy against the COVID-19 infection. This brief review aims to prompt identification of risk factors and main adverse effects in a systematic view related to therapy with partial evidence proposed to date.","Mora-Ramírez, Mauricio; Melgoza-Hernández, Paulina; Toledo-Ramírez, Sebastian Eduardo; Aranguré, Juan Manuel Mejía",Current medicinal chemistry,194,1

Aim To evaluate if type 1 diabetes affects the capacity of adolescents to exercise. Methods The study enrolled 37 adolescents in stage 2-4 of the Tanner scale, aged from 10 to 14 years, 21 with type 1 diabetes and 16 without any chronic diseases. All subjects performed an incremental submaximal exercise test in a cycle ergometer. At the end of every test stage, glycemia and blood lactate levels were measured. During the test, heart rate was monitored and the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was used to assess fatigue. Results The two groups displayed no significant differences in anthropometric variables. The response to exercise, as evaluated by Borg RPE (p = 0.829), maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) (p = 0.977), heart rate (p = 0.998), maximum load (p = 0.977), absolute load at lactate threshold (p = 0.377) and relative load at lactate threshold (p = 0.282), was also similar between the control and the type 1 diabetes group. Finally, there were no significant correlations between HbA1c levels, VO2max, duration of disease and pre-test glycemia levels. Conclusions We detected no significant differences in lactate threshold, VO2max and heart rate during exercise between healthy adolescents and non-sedentary adolescents with type I diabetes, indicating that both groups had similar physical fitness and, therefore, that type 1 diabetes is not an obstacle for physical activity.

BACKGROUND Lower contrast viscosity could result in more rapid coronary balloon deflation times. METHODS We performed a bench comparison of coronary balloon deflation times using 2 contrast agents with different viscosity (ioxaglate and iodixanol), 3 contrast dilutions, and 2 inflation syringe filling volumes. Ten identical pairs of coronary angioplasty balloons were used to conduct each comparison after balloon inflation to 12 atmospheres. Simultaneous deflations were performed under cineangiography. The time to full contrast extraction and the area of contrast remaining after 5 seconds of deflation (quantified by opaque pixel count) were compared between groups. RESULTS The mean time to full contrast extraction during balloon deflation was 8.3 ± 2.5 seconds for ioxaglate (lower viscosity) versus 10.1 ± 2.9 seconds for iodixanol (higher viscosity) (17.4% decrease, P = 0.005), with a 35.6% (P = 0.004) reduction in contrast area at 5 seconds. Compared to 1:1 ioxaglate-saline mixture, 1:2 and 1:3 ioxaglate/saline mixes resulted in 26.7% (P < 0.001) and 39.0% (P < 0.001) reduction in mean balloon deflation time, respectively, but at the expense of decreased balloon opacity. Filling the inflation syringe with 5 versus 15 ml of contrast/saline solution was associated with 7.5% decrease in balloon deflation time (P = 0.005), but no difference in contrast area at 5 seconds (P = 0.749). CONCLUSIONS Use of a lower viscosity contrast agent and higher contrast dilution significantly reduced coronary balloon deflation times, whereas use of lower syringe filling volume had a modest effect. Rapid coronary balloon deflation could improve the safety of interventional procedures.","Mogabgab, Owen; Patel, Vishal G; Michael, Tesfaldet T; Kotsia, Anna; Christopoulos, George; Banerjee, Subhash; Brilakis, Emmanouil S",Journal of interventional cardiology,194,1

This article reviews and summarizes recent outbreaks in the adult ICUs. RECENT FINDINGS Outbreaks of multidrug-resistant bacteria, fungi, and emerging viruses in ICUs from different countries are common. Outbreak investigation relies on epidemiologic methods, microbiologic studies, and molecular typing methods. Overuse of antibiotics, gaps in implementing infection prevention measures, and contaminated environment are common causes of ICU outbreaks. ICU staff awareness of and preparedness for such outbreaks are crucial for outbreak prevention and control. Specific infection control measures vary according to outbreak transmission mode and cause. SUMMARY Outbreaks remain a significant threat to healthcare systems. Proper implementation of infection prevention practices and judicious use of antibiotics are needed for outbreak prevention in adult ICUs. Surveillance, proper outbreak investigation, adherence to infection prevention and control measures, and thorough disinfection of contaminated areas are required to successfully manage outbreaks.","Al-Dorzi, Hasan M; Arabi, Yaseen M",Current opinion in infectious diseases,194,1

The present overview aims to describe the current role of the 2 most frequently used monitoring methods for evaluation brain function in the perioperative period, ie, electroencephalography (EEG) and brain oxygenation monitoring. Available evidence suggests that EEG-derived parameters give additional information about depth of anesthesia for optimizing anesthetic titration. The effects on reduction of drug consumption or recovery time are heterogeneous, but most studies show a reduction of recovery times if anesthesia is titrated along processed EEG. It has been hypothesized that future EEG-derived indices will allow a better understanding of the neurophysiological principles of anesthetic-induced alteration of consciousness instead of the probabilistic approach most often used nowadays.Brain oxygenation can be either measured directly in brain parenchyma via a surgical burr hole, estimated from the venous outflow of the brain via a catheter in the jugular bulb, or assessed noninvasively by near-infrared spectroscopy. The latter method has increasingly been accepted clinically due to its ease of use and increasing evidence that near-infrared spectroscopy-derived cerebral oxygen saturation levels are associated with neurological and/or general perioperative complications and increased mortality. Furthermore, a goal-directed strategy aiming to avoid cerebral desaturations might help to reduce these complications. Recent evidence points out that this technology may additionally be used to assess autoregulation of cerebral blood flow and thereby help to titrate arterial blood pressure to the individual needs and for bedside diagnosis of disturbed autoregulation.","Scheeren, Thomas W L; Kuizenga, Merel H; Maurer, Holger; Struys, Michel M R F; Heringlake, Matthias",Anesthesia and analgesia,194,1

We aim to evaluate whether stent retriever length impacts reperfusion rates in stroke thrombectomy. METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected thrombectomy database in which equal diameter (4 mm) stent retrievers were used as the first-line strategy for intracranial internal carotid or middle cerebral artery M1 or M2 occlusions along with a balloon guide catheter from June 2011 to March 2017. The population was dichotomized into long (Trevo 4×30 mm/Solitaire 4×40 mm) or short (Trevo 4×20 mm/Solitaire 4×20 mm) retrievers. The primary outcome was first-pass modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) 2b/3 reperfusion. RESULTS Of 1126 thrombectomies performed within the study period, 420 were included. Age, gender, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, ASPECTS, IV tissue plasminogen activator use, stroke etiology, occlusion site, time from last-known-normal to puncture, distribution of Trevo and Solitaire, and the use of newer generation local thromboaspiration devices were comparable between the long and short retrievers. The short retriever group had more frequent hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. First-pass mTICI 2b/3 reperfusion was more common in the long retriever group (62% vs 50%; P=0.01). Parenchymal hematomas type 2, subarachnoid hemorrhage, 90-day modified Rankin Scale score 0-2, and mortality were comparable. Multivariable analysis indicated that long retriever (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3 to 3.6; P=0.001), radiopaque device (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.4; P=0.003), and adjuvant local aspiration (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.3 to 4.3; P=0.003) were independently associated with first-pass reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS The use of longer stent retrievers is an independent predictor of first-pass mTICI 2b/3 reperfusion. First-pass reperfusion was also associated with the use of radiopaque devices and adjuvant local aspiration.","Haussen, Diogo C; Al-Bayati, Alhamza R; Grossberg, Jonathan A; Bouslama, Mehdi; Barreira, Clara; Bianchi, Nicolas; Frankel, Michael R; Nogueira, Raul G",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,194,16

What is the view of head and neck cancer patients (HNC) on this situation and which coping strategies were developed? MATERIAL & METHODS In study 1 PRIO asked 433 tumor patients regarding their impressions/fears during the lockdown between April 15 and May 15, 2020 (online, standardized questionnaire). In 2nd study 292 tumor patients reported their pandemic-induced perceived changes and coping strategies by established questionnaires (WHO-5, MLQ, GrAw-7). An analysis of the HNC-data obtained by standardized questionnaires was performed. RESULTS Study 1 had 91 HNC, study 2-84 HNC. Study 1 shows high stress levels for the majority of HNC (53,8 %). Personal fears regarding the own disease and therapies (39.6 %) are a central problem. The participants await physical (24.7 %) as well as psychological (21.3 %) consequences due to the pandemic and its current management. During the lockdown the isolation (banned visitors at any hospital) was discussed as critical main point by 58.5 % of HNC patients. Study 2 (after lockdown) underlined the mental stress caused by pandemic. Intensified relations within the families (58/100 points) as well as more intensive experience of nature and silence (58/60 points) are the most perceived changes in corona-times. HNC showed increased own inactivity (MLQ) and depressed well-being (WHO-5) and attention to the moment (GrAw-7). CONCLUSIONS HNC patients have had high burden and fears due to the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020.

Methods: Residents and students were invited to complete the Health Professionals' Attitudes Towards the Homeless Inventory (HPATHI) tool to assess attitudes, interests and confidence in working with the homeless population on a 5-point Likert scale. Comparisons were made between residents and pre-clerkship learners and between junior and senior residents using the Fisher exact test and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Responses were received from 114 of 220 ophthalmology residents (52%) and 315 of 534 (59%) pre-clerkship medical students. Ophthalmology residents had significantly more negative overall attitudes (pre-clerk median = 4.4, resident median = 4.1, both still indicating positive attitudes) and interests (pre-clerk median = 4.0, resident median = 3.3, residents with more neutral interests) towards working with the homeless population compared to pre-clerkship medical students. Using both statistical methods, beliefs were significantly more negative in 7 of 9 'Attitude' items, 5 of 5 'Interest' items and 1 of 4 'Confidence' items. Ophthalmology residents were only more positive in 1 of 4 of the 'Confidence' items. Attitudes were similar across PGY1-5 training years, except PGY4 and PGY5 residents were more negative than PGY1-3 residents on 1 of 5 'Interest' items. Conclusions: Ophthalmology residents have an at least neutral perception of individuals experiencing homelessness, while medical students have a more positive opinion.

However, compliance with exercise recommendations and the effect of exercise volume on symptom recovery require further investigation. PURPOSE To examine (1) if an 8-week aerobic exercise prescription, provided within 2 weeks of concussion, affects symptom severity or exercise volume; (2) whether prescription adherence, rather than randomized group assignment, reflects the actual effect of aerobic exercise in postconcussion recovery; and (3) the optimal volume of exercise associated with symptom resolution after 1 month of study. STUDY DESIGN Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS Individuals randomized to an exercise intervention (n = 17; mean age, 17.2 ± 2.0 years; 41% female; initially tested a mean of 11.3 ± 2.8 days after injury) or standard of care (n = 20; mean age, 16.8 ± 2.2 years; 50% female; initially tested a mean of 10.7 ± 3.2 days after injury) completed an aerobic exercise test within 14 days of injury. They returned for assessments 1 month and 2 months after the initial visit. The aerobic exercise group was instructed to exercise 5 d/wk, 20 min/d (100 min/wk), at a target heart rate based on an exercise test at the initial visit. Participants reported their exercise volume each week over the 8-week study period and reported symptoms at each study visit (initial, 1 month, 2 months). Because of low compliance in both groups, there was no difference in the volume of exercise between the 2 groups. RESULTS There were no significant symptom severity differences between the intervention and standard-of-care groups at the initial (median Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory, 15 [interquartile range = 10, 42] vs 20 [11, 35.5]; P = .26), 1-month (4 [0, 28] vs 5.5 [0.5, 21.5]; P = .96), or 2-month (6.5 [0, 27.5] vs 0 [0, 4]; P = .11) study visits. Exercise volume was similar between groups (median, 115 [54, 225] vs 88 [28, 230] min/wk for exercise intervention vs standard of care; P = .52). Regardless of group, those who exercised <100 min/wk reported significantly higher symptom severity at the 1-month evaluation compared with those who exercised ≥100 min/wk (median, 1.5 [0, 7.5] vs 12 [4, 28]; P = .03). Exercising ≥160 min/wk successfully discriminated between those with and those without symptoms 1 month after study commencement (classification accuracy, 81%; sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 78%). CONCLUSION Greater exercise volume was associated with lower symptom burden after 1 month of study, and an exercise volume >160 min/wk in the first month of the study was the threshold associated with symptom resolution after the first month of the study.

Given the rapid pace of scientific discovery and clinical data generated by the large number of people rapidly infected by SARS-CoV-2, clinicians need accurate evidence regarding effective medical treatments for this infection. Observations No proven effective therapies for this virus currently exist. The rapidly expanding knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. The most promising therapy is remdesivir. Remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but it is not US Food and Drug Administration approved and currently is being tested in ongoing randomized trials. Oseltamivir has not been shown to have efficacy, and corticosteroids are currently not recommended. Current clinical evidence does not support stopping angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis of this generation and, potentially, since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. The speed and volume of clinical trials launched to investigate potential therapies for COVID-19 highlight both the need and capability to produce high-quality evidence even in the middle of a pandemic. No therapies have been shown effective to date.","Sanders, James M; Monogue, Marguerite L; Jodlowski, Tomasz Z; Cutrell, James B",JAMA,194,8

Given its fastidious nature, this bacterium is difficult to recover and identify, particularly from locations colonized by normal bacterial flora. Standard PCR methods have been utilized for detection but are labor-intensive and not feasible for high-throughput testing. We evaluated a real-time PCR (rtPCR) method targeting the HPG-2 region of A. paragallinarum, and validated a high-throughput extraction for this assay. Using single-tube extraction, the rtPCR detected 4 A. paragallinarum (ATCC 29545T and 3 clinical) isolates with a limit of detection (LOD) of 10 cfu/mL and a PCR efficiency of 89-111%. Cross-reaction was not detected with 33 non-A. paragallinarum, all close relatives from the family Pasteurellaceae. Real-time PCR testing on extracts of 66 clinical samples (choana, sinus, or trachea) yielded 98.2% (35 of 36 on positives, 30 of 30 on negatives) agreement with conventional PCR. Duplicate samples tested in a 96-well format extraction in parallel with the single-tube method produced equivalent LOD on all A. paragallinarum isolates, and 96.8% agreement on 93 additional clinical samples extracted with both procedures.

However, the immunoevasive properties of VV have raised safety concerns. VV infection of APCs perturbs MHC class II-mediated Ag presentation. Exposure of human B cell lines to VV induced a substantial reduction in cellular expression of the class II chaperone, invariant chain (Ii), during the late stages (i.e., 8-10 h) of infection. Yet, cell viability and surface expression of MHC class II molecules were maintained up to 24 h after exposure to virus. Reductions in Ii and class II mRNA levels were detected as early as 6 h after VV infection of APCs. To examine whether VV was acting solely to disrupt host protein synthesis, B cells were treated with an inhibitor of translation, cycloheximide (CHX). Within 1 h of B cell CHX treatment, Ii protein expression decreased coupled with a loss of class II presentation. Analysis of Ii degradation in VV- or CHX-treated cells, revealed ongoing Ii proteolysis contributing to reduced steady-state Ii levels in these APC. Yet in contrast with CHX, VV infection of APCs altered lysosomal protease expression and Ii degradation. Virus infection induced cellular cathepsin L expression while reducing the levels of other lysosomal proteases. These results demonstrate that at late stages of VV infection, reductions in cellular Ii levels coupled with changes in lysosomal protease activity, contribute in part to defects in class II presentation.","Wang, Nan; Weber, Ekkehard; Blum, Janice S",Journal of immunology,194,5

Blood transfusion plays an important role in the success of KT. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is also used for desensitisation in ABO-incompatible KT and treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analysed red blood cell (RBC), platelet, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) usage and the number of TPE procedures performed during the hospitalisation of KT patients from 2002 to 2017 using the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Health Information Database. RESULTS A total of 18,331 KT patients were included in this study. The number of transfused RBCs continued to increase from 4,806 units in 2002-2005 to 12,390 units in 2014-2017. However, the average number of RBCs transfused per patient decreased from 2.17 to 1.79 units. Estimated platelet usage increased from 4,259 units in 2002-2005 to 11,519 units in 2014-2017, and the proportion of filtered platelets increased from 72.6% to 83.4% during the same period. There was a huge increase in the total number of FFP units used, from 2,255 units in 2002-2005 to 51,531 units in 2014-2017. The number of TPE procedures performed also increased from 296 to 6,479 during the same period. Patients with acute rejection accounted for 8.8% of all KT patients, and more RBC and FFP were used for these patients and a greater number of TPE procedures were performed compared to those who did not experience rejection.

As a result, prior research has failed to systematically investigate whether individuals' emotional and behavioral responses to perceived rejection differ as a function of the role of the potential rejector. In the present study, a total of 481 participants read two scenarios describing hypothetical situations in which rejection by a specific individual (i.e., significant other, friend, or acquaintance) was ambiguous. After each scenario, participants rated the extent to which they would be likely to anticipate (a) experiencing various negative emotions (e.g., upset) and (b) engaging in various behavioral responses (i.e., act friendly, retaliate, complain, avoid) to the potential rejector. Overall, the potential of being rejected by another person with whom one has a close and valued relationship (i.e., a significant other and, to a lesser degree, a friend) was associated with heightened negative emotion and a heightened likelihood of engaging in an active response, either prosocial (i.e., act friendly) or antisocial (i.e., retaliate or complain). In contrast, potential rejection by an acquaintance was associated with relatively little negative emotion and relatively little desire to engage the other (i.e., avoid). In sum, the participants' relationship with specific individuals was found to influence both the intensity of their anticipated negative emotional response to ambiguous rejection and the pattern of their anticipated behavioral response to the potential rejectors.","Jones, Tucker L; Barnett, Mark A",The Journal of general psychology,194,23

It is known that environmental and psychosocial factors are of importance. Some receptors in the Transient Receptor Potential family elicit the same symptoms when stimulated, as reported by those suffering from building-related symptoms. The aim of this study was to compare capsaicin sensitivity between people with and without skin symptoms. A second aim was to investigate perceived stress among individuals with different levels of capsaicin sensitivity. METHODS People referred to an occupational health care unit and judged to have building-related symptoms by a physician answered a questionnaire regarding their symptoms. Solutions with different capsaicin concentrations were applied to participants' nasolabial folds. Self-reported stress and burnout were assessed using two questionnaires: the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ). RESULTS We found that people who reported facial erythema or itching, stinging, tight or burning facial skin were more sensitive than those without symptoms and similarities with Sensitive Skin are discussed. We also found that participants who reacted to the lowest capsaicin concentrations scored significantly higher on scales for stress and burnout.

Adult patients may exhibit what is called ""COVID toes"" later in their course of illness. Noteworthy is that COVID toes may be the only symptom in otherwise asymptomatic young adults and children. CASE We present experience with an adult female patient residing in the United States with presumed COVID-19 infection who was self-isolating with illness not severe enough to require hospitalization. COVID toes were one symptom experienced as a part of her illness. Because COVID toes are usually seen in the recovery phase of COVID-19, and often in patients with less severe cases, many providers are unfamiliar with this new symptom. CONCLUSION Familiarity with COVID toes will help foot care providers to identify patients who may not have been diagnosed with COVID-19 but could still be infectious and need to be isolated. COVID toe signs may be subtle and often mimic other conditions such as chilblains/pernio, thus a thorough history and physical examination are required.","Beuscher, Tara L; Andrews, Sarah E","Journal of wound, ostomy, and continence nursing : official publication of The Wound, Ostomy and Continence Nurses Society",194,9

OBJECTIVES We evaluated studies that included participants 16 years of age and older who were admitted to the ICU and required treatment with HFNC. We assessed the safety and efficacy of HFNC compared with comparator interventions in terms of treatment failure, mortality, adverse events, duration of respiratory support, hospital and ICU length of stay, respiratory effects, patient-reported outcomes, and costs of treatment. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, Web of Science, proceedings from four conferences, and clinical trials registries; and we handsearched reference lists of relevant studies. We conducted searches from January 2000 to March 2016 and reran the searches in December 2016. We added four new studies of potential interest to a list of 'Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into formal review findings during the review update. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled studies with a parallel or cross-over design comparing HFNC use in adult ICU patients versus other forms of non-invasive respiratory support (low-flow oxygen via nasal cannulae or mask, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS We included 11 studies with 1972 participants. Participants in six studies had respiratory failure, and in five studies required oxygen therapy after extubation. Ten studies compared HFNC versus low-flow oxygen devices; one of these also compared HFNC versus CPAP, and another compared HFNC versus BiPAP alone. Most studies reported randomization and allocation concealment inadequately and provided inconsistent details of outcome assessor blinding. We did not combine data for CPAP and BiPAP comparisons with data for low-flow oxygen devices; study data were insufficient for separate analysis of CPAP and BiPAP for most outcomes. For the primary outcomes of treatment failure (1066 participants; six studies) and mortality (755 participants; three studies), investigators found no differences between HFNC and low-flow oxygen therapies (risk ratio (RR), Mantel-Haenszel (MH), random-effects 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.27; and RR, MH, random-effects 0.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.06, respectively). We used the GRADE approach to downgrade the certainty of this evidence to low because of study risks of bias and different participant indications. Reported adverse events included nosocomial pneumonia, oxygen desaturation, visits to general practitioner for respiratory complications, pneumothorax, acute pseudo-obstruction, cardiac dysrhythmia, septic shock, and cardiorespiratory arrest. However, single studies reported adverse events, and we could not combine these findings; one study reported fewer episodes of oxygen desaturation with HFNC but no differences in all other reported adverse events. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for adverse events to low because of limited data. Researchers noted no differences in ICU length of stay (mean difference (MD), inverse variance (IV), random-effects 0.15, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.34; four studies; 770 participants), and we downgraded quality to low because of study risks of bias and different participant indications. We found no differences in oxygenation variables: partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (MD, IV, random-effects 7.31, 95% CI -23.69 to 41.31; four studies; 510 participants); PaO2 (MD, IV, random-effects 2.79, 95% CI -5.47 to 11.05; three studies; 355 participants); and oxygen saturation (SpO2) up to 24 hours (MD, IV, random-effects 0.72, 95% CI -0.73 to 2.17; four studies; 512 participants). Data from two studies showed that oxygen saturation measured after 24 hours was improved among those treated with HFNC (MD, IV, random-effects 1.28, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.55; 445 participants), but this difference was small and was not clinically significant. Along with concern about risks of bias and differences in participant indications, review authors noted a high level of unexplained statistical heterogeneity in oxygenation effect estimates, and we downgraded the quality of evidence to very low. Meta-analysis of three comparable studies showed no differences in carbon dioxide clearance among those treated with HFNC (MD, IV, random-effects -0.75, 95% CI -2.04 to 0.55; three studies; 590 participants). Two studies reported no differences in atelectasis; we did not combine these findings. Data from six studies (867 participants) comparing HFNC versus low-flow oxygen showed no differences in respiratory rates up to 24 hours according to type of oxygen delivery device (MD, IV, random-effects -1.51, 95% CI -3.36 to 0.35), and no difference after 24 hours (MD, IV, random-effects -2.71, 95% CI -7.12 to 1.70; two studies; 445 participants). Improvement in respiratory rates when HFNC was compared with CPAP or BiPAP was not clinically important (MD, IV, random-effects -0.89, 95% CI -1.74 to -0.05; two studies; 834 participants). Results showed no differences in patient-reported measures of comfort according to oxygen delivery devices in the short term (MD, IV, random-effects 0.14, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.93; three studies; 462 participants) and in the long term (MD, IV, random-effects -0.36, 95% CI -3.70 to 2.98; two studies; 445 participants); we downgraded the certainty of this evidence to low. Six studies measured dyspnoea on incomparable scales, yielding inconsistent study data. No study in this review provided data on positive end-expiratory pressure measured at the pharyngeal level, work of breathing, or cost comparisons of treatment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We were unable to demonstrate whether HFNC was a more effective or safe oxygen delivery device compared with other oxygenation devices in adult ICU patients. Meta-analysis could be performed for few studies for each outcome, and data for comparisons with CPAP or BiPAP were very limited. In addition, we identified some risks of bias among included studies, differences in patient groups, and high levels of statistical heterogeneity for some outcomes, leading to uncertainty regarding the results of our analysis. Consequently, evidence is insufficient to show whether HFNC provides safe and efficacious respiratory support for adult ICU patients.","Corley, Amanda; Rickard, Claire M; Aitken, Leanne M; Johnston, Amy; Barnett, Adrian; Fraser, John F; Lewis, Sharon R; Smith, Andrew F",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,194,1

Seed germination is a crucial stage in the plant life cycle and is particularly important for turf establishment and management. Experiments have confirmed that melatonin can be a potential regulator signal in seeds. To determine the effect of exogenous melatonin administration and explore the its potential in regulating seed growth, we studied the concentrations of several hormones and performed a transcriptome analysis of zoysia seeds after the application of melatonin. The total antioxidant capacity determination results showed that melatonin treatment could significantly improve the antioxidant capacity of zoysia seeds. The transcriptome analysis indicated that several of the regulatory pathways were involved in antioxidant activity and hormone activity. The hormones concentrations determination results showed that melatonin treatment contributed to decreased levels of cytokinin, abscisic acid and gibberellin in seeds, but had no significant effect on the secretion of auxin in early stages. Melatonin is able to affect the expression of IAA (indoleacetic acid) response genes. In addition, melatonin influences the other hormones by its synergy with other hormones.

METHODS Retrospective single institutional analysis was performed on the clinical and imaging data of patients who underwent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and ASL-MRI after endovascular flow diversion for cerebral aneurysms. Pseudo-continuous ASL-MRI was performed with post-label delays of 1525-1800 ms. Intra-aneurysmal ""trapped labelled spins"" (TLS)-related hypersignal, as seen on cerebral blood flow (CBF)-weighted maps of ASL-MRI, was investigated. Intermodality equivalence with DSA [O'Kelly-Marotta (OKM) grading for occlusion], 3D-TOF-MRA, and 3D spin-echo T1-weighted (""black-blood"") images was assessed. RESULTS Ten cases were included. ""TLS"" signal was demonstrable in 7/8 (87.5%) of the DSA-visible flow-diverted aneurysms (OKM grade B3, n = 6; OKM grade A3, n = 2). No TLS was seen in both OKM-D (excluded) aneurysms. TLS was not visualised in an OKM-B3 aneurysm with < 3 mm opacifying remnant. 3D-TOF-MRA and ASL-MRI were discordant at 5 instances (45.4%; TOF-MRA false negative, n = 4; false positive, n = 1). Loss of flow void on black-blood images corresponded to the absence of TLS and vice versa in all cases but one. CONCLUSION ""Trapped labelled spins""-related signal on ASL-MRI occurs in patent large aneurysms that have undergone successful endovascular flow diversion. This phenomenon likely represents an interplay of a multitude of haemodynamic factors including decelerated intra-aneurysmal inflow and outflow restriction. Serial intra-saccular TLS signal changes may hold diagnostic value, including contexts where 3D-TOF-MRA interpretation becomes dubious. ""Trapped labelled spins""-related signal as a non-invasive proxy marker of aneurysm patency can possibly obviate unnecessary DSA.","Kulanthaivelu, Karthik; Peer, Sameer; Biswas, Shamick; Prasad, Chandrajit; Saini, Jitender; Pendharkar, Hima S; Gupta, Arun Kumar; Ramalingaiah, Arvinda Hanumanthapura; Srinivas, Dwarakanath",Neuroradiology,194,1

OBJECTIVE To evaluate morphological changes to the CS after FDS deployment and their relationship with the rate of occlusion of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS A cohort of 183 patients with CS aneurysms were treated by deployment of Pipeline® FDS (Medtronic Inc, Dublin, Ireland). Their CSs were classified as type U, V, C, or S, depending on morphology. The posterior and anterior bend angles were measured on strict lateral cerebral angiogram with digital subtraction before FDS deployment, immediately after deployment, and at 6 mo. Differences between angles were analyzed to identify any correlations with rates of aneurysm occlusion, using the O'Kelly-Marotta classification. RESULTS FDS deployment was associated with immediate changes in CS morphology. The mean anterior angle increased from 3.97 ± 25.06° to 22.05 ± 25.18° (P < .001) and the mean posterior angle increased from 71.98 ± 31.27° to 79.43 ± 31.80° (P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed a progressive, statistically significant increase in frequency of complete (grade D) occlusion at 6-mo follow-up with increasing anterior bend angle (prevalence ratios (PR) = 1.42 for increases between 5.3° and 12°, P = .017; PR = 1.56 for increases between 12.1° and 27.6°, P = .002; PR = 1.83 for increases >27.6°, P < .001, all vs increases <5.3°). CONCLUSION FDS deployment induces changes in CS morphology.

For 292 of the 309 procedures, intraarterial chemotherapy was administered; the remaining 17 procedures were for vascular malformations, stroke, tumor embolization, and intracranial hemorrhage. The rate of neurological complications was 0.0%. The rate of nonneurological complications was 2.9%: 7 cases of contrast allergy or bronchospasm, 1 groin hematoma (body weight 7 kg), and 1 transient femoral artery occlusion (body weight 10.8 kg). The rate of radiographic complications was 1.3%: 1 case of transient asymptomatic intraarterial dissection and 3 cases of asymptomatic vasospasm. Postprocedural MRI was performed for 33.3% of patients with no evidence of ischemia. There were no delayed complications. Mean follow-up time was 16.6 months. No association was found between complications and age, duration of anesthesia, number of vessels catheterized, size of the sheath, or diagnostic versus interventional procedures. Despite a trend toward a higher rate of complications for patients who weighed less than 15 kg, this finding was not significant (p = 0.35). CONCLUSIONS The rate of complications for CA in young children is comparable to rates reported for older children and lower than rates reported for adults. When appropriately indicated, CA should not be omitted from the therapeutic strategy of children younger than 36 months of age.","Hoffman, Caitlin E; Santillan, Alejandro; Rotman, Lauren; Gobin, Y Pierre; Souweidane, Mark M",Journal of neurosurgery.

The recent Call to Action from the American College of Sports Medicine has promoted ""innovative strategies to promote PA during the COVID-19 pandemic"". We aimed to identify individual-level factors that protected against declines in PA levels amid the COVID-19 restrictions. METHODS We utilized the Pennington Biomedical COVID-19 Health Behaviors Survey for our analyses and used mixed-effect linear and generalized linear models to estimate the effects of individual-level factors on changes in PA levels during the COVID-19 restrictions. RESULTS Participants (n=4,376) provided information on PA behaviors before and during the COVID-19 shutdown. Overall, PA levels declined by a mean (SD) of 112 (1,460) MET minutes/week during the COVID-19 shutdown; however, changes in PA were heterogeneous, with 55% of the participants reporting increases in or maintenance of PA during that time. Several social and demographic factors were significantly related to declines in PA, including high pre-pandemic PA levels, living alone (difference=118 MET minutes/week), low household income (difference between the highest and lowest income group=363 MET minutes/week), COVID-19-related changes in income (difference=110 MET minutes/week), and loss of employment (difference=168 MET minutes/week). Substitution of pre-pandemic gym attendance with the purchase and use of home exercise equipment or exercise through virtual fitness platforms promoted increases in PA during the COVID-19 shutdown. CONCLUSIONS While promoting PA through the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to consider demographic factors, which greatly influence health behaviors and implementation of, and access to, replacement behaviors. Promotion of such strategies could help maintain PA levels during potential future stay-at-home orders.","Fearnbach, S Nicole; Flanagan, Emily W; Höchsmann, Christoph; Beyl, Robbie A; Altazan, Abby D; Martin, Corby K; Redman, Leanne M",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,194,28

This report describes the initial COVID-19 experience of the single healthcare system serving Jackson County, Mississippi. The intent of this retrospective review of COVID-19 hospitalized patients was to identify any characteristics or interventions amenable to improving care management and clinical outcomes for patients within our community hospital. METHODS All hospitalized patients 18 years of age and older in our health system with positive tests for COVID-19 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 [SARS CoV-2]) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction between March 15 and April 10, 2020 are included in this retrospective observational report. RESULTS During the study period, 158 patients of the 1384 tested (11.4%) were positive for COVID-19 infection. Of the 158 patients, 41 (26%) were hospitalized, with 17 (41%) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The remaining 24 patients did not require ICU admission. The mean age of the 158 COVID-19-positive patients was 55 years (range 2-103). Obesity was noted in 68% of the hospitalized patients, including 13 (54%) of the non-ICU patients and 15 (88%) of the ICU patients. All 9 deceased patients were obese. Twelve of 17 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and 3 patients received only high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. Only 25% (3 of 12) of the IMV patients were successfully extubated during the study period. The median duration on IMV was 17 days (range 4-35). The mortality in the 158 COVID-19-positive patients was 5.7% (9 of 158). None of the 24 non-ICU patients died. The ICU mortality rate was 53% (9 of 17). CONCLUSIONS This report describes a community hospital experience with COVID-19. Patient outcome was comparable to that reported at larger centers. Obesity was a major comorbidity and correlated with adverse outcomes. Amidst the initial wave of COVID-19 with high demand for inpatient treatment, it is reassuring that appropriate care can be provided in a community health system.","Babar, Ijlal; Ekenna, Okechukwu; Clarkson, Maggie Ramsey; Boudreaux, Daralyn; Bennett, William; Roth, Randy",Southern medical journal,194,1

The theoretical requirements for phase separation are fairly minimal, and there is growing evidence that analogous phenomena occur at other scales in biology. Here we examine colony formation in the nematode C. elegans as a possible example of phase separation by a population of organisms. The population density of worms determines whether a colony will form in a thresholded fashion, and a simple two-compartment ordinary differential equation model correctly predicts the threshold. Furthermore, small, round colonies sometimes fuse to form larger, round colonies, and a phenomenon akin to Ostwald ripening - a coarsening process seen in many systems that undergo phase separation - also occurs. These findings support the emerging view that the principles of microscopic phase separation can also apply to collective behaviors of living organisms.","Chen, Yuping; Ferrell, James E",Nature communications,194,1

Therefore, implanting materials with well-characterized tissue responses provides the greatest chance of 'one-hit' surgical successes, without repeated interventions to replace, repair or remove non-compliant biomaterials. Six synthetic meshes were implanted subcutaneously in a rat model to deduce and quantify modulations in host response, based on material fabrication variables. The materials consisted of knitting variations of polypropylene (PP), polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) and polyglycolic acid (PGA) yarns and were implanted for 2, 5, 7, 14 and 28 days before fixation and both semi- and fully quantitative histopathology. In a subcutaneous niche, material weight did not influence foreign body response. PET stimulated earlier inflammation than PP and PGA, which normalized over 28 days. Multifilament meshes recruited foreign body giant cells, which were largely absent from monofilaments. Using CD68, PGA was demonstrated to be the greatest leukocyte-activating polymer at a number of the time points analysed. This research therefore highlights that underlying polymer composition may be more over-arching in deciding the inflammatory properties of surgical meshes, based on increased macrophagic responses to PGA vs alternative base polymers of comparable weights and porosities.

We hypothesized that the left atrium could be accessed directly through the posterior chest wall under imaging guidance. METHODS AND RESULTS We tested percutaneous transthoracic left atrial access in 12 animals (10 pigs and 2 sheep) under real-time magnetic resonance imaging or x-ray fluoroscopy plus C-arm computed tomographic guidance. The pleural space was insufflated with CO2 to displace the lung, an 18F sheath was delivered to the left atrium, and the left atrial port was closed using an off-the-shelf nitinol cardiac occluder. Animals were survived for a minimum of 7 days. The left atrial was accessed, and the port was closed successfully in 12/12 animals. There was no procedural mortality and only 1 hemodynamically insignificant pericardial effusion was observed at follow-up. We also successfully performed the procedure on 3 human cadavers. A simulated trajectory to the left atrium was present in all of 10 human cardiac computed tomographic angiograms analyzed. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous transthoracic left atrial access is feasible without instrumenting the left ventricular myocardium. In our experience, magnetic resonance imaging offers superb visualization of anatomic structures with the ability to monitor and address complications in real-time, although x-ray guidance seems feasible. Clinical translation seems realistic based on human cardiac computed tomographic analysis and cadaver testing. This technique could provide a direct nonsurgical access route for future transcatheter mitral implantation.","Rogers, Toby; Ratnayaka, Kanishka; Schenke, William H; Sonmez, Merdim; Kocaturk, Ozgur; Mazal, Jonathan R; Chen, Marcus Y; Flugelman, Moshe Y; Troendle, James F; Faranesh, Anthony Z; Lederman, Robert J",Circulation.

METHODOLOGY Three hundred and eight patients were randomly assigned into two equal groups according to whether occlusal reduction was done or not (n=154). For all patients, root canal treatment was carried out in two visits without intracanal medication. Patients assessed their pain using the 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) 6h, 12h 24h, 48h after the first visit (Postinstrumentation) and 6h and 12h following root canal filling (Postobturation). Patients, also, recorded their medication intake (Sham or analgesic) postinstrumentation and postobturation; patients initially received a sham capsule, but, if pain persisted, an analgesic was prescribed. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney U-test, Friedman's test, Wilcoxon's rank test and Chi2 (χ2 ) test. The Relative Risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for binary data. RESULTS Occlusal reduction was associated with less pain intensity than no occlusal reduction at 12h and 24h postinstrumentation (p<0.05). Pain intensity significantly and gradually decreased with both groups at all postinstrumentation and postobturation timepoints compared to preoperative pain (p<0.05). The RR of moderate-to-severe pain was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.91) 12h postinstrumentation and the RR of pain incidence, regardless of its level, was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.92) 24h postinstrumentation. There was no significant difference in medication intake (sham or analgesic) between groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS Occlusal reduction was effective in reducing the intensity of postoperative pain 12h and 24h after root canal instrumentation in the first visit in patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with sensitivity to percussion. Occlusal reduction lowered the risk of moderate-to-severe pain by about 40% 12h postinstrumentation and the overall risk of pain by 25% 24h postinstrumentation; yet, it did not affect medication intake.","Ahmed, Y E; Emara, R S; Sarhan, S M; El Boghdadi, R M; El-Bayoumi, M A A; El-Far, H M M; Sabet, N E; Abou El-Nasr, H M; Gawdat, S I; Amin, S A W",International endodontic journal,194,1

The initial search identified 448 articles, but only 4 of these articles met basic criteria necessary to assess real-world transfer. Key factors regarding the study design, learner characteristics and training environment of these studies are considered. In a relatively new area of research, the findings from these 4 articles are encouraging and provide initial support for the notion that skills training in a VE can improve real-world performance in sports. However, for a wider uptake of VEs in sports training, it is important that more research demonstrates real-world transfer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty patients with various neurological diseases participated in this study. In addition to 3D-PCASL, 15 patients received GE-DSC and the others received SE-DSC imaging on a 3 Tesla scanner. A cortical gray matter (GM) to white matter (WM) and a thalamus (TM) to WM CBF ratio were determined from each perfusion scan. In addition, histograms of relative CBF distributions were obtained from each method for comparison. RESULTS Significant correlations of CBF ratios were found between 3D-PCASL and the two DSC methods (P < 0.05). The 3D-PCASL resulted in GM/WM CBF ratios similar to SE-DSC but significantly smaller than GE-DSC (P = 2.3 × 10(-7) ). TM/WM CBF ratio obtained by 3D-PCASL was significantly smaller than those by GE- and SE-DSC (P = 4.1 × 10(-7) and 1.2 × 10(-6) , respectively). The histogram of relative CBF maps obtained from SE-DSC, after applied spatial smoothing, agreed well with that from 3D-PCASL. CONCLUSION This study suggested that perfusion images obtained from 3D-PCASL exhibited significant correlations with DSC-MRI, with greater microvascular weighting like SE-DSC.","Wong, Alex M; Yan, Feng-Xian; Liu, Ho-Ling",Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,194,1

Very few alternatives to amputation are available, mainly the resection of a part or the totality of the calcaneal bone. Calcanectomies were advanced as limb-sparing procedures in patients with heel osteomyelitis. However, there is a lack of pooled quantitative evidence on their efficacy and complications. OBJECTIVES The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the primary outcome of healing rates following partial (PC) and total calcanectomies (TC) in treating calcaneal osteomyelitis due to diabetic heel ulcers. Additionally, secondary outcomes such as secondary TC following PC, secondary below knee amputation (BKA), mortality and the change in the ambulation status were analyzed. METHODS Medline, Scopus, Web of science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched since inception. All types of study design were included. Single case report studies and studies reporting osteomyelitis due to other etiologies than DFU were excluded. RESULTS Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria comprising 295 patients with 300 calcanectomies (270 PC and 30 TC). With a mean follow-up period of 29.3±17.7 months, the weighted results were as follows: a) the osteomyelitis healing rate was of 80% (95% CI=0.728 to 0.861, I2=48.3%), b) the rate of secondary total calcanectomy was of 5.4% (95% CI=0.022 to 0.097, I2=7.5%), c) the rate of secondary BKA was of 17.1% (95% CI=0.111 to 0.241, I2=50.6%) with no difference between subgroups of TC and PC, and d) the combined mortality rate of both calcanectomies was of 13.4% (95% CI=0.064 to 0.224, I2=73.6%); however, significant higher mortality was found following TC compared to PC (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION Partial and total calcanectomies were found to yield very good healing rates with acceptable complication frequencies. When compared to the reported outcomes of below and above-knee amputations in the literature, calcanectomies could be fairly considered as good alternatives to above ankle amputations.","Yammine, Kaissar; El-Alam, Anthony; Assi, Chahine",Foot and ankle surgery : official journal of the European Society of Foot and Ankle Surgeons,194,17

Collectively, and to a significant extent in partnership with the sun, microbes are the life support system of the biosphere. This necessitates their due consideration in decisions that are taken by individuals and families in everyday life, as well as by individuals and responsible bodies at all levels and stages of community, national and planetary health assessment, planning, and the formulation of pertinent policies. However, unlike other subjects having a pervasive impact upon humankind, such as financial affairs, health, and transportation, of which there is a widespread understanding, knowledge of relevant microbial activities, how they impact our lives, and how they may be harnessed for the benefit of humankind - microbiology literacy - is lacking in the general population, and in the subsets thereof that constitute the decision makers. Choices involving microbial activity implications are often opaque, and the information available is sometimes biased and usually incomplete, and hence creates considerable uncertainty. As a consequence, even evidence-based 'best' decisions, not infrequently lead to unpredicted, unintended, and sometimes undesired outcomes. We therefore contend that microbiology literacy in society is indispensable for informed personal decisions, as well as for policy development in government and business, and for knowledgeable input of societal stakeholders in such policymaking. An understanding of key microbial activities is as essential for transitioning from childhood to adulthood as some subjects currently taught at school, and must therefore be acquired during general education. Microbiology literacy needs to become part of the world citizen job description. To facilitate the attainment of microbiology literacy in society, through its incorporation into education curricula, we propose here a basic teaching concept and format that are adaptable to all ages, from pre-school to high school, and places key microbial activities in the contexts of how they affect our everyday lives, of relevant Grand Challenges facing humanity and planet Earth, and of sustainability and Sustainable Development Goals. We exhort microbiologists, microbiological learned societies and microbiology-literate professionals, to participate in and contribute to this initiative by helping to evolve the basic concept, developing and seeking funding to develop child-friendly, appealing teaching tools and materials, enhancing its impact and, most importantly, convincing educators, policy makers, business leaders and relevant governmental and non-governmental agencies to support and promote this initiative.

To reduce the current rate of ventilator-induced lung injury requires ventilator settings that are patient-, time-, and disease-specific. A common lung protective strategy is to optimise the level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) through a recruitment manoeuvre to prevent alveolar collapse at the end of expiration and to improve gas exchange through recruitment of additional alveoli. However, this process can subject parts of the lung to excessively high pressures or volumes. This research significantly extends and more robustly validates a previously developed pulmonary mechanics model to predict lung mechanics throughout recruitment manoeuvres. In particular, the process of recruitment is more thoroughly investigated and the impact of the inclusion of expiratory data when estimating peak inspiratory pressure is assessed. Data from the McREM trial and CURE pilot trial were used to test model predictive capability and assumptions. For PEEP changes of up to and including 14 cmH2O, the parabolic model was shown to improve peak inspiratory pressure prediction resulting in less than 10% absolute error in the CURE cohort and 16% in the McREM cohort. The parabolic model also better captured expiratory mechanics than the exponential model for both cohorts.","Morton, Sophie E; Knopp, Jennifer L; Chase, J Geoffrey; Möller, Knut; Docherty, Paul; Shaw, Geoffrey M; Tawhai, Merryn",Annals of biomedical engineering,194,31

We undertook a study, in a sheep model of acute brain injury, to assess a new non-invasive brain oximeter. The monitor uses the principles of pulse oximetry to record a pulse and oxygen levels. Methods We studied 8 sheep. An acute increase in intracranial pressure was induced with an injection of blood into the cranial vault. The temporal changes in the brain oximeter, intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure were recorded. Simultaneous conventional skin pulse oximetry was also recorded to assess the possible influence of skin blood flow on the brain oximeter signal. Results At baseline, a pulsatile waveform consistent with the brain circulation was obtained in 7 animals. The baseline brain pulse was quite distinct from the simultaneous conventional skin pulse and similar in shape to a central venous pressure waveform. Injection of blood into the cranial vault triggered an immediate increase in intracranial pressure and fall in cerebral perfusion pressure, by 60-s cerebral perfusion pressure recovered. The brain oximeter oxygen levels demonstrated similar changes with an immediate fall and recovery by 60 s. Periods of high intracranial pressure were also associated with high-frequency oscillations in the brain pulse waveform; there was, however, no change in the conventional skin pulse oximeter pulse waveform. Conclusion The brain oximeter detected acute changes in both oxygen levels and the brain pulse waveform following an increase in intracranial pressure levels. The brain oximeter could assist clinicians in the management of acute brain injury.","Dixon, Barry; Turner, Renee; Christou, Chris",Medical devices,194,32

DESIGN Longitudinal study of patients undergoing LAGB (n=15) and RYGB (n=28) who were studied before surgery and at 2, 12, 26 and 52 weeks afterwards. MEASUREMENTS Fasting blood samples were drawn at each visit. Postprandial blood samples were also obtained before surgery and at 26 and 52 weeks. Samples were assayed for peptide YY (PYY), ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose, insulin, leptin, thyrotropic hormone, free T(4) and free T(3). RESULTS At 1 year there was greater weight loss in RYGB compared with LAGB patients (30 vs 15%), but final body mass index was similar (34 vs 33 kg m(-2)). At week 52, area under the curve (AUC) for PYY in RYGB subjects was greater than LAGB (P<0.01). GLP-1 levels at 30 min after meal were threefold greater after RYGB compared with LAGB (P<0.001). Conversely, ghrelin AUC increased after LAGB at week 52 (P<0.05) but tended to decrease after RYGB. Fasting glucose, insulin, and leptin and homeostasis model of assessment (HOMA-IR) decreased in both groups over time but were significantly lower at week 52 after RYGB compared with LAGB. The change in leptin correlated significantly with weight loss in LAGB (r=0.86) and RYGB (r=0.77), however, HOMA-IR correlated significantly with weight loss only in LAGB (r=0.78), and not RYGB (r=0.15). There was a significant decrease in free T(3) (P<0.01) after RYGB. CONCLUSIONS Differences in levels of gut hormones may play a role in promoting greater weight loss and insulin sensitivity after RYGB compared with LAGB, however, weight loss may be limited by decreases in free T(3) and leptin.","Korner, J; Inabnet, W; Febres, G; Conwell, I M; McMahon, D J; Salas, R; Taveras, C; Schrope, B; Bessler, M",International journal of obesity,194,12

This review discusses racial-ethnic differences in COVID-19 related outcomes with an emphasis on the social determinants of health that are responsible for these disparities. RECENT FINDINGS Higher hospitalizations and deaths have been reported amongst minority individuals after a COVID-19 infection. Cardiovascular disease and its risk factors are also more common in minority populations and negatively impact clinical outcomes after a COVID-19 illness. The racial disparities seen after COVID-19 infections appear to be driven by multiple preexisting comorbidities, adverse socioeconomic conditions, and lack of access to healthcare. These disadvantages were present before the COVID-19 pandemic. To effectively reduce disparities in outcomes of COVID-19 and the impact of the virus on minority communities, a multifaceted approach will be needed. SUMMARY Government-backed policies that foster health equity and promote easily accessible testing and fair distribution of COVID-19 therapies and vaccines are necessary to successfully combat racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes.","Aleligne, Yeabsra Kefyalew; Appiah, Duke; Ebong, Imo A",Current opinion in cardiology,194,1

Twenty-seven studies met the review criteria, these were in 17 countries and used 8 types of mercury biomarker. Studies of birth weight (total = 27) involving populations with high levels of mercury exposure, non-linear methods, or identified as high quality were more likely to report an association with mercury, but overall results were inconsistent. Most studies reported no strong evidence of association between mercury and birth length (n = 14) or head circumference (n = 14).

HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) are a vulnerable population with regards to the introduction, spread and clinical consequences of (newly introduced) STIs. After the introduction of combination antiretroviral treatment (cART), the incidence of sexually acquired hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced anal cancers have significantly increased among HIV-positive MSM. The introduction and expansion of HCV is the result of increased sexual risk behaviour and sexually acquired mucosal trauma within large interconnected networks of HIV-positive MSM in particular. With the availability of cART, postexposure and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PEP and PrEP) and direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for HCV, less concern for HIV and HCV might require a new approach to develop effective behavioural intervention strategies among MSM. The marked rise in HPV-induced anal cancers can be ascribed to the long-term immunologic defects in an ageing population affected by HIV. More evidence with regards to effective treatment options for anal dysplastic lesions and the usefulness of anal malignancy screening programmes is urgently needed.

Contact tracing is crucial for effective disease control and is normally carried out by public health teams. Contact tracing staff are provided with rapid intensive training but are operating in a dynamic environment where processes and advice are adapting continuously. Real-time data is essential to inform strategy, coordinate interconnected processes, and respond to needs . Given that many contact tracers have been newly recruited or redeployed, they may not have significant experience in healthcare and may experience difficulties in managing the anxieties and emotional distress of the public. Aim: (i) identify emerging needs and issues and feed this information back to the Health Service Executive for updates to the COVID-19 Contact Management Programme (CMP); (ii) understand the psychological impact on contact tracers and inform the development of appropriate supports. Methods: We will use a mixed-methods approach. A brief online survey will be administered at up to three time points during 2021 to measure emotional exhaustion, anxiety, general health, and stress of contact tracing staff, identify tracing systems or processes issues, as well as issues of concern and confusion among the public. Interviews will also be conducted with a subset of participants to achieve a more in-depth understanding of these experiences. Observations may be conducted in contact tracing centres to document processes, practices, and explore any local contextual issues. Impact: Regular briefs arising from this research with data, analysis, and recommendations will aim to support the work of the CMP to identify problems and implement solutions. We will deliver regular feedback on systems issues; challenges; and the psychological well-being of contact tracing staff.","O'Donovan, Róisín; Buckley, Claire; Crowley, Philip; Fulham-McQuillan, Hugh; Gilmore, Brynne; Martin, Jennifer; McAuliffe, Eilish; Moore, Gemma; Nicholson, Emma; Ní Shé, Éidín; O'Hara, Mary Clare; Segurado, Ricardo; Sweeney, Mary Rose; Wall, Patrick; De Brún, Aoife",HRB open research,194,17

METHODS CTPA was performed on 200 patients with suspected PE. Patients were assigned to two protocol groups: protocol A, fixed 80 ml contrast agent; protocol B used a patient-specific approach. The mean cross-sectional opacification profile of 8 central and 11 peripheral pulmonary arteries and veins was measured and the arteriovenous contrast ratio (AVCR) calculated. Protocols were compared using Mann-Whitney U non-parametric statistics. Jack-knife alternative free-response receiver-operating characteristic (JAFROC) analyses assessed diagnostic efficacy. Interobserver variations were investigated using kappa methods. RESULTS A number of pulmonary arteries demonstrated increases in opacification (P < 0.03) for protocol B compared to A, whilst opacification in the heart and veins was reduced in protocol B (P = 0.05). Increased AVCR in protocol B compared with A was observed at all anatomic locations (P < 0.0002). Increased JAFROC (P < 0.0002) and kappa variation were observed with protocol B (κ = 0.78) compared to A (κ = 0.25). Mean contrast volume was reduced in protocol B (33 ± 9 ml) compared to A (80 ± 1 ml). CONCLUSIONS Significant improvements in visualisation of the pulmonary vasculature can be achieved with a low volume of contrast agent using injection timing based on a patient-specific contrast formula. KEY POINTS • Optimal opacification of the pulmonary arteries is essential for CT pulmonary angiography. • Matching timing with vessel dynamics significantly improves vessel opacification. • This leads to increased arterial opacification and reduced venous opacification. • This can also lead to a reduced volume of contrast agent.","Saade, Charbel; Bourne, Roger; El-Merhi, Fadi; Somanathan, Arjuna; Chakraborty, Dev; Brennan, Patrick",European radiology,194,30

A telegenetics platform is critical for those with limitations or vulnerabilities compromising their ability to attend clinic in-person, including individuals in rural areas. As the demand for remote genetics services increases, and amidst the COVID-19 pandemic with social distancing practices in place, we conducted a literature review to examine the benefits and limitations of telegenetics and explore the views of patients and health professionals utilizing telegenetics. Searches of the PubMed database identified 21 relevant primary studies for inclusion. The majority of studies found acceptability of telegenetics to be high among patients and health professionals and that telegenetics provided access to genetics services for underserved communities. The main benefits cited include cost-effectiveness and reduction in travel time for genetics services providing outreach clinics and patients who would otherwise travel long distances to access genetics. Patients appreciated the convenience of telegenetics including the reduced wait times, although a minority of patients reported their psychosocial needs were not adequately met. Eight studies compared outcomes between telegenetics and in-person services; findings suggested when comparing telegenetics patients to their in-person counterparts, telegenetics patients had a similar level of knowledge and understanding of genetics and similar psychological outcomes. Some studies reported challenges related to establishing rapport and reading and responding to verbal cues via telegenetics, while technical issues were not generally found to be a major limitation. Some service adaptations, for example, counseling strategies, may be required to successfully deliver telegenetics. Further research may be necessary to gather and examine data on how telegenetics outcomes compare to that of in-person genetic counseling and adapt services accordingly.","Gorrie, Anita; Gold, Judy; Cameron, Carolyn; Krause, Molly; Kincaid, Helen",Journal of genetic counseling,194,12

The binding efficiency of the selected phage towards CRP is two orders of magnitude higher than in the wild type. We demonstrate that the phage-based sensor is selective against other proteins.

Ambulance services in Australasia use ketamine, droperidol or midazolam as first line agent but the optimal agent is uncertain. In Victoria, intramuscular (IM) ketamine is used. The present study aimed to examine the prehospital characteristics and ED outcomes of patients with severe agitation after IM ketamine administration. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted for patients who received IM ketamine for severe agitation over a 2-year period. Data were sourced from Ambulance Victoria and linked to hospital data. The primary outcome was time to sedation. Data collected included baseline characteristics, adverse events and ED outcomes. RESULTS Three hundred and fifty-eight prehospital cases transported to 32 hospitals were included. Outcome data were available for 305 patients (21 hospitals). Median age was 31 years (IQR 23-40). 71.2% were male. Adequate sedation was achieved in 96.9% of cases in a median time of 5.0 min (IQR 3.0-7.0; range 1-31 min). Adverse events were transient hypoxia (5.0%), hyper-salivation (4.2%) and emergence reactions (0.8%). A total of 45 (14.8%) patients were intubated; two prehospital. CONCLUSION Intramuscular ketamine is effective with a low rate of prehospital complications in severely agitated patients in the prehospital setting.

Heparin-""induced"" acknowledges that HIT is usually triggered by a proximate immunizing exposure to heparin. However, certain non-heparin medications (pentosan polysulfate, hypersulfated chondroitin sulfate, fondaparinux) can trigger ""HIT"". Further, naturally-occurring polyanions (bacterial lipopolysaccharide, DNA/RNA) can interact with PF4 to recapitulate HIT antigens. Indeed, immunologic presensitization to naturally-occurring polyanions could explain why HIT more closely resembles a secondary, rather than a primary, immune response. In 2008 it was first reported that a HIT-mimicking disorder can occur without any preceding exposure to heparin or polyanionic medications. Termed ""spontaneous HIT syndrome"", two subtypes are recognized: (a) surgical (post-orthopedic, especially post-total knee arthroplasty, and (b) medical (usually post-infectious). Recently, COVID-19 adenoviral vector vaccination has been associated with a thrombotic thrombocytopenic disorder associated with positive PF4-dependent enzyme-immunoassays and serum-induced platelet activation that is maximal when PF4 is added. Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) features unusual thromboses (cerebral venous thrombosis, splanchnic vein thrombosis) similar to those seen in spontaneous HIT syndrome. The emerging concept is that classic HIT reflects platelet-activating anti-PF4/heparin antibodies whereas spontaneous HIT syndrome and other atypical ""autoimmune HIT"" presentations (delayed-onset HIT, persisting HIT, heparin ""flush"" HIT) reflect heparin-independent platelet-activating anti-PF4 antibodies-although the precise relationships between PF4 epitope targets and the clinical syndromes remain to be determined.

The authors ran multiple variable logistic regression models to evaluate relationships between each predictor and outcome (α = .05) and reported odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS The survey response rate was 35.5%. Overall, 12.7% of participants reported any intention to leave. In total, 22.2% and 16.7% of participants endorsed clinically significant anxiety or depression symptomatology, respectively; 28.6% reported 1 or more burnout symptoms; and 69.0% reported that COVID-19 affected their overall mental health. Participants reporting anxiety (OR, 8.87; 95% CI, 1.80 to 43.57; P = .007), depression (OR, 11.18; 95% CI, 1.84 to 67.74; P = .009), or burnout (OR, 8.14; 95% CI, 1.73 to 38.23; P = .008) were significantly more likely to report intention to leave than those not reporting mental health problems. All participants reporting that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their mental health expressed intention to leave. CONCLUSIONS Poor mental health is common among dental trainees and is associated with intention to leave their program. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS COVID-19 has exacerbated the prevalence and consequences of poor mental health among dental students, highlighting the importance of providing wellness resources.","Chi, Donald L; Randall, Cameron L; Hill, Courtney M",Journal of the American Dental Association,194,5

Methods Plasma samples harvested from mice at different time points after carbon-ion or X-ray irradiation were analyzed using meso-scale discovery (MSD), a high-throughput and sensitive electrochemiluminescence measurement technique. Dose estimation equations were set up using multiple linear regression analysis. Results The relative levels of IL-6 at 1 h, IL-5 and IL-6 at 24 h, and IL-5, IL-6 and IL-15 at 7 d after irradiation with two intensities increased dose-dependently. The minimum measured levels of IL-5, IL-6 and IL-15 were up to 4.0076 pg/mL, 16.4538 pg/mL and 0.4150 pg/mL, respectively. In addition, dose estimation models were established and verified. Conclusions The MSD assay can provide more accurate data regarding the changes in the levels of the cytokines IL-5, IL-6 and IL-15. These cytokines could meet the essential criteria for radiosensitive biomarkers and can be used as radiation indicators.

Coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), fuse at the plasma membrane or use receptor-mediated endocytosis and fuse with endosomes, depending on the cell or tissue type. The virus spike (S) protein mediates fusion with the host cell membrane. We have shown previously that an Abelson (Abl) kinase inhibitor, imatinib, significantly reduces SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viral titres and prevents endosomal entry by HIV SARS S and MERS S pseudotyped virions. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are classified as BSL-3 viruses, which makes experimentation into the cellular mechanisms involved in infection more challenging. Here, we use IBV, a BSL-2 virus, as a model for studying the role of Abl kinase activity during coronavirus infection. We found that imatinib and two specific Abl kinase inhibitors, GNF2 and GNF5, reduce IBV titres by blocking the first round of virus infection. Additionally, all three drugs prevented IBV S-induced syncytia formation prior to the hemifusion step. Our results indicate that membrane fusion (both virus-cell and cell-cell) is blocked in the presence of Abl kinase inhibitors. Studying the effects of Abl kinase inhibitors on IBV will be useful in identifying the host cell pathways required for coronavirus infection. This will provide an insight into possible therapeutic targets to treat infections by current as well as newly emerging coronaviruses.","Sisk, Jeanne M; Frieman, Matthew B; Machamer, Carolyn E",The Journal of general virology,194,16

This study tests the diagnostic value of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) diameter for detecting IPMN malignancy using a meta-analysis of published data of resected IPMNs. Collected from a comprehensive literature search, the articles included in this analysis must report malignancy cases (high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and invasive carcinoma (IC)) and MPD diameter so that two MPD cut-offs could be created. The sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratios of the two cutoffs for predicting malignancy were calculated. A review of 1493 articles yielded 20 retrospective studies with 3982 resected cases. A cutoff of ≥5 mm is more sensitive than the ≥10 mm cutoff and has pooled sensitivity of 72.20% and 75.60% for classification of HGD and IC, respectively. Both MPD cutoffs of ≥5 mm and ≥10 mm were associated with malignancy (OR = 4.36 (95% CI: 2.82, 6.75) vs. OR = 3.18 (95% CI: 2.25, 4.49), respectively).

Various lines of evidence indicate that reactivation of these memories renders them labile which offers a potential time-window for intervention. We tested in non-human primates whether ketamine, administered during fear memory reactivation, affected passive (inhibitory) avoidance learning. For the consolidation of contextual emotional memory, the unescapable foot-shock paradigm in a passive avoidance task with two compartments (dark vs illuminated) was used. After entering the dark compartment, marmoset monkeys received four random foot-shocks (1 mA, 4 s) within 15-min. This stressful exposure increased the saliva cortisol and heart rate and impaired REM-sleep (p<0.05). One week later the monkeys were re-exposed to the stressful situation for the reconsolidation of the fearful experience. During the re-exposure the monkeys were treated with ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or saline. In week 3, the monkeys were placed in the experimental setting to test their memory for the fearful experience. In contrast to the vehicle-treated monkeys, who avoided the dark compartment, the ketamine-treated monkeys entered the dark compartment that was previously associated with the fearful experience (p<0.05). Post-mortem analysis of the hippocampus showed that ketamine-treated animals exhibited less doublecortin positive neurons and BrdU-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus. This study reveals that a single low dose of ketamine, administered upon fear retrieval in monkeys, reduce contextual fear memory and attenuate neurogenesis in the hippocampus. These are important findings for considering ketamine as a potential candidate to target traumatic memories in PTSD.","Philippens, Ingrid H C H M; Draaisma, Laurijn; Baarends, Guus; Krugers, Harm J; Vermetten, Eric",European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,194,16

Because of its simplicity when compared with multiple sequence alignment methods, the method has been widely discussed lately; and some formulas based on probabilistic models, like Hao’s and Yu’s formulas, have been proposed. In this paper, we improve these formulas by using the entropy principle which can quantify the nonrandomness occurrence of patterns in the sequences. More precisely, existing formulas are used to generate a set of possible formulas from which we choose the one that maximizes the entropy. We give the closed-form solution to the resulting optimization problem. Hence, from any given CV formula, we can find the corresponding one that maximizes the entropy. In particular, we show that Hao’s formula is itself maximizing the entropy and we derive a new entropy-maximizing formula from Yu’s formula. We illustrate the accuracy of our new formula by using both simulated and experimental data sets. For the simulated data sets, our new formula gives the best consensus and significant values for three different kinds of evolution models. For the data set of tetrapod 18S rRNA sequences, our new formula groups the clades of bird and reptile together correctly, where Hao’s and Yu’s formulas failed. Using real data sets with different sizes, we show that our formula is more accurate than Hao’s and Yu’s formulas even for small data sets.","Chan, Raymond H; Chan, Tony H; Yeung, Hau Man; Wang, Roger Wei",IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,194,1

RECENT FINDINGS The rate of good treatment adherence in PsA can be as low as 57.7% and successful patient education can help improve treatment adherence. Also, 78.7% of patients who stopped their disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic did so without the advice of their clinician. In delivering educational needs, the aspects of disease process, treatment, self-help measures, managing pain, movement, psychological and social needs should all be addressed, whilst at the same time, recognising that PsA patients with multidomain disease, are likely to be dealing with more than just pain. Arthritis self-care management education is potentially beneficial, but up to 11% of educational YouTube videos may contain misleading patient opinion and many existing apps do not meet the needs of the patients with PsA.

AREAS COVERED Recently, doxycycline, a broad spectrum antibiotic which has also reported anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties was widely investigated in clinical trials, either alone or in combination with other drugs and repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. In the review, the potential therapeutic applications of doxycycline in COVID-19 treatment and its potential adverse implications with respect to antimicrobial resistance bestowed by repurposing the antibiotic has been expounded. EXPERT OPINION 'Fighting disease with already existing antibiotics' and 'antimicrobial resistance progression' are like two arms of a balance that has to be carefully equilibrated. Any imbalance by inappropriate or indiscriminate use of repurposed drug would cause a disastrous increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Hence, cautious parallel assessment of potential long-term consequences of AMR is of great importance to mankind as its impacts would prevail even after the current pandemic.","Narendrakumar, Lekshmi; Joseph, Iype; Thomas, Sabu",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,194,1

The patients were divided into two groups: use of BIMA or use of SIMA and propensity matched. To assess the effect of preoperative HbA1c, both groups were further divided into 5 sub-groups: patients without diabetes mellitus (DM), or patients with diabetes mellitus and a preoperative HbA1c level in one of four groups (< 7%, 7-9%, 9-11%, or > 11%). The post-operative outcomes in both the BIMA and SIMA groups were compared. There were 700,504 and 28,115 patients with measured pre-operative HbA1c levels in the SIMA and BIMA groups, respectively.

It has been proposed as a non-invasive parameter for the prediction of the response to volume expansion in hypovolemic patients. The effect of resistive breathing on the DPOP parameter was studied to determine whether it may have an adjunct use as a measure of respiratory effort. Healthy volunteers were tasked to breathe at fixed respiratory rates over a range of airway resistances generated by a flow resistor inserted within a mouthpiece. Changes in respiratory efforts, effected by the subjects and measured as airway pressures at the mouth, were compared to DPOP values derived from a finger pulse oximeter probe. It was found that the increased effort to breathe manifests itself as an associated increase in DPOP. Further, a relationship between DPOP and percent modulation of the pleth waveform was observed. A version of the DPOP algorithm that corrects for low perfusion was implemented which resulted in an improved relationship between DPOP and PPV. Although a limited cohort of seven volunteers was used, the results suggest that DPOP may be useful as a respiratory effort parameter, given that the fluid level of the patient is maintained at a constant level over the period of analysis.","Addison, Paul S",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,194,1

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of OSA on weight loss after bariatric surgery and to provide predictive factors for insufficient weight loss (defined as ≤50% excess weight loss (EWL)) at 1 year follow-up. METHODS All consecutive patients, who underwent primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy between 2006 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with data on preoperative apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and pre- and postoperative body mass index (BMI) were included. After surgery, the percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) and BMI changes were compared between preoperatively diagnosed OSA-, subdivided in mild, moderate, and severe OSA, and non-OSA patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis evaluated predictive factors for ≤50% EWL. RESULTS A total of 816 patients, 522 (64%) with and 294 (36%) without OSA, were included. After 1 year, OSA patients achieved less %EWL than non-OSA patients (65.5 SD 20.7 versus 70.3 SD 21.0; p < 0.01). The lowest %EWL was seen in severe OSA patients (61.7 SD 20.2). However, when adjusted for waist circumference, BMI, and age, no effect of OSA was seen on %EWL or changes in BMI. Although AHI, gender, age, BMI, type of surgery, and type II diabetes were predictive factors for ≤50% EWL (area under the curve 0.778), the AHI as variable was of little importance. CONCLUSIONS The presence of OSA does not individually impair weight loss after bariatric surgery.","de Raaff, Christel A L; Coblijn, Usha K; de Vries, Nico; Heymans, Martijn W; van den Berg, Bob T J; van Tets, Willem F; van Wagensveld, Bart A",Obesity surgery,194,14

Despite modern metallurgy and internal stabilization, plaster casts and splints remain an important means of external stabilization. Casting is a dying art as modern internal and external fixation replace external immobilization. Proper casting technique is paramount. This manuscript outlines the history and chemistry of immobilization materials and techniques as well as the differences among them and the advantages and disadvantages of each. METHODS Historical references, peer-reviewed journals, textbooks, and primary sources were reviewed to provide data for this review. RESULTS The history of immobilization reveals a progressive development and refinement of materials that culminated in Mathijsen's plaster bandage in 1851. In 1798, calcium sulfate (plaster of Paris) was introduced. By 1927, crinoline rolls dipped in plaster treated with binding agents facilitated application. Synthetic casting ""tapes"" (45% polyurethane resin and 55% fiberglass) were introduced in the 1970s. Splinting techniques are ancient, with development spurred by treatment of war wounds. Plaster relies on soft-tissue contact to maintain rigidity. There are well-known advantages, disadvantages, and complications of plaster management. Casting materials all create an exothermic reaction. Burns are associated with water temperatures of >24°C, more than eight layers (ply), and inadequate ventilation. The maximum water temperature must be lower with fiberglass casts. Plaster was the definitive management for most fractures for over 100 years until it was replaced by modern surgical techniques involving internal fixation in the latter part of the twentieth century. CONCLUSIONS Plaster casts and splints remain an important treatment method for acute and chronic orthopaedic conditions.","DeMaio, Marlene; McHale, Kathleen; Lenhart, Martha; Garland, Joshua; McIlvaine, Christopher; Rhode, Michael",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Particularly in early age groups, many developmental processes are not reflected by simple scalars such as body weight or body surface area, and even projecting doses based on simple allometric scaling can lead to significant overdoses in certain age groups. Modeling and simulation methodology, including physiologically based modeling, has evolved as part of the drug development toolkit and is being increasingly applied to various aspects of pediatric drug development. Pediatric physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models account for the development of organs and the ontogeny of specific enzymes and transporters that determine the age-related pharmacokinetic profiles. However, when should this approach be used, and when will simpler methods such as allometric scaling suffice in answering specific problems? The aim of this review article is to illustrate the application of allometric scaling and PBPK in pediatric drug development and explore the optimal application of the latter approach with reference to case examples. In reality, allometric scaling included as part of population pharmacokinetic and PBPK approaches are all part of a model-informed drug development toolkit helping with decision making during the process of drug discovery and development; to that end, they should be viewed as complementary.","Johnson, Trevor N; Ke, Alice B",Journal of clinical pharmacology,194,19

Conventional air-purifying respirators (APR) and modern loose-fitting powered air-purifying respirator-hoods (PAPR-hood) may have a different impact during pediatric resuscitation and therefore require evaluation. OBJECTIVE This study investigated the influence of APRs and PAPR-hoods during simulated pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS Study design was a randomized, controlled, crossover study. Sixteen paramedics carried out a standardized EPLS scenario inside an ambulance, either unprotected (control) or wearing a conventional APR or a PAPR-hood. Treatment times and wearer comfort were determined and compared. RESULTS All paramedics completed the treatment objectives of the study arms without adverse events. Study subjects reported that communication, dexterity and mobility were significantly better in the APR group, whereas the heat-build-up was significantly less in the PAPR-hood group. Treatment times compared to the control group did not significantly differ for the APR group but did with the PAPR-hood group (261±12 seconds for the controls, 275±9 seconds for the conventional APR and 286±13 seconds for the PAPR-hood group, P < .05. CONCLUSIONS APRs showed a trend to better treatment times compared to PAPR-hoods during simulated pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Study participants rated mobility, ease of communication and dexterity with the tight-fitting APR system significantly better compared to the loose-fitting PAPR-hood.","Schumacher, Jan; Gray, Stuart A; Michel, Sophie; Alcock, Roger; Brinker, Andrea",Prehospital and disaster medicine,194,17

To characterize T cell immunity, but also for the development of vaccines, identification of exact viral T cell epitopes is fundamental. Here we identify and characterize multiple dominant and subdominant SARS-CoV-2 HLA class I and HLA-DR peptides as potential T cell epitopes in COVID-19 convalescent and unexposed individuals. SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides enabled detection of post-infectious T cell immunity, even in seronegative convalescent individuals. Cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 peptides revealed pre-existing T cell responses in 81% of unexposed individuals and validated similarity with common cold coronaviruses, providing a functional basis for heterologous immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Diversity of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses was associated with mild symptoms of COVID-19, providing evidence that immunity requires recognition of multiple epitopes. Together, the proposed SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes enable identification of heterologous and post-infectious T cell immunity and facilitate development of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic measures for COVID-19.","Nelde, Annika; Bilich, Tatjana; Heitmann, Jonas S; Maringer, Yacine; Salih, Helmut R; Roerden, Malte; Lübke, Maren; Bauer, Jens; Rieth, Jonas; Wacker, Marcel; Peter, Andreas; Hörber, Sebastian; Traenkle, Bjoern; Kaiser, Philipp D; Rothbauer, Ulrich; Becker, Matthias; Junker, Daniel; Krause, Gérard; Strengert, Monika; Schneiderhan-Marra, Nicole; Templin, Markus F; Joos, Thomas O; Kowalewski, Daniel J; Stos-Zweifel, Vlatka; Fehr, Michael; Rabsteyn, Armin; Mirakaj, Valbona; Karbach, Julia; Jäger, Elke; Graf, Michael; Gruber, Lena-Christin; Rachfalski, David; Preuß, Beate; Hagelstein, Ilona; Märklin, Melanie; Bakchoul, Tamam; Gouttefangeas, Cécile; Kohlbacher, Oliver; Klein, Reinhild; Stevanović, Stefan; Rammensee, Hans-Georg; Walz, Juliane S",Nature immunology,194,28

Using a canine model, we designed a survival study to test the feasibility of 90% hepatectomy with a portohepatic shunt. Of eight mixed-hound canines, it was necessary to sacrifice two animals for postmortem study of hepatic anatomy; we used the results to design a procedure for removing all of the liver except portions of two lobes. We tested this 90% hepatectomy procedure under general anesthesia in the remaining animals, with (N=3) or without (N=3) a portohepatic shunt. We monitored animals postoperatively with serial liver biochemical testing, and sacrificed on postoperative day 48. Assessment of liver regeneration was by weight after complete postmortem hepatectomy. Extended hepatectomy removed four complete lobes and portions of the right lateral and caudate lobes. For the portohepatic shunt, we anastomosed the left portal vein branch to the left hepatic vein branch. All procedures were performed successfully. One no-shunt animal expired on the second postoperative day. We thus confirmed the feasibility of 90% hepatectomy with portohepatic shunt in the canine model. If the efficacy of shunting is validated in a larger study population, it may increase the indications for extensive resection in patients with advanced hepatic malignancy.","Steen, Shawn; Conway, Charles; Guerra, Catalina; Kargozaran, Hamed; Gagandeep, Singh",ILAR journal,194,16

We performed a weighted meta-analysis of the outcomes in patients with coronary stents undergoing bridging with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors prior to surgery. METHODS We conducted a weighted meta-analysis of preoperative bridging studies published between 2002 and 2013 in patients with coronary stents undergoing surgery. Data on in-hospital mortality, stent thrombosis, bleeding, hemoglobin decrease, blood transfusion, time to hospital discharge and myocardial infarction were collected. RESULTS A total of eight studies with 280 patients were included. Pooled estimates of outcomes were as follows: in-hospital mortality 3.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-5.9%); stent thrombosis 1.3% (95% CI 0.3-3.0%); major bleeding 7.4% (95% CI 2.8-14.1%); any bleeding 20.6% (95% CI 4.8-43.2%); mean decrease in hemoglobin 2.8 g/dL (95% CI 2.5-3.0 g/dL); mean blood loss 271 mL (95% CI 211-311 mL); blood transfusion 13.9% (95% CI 1.0-38.2%); time to hospital discharge 5.9 days (95% CI 4.4-7.3 days); and myocardial infarction 1.6% (95% CI 0.3-3.6%).

Using an efficient, non-engineering implantation method, we first demonstrated that both implants of ADSCs and DPSCs were able to grow self-assembled new teeth in adult rabbit extraction sockets with high success rate. The stem cells were necessary because the implants grew no tooth without them. A stepwise comparison showed that the regenerated teeth from these two types of adult stem cells were living with nerves and vascular system and remarkably similar to a normal tooth in many details. Further strictly controlled, side-by-side comparisons between the two types of stem cells also showed that the expression patterns of gene markers and the broad differentiation potentials induced by specific methods in vitro were very similar. Although a few differences were found, they did not affect the tested tooth regeneration in vivo or differentiation in vitro. Furthermore, rabbit ADSCs had a higher growth rate and a better senescence resistance in culture. All these findings suggest that ADSCs, one of the richest adult stem cells in mammals, are very similar and useful as DPSCs for regenerative dentistry.","Hung, Chia-Nung; Mar, Kwei; Chang, Hao-Chen; Chiang, Yi-Lun; Hu, Huai-Yun; Lai, Chia-Chi; Chu, Rei-Min; Ma, Chang M",Biomaterials,194,1

This paper focuses on the shift of the SPP interference patterns in the symmetric arc slit structures. The excitation models with one incident beam and two incident beams are established and analyzed respectively, and methods to shift the SPP interference patterns via adjusting the tilt angle and initial phase of the excitation beams are compared. The FDTD simulation results show that these methods can precisely shift the SPP interference patterns in the symmetrical arc slits. Compared to the linear slits, the SPP waves arising from arc slits are more strongly focused, resulting in a stronger gradient force. The characteristics of stronger focus and dynamic shifting of the focal spot give the symmetric arc slit structure unique advantages in the capture and transfer of the Rayleigh metallic particle.","Bai, Chunyan; Chen, Jian; Zhang, Yuxing; Kanwal, Saima; Zhang, Dawei; Zhan, Qiwen",Optics express,194,31

MERS-CoV shedding in some dromedary camel secretions, particularly nasal swabs, were studied in more detail. However, the roles of viral shedding in saliva and ocular secretions are still required further detailed studies. We performed a longitudinal study on a farm of dromedary camel herd from 10th March until 7th April, 2019, in eastern Saudi Arabia. This is a closed management herd including a large number of colour-based breed animals and include animals of both sexes. We collected saliva and ocular swabs from 18% of the target animal population. Detection of the MERS-CoV-RNAs in these samples was conducted by the real-time PCR technique. We detected the viral RNAs in the saliva of and conjunctival swabs of some of the tested animals at 33%, 77% and 88% during the three-time points, respectively. Moreover, we also detected the viral RNAs in the conjunctival swabs at 11%, 22% and 33% at similar time intervals. Our results are suggesting the possibility of MERS-CoV shedding in the saliva and the ocular discharges of the infected dromedary camels. This explains, at least in part, the mechanism of transmission of MERS-CoV from animals to humans. More studies are needed for a better understanding of the transmission of MERS-CoV from animals to humans; thus, the risk of virus spread can be mitigated.","Hemida, Maged Gomaa; Ali, Ali Mohamed; Alnaeem, Abdelmohsen",Zoonoses and public health,194,5

Whilst the vaccines about to enter the market, are an important component of the strategy to combat COVID-19, vaccination should be considered a part of a wider strategy to address this and future zoonotic viral outbreaks. Plant-based approaches may provide valuable avenues for viral disease management. Methods: This commentary combines an appraisal of the existing literature with the authors thoughts on key challenges that pharmacognosy may be able to assist with, in the management of zoonotic viral disease. Results: There are many avenues for plant-based antiviral research in the context of the present COVID-19 pandemic. This narrative review discusses the use of plant-based approaches;as viral drug leads, as agents for managing the cytokine storm associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome, as agents for elimination of viral reservoirs and as agents in hand sanitisation. Conclusion: Whilst the arrival of vaccines is an important step in the response to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacognosy still has a role to play in the management of this and future viral pandemics. The support of researchers in this domain is needed to combat viral pandemics via arming clinicians with a broader range of options for prevention and treatment of viral illness on a global scale.","Alcorn, Sean R.",Pharmacognosy Communications,194,24

A major challenge for the supply chain (SC) is to address this disruption risk and bring sustainability to SC. The objective of this paper is to identify the stakeholders' requirements and critical success factors (CSFs) for the sustainability initiative in SC during this pandemic situation. Three potential stakeholders' requirements and a total of 16 critical success factors have been identified by taking inputs from experts and decision-makers. Further, these critical factors are analyzed and ranked based on a hybrid quality function deployment (QFD)-best-worst methodology (BWM). The QFD method has been used to identify the stakeholder’ requirements. And, the BWM has been adopted to prioritize the CSFs. The scientific value of the study is the contribution of the framework model for the sustainable initiatives in the SC during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, identification of stakeholders’ requirements and CSFs, and prioritizes these CSFs. The top three most critical success factors are found to be social distancing, emergency logistics systems, and emergency backup facilities.

Yet, relatively little is known about attitudes towards covid-19 vaccines in these countries and in Africa in particular. In this paper, we provide cross-country comparable estimates of the willingness to accept a covid-19 vaccine in six Sub-Saharan African countries. Methods We use data from six national high-frequency phone surveys from countries representing 38% of the Sub-Saharan African population (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, and Uganda). Samples are drawn from large, nationally representative sampling frames providing a rich set of demographic and socio-economic characteristics by which we disaggregate our analysis. Using a set of re-calibrated survey weights, our analysis adjusts for the selection biases common in remote surveys. Results Acceptance rates in the six Sub-Saharan African countries studied are generally high, with at least four in five people willing to be vaccinated in all but one country. Vaccine acceptance ranges from nearly universal in Ethiopia (97.9%, 97.2% to 98.6%) to below what would likely be required for herd immunity in Mali (64.5%, 61.3% to 67.8%). We find little evidence for systematic differences in vaccine hesitancy by sex or age but some clusters of hesitancy in urban areas, among the better educated, and in richer households. Safety concerns about the vaccine in general and its side effects emerge as the primary reservations toward a covid-19 vaccine across countries. Conclusions Our findings suggest that limited supply, not inadequate demand, likely presents the key bottleneck to reaching high covid-19 vaccine coverage in Sub-Saharan Africa. To turn intent into effective demand, targeted communication campaigns bolstering confidence in the safety of approved vaccines and reducing concerns about side effects will be crucial to safeguard the swift progression of vaccine rollout in one of the world's poorest regions.","Kanyanda, S.; Markhof, Y.; Wollburg, P.; Zezza, A.",,194,29

Here, we show that neutrophil-derived myeloperoxidase delays the onset of immune dysfunction during systemic candidiasis by controlling microbes captured by splenic marginal zone (MZ) macrophages. In contrast, SIGNR1-mediated microbe capture accelerates MZ colonization and immune dysfunction by triggering T cell death, T cell-dependent chromatin release and the synergistic induction of G-CSF by histones and fungi. Histones and G-CSF promote the prevalence of immature Ly6Glow neutrophils with defective oxidative burst, by selectively shortening the lifespan of mature Ly6Ghigh neutrophils. Consistently, T cell deficiency, or blocking SIGNR1, G-CSF or histones delayed neutrophil dysfunction. Furthermore, histones and G-CSF in the plasma of sepsis patients, shortened neutrophil lifespan and correlated with neutrophil mortality markers associated with a poor prognosis. Hence, the compromise of internal antimicrobial barrier sites drives neutrophil dysfunction by selectively modulating neutrophil lifespan via pathogenic T cell death, extracellular histones, and G-CSF.","Ioannou, Marianna; Hoving, Dennis; Aramburu, Iker Valle; De Vasconcelos, Nathalia M.; Temkin, Mia I.; Wang, Qian; Vernardis, Spyros; Demichev, Vadim; Tsourouktsoglou, Theodora-Dorita; Boeing, Stefan; Goldstone, Robert; David, Sascha; Stahl, Klaus; Bode, Christian; Ralser, Markus; Papayannopoulos, Venizelos",bioRxiv,194,24

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) can result in pulmonary hypertension and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with SCD (Gladwin et al, NEJM, 2008). ACS accounts for 25% of deaths (Vichinsky et al, Blood, 1997). Clinical definition of ACS is chest pain, fever, cough, dyspnea, and new pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiography. Defibrotide was approved in the US for the treatment of severe sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS) with renal or pulmonary dysfunction following HSCT (Cairo et al, BJH, 2020). Defibrotide primarily targets endothelium in microvascular beds and has anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant activity, which can treat the underlying pathophysiology of ACS (Falanga et al, Leukemia, 2003 and Scallia et al, Clin Pharm, 1996 and Pescador et al, Vasc Pharm, 2013). Objective: To determine the safety and toxicity of defibrotide in children, adolescents, and young adults with SCD-associated ACS. Design/Methods: Patients with SCD aged 2 to 40 years meeting ACS criteria (at least two of the following: fever, chest pain, cough, dyspnea, tachypnea, pulmonary infiltrate on chest imaging, decreased oxygen saturation with or without supplemental oxygen requirements) and eligibility were enrolled within 72 hours of diagnosis after consent was obtained (NCT03805581). Baseline studies comprised of chest radiograph, CT chest angiogram, echocardiography with TRJ velocity and brachial artery reactivity, pulmonary function tests, and biomarkers (IFN-a and -g, TNF-a, IL-6, 8, and 10, sCD163, TSP-1, secretory phospholipase A(2), sVCAM-1, sTNFR1, Ang2, sTei-2, PAI-1, sICAM-1, sP-and sE-selectin, sPECAM-1, VEGF-A, C, D and sVEGFR1 and 2). Defibrotide was administered at 6.25mg/kg IV q6 hours and continued for 7 days or until time of discharge, whichever occurred earlier and patients were followed until day +30 following defibrotide. Dose limiting toxicities include Grade III/IV infusion/allergic reaction or hemorrhage probably or directly related to defibrotide. Results: We have enrolled thirteen patients aged 3 to 18 years with a gender ratio (M/F) of 4/9. Patients' genotypes are as follows: hemoglobin SS disease in nine patients, hemoglobin SC disease in two patients, and hemoglobin Sb0/+ thalassemia in two patients. Presenting symptoms included fever, chest pain, cough, dyspnea, tachypnea, pulmonary infiltrate on imaging, and hypoxia.Eight patients completed seven days of treatment, one patient received 6 days of treatment, three patients were discharged after three days of treatment, and one patient withdrew due to recurrent fevers unrelated to defibrotide. All but one patient had resolution of fevers prior to end of treatment. Patients required an average of 1.15 days of oxygen support, with one patient requiring high flow nasal cannula, and no patients required mechanical ventilation. There were no adverse events possibly, probably, or directly related to defibrotide. There was no evidence of hemorrhage in any patient despite four patients receiving concomitant ketorolac or ibuprofen. Of the eleven patients who had pulmonary infiltrates on imaging, eight were evaluated on day +30, two had complete resolution of infiltrate, five had improvements, and one had no change. Seven patients did not follow-up for echocardiography or pulmonary function testing and two of those patients were unable to be evaluated at day +30 due to COVID-19. Discussion: The preliminary data suggest defibrotide is safe and well tolerated in patients with SCD-related ACS. All patients at diagnosis have had baseline studies, which included biomarkers;however, only eight of the thirteen patients have completed all required observations due to poor compliance. After four patients were enrolled and three failed to follow-up, changes to appointment schedules were made with detailed information on all follow-ups. Efforts at improving compliance post therapy are ongoing. Further accrual is needed to determine clinical significance of improvements in cardiac and/or pulmonary function.

Blended learning, which includes online classes, television and radio broadcasts, and modular lessons, offers a more inclusive education that caters to the needs of the students. While the subject has been discussed in the literature from the perspective of the learners, this paper explores the perceptions, experiences, and insights of teachers in the Philippines on blended learning at the time of the pandemic. This study surveyed 39 basic education teachers and analyzed the data using qualitative content analysis. The results showed an agreement on teachers' perspectives about the effectiveness of educational policies implemented and the government's response to the pandemic. Despite the flexibility in using blended learning, the teachers experienced various challenges in applying this method during the pandemic, such as readiness, technology literacy, access to technology, financial difficulties, and health risk. These findings suggest the government and other education stakeholders provide additional financial support to schools during the pandemic;enhance the professional development activities for teachers;and continue developing learning platforms allowing open access to quality and reliable educational resources during and beyond the pandemic. ©Authors This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).","Batac, K.

A collection of 1,800 serum samples obtained between January and August 2021 was used. The analysis indicates that while anti-spike IgG levels significantly wane over time, the neutralizing potency to the first-wave linages of SARS-CoV-2 and VOC increases within four months of vaccination, suggesting that antibody maturation occurs. This increase was more evident for the Beta and Gamma variants, which showed the highest propensity for neutralization escape.

Here, we introduce the UCLA ATLAS Community Health Initiative-- a biobank of genomic data linked with de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of UCLA Health patients. We leverage the unique genomic diversity of the patient population in ATLAS to explore the interplay between self-reported race/ethnicity and genetic ancestry within a disease context using phenotypes extracted from the EHR. First, we identify an extensive amount of continental and subcontinental genomic diversity within the ATLAS data that is consistent with the global diversity of Los Angeles; this includes clusters of ATLAS individuals corresponding to individuals with Korean, Japanese, Filipino, and Middle Eastern genomic ancestries. Most importantly, we find that common diseases and traits stratify across genomic ancestry clusters, thus suggesting their utility in understanding disease biology across diverse individuals. Next, we showcase the power of genetic data linked with EHR to perform ancestry-specific genome and phenome-wide scans to identify genetic factors for a variety of EHR-derived phenotypes (phecodes). For example, we find ancestry-specific associations for liver disease, and link the genetic variants with neurological and neoplastic phenotypes primarily within individuals of admixed ancestries.

It is essential to monitor efficiently its spread to help guide public health policies. Genome sequencing is the gold standard for identification of Delta, but is time-consuming, expensive, and unavailable in many regions. We describe here a rapid and relatively inexpensive alternative to sequencing for specific identification of the Delta variant, by application of double-mismatch allele-specific RT-PCR (DMAS-RT-PCR). The technique exploits forward and reverse allele-specific primers, targeting two spike gene mutations, L452R and T478K, within the same amplicon. The discriminatory power of each primer is enhanced by the presence of an additional mismatch located at the fourth nucleotide from the 3' end. Amplicons are detected in real-time by means of a conventional fluorescently-labelled hydrolysis probe. Specificity was assessed by testing a range of well characterised cell culture-derived viral isolates and clinical samples, most of which had previously been fully sequenced. In all cases the results of viral genotyping by DMAS-RT-PCR were entirely concordant with the results of sequencing, and the assay was shown to discriminate reliably between the Delta variant and other variants of concern (Alpha, B.1.1.7 and Beta, B.1.351), and 'wild-type' SARS-CoV-2. Other respiratory viruses, including influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus, were non-reactive in the assay. The sensitivity of DMAS-RT-PCR matched that of the diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR screening assay, which targets the E gene. Several samples that could not be sequenced due to insufficient virus could successfully be genotyped by DMAS-RT-PCR. The method we describe would be simple to establish in any laboratory that has the ability to conduct PCR assays and should greatly facilitate monitoring of the spread of the Delta variant throughout the world, and its proportional representation in any SARS-CoV-2-infected population.","Garson, J.

Methods: Consortium research teams conducted online surveys in 30 countries. Primary outcomes included sexual behaviors, partner violence, and SRH service utilization, and we compared three months prior to and three months after policy measures to mitigate COVID-19. We used established indicators and analyses pre-specified in our protocol. We conducted meta-analyses for primary outcomes and graded the certainty of the evidence using Cochrane methods. Findings: Descriptive analyses included 22,724 individuals in 25 countries. Five additional countries with sample sizes <200 were included in descriptive meta-analyses. Respondents were mean age 34 years; most identified as women (15160; 66.7%), cis-gender (19432; 86.6%) and heterosexual (16592; 77.9%).

Considering the presence of any added abnormal sound (crackles or wheeze) in at least two auscultation points as evidence of LRT involvement, LungPass demonstrated a sensitivity of 98.6% (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 96.4%-99.6%) and a specificity of 96.9% (95% CI: 83.8%-99.9%) in identifying COVID-19 LRT involvement. Conclusion: This exploratory study suggests the LungPass is a sensitive and specific platform for identifying LRT involvement due to COVID-19, even before the development of hypoxia.","Lapteva, E.

Design/methodology/approach: A convenience sample of 191 Lebanese individuals completed measures of length of being in lockdown, fear of COVID-19, job insecurity, political trust, self-harm and suicidal ideation. Data were analyzed using independent samples t-tests and multiple regression. Findings: Fear of COVID-19 was associated with neither self-harm nor suicidal ideation. Males and people with lower income reported higher suicidal ideation than females and those with higher income, respectively, and religiosity was inversely associated with suicidal ideation. People who reported self-harm generally exhibited lower political trust than those who did not report self-harm. Research limitations/implications: Beyond the fear of COVID-19, the socioeconomic sequelae of COVID-19 (especially the economic fallout and declining political trust), which are accentuated in already economically and politically unstable societies, may precipitate poor mental health and maladaptive coping strategies in Lebanon. There is a need to ensure adequate access to mental health services to the general population amid the COVID-19 outbreak in Lebanon. Originality/value: This study provides novel insight into the risk factors for self-harm and suicidal ideation in Lebanon during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, Ismael Maatouk, Moubadda Assi and Rusi Jaspal.","Maatouk, I.; Assi, M.; Jaspal, R.",Journal of Health Research,194,1

To improve validity, we compare situations in which developers naturally use different setups-the difference between working at home or at the office, and how things changed when developers were forced to work from home due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The results indicate that using multiple monitors is indeed perceived as beneficial and desirable. 19% of the respondents reported adding a monitor to their home setup in response to the Covid-19 situation. At the same time, the single most influential factor cited as affecting productivity was not the physical setup but interactions with co-workers-both reduced productivity due to lack of connections available at work, and improved productivity due to reduced interruptions from coworkers.

POC assays are easy to use and do not require skilled personnel; therefore they are particularly useful in low resource settings where diagnostics laboratories equipped with complex instruments that require well trained technicians are not available. Samples can be processed immediately overcoming the problems related to the stability of the sample, storage and shipping to a centralized laboratory hospital based. Furthermore, results are delivered in real-time, usually less than 1 hr; thus, a clinical decision can be taken earlier. A prompt diagnosis is crucial in the case of contagious diseases allowing a rapid isolation of the infected patient and treatment; thus, reducing the risk of transmission of the pathogen. In this report, we address the use of POC assays in the diagnosis of infectious pathogens including hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus-type 1, human papillomavirus, chlamydia trachomatis, neisseria gonorrhea, trichomonas vaginalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis and the parasite plasmodium.

DESIGN Cross-sectional telephone survey of 705 Hong Kong and 1,201 Singapore adults selected by random-digit dialing. RESULTS Hong Kong respondents had significantly higher anxiety than Singapore respondents (State Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI] score, 2.06 vs 1.77; P < .001). The former group also reported more frequent headaches, difficulty breathing, dizziness, rhinorrhea, and sore throat. More than 90% in both cities were willing to be quarantined if they had close contact with a SARS case, and 70% or more would be compliant for social contacts. Most respondents (86.7% in Hong Kong vs 71.4% in Singapore; P < .001) knew that SARS could be transmitted via respiratory droplets, although fewer (75.8% in Hong Kong vs 62.1% in Singapore; P < .001) knew that fomites were also a possible transmission source. Twenty-three percent of Hong Kong and 11.9% of Singapore respondents believed that they were ""very likely"" or ""somewhat likely"" to contract SARS during the current outbreak (P < .001). There were large differences between Hong Kong and Singapore in the adoption of personal precautionary measures. Respondents with higher levels of anxiety, better knowledge about SARS, and greater risk perceptions were more likely to take comprehensive precautionary measures against the infection, as were older, female, and more educated individuals. CONCLUSION Comparative psychobehavioral surveillance and analysis could yield important insights into generic versus population-specific issues that could be used to inform, design, and evaluate public health infection control policy measures.","Leung, Gabriel M; Quah, Stella; Ho, Lai-Ming; Ho, Sai-Yin; Hedley, Anthony J; Lee, Hin-Peng; Lam, Tai-Hing",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,194,17

The S protein in feline infectious peritonitis virus-infected cells was found to have a half time of acquisition of resistance to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H of approximately 1 h. This difference can be explained by the fact that coronavirus budding takes place at intracellular membranes and that the oligosaccharides of the spike protein are modified after budding.

With relatively modest vertical air circulation, most of the air in a room can be irradiated in a relatively brief time period without noise or significant power consumption. The hypothesis tested in this study is that the efficacy of upper-room UVGI to inactivate or kill airborne infectious microorganisms can be determined from an index of UVGI effectiveness, a dimensionless parameter designed to characterize adequacy of vertical air circulation, amount of UVGI provided, and their interaction. This index of effectiveness, which is determined independently of microbiological testing, was found to correlate well with experimental measurements made in a room-size chamber. A comparison of two other dimensionless parameters - the irradiation number and mixing number, from which effectiveness index is calculated - provides insight into whether the quantity of UV provided to the upper room or the intensity of the vertical air circulation is the controlling factor for effective application of upper-room UVGI. The irradiation number is calculated from the UV power output of the fixture(s), a parameter that is fixture specific and much easier to measure than mean fluence rate. An equation was also developed that relates UV fixture power output to mean fluence rate in either the irradiated zone or the entire room. In addition, reductions in viable microorganism concentration due to UVGI predicted from a two-box model are compared with experimental measurements.","Rudnick, Stephen N; First, Melvin W",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,194,31

The aim of this study was to establish the influence of the process of photo inactivation in pathogens using riboflavin and UV rays on the concentration of coagulation factor VIII:C (FVIII:C) and proteins in plasma that were treated before freezing. METHODS The examination included 20 units of plasma, separated from whole blood donated by voluntary blood donors around 6 hours from the moment of collection. The units were pooled and separated in to two groups: one consisted of 10 control units and the other of 10 experimental units. Experimental units of the plasma were treated by riboflavin (35 mL) and UV rays (6.24 J/mL, 265-370 nm) on Mirasol aparature (Caridian BCT Biotechnologies, USA) in approximate duration of 6 minutes. Furthermore, 35 mL of saline solution was added to the control plasma. One sample for examining was taken from the control plasma (KG) and two residual were taken from experimental plasma after the addition of riboflavin either before (EG1) or post illumination (EG2). Results. Comparing the mean values of FVIII:C (%) we noticed statistically significantly higher level in the EG1 group than in the EG2 group (65.00 +/- 4.52 vs. 63.20 +/- 4.73; t = 4.323, p = 0.002), while between the KG and experimental groups (EG1 and EG2) there was no statistically significant difference in the concentration of FVIII:C. There was a statistically significant decrease of albumin concentration (g/L) in the EG2 group comparing to the KG (33.35 +/- 0.94 vs. 31.94 +/- 0.84; t = 3.534, p = 0.002), but there was no mentioned difference in albumin concentration between the KG and the EG1, so as between the EG1 and the EG2. CONCLUSION Plasma inactivated by riboflavin and UV rays (Mirasol PRT system, Caridian BCT, U.S.A.) keeps all the characteristics of conventional plasma, so it could be used for the treatment of pathological conditions that demand transfusion of fresh frozen plasma, or in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpure when we use therapeutic exchange of plasma.","Stanojković, Zoran; Antić, Ana",Vojnosanitetski pregled,194,17

The study is aimed to assess the variations in spectrum of Covid-19 CT findings and relating severity (CT Severity Score) with the Clinical Symptoms in Bahawal Victoria Hospital, Bahawalpur. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, patients referred to radiology department from outdoor for COVID screening were included from 1st May to 30th June 2020. Mean age range of patients was calculated, while presenting complaints and co-morbidities were tabulated in frequencies and percentages after analysis. Severity of symptoms and CT findings were correlated with biochemical and haematological tests. RESULTS Patients' age range from 25 to 85 years with 62% males and 38% females. Statistically no significant difference was observed in CTSS on gender basis. As sensitivity of RT PCR is about 70%, negative cases cannot be considered disease free and this is seen in this study as CT findings suggestive of COVID are seen in these patients. Using 40-point CT-SS, 11 patients had a score of >19 with severe diseases, while 14 patients had common disease with a score range of 11-18 and 35 patients had <10 score with mild or no symptoms.

Pairwise comparisons showed that genetic distances between isolates ranged from 2.5% to 7.9% (mean 5.8% +/- 0.2%) whereas the Lelystad strain from Europe was, on average, 34.8% divergent from US clones. Thus, US and European PRRSV isolates represent genetically distinct clusters of the same virus. ORF 5, which encodes the envelope glycoprotein, was the most polymorphic [total nucleotide diversity (pi) = 0.097 +/- 0.007] and ORF 6, encoding the viral M protein, was the most conserved (pi = 0.038 +/- 0.003). The substantial differences in nucleotide diversity among ORFs suggests that the virus is evolving by processes other than simple accumulation of random neutral mutations. In support of this hypothesis, statistical analyses of the nucleotide sequence provided strong evidence for intragenic recombination or gene conversion in ORFs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7, but not in ORF 6. An excess of synonymous (silent) substitutions was observed in all six ORFs, indicating an evolutionary pressure to conserve amino acid sequences. Taken together, the data indicate that despite intragenic recombination among extant PRRSV isolates, purifying selection has acted to maintain the primary structure of individual ORFs.","Kapur, V; Elam, M R; Pawlovich, T M; Murtaugh, M P",The Journal of general virology,194,30

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A double-blind, parallel group study was performed on 305 patients with URTI (nasal airflow resistance [NAR] of > 0.25 Pa cm3 s and a global pain score of at least moderate intensity). NAR and pain relief/intensity scores were measured over 4 h after initial dose. Patients then dosed up to three times daily for 3 days and recorded nasal congestion and pain intensity scores. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Nasal airflow conductance (NAC) and pain relief after the initial dose were primary objectives. NAC was calculated from NAR. Pain relief was measured on a 5-point verbal rating scale (VRS) and pain intensity and nasal congestion on a 4-point VRS. Data were analysed using analysis of covariance. Safety was assessed by adverse events. RESULTS A single dose of the combination was superior to paracetamol and placebo for NAC (p = 0.0001) and was superior to pseudoephedrine and placebo for pain relief (p < or = 0.048). Multiple doses of the combination were also superior to paracetamol and placebo for decongestion (p < or = 0.021) and were superior to pseudoephedrine and placebo for pain reduction (p < or = 0.0057). All treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS The combination treatment provided a greater decongestant effect than either paracetamol or placebo and better pain relief than either pseudoephedrine or placebo.

Heart attacks and strokes are diseases in which platelets play a role, through activation on ruptured plaques and subsequent thrombus formation. Most platelet agonists activate platelets via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which make these receptors ideal targets for many antiplatelet drugs. However, little is known about the mechanisms that provide feedback regulation on GPCRs to limit platelet activation. Emerging evidence from our group and others strongly suggests that GPCR kinases (GRKs) are critical negative regulators during platelet activation and thrombus formation. In this review, we will summarize recent findings on the role of GRKs in platelet biology and how one specific GRK, GRK6, regulates the hemostatic response to vascular injury. Furthermore, we will discuss the potential role of GRKs in thrombotic disorders, such as thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients. Studies on the function of GRKs during platelet activation and thrombus formation have just recently begun, and a better understanding of the role of GRKs in hemostasis and thrombosis will provide a fruitful avenue for understanding the hemostatic response to injury.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements showed that GaAs oxide consists of oxide phases Ga2O3 and As2O3, and the thickness of the Ga2O3 layer is 2-3 times greater than the thickness of As2O3 area-i.e., the oxidized GaAs region consists mainly of Ga2O3. The experimental studies of the influence of ONS thickness on the resistive switching effect were obtained. An increase in the ONS thickness from 0.8 ± 0.3 to 7.6 ± 0.6 nm leads to an increase in the switching voltage Uset from 2.8 ± 0.3 to 6.8 ± 0.9 V. The results can be used in the development of technological processes for the manufacturing of nano-electronic elements, such as ReRAM, as well as a high-efficiency quantum dot laser.","Avilov, Vadim; Polupanov, Nikita; Tominov, Roman; Solodovnik, Maxim; Konoplev, Boris; Smirnov, Vladimir; Ageev, Oleg",,194,16

The World Society of Emergency Surgery conceived this position paper with the purpose of providing evidence-based recommendations for the management of emergency surgical patients under COVID-19 pandemic for the safety of the patient and healthcare workers. METHOD: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) through the MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase and SCOPUS databases. Synthesis of evidence, statements and recommendations were developed in accordance with the GRADE methodology. RESULTS: Given the limitation of the evidence, the current document represents an effort to join selected high-quality articles and experts' opinion. CONCLUSIONS: The aim of this position paper is to provide an exhaustive guidelines to perform emergency surgery in a safe and protected environment for surgical patients and for healthcare workers under COVID-19 and to offer the best management of COVID-19 patients needing for an emergency surgical treatment. We recommend screening for COVID-19 infection at the emergency department all acute surgical patients who are waiting for hospital admission and urgent surgery. The screening work-up provides a RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab test and a baseline (non-contrast) chest CT or a chest X-ray or a lungs US, depending on skills and availability. If the COVID-19 screening is not completed we recommend keeping the patient in isolation until RT-PCR swab test result is not available, and to manage him/she such as an overt COVID patient. The management of COVID-19 surgical patients is multidisciplinary. If an immediate surgical procedure is mandatory, whether laparoscopic or via open approach, we recommend doing every effort to protect the operating room staff for the safety of the patient.","De Simone, Belinda; Chouillard, Elie; Sartelli, Massimo; Biffl, Walter L; Di Saverio, Salomone; Moore, Ernest E; Kluger, Yoram; Abu-Zidan, Fikri M; Ansaloni, Luca; Coccolini, Federico; Leppänemi, Ari; Peitzmann, Andrew B; Pagani, Leonardo; Fraga, Gustavo P; Paolillo, Ciro; Picetti, Edoardo; Valentino, Massimo; Pikoulis, Emmanouil; Baiocchi, Gian Luca; Catena, Fausto",World J Emerg Surg,194,20

The virus first originated in the city of Wuhan in China, causing symptoms such as pneumonic plague, which began in the Wuhan region and then spread throughout the world with high transmission efficiency. Special precautions and care are needed such as leaving the public area, covering your mouth with a mask, not shaking hands, washing hands, and sanitation from time to time. Infection due to SARS-CoV-2 shows several symptoms, one of which is very often the patient shows difficulty breathing. Currently, COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic and has almost attacked all countries in the world, including in India which has one of the largest human populations in the entire world. One of the challenges in handling COVID-19 is the unavailability of drugs or special vaccines to treat the disease, so clinical practitioners and academics are currently testing various drugs to see how they affect the COVID-19 patients. Some of the drugs tested provide effective mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2, such as chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, and vaccines under development, showing efficacy to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. These drugs are still being tested and are now at the forefront to combat the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review article will discuss all kinds of ins and outs of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, including the transmission method, how to prevent it, as well as various drugs and vaccines currently used in handling COVID-19.","Mukim, Mohammad; Kabra, Atul; Devi, Siwani; Chaturvedi, Mohit; Patel, Rakesh",Borneo J.

METHODS: The Mayo Clinic Serology Screening Program was created to provide a voluntary, two-stage testing program for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to health care personnel. The first stage used a dried blood spot screening test initiated on June 15, 2020. Those participants identified as reactive were advised to have confirmatory testing via a venipuncture. Venipuncture results through August 8, 2020, were considered. Consent and authorization for testing was required to participate in the screening program. This report, which was conducted under an institutional review board-approved protocol, only includes employees who have further authorized their records for use in research. RESULTS: A total of 81,113 health care personnel were eligible for the program, and of these 29,606 participated in the screening program. A total of 4284 (14.5%) of the dried blood spot test results were ""reactive"" and warranted confirmatory testing.

Ellagic acid (EA) and Annona muricata (AM) exert antitumor activity against different human tumours. An observational prospective study on the prophylactic effect of oral administration of EA+AM in patients avoiding maintenance regimen is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients affected by NMIBC and not undergoing maintenance after a 6-week course of intravesical prophylaxis with MMC or BCG were entered. Tis and very high-risk tumours were excluded. After informed consent, the patients were subdivided in relation to the oral assumption or not of EA (100 mg) plus AM (100 mg), daily for 6 months. All patients were submitted to 3-month cytology and cystoscopy. RESULTS: 162 (90%) of 180 entered patients are evaluable, 90 and 72 receiving or not EA+AM. No difference emerged in patients' characteristics between the two groups. BCG was given in 86 (54%) and chemotherapy in 74 (46%) patients. The recurrence free rate at 3, 6 and 12 months in patients assuming or not EA was 96.5% versus 84.6% (p = 0.003), 85.4% versus 64.8% (p = 0.005) and 74.2% versus 60.6% (p = 0.246), respectively. The recurrence free survival at 12 months in patients assuming or not EA was 63.0% versus 34.5% (p < 0.0001). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study suffers several limits: not randomized trial although prospective, limited number of patients and short follow-up, nevertheless it shows the prophylactic effect of oral EA+AM in absence of maintenance after intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy induction.","Serretta, Vincenzo; Berardinis, Ettore De; Simonato, Alchiede; Guarneri, Alessio; Dispensa, Nino; Pavone, Carlo; Busetto, Gian Maria; Del Giudice, Francesco; Sanfilippo, Chiara",Urologia,194,13

Especially affected are vulnerable patients in low- and middle-income countries who can only afford access to public health systems. Approach: Soon after physical distancing and curfew orders began on 15 March 2020 in Kenya, we rapidly implemented three supply-chain strategies to ensure a continuous supply of essential medicines while minimizing patients' COVID-19 exposure risks. We redistributed central stocks of medicines to peripheral health facilities to ensure local availability for several months. We equipped smaller, remote health facilities with medicine tackle boxes. We also made deliveries of medicines to patients with difficulty reaching facilities. Local setting: &#932;o implement these strategies we leveraged our 30-year partnership with local health authorities in rural western Kenya and the existing revolving fund pharmacy scheme serving 85 peripheral health centres. Relevant changes: In April 2020, stocks of essential chronic and non-chronic disease medicines redistributed to peripheral health facilities increased to 835 140 units, as compared with 316 330 units in April 2019. We provided medicine tackle boxes to an additional 46 health facilities. Our team successfully delivered medications to 264 out of 311 patients (84.9%) with noncommunicable diseases whom we were able to reach. Lessons learnt: Our revolving fund pharmacy model has ensured that patients' access to essential medicines has not been interrupted during the pandemic. Success was built on a community approach to extend pharmaceutical services, adapting our current supply-chain infrastructure and working quickly in partnership with local health authorities.","Tran, Dan N; Were, Phelix M; Kangogo, Kibet; Amisi, James A; Manji, Imran; Pastakia, Sonak D; Vedanthan, Rajesh",Bull World Health Organ,194,1

Higher education institutions need to equip their graduates with International Online Collaboration Competencies (IOCCs), but research into these is fragmented, lacking even a definition of these competencies. This study was systematically reviewing empirical studies on IOCCs. 516 studies were reviewed, and data from 14 full texts were analyzed. Six competence domains emerged from the literature. Most studies focused on single domains of IOCCs, and none of the studies covered all domains. Results indicate that this preliminary framework for higher education students provides a first overview of the fragmented literature on IOCCs. Methods to teach and evaluate IOCCs acquisition are underdeveloped but urgently needed to equip professionals for global virtual teamwork.","Kolm, Alexandra de Nooijer Jascha Vanherle Koen Werkman Andrea Wewerka-Kreimel Daniela Rachman-Elbaum Shelly van Merriënboer Jeroen J.

First, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to analyze the H-bond network that may serve as a Grotthuss-like proton conduit. MD simulations show that D1-Asp61, the H-bond acceptor of H2O at the Mn4CaO5 cluster (W1), forms an H-bond via one water molecule with D1-Glu65 but not with D2-Glu312. Then, D1-Asp61, D1-Glu65, D2-Glu312, and the adjacent residues, D1-Arg334, D2-Glu302, and D1-Glu323, were thoroughly mutated to the other 19 residues, i.e., 114 Chlamydomonas chloroplast mutant cells were generated. Mutation of D1-Asp61 was most crucial. Only the D61E and D61C cells grew photoautotrophically and exhibit O2-evolving activity. Mutations of D2-Glu312 were less crucial to photosynthetic growth than mutations of D1-Glu65. Quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations indicated that in the PSII crystal structure, the proton is predominantly localized at D1-Glu65 along the H-bond with D2-Glu312, i.e., pKa(D1-Glu65)â¯>â¯pKa(D2-Glu312). The potential-energy profile shows that the release of the proton from D1-Glu65 leads to the formation of the two short H-bonds between D1-Asp61 and D1-Glu65, which facilitates downhill proton transfer along the Grotthuss-like proton conduit in the S2 to S3 transition. However, inhibitions of photosynthetic growth were absent in the E65K and E65H mutants. It seems possible that D1-Glu65 is involved in the dominant pathway that proceeds from W1 via D1-Asp61 toward the thylakoid lumen, whereas D2-Glu312 and D1-Arg334 are used as alternative pathways in some mutants.","Kuroda, Hiroshi; Kawashima, Keisuke; Ueda, Kazuyo; Ikeda, Takuya; Saito, Keisuke; Ninomiya, Ryo; Hida, Chisato; Takahashi, Yuichiro; Ishikita, Hiroshi",Biochim Biophys Acta Bioenerg,194,30

We examined factors associated with food worry during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We collected survey data on worry about food shortages, worry about contracting COVID-19, and concerns about DHH people staying home and being lonely from April 17 through May 1, 2020, via a bilingual American Sign Language/English online survey platform. The sample consisted of 537 DHH adults living in the United States. We examined the relationship between demographic characteristics and food worry. We used logistic regression and model fitting to predict the likelihood of experiencing food worry. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of survey respondents was 47 (16), and 25% of the sample identified as people of color. Forty-two percent of survey respondents had a high level of food worry. Increased worry about contracting COVID-19 and concerns about DHH people staying home and being lonely among DHH younger adults or those without a college degree predicted food worry. Gender and race/ethnicity did not contribute to the model for food worry. CONCLUSIONS: Food worry was explained by multiple, intersecting factors, including demographic variables, worry about contracting COVID-19, and concerns about loneliness. Interventions or programs implemented by DHH-serving organizations as well as government programs, social service providers, and food banks should be fully accessible to subgroups of DHH young adults without a college degree who are at risk for food insecurity.","Engelman, Alina; Paludneviciene, Raylene; Wagner, Kathryn; Jacobs, Katja; Kushalnagar, Poorna",Public Health Rep,194,16

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are lethal species caused by human coronaviruses (HCoVs). Currently, a novel strain of HCoVs, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).

The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 and a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in late January 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory tract causing flu-like symptoms and, in some, may cause severe illness like pneumonia and multi-organ failure leading to death.

The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen.","Shanmugaraj, Balamurugan; Siriwattananon, Konlavat; Wangkanont, Kittikhun; Phoolcharoen, Waranyoo",Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol,194,23

METHODS: We compared two cohorts of patients undergoing head and neck or reconstructive surgery between March 16, 2019 and April 16, 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and March 16, 2020 and April 16, 2020 (COVID-19) at an academic center. Perioperative, intraoperative, and postoperative outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: There were 63 operations during COVID-19 and 84 operations during pre-COVID-19. During COVID-19, a smaller proportion of patients had benign pathology (12% vs 20%, respectively) and underwent thyroid procedures (2% vs 23%) while a greater proportion of patients underwent microvascular reconstruction±ablation (24% vs 12%,). Operative times increased, especially among patients undergoing microvascular reconstruction±ablation (687 ± 112 vs 596 ± 91 minutes, P = .04). Complication rates and length of stay were similar. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, perioperative outcomes were similar, operative time increased, and there were no recorded transmissions to staff or patients.

Utilizing our most recent application of this model to a rapid qualitative appraisal of health care workers' experiences delivering care during the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study, we identify the steps to put this model into practice and its main outcomes. Our application of the model revealed that the team's practices could be grouped along four dimensions: design assumptions, data collection and analysis processes, multidisciplinary collaboration, and responsible dissemination. Reflexivity can improve the relations within the team and the quality of the research output, if it is implemented as a continuous and iterative process.","Rankl, Felicia; Johnson, Ginger A; Vindrola-Padros, Cecilia",Qual Health Res,194,20

This study aimed to synthesize evidence for the role and response of palliative care and hospice teams to viral epidemics/pandemics and inform the COVID-19 pandemic response. We conducted a rapid systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in five databases. Of 3094 articles identified, 10 were included in this narrative synthesis. Included studies were from West Africa, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the U.S., and Italy. All had an observational design. Findings were synthesized using a previously proposed framework according to systems (policies, training and protocols, communication and coordination, and data), staff (deployment, skill mix, and resilience), space (community provision and use of technology), and stuff (medicines and equipment as well as personal protective equipment). We conclude that hospice and palliative services have an essential role in the response to COVID-19 by responding rapidly and flexibly; ensuring protocols for symptom management are available, and training nonspecialists in their use; being involved in triage; considering shifting resources into the community; considering redeploying volunteers to provide psychosocial and bereavement care; facilitating camaraderie among staff and adopting measures to deal with stress; using technology to communicate with patients and carers; and adopting standardized data collection systems to inform operational changes and improve care.","Etkind, Simon N; Bone, Anna E; Lovell, Natasha; Cripps, Rachel L; Harding, Richard; Higginson, Irene J; Sleeman, Katherine E",J Pain Symptom Manage,194,16

We acquired samples from all suspected cases and their contacts during the first month of the pandemic from Tygerberg Hospital. Nanopore sequencing generated SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes. Phylogenetic inference with maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods were used to determine lineages that seeded the local epidemic. Three patients were known to have travelled internationally and an outbreak was detected in a nearby supermarket. Sequencing of 50 samples produced 46 high-quality genomes. The sequences were classified as lineages: B, B.1, B.1.1.1, B.1.1.161, B.1.1.29, B.1.8, B.39, and B.40. All the sequences from persons under investigation (PUIs) in the supermarket outbreak (lineage B.1.8) fall within a clade from the Netherlands with good support (p > 0.9). In addition, a new mutation, 5209A>G, emerged within the Cape Town cluster. The molecular clock analysis suggests that this occurred around 13 March 2020 (95% confidence interval: 9-17 March). The phylogenetic reconstruction suggests at least nine early introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Cape Town and an early localized transmission in a shopping environment. Genomic surveillance was successfully used to investigate and track the spread of early introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in Cape Town.","Engelbrecht, Susan; Delaney, Kayla; Kleinhans, Bronwyn; Wilkinson, Eduan; Tegally, Houriiyah; Stander, Tania; van Zyl, Gert; Preiser, Wolfgang; de Oliveira, Tulio",Viruses,194,16

OBJECTIVE: To provide a critical synthesis of the scientific literature on the pandemic's implications for psychiatric practice. METHODS: A rapid literature review was undertaken to identify scientific literature linking psychiatric outcomes and practice changes due to coronavirus and the disease it causes (COVID-19). A structured quality assessment was used to assess those articles reporting quantitative data. RESULTS: Fifty articles were identified for inclusion, but only 12 contained original data. Eleven of those twelve were rated as of weak quality. The literature described psychiatric sequelae of the coronavirus and related public health interventions through cross-sectional surveys among different populations;no studies include diagnostic or functional impairment data. Populations at risk include COVID-19 survivors, health care workers, the elderly, and those with preexisting psychiatric disease. Impacts on psychiatric practice were described, again without data on changes to quality or access of care. CONCLUSIONS: There is a quickly accumulating body of evidence on the psychiatric implications of coronavirus including psychological effects on the general public and at-risk subgroups. Similarly, psychiatric practice has witnessed substantial adaptation to the pandemic. However, there remain significant gaps in scientific knowledge.

Existing regulations are primarily unprepared to provide guidance for such a rapidly evolving field and accommodate devices that rely on machine learning and AI. Moreover, the field of healthcare robotics is very rich and extensive, but it is still very much scattered and unclear in terms of definitions, medical and technical classifications, product characteristics, purpose, and intended use. As a result, these devices often navigate between the medical device regulation or other non-medical norms, such as the ISO personal care standard. Before regulating the field of healthcare robots, it is therefore essential to map the major state-of-the-art developments in healthcare robotics, their capabilities and applications, and the challenges we face as a result of their integration within the healthcare environment. This contribution fills in this gap and lack of clarity currently experienced within healthcare robotics and its governance by providing a structured overview of and further elaboration on the main categories now established, their intended purpose, use, and main characteristics. We explicitly focus on surgical, assistive, and service robots to rightfully match the definition of healthcare as the organized provision of medical care to individuals, including efforts to maintain, treat, or restore physical, mental, or emotional well-being.

Social distancing measures changed this. The Cleveland Clinic Internal Medicine Residency Programme (IMRP) is one of the largest programmes in the USA, which made the task of implementing a telemedicine curriculum more complex. Here we describe our experience implementing an effective, expedited telemedicine curriculum for our ambulatory resident clinics. This study was started in April 2020 when we implemented a resident-led curriculum and training programme for providing ambulatory telemedicine care. The curriculum was finalised in less than 5 weeks. It entailed introducing a formal training programme for residents, creating a resource guide for different video communication tools and training preceptors to safely supervise care in this new paradigm. Residents were surveyed before the curriculum to assess prior experience with telemedicine, and then afterward to assess the curriculum's effectiveness. We also created a mini-CEX assessment for residents to solicit feedback on their performance during virtual appointments. Over 2000 virtual visits were performed by residents in a span of 10 weeks. Of 148 residents, 38% responded to the pre-participation survey. A majority had no prior telemedicine experience and expressed only slight comfort with the modality. Through collaboration with experienced residents and faculty, we expeditiously deployed an enhancement to our ambulatory care curriculum to teach residents how to provide virtual care and help faculty with supervision. We share our insights on this experience for other residency programmes to use.","Savage, David J; Gutierrez, Omar; Montané, Bryce Edward; Singh, Achintya Dinesh; Yudelevich, Eric; Mahar, Jamal; Brateanu, Andrei; Khatri, Lakshmi; Fleisher, Catherine; Jolly, Stacey E",Postgrad. med. j,194,24

A clearly noticeable improvement in working conditions for nurses as a result of the political efforts of this legislative period has so far failed to materialise to the same extent as the active involvement of nurses in political decisions and resolutions that directly affect the professional group. The rapid build-up of bed capacities has made it possible to provide the patients concerned with the necessary intensive medical care.

We reported 2 cases of Coronavirus Disease 19 receiving tracheal intubation twice during the hospitalization. PATIENT CONCERNS: Two elderly patients with onset of fever and upper respiratory tract infection were confirmed as Coronavirus Disease 19, 1 of whom had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease previously. With active antiviral and noninvasive respiratory supportive therapy, there was no improvement, thus mechanical ventilation (MV) was adopted. Combining with symptomatic and supportive treatment, their oxygenation recovered and then extubation was carried out. However, 96âhours later, they underwent endotracheal intubation again due to their Coronavirus Disease 19 progression. DIAGNOSIS: Critically ill Coronavirus Disease 19 requiring tracheal intubation owing to respiratory failure with lung.javascript. INTERVENTIONS: Initial Strategy for respiratory failure included endotracheal intubation, MV, antiviral treatment and cortisol in both cases. When extubation criteria were satisfied, early discontinuation of MV was conducted, then rehabilitation exercise and nutritional support followed. However, 96âhours later, the disease progressed leading to respiratory failure again, thus reintubation was performed. Later, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed owing to aggravation of respiratory failure, assisted by prone position treatment and sputum drainage, then status became stable and stepped into recovery stage. OUTCOMES: Both patients underwent reintubation, and their MV time and Intensive care unit residence time were prolonged. Through prone position treatment, sputum drainage and awake extracorporeal membrane oxygenation strategy, patient has been transferred to rehabilitation unit in Case 1, and patient in Case 2 has been in recovery stage as well with stable pulmonary status and was expected to receive evaluation in recent future. LESSONS: Course of Coronavirus Disease 19 is relatively longer, and failure rate of simple early extubation seemes higher. To reduce the likelihood of reintubation and iatrogenic injury, individualized assessment is recommended.","Zhang, Jingchen; He, Xujian; Hu, Jia; Li, Tong",Medicine (Baltimore),194,23

METHODS: Retrospective cohort of 326 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 through April 19, 2020. Sociodemographic and hospital course data were collected and analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented to examine associations. RESULTS: Compared with non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), Hispanics were younger (53 years, median age) and had higher rates of Medicaid and less commercial/HMO/PPO coverage (P < .001). Similarly, in the age sub-grouped multivariate analysis for outcomes, Hispanics &#8805;65-year-old were 2.66 times more likely to be admitted to ICU (95% CI: 1.07-6.61; P = .03), and 3.67 times more likely to get intubated (95% CI: 1.29-10.36; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized Hispanic patients of &#8805;65-year-old with COVID-19 were more likely to have higher risk of more severe outcomes (ICU admission and intubation) compared with NHW. Hispanic patient's social determinants of health and underlying medical conditions may explain the heightened risk for severe outcomes.

The qualitative data was coded, and thematic analysis used to identify themes. The results show a high level of awareness and knowledge of the transmission and prevention of SARS-CoV-2. Qualitative data revealed that there is awareness of elderly people and those with immunocompromised conditions being more vulnerable to catching Covid-19. However, misconceptions of being protected against the virus or having low or no risk were also evident in the data. We found that false information circulated on social media not only instigated confusion, fear and panic, but also contributed to the construction of misconceptions, othering and stigmatizing responses to Covid-19. The study findings bring attention to the importance of developing communication materials adapted to specific communities to help reduce misconceptions, othering and stigmatization around Covid-19.","Schmidt, Tenielle; Cloete, Allanise; Davids, Adlai; Makola, Lehlogonolo; Zondi, Nokubonga; Jantjies, Monalisa",PLoS One,194,20

This rapid uptake creates major challenges for conducting COVID-19 clinical research studies, because quickly evolving standards make it difficult to adapt in real time. The rapid dissemination and implementation of COVID-19 interventions is the realization of goals long pursued by the implementation science community. However, the downside of the rapid implementation is that low-quality evidence with little to no scientific vetting may be quickly integrated into clinical care, resulting in lost opportunities to advance our scientific understanding about how to manage infected patients. In the future, novel adaptive designs embedded into electronic health records (Embedded Quantified, Integrated-into-Practice Trial [EQuIPT] designs) that allow for easier and better access to clinical trials may simultaneously improve care and advance healthcare innovations.","Branch-Elliman, Westyn; Elwy, A Rani; Monach, Paul",Open Forum Infect Dis,194,16

The researchers across the globe are struggling hard to search a drug to treat this infection. Understanding the time constraint, the best approach is to study clinically approved drugs for control of this deadly pandemic of COVID 19. The repurposing of such drugs can be supported with the study of molecular interactions to enhance the possibility of application. The present work is a molecular docking study of proteins responsible for viral propagation namely 3Clpro, Nsp10/16, Spike protein, SARS protein receptor binding domain, Nsp 9 viral single strand binding protein and viral helicase. The protein through virus enters the host cell-human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, is also used as a target for molecular docking. The docking was done with most discussed drugs for SARS-CoV-2 like Ritonavir, Lopinavir, Remdesivir, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), routine antiviral drugs like Oseltamivir and Ribavirin. In addition, small molecules with anti-inflammatory actions like Mycophenolic acid (MPA), Pemirolast, Isoniazid and Eriodictyol were also tested. The generated data confirms the potential of Ritonavir, Lopinavir and Remdesivir as a therapeutic candidate against SARS-CoV-2. It is observed that Eriodictyol binds to almost all selected target proteins with good binding energy, suggesting its importance in treatment of COVID 19. Molecular interactions of Ritonavir, Lopinavir and Remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 proteins enhanced their potential as a candidate drug for treatment of COVID-19. Eriodictyol had emerged as a new repurposing drug that can be used in COVID-19.","Deshpande, Rujuta R; Tiwari, Arpita Pandey; Nyayanit, Narendra; Modak, Manisha",Eur J Pharmacol,194,17

In squat B, 65 (54%) persons were screened at three different times, and only two were found positive. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Discrepant outcomes may reflect different levels of sanitation, prevention, and acceptance of interventions. Refusal to be transferred to specific COVID-19 homes if tested positive underscores the importance of local sanitary solutions for all.

A vital step in the battle against it is the successful screening of infected patients, together with one of the effective screening methods being radiology examination using chest radiography. Recognition of epidemic growth patterns across temporal and social factors can improve our capability to create epidemic transmission designs, including the critical job of predicting the estimated intensity of the outbreak morbidity or mortality impact at the end. The study's primary motivation is to be able to estimate with a certain level of accuracy the number of deaths due to COVID-19, managing to model the progression of the pandemic. Predicting the number of possible deaths from COVID-19 can provide governments and decision-makers with indicators for purchasing respirators and pandemic prevention policies. Thus, this work presents itself as an essential contribution to combating the pandemic. Kalman Filter is a widely used method for tracking and navigation and filtering and time series. Designing and tuning machine learning methods are a labor- and time-intensive task that requires extensive experience. The field of automated machine learning Auto Machine Learning relies on automating this task. Auto Machine Learning tools enable novice users to create useful machine learning units, while experts can use them to free up valuable time for other tasks. This paper presents an objective method of forecasting the COVID-19 outbreak using Kalman Filter and Auto Machine Learning. We use a COVID-19 dataset of Ceará, one of the 27 federative units in Brazil. Ceará has more than 235,222 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 8850 deaths due to the disease.

This hypothesis-generating report aims to identify the United States and Canadian trends of coronavirus disease 2019 in PICUs. DESIGN AND SETTING: To better understand how the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic was affecting U.S. and Canadian PICUs, an open voluntary daily data collection process of Canadian and U.S. PICUs was initiated by Virtual Pediatric Systems, LLC (Los Angeles, CA; http://www.myvps.org) in mid-March 2020. Information was made available online to all PICUs wishing to participate. A secondary data collection was performed to follow-up on patients discharged from those PICUs reporting coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: To date, over 180 PICUs have responded detailing 530 PICU admissions requiring over 3,467 days of PICU care with 30 deaths. The preponderance of cases was in the eastern regions. Twenty-four percent of the patients admitted to the PICUs were over 18 years old. Fourteen percent of admissions were under 2 years old. Nearly 60% of children had comorbidities at admission with the average length of stay increasing by age and by severity of comorbidity. Advanced respiratory support was necessary during 67% of the current days of care, with 69% being conventional mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: PICUs have been significantly impacted by the pandemic. They have provided care not only for children but also adults. Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 have a high frequency of comorbidities, require longer stays, more ventilatory support than usual PICU admissions. These data suggest several avenues for further exploration.","Sachdeva, Ramesh; Rice, Tom B; Reisner, Brian; Brundage, Nancy; Hulbert, Cheryl; Kaminski, Alex; Wetzel, Randall C",Pediatr Crit Care Med,194,30

In particular, resource-limited areas need simple and easily disseminated testing solutions to manage the outbreak. In this work, a microfluidic-integrated lateral flow recombinase polymerase amplification (MI-IF-RPA) assay was developed for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2, which integrates the reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) and a universal lateral flow (LF) dipstick detection system into a single microfluidic chip. The single-chamber RT-RPA reaction components are mixed with running buffer, and then delivered to the LF detection strips for biotin- and FAM-labelled amplified analyte sequences, which can provide easily interpreted positive or negative results. Testing requires only a simple nucleic acid extraction and loading, then incubation to obtain results, approximately 30 minutes in total. SARS-CoV-2 armored RNA particles were used to validate the MI-IF-RPA system, which showed a limit of detection of 1 copy per µL, or 30 copies per sample. Chip performance was further evaluated using clinically diagnosed cases of COVID-19 and revealed a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 100%, highly comparable to current reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based diagnostic assays. This MI-IF-RPA assay is portable and comprises affordable materials, enabling mass production and decreased risk of contamination. Without the need for specialized instrumentation and training, MI-IF-RPA assay can be used as a complement to RT-PCR for low-cost COVID-19 screening in resource-limited areas.","Liu, Dan; Shen, Haicong; Zhang, Yuqian; Shen, Danyu; Zhu, Mingyang; Song, Yanling; Zhu, Zhi; Yang, Chaoyong",Lab Chip,194,1

Autoimmune neutropenia is a relatively uncommon hematological disorder characterized by the autoantibody-induced destruction of neutrophils. It is usually triggered by viral infections with very few documented cases after influenza virus. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-month-old male infant presented at the emergency room with a 5-days history of fever up to 39.7 °C, cough and runny nose. In the blood test performed, severe neutropenia was diagnosed (neutrophils 109/µL). A nasopharyngeal aspirate revealed a positive rapid test for Influenza A. Serum antineutrophil antibodies were determined with positive results. Neutropenia targeted panel showed no mutations. Despite maintenance of severe neutropenia for 9 months the course was uneventful without treatment. CONCLUSIONS: When severe neutropenia is diagnosed and confirmed, it is essential to rule out some potential etiologies and underlying conditions, since the appropriate subsequent management will depend on it. Although autoimmune neutropenia triggered by viral infections has been widely reported, it has seldom been reported after influenza infection.

Although emerging studies have identified lymphopenia as a driver of cytokine storm, disease progression, and poor outcomes in infected patients, its immunopathogenesis, as well as environmental and genetic determinants, remain unclear. Understanding the interplay of these determinants in the context of lymphopenia and COVID-19 complications in patients in Africa may help with risk stratification and appropriate deployment of targeted treatment regimens with repurposed drugs to improve prognosis. OBJECTIVE: This study is designed to investigate the role of vitamin D status, vasculopathy, apoptotic pathways, and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms in the immunopathogenesis of lymphopenia among African people infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This cross-sectional study will enroll 230 participants, categorized as ""SARS-CoV-2 negative"" (n=69), ""COVID-19 mild"" (n=32), ""hospitalized"" (n=92), and ""recovered"" (n=37), from two health facilities in Lagos, Nigeria. Sociodemographic data, travel history, and information on comorbidities will be obtained from case files and through a pretested, interview-based structured questionnaire. Venous blood samples (5 mL) collected between 8 AM and 10 AM and aliquoted into EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and plain tubes will be used for complete blood count and CD4 T cell assays to determine lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <1000 cells/µL) and CD4 T lymphocyte levels, as well as to measure the concentrations of vitamin D, caspase 3, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) using an autoanalyzer, flow cytometry, and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) techniques. Genomic DNA will be extracted from the buffy coat and used as a template for the amplification of apoptosis-related genes (Bax, Bcl-2, BCL2L12) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genotyping of VDR (Apa1, Fok1, and Bsm1) gene polymorphisms by the PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism method and capillary sequencing. Total RNA will also be extracted, reverse transcribed, and subsequently quantitated by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to monitor the expression of apoptosis genes in the four participant categories. Data analyses, which include a test of association between VDR gene polymorphisms and study outcomes (lymphopenia and hypovitaminosis D prevalence, mild/moderate and severe infections) will be performed using the R statistical software. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium analyses for the alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes of the genotyped VDR gene will also be carried out. RESULTS: A total of 45 participants comprising 37 SARS-CoV-2-negative and 8 COVID-19-recovered individuals have been enrolled so far. Their complete blood counts and CD4 T lymphocyte counts have been determined, and their serum samples and genomic DNA and RNA samples have been extracted and stored at -20 °C until further analyses. Other expected outcomes include the prevalence and distribution of lymphopenia and hypovitaminosis D in the control (SARS-CoV-2 negative), confirmed, hospitalized, and recovered SARS-CoV-2-positive participants; association of lymphopenia with CD4 T lymphocyte level, serum vitamin D, sVCAM-1, sFasL, and caspase 3 levels in hospitalized patients with COVID-19; expression levels of apoptosis-related genes among hospitalized participants with COVID-19, and those with lymphopenia compared to those without lymphopenia; and frequency distribution of the alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes of VDR gene polymorphisms in COVID-19-infected participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study will aid in the genotypic and phenotypic stratification of COVID-19-infected patients in Nigeria with and without lymphopenia to enable biomarker discovery and pave the way for the appropriate and timely deployment of patient-centered treatments to improve prognosis.

In this context, fludioxonil-contaminated wastewater was treated in an upflow immobilized cell bioreactor, resulting in chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency even higher than 80%, whereas the electrical conductivity (EC) of the effluent was gradually increased. Organic-F was mineralized by 94.0 ± 5.2%, which was in accordance with the high fludioxonil removal efficiency (95.4 ± 4.0%). In addition, effluent total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) concentration reduced significantly during bioprocessing. A strong relationship among COD removal, TKN/total nitrogen removal, and effluent EC increase (p < 0.01) was identified. Despite the adequate aeration provided, effluent nitrite and nitrate concentrations were negligible. Illumina sequencing revealed a reduction in the relative abundances of Betaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, and Firmicutes and an increase in the proportion of Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria. A shift in bacterial communities occurred during fludioxonil treatment, resulting in the significant increase of the relative abundances of Empedobacter, Sphingopyxis, and Rhodopseudomonas (from 0.67 ± 0.13% at the start-up to 34.34 ± 1.60% at the end of biotreatment).

Moreover, there are many applications in which we have found it very difficult to directly obtain the expected dynamic load which acts on a structure. Some traditional indirect inverse analysis techniques are developed for load identification by measured responses. These inverse problems about load identification mentioned above are complex and inherently ill-posed, while regularization methods can deal with this kind of problem. However, most of regularization methods are only limited to solve the pure mathematical numerical examples without application to practical engineering problems, and they should be improved to exclude jamming of noises in engineering. In order to solve these problems, a new regularization method is presented in this article to investigate the minimum of this minimization problem, and applied to reconstructing multi-source dynamic loads on the frame structure of hydrogenerator by its steady-state responses. Numerical simulations of the inverse analysis show that the proposed method is more effective and accurate than the famous Tikhonov regularization method. The proposed regularization method in this article is powerful in solving the dyanmic load identification problems.","Wang, Linjun; Huang, Yang; Xie, Youxiang; Du, Yixian",Sci Prog,194,5

We found that the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains a furin cleavage site, which did not exist in any other betacoronavirus subtype B. Based on a series of analysis, we speculate that the presence of a redundant furin cut site in its Spike protein is responsible for SARS-CoV-2's stronger infectious nature than other coronaviruses, which leads to higher membrane fusion efficiency. Subsequently, a library of 4,000 compounds including approved drugs and natural products was screened against furin through structure-based virtual screening and then assayed for their inhibitory effects on furin activity. Among them, an anti-parasitic drug, diminazene, showed the highest inhibition effects on furin with an IC50 of 5.42 ± 0.11 µM, which might be used for the treatment of COVID-19.","Wu, Canrong; Zheng, Mengzhu; Yang, Yueying; Gu, Xiaoxia; Yang, Kaiyin; Li, Mingxue; Liu, Yang; Zhang, Qingzhe; Zhang, Peng; Wang, Yali; Wang, Qiqi; Xu, Yang; Zhou, Yirong; Zhang, Yonghui; Chen, Lixia; Li, Hua",iScience,194,1

The pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus is no exception. This study's objective is to identify symptoms of work-related stress, anxiety and fear of COVID-19 in physicians, as well as to discover their relation with the territorial body in which they work. Methodology: This is a cross-cutting study that explored the symptoms and perceptions of Colombian physicians forced to quarantine, who exercised their profession in March, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Having provided informed consent anonymously and voluntarily, participants completed a virtual form with general questions on COVID-19. The survey was aimed at finding psychosomatic problems using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and Fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19S) scale. Participants were classified as working in non-capital or capital municipalities according to the territorial body in which they practiced. Logistic regression between the territorial body (which was taken as an independent variable here) and symptoms of anxiety, work-related stress and fear of COVID-19 (which, in this case, were taken as dependent variables) was performed. Results: Five hundred and thirty-one general physicians participated, with an average age of 30. Seventy-three point three percent practiced in a capital municipality. One third of the surveyed physicians presented mild work-related stress, while 6% presented high or severe work-related stress, without differences between groups (p < 0.05). Symptoms of anxiety were found in 72.9% of the surveyed physicians, more frequently among those who practiced in capitals (p = 0.044). Thirty-seven point one percent presented symptoms of fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19S). No relation was observed in the logistic regression. Discussion: Psychosocial and psychosomatic factors associated with fear are the common denominators of symptoms of anxiety and work-related stress during pandemics. Conclusion: Seven of every ten participants presented symptoms of anxiety or work-related stress, while four presented symptoms of FCV-19S. No relation was observed with the municipalities in which they worked. Cómo citar. Monterrosa-Castro A, Dávila-Ruiz R, Mejía-Mantilla A, Contreras-Saldarriaga J, Mercado-Lara M, Flores-Monterrosa C.

As a consequence, all teaching and learning processes had been conducted through e-learning. Although elearning, some of the teachers still used conventional models. They only sended material files and questions to students. Mathematics learning like this certainly did not give students enthusiasm for learning. Moreover, students are not used to getting various questions. Students had difficulty working on material development questions. This could be because conventional learning did not hone the ability to think reflective. For that reason, this research aimed at testing the computer- based drill learning and the conventional learning model through e-learning. The aspect that would be measured was the students' mathematical reflecting thinking. The research method was quasi-experimental by employing the pretest before the treatment and the posttest after the treatment. The research design employed two classes, the 26 students of the control class and 24 ones of the experiment class. The result revealed that a computer-based drilling learning model would be effective if it was viewed from the perspective of students' mathematical reflective thinking ability. On the other hand, the conventional learning model would not be effectively viewed from students' mathematical reflective thinking. This study's main contribution was the results of testing a learning model suitable for use during the Covid-19 pandemic.

This study sought to determine the levels of KAP toward COVID-19 among residents of north-central Nigeria. A cross-sectional online survey with a semi-structured questionnaire using a Snowball sampling technique was conducted during the national lockdown. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson's correlation and regression tests. From a total of 589 responses received, 80.6, 59.6, 90.4 and 56.2% were from respondents between ages 18-39 years, males, had a college (Bachelor) degree or above and reside in urban areas respectively. Respondents had good knowledge (99.5%) of COVID-19, gained mainly through the internet/social media (55.7%) and Television (27.5%). The majority of the respondents (79.5%) had positive attitudes toward the adherence of government IPC measures with 92.7, 96.4 and 82.3% practicing social distancing/self-isolation, improved personal hygiene and using face mask respectively. However, 52.1% of the respondents perceived that the government is not doing enough to curtail COVID-19 in Nigeria.

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics position statement summarizes the nutrient needs of older adults (aged &#8805;60 years) based on a systematic review. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare nutrient intake of Women's Health Initiative Long Life Study participants to the Dietary Reference Intakes for nutrients reviewed in the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics position statement. DESIGN: The study is a cross-sectional analysis. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants (n=7,875) were mailed the General Nutrition Assessment Food Frequency Questionnaire during 2012-2013, of whom 77% (n=6,095) completed it, and 5,732 were included in the analytic sample after exclusion for implausible energy intakes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean intake of energy and protein, calcium, fiber, folate, potassium, sodium, vitamins B-12, D, E, and K were described overall and compared with recommendations. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Demographic and lifestyle characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. The proportion of participants meeting recommendations was computed. RESULTS: Mean age of completers was 79±7 years and 53.5% were non-Hispanic white, 30% were non-Hispanic black, and 16.5% were Hispanic/Latina. Only one-third of women consumed &#8805;21 g/day fiber, whereas fewer met the Recommended Dietary Allowance for calcium (18.6%), vitamin E (16.9%), and vitamin D (1.7%). Just more than half (56%) of participants met the Recommended Dietary Allowance for protein of 0.8 g/kg body weight/day, and just less than half (47.0%) met potassium guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest older women within the Women's Health Initiative were generally not achieving recommended intake for several key nutrients highlighted by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics position statement. These findings underscore the need to identify effective approaches for improving the nutrient density of dietary intake in older women.","Beasley, Jeannette M; Rillamas-Sun, Eileen; Tinker, Lesley F; Wylie-Rosett, Judith; Mossavar-Rahmani, Yasmin; Datta, Mridul; Caan, Bette J; LaCroix, Andrea Z",Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,194,1

It is very contagious and is spreading rapidly around the world. Until now, coronaviruses have mainly been associated with the aerodigestive tract due to the presence of a monobasic cleavage site for the resident transmembrane serine protease 2. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 is equipped with a second, polybasic cleavage site for the ubiquitous furin protease, which may determine the widespread tissue tropism. Furthermore, the terminal sequence of the furin-cleaved spike protein also binds to neuropilin receptors. Clinically, there is enormous variability in the severity of the disease. Severe consequences are seen in a relatively small number of patients, most show moderate symptoms, but asymptomatic cases, especially among young people, drive disease spread.

Therefore, COVID-19 is dangerous and unpredictable and has become the most serious threat for generations.

These include increased exposure to household cleaning products, chemicals and lead in dust, indoor air pollutants, screen time, family stress, and firearms, as well as decreased availability of food, social supports, and routine childhood screenings. Importantly, many of these threats disproportionately affect children of racial or ethnic minorities or who have low socioeconomic status. Pediatric health care providers will need to screen and treat children and counsel their parents and/or other caregivers during well-child visits with an eye for these new or worsened environmental threats.

This murine virus is used as a common model to study acute and chronic virus-induced demyelination in the central nervous system. Studies with recombinant MHV strains that differ in the gene encoding the spike protein have demonstrated that the spike has a role in MHV pathogenesis and retrograde axonal transport. Fusion peptides (FPs) in the spike protein play a key role in MHV pathogenesis. In a previous study of the effect of deleting a single proline residue in the FP of a demyelinating MHV strain, we found that two central, consecutive prolines are important for cell-cell fusion and pathogenesis. The dihedral fluctuation of the FP was shown to be repressed whenever two consecutive prolines were present, in contrast to the presence of a single proline in the chain. Using this proline-deleted MHV strain, here we investigated whether intracranial injection of this strain can induce optic neuritis by retrograde axonal transport from the brain to the retina through the optic nerve. We observed that the proline-deleted recombinant MHV strain is restricted to the optic nerve, is unable to translocate to the retina, and causes only minimal demyelination and no neuronal death. We conclude that an intact proline dyad in the FP of the recombinant demyelinating MHV strain plays a crucial role in translocation of the virus through axons and subsequent neurodegeneration.","Rout, Saurav Saswat; Singh, Manmeet; Shindler, Kenneth S; Das Sarma, Jayasri",J Biol Chem,194,10

The lack of herd immunity against this virus and the possibility of viral spread from asymptomatic individuals is still a major challenge for the prevention of viral transmission. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of the virus in different bodily secretions as a potential source of viral spread among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. STUDY DESIGN: Cross Sectional Study. METHODS: The study included 38 COVID-19 patients with a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result for SARS-CoV-2, obtained from the combined nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swab samples. Saliva, tear, and cerumen samples were taken from the patients within 72 hours of the first RT-PCR test. SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 gene regions were studied with single-step RT-PCR in all samples. RESULTS: Among the studied samples, the highest positivity rate was in saliva (76.3%) followed by tears (55.3%) and cerumen (39.5%). Viral load in saliva was also significantly higher compared to tears and cerumen (P < .001), while there was no significant difference between tears and cerumen. Higher viral load in combined nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swab samples was associated with higher viral load in tears, but not in saliva or cerumen. Half of the saliva, tear, and cerumen samples obtained from asymptomatic patients contained SARS-CoV-2 genome. CONCLUSIONS: The virus was detected in the saliva, tears, and cerumen samples of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The potential role of these bodily fluids on viral spread needs to be studied.

One of the main interests in network analysis is the online detection of anomalous behaviour. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, we introduce a network surveillance method bringing together network modelling and statistical process control. Our approach is to apply multivariate control charts based on exponential smoothing and cumulative sums in order to monitor networks determined by temporal exponential random graph models (TERGM). This allows us to account for temporal dependence, while simultaneously reducing the number of parameters to be monitored. The performance of the proposed charts is evaluated by calculating the average run length for both simulated and real data. To prove the appropriateness of the TERGM to describe network data, some measures of goodness of fit are inspected. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by an empirical application, monitoring daily flights in the United States to detect anomalous patterns.","Malinovskaya, Anna; Otto, Philipp",,194,24

Accordingly, this study explores mode of action and therapeutic potential of existing antiviral drugs. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses indicate that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 was mutable and similar to bat coronavirus RaTG13. Successive interactions between RdRp (nsp12 alone or in complex with cofactors nsp7-8) and viral RNA demonstrated that the binding affinity values remained the same, but the sites of interaction of RdRp (highly conserved for homologous sequences from different organisms) were altered in the presence of selected antiviral drugs such as Remdesivir, and Sofosbuvir. The antiviral drug Sofosbuvir reduced the number of hydrogen bonds formed between RdRp and RNA. Remdesivir bound more tightly to viral RNA than viral RdRp alone or the nsp12-7-8 hexadecameric complex, resulting in a significant number of hydrogen bonds being formed in the uracil-rich region. The interaction between nsp12-7-8 complex and RNA was mediated by specific interaction sites of nsp7-8. Therefore, the conserved nature of RdRp interaction sites, and alterations due to drug intervention indicate the therapeutic potential of the selected drugs. In this article, we provide additional focus on the interacting amino acids of the nsp7-8 complex and highlight crucial regions that could be targeted for precluding a correct recognition of subunits involved in the hexadecameric assembly, to rationally design molecules endowed with a significant antiviral profile.","Mondal, Sunil Kanti; Mukhoty, Samyabrata; Kundu, Himangsu; Ghosh, Subhajit; Sen, Madhab Kumar; Das, Suvankar; Brogi, Simone",Comput Biol Med,194,25

METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated this hypothesis in a consecutive cohort of 1200 acute inpatients with COVID-19 at two hospitals with a multi-ethnic catchment population in London (UK). The mean age was 68 ± 17 years (57% male) and 74% of patients had at least one comorbidity. Overall, 415 patients (34.6%) reached the primary endpoint of death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 21 days of symptom onset.

They also reported their access to formal and informal teaching had been limited by COVID-19 restrictions. We aimed to create an accessible teaching programme that met their developmental needs as set out by the Foundation curriculum, as well as their confidence and skill set in dealing with common mental health presentations. Our supplementary aims were to promote psychiatry as a career and to provide supervised teaching opportunities to core trainees.MethodHaving assessed the foundation doctors confidence in dealing with different scenarios, we created a 9 week teaching programme covering common mental health presentations they're likely to encounter during their training. The virtual sessions focus on what assessment and management skills would be expected for a foundation doctor, as well as when and how to access support and refer on. The programme was designed to be trainee led with the teaching being facilitated by core trainees as it was felt that they would best relate to the experiences and developmental needs of foundation doctors. This also provided the CTs with an opportunity to develop their teaching skills, something that has become more difficult during COVID.ResultThrough weekly feedback of the sessions we were able to demonstrate that for 8 of the 9 sessions the foundation doctors rated them as being ‘useful’ or ‘very useful’ and we're currently reviewing the topic and materials for the outlying session.Through self-assessed ratings before and after the programme, we demonstrated significant increases in confidence in dealing with all 9 of the scenarios. All of the foundation doctors indicated that they had found the programme beneficial.ConclusionAs shown in the results, the programme has been well received by the foundation doctors who's confidence in dealing with a range of scenarios has improved. The programme has also been well received by the trust who have asked us to repeat the it for future foundation rotations and by core trainees who were grateful of the development opportunities that this provided. Further developments will include extending the programme for the duration of the placement to enable us to cover an enhanced range of presentations and to consolidate core skills.","Hall, David Lane Thomas Harbinson Alexander",BJPsych Open,194,16

Methods: Sixty-six patients with dry eye disease (DED) and 62 healthy subjects (group 2) using FM were enrolled. Groups were divided into: groups 1A and 2A: < 3 hours of FM wear; groups 1B and 2B: 3 to 6 hours; and groups 1C and 2C: > 6 hours. Patients underwent DEQS questionnaire, break-up time (BUT), Schirmer test I (STI), fluorescein and lissamine staining (FS and LS), IVCM to determine corneal dendritic cell density (DCD) and goblet cell density (GCD), and IC to measure HLA-DR, at baseline and after 3 months. Results: FM use duration before enrollment was 27 ± 2.3 and 30 ± 4.1 (days ± SD) for groups 1 and 2 (P > 0.05). After 3 months, DEQS worsened in groups 1B and 1C, STI in groups 1A to 1C, FS and LS in group 1C (P < 0.05); in controls, BUT and FS worsened only in group 2C (P < 0.05). DCD significantly increased in groups 1A to 1C and HLA-DR in groups 1B and 1C (P < 0.05), whereas GCD did not significantly change. DCD and HLA-DR increased only in group 2C (P < 0.05). DEQS significantly correlated with DCD (P = 0.05, r = 0.698; P < 0.001, r = 0.832) and HLA-DR (P = 0.043, r = -0.687; P < 0.001, r = 0.861) at baseline and 3 months. Conclusions: Use of FM increases ocular surface inflammation and negatively impacts the quality of life in patients with DED.

We have performed comprehensive literature search from the popular databases such as PubMed Google scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus. Finally, we have illustrated the structural landscape of different significant viral proteins (3 CLpro or Mpro, PLpro, RdRp, helicase, S protein) and host proteins as drug targets (cathepsin L, furin, TMPRSS2, ACE2). Expert opinion: The structural landscape of PDT with their binding pockets, and significant residues involved in binding has been discussed further to better understand the PDT and the structure-based drug discovery for SARS-CoV-2.

Several recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 indicate the high risk of transmission among passengers on public buses if special precautions are not taken. This study presents a combined experimental and numerical analysis to identify transmission mechanisms on an urban bus and assess strategies to reduce risk. The effects of the ventilation and air-conditioning systems, opening windows and doors, and wearing masks are analyzed. Specific attention is made to the transport of sub-micron and micron-size particles relevant to typical respiratory droplets. High-resolution instrumentation was used to measure size distribution and aerosol response time on a University of Michigan campus bus under these different conditions. Computational fluid dynamics was employed to measure the airflow within the bus and evaluate risk. A risk metric was adopted based on the number of particles exposed to susceptible passengers. The flow that carries these aerosols is predominantly controlled by the ventilation system, which acts to uniformly distribute the aerosol concentration throughout the bus while simultaneously diluting it with fresh air. The opening of doors and windows was found to reduce the concentration by approximately one half, albeit its benefit does not uniformly impact all passengers on the bus due to recirculation of airflow caused by entrainment through windows. Finally, it was found that well fitted surgical masks, when worn by both infected and susceptible passengers, can nearly eliminate the transmission of the disease.","Zhang, Zhihang; Han, Taehoon; Yoo, Kwang Hee; Capecelatro, Jesse; Boehman, Andre; Maki, Kevin",,194,16

Identification of potentially modifiable determinants of social distancing behavior may provide essential evidence to inform social distancing behavioral interventions. PURPOSE: The current study applied an integrated social cognition model to identify the determinants of social distancing behavior, and the processes involved, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In a prospective correlational survey study, samples of Australian (N = 365) and U.S. (N = 440) residents completed online self-report measures of social cognition constructs (attitude, subjective norm, moral norm, anticipated regret, and perceived behavioral control [PBC]), intention, action planning, habit, and past behavior with respect to social distancing behavior at an initial occasion. Follow-up measures of habit and social distancing behavior were taken 1 week later. RESULTS: Structural equation models indicated that subjective norm, moral norm, and PBC were consistent predictors of intention in both samples. Intention, action planning, and habit at follow-up were consistent predictors of social distancing behavior in both samples. Action planning did not have consistent effects mediating or moderating the intention-behavior relationship. Inclusion of past behavior in the model attenuated effects among constructs, although the effects of the determinants of intention and behavior remained. CONCLUSIONS: Current findings highlight the importance of subjective norm, moral obligation, and PBC as determinants of social distancing intention and intention and habit as behavioral determinants. Future research on long-range predictors of social distancing behavior and reciprocal effects in the integrated model is warranted.","Hagger, Martin S; Smith, Stephanie R; Keech, Jacob J; Moyers, Susette A; Hamilton, Kyra",Ann Behav Med,194,25

However, very little is currently known about neonatal COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Thus, many questions arise with regard to respiratory care after birth, necessary protection to health care workers (HCW) in the delivery room and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and safety of bag and mask ventilation, noninvasive respiratory support, deep suctioning, endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Indeed, these questions have created tremendous confusion amongst neonatal HCW. In this manuscript, we comprehensively reviewed the current evidence regarding COVID-19 perinatal transmission, respiratory outcomes of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 and infants with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the evidence for using different respiratory support modalities and aerosol-generating procedures in this specific population. The results demonstrated that to date, neonatal COVID-19 infection is uncommon, generally acquired postnatally, and associated with favorable respiratory outcomes. The reason why infants display a milder spectrum of disease remains unclear. Nonetheless, the risk of severe or critical illness in young patients exists. Currently, the recommended respiratory approach for infants with suspected or confirmed infection is not evidence based but should include all routinely used types of support, with the addition of viral filters, proper personal protective equipment, and placement of infants in isolation rooms, ideally with negative pressure. As information is changing rapidly, clinicians should frequently watch out for updates on the subject.

The aim of this work was to identify if there had been a rise of childhood suicide during the COVID pandemic; using data from Englands National Child Mortality Database (NCMD). MethodChild suicide rates between April to December 2020 were compared with those in 2019 using negative binomial regression models, and characteristics compared. In a subset (1st January to 17th May 2020) further characteristics and possible contributing factors were obtained. ResultsA total of 193 likely childhood deaths by suicide were reported. There was no evidence overall suicide deaths were higher in 2020 than 2019 (RR 1.09 (0.80-1.48), p=0.584) but weak evidence that the rate in the first lockdown period (April to May 2020) was higher than the corresponding period in 2019 (RR 1.56 (0.86-2.81), p=0.144). Characteristics of individuals were similar between periods. Restriction to education and other activities, disruption to care and support services, tensions at home and isolation appeared to be contributing factors. LimitationsAs child suicides are fortunately rare, the analysis is based on small numbers of deaths with limited statistical power to detect anything but major increases in incidence. ConclusionWe found no consistent evidence that child suicide deaths increased during the COVID-19 pandemic although there was a concerning signal they may have increased during the first UK lockdown. A similar peak was not seen during the following months, or the second lockdown.","Odd, David E; Williams, Tom; Appleby, Louis; Gunnell, David; Luyt, Karen",,194,24

The definite pathogenesis and immunological influences of SARS-CoV-2 have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we constructed a brief summary comparison of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections regarding their immunological changes. In addition, we further investigated the immunological differences between severe and nonsevere COVID-19 cases, and we searched for possible immunological predictors of the patient outcome by reviewing case series studies to date. Possible immunological predictors of a poor outcome are leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia (both CD4 and CD8 T cells), an increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-&#945;), Th1 cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-Î³), regulatory T cell cytokines (IL-10) and Th17 cytokines (IL-17).

Reported hospital and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission rates are as high as 88% and 80% respectively. Cardiovascular involvement including shock, ventricular systolic dysfunction or coronary artery (CA) anomalies has been reported as a feature of MIS-C. Our objective is to describe the cardiovascular features of children with severe MIS-C during their admission PICU admission and up to 3-months follow-up. METHODS: single center observational retrospective study. RESULTS: seven children (1/7 female, median age of 10.6 years and range 4.8-13.8) were admitted between April 16th and May 5th 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis was made by respiratory reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or serological tests. All children had shock that was treated with intravenous fluids (median 15 mL/Kg, range 10-30) and norepinephrine infusions (median dose 0.16 mcg/Kg, range 0.05-0.33). Left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 55% was present in 2/7 patients during PICU admission and 4/7 had CA anomalies. 2/7 patients had altered EKGs (diffuse altered repolarization and prolonged PR interval). Troponin-I was elevated in 7/7 (median 107.3 ng/L, range 30-355) as was N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (median 12,033 pg/mL, range 1071-34547). All patients had normal LVEF and CAs at 1, 2 and 3-months follow-up. 1/7 patient had an altered EKG at 1-month follow-up that resolved later. CONCLUSIONS: cardiac involvement in severe MIS-C appears to be common and severe but limited in time and with good outcomes.","Rodríguez-Rubio, M.; Arizcun, B.; Peragón-Hidalgo, I.; Román, C.; Salas-Mera, D.; Santos-Simarro, G.; De La Oliva, P.",Pediatric Critical Care Medicine,194,14

We performed a phase 2 trial to assess the efficacy and safety of human umbilical cord-mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) to treat severe COVID-19 patients with lung damage, based on our phase 1 data. In this randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial, we recruited 101 severe COVID-19 patients with lung damage. They were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to receive either UC-MSCs (4 × 107 cells per infusion) or placebo on day 0, 3, and 6. The primary endpoint was an altered proportion of whole lung lesion volumes from baseline to day 28. Other imaging outcomes, 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), maximum vital capacity, diffusing capacity, and adverse events were recorded and analyzed. In all, 100 COVID-19 patients were finally received either UC-MSCs (n = 65) or placebo (n = 35). UC-MSCs administration exerted numerical improvement in whole lung lesion volume from baseline to day 28 compared with the placebo (the median difference was -13.31%, 95% CI -29.14%, 2.13%, P = 0.080). UC-MSCs significantly reduced the proportions of solid component lesion volume compared with the placebo (median difference: -15.45%; 95% CI -30.82%, -0.39%; P = 0.043). The 6-MWT showed an increased distance in patients treated with UC-MSCs (difference: 27.00 m; 95% CI 0.00, 57.00; P = 0.057). The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. These results suggest that UC-MSCs treatment is a safe and potentially effective therapeutic approach for COVID-19 patients with lung damage. A phase 3 trial is required to evaluate effects on reducing mortality and preventing long-term pulmonary disability. (Funded by The National Key R&D Program of China and others.

Due to its high pathogenicity and infectivity and the lack of effective vaccines and therapeutics, live SARS-CoV-2 has to be handled under biosafety level 3 conditions, which has hindered the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Based on a VSV pseudovirus production system, a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay has been developed for evaluating neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in biosafety level 2 facilities. The key parameters for this assay were optimized, including cell types, cell numbers, virus inoculum. When tested against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patient sera showed high neutralizing potency, which underscore its potential as therapeutics. The limit of detection for this assay was determined as 22.1 and 43.2 for human and mouse serum samples respectively using a panel of 120 negative samples. The cutoff values were set as 30 and 50 for human and mouse serum samples, respectively.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines and examine the factors associated with the acceptance in Bangladesh. Method: In between January 30 to February 6, 2021, we conducted a web-based anonymous cross-sectional survey among the Bangladeshi general population. The multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the factors that influence the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination. Results: 61.16% (370/605) of the respondents were willing to accept/take the COVID-19 vaccine. Among the accepted group, only 35.14% showed the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine immediately, while 64.86% would delay the vaccination until they are confirmed about the vaccine's efficacy and safety or COVID-19 become deadlier in Bangladesh. The regression results showed age, gender, location (urban/rural), level of education, income, perceived risk of being infected with COVID-19 in the future, perceived severity of infection, having previous vaccination experience after age 18, having higher knowledge about COVID-19 and vaccination were significantly associated with the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. Conclusion: The research reported a high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine refusal and hesitancy in Bangladesh. To diminish the vaccine hesitancy and increase the uptake, the policymakers need to design a well-researched immunization strategy to remove the vaccination barriers. To improve vaccine acceptance among people, false rumors and misconceptions about the COVID-19 vaccines must be dispelled (especially on the internet) and people must be exposed to the actual scientific facts.","Mahmud, Sultan; Mohsin, Md.; Khan, Ijaz Ahmed; Mian, Ashraf Uddin; Zaman, Miah Akib",,194,16

Assessment the state of the lungs using CT in the dynamic follow-up of pa-tients who have suffered from viral COVID-19 pneumonia in the delayed period af-ter 6-10 months, and to identify the relationship of residual lung changes with the clinical condition and results of external respiratory function (ERF). Materials and methods. We examined 78 patients who had suffered from bilateral polysegmental viral COVID-19 pneumonia in April-May 2020, using multi-spiral computed tomography (CT) of the lungs. All patients had a medical history, performed CT scans of the lungs in the acute and delayed (6-10 months after hospitalization) phases, and a study of FVD in the delayed phase. The analysis of a series of tomograms of the lungs in dynamics was carried out. We developed an severity score of the lung condition (LungSS), expressed in the total score, which was calculated based on the score of typical patterns characteristic of viral Covid19-pneumonia, as well as residual changes and areas of fibrosis. LungSS was calculated for each patient in the acute and delayed follow-up periods. Results. The present study shows the dynamics of lung changes in the delayed peri-od 6-10 months after the viral Covid19-pneumonia. Residual lung changes were detected in 66 people (84,6%). Of these, 35,9% of patients have areas of fibrosis, but most of the residu-al changes are linear and small-nodular seals (76,9%). The frequency of detection of residual reticular changes and consolidation was low (15,3%, 1,3%, respectively). Attention is drawn to the relatively frequent detection of areas of ""Ground-glass opacity ""(10,8%). In patients with severe and critical course of viral Covid19-pneumonia (CT3 and CT4), LungSS in the delayed follow-up period did not significantly differ from that in patients with mild and mod-erate course (CT1 and CT2) of the disease (4,5 [0,22], 2,5 [0,16], accordingly, p=0,61). There was no significant correlation between the detected residual lung changes in the delayed period and ERF. Conclusion. In a significant part of patients (84,6%) who have suffered from COVID-19 viral pneumonia, residual changes in the lung parenchyma persist, mainly in the form of linear seals and to a lesser extent fibrosis. These changes did not have a reliable relation-ship with the results of the FVD. LungSS proposed in this study reflects the dynamic picture of lung changes in the acute and delayed period, and can be a good indicator for monitoring patients who have suffered from COVID-19 viral pneumonia.","Gaman, S.

The newly created COVID-19 programs include 7 weekly sessions (Community Health Worker [in English and Spanish], Critical Care, Education, First-Responder Resiliency, Infectious Disease Office Hours, and Multi-specialty) and 3 one-day special sessions. We calculated the total number of attendees, along with the range and standard deviation, per session by program.

Valuable information on the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnant patients with an autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), is currently lacking. Methods: Herein, we describe the clinical presentation of 2 pregnant patients with SLE and mild symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Results: In both pregnant SLE patients, a watchful-waiting approach without initiation of treatment for COVID-19 was taken. No adverse outcomes were reported and both pregnancies resulted in healthy neonates born at term. In one patient we observed a flare in SLE disease activity, most likely attributed to discontinuing SLE treatment. Conclusion: Our report highlights the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration between health care professionals as well as individualized treatment decisions during unprecedented periods such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs during the acute phase of a COVID-19 infection should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Maternal treatment decisions should be in line with current recommendations for treatment of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases during COVID-19 infection and in line with treatment of COVID- 19 during pregnancy.","Smeele, Hieronymus Tw; Perez-Garcia, Luis F; Grimminck, Koen; Schoenmakers, Sam; Mulders, Annemarie Gmgj; Dolhain, Radboud Jem",Lupus,194,33

Such data are vital for understanding the pandemics progression on the continent, evaluating containment measures, and policy planning. MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional, nationally representative, age-stratified serosurvey in Sierra Leone in March 2021 by randomly selecting 120 Enumeration Areas throughout the country and 10 randomly selected households in each of these. One to two persons per selected household were interviewed to collect information on socio-demographics, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, exposure history to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, and history of COVID-19 illness. Capillary blood was collected by fingerstick, and blood samples were tested using the Hangzhou Biotest Biotech RightSign COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette. Total seroprevalence was was estimated after applying sampling weights. FindingsThe overall weighted seroprevalence was 2.6% (95% CI 1.9-3.4). This is 43 times higher than the reported number of cases. Rural seropositivity was 1.8% (95% CI 1.0-2.5), and urban seropositivity was 4.2% (95% CI 2.6-5.7). InterpretationAlthough overall seroprevalence was low compared to countries in Europe and the Americas (suggesting relatively successful containment in Sierra Leone), our findings indicate enormous underreporting of active cases. This has ramifications for the countrys third wave (which started in June 2021), where the average number of daily reported cases was 87 by the end of the month--this could potentially be on the order of 3,700 actual infections, calling for stronger containment measures in a country with only 0.2% of people fully vaccinated. It may also reflect significant underreporting of incidence and mortality across the continent.

This study aimed to explore the overall scenario of COVID-19 including spatial distribution of cases; government efforts, and impact on public health, socio-economy, and education during the lockdown in Nepal. We collated and analyzed data using official figures from the Nepalese Ministry of Health and Population. Nepal had performed 7,791 RT-PCR tests for COVID-19, the highest number of tests during the lockdown. It has recorded its highest daily rise in coronavirus infections with a total of 740 new cases from the total of 4,483 RT-PCR tests performed on a single day. Nepal had reported a total of 17,994 positive cases and 40 deaths at the end of lockdown. The spatial distribution clearly shows that the cases were rapidly spreading from the southern part of the country where most points of entry and exit from India are located. To contain the spread of the virus, the government has also initiated various preventive measures and strategies during the lockdown. The Government of Nepal needs to allocate more resources, increase its capacity to test and trace, establish dedicated isolation and quarantine facility and impose local restrictions such as a local lockdown based on risk assessment rather than a nationwide lockdown.","Sharma, Kusum; Banstola, Amrit; Parajuli, Rishi Ram",Front Public Health,194,24

The aim of this study was to determine the etiologies and to analyze the maternal or fetal complications of fever in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective single center study including all patients who consulted for fever above 38 °C during pregnancy in the gynecological emergency ward from August 2016 to July 2017. RESULTS: A total of 100 pregnant women who consulted for fever were included. The etiologies were common viral infections (37 %), influenza (21 %), pyelonephritis (11 %), viral gastroenteritis (6%), chorioamnionitis (5%), other (5%). The etiology was unknown for 15 %. Fever was confirmed during consultation in 45/100 patients (45 %). Among patients with confirmed fever, 21/45 (47 %) were hospitalized with a median stay of 3 days [IQR 2-4] and 10/45(22 %) developed fetal or maternal complications. Probabilistic antibiotics were delivered for 34/45, 76 % patients. Only 14/45, 31 % had confirmed bacterial infections. Of the 32 patients with confirmed fever who had no etiologic diagnosis at the initial work-up in the emergency room, 19/32, 59 % received presumptive treatment with amoxicillin against Listeria monocytogenes. None had confirmed listeriosis, and all were probably common viral infections. Among all patients, the complications rate was 13 % and 22 % in the subgroup with fever confirmed at presentation. CONCLUSIONS: This study quantifies the main etiologies and complications of fever during pregnancy. A challenge is to reduce excessive antibiotic use by improving rapid diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections. Prospective studies are needed to target patients at risk of complications in an optimal way and to study new management strategies.","Egloff, C; Sibiude, J; Couffignal, C; Mandelbrot, L; Picone, O",J Gynecol Obstet Hum Reprod,194,6

Recently, airborne transmission has been postulated to be a major contributor to the spread of the novel coronavirus, especially in enclosed public spaces. While many studies have demonstrated positive correlations between atmospheric pollutants and SARS-CoV-2 infection, the impact of indoor air pollutants on airborne transmission has been largely overlooked. In particular, laser printers are a primary source of particle emission that increases the concentrations of particulate matter in indoor atmosphere by releasing substantial quantities of electrostatic fine particles, at rates comparable with tobacco smoking and incense burning. We hypothesized that particles emitted from laser printers present a potential risk factor for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in offices and other indoor environments with high user occupancy. To test this hypothesis, we reviewed recent knowledge on the characteristics of particles emitted by laser printing, including their emission rates and accumulation in indoor air, electrostatic charges, localized emission and subsequent particle diffusion in relation to the human breathing zone. We then discuss the potential impact on the transmission of SAR-CoV-2 in indoor spaces. We found that emission rates from laser printers ranged from 108 to 1012 particles min-1, and these fine particles typically remain suspended for prolonged periods in indoor air. Electrostatic charges carried by these particles can reach 260-379 e per particle, thus enhancing their surface adsorption and deposition in human airways. Localized emission by laser printers and subsequent diffusion highly increase particle concentrations near the human breathing zone.","He, Shanshan; Han, Jie",Environ Chem Lett,194,26

However, it is unclear how the viruses survive for such a long time and why their survivability varies across different surfaces. To address these questions, we conduct systematic experiments investigating the evaporation of droplets produced by a nebulizer and human-exhaled gas on surfaces. We found that these droplets do not disappear with evaporation, but instead shrink to a size of a few micrometers (referred to as residues), persist for more than 24 hours, and are highly durable against changes of environmental conditions. The characteristics of these residues change significantly across surface types. Specifically, surfaces with high thermal conductivity like copper do not leave any resolvable residues, while stainless steel, plastic, and glass surfaces form residues from a varying fraction of all deposited droplets at 40% relative humidity. Lowering humidity level suppresses the formation of residues while increasing humidity level enhances it. Our results suggest that these microscale residues can potentially insulate the virus against environmental changes, allowing them to survive inhospitable environments and remain infectious for prolonged durations after deposition. Our findings can also be extended to other viruses transmitted through respiratory droplets (e.g., SARS-CoV, flu viruses, etc.), and can thus lead to practical guidelines for disinfecting surfaces and other prevention measures (e.g., humidity control) for limiting viral transmission.","Kumar, S.

The binding of SARS-CoV (CoV) spike protein (S-Protein) Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) to Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor initiates the entry of corona virus into the host cells leading to the infection. However, considering the mutations reported in the SARS-CoV 2 (nCoV), the structural changes and the binding interactions of the S-protein RBD of nCoV were not clear. The present study was designed to elucidate the structural changes, hot spot binding residues and their interactions between the nCoV S-protein RBD and ACE2 receptor through computational approaches. Based on the sequence alignment, a total of 58 residues were found mutated in nCoV S-protein RBD. These mutations led to the structural changes in the nCoV S-protein RBD 3d structure with 4 helices, 10 sheets and intermittent loops. The nCoV RBD was found binding to ACE2 receptor with 11 hydrogen bonds and 1 salt bridge. The major hot spot amino acids involved in the binding identified by interaction analysis after simulations includes Glu 35, Tyr 83, Asp 38, Lys 31, Glu 37, His 34 amino acid residues of ACE2 receptor and Gln 493, Gln 498, Asn 487, Tyr 505 and Lys 417 residues in nCoV S-protein RBD. Based on the hydrogen bonding, RMSD and RMSF, total and potential energies, the nCoV was found binding to ACE2 receptor with higher stability and rigidity.

We problematise the idea of a nexus by undertaking a critical examination of the concept through the lens of educational ideologies to theorise the changes over time that shape the ways teaching and research are practised. Two hundred seven academic staff in the Humanities and Social Sciences were surveyed in 10 universities in England and Wales; the universities were identified as having strength in teaching, research, or in both. Along with analysis of interviews with senior managers at these universities, findings suggest that systemic forces which separate teaching and research are evident in institutional contexts with implications for the idea of a nexus. While the nexus may exist in theory, in practice, we argue that teaching and research can be pulled in different directions by institutional priorities. Furthermore, in institutions which adopt an enterprise ideology, there are signs of a nascent nexus emerging between research and innovation.","McKinley, Jim; McIntosh, Shona; Milligan, Lizzi; Mikołajewska, Agata",High.

Recent guidelines from the AUA/CUA/SUFU and advancements in the field reflect a paradigm shift for clinician and patients, steering away from empiric antibiotic therapy towards judicious antibiotic use. RECENT FINDINGS: Antibiotic stewardship, including increasing awareness of the collateral damage of antibiotics and the risks of bacterial resistance are a major focus of the new guidelines. Accurate diagnosis of rUTIs is imperative. Urine cultures are necessary to document rUTI and should be obtained prior to any treatment. First line treatment options (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin) should be used whenever possible. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated in these patients with rUTI. Although antibiotic prophylaxis methods are effective, nonantibiotic regimens show promise. SUMMARY: The management of rUTIs has evolved significantly with the goal of antibiotic stewardship. It is increasingly important to ensure the accuracy of diagnosis with a positive urine culture in the setting of cystitis symptoms, and standardize treatment with first-line therapies to minimize antibiotic side effects.","Taich, Lior; Zhao, Hanson; Cordero, Camila; Anger, Jennifer T",Curr Opin Urol,194,24

METHODS: Virus was inoculated on a plastic surface and harvested at predefined time-points in parallel at 20°C-25°C (room temperature; RT) and at 28°C (June temperature; JT). Samples were tested by TCID50 titres on Vero cells. RESULTS: Our results confirm that fomite transmission of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 is possible: the virus reserved its ability to infect cells for up to 84 hours at both RT and JT on a plastic surface, with TCID50 viral titres of 0.67 and 0.25 log10, respectively. At RT, an important reduction in the viral titre, from 4 log10 to 3 log10 TCID50, was observed during the first 24-36 hours. At JT, the same decay was observed more rapidly (between 8 and 12 hours), The rate of viral inactivation by D-value was 24.74 hours at RT and 12.21 hours at JT. CONCLUSIONS: This remarkable difference between the two temperatures suggests that virus vitality can be influenced by the environmental temperature and that the hot season could reduce the probability of COVID-19 transmission.","Magurano, Fabio; Baggieri, Melissa; Marchi, Antonella; Rezza, Giovanni; Nicoletti, Loredana",Clin. microbiol. infect,194,16

The secondary objective was to identify risk factors associated with burnout in this population. In a nationwide, cross-sectional survey, a questionnaire was e-mailed to all paediatric residents in France in the first week of May 2020. The prevalence of burnout was assessed with the validated French-language version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory - Human Services Survey. The questionnaire also contained items on the residents' sociodemographic characteristics and professional situation. Three hundred and forty paediatric residents completed the questionnaire. The median age was 27 (interquartile range 25-28) and 285 (83.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) [79.5-87.6]) of the residents were women. The prevalence of burnout was 37.4%, 95%CI [32.2-42.7]. There was no association between burnout and exposure to the consequences of COVID-19, which may be related to the low incidence of severe COVID-19 among children. In contrast, the hours worked per week and the anxiety scores were significantly associated with burnout.Conclusion: The level of burnout among French paediatric residents is a matter of concern for residents, and cannot be ascribed to the COVID-19 outbreak. Preventive actions should be implemented, with a reduction in working hours and support programs to help manage work-related anxiety. What is Known: â¢ Burnout is a concern for both residents and the patients they care for. â¢ Natural disasters disrupt the health care organizations and increase the burnout rate. What is New: â¢ The prevalence of burnout among paediatric residents in France is 37.4%, 95%CI [32.2-42.7]. â¢ COVID-19 outbreak is not associated with burnout in this population but anxiety and working hours per week might be modifiable risk factors.","Treluyer, Ludovic; Tourneux, Pierre",Eur J Pediatr,194,23

Post-extubation stridor is of increasing concern during the COVID-19 pandemic, as risk for re-intubation and consequent poor outcome is high. We present a case of post-extubation stridor due to tracheal mucus plugging in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia. Case Presentation: A 61-year-old female diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, right lower lobe pulmonary embolus, and left lung pneumothorax with chest tube experienced a nontraumatic intubation and 13 days of ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. Four days following extubation patient developed stridor and increased oxygen requirement. Patient was given racemic epinephrine 0.5mL x two doses and IV solumedrol 40mg BID x four doses, maintaining oxygen saturation &gt;91% on BiPAP. Direct visualization under flexible laryngoscopy showed small granulation tissue in posterior commissure and concretions and dried mucus in the trachea. The following day, patient displayed worsening stridor, hoarseness, and respiratory difficulty. Bronchoscopy versus tracheoscopy was considered. CT chest displayed moderate debris within the proximal trachea. Due to concern for airway compromise with bronchoscopy, patient underwent laryngoscopy and tracheoscopy with tracheal plug removal by airway forceps. Stridor and hoarseness improved following procedure;oxygen requirements declined in following two-three days leading to discharge. Discussion: Post-extubation stridor can occur in nearly 10% of intensive care unit patients, frequently due to laryngeal edema. In the present case, our patient underwent steroid and racemic epinephrine therapy to address this possible cause with no clinical improvement. Chest CT was performed for further characterization, which discovered moderate debris within the proximal trachea. We hypothesize the tracheal debris accumulation was due to illness with COVID-19, prolonged intubation, and a weak cough unable to clear airway secretions. Previous studies have shown that COVID-19 pneumonia causes bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid exudates leading to excessive airway mucus. This excess mucus leads to increased airway resistance and decreased alveolar gas exchange. Weakness after critical illness and prolonged intubation likely contributed to our patient's inability to clear these secretions, leading to tracheal accumulation, increased oxygen requirement, and stridor. Bronchoscopy and/or intubation in patients with tracheal debris may be detrimental due to endotracheal tube obstruction or mucus plug mobilization into distal bronchi and subsequent respiratory failure. Therefore, it is important to maintain a broad differential diagnosis while assessing stridor after extubation, particularly in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Palmer, G.; Buus, D.; Kasznica, P.; Jamous, F.

In this single-center study, we describe neurological manifestations of 58 patients, regarding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and neuroimaging findings. METHODS: 58 COVID-19 patients with neurologic manifestations and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR screening on CSF analysis were included. Clinical, laboratory, and brain MRI data were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Patients were mostly men (66%) with a median age of 62 years. Encephalopathy was frequent (81%), followed by a pyramidal dysfunction (16%), seizures (10%), and headaches (5%). Protein and albumin levels in CSF were increased in 38% and 23%, respectively. A total of 40% of patients displayed an elevated albumin quotient suggesting impaired blood-brain barrier integrity. CSF-specific IgG oligoclonal band was found in five (11%) cases, suggesting an intrathecal synthesis of IgG, and 26 (55%) patients presented identical oligoclonal bands in serum and CSF. Four (7%) patients harbored a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in CSF. Regarding brain MRI, 20 (38%) patients presented leptomeningeal enhancement.

Many clinical trials will have more missing data because of a participant's inability to attend in-person visits, discontinuation of trial activities, or interruption of time-sensitive study collection data due to COVID-19. All of these events affect the data quality of trials. Government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and National Institutes of Health (NIH) have issued recommendations for investigators conducting clinical trials to combat the spread of COVID-19 and to maintain data integrity. Institutions sponsoring clinical trials have also provided guidelines to continue, modify, or pause research studies that are essential to ensure participant and research team safety. Key recommendations include implementing telehealth appointments, wearing a protective mask and face shield, quarantining for 14 days if exposed to COVID-19 or having traveled, and, if possible, maintaining a 6-foot distance. It is also recommended that investigators implement COVID-19 screening questionnaires prior to and during on-site visits. This includes participants and research personnel completing a temperature check and questionnaire screen before in-person data collection.

In this paper, we investigate reachable set computation for discrete nonlinear systems based on parallelotope bundles. The algorithm relies on computing an upper bound on the supremum of a nonlinear function over a rectangular domain, which has been traditionally done using Bernstein polynomials. We strive to remove the manual step of parallelotope template selection to make the method fully automatic. Furthermore, we show that changing templates dynamically during computations cans improve accuracy. To this end, we investigate two techniques for generating the template directions. The first technique approximates the dynamics as a linear transformation and generates templates using this linear transformation. The second technique uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of sample trajectories for generating templates. We have implemented our approach in a Python-based tool called Kaa and improve its performance by two main enhancements. The tool is modular and use two types of global optimization solvers, the first using Bernstein polynomials and the second using NASA's Kodiak nonlinear optimization library. Second, we leverage the natural parallelism of the reachability algorithm and parallelize the Kaa implementation. We demonstrate the improved accuracy of our approach on several standard nonlinear benchmark systems.","Kim, Edward; Bak, Stanley; Duggirala, Parasara Sridhar",,194,32

Here, we provide a critical view on selected surface markers, transcriptional and translational pathways commonly used to identify MDSC by specific, their developmental origin and new possibilities by transcriptional or proteomic profiling. Discrimination of MDSC from their non-suppressive counterparts is a prerequisite for the development of successful therapies. Understanding the switch mechanisms that direct granulocytic and monocytic development into a pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory direction will be crucial for therapeutic strategies. Manipulation of these myeloid checkpoints are exploited by tumors and pathogens, such as M. tuberculosis (Mtb), HIV or SARS-CoV-2, that induce MDSC for immune evasion. Thus, specific markers for MDSC identification may reveal also novel molecular candidates for therapeutic intervention at the level of MDSC.","Lutz, Manfred B; Eckert, Ina N",Cell Immunol,194,26

The pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus whose main protease (Mpro) is a promising drug target since it plays a key role in viral proliferation and replication. Currently, developing an effective therapy is an urgent task, which requires accurately estimating the ligand-binding free energy to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. However, it should be noted that the accuracy of a free energy method probably depends on the protein target. A highly accurate approach for some targets may fail to produce a reasonable correlation with the experiment when a novel enzyme is considered as a drug target. Therefore, in this context, the ligand-binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was calculated via various approaches. The molecular docking approach was manipulated using Autodock Vina (Vina) and Autodock4 (AD4) protocols to preliminarily investigate the ligand-binding affinity and pose to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The binding free energy was then refined using the fast pulling of ligand (FPL), linear interaction energy (LIE), molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA), and free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. The benchmark results indicated that for docking calculations, Vina is more accurate than AD4, and for free energy methods, FEP is the most accurate method, followed by LIE, FPL, and MM-PBSA (FEP > LIE &#8776; FPL > MM-PBSA). Moreover, atomistic simulations revealed that the van der Waals interaction is the dominant factor. The residues Thr26, His41, Ser46, Asn142, Gly143, Cys145, His164, Glu166, and Gln189 are essential elements affecting the binding process. Our benchmark provides guidelines for further investigations using computational approaches.","Ngo, Son Tung; Tam, Nguyen Minh; Pham, Minh Quan; Nguyen, Trung Hai",J Chem Inf Model,194,1

It appears that lipid‐lowering pharmacological interventions, in particular statins, might reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications caused by COVID‐19 and might potentially have an additional antiviral activity. It has been shown that high cholesterol levels are associated with more lipid rafts, subdomains of the plasma membrane that can harbour angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors for the S‐protein of SARS‐CoV‐2. Evidence of the importance of cholesterol for viral entry into host cells could suggest a role for cholesterol‐lowering therapies in reducing viral infectivity. In addition to their lipid‐lowering and plaque‐stabilisation effects, statins possess pleiotropic effects including anti‐inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antithrombotic activities. Lower rates of mortality and intubation have been reported in studies investigating statin therapy in influenza infection, and statin therapy was shown to increase viral clearance from the blood during chronic hepatitis C infection. Statins may also serve as potential SARS‐CoV‐2 main protease inhibitors, thereby contributing to the control of viral infection. In this review, we elaborate on the role of cholesterol level in the process of the coronavirus infection and provide a critical appraisal on the potential of statins in reducing the severity, duration, and complications of COVID‐19.","Radenkovic, Dina; Chawla, Shreya; Pirro, Matteo; Sahebkar, Amirhossein; Banach, Maciej",J.

Developing rapid and sensitive diagnostic tools is key for successful patient management and curbing disease spread. Currently available diagnostics are very specific and sensitive but time-consuming and require expensive laboratory settings and well-trained personnel; thus, they are not available in resource-limited areas, for the purposes of large-scale screenings and in case of outbreaks and epidemics. Developing new, rapid, and affordable point-of-care diagnostic assays is urgently needed. This review focuses on CRISPR-based technologies and their perspectives to become platforms for point-of-care nucleic acid detection methods and as deployable diagnostic platforms that could help to identify and curb outbreaks and emerging epidemics. We describe the mechanisms and function of different classes and types of CRISPR-Cas systems, including pros and cons for developing molecular diagnostic tests and applications of each type to detect a wide range of infectious agents. Many Cas proteins (Cas3, Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, Cas14 etc.) have been leveraged to create highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic tools combined with technologies of signal amplification and fluorescent, potentiometric, colorimetric, lateral flow assay detection and other. In particular, the most advanced platforms -- SHERLOCK/v2, DETECTR, CARMEN or CRISPR-Chip -- enable detection of attomolar amounts of pathogenic nucleic acids with specificity comparable to that of PCR but with minimal technical settings. Further developing CRISPR-based diagnostic tools promises to dramatically transform molecular diagnostics, making them easily affordable and accessible virtually anywhere in the world. The burden of socially significant diseases, frequent outbreaks, recent epidemics (MERS, SARS and the ongoing COVID-19) and outbreaks of zoonotic viruses (African Swine Fever Virus etc.) urgently need the developing and distribution of express-diagnostic tools. Recently devised CRISPR-technologies represent the unprecedented opportunity to reshape epidemiological surveillance and molecular diagnostics.","Kostyusheva, Anastasiya; Brezgin, Sergey; Babin, Yurii; Vasilyeva, Irina; Glebe, Dieter; Kostyushev, Dmitry; Chulanov, Vladimir",Methods (S.

As the search for effective antiviral agents continues, we aimed to review data on the potential of repurposing antiparasitic drugs against viruses in general, with an emphasis on coronaviruses. METHODS: We performed a review by screening in vitro and in vivo studies that assessed the antiviral activity of several antiparasitic agents: chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), mefloquine, artemisinins, ivermectin, nitazoxanide (NTZ), niclosamide, atovaquone and albendazole. RESULTS: For HCQ and chloroquine we found ample in vitro evidence of antiviral activity. Cohort studies that assessed the use of HCQ for COVID-19 reported conflicting results, but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated no effect on mortality rates and no substantial clinical benefits of HCQ used either for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. We found two clinical studies of artemisinins and two studies of NTZ for treatment of viruses other than COVID-19, all of which showed mixed results. Ivermectin was evaluated in one RCT and few observational studies, demonstrating conflicting results. As the level of evidence of these data is low, the efficacy of ivermectin against COVID-19 remains to be proven. For chloroquine, HCQ, mefloquine, artemisinins, ivermectin, NTZ and niclosamide, we found in vitro studies showing some effects against a wide array of viruses. We found no relevant studies for atovaquone and albendazole. CONCLUSIONS: As the search for an effective drug active against SARS-CoV-2 continues, we argue that pre-clinical research of possible antiviral effects of compounds that could have antiviral activity should be conducted. Clinical studies should be conducted when sufficient in vitro evidence exists, and drugs should be introduced into widespread clinical use only after being rigorously tested in RCTs. Such a search may prove beneficial in this pandemic or in outbreaks yet to come.","Rakedzon, S; Neuberger, A; Domb, A J; Petersiel, N; Schwartz, E",J. travel med,194,33

The present study investigated the relationship between the patient characteristics at the initial hospital administration and fatality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective and comparative cohort study, all the 767 hospitalised COVID-19 patients, treated between 18 March and 15 May 2020 in the Covid Clinics of Gulhane Training and Research Hospital in Ankara, Turkey, were evaluated. RESULTS: The fatality rate was significantly increased in patients with any comorbid disease except asthma. The initial laboratory test results indicated highly significant differences according to the patient's outcome. A multifactor logistic regression analysis was performed to calculate the adjusted odds ratios for predicting patient outcomes. Being older than 60 years increased the death risk with an adjusted OR of 7.2 (95% CI: 2.23-23.51; P = .001). The presence of a cancer and the extended duration of intensive care unit treatment were other significant risk factors for nonsurvival. Azithromycin treatment was determined as significantly reduced the death ratio in these patients (P = .002).

The first project focused on standardization of administered activities in pediatric nuclear medicine and resulted in two manuscripts. For its second project the NMGI chose to explore issues impacting on access and availability of radiopharmaceuticals around the world. Methods: Information was obtained by survey responses from 35 countries on available radioisotopes, radiopharmaceuticals and kits for diagnostic and therapeutic use. Issues impacting on access and availability of radiopharmaceuticals in individual countries were also identified. Results: Detailed information on radiopharmaceuticals utilized in each country, and sources of supply, was evaluated. Responses highlighted problems in access particularly due to the reliance on a sole provider, regulatory issues and reimbursement, as well as issues of facilities and workforce particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Conclusion: Strategies to address access and availability of radiopharmaceuticals are outlined, to enable timely and equitable patient access to nuclear medicine procedures worldwide. In the face of disruptions to global supply chains by the COVID-19 outbreak, renewed focus on ensuring reliable supply of radiopharmaceuticals is a major priority for nuclear medicine practice globally.","Cutler, Cathy S; Bailey, Elizabeth A; Kumar, Vijay; Schwarz, Sally W; Bom, Henry Hee-Seung; Hatazawa, Jun; Paez, Diana; Orellana, Pilar; Louw, Lizette; Mut, Fernando; Kato, Hiroki; Chiti, Arturo; Frangos, Savvas; Fahey, Frederic H; Dillehay, Gary; Oh, Seoung Jun; Lee, Dong Soo; Lee, Sze Ting; Nunez-Miller, Rodolfo; Bandopadhyaya, Guru Pad; Pradhan, Prasanta; Scott, Andrew M",J. nucl. med,194,16

The authors present findings from a regional evaluation in the city of Los Angeles (California, USA) with broad application to other areas and demonstrate an approach for isolating and analyzing residential loads from community-level electric utility feeder data. The study addresses effects on residential energy use and the implications for future energy use models, energy planning, and device energy standards and utility program development. In this study we review changes in residential energy use during the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic from four residential communities across Los Angeles covering approximately 6603 households within two microclimate sub regional areas (Los Angeles Basin and San Fernando Valley). Analyses address both absolute and seasonal temperature-corrected energy use changes while assessing estimated changes on energy usage from both temperature-sensitive loads (e.g., air conditioning and electric heating) and non-temperature-sensitive loads (e.g., consumer electronics and major appliance use). An average 5.1% increase in total residential energy use was observed for non-temperature sensitive loads during the pandemic period compared to a 2018–2019 baseline. During mid-spring when shelter in place activity was highest a peak monthly energy use of 20.9% increase was seen compared to a 2018–2019 composite baseline. Considering an average of the top five warmest summer days, a 9.5% increase in energy use was observed for events during summer 2020 compared to summer 2018 (a year with similar magnitude summer high heat events). Based on these results, a potential trend is identified for increased residential load during pandemics and other shelter-in-place disruptions, net of any temperature-sensitive load shifts with greater impacts expected for lower-income communities.","Klopfer, Michael J.; Pixley, Joy E.; Saiyan, Armen Tabakh Amir Jacot David Li Guann-Pyng",Applied Sciences,194,16

Most COVID-19 infections are associated with lower respiratory abnormalities but it has been increasingly associated with extra-pulmonary manifestations. Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a rarely diagnosed but severe disease associated with COVID-19 infection. We describe the diagnostic process behind diagnosing GBS in an elderly male who developed acute-onset quadriparesis and respiratory muscle failure associated with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in a military ICU. A 69-year-old male was admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia. He was subsequently intubated and treated with dexamethasone and remdesivir with improvement. On hospital day 32, the patient was extubated. Three days later, he developed acute, symmetric limb quadriparesis and respiratory muscle failure requiring reintubation. Analysis of his cerebrospinal fluid showed a cytoalbuminologic dissociation, and electromyography/nerve conduction study showed slowed nerve conduction velocity. These findings are consistent with GBS. Blood cultures, serum polymerase chain reaction testing, and clinical symptoms were not suggestive of other common pathogens causing his GBS. The patient's acute GBS in the setting of recent severe COVID-19 infection strongly suggests association between the two entities, as supported by a growing body of case literature. The patient was subjected to intravenous immunoglobulin treatment and was discharged with greatly improved strength in the upper and lower extremities. Our goal in describing this case is to highlight the need for providers to consider, accurately diagnose, and treat GBS as a consequence of severe COVID-19 infection.","Yiu, Alvin C; Hussain, Ali; Okonkwo, Uzoagu A; Villacorta-Lyew, Rachel; McMahon, Michael J; Blattner, Matthew",Mil. med,194,20

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of recently-developed reduced-toxicity myeloablative regimen that combines fludarabine, intravenous busulfan, and melphalan (FBM). METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of 39 patients (23 with myeloid neoplasms and 16 with lymphoid neoplasms), with a median age of 50 (range, 17-68) years, who underwent their first allo-HCT using the FBM regimen. Graft types were bone marrow in 11, peripheral blood in 11, and cord blood in 17 patients. Cyclosporine- or tacrolimus-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was administered. The primary end point of the study was the overall survival rate at 2-year after transplantation. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 910 days for the surviving patients, 2-year overall survival was 62% for the entire cohort; 73% in the low-to-intermediate-risk group and 44% in the high-to-very high-risk group classified by the refined CIBMTR Disease Risk Index. Cumulative incidences of engraftment, grade II-IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, relapse, and non-relapse mortality were 95%, 56%, 56%, 31%, and 17%, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that our FBM regimen can be applied to allo-HCT using various graft types and yields acceptable outcomes with relatively low non-relapse mortality in both myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms. Also, we observed a promising survival in the group of patients with high-risk diseases, warranting more accumulation of patients and longer follow-up.","Edahiro, Taro; Kawase, Takakazu; Nagoshi, Hisao; Fujino, Keita; Toishigawa, Kayo; Miyama, Takahiko; Mino, Tatsuji; Yoshida, Tetsumi; Morioka, Takehiko; Hirata, Yuji; Noma, Mitsunori; Fujii, Teruhisa; Nishizawa, Masatoshi; Fukushima, Noriyasu; Ichinohe, Tatsuo",Hematology,194,22

Opinion dynamics theory is a young interdisciplinary science that studies opinion formation in social networks and has a huge potential in applications, such as marketing, advertisement and recommendations. The term social influence refers to the behavioral change of individuals due to the interactions with others in a social system, e.g. organization, community, or society in general. The advent of the Internet has made a huge volume of data easily available that can be used to measure social influence over large populations. Here, we aim at qualitatively and quantitatively infer social influence from data using a systems and control viewpoint. First, we introduce some definitions and models of opinions dynamics and review some structural constraints of online social networks, based on the notion of sparsity. Then, we review the main approaches to infer the network's structure from a set of observed data. Finally, we present some algorithms that exploit the introduced models and structural constraints, focusing on the sample complexity and computational requirements.","Ravazzi, Chiara; Dabbene, Fabrizio; Lagoa, Constantino; Proskurnikov, Anton V.",,194,0

Starting from March 2020, we included 45 adult patients presenting with signs of respiratory infection (cough and/or fever) to the Emergency Department in this ongoing study. ADM expression was significantly elevated in patients with COVID-19 than other respiratory infections despite similar clinical features at admission. In patients with COVID-19, ADM expression was significantly higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in patients with less severe COVID-19. Further, ADM expression was not significantly different between patients with less severe COVID-19 and patients with other respiratory infections than COVID-19. According to ROC-analysis, ADM was able to differentiate severe from non-severe COVID-19 cases with an AUC of 0.82. Our findings suggest a potential role for ADM in severe COVID-19. While ADM might be a therapeutic target in sepsis and septic shock, further research is needed regarding ADM in COVID-19. Further, the diagnostic potential of ADM as a marker for progression to severe COVID-19 at first medical contact should be evaluated.","Hupf, J.; Mustroph, J.; Hanses, F.; Evert, K.; Maier, L.

Information and awareness on preventative techniques can be spread through the use of social media, which has become an increasingly utilized tool in recent years. This study developed a dynamic transmission model to investigate the impact of social media, particularly tweets via the social networking platform, Twitter on the number of influenza and COVID-19 cases of infection and deaths. We modified the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR-V) model with an additional social media component, in order to increase the accuracy of transmission dynamics and gain insight on whether social media is a beneficial behavioral intervention for these infectious diseases. The analysis found that social media has a positive effect in mitigating the spread of contagious disease in terms of peak time, peak magnitude, total infected, and total death; and the results also showed that social media's effect has a non-linear relationship with the reproduction number R 0 and it will be amplified when a vaccine is available. The findings indicate that social media is an integral part in the humanitarian logistics of pandemic and emergency preparedness, and contributes to the literature by informing best practices in the response to similar disasters.","Kumar, Sameer; Xu, Chong; Ghildayal, Nidhi; Chandra, Charu; Yang, Muer",Ann Oper Res,194,1

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes including mortality and viral shedding period in COVID-19 patients with cancer in Japan. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 32 patients with a history of cancer who were referred to our hospital between January 31, 2020 and May 25, 2020. We evaluated the association between clinical outcomes and potential prognostic factors using univariate analyses. RESULTS: The median age was 74.5 (range 24-90) years and 22 patients (69%) were men. A total of 11 patients (34%) died. Our analyses demonstrated that the mortality was significantly associated with lymphocyte count, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein on admission. The median period between illness onset and the first effective negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR result was 22 days (interquartile range 18-25) in survivors. Of four patients with hematological malignancy who developed COVID-19 within the rest period of chemotherapy, three died and the other patient, who received bendamustine plus rituximab therapy, had the longest duration of viral shedding (56 days). CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that the risk factors for mortality previously reported in general COVID-19 patients, including lymphocytopenia, were also effective in cancer patients. Patients who received cytotoxic chemotherapy recently or were treated with chemotherapy, which can lead to lymphocyte reduction, had poor prognosis and prolonged periods of viral shedding.","Nakamura, Shohei; Kanemasa, Yusuke; Atsuta, Yuya; Fujiwara, Sho; Tanaka, Masaru; Fukushima, Kazuaki; Kobayashi, Taiichiro; Shimoyama, Tatsu; Omuro, Yasushi; Sekiya, Noritaka; Imamura, Akifumi",Int. j. clin. oncol,194,1

We included participants aged 18 and over from LAC surveyed, January 15 to February 1, 2021. We evaluated VI, FAE, sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 symptomatology, compliance with community mitigation strategies, food and economic insecurity, mental health evaluation and the influence in VI when recommended by different stakeholders. We calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios with their 95%CIs. RESULTS: We analyzed 472,521 responses by Latin American adults, finding a VI and FAE prevalence of 80.0% and 81.2%, respectively. We found that female and non-binary genders were associated with a lower probability of VI and a higher probability of FAE. Besides, living in a town, village or rural area and economic insecurity was associated with a higher FAE probability. The fears of becoming seriously ill, a family member becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and having depressive symptoms were associated with a higher probability of VI and FAE. CONCLUSION: Eight out of 10 adults in LAC have VI and FAE. The factors identified are useful for the development of communication strategies to reduce FAE frequency.

Interest in delivering TNP directly to patients' homes has arisen in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, prior research has typically involved patients tested in clinical settings, and the validity of in-home TNP testing has not yet been established. The present study aims to explore the validity and clinical utility of in-home TNP testing in a mixed clinical sample in the wake of COVID-19. METHODS: Test profiles for 111 in-home TNP patients were retrospectively compared with 120 patients who completed in-person evaluations. The TNP test battery consisted of tests measuring attention/processing speed, verbal memory, naming, verbal fluency, and visuoconstruction. TNP scores of cognitively normal (CN) patients were compared with patients with neurocognitive disorders (NCD), and score profiles were examined among suspected diagnostic groups of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and vascular disease (VaD). RESULTS: TNP test scores did not significantly differ from in-person testing across all tests except the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised Discrimination Index. Within the TNP group, significant differences between the CN and NCD groups were found for all tests, and the memory and semantic fluency tests yielded large effect sizes (d &#8805; 0.8). Score profiles among the AD, PD, and VaD groups were explored. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the validity of in-home TNP testing compared with in-person neuropsychological testing. Practice considerations, limitations, and future directions are discussed.","Parks, Adam C; Davis, Jensen; Spresser, Carrie D; Stroescu, Ioan; Ecklund-Johnson, Eric",Arch. clin. neuropsychol,194,1

METHODS: A prospective non-randomized open-label study was undertaken from May to August 2020 on 75 subjects (aged 18-70 years) hospitalized in Siloam Kelapa Dua Hospital. Uni- and multi-variable Cox regression analyses were performed to obtain hazard ratios (HRs). The primary outcomes were: (1) length of hospital stay; (2) time to negative swab; and (3) radiological outcome (time to improvement on chest X ray). RESULTS: None of the 75 patients with COVID-19 required intensive care. All patients were angiotensin-receptor-blocker naïve. In comparison with the control group, the candesartan group had a significantly shorter hospital stay [adjusted HR 2.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-5.29] after adjusting for a wide range of confounders, and no increased risk of intensive care.

The research project Online Dermatologist-AppDoc enables a fast anonymous expert opinion and was approved on 22 October 2018 by the Landesärztekammer Baden-Württemberg for 2 years as a model project. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present work is the presentation of the first real healthcare data for German teledematology within the framework of the external quality assurance of the model project Online Dermatologist-AppDoc. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anonymous data records submitted to Online Dermatologist-AppDoc between 21 November 2018 and 1 August 2019 were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively at the Department of Dermatology of the University Hospital Essen. In addition to the evaluation of the data records submitted so far, 100 cases submitted underwent a second assessment by a board-certified dermatologist to assess concordance. RESULTS: A total of 1364 cases (60.4% men, 39.6% women) were included in the current first external scientific evaluation. In 90.3% of the cases, remote diagnosis was possible. The two most frequent diagnoses were different forms of eczema (nâ¯= 270) and nevi (nâ¯= 163). Almost two thirds of the patients (64.3%) could be treated teledermatologically only.

METHODS: Google Trends (trends.google.com) was utilized to assess public interest in multiple cancer types. We then constructed a forecasting model to determine the expected search interest had the pandemic not occurred. We then compared our models to actual screening usage during the pandemic. RESULTS: Public interest in cancer screenings decreased precipitously at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the Google Trends estimated the decrease in mammogram usage 25.8% below the actual value. Similarly, Google Trends estimated the decrease in colon cancer screening usage 9.7% below the true value. DISCUSSION: We found the decrease in public interest in breast and colon cancer screenings slightly underestimated the actual screening usage numbers, suggesting Google Trends may be utilized as an indicator for human behavior regarding cancer screening, particularly with colon and breast cancer screenings. If the negative trend in cancer screening continues and missed screenings are not appropriately corrected for, socioeconomic and racial disparities in cancer diagnoses, morbidity, and mortality will widen.","Greiner, Benjamin; Tipton, Shelby; Nelson, Blessie; Hartwell, Micah",Curr Probl Cancer,194,24

However, the fundamental dose-response relation is still missing for better evaluating and controlling the infection risk. METHODS: We developed a simple framework to integrate the a priori dose-response relation for SARS-CoV based on mice experiments, the recent data on infection risk from a meta-analysis and the respiratory virus shedding in exhaled breath, to shed light on the dose-response relation for human. The aerosol transmission infection risk was evaluated based on the dose-response model for typical indoor environment. RESULTS: The developed dose-response relation is an exponential function with a constant k in the range of about 6.4×10 4 to 9.8×10 5 virus copies, which means that the infection risk caused by one virus copy in viral shedding is on the order of 10 -6 to 10 -5. The median infection risk via aerosol transmission with one-hour exposure (10 -6 to 10 -4) was significantly lower than the risk caused by close contact (10 -1) in a room of the area from 10 to 400 m 2 with one infected individual in it and with typical ventilation rate 1 ACH (Air Changes per Hour). CONCLUSIONS: The infection risk caused by aerosol transmission was significantly lower than the risk caused by close contact.

Health literacy (HL) and eHealth literacy (as measured by the eHealth Literacy Scale [eHEALS]) are recognized as strategic public health elements but they have been underestimated during the pandemic. HL, eHEALS score, practices, lifestyles, and the health status of health care workers (HCWs) play crucial roles in containing the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the eHEALS and examine associations of HL and eHEALS scores with adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures, lifestyle changes, and suspected COVID-19 symptoms among HCWs during lockdown. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of 5209 HCWs from 15 hospitals and health centers across Vietnam from April 6 to April 19, 2020. Participants answered questions related to sociodemographics, HL, eHEALS, adherence to IPC procedures, behavior changes in eating, smoking, drinking, and physical activity, and suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Principal component analysis, correlation analysis, and bivariate and multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used to validate the eHEALS and examine associations. RESULTS: The eHEALS had a satisfactory construct validity with 8 items highly loaded on one component, with factor loadings ranked from 0.78 to 0.92 explaining 76.34% of variance; satisfactory criterion validity as correlated with HL (&#961;=0.42); satisfactory convergent validity with high item-scale correlations (&#961;=0.80-0.84); and high internal consistency (Cronbach &#945;=.95). HL and eHEALS scores were significantly higher in men (unstandardized coefficient [B]=1.01, 95% CI 0.57-1.45, P<.001; B=0.72, 95% CI 0.43-1.00, P<.001), those with a better ability to pay for medication (B=1.65, 95% CI 1.25-2.05, P<.001; B=0.60, 95% CI 0.34-0.86, P<.001), doctors (B=1.29, 95% CI 0.73-1.84, P<.001; B 0.56, 95% CI 0.20-0.93, P=.003), and those with epidemic containment experience (B=1.96, 95% CI 1.56-2.37, P<.001; B=0.64, 95% CI 0.38-0.91, P<.001), as compared to their counterparts, respectively. HCWs with higher HL or eHEALS scores had better adherence to IPC procedures (B=0.13, 95% CI 0.10-0.15, P<.001; B=0.22, 95% CI 0.19-0.26, P<.001), had a higher likelihood of healthy eating (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.06, P=.001; OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.07, P=.002), were more physically active (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.03, P<.001; OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.05, P<.001), and had a lower likelihood of suspected COVID-19 symptoms (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.98, P<.001; OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.95-0.98, P<.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The eHEALS is a valid and reliable survey tool. Gender, ability to pay for medication, profession, and epidemic containment experience were independent predictors of HL and eHEALS scores. HCWs with higher HL or eHEALS scores had better adherence to IPC procedures, healthier lifestyles, and a lower likelihood of suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Efforts to improve HCWs' HL and eHEALS scores can help to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and minimize its consequences.","Do, Binh N; Tran, Tien V; Phan, Dung T; Nguyen, Hoang C; Nguyen, Thao T P; Nguyen, Huu C; Ha, Tung H; Dao, Hung K; Trinh, Manh V; Do, Thinh V; Nguyen, Hung Q; Vo, Tam T; Nguyen, Nhan P T; Tran, Cuong Q; Tran, Khanh V; Duong, Trang T; Pham, Hai X; Nguyen, Lam V; Nguyen, Kien T; Chang, Peter W S; Duong, Tuyen Van",J Med Internet Res,194,16

The aim of our mixed method study was to assess (a) how effective are virtual clinics vs face-to-face clinics in progressing patients' care and (b) what is patient satisfaction with virtual consultation methods. METHODS: Analysis of clinic data from patient databases for both virtual and face-to-face clinics was carried out. A patient satisfaction survey was carried out by 75 of the patients who had attended virtual clinics. RESULTS: There was statistically a significant difference (p value < 0.01) in the proportion of patients prescribed medical therapy, referred for Speech and Language Therapy (SALT) or listed for surgery in the virtual clinic by comparison to the face-to-face clinic. 75 patients completed the questionnaire. 98% of patients were satisfied overall with the virtual method of consultation. 84% believed they would still benefit from face-to-face review. 83% would like the option of a virtual type of clinic in the future. CONCLUSION: Our data clearly demonstrates that face-to-face clinics are superior to virtual clinics, with almost no patients progressed to surgery in virtual consultations. Despite this, virtual methods are still valuable, and many patients have meaningful progression of care. In current circumstances, patients have very high satisfaction with virtual consultations and certain groups have been identified as particularly benefiting. Going forward, an ideal clinic may be a hybrid of face-to-face and virtual appointments as clinically indicated.","Watters, Carolina; Miller, Benjamin; Kelly, Mairead; Burnay, Victoria; Karagama, Yakubu; Chevretton, Elfy",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,194,20

We propose a physical explanation for this sensitivity, using a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model, where the parameters are stochastically perturbed to simulate the difficulty in detecting patients, different confinement measures taken by different countries, as well as changes in the virus characteristics. Our results suggest that there are physical and statistical reasons to assign low confidence to statistical and dynamical fits, despite their apparently good statistical scores.

By now, it is clear that the number of people infected is much greater than the number of reported cases. To estimate the infected but undetected/unreported cases using a mathematical model, we can use a parameter called the probability of quarantining an infected individual. This parameter exists in the time-delayed SEIQR model (Scientific Reports, article number: 3505). Here, two limiting cases of a network of such models are used to estimate the undetected population. The first limit corresponds to the network collapsing onto a single node and is referred to as the mean-[Formula: see text] model. In the second case, the number of nodes in the network is infinite and results in a continuum model wherein the infectivity is statistically distributed. We use a generalized Pareto distribution to model the infectivity. This distribution has a fat tail and models the presence of super-spreaders that contribute to the disease progression. While both models capture the detected numbers well, the predictions of affected numbers from the continuum model are more realistic.

Our results are consistent with corresponding trends obtained from published serological studies in Spain, the UK and Italy.

We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain. METHODS: We did a dose-escalation, single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, phase 1 trial of an Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in Wuhan, China. Healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years were sequentially enrolled and allocated to one of three dose groups (5â×â1010, 1â×â1011, and 1·5â×â1011 viral particles) to receive an intramuscular injection of vaccine. The primary outcome was adverse events in the 7 days post-vaccination. Safety was assessed over 28 days post-vaccination. Specific antibodies were measured with ELISA, and the neutralising antibody responses induced by vaccination were detected with SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation and pseudovirus neutralisation tests. T-cell responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot and flow-cytometry assays. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04313127. FINDINGS: Between March 16 and March 27, 2020, we screened 195 individuals for eligibility. Of them, 108 participants (51% male, 49% female; mean age 36·3 years) were recruited and received the low dose (n=36), middle dose (n=36), or high dose (n=36) of the vaccine. All enrolled participants were included in the analysis. At least one adverse reaction within the first 7 days after the vaccination was reported in 30 (83%) participants in the low dose group, 30 (83%) participants in the middle dose group, and 27 (75%) participants in the high dose group. The most common injection site adverse reaction was pain, which was reported in 58 (54%) vaccine recipients, and the most commonly reported systematic adverse reactions were fever (50 [46%]), fatigue (47 [44%]), headache (42 [39%]), and muscle pain (18 [17%]. Most adverse reactions that were reported in all dose groups were mild or moderate in severity. No serious adverse event was noted within 28 days post-vaccination. ELISA antibodies and neutralising antibodies increased significantly at day 14, and peaked 28 days post-vaccination. Specific T-cell response peaked at day 14 post-vaccination. INTERPRETATION: The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine is tolerable and immunogenic at 28 days post-vaccination. Humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 peaked at day 28 post-vaccination in healthy adults, and rapid specific T-cell responses were noted from day 14 post-vaccination. Our findings suggest that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine warrants further investigation.

Recognizing and correcting the key and immediate dysfunctions may reduce mortality. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 66-year-old previously healthy male patient was referred to the isolation ward in Guanggu Branch of Hubei Province Maternity and Childcare Hospital with a high fever and nonproductive cough for twenty days. DIAGNOSES: Diagnosis of severe COVID-19 infectious pneumonia was established by travel history, clinical features, chest imaging, and a positive oropharyngeal swab specimen result for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RT-PCR assay. INTERVENTIONS: In addition to standard supportive care, combined inflammatory cytokine depletion therapy (double filtration plasma pheresis and tocilizumab) and convalescent plasma were administered. OUTCOMES: The patient's homeostatic parameters (blood pressure, heart rate, spontaneous respiration, SPO2, and blood gas) recovered, along with the recovery on chest imaging. All the intravenous catheters were removed. Supportive care continued for several days, and the patient was transferred to a non-ICU isolation ward. LESSONS: It is not safe to draw causal conclusions between cytokine depletion and clinical manifestation improvement with only 1 case, but this is a potential research direction in facing the COVID-19 crisis.","Yang, Bo; Yang, Jing; Zhou, Lan; Xue, Cheng; Li, Hongxian; Hu, Weifeng; Liu, Nanmei",Medicine (Baltimore),194,1

METHODS: A pragmatic clinical trial was conducted in an intensive care unit from March 2009 to September 2016. Patients on mechanical ventilation > 24 hours who developed acute respiratory failure after scheduled extubation were included and were assigned to noninvasive ventilation or conventional oxygen therapy. The primary objective was to reduce the reintubation rate. The secondary objectives were to improve respiratory parameters and reduce complications, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the intensive care unit stay, the hospital stay, and mortality in the intensive care unit, in the hospital, and 90 days after discharge. Factors correlated with reintubation were also analyzed. RESULTS: Of a total of 2,574 patients, 77 were analyzed (38 in the noninvasive ventilation group and 39 in the conventional oxygen therapy group). Noninvasive ventilation reduced the respiratory and cardiac rates more rapidly than conventional oxygen therapy. Reintubation was less common in the noninvasive ventilation group [12 (32%) versus 22 (56%) in the conventional oxygen therapy group, relative risk 0.58 (95%CI 0.34 - 0.97), p = 0.039]. The rest of the parameters did not show significant differences. In the multivariate analysis, noninvasive ventilation protected against reintubation [OR 0.17 (95%CI 0.05 - 0.56), p = 0.004], while liver failure before extubation and the inability to maintain airway patency predisposed patients to reintubation. CONCLUSION: The use of noninvasive ventilation in patients who failed extubation could be beneficial compared to conventional oxygen therapy.","Belenguer-Muncharaz, Alberto; Mateu-Campos, Maria-Lidón; Vidal-Tegedor, Bárbara; Ferrándiz-Sellés, María-Desamparados; Micó-Gómez, Maria-Luisa; Altaba-Tena, Susana; Arlandis-Tomás, María; Álvaro-Sánchez, Rosa; Rodríguez-Martínez, Enver; Rodríguez-Portillo, Jairo",Rev. bras. ter. intensiva,194,20

While the crisis unfolds, it is instructive to explore how different governments reacted to the onslaught of an unknown disease. This research, using very recently collected and open-source data, meets this objective. The research reveals that, regarding 7 most commonly adopted preventive measures, governments have varied notably concerning their actions in relation to infection rate, disease rate, and timing of measures. The research also illustrates variations between governments for 6 countries: Australia, New Zealand, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, and the United States. As revealed in the summary independent-samples t test and Hedges' g values, both Oceanian countries (Australia and New Zealand) reacted differently compared to the other countries, which may have played a role in their low death and infection rates to date.","Uddin, Shahadat; Imam, Tasadduq; Moni, Mohammad Ali; Thow, Anne-Marie",Popul. health manag.

(Special issue: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and responses.),19.601711,1.8263663,2020,"BACKGROUND: Holding conspiracy beliefs regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been associated with reductions in both actions to prevent the spread of the infection (eg, mask wearing) and intentions to accept a vaccine when one becomes available. Patterns of media use have also been associated with acceptance of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. Here we ask whether the type of media on which a person relies increased, decreased, or had no additional effect on that person's COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs over a 4-month period. OBJECTIVE: We used panel data to explore whether use of conservative and social media in the United States, which were previously found to be positively related to holding conspiracy beliefs about the origins and prevention of COVID-19, were associated with a net increase in the strength of those beliefs from March to July of 2020. We also asked whether mainstream news sources, which were previously found to be negatively related to belief in pandemic-related conspiracies, were associated with a net decrease in the strength of such beliefs over the study period. Additionally, we asked whether subsequent changes in pandemic conspiracy beliefs related to the use of media were also related to subsequent mask wearing and vaccination intentions. METHODS: A survey that we conducted with a national US probability sample in March of 2020 and again in July with the same 840 respondents assessed belief in pandemic-related conspiracies, use of various types of media information sources, actions taken to prevent the spread of the disease and intentions to vaccinate, and various demographic characteristics. Change across the two waves was analyzed using path analytic techniques. RESULTS: We found that conservative media use predicted an increase in conspiracy beliefs (ß=.17, 99% CI .10-.25) and that reliance on mainstream print predicted a decrease in their belief (ß=-.08, 99% CI -.14 to -.02). Although many social media platforms reported downgrading or removing false or misleading content, ongoing use of such platforms by respondents predicted growth in conspiracy beliefs as well (ß=.072, 99% CI .018-.123). Importantly, conspiracy belief changes related to media use between the two waves of the study were associated with the uptake of mask wearing and changes in vaccination intentions in July. Unlike other media, use of mainstream broadcast television predicted greater mask wearing (ß=.17, 99% CI .09-.26) and vaccination intention (ß=.08, 95% CI .02-.14), independent of conspiracy beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to the need for greater efforts on the part of commentators, reporters, and guests on conservative media to report verifiable information about the pandemic. The results also suggest that social media platforms need to be more aggressive in downgrading, blocking, and counteracting claims about COVID-19 vaccines, claims about mask wearing, and conspiracy beliefs that have been judged problematic by public health authorities.","Romer, Daniel; Jamieson, Kathleen Hall",J Med Internet Res,194,1

METHODS: After PSM, 466 pairs of patients (A group, on-pump; B group, off-pump) who were aged&#8805;70 years undergoing first isolated CABG surgery from January 2012 to December 2016 entered the study. AKI was defined and classified according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. The incidence and severity of in-hospital AKI were compared. The impacts of AKI on the long-term outcomes including new onset of dialysis and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: The two PSM groups had similar baseline and procedure except whether the CPB was used or not. In hospital and 30-day mortality was of no difference(&#967;2 = 0.051, p = 0.821). AKI of any severity occurred in 40.3% of all patients, with stage 1 accounting for most cases. No difference regarding the incidence and severity of AKI could be found: AKIN stage 1: 139 (29.8%) vs 131 (28.1%); AKIN stage 2: 40 (8.6%) vs 35 (7.5%); AKIN stage 3: 18 (3.9%) vs 13 (2.8%), (u = 0.543, p = 0.532). No difference was observed in the in-hospital new onset of dialysis (&#967;2 = 0.312, P = 0.576). The use of CPB was not found to influence long-term new onset of dialysis (&#967;2 = 0.14, p = 0.708) and mortality (&#967;2 = 0.099, p = 0.753). Comparing with non-AKI patients, AKI patients were associated with an increased rates of new onset of dialysis (&#967;2 = 8.153, p = 0.004) and mortality (&#967;2 = 6.277, p = 0.012) during the follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression manifested that the HR for long-term new onset of dialysis and mortality in AKI patients vs. non-AKI patients was 1.83 and 1.31 respectively (95%CI 1.12-2.86, p = 0.007; 95%CI 1.17-2.58, p = 0.015). The HR for long-term new onset of dialysis and mortality in on-pump group vs. off-pump group was 1.07 and 1.11 respectively (95%CI 1.03-1.23, p = 0.661; 95%CI 1.09-1.64, p = 0.702). CONCLUSIONS: For elderly CABG patients, AKI was common, but deterioration of dialysis was a seldom incidence. Comparing with on-pump, off-pump did not decrease the rates or severity of AKI, long-term new onset of dialysis or mortality. AKI was associated with an increased long-term new onset of dialysis and decreased long-term survival.","Wang, Rui; Wang, Xian; Zhu, Yifan; Chen, Wen; Li, Liangpeng; Chen, Xin",J Cardiothorac Surg,194,23

However, the efficacy of Yoga has not been studied in chest trauma patients. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted at level-1 Trauma Centre. Isolated chest injury patients were randomized into either standard physiotherapy or Yogatherapy groups. Patients in physiotherapy group received conventional chest physiotherapy and Yogatherapy group received a set of Yogic exercises in addition to conventional chest physiotherapy. Primary outcome measure was changes in pulmonary function tests (PFT) at 4 weeks of discharge. Secondary outcomes were changes in quality of life (QoL), respiratory muscle strength and endurance, chest wall mobility, and levels of cytokines at 4 weeks. Data were analyzed using STATA v14.0. RESULTS: A total of 89 eligible patients were randomized to physiotherapy (n = 46) and Yoga therapy (n = 43) groups. Demographic characteristics were comparable in both the groups. There were statistically significant improvements in PFT in the Yogatherapy group compared with physiotherapy with an increase in Forced vital capacity (p = 0.02) and Forced expiratory volume (p = 0.01) at 4 weeks.

Activation of the RAS increases in patients with diabetes. The virus attaches to the ACE2 enzyme at low cytosolic pH values and enters into the cell and causes infection. Especially in the presence of diabetes mellitus and accompanying comorbid conditions such as hypertension, obesity, old age, and smoking, cytosolic pH is low, thus the virus easily may enter the cell by attaching to ACE2. ACEIs and ARBs lead to a reduction in angiotensin II level by increasing the ACE2 level, thus they cause a low cytosolic pH. Increased cardiac ACE2 levels due to ACEIs and ARBs can trigger cardiac arrhythmias and myocarditis by causing the virus to easily enter the heart tissue. There is ACE2 activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla in the brain stem. The release of angiotensin 1-7 in the brain stem leads to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This activation causes systemic vasoconstriction and the patient's blood pressure increases. The most important event is the increased sympathetic activity via the central stimulation, this activity increases pulmonary capillary leaking, causing the ARDS. As the cytosolic pH, which is already low in patients with diabetes will decrease further with the mechanisms mentioned above, the viral load will increase and the infection will be exacerbated. As a result, the use of ACEIs and ARBs in patients with diabetes can lead to increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.","Cure, Erkan; Cumhur Cure, Medine",Diabetes Metab Syndr,194,16

This is the case in Italy, one of the countries most affected by the pandemic. Given the heightened fear concerning COVID-19 in Italy., the present study analyzed the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). Methods: The sample comprised 250 Italian participants who were administered Italian versions of the FCV-19S, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Severity Measure for Specific Phobia-Adult (SMSP-A). Several psychometric tests were performed to investigate the validity and reliability of the test including confirmatory factor analysis. Results: Analysis of the data showed satisfactory psychometric characteristics and confirmed the scale's unidimensional properties. The seven FCV-19S items had acceptable correlations with the test total (from .443 to .784). Furthermore, the loadings on the factor were significant and strong (from .684 to .897). The internal consistency was very good (&#945; = .871). Construct validity for the FCV-19S was supported by significant and positive correlations with the HADS (r=.649) and SMSP-A (r=.703).

It is therefore necessary to maintain this procedure available for these patients during the COVID-19 pandemic while keeping high efficacy and safety standards. AIMS: To report outcomes of a FMT service that has adapted its operational workflow during COVID-19 pandemic to continue offering FMT to patients with CDI. METHODS: All patients with CDI referred to our center for FMT during pandemic were prospectively included. Each step of the FMT working protocol was adapted with specific security measures to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Of 26 patients evaluated for FMT, 21 were treated for recurrent or refractory CDI. Eighteen patients completed the 8-week follow-up, and no one recurred after FMT. Follow-up is ongoing in 3 patients, although in all of them diarrhea disappeared after the first procedure. No serious adverse events were reported. Two patients had also COVID-19-related pneumonia, and were cured both from CDI and COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This is the first report to show that it is possible to maintain standard volumes, efficacy and safety of FMT for recurrent CDI during the COVID-19 pandemic, by adopting specific changes in the operational workflow.","Ianiro, Gianluca; Bibbò, Stefano; Masucci, Luca; Quaranta, Gianluca; Porcari, Serena; Settanni, Carlo Romano; Lopetuso, Loris Riccardo; Fantoni, Massimo; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Cammarota, Giovanni",Dig. liver dis,194,1

METHODS: Thirty Sprague Dawley male rats were randomly divided into three groups; lower extremity ischemia-reperfusion group (Group 2), renal ischemia-reperfusion group (Group 3) and control (anesthesia and median laparotomy only) (Group 1). In group 3, 1-h ischemia was performed on the kidney and in group 2, 1-h ischemia was performed on the left lower extremity. This procedure was followed by reperfusion for 24 h. Renal tissues were removed after the reperfusion period and the groups were evaluated for glutathioneperoxidase activity, malondialdehyde and GSH levels, and furthermore, their histolopathological scores were calculated. RESULTS: Renal malondialdehyde levels were significantly higher in Group 2 and Group 3 than they were in the Control group. There was no significant difference in renal malondialdehyde levels between Group 2 and Group 3. Kidney glutathione (GSH) levels were statistically lower in Group 2 and Group 3 than in the Control group. No statistically significant difference was found between Group 2 and Group 3 regarding their GSH levels. In histological evaluation, there was no statistically significant difference between Group 2 and Group 3 in terms of kidney damage score.

Using whole-genome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, we analyzed genomes of 145 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates from active TB cases from the Rubaga Division of Kampala, Uganda. We established that these isolates grouped into M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) lineages 1, 2, 3, and 4, with the most isolates grouping into lineage 4. Possible transmission pairs containing &#8804;12 SNPs were identified in lineages 1, 3, and 4 with the prevailing transmission in lineages 3 and 4. Furthermore, investigating DNA codon changes as a result of specific SNPs in prominent virulence genes including plcA and plcB could indicate potentially important modifications in protein function.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical cross-sectional study. METHODS: This is a prospective clinical cross-sectional study of 79 children with COVID-19. The 21st item of SNOT-22 questionnaire and odor identification test were used for smell assessment. Children were examined twice during the hospitalization, and a telephone survey was conducted 60 days after hospital discharge. RESULTS: Immediately after confirmation of COVID-19, smell impairment was detected in 86.1% of children by means of the Identification test and in 68.4% of children by means of the survey (P = .010). After 5 days survey revealed a statistically significant decrease in the number of patients with hyposmia (41 out of 79, 51.9%). On the first visit, the mean Identification test score corresponded to ""hyposmia"" (9.5 ± 2.7), while on the second visit, the average value was 13.1 ± 1.9, which corresponded to ""normosmia.""

Ephedra sinica, one of the major constituent herbs of multi-component herbal formula, has been widely used to treat COVID-19 in China. However, its active components are still unclear. The objectives of this study are to screen and evaluate active components from the traditional Chinese medicine Ephedra sinica for the treatment of COVID-19. In our study, we established an ACE2/CMC bioaffinity chromatography model, and then developed an ACE2/CMC-HPLC-IT-TOF-MS system for the active compounds screening and identification from Ephedra sinica extract. We performed molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays to assess the binding characteristics (binding mode and KD value). We used CCK-8 staining to assess the toxicity of screened compounds, and also used SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to observe the viropexis effect of screened compounds in ACE2h cells. In this current work, one fraction was fished out, separated and identified as ephedrine (EP), pseudoephedrine (PEP), and methylephedrine (MEP). Binding assays showed that the three compounds could bind with ACE2 in a special way to some amino acid residues, similar to the way SARS-CoV-2 bound with ACE2. Additionally, the three compounds, especially EP, can inhibit the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus into ACE2h cells because they can reduce the entrance ratio of pseudovirus in the pseudovirus model. Overall, the ACE2/CMC-HPLC-IT-TOF-MS system was established and verified to be suitable for ACE2-targeted bioactive compound screening. EP, PEP, and MEP with ACE2-binding features were screened out from Ephedra sinica, and acted as blockers inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus entering ACE2h cells.","Lv, Yanni; Wang, Saisai; Liang, Peida; Wang, Yamin; Zhang, Xin; Jia, Qianqian; Fu, Jia; Han, Shengli; He, Langchong",Anal Bioanal Chem,194,1

The impact of the removal of mask restrictions, however, on COVID-19 outcomes for elementary students, educators/staff, and their households is not well known. MethodsWe used a previously published agent-based dynamic transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 in K-12 schools to simulate an elementary school with 638 students across 6 scenarios: combinations of three viral infectiousness levels (reflecting wild-type virus, alpha variant, and delta variant) and two student vaccination levels (0% and 50% coverage to reflect potential authorization in this age group). For each scenario, we varied observed community COVID-19 incidence (0 to 50 cases/100,000 people/day) and mitigation effectiveness (0-100% reduction to in-school secondary attack rate), and evaluated two outcomes over a 30 day period: (1) the probability of at least one in-school transmission, and (2) the increase in total cases among students, educators/staff, and their household members between in-person and remote instruction. ResultsOver 30 days in the simulated elementary school, the probability of at least one in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the number of projected infections in the immediate school community varied widely. In one scenario with the delta variant and no student vaccination, assuming that baseline mitigation measures of simple ventilation and handwashing reduce the secondary attack rate by 40%, if decision-makers seek to keep the monthly probability of an in-school transmission below 50%, additional mitigation (e.g., masking) would need to be added at a community incidence of approximately 4/100,000/day. Once students are vaccinated, thresholds shift substantially higher. LimitationsThe interpretation of model results should be limited by the uncertainty in many of the parameters, including the effectiveness of individual mitigation interventions and vaccine efficacy against the delta variant, and the limited scope of the model beyond the school community. Additionally, the assumed case detection rate (33% of cases detected) may be too high in areas with decreased testing capacity. ConclusionDespite the assumption of high adult vaccination, the risks of both in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission and resulting infections among students, educators/staff, and their household members remain high when the delta variant predominates and students are unvaccinated. Mitigation measures or vaccinations for students when available can substantially reduce these risks. These findings underscore the potential role for responsive plans, where mitigation is deployed based on local COVID-19 incidence and vaccine uptake.","Giardina, John; Bilinski, Alyssa; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C.; Kendall, Emily A.; Linas, Benjamin P.; Salomon, Joshua; Ciaranello, Andrea L.",,194,20

To define the EDI trigger, a previous dataset of 10,000 simulated FMD outbreaks in New Zealand, controlled by the standard stamping-out approach, was re-analysed at various time points between days 11-35 of each response to find threshold values of cumulative detected infected premises (IPs) that indicated upper quartile sized outbreaks and estimated dissemination rate (EDR) values that indicated sustained spread. Both sets of thresholds were then parameterised within the InterSpread Plus modelling framework, such that if either the cumulative IPs or the EDR exceeded the defined thresholds, the EDI trigger would fire. A new series of simulations were then generated. The EDI trigger was like two diagnostic tests interpreted in parallel, with the diagnostic outcome positive if either test was positive at any time point between days 11-35 inclusive. The diagnostic result was then compared to the final size of each outbreak, to see if the outbreak was an upper quartile outbreak in terms of cumulative IPs and / or final duration. The performance of the EDI trigger was then evaluated across the population of outbreaks, and the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) calculated. The Se, Sp, PPV and NPV for predicting large outbreaks were 0.997, 0.513, 0.404 and 0.998 respectively. The study showed that the EDI trigger was very sensitive to detecting large outbreaks, although not all outbreaks predicted to be large were so, whereas outbreaks predicted to be small invariably were small. Therefore, it shows promise as a mechanism that could support an adaptive management approach to FMD control.","Sanson, Robert L; Yu, Zhidong D; Rawdon, Thomas G; van Andel, Mary",,194,30

We have come up with some prognostic factors to predict the severity of COVID-19 among hypertensive patients. In addition, epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory differences among COVID-19 patients with and without underlying hypertension were evaluated. METHODS: Medical profiles of 598 COVID-19 cases were analyzed. Patients were divided into two comparative groups according to their positive or negative history of hypertension. Then, epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory and radiological features and also clinical outcomes were compared. RESULTS: 176 (29.4%) patients had underlying hypertension. Diabetes was significantly higher in hypertensive group [72 (40.9%) vs 76 (18%)] (P-value: 0.001). Cardiovascular and renal disorders were significantly higher in hypertensive patients.

This type of threat can stem from both malicious users with a motive as well as negligent users who inadvertently reveal details about trade secrets, company information, or even access information to malignant players. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses system logs to detect insider behavior using a special recurrent neural network (RNN) model. Ground truth is established using DANTE and used as the baseline for identifying anomalous behavior. For this, system logs are modeled as a natural language sequence and patterns are extracted from these sequences. We create workflows of sequences of actions that follow a natural language logic and control flow. These flows are assigned various categories of behaviors - malignant or benign. Any deviation from these sequences indicates the presence of a threat. We further classify threats into one of the five categories provided in the CERT insider threat dataset. Through experimental evaluation, we show that the proposed model can achieve 99% prediction accuracy.","Rastogi, Nidhi; Ma, Qicheng",,194,24

We apply the SIRD epidemiology model for estimating the basic reproduction number of the new coronavirus disease for multiple different countries. Methods: For estimating of the basic reproduction number values, we fit the SIRD model using the Runge-Kutta simulation method in addition to the analytical solution of parts of the model. We use the collected data of the new coronavirus pandemic reported up to date July 30, 2020 in India, the Syrian Arab Republic, the United States, France, Nigeria, Yemen, China and Russia. Results: We find that the basic reproduction numbers of the new coronavirus disease are located in the range [1.0011-2.7936] for the different location countries and the values of the ratio between the rate of recovery and the rate of mortality are between 1.5905 for Yemen and 44.0805 for Russia. Also, we find the dates of the actual decreasing of Covid-19 cases in five countries. Conclusions: We find that the basic reproductive number is between 1.0011 for the smallest value and 2.7936 for the greatest value.

However, public opinion reports an associated subjective shortness of breath. We evaluated cardiorespiratory parameters at rest and during maximal exertion to highlight any differences with the use of protection masks. METHODS: Twelve healthy subjects underwent three cardiopulmonary exercise tests: without wearing protection mask, with surgical and with FFP2 mask. Dyspnea was assessed by Borg Scale. Standard pulmonary function tests were also performed. RESULTS: All the subjects (40.8±12.4â years; 6 males) completed the protocol with no adverse event. At spirometry, from no mask to surgical to FFP2, a progressive reduction of FEV1 and FVC was observed (3.94±0.91â l, 3.23±0.81â l, 2.94±0.98â l and 4.70±1.21â l, 3.77±1.02â l, 3.52±1.21â l, respectively, p<0.001). Rest ventilation, O2 uptake (VÌO2) and CO2 production (VCO2) were progressively lower with a reduction of respiratory rate. At peak exercise, subjects revealed a progressively higher Borg scale when wearing surgical and FFP2. Accordingly, at peak exercise, VÌO2 (31.0±23.4, 27.5±6.9, 28.2±8.8â ml/kg/min, p=0.001), ventilation (92±26, 76±22, 72±21â l, p=0.003), respiratory rate (42±8, 38±5, 37±4, p=0.04) and tidal volume (2.28±0.72, 2.05±0.60, 1.96±0.65â l, p=0.001) were gradually lower. We did not observed a significant difference in oxygen saturation. CONCLUSIONS: Protection masks are associated with significant but modest worsening of spirometry and cardiorespiratory parameters at rest and peak exercise. The effect is driven by a ventilation reduction due to an increased airflow resistance. However, since exercise ventilatory limitation is far from being reached, their use is safe even during maximal exercise, with a slight reduction in performance.","Mapelli, Massimo; Salvioni, Elisabetta; De Martino, Fabiana; Mattavelli, Irene; Gugliandolo, Paola; Vignati, Carlo; Farina, Stefania; Palermo, Pietro; Campodonico, Jeness; Maragna, Riccardo; Lo Russo, Gerardo; Bonomi, Alice; Sciomer, Susanna; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe",Eur. respir. j,194,20

This study examines education changes spurred by COVID-19. METHODS: Data were collected via a Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance survey of family medicine clerkship directors. Participants answered questions about didactic and clinical changes made to clerkship teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic, how positive the changes were, whether the changes would be made permanent, and how prepared clerkship directors were for the changes. RESULTS: The response rate was 64%. The most frequent change made to didactic teaching was increasing online resources. The most frequent change made to clinical teaching was adding clinical simulation. Greater changes were made to clinical teaching than to didactic teaching. Changes made to didactic teaching were perceived as more positive for student learning than the changes made to clinical teaching. Clerkship directors felt more prepared for changes to didactic teaching than for clinical teaching, and were more likely to make the didactic teaching changes permanent than the clinical teaching changes. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic caused nearly all clerkship directors to make changes to clerkship teaching, but few felt prepared to make these changes, particularly changes to clinical teaching. Clerkship directors made fewer changes to didactic teaching than clinical teaching, however, didactic changes were perceived as more positive than clinical changes and were more likely to be adopted long term.","Everard, Kelly M; Schiel, Kimberly Zoberi",Fam Med,194,16

PURPOSE: Patients with a reported ß-lactam allergy (BLA) are often given alternative perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, increasing risk of surgical site infections (SSIs), acute kidney injury (AKI), and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). The purpose of this study was to implement and evaluate a pharmacist-led BLA clarification interview service in the preoperative setting. METHODS: A pharmacist performed BLA clarification telephone interviews before elective procedures from November 2018 to March 2019. On the basis of allergy history and a decision algorithm, first-line preoperative antibiotics, alternative antibiotics, or allergy testing referral was recommended. The pharmacist intervention (PI) group was compared to a standard of care (SOC) group who underwent surgery from November 2017 to March 2018. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were included, with 50 (57%) and 37 (43%) in the SOC and PI groups, respectively. The most common surgeries included orthopedic surgery in 41 patients (47%) and neurosurgery in 17 patients (20%). In the PI group, all BLA labels were updated after interview. Twenty-three patients were referred for allergy testing, 12 of the 23 (52%) completed BLA testing, and penicillin allergies were removed for 9 of the 12 patients. Overall, 28 of the 37 (76%) pharmacy antibiotic recommendations were accepted. Cefazolin use significantly increased from 28% to 65% after the intervention (P = 0.001). SSI occurred in 5 (10%) patients in the SOC group and no patients in the PI group (P = 0.051). All of these SSIs were associated with alternative antibiotics. Incidence of AKI and CDI was similar between the groups. No allergic reactions occurred in either group. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a pharmacy-driven BLA reconciliation significantly increased ß-lactam preoperative use without negative safety outcomes.","Kwiatkowski, Shaina; Mulugeta, Surafel; Davis, Susan; Kenney, Rachel; Kalus, James; Walton, Leslie; Patel, Nisha",Am. j. health system pharm,194,5

We aimed to track molecular evolution and spread of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Esteio (Southern Brazil) using phylogenetics and phylodynamics inferences from 21 new genomes in global and regional context. Importantly, the case fatality rate (CFR) in Esteio (3.26%) is slightly higher compared to the Rio Grande do Sul (RS) state (2.56%) and the entire Brazil (2.74%). RESULTS: We provided a comprehensive view of mutations from a representative sampling from May to October 2020, highlighting two frequent mutations in spike glycoprotein (D614G and V1176F), an emergent mutation (E484K) in spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) characteristic of the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages, and the adjacent replacement of 2 amino acids in Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (R203K and G204R). E484K was found in two genomes from mid-October, which is the earliest description of this mutation in Southern Brazil. Lineages containing this substitution must be subject of intense surveillance due to its association with immune evasion. We also found two epidemiologically-related clusters, including one from patients of the same neighborhood. Phylogenetics and phylodynamics analysis demonstrates multiple introductions of the Brazilian most prevalent lineages (B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.248) and the establishment of Brazilian lineages ignited from the Southeast to other Brazilian regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show the value of correlating clinical, epidemiological and genomic information for the understanding of viral evolution and its spatial distribution over time. This is of paramount importance to better inform policy making strategies to fight COVID-19.","Franceschi, Vinícius Bonetti; Caldana, Gabriel Dickin; de Menezes Mayer, Amanda; Cybis, Gabriela Bettella; Neves, Carla Andretta Moreira; Ferrareze, Patrícia Aline Gröhs; Demoliner, Meriane; de Almeida, Paula Rodrigues; Gularte, Juliana Schons; Hansen, Alana Witt; Weber, Matheus Nunes; Fleck, Juliane Deise; Zimerman, Ricardo Ariel; Kmetzsch, Lívia; Spilki, Fernando Rosado; Thompson, Claudia Elizabeth",BMC Genomics,194,16

The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are highly variable ranging from mild presentations to severe, life-threatening symptoms and the wide individual variability may be due to the broad heterogeneity in the underlying pathologies. There is no doubt that early management may have a major influence on the outcome. This led the scientists to search for ways to monitor disease progression or to predict outcomes in COVID-19. Although it is not yet possible to predict who will progress to the severe forms or in what time, numerous prospective and longitudinal studies represent the evidence for determining the potential immunological risk factors of COVID-19 critical disease and death. The kinetics and breadth of immune responses during COVID-19 appear to follow a trend which is consistent to the predominant pathological alterations. Recent publications have used these biomarkers to help identify patients who will develop the severe acute COVID-19. Of particular interest is the relationship between the kinetics of peripheral leukocytes and clinical progress of the disease in COVID-19. Although research is ongoing in this area, we present details about the current status of the evaluation. Understanding of the COVID-19 related alterations of the innate and adaptive immune responses may help to promote the vaccine development and immunological interventions.","Ghaebi, Mahnaz; Tahmasebi, Safa; Jozghorbani, Maryam; Sadeghi, Alireza; Thangavelu, Lakshmi; Zekiy, Angelina Olegovna; Esmaeilzadeh, Abdolreza",Life Sci,194,27

Hence, we aim to evaluate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 related cardiovascular complications and secondary infection and their possibility as potential triggers for the stroke. METHODS: Data from observational studies describing the complications [acute cardiac injury (ACI), cardiac arrhythmias (CA), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), septic shock, secondary infection] and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalized patients from December 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020, were extracted following PRISMA guidelines. Adverse outcomes defined as intensive care units, oxygen saturation less than 90%, invasive mechanical ventilation, severe disease, and in-hospital mortality. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were obtained, and forest plots were created using random-effects models. A short review of these complications as triggers of stroke was conducted. RESULTS: 16 studies with 3480 confirmed COVID-19 patients, prevalence of ACI [38%vs5.9%], CA [26%vs5.3%], DIC [4%vs0.74%], septic shock [18%vs0.36%], and infection [30%vs12.5%] was higher among patients with poor outcomes.

Using data collected via remote measurement technology from a mobile physical activity tracker, this study aimed to describe the longitudinal trajectories of physical activity following the start of lockdown among students at a large UK university, and to investigate whether these trajectories varied according to age, gender, and ethnicity. Continuous physical activity data for steps walked per week (n = 730) and miles run per week (n = 264) were analysed over the first period of lockdown and subsequent restriction easing using negative binomial mixed models for repeated measures. Throughout the observation period, more steps were walked by males compared to females, and by White groups compared to all other ethnic groups combined. However, there was a gradual increase in the number of steps walked per week following the commencement of lockdown, irrespective of sociodemographic characteristics. For females only, there was a decrease in the number of miles run per week following lockdown. The long-term impact of the pandemic on physical health is unknown, but our results highlight changes in physical activity which could have implications for physical health.","Wickersham, Alice; Carr, Ewan; Hunt, Ryan; Davis, Jordan P; Hotopf, Matthew; Fear, Nicola T; Downs, Johnny; Leightley, Daniel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),194,20

This article describes surveillance for COVID-19 in HCWs at a tertiary healthcare facility, and documents the outcomes. A descriptive cross-sectional study of all HCWs identified from surveillance for COVID-19 from March 31 to August 31, 2020 was conducted. Healthcare workers were categorized as high risk and low risk using an adapted WHO Risk Assessment tool. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens obtained from high-risk subjects were tested by a reverse transcriptase PCR method. Data were analyzed with IBM SPSS version 25.0 software (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0, Armonk, NY), and results were presented as frequencies and percentages. The level of significance was set at P &lt; 0.05. During 5 months of surveillance, 1,466 HCWs with a mean age of 38.1 ± 9.7 years were identified as contacts. On risk assessment, 328 (22.4%) were adjudged high risk. High risk was associated with increasing age (P &lt; 0.001), male gender (P = 0.001), and nonclinical staff (P = 0.002). Following testing, 78 (5.3%) in the high-risk category were confirmed to have COVID-19. There was no record of COVID-19 in HCWs adjudged low risk. Forty-four (56.4%) cases were epidemiologically linked to the community, 20 (25.7%) to patients, and 14 (17.9%) to another HCW. Surveillance and risk assessment are crucial to COVID-19 response in healthcare facilities and revealed HCW infections with predominantly nonoccupational epidemiological links in this study","Obaseki, D.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of non-randomized trials. PATIENTS: Databases of EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL were systematically searched from its inception until March 2021. INTERVENTIONS: COVID-19 patients being positioned in the prone position either whilst awake or mechanically ventilated. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were oxygenation parameters (PaO2/FiO2 ratio, PaCO2, SpO2). Secondary outcomes included the rate of intubation and mortality rate. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies (n = 1712 patients) were included in this review. In comparison to the supine group, prone position significantly improved the PaO2/FiO2 ratio (study = 13, patients = 1002, Mean difference, MD 52.15, 95% CI 37.08 to 67.22; p < 0.00001) and SpO2 (study = 11, patients = 998, MD 4.17, 95% CI 2.53 to 5.81; p &#8804;0.00001). Patients received prone position were associated with lower incidence of mortality (study = 5, patients = 688, Odd ratio, OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.80; p = 0.007). No significant difference was noted in the incidence of intubation rate (study = 5, patients = 626, OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.86; p = 0.42) between the supine and prone groups. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis demonstrated that prone position improved PaO2/FiO2 ratio with better SpO2 than supine position in COVID-19 patients. Given the limited number of studies with small sample size and substantial heterogeneity of measured outcomes, further studies are warranted to standardize the regime of prone position to improve the certainty of evidence.

Here, we compared the gut mycobiota of 67 COVID-19 patients, 35 H1N1-infected patients and 48 healthy controls (HCs) using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 3-ITS4 sequencing and analysed their associations with clinical features and the bacterial microbiota. Compared to HCs, the fungal burden was higher. Fungal mycobiota dysbiosis in both COVID-19 and H1N1-infected patients was mainly characterized by the depletion of fungi such as Aspergillus and Penicillium, but several fungi, including Candida glabrata, were enriched in H1N1-infected patients. The gut mycobiota profiles in COVID-19 patients with mild and severe symptoms were similar. Hospitalization had no apparent additional effects. In COVID-19 patients, Mucoromycota was positively correlated with Fusicatenibacter, Aspergillus niger was positively correlated with diarrhoea, and Penicillium citrinum was negatively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP). In H1N1-infected patients, Aspergillus penicilloides was positively correlated with Lachnospiraceae members, Aspergillus was positively correlated with CRP, and Mucoromycota was negatively correlated with procalcitonin. Therefore, gut mycobiota dysbiosis occurs in both COVID-19 patients and H1N1-infected patients and does not improve until the patients are discharged and no longer require medical attention.","Lv, Longxian; Gu, Silan; Jiang, Huiyong; Yan, Ren; Chen, Yanfei; Chen, Yunbo; Luo, Rui; Huang, Chenjie; Lu, Haifeng; Zheng, Beiwen; Zhang, Hua; Xia, Jiafeng; Tang, Lingling; Sheng, Guoping; Li, Lanjuan",Commun Biol,194,26

However, the mechanism for matrikine regulation in acute inflammation has not been well established. Here, we show that these peptides are actively transported from the lung by the oligopeptide transporter, PEPT2. Following intratracheal instillation of Ac-PGP in a mouse model, there was a rapid decline in concentration of the labeled peptide in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) over time and redistribution to extrapulmonary sites. In vitro knockdown of the PEPT2 transporter in airway epithelia or use of a competitive inhibitor of PEPT2, cefadroxil, significantly reduced uptake of Ac-PGP. Animals that received intratracheal Ac-PGP plus cefadroxil had higher levels of Ac-PGP in BAL and lung tissue. Utilizing an acute LPS-induced lung injury model, we demonstrate that PEPT2 blockade enhanced pulmonary Ac-PGP levels and lung inflammation. We further validated this effect using clinical samples from patients with acute lung injury in coculture with airway epithelia. This is the first study to our knowledge to determine the in vitro and in vivo significance of active matrikine transport as a mechanism of modulating acute inflammation and to demonstrate that it may serve as a potential therapeutic target.","Robison, Sarah W.; Li, JinDong; Viera, Liliana; Blackburn, Jonathan P.; Patel, Rakesh P.; Blalock, J.

Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R(0) of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of R(t). In the first assumption, R(t) was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with R(t) = 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, R(t) was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (R(t) = 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (R(t) = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077–84,520 or 55,869–81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce R(t) to an ideal level and control the infection.","Wang, Huwen; Wang, Zezhou; Dong, Yinqiao; Chang, Ruijie; Xu, Chen; Yu, Xiaoyue; Zhang, Shuxian; Tsamlag, Lhakpa; Shang, Meili; Huang, Jinyan; Wang, Ying; Xu, Gang; Shen, Tian; Zhang, Xinxin; Cai, Yong",Cell Discov,194,2

To learn about how HSOs performed during the wildfires, this study interviewed U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) staff overseeing HSOs providing transitional housing under the VA's Grant and Per Diem (GPD) program to Veterans experiencing homelessness. We employed a comparative case study approach exploring GPD organizations' disaster response actions, including evacuating Veterans from wildfire‐affected areas or taking in disaster‐displaced Veterans. This article presents three themes in the GPD organizations' disaster response: (1) Organizations benefitted from close collaboration and communication with the VA during the disaster, creating a safety net to ensure Veterans' well‐being and enact rapid re‐housing to prevent homelessness; (2) Organization staff performed heroically under stressful disaster conditions; and (3) Organizations benefitted from the written disaster plans that VA requires them to create, but were not as well‐prepared for wildfires as they had been for earthquakes.

Comparative homology modelling may have the potential to close this gap by predicting protein structure in target sequences using existing experimentally solved structures as templates. This paper presents the first use of force-directed graphs for the visualization of sequence space in two dimensions, and applies them to the choice of suitable RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) target-template pairs within human-infective RNA virus genera. Measures of centrality in protein sequence space for each genus were also derived and used to identify centroid nearest-neighbour sequences (CNNs) potentially useful for production of homology models most representative of their genera. Homology modelling was then carried out for target-template pairs in different species, different genera and different families, and model quality assessed using several metrics. Reconstructed ancestral RdRP sequences for individual genera were also used as templates for the production of ancestral RdRP homology models. High quality ancestral RdRP models were consistently produced, as were good quality models for target-template pairs in the same genus. Homology modelling between genera in the same family produced mixed results and inter-family modelling was unreliable. We present a protocol for the production of optimal RdRP homology models for use in further experiments, e.g. docking to discover novel anti-viral compounds.

To investigate the experiences and outcomes of multiple stakeholders (student mentees, mentors and patients) engaged in musculoskeletal physical therapy telehealth e-mentoring across two universities (UK and Canada). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using case study design, we will use sequential mixed methods involving qualitative and quantitative components based on existing evidence. To examine the influence of telehealth e-mentoring on health outcomes in patients with musculoskeletal complaints, we will use patient-reported outcomes for satisfaction, patient empowerment and change in musculoskeletal health. We will conduct semistructured interviews to explore the development of critical thinking, clinical reasoning, communication skills and confidence of students engaged in telehealth e-mentoring. To explore the mentor acceptability and appropriateness of telehealth e-mentoring, we will conduct a focus group in each site. Finally, we will include a focus group of participants from each site to allow a cross-cultural comparison of findings to inform international stakeholders. Quantitative data will be analysed using descriptive statistics (median and IQR) to describe changes in outcome data and qualitative data will be analysed following the Framework Method.

The main objective of this survey was to investigate the initial experiences of neurologists with the use of telemedicine for different neurological conditions during the first phase of the COVID‐19. METHODS: All hospital‐based neurologists in Norway (n = 400) were invited to a questionnaire survey by e‐mail in April 2020. The study focused on telemedicine and all questions were answered with regard to the first weeks of the pandemic lockdown in Norway. RESULTS: One‐hundred and thirty‐five neurologists responded. Overall, 87% reported a shift toward more telemedicine, with significantly more use of telephone than video consultations for both new referrals (54% vs. 30%, P < 0.001) and follow‐ups (99% vs. 50%, P < 0.001). Respondents deemed it much more professionally satisfactory to conduct follow‐up consultations by telephone, than to carry out consultations with new patients by telephone (85% vs. 13%, P < 0.001). Teleconsultations were better suited for headache and epilepsy patients as compared to multiple sclerosis and movement disorder patients. There was no significant difference between residents and senior consultants regarding how they experienced teleconsultations. Female neurologists found telemedicine better and more effective than male neurologists.

Now that the vaccine is available to priority populations, it is critical to convince those that are hesitant to take the vaccine. Public health communication about the vaccine as well as misinformation on the vaccine occurs through a variety of different information channels. Some channels of information are more commonly found to spread misinformation. Given the expansive information environment, we sought to characterize the use of different media channels for COVID-19 vaccine information and determine the relationship between information channel and vaccine acceptance. We conducted a convenience sample of vaccine priority groups (N=2,650) between December 13 and 23, 2020 and conducted bivariate chi-squared tests and multivariable multinomial logistic regression analyses to determine the relative impact of channels of information on vaccine acceptance. We found traditional channels of information, especially National TV, National newspapers, and local newspapers increased the relative risk of vaccine acceptance. Individuals who received information from traditional media compared to social media or both traditional and social media were most likely to accept the vaccine. The implications of this study suggest social media channels have a role to play in educating the hesitant to accept the vaccine, while traditional media channels should continue to promote data-driven and informed vaccine content to their viewers.","Piltch-Loeb, R.; Savoia, E.; Goldberg, B.; Hughes, B.; Verhey, T.; Kayyem, J.; Miller-Idriss, C.; Testa, M.",,194,22

The pathogenic mechanism of this novel reovirus is unknown. Reovirus pathogenicity has been associated with virus-induced apoptosis in cultured cells and in vivo. The reovirus outer capsid protein μ1 is recognized as the primary determinant of reovirus-induced apoptosis. Here, we investigated the apoptosis induced by BYD1, its outer capsid protein μ1, and its cell-attachment protein σ1 to understand the pathogenesis of BYD1. We also investigated BYD1 caused systemic complications in suckling mice. Under electron microscopy, BYD1-infected cells showed characteristics typical of apoptosis. Notably, ectopically expressed μ1 and σ1 induced similar pathological apoptosis, independent of BYD1 infection, in host cells in which they were expressed, which suggests that μ1 and σ1 are both apoptotic virulence factors. Consistent with previous reports of reovirus pathogenicity, suckling mice intracranially inoculated with BYD1 developed central nerve damage, myocarditis, and pneumonia. Collectively, our data suggest that BYD1 μ1- and σ1-induced apoptosis is involved in the multi-organ lesions in a suckling mouse BYD1 infection model.","Song, Lihua; Lu, Yongfeng; He, Jun; Yu, Yonghui; Zuo, Tingting; Li, Yanwei; Zhu, Hong; Duan, Qing",PLoS One,194,26

BACKGROUND: In-service education cannot reach its best potential outcomes without strong leadership. Nurse managers are in a position of adopting leadership styles and creating conditions for enhancing the in-service education outcomes. DESIGN: We conducted a comparative cross-sectional study between British and Finnish nurses (N = 180; United Kingdom: n = 86; Finland: n = 94). METHODS: A modified ""Rapid Response Team Survey"" was used in data collection. A sample of medical and surgical registered nurses were recruited from acute care hospitals. Self-reporting, self-reflection, and case-scenarios were used to assess nurses' attitudes, practice, and knowledge. Data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney-U and Chi-square tests. RESULTS: Nurses' views on education programs were positive; however, low confidence, delays caused by hospital culture, and fear of criticism remained barriers to post education management of deteriorating patients. Nurses' self-reflection on their management of deteriorating patients indicates that 20-25% of deteriorating patients are missed. CONCLUSION: Nurse managers should promote a no-blame culture, mitigate unnecessary hospital culture and routines, and facilitate in-service education focusing on identification and management of deteriorating patients, simultaneously improving nurses' confidence.","Azimirad, Mina; Magnusson, Carin; Wiseman, Allison; Selander, Tuomas; Parviainen, Ilkka; Turunen, Hannele",Nurse Educ Pract,194,1

Since the INS records do not include clinical variables of comorbidity in the total number of cases reported as positive, but only in patients with fatal outcome, comorbidities, age and sex available in the daily INS reports were reviewed. Their frequency was identified and mortality risk behavior for the analyzed variables was established and compared with the behavior described in the international literature. Of the 100 cases, 63 were male, the mean age was 65.75 ± 18.11 years, and in 22 of them no comorbidity had been reported. The most frequently reported comorbidities were arterial hypertension (35%), diabetes mellitus (21%), cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (19%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16%), obesity (12%), smoking (9%) and thyroid disease (8%). Patients over 60 years of age presented a higher risk of mortality (OR 10.31, IC95% 6.67-15.94, p < 0.0001).

Methods We report key epidemiological details of three major hospital outbreaks of SARS in mainland China, and estimate the evolution of the effective reproduction number in each of the three hospitals during the course of the outbreaks. Results The three successive hospital outbreaks infected 41, 99 and 91 people of whom 37%, 60% and 70% were hospital staff. These cases resulted in 33 deaths, five of which occurred in hospital staff. In a multivariate logistic regression, age and whether or not the case was a healthcare worker (HCW) were found to be significant predictors of mortality. The estimated effective reproduction numbers (95% CI) for the three epidemics peaked at 8 (5, 11), 9 (4, 14) and 12 (7, 17). In all three hospitals the epidemics were rapidly controlled, bringing the reproduction number below one within 25, 10 and 5 days respectively. Conclusions This work shows that in three major hospital epidemics in Beijing and Tianjin substantially higher rates of transmission were initially observed than those seen in the community. In all three cases the hospital epidemics were rapidly brought under control, with the time to successful control becoming shorter in each successive outbreak.","Cooper, Ben S.; Fang, Li‐Qun; Zhou, Jie‐Ping; Feng, Dan; Lv, Hui; Wei, Mao‐Ti; Wang, Shi‐Xin; Cao, Wu‐Chun; De Vlas, Sake J.",Trop Med Int Health,194,2

Sensing of viral products leads to the activation of a signaling cascade that ultimately results in transcriptional activation of Type I and III interferons, as well as other antiviral genes that mediate viral clearance and inhibit viral spread. Therefore, in order for viruses to replicate and spread efficiently, they must inhibit the host signaling pathways that induce the innate antiviral immune response. In this review, we will highlight recent advances the understanding of the mechanisms by which viruses evade PRR detection, intermediate signaling molecule activation, transcription factor activation, and the actions of antiviral proteins.","Beachboard, Dia C.; Horner, Stacy M.",Current Opinion in Microbiology,194,20

Current treatments are limited in both availability and efficacy, such that improving our understanding of the factors that facilitate infection is urgently needed to more effectively treat infected individuals and to curb the pandemic. We and others have previously demonstrated the significance of interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, integrin α5β1, and human ACE2 to facilitate viral entry into host cells in vitro. We previously found that inhibition of integrin α5β1 by the clinically validated small peptide ATN-161 inhibits these spike protein interactions and cell infection in vitro. In continuation with our previous findings, here we have further evaluated the therapeutic potential of ATN-161 on SARS-CoV-2 infection in k18-hACE2 transgenic (SARS-CoV-2 susceptible) mice in vivo. We discovered that treatment with single or repeated intravenous doses of ATN-161 (1 mg/kg) within 48 h after intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 lead to a reduction of lung viral load, viral immunofluorescence, and improved lung histology in a majority of mice 72 h post-infection. Furthermore, ATN-161 reduced SARS-CoV-2-induced increased expression of lung integrin α5 and αv (an α5-related integrin that has also been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 interactions) as well as the C–X–C motif chemokine ligand 10 (Cxcl10), further supporting the potential involvement of these integrins, and the anti-inflammatory potential of ATN-161, respectively, in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the potential therapeutic efficacy of targeting integrin α5β1 in SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo and supports the development of ATN-161 as a novel SARS-CoV-2 therapy.","Amruta, Narayanappa; Engler-Chiurazzi, Elizabeth B.; Murray-Brown, Isabel C.; Gressett, Timothy E.; Biose, Ifechukwude J.; Chastain, Wesley H.; Befeler, Jaime B.; Bix, Gregory",Life Sci,194,2

The VP1 nuclear localization also occurred in the cells infected with CVB3. Truncation analysis indicated that the VP1 nuclear localization sequence located near the C-terminal. The substitution of His220 with threonine completely abolished its translocation. The VP1 proteins of other CVB types might have the nuclear localization potential because this region was highly conserved. Moreover, the VP1 nuclear localization induced cell cycle deregulation, including a prolonged S phase and shortened G2-M phase.

To correlate interleukin-6 levels in COVID-19 patients with olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions and to investigate the role of IL-6 in the onset of these disorders, this observational study investigated 67 COVID-19 patients with taste or smell disorders or both, who did not require intensive care admission, admitted at COVID Hospital of Policlinico of Bari from March to May 2020. Interleukin-6 was assayed in COVID-19 patients with taste or smell disturbances at the time of admission and at the time of swab negativization. At the same time, patients have been given a specific survey to evaluate the severity of taste and smell disturbances. Of 125 patients with smell or taste dysfunctions at onset of disease, 67 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, while 58 were excluded because 35 of them required intensive care admission, 5 were unable to answer, 5 died, 7 had finished chemotherapy recently, and 5 refused to participate. The evaluation of taste and smell disorders was carried out using a survey performed at the time of admission and at the time of swab negativization. Sinonasal outcome test 22 (SNOT-22) was used as a reference for olfactory function assessment, and Taste and Smell Questionnaire Section of the US NHANES 2011–2014 protocol (CDC 2013b) was used as reference for gustatory function assessment. A venous blood sample was taken for each patient to measure IL-6 levels upon entry and at swab negativization. Interleukin-6 levels in COVID-19 patients in relation to olfactory or gustatory disorders were correlated from the time of their admission to the time of swab negativization. Statistically significant correlations were obtained between the decrease of interleukin-6 levels and the improvement of smell (p value < 0.05) and taste (p = 0.047) functions at swab negativization.

Much of these broad spectrum protective effects are attributed to trained immunity, the epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells. As BCG vaccine is safe, cheap, widely available, amendable to use as a recombinant vector, and immunogenic, it has immense potential for use as an immunotherapeutic agent for various conditions including autoimmune, allergic, neurodegenerative, and neoplastic diseases as well as a preventive measure against infectious agents. Of particular interest is the use of BCG vaccination to counteract the increasing prevalence of autoimmune and allergic conditions in industrialized countries attributable to reduced infectious burden as described by the ‘hygiene hypothesis.’ Furthermore, BCG vaccination has been proposed as a potential therapy to mitigate spread and disease burden of COVID-19 as a bridge to development of a specific vaccine and recombinant BCG expression vectors may prove useful for the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 antigens (rBCG-SARS-CoV-2) to induce long-term immunity. Understanding the immunomodulatory effects of BCG vaccine in these disease contexts is therefore critical. To that end, we review here BCG-induced immunomodulation focusing specifically on BCG-induced trained immunity and how it relates to the ‘hygiene hypothesis’ and COVID-19.","Moulson, Aaron J.; Av-Gay, Yossef",Immunobiology,194,1

The long-term health consequences of COVID-19 in maintenance hemodialyzed (HD) patients remain to be investigated. Methods: In this longitudinal cohort study we described the health consequences in HD patients requiring hospitalization due to COVID-19. They were interviewed three and six months (M3 and M6) after discharge with a series of standardized questionnaires. Results: Of 144 HD patients discharged from the 7th Naval Hospital in Gdansk, 79 participants were enrolled, 39 m (49.4%) and 40 f (50.6%) with a median age of 70.0 (64.0–76.5) and an HD vintage of 40 months (17.5–88). After discharge, 93.7% and 81% reported at least one persistent symptom at M3 and M6, respectively. The most common symptoms were fatigue or muscle weakness (60.76% and 47.04%) and palpitations (40.51% and 30.14%). Dyspnea with an mMRC scale grade of at least 1 was reported by 21.5% before infection, and by 43.03% and 34.25% at M3 and M6, respectively. A decrease in the quality of life was reported in all domains of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire but mainly in the pain/discomfort and anxiety dimensions. Mean EQ-VAS scores were 69.05, 61.58 and 64.38, respectively. Conclusion: Our study showed that HD patients may still experience persistent symptoms six months after recovery from COVID-19, which can further reduce their already poor health-related quality of life.

The data should be reliable, and collection, analysis and feedback as well as the action based on this data should be fast. In this article, author discusses the limitations the Low Middle income Countries (LMICs) have in implementing disease surveillance and some suggestions for improvement. RECENT FINDINGS: Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) has been implemented successfully through most of the countries in Africa though they belong to low or LMIC. Major barriers for surveillance of Healthcare Associated Infections in LMICs are non-availability of adequate number of healthcare personnel such as infection control personnel as well as not having an integrated healthcare system with an effective data flow. For some infections, not having proper diagnostic facilities is a major obstacle. An important capacity limitation in clinical laboratories of LMICs is identification of antimicrobial resistant organisms as well as other pathogens to species level. This affects the surveillance of infections and antimicrobial resistance. SUMMARY: Use of modern technology, capacity building including the human resources as well as the laboratory capacity in healthcare setting, improving data communication methods, are the main recommendations made. Education and training of healthcare staff as well as educating the general public to change the attitudes of people is another aspect that we need to concentrate.","Jayatilleke, Kushlani",Curr Treat Options Infect Dis,194,5

In our in vitro experiments, which were severely curtailed by prevailing circumstances, we used water as a substitute on the blood side. The water was saturated rapidly indicating that the system was flow limited rather than diffusion limited for oxygen transfer. Using these findings, we estimated the expected performance with blood and the results suggest that two dialysis units operating in parallel with a pure oxygen gas supply running counter-current to the blood flow, could supply up to 40% of the total required oxygen demand rate in an adult patient. While not studied, carbon dioxide elimination is likely to be feasible as well. It is thus possible that hollow fiber dialysis units operating with suitable roller pumps in a veno-venous access configuration, could serve as a cost-effective and readily available alternative or adjunct for respiratory support in the face of severe resource constraints. Verification and extension of our study is needed by well resourced laboratories who are still able to function during this unprecedented period of restrictions. If, after further studies and clinical considerations, this approach appears feasible, then consideration may be given to clinical deployment of this tech- nique in desperate situations where no alternative exists to preserve life.","Rubin, D.

As a consequence of this, receptor heteromers can be classed as new drug targets, with the potential for achieving greater specificity and selectivity over targeting their constituent receptors. We have developed the Receptor-Heteromer Investigation Technology (Receptor-HIT), which enables the detection of receptor heteromers using a proximity-based reporter system such as bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). Receptor-HIT detects heteromers in live cells and in real time, by utilising ligand-induced signals that arise from altered interactions with specific biomolecules, such as ligands or proteins. Furthermore, monitoring the interaction between the receptors and the specific biomolecules generates functional information about the heteromer that can be pharmacologically quantified. This review will discuss various applications of Receptor-HIT, including its use with different classes of receptors (e.g. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and others), its use to monitor receptor interactions both intracellularly and extracellularly, and also its use with genome-edited endogenous proteins.","Johnstone, Elizabeth K.M.; Pfleger, Kevin D.G.",Biochem Soc Trans,194,1

Yet, campaigns have often not sought input from the public in their development. OBJECTIVES: To co-produce evidenced-based infographics (EBIs) about antibiotics for common childhood infections and to evaluate their effectiveness at increasing parents’ understanding of antibiotic use. METHODS: A mixed-methods study with three phases. Phase 1 identified and summarized evidence of antibiotic use for three childhood infections (sore throat, acute cough and otitis media). In phase 2, we co-designed a series of prototype EBIs with parents and a graphic design team (focus groups). Thematic analysis was used to analyse data. Phase 3 assessed the effect of EBIs on parents’ understanding of antibiotic use for the three infections using a national online survey in the UK. RESULTS: We iteratively co-produced 10 prototype EBIs. Parents found the evidence displayed in the EBIs novel and relevant to their families. Parents did not favour EBIs that were too medically focused. Parents preferred one health message per EBI. We included eight EBIs in a national survey of parents (n = 998). EBIs improved knowledge by more than a third across the board (34%, IQR 20%–46%, P < 0.001). Respondents confirmed that EBIs were novel and potentially useful, corroborating our focus groups findings. CONCLUSIONS: Co-designed EBIs have the potential to succinctly change parents’ perceptions about antibiotics for acute respiratory tract infections in children. Further research should test EBIs in real-world settings to assess their reach as a potential public-facing intervention.","Van Hecke, Oliver; Lee, Joseph J; Butler, Chris C; Moore, Michael; Tonkin-Crine, Sarah",JAC Antimicrob Resist,194,1

Our objective was to describe the prevalence of hyposmia and hypogeusia and compare it in hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients to evaluate an association of these symptoms with disease severity. We performed a cross-sectional survey during 5 consecutive days in March 2020, within a tertiary referral center, associated outpatient clinic, and two primary care outpatient facilities in Paris. All SARS-CoV-2-positive patients hospitalized during the study period and able to be interviewed (n = 198), hospital outpatients seen during the previous month (n = 129), and all COVID-19-highly suspect patients in two primary health centers (n = 63) were included. Hospitalized patients were significantly more often male (64 vs 40%) and older (66 vs 43 years old in median) and had significantly more comorbidities than outpatients. Hyposmia and hypogeusia were reported by 33% of patients and occurred significantly less frequently in hospitalized patients (12% and 13%, respectively) than in the health centers’ outpatients (33% and 43%, respectively) and in the hospital outpatients (65% and 60%, respectively). Hyposmia and hypogeusia appeared more frequently after other COVID-19 symptoms. Patients with hyposmia and/or hypogeusia were significantly younger and had significantly less respiratory severity criteria than patients without these symptoms. Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction occurs frequently in COVID-19, especially in young, non-severe patients.

The COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in its impact on social work education as it forced students to quickly transition to online learning and leave field sites abruptly to do remote activities. The degree to which and how social work students effectively coped with these changes has not been adequately studied, despite recognition that understanding how personal experiences and affective reactions influence professional judgment and behavior is a critical social work competency. To help fill this void, a mixed-methods study was conducted using video narratives and survey data to assess the coping and self-regulation skills of a cohort of undergraduate social work students. Findings indicate that these students experienced multiple stressors in all aspects of their biopsychosocial functioning due to COVID-19. Many coping skills learned for use with clients were demonstrated by students themselves. Self-sufficient, avoidant, and socially-supported coping mechanisms were frequently used and relied on by students. Use of self-distraction and active coping increased, while denial decreased within the first month after transitioning to remote learning.

However, the inefficacy of vaccination in the elderly, especially those under nutritional control such as individuals receiving artificial nutrition after cerebral infarction or during dementia, has led to the search for an adjuvant to augment the acquired immune response in this population. The cross-talk between the gut microbiota and the host immune system is gaining attention as a potential adjuvant for vaccines. Probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics, which are commonly used to modulate gut health, may enhance the immune response and the effectiveness of vaccination in the elderly. This review summarizes the use of these gut modulators as adjuvants to boost both the innate and acquired immune responses in the elderly under nutritional control. Although the clinical evidence on this topic is limited and the initial findings await clarification through future studies with large sample sizes and proper study designs, they highlight the necessity for additional research in this field, especially in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which is disproportionately affecting the elderly.","Akatsu, Hiroyasu",Vaccines (Basel),194,1

There is little evidence of frailty prevalence amongst patients hospitalised with COVID-19, nor the impact of frailty on their survival. METHODS: Prospective observational study of all consecutive patients admitted to Salford Royal NHS Foundation (SRFT) Trust between 27th February and 28th April 2020 (wave 1), and 1st October to 10th November 2020 (wave 2) with a diagnosis of COVID-19. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Patient demographics, co-morbidities, admission level disease severity (estimated with CRP) and frailty (using the Clinical Frailty Scale, score 1–3 = not frail, score 4–9 = frail) were collected. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the time to mortality. RESULTS: A total of 693 (N = 429, wave 1; N = 264, wave 2) patients were included, 279 (N = 180, 42%, wave 1; N = 104, 38%, wave 2) were female, and the median age was 72 in wave 1 and 73 in wave 2. 318 (N = 212, 49%, wave 1; N = 106, 39%, wave 2) patients presenting were frail. There was a reduction in mortality in wave 2, adjusted Hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.60 (95%CI 0.44–0.81; p = 0.001). There was an association between frailty and mortality aHR = 1.57 (95%CI 1.09–2.26; p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Frailty is highly prevalent amongst patients of all ages admitted to SRFT with COVID-19. Higher scores of frailty are associated with increased mortality.","Khan, A; Espinoza, F R; Kneen, T; Dafnis, A; Allafi, H; Carter, B; Narro-Vidal, M; Short, R; Price, A; Upton, R; Vilches-Moraga, A",Age Ageing,194,16

A total of 1380 human cell membrane proteins were predicted to constitute the receptorome of the human-infecting virome. In addition, the combination of the random-forest model with protein-protein interactions between human and viruses predicted in previous studies enabled further prediction of the receptors for 693 human-infecting viruses, such as the Enterovirus, Norovirus and West Nile virus.

METHODS: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional design was carried out among the general Egyptian population. A convenience sampling method was used to approach the eligible participants from University Teaching Hospitals of eight governorates from May to July 2020. RESULTS: A total of 686 participants filled the questionnaire (49.4% were males, mean age 36.7 ± 11.2 years old). Half of the participants stated that they previously used a telemedicine tool, mainly to follow up laboratory results (67.3%). Video or phone calls (39.3%) and mobile applications (23.7%) were the most commonly recognized telemedicine tools by the participants. The included participants exhibited a high level of knowledge and attitude towards telemedicine. On the other hand, 21.9% stated that telemedicine services could jeopardize patient privacy. 32.8% reported that telemedicine service could lead to disclosing medical information to people who are not authorized to do so. Almost half of the participants agreed to strongly agreed that telemedicine service could increase medical errors. 60.80% of the participants said that they are more likely to prefer telemedicine than traditional ways. However, 13.70% stated that telemedicine is more likely to be challenging to use. CONCLUSION: The Egyptian population has high knowledge about the applications of telemedicine. In addition, the vast majority of Egyptians appear to perceive the benefits of telemedicine positively and are willing to use it. However, some barriers that have been found must be taken into consideration to adopt telemedicine successfully, especially for people who are old, are low educated, and live in remote areas.

This paper investigates the impact of this disruption on the progress towards the WHO 2030 target for STH. METHODS: We used two stochastic individual-based models to simulate the impact of missing one or more preventive chemotherapy (PC) rounds in different endemicity settings. We also investigated the extent to which this impact can be lessened by mitigation strategies, such as semiannual or community-wide PC. RESULTS: Both models show that without a mitigation strategy, control programmes will catch up by 2030, assuming that coverage is maintained. The catch-up time can be up to 4.5 y after the start of the interruption. Mitigation strategies may reduce this time by up to 2 y and increase the probability of achieving the 2030 target. CONCLUSIONS: Although a PC interruption will only temporarily impact the progress towards the WHO 2030 target, programmes are encouraged to restart as soon as possible to minimise the impact on morbidity. The implementation of suitable mitigation strategies can turn the interruption into an opportunity to accelerate progress towards reaching the target.","Malizia, Veronica; Giardina, Federica; Vegvari, Carolin; Bajaj, Sumali; McRae-McKee, Kevin; Anderson, Roy M; de Vlas, Sake J; Coffeng, Luc E",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,194,1

Subcutaneous drug administration can facilitate this therapy in outpatient setting, but there is limited information about this practice. We have developed an original approach for drug dosing in this context, based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) principles. The objective of this study was to describe our approach and its first results in a case series. We analyzed data from patients who received suppressive antibiotic therapy by subcutaneous (SC) route with beta-lactams as salvage therapy for prosthetic joint infection (PJI) and had TDM with PK/PD-based dose adjustment. Ten patients (six women and four men with a mean age of 77 years) were included from January 2017 to May 2020. The drugs administered by SC route were ceftazidime (n = 4), ertapenem (n = 4), and ceftriaxone (n = 2). In each patient, PK/PD-guided dosage individualization was performed based on TDM and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements. The dose interval could be prolonged from twice daily to thrice weekly in some patients, while preserving the achievement of PK/PD targets. The infection was totally controlled by the strategy in nine out the 10 patients during a median follow-up of 1,035 days (~3 years). No patient acquired carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria during the follow-up. One patient presented treatment failure with acquired drug resistance under therapy, which could be explained by late MIC determination and insufficient exposure, retrospectively. To conclude, our innovative approach, based on model-based TDM, MIC determination, and individualized PK/PD goals, facilitates, and optimizes suppressive outpatient beta-lactam therapy administered by SC route for PJI. These encouraging results advocate for larger clinical evaluation.","Goutelle, Sylvain; Conrad, Anne; Pouderoux, Cécile; Braun, Evelyne; Laurent, Frédéric; Gagnieu, Marie-Claude; Cohen, Sabine; Guitton, Jérôme; Valour, Florent; Ferry, Tristan",Front Med (Lausanne),194,1

National analyses have demonstrated changes in mortality rates for most age groups and causes of death, and with deprived populations most affected. The aims here were to establish whether similar changes have occurred across different parts of the UK (countries, cities), and to examine cause-specific trends in more detail. DESIGN: Population-based trend analysis. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Whole populations of countries and selected cities of the UK. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: European age-standardised mortality rates (calculated by cause of death, country, city, year (1981–2017), age group, sex and—for all countries and Scottish cities—deprivation quintiles); changes in rates between 5-year periods; summary measures of both relative (relative index of inequality) and absolute (slope index of inequality) inequalities. RESULTS: Changes in mortality from around 2011/2013 were observed throughout the UK for all adult age groups. For example, all-age female rates decreased by approximately 4%–6% during the 1980s and 1990s, approximately 7%–9% during the 2000s, but by <1% between 2011/2013 and 2015/2017. Equivalent figures for men were 4%–7%, 8%–12% and 1%–3%, respectively. This later period saw increased mortality among the most deprived populations, something observed in all countries and cities analysed, and for most causes of death: absolute and relative inequalities therefore increased. Although similar trends were seen across all parts of the UK, particular issues apply in Scotland, for example, higher and increasing drug-related mortality (with the highest rates observed in Dundee and Glasgow). CONCLUSIONS: The study presents further evidence of changing mortality in the UK. The timing, geography and socioeconomic gradients associated with the changes appear to support suggestions that they may result, at least in part, from UK Government ‘austerity’ measures which have disproportionately affected the poorest.","Walsh, David; McCartney, Gerry; Minton, Jon; Parkinson, Jane; Shipton, Deborah; Whyte, Bruce",BMJ Open,194,33

The independent effects were also estimated and compared. We further assessed the modification effect of within-city migration (WM) index to the associations. Results: We found a significant 1.61% (95%CI: 0.51%, 2.72%) and 0.35% (95%CI: 0.24%, 0.46%) increase in daily confirmed cases per 1 unit increase in long- and short-term AQI.

New classification criteria for childhood vasculitis have recently been proposed and are currently undergoing validation. Epidemiological clues continue to implicate infectious triggers in Kawasaki Disease and Henoch Schönlein purpura. Several genetic polymorphisms have now been described in the vasculitides that may be relevant in terms of disease predisposition or development of disease complications.

Approach: The dataset consisted of the first CXR exams of 9860 patients acquired within 2 days after their initial reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 1523 (15.5%) of whom tested positive and 8337 (84.5%) of whom tested negative for COVID-19. A sequential transfer learning strategy was employed to fine-tune a convolutional neural network in phases on increasingly specific and complex tasks. The COVID-19 positive/negative classification was performed on standard images, soft tissue images, and both combined via feature fusion. A U-Net variant was used to segment and crop the lung region from each image prior to performing classification. Classification performances were evaluated and compared on a held-out test set of 1972 patients using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the DeLong test. Results: Using full standard, cropped standard, cropped, soft tissue, and both types of cropped CXR yielded AUC values of 0.74 [0.70, 0.77], 0.76 [0.73, 0.79], 0.73 [0.70, 0.76], and 0.78 [0.74, 0.81], respectively. Using soft tissue images significantly underperformed standard images, and using both types of CXR failed to significantly outperform using standard images alone. Conclusions: The proposed method was able to automatically diagnose COVID-19 at patient presentation with promising performance, and the inclusion of soft tissue images did not result in a significant performance improvement.","Hu, Qiyuan; Drukker, Karen; Giger, Maryellen L.",J Med Imaging (Bellingham),194,16

Regions with a higher proportion of people wearing masks show better control of COVID-19, but the effectiveness of masks is still under debate due to their limited and variable efficiencies in removing respiratory particles. Here, we analyze experimental data and perform model calculations to show that this contrast can be explained by the different abundance regimes between particles and viruses. Upon short-term exposure, respiratory particles are usually in a particle-rich regime, but respiratory viruses are often in a virus-limited regime where the numbers of viruses inhaled by susceptible people are below or close to the infectious dose. This virus-limited regime ensures mask efficacy and synergy of multiple preventive measures in reducing the infection risk.","Cheng, Y.; Ma, N.; Witt, C.; Rapp, S.; Wild, P.; Andreae, M.

Bio-tech approaches have been widely used for improved vaccines development. While many viral diseases are controlled through vaccination, many still lack safe and efficacious vaccines. Additional challenges faced by academia, industry and governments are likely to come from viruses jumping species and also from the emergence of virulent variants of established viruses due to natural mutations. Also viral ecology is changing as the respective vectors adapt to new habitats as has been shown in the recent incursion by bluetongue virus into Europe. In this paper the current vaccines for livestock, horses and birds are described in a species by species order. The new promising bio-tech approaches using reverse genetics, non-replicating viral vectors, alpha virus vectors and genetic vaccines in conjunction with better adjuvants and better ways of vaccine delivery are discussed as well.","Patel, J.R.; Heldens, J.G.M.",Vaccine,194,28

Scientific literature points to vaccine hesitancy as being a major health concern. During time of pandemics, increased consciousness of health behaviors may be encountered. The current study aimed to assess attitudes to general vaccines and to COVID-19 vaccines in particular among adult (>18) Israeli general public, and among Israeli dentists and dental hygienists. Cross-sectional surveys were filled out by a total of 501 participants (361 Israeli adults >18 years, 73 dental hygienists, and 67 dentists). Along with basic demographics, participants responded to the Hebrew VAX, COVID-VAX and HCS scales. Group comparisons were analyzed using t tests and ANOVAs with Scheffe’s test used for post hoc comparisons. Dental hygienists demonstrated significantly higher anti-vaccinations approaches than both dentists (p < 0.01) and the general public (p < 0.05). In all groups, attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines were more negative compared to attitudes towards general vaccines, with hygienists demonstrating significant negative attitudes compared to dentists (p < 0.05). The general public (p = 0.56) and hygienists demonstrated increased health awareness compared to dentists (p < 0.05). As health awareness has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic primary strategies to combat vaccine hesitancy should be implemented in the general public, and in particular, an dental teams.","Shacham, Maayan; Greenblatt-Kimron, Lee; Hamama-Raz, Yaira; Martin, Leslie R.; Peleg, Oren; Ben-Ezra, Menachem; Mijiritsky, Eitan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,194,22

Various anti-inflammatory therapeutics have shown mixed efficacy in treating COVID-19, and the mechanisms by which hyperinflammation occurs are not well understood. Previous research indicated that monocytes, a key innate immune cell, undergo metabolic reprogramming and produce inflammatory cytokines when stimulated with SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that binding by the viral spike protein mediates this effect, and that drugs which regulate immunometabolism could inhibit the inflammatory response in monocytes. Monocytes stimulated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 showed a dose-dependent increase in glycolytic metabolism that was associated with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α. This response was dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, as chetomin inhibited glycolysis and cytokine production. Inhibition of glycolytic metabolism by 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) or glucose deprivation also inhibited the glycolytic response, and 2-DG strongly suppressed cytokine production. Glucose-deprived monocytes rescued cytokine production by upregulating oxidative phosphorylation, an effect which was not present in 2-DG-treated monocytes due to the known effect of 2-DG on suppressing mitochondrial metabolism. Finally, pre-treatment of monocytes with metformin strongly suppressed spike protein-mediated cytokine production in monocytes, and abrogated glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism. Likewise, metformin pre-treatment blocked cytokine induction by SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020 in direct infection experiments in monocytes. In summary, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces a pro-inflammatory immunometabolic response in monocytes that can be suppressed by metformin, and metformin likewise suppresses inflammatory responses to live SARS-CoV-2. This has potential implications for the treatment of hyperinflammation during COVID-19.","Cory, Theodore J.; Emmons, Russell S.; Yarbro, Johnathan R.; Davis, Kierstin L.; Pence, Brandt D.",bioRxiv,194,18

Anecdotal evidence suggests that PEDV is now endemic in this region, therefore genome information of circulating PEDV is important for molecular surveillance and evaluation of potential benefits of field vaccination. Here, we characterized PEDV infection on commercial Thai swine farms by screening 769 samples of feces and small intestinal contents from pigs with diarrhea between 2011 and 2016. Using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting the spike (S) gene, 153 PEDV-positive samples were further subjected to analysis of the open reading frame 3 and nucleocapsid (N) genes. Comparison of 95 samples in which nucleotide sequencing was successfully obtained for all three genes revealed evolutionary diversity among the Thai PEDV strains. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that although some Thai strains changed little from years past, others resembled more closely to the recent strains reported in China. Interestingly, eight Thai PEDV strains possessed amino acid deletions in the N protein. The PEDV sequence divergence may be responsible for driving periodic outbreaks and continued persistence of PEDV on commercial swine farms. Our findings provide important insight into regional PEDV strains in circulation, which may assist future inclusions of suitable strains for future PEDV vaccines.","Tuanthap, Supansa; Vongpunsawad, Sompong; Phupolphan, Cherdpong; Duang-in, Ausanee; Wattanaphansak, Suphot; Assavacheep, Pornchalit; Theamboonlers, Apiradee; Luengyosluechakul, Supol; Amonsin, Alongkorn; Poovorawan, Yong",PeerJ,194,24

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted with secondary data of adults admitted to SUS due to viral pneumonia between 2002 and 2015. Patient profile was characterized based on demographic and clinical variables. The association between the ten Elixhauser comorbidities and in-hospital death was investigated using Poisson regression models with robust standard errors. Results were quantified as incidence rate ratio (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and we built five models using successive inclusion of variables blocks. RESULTS: Hospital admissions for viral pneumonias decreased throughout the study period, and it was observed that 5.8% of hospitalized patients had an in-hospital death. We observed significant differences in demographic and clinical characteristics by comparing individuals who died during hospitalization with those who did not, with the occurrence of one or more comorbidities being more expressive among patients who died. Although not considered risk factors for in-hospital death, chronic pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure were the most common comorbidities. Conversely, IRR for in-hospital death increased with other neurological disorders, diabetes, cancer, obesity, and especially with HIV/AIDS. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals presenting with pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases require proper attention during hospitalization, as well as those with other neurological diseases, diabetes, cancer, obesity, and especially HIV/AIDS.

The aim of the current study was to investigate whether a PA counselling program for people with COPD, when embedded in a comprehensive outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program, increased their daily PA. METHODS: A two-armed, single blind randomized controlled trial was conducted as a component of a 12-week outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program. The participants randomized into the intervention group received five counselling sessions, based on the principles of motivational interviewing (MI), with a physiotherapist. The participants’ steps per day and other proxies of PA were measured using an accelerometer (SenseWear Pro®) at baseline, at the end of the PR program, and three months later. The group-by-time interaction effect was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 43 participants,17 were allocated to the intervention group and 26 to the usual-care control group (mean age 67.9 ± 7.9; 21 (49%) males; mean FEV1 predicted 47.1 ± 18.6). No difference between groups was found for any measure of PA at any point in time. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, counselling, based on MI, when embedded in a comprehensive PR program for people with COPD, showed no short-term or long-term effects on PA behavior. To investigate this potentially effective counselling intervention and to analyze the best method, timing and tailoring of an intervention embedded in a comprehensive outpatient PR program, further adequately powered research is needed.

The brain of archaic Homo sapiens could perceive raw detailed information without using pre-established top-down concepts, as opposed to the common understanding of the normal modern non-savant brain driven by top-down control. Some ancient genes preserved in modern humans may be expressed in rare disorders. Researchers have compared Cave Art with art made by people with autism spectrum disorder. We propose that archaic primary consciousness, as opposed to modern secondary consciousness, included a savant-like perception with a superior richness of details compared to modern man. Modern people with high frequencies of Neanderthal genes, have notable anatomical features such as increased skull width in the occipital and parietal visual areas.

It is believed that active fractions of mannoproteins (AFMs) obtained through extraction and fractionation of yeast cell walls (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) may beneficially modulate the immune system. However, studies that have evaluated this component and the effects of ageing on the immune system of dogs are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the immunological effects of AFMs in adult and elderly dogs. Three extruded iso-nutrient experimental diets were formulated: without addition of AFM (T0); with AFM at 400 mg/kg (T400); and with AFM at 800 mg/kg (T800). Thirty-six beagle dogs were used, and six experimental treatments, resulting in combinations of age (adult and elderly) and diet (T0, T400, and T800), were evaluated. On days zero, 14, and 28, blood samples were obtained for leucocyte phenotyping and phagocytosis assays. On days zero and 28, a lymphoproliferation test, quantification of reactive oxygen (H(2)O(2)) and nitrogen (NO) intermediate production, evaluation of faecal immunoglobulin A (IgA) content, and a delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity test (DCHT) were performed. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software. Repeated measure variance analyses were performed, and means were compared by the Tukey test. Values of P ≤ 0.05 were considered significant, and values of P ≤ 0.10 were considered tendencies. Dogs fed T400 tended to have higher neutrophilic phagocytic activity than dogs fed T800 (P = 0.073). Regarding reactive oxygen intermediates, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated neutrophils from animals that were fed T400 had a tendency to produce more H(2)O(2) than those from animals fed the control diet (P = 0.093). Elderly dogs, when compared to adult dogs, had lower absolute T and B lymphocyte counts, lower auxiliary T lymphocyte counts, and higher cytotoxic T lymphocyte counts (P < 0.05). A significant effect of diet, age, and time with saline inoculation was noted for the DCHT. There was no effect of diet or age on faecal IgA content in dogs.

Several reports have been published regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the residency programs; however, all studies were performed in developed countries or did not comprehensively analyze what residents think about the COVID-19 impact on their residency program. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pediatric surgery residency program in our institution as an important part of hospital medical services. METHODS: We developed and distributed a questionnaire to pediatric surgery residents in our institution who were registered from January 2015–July 2020. The questionnaire was consisting of 24 questions: a) the perspectives of residents about COVID-19 infection during their residency program; b) the learning process; c) academic evaluations; and d) residents' suggestions to improve the quality of their residency program during the outbreak. RESULTS: Most (82.6%) pediatric surgery residents agreed that elective surgeries should be postponed during the pandemic. Before the outbreak, almost all (82.6%) residents used textbooks and journals as their primary sources of learning, while during the outbreak, 69.5% of residents shifted to use online lectures either from the school or Association of Pediatric Surgeons. Interestingly, 91.3% of participants agreed that they had more time to complete their academic assignments during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has had a significant impact on the development of pediatric surgery residency programs. Moreover, the responses to the questionnaire are affected by the seniority and sex of the residents. A comprehensive approach is needed to maintain the high standard of competence of pediatric surgery without compromising our safety from the COVID-19 infection risk.","Gunadi; Balela, Naisya; Kalim, Alvin Santoso; Widitjiarso, William; Fahri, Fadil; Tedja, Audric Kenny; Purnomo, Eko; Dwihantoro, Andi; Agustriani, Nunik; Makhmudi, Akhmad",Heliyon,194,10

However, data regarding the diagnosis, clinical course, treatment, and outcomes of these patients is sparse. In particular, the ability to successfully detect SARS-CoV-2 in patients with HM remains unknown. We have previously reported 2 cases of allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) diagnosed with COVID-19 using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technique, following multiple negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing (Niu et al. Bone Marrow Transplantation - Nature). Here we examine 29 patients with a variety of HM with high suspicion for COVID-19 based on clinical presentation, lab results, and imaging, whom were tested with CRISPR and/or RT-PCR based techniques. From 3/31/20 to 7/17/20, 29 patients (age 24 to 82) with a variety of HM (20 lymphoid, 9 myeloid; Table 1), 24 of which presented with an undiagnosed respiratory illness and 5 presented while asymptomatic for testing prior to chemotherapy, were evaluated for COVID-19. While 16 patients tested positive for COVID-19 with guideline-directed nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing (including the 5 asymptomatic patients), 13 patients tested negative with the same technique. However, based on their clinical history, imaging, and disease course, concern for COVID-19 infection remained in these 13 patients. We then used CRISPR technology available at our institution (Huang et al. Biosensors and Bioelectronics) to test 8 patients who initially tested negative by RT-PCR. Surprisingly, 7 of the 8 patients tested positive for COVID-19 with either a blood sample and/or nasal swab for the SARS-CoV-2 specific N gene and ORF1ab gene. Excluding the patients who were negative by RT-PCR and not tested by CRISPR, the rate of false negativity with RT-PCR testing is significantly elevated at 29% (7/24) in our cohort of HM, which compares unfavorably with the expected false negative rates of RT-PCR techniques. A very high fatality rate was observed with 9 out of the 29 patients (31%) ultimately dying. Fifteen patients were undergoing active chemotherapy, 4 had received an autologous SCT, 6 had received an allogeneic SCT, and 4 were on surveillance. Of the 23 COVID-19 positive patients (by RT-PCR or CRISPR), 8 patients received COVID-19-directed therapy with either hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, remdesivir, and/or Covid-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) depending on their clinical status, and 4 patients expired. Of the 8 treated patients, 7 improved while 1 patient expired. For the 5 patients who were negative for RT-PCR with no CRISPR completed, 1 patient received hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin proactively due to symptoms and imaging and recovered, while 3 patients expired at outside facilities due to unknown causes. Breakdown of testing and treatment is shown in Fig. 1. The majority of our patients had undergone SCT or were actively on chemotherapy, notably lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Associated with the fact that COVID-19 is known to worsen lymphopenia, our patient's symptoms and immune response to COVID-19 is likely to differ from immunocompetent hosts. This translated into an overall worse outcome as seen by the high mortality with our patients. In our limited dataset, patients presented with a variety of symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to acute respiratory failure. Intriguingly, the 5 asymptomatic patients had lymphoid malignancies and were on chemotherapy. It is thus imperative to establish the diagnosis of COVID-19 quickly, as faster initiation of treatment has been associated with better outcomes. The 8 patients who were diagnosed and treated improved substantially. However, as seen by our dataset, a strikingly high false negative rate was observed. Thus, a high clinical suspicion must guide further workup and therapy in patients with HM who present with an undiagnosed respiratory illness consistent with COVID-19. Patients with HM can have a wide variety of presentations when infected with COVID-19. For this select patient population we must establish an algorithm to diagnose COVID-19 efficiently as we reported a high number of initial false negative COVID-19 tests before the more sensitive CRISPR revealed a positive test. In addition, treatment pathways need to be instituted to not only treat COVID-19 infection, but also provide the best treatment for these patient's underlying HM.

This model is an extension of the SIQR (susceptible-infected-quarantined-recovered) and SIRP (susceptible-infected-recovered-pathogen) models used earlier to describe various scenarios of epidemic spreading. As compared to the basic SIR model, our model takes into account two possible routes of contagion transmission: direct from the infected compartment to the susceptible compartment and indirect via some intermediate medium or fomites. Transmission rates are estimated in terms of average distances between the individuals in selected social environments and characteristic time spans for which the individuals stay in each of these environments. We also introduce a collective economic resource associated with the average amount of money or income per individual to describe the socioeconomic interplay between the spreading process and the resource available to infected individuals. The epidemic-resource coupling is supposed to be of activation type, with the recovery rate governed by the Arrhenius-like law. Our model brings an advantage of building various control strategies to mitigate the effect of epidemic and can be applied, in particular, to modeling the spread of COVID-19.","Gandzha, I.S.; Kliushnichenko, O.V.; Lukyanets, S.P.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,194,24

One Health practitioners and researchers need every advantage to developing working solutions to the world's imminent complex issues. Heath promotion and harm reduction, interrelated approaches that have seen much success over decades of use in global public health, may be important models to consider. Both use an upstream socioecological determinant of health approach to reach beyond the health sector in all health efforts, and encourage active community participation and empowerment to attain and sustain human and ecological health. This scoping review of 411 documents, believed to be the first to relate health promotion and harm reduction to One Health, searched self-declared One Health research literature for evidence of health promotion and harm reduction policies, principles and methodologies. It sought to answer the questions: “What is the scope of practice of One Health in self-declared One Health publications?” and “Are attributes of health promotion and harm reduction found in self-declared One Health-reviewed research literature?” Over half of the papers revealed no health promotion or harm reduction attributes while 7% were well-endowed with these attributes. These 7% of papers focused on deep-seated, complex health issues with systemic knowledge gaps and decision-making issues revolving around specific population vulnerabilities, social inequities and competing stakeholders. Implementing ‘on the ground change’ was a common theme in the strongest health promotion/harm reduction papers we identified. Alternatively, papers lacking health promotion or harm reduction attributes focused on managing proximate risks, primarily for infectious diseases. The addition of health promotion and harm reduction to One Health practices may help the field rise to the growing expectations for its involvement in complex global issues like pandemics and climate change.","Gallagher, Christa A.; Keehner, Jon R.; Hervé-Claude, Luis Pablo; Stephen, Craig",One Health,194,29

These challenges include the need for large, diverse, yet still representative study samples. This often means a protracted, costly, and inefficient recruitment process. Multisite clinical trials can overcome some of these hurdles but incur their own unique challenges. With recent advances in mobile health and digital technologies, there is now a promising alternative: Remote Trials. These trials are led and coordinated by a local investigative team, but are based remotely, within a given community, state, or even nation. The remote approach affords many of the benefits of multisite trials (more efficient recruitment of larger study samples) without the same barriers (cost, multisite management, and regulatory hurdles). The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global health pandemic has resulted in rapid requirements to shift ongoing clinical trials to remote delivery and assessment platforms, making methods for the conduct of remote trials even more timely. The purpose of the present review is to provide an overview of available methods for the conduct of remote tobacco-focused clinical trials as well as illustrative examples of how these methods have been implemented across recently completed and ongoing tobacco studies. We focus on key aspects of the clinical trial pipeline including remote: (1) study recruitment and screening, (2) informed consent, (3) assessment, (4) biomarker collection, and (5) medication adherence monitoring. Implications With recent advances in mobile health and digital technologies, remote trials now offer a promising alternative to traditional in-person clinical trials. Remote trials afford expedient recruitment of large, demographically representative study samples, without undo burden to a research team.

This review provides an overview of the cardiovascular effects of air pollution and uses two major events of 2020—the Australian bushfires and COVID‐19 pandemic lockdown—to illustrate the relationship between air pollution and CVD. The bushfires highlight the substantial human and economic costs associated with elevations in air pollution. Conversely, the COVID‐19‐related lockdowns demonstrated that stringent measures are effective at reducing airborne pollutants, which in turn resulted in a potential reduction in cardiovascular events. Perhaps one positive to come out of 2020 will be the recognition that tough measures are effective at reducing air pollution and that these measures have the potential to stop thousands of deaths from CVD.","Wolhuter, Kathryn; Arora, Manish; Kovacic, Jason C.",Bioessays,194,3

Many of these communities report lower vaccine confidence and lower receipt of the COVID-19 vaccine. Understanding factors that influence the multifaceted decision-making process for vaccine uptake is critical for narrowing COVID-19–related disparities. OBJECTIVE: To examine factors that members of multiethnic communities at high risk for COVID-19 infection and morbidity report as contributing to vaccine decision-making. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study used community-engaged methods to conduct virtual focus groups from November 16, 2020, to January 28, 2021, with Los Angeles County residents. Potential participants were recruited through email, video, and telephone outreach to community partner networks. Focus groups were stratified by self-identified race and ethnicity as well as age. Transcripts were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Themes were categorized by contextual, individual, and vaccine-specific influences using the World Health Organization’s Vaccine Hesitancy Matrix categories. RESULTS: A total of 13 focus groups were conducted with 70 participants (50 [71.4%] female) who self-identified as American Indian (n = 17 [24.3%]), Black/African American (n = 17 [24.3%]), Filipino/Filipina (n = 11 [15.7%]), Latino/Latina (n = 15 [21.4%]), or Pacific Islander (n = 10 [14.3%]). A total of 39 participants (55.7%) were residents from high-poverty zip codes, and 34 (48.6%) were essential workers. The resulting themes included policy implications for equitable vaccine distribution: contextual influences (unclear and unreliable information, concern for inequitable access or differential treatment, references to mistrust from unethical research studies, accessibility and accommodation barriers, eligibility uncertainty, and fears of politicization or pharmaceutical industry influence); social and group influences (inadequate exposure to trusted messengers or information, altruistic motivations, medical mistrust, and desire for autonomy); and vaccination-specific influences (need for vaccine evidence by subpopulation, misconceptions on vaccine development, allocation ambiguity, vaccination safety preferences, the importance of perceiving vaccine equity, burden of vaccine scheduling, cost uncertainty, and desire for practitioner recommendation). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this qualitative study, participants reported a number of factors that affected their vaccine decision-making, including concern for inequitable vaccine access. Participants endorsed policy recommendations and strategies to promote vaccine confidence. These results suggest that support of informed deliberation and attainment of vaccine equity will require multifaceted, multilevel policy approaches that improve COVID-19 vaccine knowledge, enhance trust, and address the complex interplay of sociocultural and structural barriers to vaccination.","Carson, Savanna L.; Casillas, Alejandra; Castellon-Lopez, Yelba; Mansfield, Lisa N.; Morris, D’Ann; Barron, Juan; Ntekume, Ejiro; Landovitz, Raphael; Vassar, Stefanie D.; Norris, Keith C.; Dubinett, Steven M.; Garrison, Nanibaa’ A.; Brown, Arleen F.",JAMA Netw Open,194,24

We undertook an individual patient-level meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in humans to describe viral dynamics and estimate the effects of antivirals used to-date. Methods: This systematic review identified case reports, case series and clinical trial data from publications between 1/1/2020 and 31/5/2020 following PRISMA guidelines. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model (Cox-PH) of time to viral clearance was fitted to respiratory and stool samples. A simplified four parameter nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) model was fitted to viral load trajectories in all sampling sites and covariate modelling of respiratory viral dynamics was performed to quantify time dependent drug effects. Findings: Patient-level data from 645 individuals (age 1 month-100 years) with 6316 viral loads were extracted. Model-based simulations of viral load trajectories in samples from the upper and lower respiratory tract, stool, blood, urine, ocular secretions and breast milk were generated. Cox-PH modelling showed longer time to viral clearance in older patients, males and those with more severe disease. Remdesivir was associated with faster viral clearance (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 9.19, p<0.001), as well as interferon, particularly when combined with ribavirin (AHR = 2.2, p=0.015; AHR = 6.04, p = 0.006).

To examine the current status of non-pharmaceutical preventive behaviors practiced during the COVID-19 outbreak and factors affecting behavioral activities, we compared to the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in Korea. METHODS: This was a serial cross-sectional population-based study in Korea with four surveys conducted on June 2 and 25, 2015 (MERS-CoV surveys), and February 4, and April 2, 2020 (COVID-19 surveys). Of 25,711 participants selected using random digit dialing numbers, 4,011 participants (aged ≥ 18 years) were successfully interviewed, for the 2020 COVID-19 (n = 2,002) and 2015 MERS-CoV (n = 2,009) epidemics were included. Participants were selected post-stratiﬁcation by sex, age, and province. The total number of weighted cases in this survey equaled the total number of unweighted cases at the national level. We measured the levels of preventive behaviors (social distancing [avoiding physical contact with others]), and practicing transmission-reducing behaviors such as wearing face mask and handwashing. RESULTS: Between the surveys, respondents who reported practicing social distancing increased from 41.9%–58.2% (MERS-CoV) to 83.4%–92.3% (COVID-19). The response rate for the four surveys ranged between 13.7% and 17.7%. Practicing transmission-reducing behaviors (wearing face masks and handwashing) at least once during COVID-19 (78.8%, 80.2%) also increased compared to that during MERS-CoV (15.5%, 60.3%). The higher affective risk perception groups were more likely to practice transmission-reducing measures (adjusted odds ratio, 3.24–4.81; 95 confidence interval, 1.76–6.96) during both COVID-19 and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSION: The study findings suggest markedly increased proportions of non-pharmaceutical behavioral practices evenly across all subgroups during the two different novel virus outbreaks in Korea. Strategic interventions are needed to attempt based on preventive behavior works.","Jang, Won Mo; Jang, Deok Hyun; Lee, Jin Yong",J Korean Med Sci,194,20

However, there are still uncertainties about the effects of PT on the organs in direct contact with the irradiated volume. The aim of this prospective series was to report 6-month follow-up of clinical and functional optic neuropathy rates of patients treated by proton therapy using a standardized comprehensive optic examination. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Standardized ophthalmological examinations were performed to analyze subclinical anomalies in a systematic way before treatment and 6 months after the end of proton therapy with: Automatic visual field, Visual evoked potential (VEP) and optic coherence of tomography (OCT). RESULTS: From October 2018 to July 2020 we analyzed 81 eyes. No significant differences were found in the analysis of the clinical examination of visual functions by the radiation oncologist. However, considering VEP, the impairment was statistically significant for both fibers explored at 30’angle (p:0.007) and 60’angle (p <0.001). In patients with toxicity, the distance of the target volume from the optical pathways was more important with a p-value for 30’VEP at 0.035 and for 60’VEP at 0.039. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm uncertainties concerning relative biological effectiveness of proton therapy, linear energy transfer appears to be more inhomogeneous especially in areas close to the target volumes. The follow-up of patients after proton therapy is not an easy process to set up but it is necessary to improve our knowledges about the biological effects of proton therapy in real life. Our study which will continue during the coming years, suggests that follow-up with in-depth examinations such as VEP as a biomarker could improve the detection of early abnormalities.","Lecornu, Marie; Lesueur, Paul; Salleron, Julia; Balosso, Jacques; Stefan, Dinu; Kao, William; Plouhinec, Tiphaine; Vela, Anthony; Dutheil, Pauline; Bouter, Jordan; Marty, Pierre-Alban; Thariat, Juliette; Quintyn, Jean-Claude",Front Oncol,194,9

Neutralizing antibodies provide efficient blockade for viral infection and are a promising category of biological therapies. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) as a bait, we generate a panel of humanized single domain antibodies (sdAbs) from a synthetic library. These sdAbs reveal binding kinetics with the equilibrium dissociation constant (K(D)) of 0.99–35.5 nM. The monomeric sdAbs show half maximal neutralization concentration (EC(50)) of 0.0009–0.07 µg/mL and 0.13–0.51 µg/mL against SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes, and authentic SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Competitive ligand-binding experiments suggest that the sdAbs either completely block or significantly inhibit the association between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and viral entry receptor ACE2. Fusion of the human IgG1 Fc to sdAbs improve their neutralization activity by up to ten times. These results support neutralizing sdAbs as a potential alternative for antiviral therapies.","Chi, Xiaojing; Liu, Xiuying; Wang, Conghui; Zhang, Xinhui; Li, Xiang; Hou, Jianhua; Ren, Lili; Jin, Qi; Wang, Jianwei; Yang, Wei",Nat Commun,194,10

METHODS: We conducted a matched cohort study using national Veterans Affairs data. Among non‐deceased individuals on January 1, 2020 who received VA care in 2019, we matched RA to non‐RA patients (1:1) on age, sex, and VA site. COVID‐19 and severe COVID‐19 (hospitalization or death) were obtained from a national VA COVID‐19 surveillance database through December 10, 2020. We used multivariable Cox models to compare the risk of COVID‐19 and COVID‐19 hospitalization or death after adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, health behaviors, and county level COVID‐19 incidence rates. RESULTS: RA and non‐RA patients (n=33,886 each) were male predominant (84.5%) and had a mean age of 67.8 years. During follow‐up, there were 1,503 COVID‐19 diagnoses, 388 severe COVID‐19 cases, and 228 non‐COVID‐19 related deaths. After multivariable adjustment, RA was associated with a higher risk of COVID‐19 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.25 [95% confidence interval 1.13, 1.39]) and COVID‐19 hospitalization or death (HR 1.35 [1.10, 1.66]). DMARDs and prednisone, but not RA autoantibody seropositivity, as well as black race, Hispanic ethnicity, and several chronic conditions were associated with COVID‐19 and COVID‐19 hospitalization or death. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RA are at higher risk for COVID‐19 and COVID‐19 hospitalization or death than non‐RA. With a COVID‐19 risk that approaches other recognized chronic conditions, these findings suggest RA patients should be prioritized for COVID‐19 prevention and management.","England, Bryant R.; Roul, Punyasha; Yang, Yangyuna; Kalil, Andre C.; Michaud, Kaleb; Thiele, Geoffrey M.; Sauer, Brian C.; Baker, Joshua F.; Mikuls, Ted R.",Arthritis Rheumatol,194,26

We included studies with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by qRT-PCR and influenza virus infection (A and/or B) by nucleic acid tests. The proportion of co-infection was compared between children and adults, and between critically ill or deceased patients compared to overall patients. Fifty-four articles were included. The overall proportion of co-infection was 0.7%, 95%CI = [0.4 – 1.3]. Most influenza co-infections were due to the influenza A virus (74.4%). The proportion of co-infection with influenza viruses among children (3.2%, 95% CI = [0.9 – 10.9]) was significantly higher than that in adult patients (0.3%, 95% CI = [0.1 – 1.2]), p-value <0.01.

Screening for pathogens in co-infection, particularly influenza viruses in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, is necessary. This warrants close surveillance and investigation of the co-incidences and interactions of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, which is facilitated by the expansion of syndromic diagnosis approaches through the use of multiplex PCR assays.","Dao, Thi Loi; Hoang, Van Thuan; Colson, Philippe; Million, Matthieu; Gautret, Philippe",Journal of Clinical Virology Plus,194,30

Although there is a growing concern on mental health of university students across the globe, studies from low and middle income countries such as Pakistan are scarce. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence of depressive symptoms among Pakistani university students. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, PsycInfo and Google Scholar were searched between 15 to 30th January 2020. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, published till 31st December 2019 were included. Data on study characteristics and prevalence of depressive symptoms were extracted. Meta-analysis was conducted using random effects models. To estimate subgroup difference based on study characteristics, meta-regression and sub-group analyses were conducted. Results: In total, 26 studies involving 7,652 participants were included in review. Overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was 42.66% (95% CI: 34.82% to 50.89%), with significant heterogeneity among studies. Subgroup analyses revealed a significant difference in prevalence estimates based on depression screening instrument and study major. Statistically significant differences were observed among studies employing different psychometric scales (test for subgroup differences, Q = 21.92, p < 0.05) and between students from different study majors (test for subgroup differences, Q = 3.76, p = 0.05). Conclusion: Our study found that overall prevalence of depressive symptoms among university students in Pakistan was 42.66%, however, findings should be interpreted with caution. Large scale epidemiological surveys using valid and reliable tools are needed to better estimate prevalence of depression among Pakistani university students.","Khan, Muhammad Naeem; Akhtar, Parveen; Ijaz, Saira; Waqas, Ahmed",Front Public Health,194,23

Objective: To determine the association between changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviors with changes in back pain during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine among Brazilian adults. Methods: This was a nationwide survey through online questionnaires using data from 43 134 adults (≥18 years of age). Information on back pain was assessed using questions about episodes of back pain and worsening symptoms during the quarantine. The pattern of movement behaviors adopted before and during the pandemic were considered for physical inactivity (<150 min/week of activity), high TV-viewing (≥4h/d), and high computer/tablet use (≥4h/d). Covariates included sex, age group, academic achievement, skin color, working status during the quarantine, and adherence to the quarantine. Logistic regression models were used for statistical analyses (weighted for national representativity). Results: Becoming inactive (OR=1.76, 95% CI: 1.32, 2.37), with high TV-viewing (OR=1.35, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.61) and high computer/tablet use (OR=1.39, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.73) during the pandemic were associated with a higher incidence of back pain. The incidence of physical inactivity was also associated with increased back pain (OR=2.71, 95%CI: 1.64, 4.48). Conclusions: We conclude that increased physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine are associated with the incidence and worsening symptoms of back pain among Brazilian adults.","Silva, Danilo R.; Werneck, André O.; Malta, Deborah C.; Romero, Dalia; Souza-Júnior, Paulo R.B.; Azevedo, Luiz O.; Barros, Marilisa B.A.; Szwarcwald, Célia L.",Braz J Phys Ther,194,30

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact of socio-demographic factors, health literacy, and adherence on the overall hypertension management in a group of Malaysian hypertensive patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. An anonymous, online cross-sectional study was conducted over three months that involved a group of Malaysian adults with hypertension. A validated, self-administered 30-item questionnaire was prepared in Malay and English languages on Google Forms. The link was then distributed to participants on social media (Facebook and WhatsApp). Following survey validation, a pilot study with 30 participants who met the inclusion criteria was carried out. The total scores for health literacy, adherence, and pandemic impact on hypertension control were calculated and compared across all independent variables. In a total of 144 study participants, controlled blood pressure was reported in 77% (N = 111). There were good levels of adherence and health literacy scores but moderate levels of pandemic impact scores. The total adherence scores showed a statistically significant difference between age groups (χ(2) = 6.48, p = 0.039) and those who reported having controlled and uncontrolled blood pressure (U = 1116, p = 0.001). Moreover, the analysis revealed statistically significant differences in total pandemic impact scores based on the age group (χ(2) = 15.008, p = 0.001), household income (χ(2) = 6.887, p = 0.032), employment (U = 1712, p = 0.006), and marital status (U = 520.5, p < 0.001). The youngest age group (18–39) years, the lowest income group, unemployed and unmarried individuals, had significantly higher pandemic impact scores. This denotes that those individuals were more prone to be negatively affected by the pandemic regarding their hypertension management. Most participants reported relatively controlled blood pressure and good levels of health literacy as well as adherence amidst the pandemic. To a moderate extent, study participants perceived that the pandemic had a negative effect on hypertension management. The perceived negative impact of the pandemic was attributed to several socio-demographic factors, such as age, household income, employment, and marital status.","Elnaem, Mohamed Hassan; Kamarudin, Nur Hasyimah; Syed, Nabeel Kashan; Huri, Hasniza Zaman; Dehele, Inderpal Singh; Cheema, Ejaz",Int J Environ Res Public Health,194,16

Moreover, it is demonstrated that the school environment may play an important role in health promotion with regard to nutritional aspects. This article reports the results of a study conducted in the Apulia region (Southern Italy), aimed at providing an integrated surveillance of the behaviors related to nutrition habits in students and the hygienic and nutritional conditions of the school’s canteens attended by enrolled students. To this purpose, a sample of 501 students attending primary school (third class—children approximately eight years old) replied to a validated questionnaire, and official controls (OC), of both food and nutritional safety, were performed in 22 primary schools. A team of healthcare professionals carried out the study, and the implementation of all the prescribed improvement actions were subsequently verified through follow-up OC. The results of our study show a critical situation in the student sample, with 41.3% of children having a weight excess (overweight or obesity). With regard to the children’s behaviors, only 59.8% of children ate at least one fruit or had a fruit juice for breakfast, and 10.8% did not have breakfast at all. Overall, 40.1% of the total children played outdoors the afternoon before the survey and 45% reported going to school on foot or by bicycle. During the afternoon, 83.5% of the sample watched television or used video games/tablets/mobile phones, while 42.3% played sports. The schools had an internal canteen with on-site preparation of meals in 36.4%, the remaining 63.6% received meals from external food establishments. With regard to OC, for the hygienic–sanitary section, eleven prescriptions were issued, in the great part related to the structure and organization of the canteen. For the nutritional section, nine corrective actions were prescribed, mainly related to official documents and management. The follow-up OC showed that all prescriptions were subsequently addressed. Eating at school was less frequent among obese and overweight students compared with those with normal weight. Although this evidence needs to be further confirmed, it highlights the potential role that the school canteens may play in health promotion and prevention of nutritional disorders. On the other hand, in order to fulfill its health promotion task, the school canteens have to comply with official regulations and guidelines; therefore, OC during the management of the food service at school are needed.","Marcotrigiano, Vincenzo; Stingi, Giacomo Domenico; Fregnan, Simona; Magarelli, Pantaleo; Pasquale, Pietro; Russo, Samuele; Orsi, Giovanni Battista; Montagna, Maria Teresa; Napoli, Christian; Napoli, Christian",Nutrients,194,10

This search yielded 134 hits that were then subjected to multiple rounds of in silico analyses, including blind and focused docking against the 3D structure of the main protease. We scrutinised the poses, scores, and protein–ligand interactions of 15 hits and selected 7. The scaffolds of the seven hits were structurally distinct from known inhibitor scaffolds, thus indicating scaffold novelty.

Currently, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) versus this virus are expected to correlate with recovery and protection of this disease. However, the characteristics of these antibodies have not been well studied in association with the clinical manifestations in patients. Methods Plasma collected from 175 COVID-19 recovered patients with mild symptoms were screened using a safe and sensitive pseudotyped-lentiviral-vector-based neutralization assay. Spike-binding antibody in plasma were determined by ELISA using RBD, S1, and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The levels and the time course of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs and the spike-binding antibodies were monitored at the same time. Findings SARS-CoV-2 NAbs were unable to cross-reactive with SARS-CoV virus. SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs were detected in patients from day 10-15 after the onset of the disease and remained thereafter. The titers of NAb among these patients correlated with the spike-binding antibodies targeting S1, RBD, and S2 regions. The titers of NAbs were variable in different patients. Elderly and middle-age patients had significantly higher plasma NAb titers (P<0.0001) and spike-binding antibodies (P=0.0003) than young patients. Notably, among these patients, there were ten patients whose NAb titers were under the detectable level of our assay (ID50: < 40); while in contrast, two patients, showed very high titers of NAb, with ID50 :15989 and 21567 respectively. The NAb titers were positive correlated with plasma CRP levels but negative correlated with the lymphocyte counts of patients at the time of admission, indicating an association between humoral response and cellular immune response. Interpretation The variations of SARS-CoV-2 specific NAbs in recovered COVID-19 patients may raise the concern about the role of NAbs on disease progression. The correlation of NAb titers with age, lymphocyte counts, and blood CRP levels suggested that the interplay between virus and host immune response in coronavirus infections should be further explored for the development of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, titration of NAb is helpful prior to the use of convalescent plasma for prevention or treatment.

Wildfires resulting in the loss of habitats and emission of particulate matter and volatile organic compounds pose serious threatens to wildlife and human populations, especially for avian species, the respiratory system of which are sensitive to air pollutions. At the same time, the extreme weather (e.g., snowstorms) in late summer may also impact bird migration by cutting off their food supply and promoting their migration before they were physiologically ready. In this study, we investigated the environmental drivers of massive bird die‐offs by combining socioecological earth observations data sets with citizen science observations. We employed the geographically weighted regression models to quantitatively evaluate the effects of different environmental and climatic drivers, including wildfire, air quality, extreme weather, drought, and land cover types, on the spatial pattern of migratory bird mortality across the western and central US during August‐September 2020. We found that these drivers affected the death of migratory birds in different ways, among which air quality and distance to wildfire were two major drivers. Additionally, there were more bird mortality events found in urban areas and close to wildfire in early August. However, fewer bird deaths were detected closer to wildfires in California in late August and September. Our findings highlight the important impact of extreme weather and natural disasters on bird biology, survival, and migration, which can provide significant insights into bird biodiversity, conservation, and ecosystem sustainability.","Yang, Di; Yang, Anni; Yang, Jue; Xu, Rongting; Qiu, Han",Geohealth,194,1

To study the transmission occurring from the hospitals and as well as from the community, we developed a mechanistic model with a lockdown effect. Using daily COVID‐19 cases data from six states and overall India, we estimated several important parameters of our model. Moreover, we provided an estimation of the effective (R(T) ), the basic (R (0)), the community (R (C)), and the hospital (R (H)) reproduction numbers. We forecast COVID‐19 notified cases from May 3, 2020, till May 20, 2020, under five different lockdown scenarios in the seven locations. Our analysis suggests that 65% to 99% of the new COVID‐19 cases are currently asymptomatic in those locations. Besides, about 1–16% of the total COVID‐19 transmission are currently occurring from hospital‐based contact and these percentage can increase up to 69% in some locations. Furthermore, the hospital‐based transmission rate (β(2) ) has significant positive (0.65 to 0.8) and negative (‐0.58 to ‐0.23) correlation with R (0) and the effectiveness of lockdown, respectively. Therefore, a much larger COVID‐19 outbreak may trigger from the hospital‐based transmission. In most of the locations, model forecast from May 3, 2020, till May 20, 2020, indicates a two‐times increase in cumulative cases in comparison to total observed cases up to April 29, 2020. Based on our results, we proposed a containment policy that may reduce the threat of a larger COVID‐19 outbreak in the future.","Sardar, Tridip; Rana, Sourav",Risk Anal,194,9

However, not much research has been done with the rhubarb stalk. The aim of this research is to evaluate the anti-bacterial and anti-proliferative effects of the aqueous extract from rhubarb stalks. The crude aqueous extract was further purified using anion exchange and gel filtration. The purified compound demonstrated broad spectrum antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Gram-positive bacteria, S. aureus. A time-kill assay demonstrated that the antibiotic has strong bactericidal activity. It also has anti-proliferative action against the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 with no cytotoxicity, although the crude extract had a significant cytotoxic effect. The antibiotic activity, as measured by the diameter of the zone of inhibition, increased by several fold in low nutrient and/or low salt agar, suggesting that the antibiotic preferentially kills slow-growing bacteria. The antibiotic also gives an unusual pattern of multiple zones of inhibition in which several zones of cell growth are seen within the zone of inhibition. In conclusion, the active component in the aqueous extract of rhubarb stalk has great potential as a strong bactericidal antibiotic and as an anti-proliferative drug.","Bhattacharjee, Mrinal K.; Bommareddy, Praveen K.; DePass, Anthony L.",Antibiotics (Basel),194,20

Using a mouse model of viral hepatitis, we identified virus-induced early transcriptional changes in the redox pathways in the liver, including downregulation of superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1). Sod1(−/−) mice exhibited increased inflammation and aggravated liver damage upon viral infection, which was independent of T and NK cells and could be ameliorated by antioxidant treatment. Type I interferon (IFN-I) led to a downregulation of Sod1 and caused oxidative liver damage in Sod1(−/−) and wild-type mice. Genetic and pharmacological ablation of the IFN-I signaling pathway protected against virus-induced liver damage. These results delineate IFN-I mediated oxidative stress as a key mediator of virus-induced liver damage and describe a mechanism of innate-immunity-driven pathology, linking IFN-I signaling with antioxidant host defense and infection-associated tissue damage.

It is important to capture differences in anxiety levels among populations, groups, and the gender-related variation. Therefore, the present study had two main purposes: (1) to characterize the levels of state anxiety and trait anxiety by examining gender-related, sleep-related, and physical activity-related variations in a nonrepresentative sample of the Portuguese population during the first weeks of lockdown; and (2) to explore the possible relationship between trait anxiety and state anxiety and the possible role of gender as a moderator. This cross-sectional study comprised 1,332 Portuguese adults (aged 18–55 years old) recruited online during COVID-19 outbreak measures. Participants answered to sociodemographic data and the Portuguese version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Gender differences were found in both state anxiety (p = < 0.001; d = 0.385) and trait anxiety (p = < 0.001; d = 0.467) with females presenting higher values. People reporting doing more physical activity than usual during COVID-19 lockdown presented lower levels of state anxiety (p = < 0.001; d = 0.200). People reporting more satisfaction with the quality of sleep presented lower levels of both state anxiety (p = < 0.001; d = 0.701) and trait anxiety (p = < 0.001; d = 0.899). Variation associated with the physical activity level (low, moderate, and high) was significantly different among groups in both state anxiety (p = < 0.001) and trait anxiety (p = < 0.001). When analyzing in more detail separating the levels of physical activity, participants performing moderate and high physical activity showed lower values of state and trait anxiety compared to participants with low physical activity. Participants performing high physical activity also showed lower values of state anxiety compared to participants performing moderate physical activity. Higher levels of trait anxiety were related to higher levels of state anxiety, but this association was not moderated by gender. Interventions aiming to support people psychologically during this outbreak should consider anxiety as well as gender and possible behavioral changes in sleep and physical activity, for example. Health professionals should not only consider the anxiety related to the situation we are living but also address trait anxiety to help overcome COVID-19 psychological consequences.","Frontini, Roberta; Rebelo-Gonçalves, Ricardo; Amaro, Nuno; Salvador, Rogério; Matos, Rui; Morouço, Pedro; Antunes, Raul",Front Psychol,194,3

Little is known, however, about how unfolding information regarding EVALI affected knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among e-cigarette users, particularly among young adults. This study describes attitudinal and behavioral responses to EVALI among young adult e-cigarette users. In October and November 2019, seven focus groups were held with college-going young adult tobacco users from two four-year public universities in California. Focus groups included questions regarding knowledge of and reaction to EVALI news, and how the news affected product use. Text from current e-cigarette users was extracted to develop individual phenomenological textural-structural descriptions of e-cigarette use for 38 individuals which were used to create a composite experience of e-cigarette use in light of EVALI. Experiences indicated that e-cigarette users were aware of information regarding EVALI and received information from numerous sources. Information was filtered for legitimacy of EVALI claims and causes of EVALI. Risk rationalizations were developed to assess potential harm of continued e-cigarette use and provided reasoning for behavioral responses to EVALI. The emerging harm associated with EVALI prompted e-cigarette users to engage in a cognitive process resulting in employment of a range of rationalities to justify continued use. These results suggest how environmental, cognitive, and behavioral factors may interact as young adults negotiate e-cigarette-related harms.","Yang, Joshua S.; Sou, Angela; Faruqui, Afsana; Mackey, Tim K.",Prev Med Rep,194,21

Psychoanalysts do not use explicit sliding scales but rather reach an agreement about fees in conversation with the patient. This negotiation is conducted with some principles of gift-giving, where parties try to give more, rather than through competitive bargaining (an inverted bazaar). Drawing on the sociology of money, morals and markets, and valuation studies literatures, I distinguish four factors to explain this: 1) Some formally produced prices as well as market mechanisms shape benchmarks for fees, but the peculiar service psychologists offer (which makes quality judgments hard), the way patients and therapists are matched, and the lack of public information about prices allow for high flexibility in price-setting; these are structural factors that remain unsaid in the conversation on fees. 2) A professional narrative that highlights a responsibility towards patients that should not be contaminated by economic interest. 3) Psychoanalysts’ elaborations on the meanings of the payment, which should reflect the uniqueness of each patient and the bond analyst-patient and symbolize the patient’s commitment to treatment, involving a cost and a loss beyond the economic. 4) The prevalence of cash, face-to-face payment without intermediaries, which helps desacralize the analyst and disentangle the session from the rest of the economic life of the analyst, but impedes evading moralization of the transaction. Payments in psychoanalysis are delicate arrangements, and analysts often stress about valuation and payments. They have to be careful to ensure this flexibility results in morally acceptable transactions.","Fridman, Daniel",Theory Soc,194,20

The search for an effective and efficient therapeutic and pharmaceutical intervention is as important and urgent now as it was on Day 1. Majority of the efforts in this direction are toward finding small molecule interventions via repurposing or redirecting the therapeutic approaches. This hypothesis proposes a physical intervention approach directed toward rescuing the complex lung pathology observed in COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (CARDS). The loss of content as well as the synthesis and turnover of the surfactant in ARDS has been termed as a “collateral damage.” A synergistic, early stage, cost-effective, pharmaceutically viable, safe, and immediately available solution is hence required. The effectiveness of exogenous surfactant treatment in ARDS has been marred with several limitations as pointed out in various clinical trials and require revised protocols related to surfactant dose and mode of delivery. This hypothesis proposes aerosolized surfactant delivery taking the optimal dosing and coating costs into account along with co-delivery of ambroxol to provide synergistic benefits. Ambroxol is reported to have anti-inflammatory, -oxidant, -viral, and -bacterial activities and has a direct impact on the production and secretion of the surfactant from the alveolar Type 2 cells. If aerosolized, atomized, or nebulized in the form of ambroxol-loaded phospholipid nanovesicles at the early stages of ARDS, depleted surfactant levels may be reinstated and surfactant turnover can be initiated and maintained. The ability to deliver both the components in aerosolized-nebulized form may have a huge impact on alleviating the healthcare burden in low resource settings where the availability of ventilators is limited. In conclusion, the surfactant-ambroxol co-aerosolized intervention approach hypothesized here has implications reaching to clinical and pharmaceutical translation worldwide.","Kumar, Pradeep",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,194,1

As a consequence, serious mental and emotional responses have been registered. There was a significant decline in physical and other meaningful activities of daily living, leisure, social activity, and education. In children, collateral effects of the pandemic include inadequate nutrition with a risk of both overweight and underweight, addiction to screens, lack of schooling, and psychosocial difficulties. Older adults are frequently unable to adapt to lockdown measures and suffer from depression and cognitive complaints. Recent studies focusing on changes in lifestyle during the Covid-19 pandemic and consequences on mental health have been identified in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Embase, and ScienceDirect. All the available literature has been retrospectively reviewed. The results of the present narrative review suggest that mental distress caused by social isolation seems to be linked not only to personality characteristics but also to several lifestyle components (sleep disruption, altered eating habits, reduced physical activity). This review aims to explore major changes in the lifestyle and quality of life and the impact of these changes on mental health, and to inform clinicians and policymakers about elements that may reduce the negative psychological effects of the quarantine period imposed during this worldwide crisis. There is an urgent need for tailored preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic mental health interventions for the general population and for higher risk groups.","Caroppo, Emanuele; Mazza, Marianna; Sannella, Alessandra; Marano, Giuseppe; Avallone, Carla; Claro, Angelo Emilio; Janiri, Delfina; Moccia, Lorenzo; Janiri, Luigi; Sani, Gabriele",Int J Environ Res Public Health,194,1

Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients comprise a large proportion of this group, yet there is limited knowledge about the presentation, clinical course, and immunosuppression management of this novel infection among heart, lung, liver, pancreas, and kidney transplant recipients. METHODS. We present 21 SOT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and April 22, 2020 at a US high-volume transplant center. Diagnostic workup, clinical course, immunosuppression/antiviral management, and immediate outcomes are described. RESULTS. Twenty-one (15.9%) of 132 symptomatic patients tested were positive. Mean age at diagnosis was 54.8 ± 10.9 years. Median time from transplant was 5.58 years (interquartile range 2.25, 7.33). Median follow-up was 18 days (interquartile range 13, 30). Fourteen patients required inpatient management, with 7 (50%) placed in the intensive care unit (ICU). All transplant types were represented. Nearly 43% exhibited GI symptoms. Over half (56.2%) presented with elevated serum creatinine suggestive of acute kidney injury. The majority of patients (5/7) with concomitant infections at baseline required the ICU. Eighty percent received hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin. Ten received toclizumab and/or ribavirin; 1 received remdesivir. Antimetabolites ± calcineurin inhibitors were held or reduced.

L. infantum). Biomarkers in the canine immune system is an important technique in the course of developing vaccines and treatment strategies against CVL. New methodologies for studying the immune response of dogs during Leishmania infection and after receiving vaccines and treatments against CVL would be useful. In this context, we used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy dogs to evaluate procedures related to (i) establishment of in vitro conditions of monocytes differentiated into macrophages infected with L. chagasi and (ii) purification procedures of T-cell subsets (CD4(+) and CD8(+)) using microbeads. Our data demonstrated that after 5 days of differentiation, macrophages were able to induce significant phagocytic and microbicidal activity after L. chagasi infection and also showed increased frequency of parasitism and a higher parasite load. Although N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAG) levels presented similar levels of macrophage culture and L. chagasi infection, a progressive decrease in myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels was a hallmark over 5 days of culture. High purity levels (>90%) of CD4 and CD8 T cells were obtained on a magnetic separation column. We concluded that monocytes differentiated into macrophages at 5 days and displayed an intermediate frequency of parasitism and parasite load 72 h after L. chagasi infection. Furthermore, the purification system using canine T-lymphocyte subsets obtained after 5 days of monocyte differentiation proved efficient for CD4 or CD8 T-cell purification (≥90%). The in vitro analysis using L. chagasi-infected macrophages and purified T cells presented a prospective methodology that could be incorporated in CVL vaccine and treatment studies that aim to analyze the microbicidal potential induced by specific CD4(+) and/or CD8(+) T cells.","Viana, Kelvinson Fernandes; Aguiar-Soares, Rodrigo Dian Oliveira; Roatt, Bruno Mendes; Resende, Lucilene Aparecida; Silveira-Lemos, Denise da; Corrêa-Oliveira, Rodrigo; Martins-Filho, Olindo Assis; Moura, Sandra Lima; Zanini, Marcos Santos; Araújo, Márcio Sobreira Silva; Reis, Alexandre Barbosa; Giunchetti, Rodolfo Cordeiro",Vet Parasitol,194,16

Yet, little is known on the role in the HCV life cycle of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), one of the most important kinases in cellular metabolism. Therefore, the impact of GSK3 on the HCV life cycle was assessed in human hepatoma cell lines harboring subgenomic genotype 1b and 2a replicons or producing cell culture-derived HCV genotype 2a by exposure to synthetic GSK3 inhibitors, GSK3 gene silencing, overexpression of GSK3 constructs and immunofluorescence analyses. In addition, the role of GSK3 in hepatitis E virus (HEV) replication was investigated to assess virus specificity of the observed findings. We found that both inhibition of GSK3 function by synthetic inhibitors as well as silencing of GSK3β gene expression resulted in a decrease of HCV replication and infectious particle production, whereas silencing of the GSK3α isoform had no relevant effect on the HCV life cycle. Conversely, overexpression of GSK3β resulted in enhanced HCV replication. In contrast, GSK3β had no effect on replication of subgenomic HEV replicon. The pro-viral effect of GSK3β on HCV replication was mediated by supporting expression of microRNA-122 (miR-122), a micro-RNA which is mandatory for wild-type HCV replication, as GSK3 inhibitors suppressed miR-122 levels and as inhibitors of GSK3 had no antiviral effect on a miR-122-independent HCV mutant. In conclusion, we have identified GSK3β is a novel host factor supporting HCV replication by maintaining high levels of hepatic miR-122 expression.","Saleh, Maged; Rüschenbaum, Sabrina; Welsch, Christoph; Zeuzem, Stefan; Moradpour, Darius; Gouttenoire, Jérôme; Lange, Christian M.",Front Microbiol,194,16

The rate of transmission remains high during airway management. This was evident during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic where those who were involved in tracheal intubation had a higher risk of infection than those who were not involved (odds ratio 6.6). We describe specific airway management principles for patients with known or suspected COVID-19 disease for an array of critical care and procedural settings. We conducted a thorough search of the available literature of airway management of COVID-19 across a variety of international settings. In addition, we have analyzed various medical professional body recommendations for common procedural practices such as interventional cardiology, gastroenterology, and pulmonology. A systematic process that aims to protect the operators involved via appropriate personal protective equipment, avoidance of unnecessary patient contact and minimalization of periprocedural aerosol generation are key components to successful airway management. For operating room cases requiring general anesthesia or complex interventional procedures, tracheal intubation should be the preferred option. For interventional procedures, when tracheal intubation is not indicated, cautious conscious sedation appears to be a reasonable approach. Awake intubation should be avoided unless it is absolutely necessary. Extubation is a high-risk procedure for aerosol and droplet spread and needs thorough planning and preparation. As updates and modifications in the management of COVID-19 are still evolving, local guidelines, appraised at regular intervals, are vital in optimizing clinical management.","Thiruvenkatarajan, Venkatesan; Wong, David T.; Kothandan, Harikrishnan; Sekhar, Vimal; Adhikary, Sanjib Das; Currie, John; Van Wijk, Roelof",Anesth Analg,194,21

Understanding the mechanisms regulating this process could reveal potential therapeutic targets for stimulating adult olfactory neurogenesis under pathological conditions and aging. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in astrocytes promotes forebrain neurogenesis but its function in the olfactory system is unknown. Here, we show in mouse olfactory epithelium that CNTF is expressed in horizontal basal cells, olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) and a small subpopulation of OSNs. CNTF receptor alpha was expressed in Mash1-positive globose basal cells (GBCs) and OECs. Thus, CNTF may affect GBCs in a paracrine manner. CNTF−/− mice did not display altered GBC proliferation or olfactory function, suggesting that CNTF is not involved in basal olfactory renewal or that they developed compensatory mechanisms. Therefore, we tested the effect of increased CNTF in wild type mice. Intranasal instillation of a focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor, FAK14, upregulated CNTF expression. FAK14 also promoted GBC proliferation, neuronal differentiation and basal stem cell self-renewal but had no effective in CNTF−/− mice, suggesting that FAK inhibition promotes olfactory neuroregeneration through CNTF, making them potential targets to treat sensorineural anosmia due to OSN loss.","Jia, Cuihong; Oliver, Joe; Gilmer, Dustin; Lovins, Chiharu; Rodriguez-Gil, Diego J.; Hagg, Theo",Stem Cell Res,194,1

They discovered a relationship between the whole microbial colonization and the initiation and development of different medical disorders. Besides already known probiotics, novel products such as postbiotics and paraprobiotics have been developed in recent years to create new non-viable micro-organisms or bacterial-free extracts, which can provide benefits to the host with additional bioactivity to probiotics, but without the risk of side effects. The best alternatives in the use of probiotics and postbiotics to maintain the health of the intestinal microbiota and to prevent the attachment of pathogens to children and adults are highlighted and discussed as controversies and challenges. Updated knowledge of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the balance between microbiota and immune system for the introspection on the gut–lung–brain axis could reveal the latest benefits and perspectives of applied photobiomics for health. Multiple interconditioning between photobiomodulation (PBM), probiotics, and the human microbiota, their effects on the human body, and their implications for the management of viral infectious diseases is essential. Coupled complex PBM and probiotic interventions can control the microbiome, improve the activity of the immune system, and save the lives of people with immune imbalances. There is an urgent need to seek and develop innovative treatments to successfully interact with the microbiota and the human immune system in the coronavirus crisis.

The immune response of pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2 and the interplay of how the maternal immune response affects neonatal passive immunity have not been systematically studied. Objectives We characterized the serologic response in pregnant women and studied how this serologic response correlates with maternal clinical presentation and with the rate and level of passive immunity from mothers to neonates. Study Design Between March 22-May 31, 2020, women giving birth who tested positive for semi-quantitative IgM or IgG detection in a New York City Hospital were included in the study. Retrospective chart review of the cases that met inclusion criteria was conducted for presence of COVID19 symptoms and use of oxygen support. Serology levels between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were compared with Welch’s two sample t-test. Further chart review of the same patient cohort was conducted in order to identify dates of self-reported onset of COVID-19 symptoms, and the timing of the peak of IgM and IgG antibody levels after symptoms onset were visualized using local polynomial regression smoothing (LOESS) on log2-scaled serological values. To study the neonatal serology response, cord blood samples of neonates born to a subset of all serology positive pregnant women were tested for serology. Maternal antibody levels of serology-positive vs. serology-negative neonates were compared with the Welch’s two sample t-test. The relationship between quantitative maternal and quantitative neonatal serologic data was studied using Pearson correlation and linear regression. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted using maternal symptoms, maternal serology levels, and maternal use of oxygen support to determine predictors of neonatal IgG levels. Results Eighty-eight serology positive pregnant women were included in this study. Antibody levels are higher in symptomatic pregnant women compared to asymptomatic pregnant women. Serology studies in 34 women with symptom onset data reveal that maternal IgM and IgG levels peak around 15 and 30 days post COVID-19 symptoms onset, respectively. Furthermore, studies of fifty neonates born to a subset of serology positive women show that passive immunity in the form of IgG is conferred upon 78% of all neonates. Presence of passive immunity is dependent on maternal antibody levels, and levels of neonatal IgG correlate with maternal IgG levels. Maternal IgG levels and maternal use of oxygen support were predictive of neonatal IgG levels. Conclusions We demonstrate that maternal serologies correlate with symptomatic maternal infection, and higher levels of maternal antibodies are associated with passive immunity. Maternal IgG levels and maternal use of oxygen support, a marker of disease severity, predict neonatal IgG levels. These data will further guide the screening for this unique linked population of mothers and their babies, and can aid in developing maternal vaccination strategies.","Kubiak, Jeffrey M.; Murphy, Elisabeth A.; Yee, Jim; Cagino, Kristen; Friedlander, Rachel L.; Glynn, Shannon M.; Matthews, Kathy C.; Jurkiewicz, Magdalena; Sukhu, Ashley C.; Zhao, Zhen; Prabhu, Malavika; Riley, Laura; Yang, Yawei J.",Am J Obstet Gynecol,194,16

Planning effective public health control measures for such a case will be highly dependent on sound theory-based research on how people perceive the risks involved in such an event. PURPOSE: The present article aims to review theoretical models and concepts underlying current empirical research on pandemic influenza risk perception. METHOD: A review was conducted based on 28 empirical studies from 30 articles which were published between 2003 and 2007. RESULTS: Concepts of risk perception mostly seemed more pragmatic than theory-based and were highly heterogeneous, for instance, in terms of conceptualizing risk perception as an exclusively cognitive or as a cognitive and emotional phenomenon or whether the concept was dominated by expectancy or expectancy and value components. Similarly, the majority of studies investigating risk perceptions and protective behaviors were not model-based. CONCLUSIONS: The current body of knowledge can only provide preliminary insights. Unlike the reviewed studies, which were mostly launched as a rapid response to outbreak situations, future research will have to invest more strongly into theoretical work to provide sounder evidence.","Leppin, Anja; Aro, Arja R.",Int J Behav Med,194,20

This review will summarize recent data supporting the use of these drugs as novel therapies in various allergic disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown that BTKis can prevent IgE-mediated degranulation and cytokine production in primary human mast cells and basophils. Two oral doses of the second-generation BTKi acalabrutinib can completely prevent moderate passive systemic anaphylaxis in humanized mice and even protect against death during severe anaphylaxis. Furthermore, two doses of ibrutinib can reduce or eliminate skin prick test responses to foods and aeroallergens in allergic subjects. BTKis in development also show efficacy in clinical trials for chronic urticaria. Unlike other therapies targeting IgE, such as omalizumab, BTKis appear to have rapid onset and transient effects, making them ideal candidates for intermittent use to prevent acute reactions such as IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. SUMMARY: These studies suggest that BTKis may be capable of preventing IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, paving the way for future trials in food allergy and urticaria.","Dispenza, Melanie C.",Curr Treat Options Allergy,194,1

The identification of signature sequences in overlapping genes is a topic of particular interest, since additional out-of-frame coding regions can be nested within known genes. In this work, a novel feature peculiar to overlapping coding regions is presented. It was detected by analysis of a sample set of 21 virus genomic sequences and consisted in the repeated occurrence of a cluster of basic amino acid residues, encoded by a frame, combined to a stretch of acidic residues, encoded by the corresponding overlapping frame. A computer scan of an additional set of virus sequences demonstrated that this feature is common to several other known overlapping ORFs and led to prediction of a novel overlapping gene in hepatitis G virus (HGV). The occurrence of a bifunctional coding region in HGV was also supported by its extremely lower rate of synonymous nucleotide substitutions compared to that observed in the other gene regions of the HGV genome. Analysis of the amino acid sequence that was deduced from the putative overlapping gene revealed a high content of basic residues and the presence of a nuclear targeting signal; these characteristics suggest that a core-like protein may be expressed by this novel ORF.","Pavesi, Angelo",J Mol Evol,194,19

Between April 8, 2020, and May 2, 2020, adult students (N = 1,821) across the CUNY system completed an online survey examining COVID‐19–related stressors and mental health and sociodemographic factors. Using multivariable logistical regression to assess the association between COVID‐19–related stressors and depression and anxiety symptoms, we found a high prevalence and severity of depression and anxiety symptoms. We also observed that more exposure to COVID‐19–related stressors was associated with increased depressive (27.0%, 41.4%, and 63.1% for low‐, medium‐, and high‐level stressors, respectively) and anxiety symptoms (19.3%, 34.6%, 52.2%). In addition, the degree of exposure to COVID‐19–related stressors served as an important predictor of depression and anxiety symptoms.

However, the use of hydroxychloroquine alone was associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion. The use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19 patients, seems to be effective. The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has shown synergic effects. However, mortality rate was increased when the treatment was conducted with hydroxychloroquine.","Yang, T.-H.; Chou, C.-Y.; Yang, Y.-F.; Yang, Y.-P.; Chien, C.-S.; Yarmishyn, A.

HACE1 has been characterized as an important tumor suppressor. Here, we identified HACE1 as an important negative regulator of virus-triggered type I IFN signaling. Overexpression of HACE1 inhibited Sendai virus- or poly (I:C)-induced signaling and resulted in reduced IFNB1 production and enhanced virus replication. Knockdown of HACE1 expression exhibited the opposite effects. Ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of the dead mutant HACE1/C876A had a comparable inhibitory function as WT HACE1, suggesting that the suppressive function of HACE1 on virus-induced signaling is independent of its E3 ligase activity. Further study indicated that HACE1 acted downstream of MAVS and upstream of TBK1. Mechanistic studies showed that HACE1 exerts its inhibitory role on virus-induced signaling by disrupting the MAVS-TRAF3 complex. Therefore, we uncovered a novel function of HACE1 in innate immunity regulation.","Mao, He-Ting; Wang, Yan; Cai, Juan; Meng, Jun-Ling; Zhou, Yu; Pan, Yu; Qian, Xiao-Ping; Zhang, Yu; Zhang, Jun",Viruses,194,2

Current therapeutic treatments for Lassa fever are limited, making the development of novel countermeasures an urgent priority. In this study, we identified losmapimod, a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, from 102 screened compounds as an inhibitor of LASV infection. Losmapimod exerted its inhibitory effect against LASV after p38 MAPK down-regulation, and, interestingly, had no effect on other arenaviruses capable of causing viral hemorrhagic fever. Mechanistic studies showed that losmapimod inhibited LASV entry by affecting the stable signal peptide (SSP)-GP2 subunit interface of the LASV glycoprotein, thereby blocking pH-dependent viral fusion. As an aryl heteroaryl bis-carboxyamide derivative, losmapimod represents a novel chemical scaffold with anti-LASV activity, and it provides a new lead structure for the future development of LASV fusion inhibitors.","Zhang, Xiaoyu; Yan, Feihu; Tang, Ke; Chen, Qing; Guo, Jiamei; Zhu, Wenjun; He, Shihua; Banadyga, Logan; Qiu, Xiangguo; Guo, Ying",Antiviral Res,194,1

Here, we characterized polyclonal IgGs and Fabs from COVID-19 convalescent individuals for recognition of coronavirus spikes. Plasma IgGs differed in their focus on RBD epitopes, recognition of alpha- and beta-coronaviruses, and contributions of avidity to increased binding/neutralization of IgGs over Fabs. Using electron microscopy, we examined specificities of polyclonal plasma Fabs, revealing recognition of both S1A and RBD epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 spike. Moreover, a 3.4Å cryo-EM structure of a neutralizing monoclonal Fab-spike complex revealed an epitope that blocks ACE2 receptor binding. Modeling based on these structures suggested different potentials for inter-spike crosslinking by IgGs on viruses and that characterized IgGs would not be affected by identified SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations.

Next, we found that ALV-J CHN06 strain infection of DF-1 cells correlated with extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) activation, which was mainly induced within 15 min, a very early stage of infection, and at a late infection stage, from 108 h to 132 h post-infection. Infection with other ALV subgroup (A/B) strains also triggered ERK/MAPK activation. Moreover, when activating ERK2, ALV subgroups A, B and J simultaneously induced the phosphorylation of c-Jun, an AP1 family member and p38 activation but had no obvious effect on JNK activation at either 15 min or 120 h. Interestingly, only PD98059 inhibited the ALV-induced c-Jun phosphorylation while SP600125 or SB203580 had no influence on c-Jun activation. Furthermore, the viral gp85 and gag proteins were found to contribute to ERK2/AP1 activation. Additionally, the specific ERK inhibitor, PD980509, significantly suppressed ALV replication, as evidenced by extremely low levels of ALV promoter activity and ALV-J protein expression. In vivo analysis of ERK2 activation in tumor cells derived from ALV-J-infected chicken demonstrated a strong correlation between ERK/MAPK activation and virus-associated tumorigenesis.","Dai, Manman; Feng, Min; Ye, Yu; Wu, Xiaochan; Liu, Di; Liao, Ming; Cao, Weisheng",Sci Rep,194,30

SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-NL63 recognize ACE2 as the natural receptor but present a distinct binding interface to ACE2 and a different network of residue-residue contacts. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have comparable binding affinities achieved by balancing energetics and dynamics. The SARS-CoV-2–ACE2 complex contains a higher number of contacts, a larger interface area, and decreased interface residue fluctuations relative to SARS-CoV. These findings expose an exceptional evolutionary exploration exerted by coronaviruses toward host recognition.

Disruption of E protein may reduce viral infectivity. Thus, the SARS-CoV E protein is considered a potential target for the development of antiviral drugs. However, the cellular immune responses to E protein remain unclear in humans. In this study, we found that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from fully recovered SARS individuals rapidly produced IFN-γ and IL-2 following stimulation with a pool of 9 peptides overlapping the entire E protein sequence. Analysis of the immune responses by flow cytometry showed that both CD4(+) and CD8(+)T cells were involved in the SARS-CoV E-specific immune responses after stimulation with SARS-CoV E peptides. Moreover, the majority of IFN-γ(+)CD4(+)T cells were central memory cells expressing CD45RO(+)CCR7(+)CD62L(−); whereas IFN-γ(+)CD8(+) memory T cells were mostly effector memory cells expressing CD45RO(−)CCR7(−)CD62L(−). The results of T-cell responses to 9 individual peptides indicated that the E protein contained at least two major T cell epitopes (E2 amino acid [aa] 9–26 and E5–6: aa 33–57) which were important in eliciting cellular immune response to SARS-CoV E protein in humans.","Peng, Hui; Yang, Li-tao; Li, Jian; Lu, Zhi-qiang; Wang, Ling-yun; Koup, Richard A.; Bailer, Robert T.; Wu, Chang-you",Microbes Infect,194,24

The main question is how Israeli sex workers perceive the public debate over governing the Israeli sex industry. METHODS: This study combines qualitative methods that include ethnographic observations and interviews. The ethnographic observations were carried out between November 2018 and October 2019 in gatherings, protests, and academic conferences where sex workers were the lead speakers. In addition, 16 in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with sex workers across various indoor sectors, and four interviews were conducted with political figures to learn about their efforts to adopt neo-abolitionist legislation. RESULTS: the Israeli legislative proceedings initiated in 2007 deny sex workers a voice and exclude them from the political space and policy debates that have a direct bearing on their working lives and wellbeing. Thus, Israeli sex workers perceive sex work governance as controlling their agency and deepening their stigmatization. In this process, we show how contrasting groups became strange bedfellows in their attempt to protect sex workers by incriminating clients of the sex industry. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the binary framings of debates about sex work in Israel do not address the actual needs or political desires of sex workers who are ignored and excluded from the discourse about them. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Furthermore, we conclude that the issue at hand is not about permitting sex workers to express their views but rather about the need to listen to their critiques to ensure that policy is built on their knowledge and experience.","Levy-Aronovic, Stephanie; Lahav-Raz, Yeela; Raz, Aviad",Sex Res Social Policy,194,28

Nevertheless, in ageing, especially if signs of dementia appear, it becomes difficult to assess decision-making ability and raises ethical questions. Currently, the assessment of DMC is based on the clinician’s evaluation, completed by neuropsychological tests. Functional MRI (fMRI) could bring added value to the diagnosis of DMC in difficult situations. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: IMAGISION is a prospective, monocentric, single-arm study evaluating fMRI compared with clinical assessment of DMC. The study will begin during Fall 2021 and should be completed by Spring 2023. Participants will be recruited from a memory clinic where they will come for an assessment of their cognitive abilities due to decision-making needs to support ageing in place. They will be older people over 70 years of age, living at home, presenting with a diagnosis of mild dementia, and no exclusion criteria of MRI. They will be clinically assessed by a geriatrician on their DMC, based on the neuropsychological tests usually performed. Participants will then perform a behavioural task in fMRI (Balloon Analogue Risk Task) to analyse the activation areas. Additional semistructured interviews will be conducted to explore real life implications. The main analysis will study concordance/discordance between the clinical classification and the activation of fMRI regions of interest. Reclassification as ‘capable’, based on fMRI, of patients for whom clinical diagnosis is ‘questionable’ will be considered as a diagnostic gain.

Impairment of the kidney is not typically seen in Coronavirus infections. The role of kidney infection in MERS is not understood. FINDINGS: A systematic review of communicated and peer-reviewed case reports revealed differences in descriptions of kidney involvement in MERS versus SARS patients. In particular, ARF in MERS patients occurred considerably earlier after a median time to onset of 11 days (SD ±2,0 days) as opposed to 20 days for SARS, according to the literature. In-situ histological staining of the respective cellular receptors for MERS- and SARS-Coronavirus showed highly similar staining patterns with a focus of a receptor-specific signal in kidney epithelial cells. Comparative infection experiments with SARS- and MERS-CoV in primary human kidney cells versus primary human bronchial epithelial cells showed cytopathogenic infection only in kidney cells, and only if infected with MERS-CoV. Kidney epithelial cells produced almost 1000-fold more infectious MERS-CoV progeny than bronchial epithelial cells, while only a small difference was seen between cell types when infected with SARS-CoV. CONCLUSION: Epidemiological studies should analyze kidney impairment and its characteristics in MERS-CoV. Virus replication in the kidney with potential shedding in urine might constitute a way of transmission, and could explain untraceable transmission chains leading to new cases. Individual patients might benefit from early induction of renoprotective treatment.","Eckerle, Isabella; Müller, Marcel A; Kallies, Stephan; Gotthardt, Daniel N; Drosten, Christian",Virol J,194,18

METHODS: An anonymous Internet-based study was conducted between 23 April and 26 June 2020. During the study period, the country underwent phase 3 and phase 4 of the Movement Control Order (MCO), Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO), and Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO). Psychological distress was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which is a 14-item self-assessment scale for measuring distress (total HADS score; HADS-T) with two subscales, namely, anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D). Perceived threat of infection was measured based on the health belief model. RESULTS: From a total of 631 responses received, the proportion of participants with anxiety and depression symptoms (above threshold score of 8 on HADS-A and HADS-D) was 29.0 and 20.9%, respectively. Psychological distress (HADS-T > 16) was reported in 22.3% of the respondents. A total of 16.5% had combined anxiety and depression symptoms. The highest HADS-A (6.10; 95% CI 5.64–6.56), HADS-D (5.61; 95% CI 5.14–6.08), and HADS-T (11.71; 95% CI 10.84–12.58) scores were reported among respondents during phase 4 of the MCO. Partial least square-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) revealed that self-perceived health status, perceived susceptibility, and severity of COVID-19 have the greatest effect, leading to higher HADS-A, HADS-D, and HADS-T scores. CONCLUSION: Heightened psychological distress was evident in cancer survivors particularly during the enforcement of the MCO over COVID-19.

To address these questions, we built a data-driven model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission for China. We estimated that, to prevent local outbreaks to escalate to major widespread epidemics, stringent NPIs need to remain in place at least one year after the start of vaccination. Should NPIs be capable to keep the reproduction number (Rt) around 1.3, a vaccination program could reduce up to 99% of COVID-19 burden and bring Rt below the epidemic threshold in about 9 months. Maintaining strict NPIs throughout 2021 is of paramount importance to reduce COVID-19 burden while vaccines are distributed to the population, especially in large populations with little natural immunity.","Yu, Hongjie; Yang, Juan; Marziano, Valentina; Deng, Xiaowei; Guzzetta, Giorgio; Zhang, Juanjuan; Trentini, Filippo; Cai, Jun; Poletti, Piero; Zheng, Wen; Wang, Wei; Wu, Qianhui; Zhao, Zeyao; Dong, Kaige; Zhong, Guangjie; Viboud, Cecile; Merler, Stefano; Ajelli, Marco",Res Sq,194,5

A better understanding of the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 is crucial to improve treatment modalities and to develop effective prevention strategies. Transcriptomic and proteomic data on the host response against SARS-CoV-2 still have anecdotic character; currently available data from other coronavirus infections are therefore a key source of information. METHODS: We investigated selected molecular aspects of three human coronavirus (HCoV) infections, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, through a network based-approach. A functional analysis of HCoV–host interactome was carried out in order to provide a theoretic host–pathogen interaction model for HCoV infections and in order to translate the results in prediction for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. The 3D model of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the structure of the corresponding SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV S-glycoprotein. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and the host interactome were inferred through published protein–protein interactions (PPI) as well as gene co-expression, triggered by HCoV S-glycoprotein in host cells. RESULTS: Although the amino acid sequences of the S-glycoprotein were found to be different between the various HCoV, the structures showed high similarity, but the best 3D structural overlap shared by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the shared ACE2 predicted receptor. The host interactome, linked to the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mainly highlighted innate immunity pathway components, such as Toll Like receptors, cytokines and chemokines. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we developed a network-based model with the aim to define molecular aspects of pathogenic phenotypes in HCoV infections. The resulting pattern may facilitate the process of structure-guided pharmaceutical and diagnostic research with the prospect to identify potential new biological targets.","Messina, Francesco; Giombini, Emanuela; Agrati, Chiara; Vairo, Francesco; Ascoli Bartoli, Tommaso; Al Moghazi, Samir; Piacentini, Mauro; Locatelli, Franco; Kobinger, Gary; Maeurer, Markus; Zumla, Alimuddin; Capobianchi, Maria R.; Lauria, Francesco Nicola; Ippolito, Giuseppe",J Transl Med,194,5

Data analysis assists such organisations in providing information that could help in decision-making processes. For this purpose, both national and regional health authorities provided health data for further processing and analysis. Shared data must comply with existing data protection and privacy regulations. Therefore, a robust de-identification procedure must be used, and a re-identification risk analysis should also be performed. De-identified data embodies state-of-the-art approaches in Data Protection by Design and Default because it requires the protection of direct and indirect identifiers (not just direct). This article highlights the importance of assessing re-identification risk before data disclosure by analysing a data set of individuals infected by Covid-19 that was made available for research purposes. We stress that it is highly important to make this data available for research purposes and that this process should be based on the state of the art methods in Data Protection by Design and by Default. Our main goal is to consider different re-identification risk analysis scenarios since the information on the intruder side is unknown. Our conclusions show that there is a risk of identity disclosure for all of the studied scenarios. For one, in particular, we proceed to an example of a re-identification attack. The outcome of such an attack reveals that it is possible to identify individuals with no much effort.","Carvalho, Tânia; Faria, Pedro; Antunes, Luís; Moniz, Nuno",PLoS One,194,16

Curriculum codesign and codelivery by people with direct expertise and lived experience,19.88751,1.5396013,2021-09-02,"The aim of the present study was to characterize the aroma profile of olive oil of the “Ntopia” (local) cultivar from the Ionian islands (Zakynthos, Kefalonia, Leukada, and Kerkyra) (Greece), and investigate whether specific volatile compounds could be considered as indicators of olive oil geographical origin, using computational statistics. In this context, 137 olive oil samples were subjected to headspace solid phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry using the internal standard method. Computational statistics on the semi-quantitative data of olive oil samples, as rapid machine learning algorithms, showed that specific volatile compounds could be used as indicators of geographical origin of olive oil of the “Ntopia” cultivar, among the four main Ionian islands. Volatile compounds such as ethanol, pentanal, 2,4-dimethylheptane, 3,7-dimethyl-1,3,6-octatriene (E), 2,5-dimethylnonane, 1-hexanol, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, octanal, dl-Limonene, acetic acid hexyl ester and dodecane could aid to the geographical origin discrimination of “Ntopia” olive oil cultivar when two (Zakynthos and Kefalonia) or four (Zakynthos, Kefalonia, Leukada and Kerkyra) Ionian islands are subjected to statistical analysis. The discrimination rate using the cross-validation method was 100% and 85.7%, respectively. These results were further evaluated using training and holdout partitions, during which a comparable classification rate was obtained.
